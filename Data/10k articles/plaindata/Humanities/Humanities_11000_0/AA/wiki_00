His parents, John MacBain and Margaret McIntyre were not recorded as married when his birth was registered 9 August 1855. A native Gaelic speaker, he learned English at Insh General Assembly school, five miles from Kingussie, in Badenoch (1863–1870), whose teacher was Alexander Mackenzie. As a teenager, he taught for half a year at the Dunmullie School in Boat of Garten (1870–71), attended Baldow School in Badenoch, was employed by the Ordnance Survey in Scotland and Wales (1871–74) and returned to Baldow School for another term. Having obtained a bursary, Macbain was accepted at Old Aberdeen Grammar School (1874) and subsequently studied at King's College, Aberdeen (1876), where he graduated with an MA in philosophy.\n\nIn July 1880, Macbain was appointed rector of Raining's school, Inverness, which had just become the secondary school for the entire highlands. Raining's school became part of the High Public School in 1894–95, for which Macbain continued to work until his death. He was made Legum Doctor at Aberdeen University in 1901 and received his pension in 1905. During the last two decades of his life, Macbain was one of the leading figures in a Gaelic intellectual circle which met in Inverness and Edinburgh. The group included both older members, such as Alexander Nicolson, Alexander Carmichael and Donald Mackinnon, and a younger generation which included Father Allan MacDonald, William J. Watson, George Henderson and Kenneth McLeod. Macbain never married. On 4 April 1907, he died of a cerebral haemorrhage in Stirling. He was buried in his home district Badenoch, in the Rothiemurchus churchyard.\n\nMacbain was involved in a substantial amount of editorial work. He worked together with Rev John Kennedy to publish the numerous transcripts which the late Rev Dr Alexander Cameron (d. 1888) had made from texts found in manuscripts. The result was the two volumes of \"Reliquiae Celticae\" (1892–94). He also published an annotated edition of W. F. Skene's \"The Highlanders of Scotland\" (1902) and of the \"History of the Mathesons\" by his former teacher Alexander Mackenzie; contributed to an edition of Ewan MacEachen's \"Gaelic Dictionary\"; and was editor for \"Celtic Magazine\" (1886–1888) and \"Highland Monthly\" (1889–1902).\n\nMany individual papers were published in the \"Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness\" and Transactions of the Inverness Field Club. His first book was \"Celtic Mythology and Religion\", which appeared in 1885 (reprinted 1917). The work for which he is best known today is the philological milestone \"An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language\" (1896). Macbain published a critical edition of the Book of Deer and contributed entries on the Picts in \"Chambers's Encyclopaedia\", articles for magazines and newspapers and reviews for the \"Transactions of the Gaelic Society of Inverness\" (1880–1903). He was responsible for two popular textbooks, \"Gaelic Reader\" and, together with John Whyte, \"How to Learn Gaelic\".\n\nMacBain was highly critical of Skene's position of the Pictish language as Q-Celtic in character. It has been suggested that the degree of animosity evident in MacBain's treatment of Skene may have been for personal reasons and that he was biased against him.\n\n\n\n"}

It consists of several disciplines such as anthropology, sociology, linguistics, historiography, archaeology, Anthropology, Cultural studies, Economics, Geography, History, International relations, Law, Literature, Philosophy, Psychology, Political science, Public administration and Sociology. The field draws from old Arabic chronicles, records and oral literature, in addition to written accounts and traditions about Arabs from explorers and geographers in the Arab World (Middle East-North Africa).\n\nArab studies talk about the history of the Middle East and North Africa, before the rise of Islam to the present time. Covering a wide range of topics, such as methods, approaches, colonial history, gender, environmental and legal dimensions. It depends on the political, economic, social and cultural history of the region.\n\nArabic is a language spoken by more than 422 million people from the ocean to the Gulf, as the Arabs say. This includes Morocco, Mauritania and Western Sahara in the west, and extends to Iraq, the Gulf states and Somalia in the east. The official language of 26 countries, one of the six official languages of the United Nations. It is also the sacred language of over 1.7 billion Muslims around the world, and the language written by some of the greatest works of literature, science and history in the world. According to the teachings of Islam, classical Arabic is the language in which God chose to speak to mankind through Muhammad in the seventh century of the Christian era. It is the language of the Quran, the holy book of Islam. This is the language of Islamic and classical texts. Modern Arabic is the language of books, news broadcasts, poetry and political speeches throughout the Arab world, a language that every child in primary school learns to read and write, a diverse language of Arabic poetic traditions, the precise language of theologians and theologians of the Internet. Knowledge of Arabic provides an opportunity to connect with people throughout the Middle East, providing access to the richness and passion of the contemporary Arab world. Arabic is a way to explore nearly 14 centuries of one of the most sophisticated, diverse, and rich intellectual traditions in the world.\n\nCulture and society in the Arab world, from structures, institutions, art, poetry, letters, practices, and definitions of identity, based on anthropology, sociology, literature and religious studies.\n\nDevelopment and political economy in the Arab world, focusing on economic and social development, education, humanitarian aid, and gender and environmental dimensions of development. This concentration is based on economic history, political economy, sociology and politics.\n\nContemporary political developments in the Arab world and the Middle East. The program covers the study of domineering, nationalism, local institutions, politics, war, peacemaking, identity, security policies and environmental security. It relies on comparative policies, international relations, history, science, political economy and development.\n\nTo understand the history of Arabs provides the indispensable basis to understand all aspects of Arabs and its culture. Themes of special interest are: \n\n\"Kalam\" () is one of the \"religious sciences\" of Islam. In Arabic, the word means \"discussion\" and refers to the Arabic tradition of seeking theological principles through dialectic. A scholar of \"kalam\" is referred to as a \"mutakallim\".\n\nArabic philosophy is a part of Arab studies. It is a longstanding attempt to create harmony between faith, reason or philosophy, and the religious teachings of Arabs. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a Arab philosopher. It is divided in fields like: \n\nArabic science is science in the context of traditional ideas of Arabs, including its ethics and prohibitions. An Arab engaged in this field is called a Muslim scientist This is not the same as science as conducted by any Muslim in a secular context.\n\n\n Arabic architecture is the entire range of architecture that has evolved within Arab culture in the course of the history of Arabs. Hence the term encompasses religious buildings as well as secular ones, historic as well as modern expressions and the production of all places that have come under the varying levels of Islamic influence.\n\n"}

In medieval times, several versions of this anthology circulated in manuscript form among medical students. Between 1476 and 1534, printed editions of the Articella were also published in several European cities.\n\nThe collection grew around a synthetic exposition of classical Greek medicine written in Baghdad by the physician and polyglot Hunayn bin Ishaq, better known in the West as Ioannitius. His synthesis was in turn based on Galen's \"Ars Medica\" (\"Techne iatrike\") and thus became known in Europe as \"Isagoge Ioannitii ad Tegni Galieni\" (\"Hunayn's Introduction to the Art of Galen\").\n\nIn the mid-13th century, the emergence of formal medical education in several European universities fueled a demand for comprehensive textbooks. Instructors from the influential Scuola Medica Salernitana popularized the practice of binding other treatises together with their manuscript copies of the Isagoge.

{"id": "7958278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7958278", "title": "Barilla", "text": "Barilla\n\nBarilla refers to several species of salt-tolerant (halophyte) plants that, until the 19th Century, were the primary source of soda ash and hence of sodium carbonate. The word \"barilla\" was also used directly to refer to the soda ash obtained from plant sources. The word is an anglicization of the Spanish word for saltwort plants (a particular category of halophytes).\n\nA very early reference indicating the value placed upon soda ash in Catalonia has been given by Glick, who notes that \"In 1189 the monastery of Poblet granted to the glassblower Guillem the right to gather glasswort in return for tithe and two hundred pounds of sheet glass paid annually (The site of these glassworks, at Narola, was excavated in 1935.).\" By the 18th Century, Spain's barilla industry was exporting large quantities of soda ash of exceptional purity; the product was refined from the ashes of barilla plants that were specifically cultivated for this purpose. Presumably the word \"barilla\" entered English and other languages as a consequence of this export trade. The main Spanish barilla species included (i) \"Salsola soda\" (the common English term barilla plant for \"Salsola soda\" reflects this usage), (ii) \"Salsola kali\", and (iii) \"Halogeton sativus\" (formerly \"Salsola sativa\"). Fairly recently, Pérez has concluded that the most prominent species was likely \"Halogeton sativus\"; earlier authors have tended to favor \"Salsola soda\".\n\nThe word \"barilla\" was also used directly to refer to soda ash from any plant source, including not only the saltworts grown in Spain, but also glassworts, mangroves, and seaweed. These types of plant-derived soda ash are impure alkali substances that contain widely varying amounts of sodium carbonate (NaCO), some additional potassium carbonate (also an alkali), and a predominance of non-alkali impurities. The sodium carbonate, which is water-soluble, is \"lixiviated\" (extracted with water) from the ashes of the burned, dried plants. The resulting solution is boiled dry to obtain the finished barilla. A very similar process is used to obtain potash (mainly potassium carbonate) from the ashes of hardwood trees. The best Spanish barilla—prepared by master \"barrilleros\"—contained about 30% NaCO. In 1877 Kingzett described the importance of the barilla trade to Spain as follows: \"So highly was the product valued, and the importance of the trade regarded, that by the laws of Spain the exportation of the seed was an offence punishable by death.\"\n\nSome authors indicate that \"barilla\" was a specific plant used for soda ash production; this usage is erroneous, but presumably corresponds to the common usage of \"barilla plant\" exclusively for \"Salsola soda\". Perhaps this common usage itself reflects an old error in assuming that a single plant species was used by the Spaniards for their industry. In still earlier times, the sources of soda ash and the methods of processing it were secrets that were zealously guarded.\n\n"}

{"id": "6258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6258", "title": "Civilization", "text": "Civilization\n\nA civilization or civilisation (see English spelling differences) is any complex society characterized by urban development, social stratification imposed by a cultural elite, symbolic systems of communication (for example, writing systems), and a perceived separation from and domination over the natural environment.\n\nCivilizations are intimately associated with and often further defined by other socio-politico-economic characteristics, including centralization, the domestication of both humans and other organisms, specialization of labour, culturally ingrained ideologies of progress and supremacism, monumental architecture, taxation, societal dependence upon farming and expansionism. Historically, civilization has often been understood as a larger and \"more advanced\" culture, in contrast to smaller, supposedly primitive cultures. Similarly, some scholars have described civilization as being necessarily multicultural. In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies or hunter-gatherers, but it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves. As an uncountable noun, \"civilization\" also refers to the process of a society developing into a centralized, urbanized, stratified structure. Civilizations are organized in densely populated settlements divided into hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.\n\nCivilization, as its etymology (below) suggests, is a concept originally linked to towns and cities. The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally associated with the final stages of the Neolithic Revolution, culminating in the relatively rapid process of urban revolution and state formation, a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite.\n\nThe English word \"civilization\" comes from the 16th-century French \"civilisé\" (\"civilized\"), from Latin \"civilis\" (\"civil\"), related to \"civis\" (\"citizen\") and \"civitas\" (\"city\"). The fundamental treatise is Norbert Elias's \"The Civilizing Process\" (1939), which traces social mores from medieval courtly society to the Early Modern period. In \"The Philosophy of Civilization\" (1923), Albert Schweitzer outlines two opinions: one purely material and the other material and ethical. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, \"the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress\".\n\nAdjectives like \"civility\" developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun \"civilization\", meaning \"civilized condition\", came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by Victor Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau, and the first use in English is attributed to Adam Ferguson, who in his 1767 \"Essay on the History of Civil Society\" wrote, \"Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation\". The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of progress characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment.\n\nIn the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution, \"civilization\" was used in the singular, never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole. This is still the case in French. The use of \"civilizations\" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century, but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning culture (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of ethnography). Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a \"medieval civilization\", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron.\n\nAlready in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement. One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of Rousseau, particularly his work about education, \"\". Here, civilization, being more rational and socially driven, is not fully in accord with human nature, and \"human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original prediscursive or prerational natural unity\" (see noble savage). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by Johann Gottfried Herder, and later by philosophers such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by \"conscious, rational, deliberative acts\", but a kind of pre-rational \"folk spirit\". Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to \"vices of social life\" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice. In World War II, Leo Strauss, having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind Nazism and German militarism and nihilism.\n\nSocial scientists such as V. Gordon Childe have named a number of traits that distinguish a civilization from other kinds of society. Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of government, social stratification, economic systems, literacy and other cultural traits. Andrew Nikiforuk argues that \"civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities\" and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.\n\nAll civilizations have depended on agriculture for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in Peru which may have depended upon maritime resources. Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization, irrigation and crop rotation. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare. Grain surpluses have been especially important because grain can be stored for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included soldiers, artisans, priests and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.\n\nCivilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies. The word \"civilization\" is sometimes simply defined as \"\"'living in cities\"'\". Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.\n\nCompared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the state. State societies are more stratified than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes. The ruling class, normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a government or bureaucracy. Morton Fried, a conflict theorist and Elman Service, an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and social inequality. This system of classification contains four categories\n\nEconomically, civilizations display more complex patterns of ownership and exchange than less organized societies. Living in one place allows people to accumulate more personal possessions than nomadic people. Some people also acquire landed property, or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must trade their goods and services for food in a market system, or receive food through the levy of tribute, redistributive taxation, tariffs or tithes from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a gift economy supplemented by limited barter systems. By the early Iron Age, contemporary civilizations developed money as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites.\n\nWriting, developed first by people in Sumer, is considered a hallmark of civilization and \"appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state\". Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown the Inca civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all except from a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes instead: the \"Quipus\", whose still functioned as a civilized society.\nAided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized religion, development in the arts, and countless new advances in science and technology.\n\nThrough history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some \"primitive\", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. \"Primitive\" implies in some way that a culture is \"first\" (Latin = \"primus\"), that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity, though this has been demonstrated not to be true. Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Anthropologists today use the term \"non-literate\" to describe these peoples.\n\nCivilization has been spread by colonization, invasion, religious conversion, the extension of bureaucratic control and trade, and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.\n\nAssessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trade or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its division of labour, and the carrying capacity of its urban centres. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and tort-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, metallurgy, political structures and organized religion.\n\nTraditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and economic power defined themselves as \"civilized\" as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence – calling the latter barbarians, savages, and primitives. In a modern-day context, \"civilized people\" have been contrasted with indigenous people or tribal societies.\n\n\"Civilization\" can also refer to the culture of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state-based decision making apparatus, a literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion and complex customs of education, coercion and control associated with maintaining the elite.\n\nThe intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being Chinese civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.\n\nMany historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher Oswald Spengler, uses the German word \"Kultur\", \"culture\", for what many call a \"civilization\". Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as \"the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable\".\n\nThis \"unified culture\" concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian Arnold J. Toynbee in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume \"A Study of History,\" which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five \"arrested civilizations\". Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a \"creative minority\", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.\n\nSamuel P. Huntington defines civilization as \"the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species\". Huntington's theories about civilizations are discussed below.\n\nAnother group of theorists, making use of systems theory, looks at a civilization as a complex system, i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex social system and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial but misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.\n\nSystems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the Silk Road through Central Asia and Indian Ocean sea routes linking the Roman Empire, Persian Empire, India and China, were well established 2000 years ago, when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long distance trade is in the ancient world. During the Uruk period, Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan. Resin found later in the Royal Cemetery at Ur is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.\n\nMany theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single \"world system\", a process known as globalization. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration – cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. David Wilkinson has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the \"Central Civilization\" around 1500 BCE. Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the \"clash of civilizations\" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the Crusades as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since ancient times, and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism. \n\nThe notion of world history as a succession of \"civilizations\" is an entirely modern one.\nIn the European Age of Discovery, emerging Modernity was put into stark contrast with the\nNeolithic and Mesolithic stage of the cultures of the New World, suggesting\nthat the complex states had emerged at some time in prehistory.\nThe term \"civilization\" as it is now most commonly understood, a complex state with centralisation, social stratification and specialization of labour, corresponds to early empires that arise in the Fertile Crescent in the Early Bronze Age, around roughly 3000 BC.\nGordon Childe defined the emergence of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the Neolithic Revolution, triggering the development of settled communities, and the Urban Revolution.\n\nAt first, the Neolithic was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move. In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, with the result that population densities could rise significantly.\nThis encouraged a secondary products revolution in which people used domesticated animals not just for meat, but also for milk, wool, manure and pulling ploughs and carts – a development that spread through the Eurasian Oecumene.\n\nThe earlier neolithic technology and lifestyle was established first in Western Asia (for example at Göbekli Tepe, from about 9,130 BCE), and later in the Yellow River and Yangtze basins in China (for example the Pengtoushan culture from 7,500 BCE), and later spread.\nMesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, with civilizations developing from 6,500 years ago. This area has been identified as having \"inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the development of cuneiform script, mathematics, astronomy and agriculture.\"\nSimilar pre-civilized \"neolithic revolutions\" also began independently from 7,000 BCE in northwestern South America (the Norte Chico civilization) and Mesoamerica.\n\nThe 8.2 Kiloyear Arid Event and the 5.9 Kiloyear Interpluvial saw the drying out of semiarid regions and a major spread of deserts. This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of endemic violence between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations.\nThis \"urban revolution\" marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferrable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop. It was associated with the state monopoly of violence, the appearance of a soldier class and endemic warfare, the rapid development of hierarchies, and the appearance of human sacrifice.\n\nThe civilized urban revolution in turn was dependent upon the development of sedentism, the domestication of grains and animals and development of lifestyles that facilitated economies of scale and accumulation of surplus production by certain social sectors. The transition from \"complex cultures\" to \"civilizations\", while still disputed, seems to be associated with the development of state structures, in which power was further monopolized by an elite ruling class who practised human sacrifice.\n\nTowards the end of the Neolithic period, various elitist Chalcolithic civilizations began to rise in various \"cradles\" from around 3300 BCE, expanding into large-scale empires in the course of the Bronze Age (Old Kingdom of Egypt, Akkadian Empire, Assyrian Empire, Old Assyrian Empire, Hittite Empire).\n\nA parallel development took place independently in the Pre-Columbian Americas, where the Mayans began to be urbanised around 500 BCE, and the fully fledged Aztec and Inca emerged by the 15th century, briefly before European contact.\n\nThe Bronze Age collapse was followed by the Iron Age around 1200 BCE, during which a number of new civilizations emerged, culminating in a period from the 8th to the 3rd century BCE which Karl Jaspers termed the Axial Age, presented as a critical transitional phase leading to classical civilization.\nWilliam Hardy McNeill proposed that this period of history was one in which culture contact between previously separate civilizations saw the \"closure of the oecumene\" and led to accelerated social change from China to the Mediterranean, associated with the spread of coinage, larger empires and new religions. This view has recently been championed by Christopher Chase-Dunn and other world systems theorists.\n\nA major technological and cultural transition to modernity began approximately 1500 CE in Western Europe, and from this beginning new approaches to science and law spread rapidly around the world, incorporating earlier cultures into the industrial and technological civilization of the present.\n\nCivilizations have generally ended in one of two ways; either through being incorporated into another expanding civilization (e.g. As Ancient Egypt was incorporated into Hellenistic Greek, and subsequently Roman civilizations), or by collapse and reversion to a simpler form, as happens in what are called Dark Ages.\n\nThere have been many explanations put forward for the collapse of civilization. Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory.\n\nPolitical scientist Samuel Huntington, has argued that the defining characteristic of the 21st century will be a clash of civilizations. According to Huntington, conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between nation-states and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries. These views have been strongly challenged by others like Edward Said, Muhammed Asadi and Amartya Sen. Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris have argued that the \"true clash of civilizations\" between the Muslim world and the West is caused by the Muslim rejection of the West's more liberal sexual values, rather than a difference in political ideology, although they note that this lack of tolerance is likely to lead to an eventual rejection of (true) democracy. In \"Identity and Violence\" Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed \"civilization\", defined by religion and culture only. He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences.\n\nCultural Historian Morris Berman suggests in \"Dark Ages America: the End of Empire\" that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable. Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible. Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, Jane Jacobs who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.\n\nSome environmental scientists also see the world entering a Planetary Phase of Civilization, characterized by a shift away from independent, disconnected nation-states to a world of increased global connectivity with worldwide institutions, environmental challenges, economic systems, and consciousness. In an attempt to better understand what a Planetary Phase of Civilization might look like in the current context of declining natural resources and increasing consumption, the Global scenario group used scenario analysis to arrive at three archetypal futures: Barbarization, in which increasing conflicts result in either a fortress world or complete societal breakdown; Conventional Worlds, in which market forces or policy reform slowly precipitate more sustainable practices; and a Great Transition, in which either the sum of fragmented Eco-Communalism movements add up to a sustainable world or globally coordinated efforts and initiatives result in a new sustainability paradigm.\n\nCultural critic and author Derrick Jensen argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion. Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as \"a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities\", with \"cities\" defined as \"people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life\". This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources. Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles.\n\nThe Kardashev scale classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness. The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist (see also: Civilizations and the Future and Space civilization).\n\n\n"}

The name is etymologically derived from the Greek root κλέω/κλείω (meaning \"to recount,\" \"to make famous,\" or \"to celebrate\").\n\nLike all the muses, she is a daughter of Zeus and the Titaness Mnemosyne, goddess of memory. Along with her sister Muses, she is considered to dwell at either Mount Helicon or Mount Parnassos. Other common locations for the Muses are Pieria in Thessaly, near to Mount Olympus. She had one son, Hyacinth, with one of several kings, in various myths—with Pierus or with king Oebalus of Sparta, or with king Amyclas, progenitor of the people of Amyclae, dwellers about Sparta. Some sources say she is also the mother of Hymenaios. Other accounts credit her as the mother of Linus, a poet who was buried at Argos, although Linus has a number of differing parents depending upon the account, including several accounts in which he is the son of Clio's sisters Urania or Calliope.\n\nIn her capacity as \"the proclaimer, glorifier and celebrator of history, great deeds and accomplishments,\" Clio is the namesake of various modern brands, including the Clio Awards for excellence in advertising. The Cambridge University History Society is informally referred to as Clio, similarly, the Cleo of Alpha Chi society at Trinity College, Connecticut is named after the muse. 'Clio' also represents history in some coined words in academic usage: cliometrics, cliodynamics.\n\n\n"}

The cove of \"Curtis Bay\" with two small branches - Stone House Cove and Cabin Branch is fed from the southwest by Curtis Creek which in turn is formed further south by Marley Creek and Furnace Branch/Creek in Anne Arundel County. Adjoining nearby to the east is Thoms Cove near Hawkins Point at the north end of the Marley Neck peninsula. Curtis Bay cove itself also has a dredged deep water channel with considerable port facilities and waterfront industries and is a branch of the main stem of the Patapsco River, which forms the extensive frontage of Baltimore Harbor and Port, northwest off of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nThe residential community of Curtis Bay is along three major north-south thoroughfares of Curtis Avenue, Pennington Avenue (Maryland Route 173 on which most commercial businesses are located) and residential Fairhaven Avenue and a partial street of Prudence Street. Running west to east are fifteen smaller residential streets named alphabetically for various types of trees. \n\"The Bay\", as it is often called colloquially, also offers a variety of housing, townhouses, rowhouses, individual homes, (both constructed of wood-frame, brick, stone and concrete block/stuccoed) and corner stores, taverns/bars.\n\nCurtis Bay is also home since 1897 to the United States Coast Guard Yard \n(formerly the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service until 1915) on Hawkins Point Road / extending south from Pennington Avenue (Maryland Route 173) on Arundel Cove off Curtis Creek on the border line with neighboring suburban Anne Arundel County to the south.\nDuring the middle and late 19th and early 20th centuries, a Quarantine Station and lazaretto run by the United States Government agency (future U.S. Public Health Service) along Thoms Cove between Sledds Point and Hawkins Point.\n\nThere is a large Polish American community in Curtis Bay. The former town hall, real estate office, volunteer fire station, and meeting/assembly hall on the second floor for Curtis Bay was constructed on the heights overlooking the new town and rapidly developing industrial waterfront along Fairview Avenue (now Fairhaven Avenue) facing Filbert Street by a successor developing firm, the South Baltimore Harbor and Improvement Company in 1905. In 1925, the United Polish Societies purchased the building and named it Polish Home Hall and it became central to the Polish ethnic experience in Curtis Bay, functioning as a social, educational, and political center for Curtis Bay's Polish community into the 1970s.\n\n\nAmerican Legion Post 187, est. 1947\n"}
{"id": "708195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=708195", "title": "Death certificate", "text": "Death certificate\n\nThe phrase death certificate can refer either to a document issued by a medical practitioner certifying the deceased state of a person or, popularly, to a document issued by a person such as a registrar of vital statistics that declares the date, location and cause of a person's death as later entered in an official register of deaths.\n\nEach governmental jurisdiction prescribes the form of the document for use in its preview and the procedures necessary to legally produce it. One purpose of the certificate is to review the cause of death to determine if foul-play occurred as it can rule out an accidental death or a murder going by the findings and ruling of the medical examiner. It may also be required in order to arrange a burial or cremation to provide prima facie evidence of the fact of death, which can be used to prove a person's will or to claim on a person's life insurance. Lastly, death certificates are used in public health to compile data on leading causes of death among other statistics (See: Descriptive statistics)\n\nBefore issuing a death certificate, the authorities usually require a certificate from a physician or coroner to validate the cause of death and the identity of the deceased. In cases where it is not completely clear that a person is dead (usually because their body is being sustained by life support), a neurologist is often called in to verify brain death and to fill out the appropriate documentation. The failure of a physician to immediately submit the required form to the government (to trigger issuance of the death certificate) is often both a crime and cause for loss of one's license to practice. This is because of past scandals in which dead people continued to receive public benefits or voted in elections.\nDeath certificates may also be issued pursuant to a court order or an executive order in the case of individuals who have been declared dead \"in absentia\". Missing persons and victims of mass disasters (such as the sinking of the \"RMS Lusitania\") may be issued death certificates in one of these manners.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, a police officer or a paramedic may be allowed to sign a death certificate under specific circumstances. This is usually when the cause of death seems obvious and no foul play is suspected, such as in extreme old age. In such cases, an autopsy is rarely performed. This varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; in some areas police officers may sign death certificates for victims of SIDS, but in others all deaths of individuals under 18 must be certified by a physician. Accident deaths where there is no chance of survival (decapitations, for instance) may be certified by police or paramedics, but autopsies are still commonly performed if there is any chance that alcohol or other drugs played a role in the accident.\n\nA full explanation of the cause of death includes four items:\n\nIn most of the United States, death certificates are considered public domain documents and can therefore be obtained for any individual regardless of the requester's relationship to the deceased. Other jurisdictions take a different view, and restrict the issue of certificates. For example, in the State of New York, death certificates are only obtainable by close relatives, including the spouse, parent, child or sibling of the deceased, and other persons who have a documented lawful right or claim, documented medical need, or a New York State Court Order.\n\nIn Europe and North America, death records were kept by the local churches, along with baptism and marriage records. In what would become the United States, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was the first to have the secular courts keep these records, in 1639. By the end of the 19th century, European countries were pursuing centralized systems for recording deaths.\n\nIn the United States, a standard model death certificate was developed around 1910. This promoted uniformity and consistency in record keeping.\n\nIn the United States, certificates issued to the general public for deaths after 1990 may in some states be redacted to erase the specific cause of death (in cases where death was from natural causes) to comply with HIV confidentiality rules. In New York State, for instance, the cause of death on a general death certificate is only specified if death was accidental, homicide, suicide, or declared in absentia; all other deaths are only referred to as natural. All states have provisions, however, whereby immediate family members, law enforcement agencies, and governmental authorities (such as occupational health and safety groups) are able to obtain death certificates containing the full cause of death, even in cases of natural death.\n\nIn some cases, such as the death of a minor or infant, certificates may be kept confidential from the public as requested by legal guardian and therefore cannot be obtained by the general public but rather through immediate family members.\n\nRegistration in the UK is organised separately in the constituent jurisdictions. A register of deaths contains the information supplied by an informant, nowadays usually containing and repeating the information given in a \"Medical Certificate of Death\" (MCOD) supplied by the medical practitioner who certifies that life is extinct, this being the real \"death certificate\" distinct from the \"registration of a death\" in a register. Further information might be added after the first registration if the death was the subject of an inquest (Northern Ireland or England and Wales) or a Fatal Accident Inquiry (Scotland); this can result in a later copy of a death registration giving more details of the cause of death or the associated circumstances.\n\nIn England and Wales, compulsory national registration of deaths began in 1837. Originally the death registration listed when and where a person died, their name and surname, the parent or parents (if the deceased was a child), sex, age, occupation, cause of death, the description and residence of the informant, when the death was registered and the registrar's signature. Further details have since been recorded including the deceased's date and place of birth, maiden surnames and other former surnames of women who have been divorced.\n\nBeginning in 1879, a doctor's certificate was necessary for the issuance of a death certificate (prior to that, no cause of death needed to be given).\n\nThe form of indexing and the layout of register pages generally follows that of England and Wales.\n\nNational registration began in 1855; registrations are rather more detailed than in England and Wales. In the first year of registration many more details than in later years were recorded including the children of the deceased with their ages, the deceased's birthplace and how long they were resident in the district where they died. The burial place was recorded from 1855 to 1860. Standard details have until now included the deceased's name, age, marital status, spouse(s) (if any), details of both parents, cause of death and the informant's description. Current (2011) registrations show the date of birth. The prescribed forms are part of secondary legislation and those for recent years can thus be seen online in the Statute Law Database.\n\nUnlike England and Wales, information is not limited to being supplied in the form of certified copies; original register pages (or filmed images) can be viewed in person at local register offices or at the General Register Office in Edinburgh, online (fees apply) on the Scotlands People website or in microfilms (1855-1875, 1881, 1891) available at family history centres operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nThese jurisdictions do not form part of the United Kingdom and each has its own registration system. Their older records tend to follow the layout used in England and Wales.\n\nStillbirths (beyond 24 weeks gestation) have been registered since 1927 in a register that is closed from public access. A single stillbirth registration takes the place of both birth and death registration for the stillborn infant. Prior to 1960 such certificates gave no cause of death.\n\nStillbirth certificates can only be ordered by the mother or father of the deceased contacting the General Register Office by phone or letter. In the event of the parents both having died, an adult sibling can order the certificate if they can provide the dates of death for both parents.\n\nRegistration of still-births commenced in 1939. The registers are not open to public view and extracts are only issued \"in exceptional circumstances\".\n\nA 2007 article in \"People\" magazine revealed that in the case of a stillbirth it is not standard practice to issue both a birth certificate and a death certificate. Most states instead issue a \"certificate of birth resulting in stillbirth\".\n\n\n"}

This exceeds the rate of growth for the United States as a whole. The growth comprises a natural increase since the last census of 412,906 people (that is 1,015,065 births minus 602,159 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 783,382 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 192,099 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 591,283 people. Between 2005 and 2006, North Carolina passed New Jersey to become the 10th most populous state. The state's population reported as under 5 years old was 6.7%, 24.4% were under 18, and 12.0% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 51% of the population.\n\nNorth Carolina has three major Metropolitan Combined Statistical Areas with populations of more than 1 million (U.S. Census Bureau 2010 estimates):\n\nNorth Carolina has nine municipalities with populations of more than 100,000, with 16 municipalities with populations over 50,000 (U.S. Census Bureau 2010 figures):\n\nOfficially, as drawn from verified US Census Department Statistics, the 15 largest cities in North Carolina are:<br>\n1 Charlotte: \"Mecklenburg County\" - population 731,424<br>\n2 Raleigh: \"Wake County\" - population 403,892<br>\n3 Greensboro: \"Guilford County\" - population 269,666<br>\n4 Durham: \"Durham County\" - population 256,330<br>\n5 Winston-Salem: \"Forsyth County\" - population 233,123<br>\n6 Fayetteville: \"Cumberland County\" - population 200,564<br>\n7 Cary: \"Wake County\" - population 135,234<br>\n8 Wilmington: \"New Hanover County\" - population 106,476<br>\n9 High Point: \"Guilford County\" - population 104,371<br>\n10 Greenville: \"Pitt County\" - population 86,017<br>\n11 Asheville: \"Buncombe County\" - population 83,393<br>\n12 Concord: \"Cabarrus County\" - population 79,066<br>\n13 Gastonia: \"Gaston County\" - population 71,059<br>\n14 Jacksonville: \"Onslow County\" - population 70,145<br>\n15 Chapel Hill: \"Durham\" and \"Orange Counties\" - population 57,477\n\nThese figures may have been invalidated by local estimates, chamber of commerce estimates, or other unofficial sources.\n\n\"Note: Births in table don't add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\"\n\nAs of the 2015 vintage year of the U.S. Census series starting in 2010, the U.S. Census estimated that the racial distribution of North Carolina's population was 71.2% White American, 22.1% African American, 1.6% American Indian, 2.8% Asian, and 9.1% Hispanic or Latino (of any race. North Carolina has historically been a rural state, with most of the population living on farms or in small towns. However, over the last 30 years the state has undergone rapid urbanization, and today most of North Carolina's residents live in urban and suburban areas, as is the case in most of the United States. In particular, the cities of Charlotte and Raleigh have become major urban centers, with large, diverse, mainly affluent and rapidly growing populations. Most of this growth in diversity has been fueled by immigrants from Latin America, India, and Southeast Asia.\n\nIn addition, large numbers of people from the Northeastern United States, Florida and California have moved to the state in recent years. North Carolina was one of the country's fastest growing states in the 1980s and 1990s. The growth rate subsided in the first decade of the 21st century due to changed economic conditions, but it continued to attract new residents. \n\nThe center of population of North Carolina is located in Randolph County, in the town of Seagrove.\n\nAfrican Americans make up nearly a quarter of North Carolina's population. The number of middle-class blacks has increased since the 1970s. African Americans are concentrated in the state's eastern Coastal Plain and in parts of the Piedmont Plateau, where they had historically worked and where the most new job opportunities are. African-American communities number by the hundreds in rural counties in the south-central and northeast, and in predominantly black neighborhoods in the cities: Charlotte, Raleigh, Durham, Greensboro, Fayetteville, Wilmington and Winston-Salem.\n\nUntil the mid-1820s, North Carolina had more small farms and fewer plantations than adjacent South Carolina and Virginia. These \"yeoman\" farmers were non-slave-holding (or owning few slaves), private land owners of tracts of approximately 500 acres (2 km²) or less. Relatively few blacks live in the state's mountains and rural areas of the western Piedmont. In some mountain counties, the black population has historically numbered in the few dozens at most.\n\nFree African Americans migrated in the colonial and post-Revolutionary period to frontier areas of North Carolina from Virginia. Detailed family histories of 80% of those counted as \"all other free persons\" in the 1790-1810 federal census show they were descendants of African Americans free in Virginia during the colonial period. As boundaries were then more permeable, most free African families descended from unions between white women, free or servant, and African men, free, servant or slave. Indians who adopted English customs became part of free African American communities and married into the families. Some of the lighter-skinned descendants formed their own distinct communities, often identifying themselves as Indian or Portuguese to escape effects of the color line.\n\nThe state has a rapidly growing proportion of Asian Americans, specifically Indian and Vietnamese; these groups nearly quintupled and tripled, respectively, between 1990 and 2002, as people arrived in the state for new jobs in the growing economy. Recent estimates suggest that the state's Asian-American population has increased significantly since 2000. Indian Americans are one of the most highly educated groups in the US.\n\nNorth Carolina has the largest population of Montagnards, perhaps 10,000, living in the US. These refugees originate from the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The first group arrived in 1986 as former fighters allied with US Special Forces during the Vietnam War. Today, most of the population lives in Charlotte, Raleigh and especially, Greensboro. Until the 2010 Census, their number has never been accurately identified or counted.\n\nEvents during the 1980s in Laos spurred Hmong immigration to North Carolina, as refugees fled wars and communist rule. They now number 12,000 in the state. A small Hmong farming colony can be found near Marion.\n\nThe earliest record of Asian immigration to North Carolina goes back to the mid-19th century when the first Chinese were hired as miners and agricultural workers. The famous Thai \"Siamese\" twins - Eng and Chang Bunker - conjoined together at their chests, settled in Mt Airy, North Carolina in 1839. Smaller numbers of Japanese, Filipinos, and Koreans arrived to work as farmers, but many also worked in the Atlantic fishing industries in the early and mid-20th century.\n\nSettled first, the coastal region attracted primarily English immigrants of the early migrations, including indentured servants transported to the colonies and descendants of English who migrated from Virginia. In addition, there were waves of Protestant European immigration, including the British, Irish, French Huguenots, and Swiss Germans who settled New Bern. A concentration of Welsh (usually included with others from Britain and Ireland) settled east of present Fayetteville in the 18th century. For a long time the wealthier, educated planters of the coastal region dominated state government.\n\nNorth Carolinians of Scots-Irish, Scottish and English ancestry are spread across the state. Historically Scots–Irish and Northern English settled mostly in the Piedmont and backcountry. They were the last and most numerous of the immigrant groups from the Britain and Ireland before the Revolution, and settled throughout the Appalachian South, where they could continue their own culture. They were fiercely independent and mostly yeoman farmers.\n\nIn the Winston-Salem area, there is a substantial population of ethnic German ancestry (from the modern area of the Czech Republic), descended from immigration of members of the Protestant Moravian Church during the mid-18th century. The Moravians of Winston-Salem are not primarily of Czech ancestry, but mostly of German descent, and members of the Moravian Church in America, a Protestant denomination takes its name from a spiritual movement that began in 15th century Moravia and nearby Bohemia. North Carolina is home to more than 10,000 Bosnian Americans. The Greeks have been around since the early 20th century with 7 Greek Orthodox churches in NC. During the early 20th century, a small group of Orthodox immigrants from Ukraine settled in Pender County.\n\nThere is somewhat of a long history of Portuguese settlement along the state's Atlantic coast whose families were fishermen originated from the Azores islands and the country of Portugal, and there are over 50,000 residents of Portuguese descent. Also the North Carolina coast attracted Basque fishermen from their homeland in Northern Spain and southwest France. The seasonal residents known as \"snowbirds\" the majority are Canadians either English and French speaking live in coastal sections and beach towns every winter.\n\nSince 1990 the state has seen an increase in the number of Hispanics/Latinos. Once chiefly employed as migrant labor, Hispanic residents of the 1990s and early 21st century have been attracted to low-skilled jobs that are the first step on the economic ladder. As a result, growing numbers of Hispanic immigrants are settling in the state, majority of which is from Mexico, but also from Puerto Rico, and to a lesser degree from other Caribbean and Central American countries. There are also significant amounts of Hispanics moving to North Carolina from other states, such as Puerto Ricans from the Northeast. In Hispanic neighborhoods such as Eastland in Charlotte, Mexican Americans have become the ethnic majority. Newly formed \"barrios\" in the Raleigh area continue a transplanted Latin American culture. In 2005, the Pew Hispanic Center estimated that 300,000 — roughly 65 percent of North Carolina's Latino population — are undocumented immigrants, based on the Census Bureau's population estimates. The population has grown from 77,726 in 1990 to 517,617 in 2005, an average increase of 13.5% per year.\n\nNorth Carolina has the highest American Indian population in the East Coast. The estimated population figures for Native Americans in North Carolina (as of 2004) is 110,198. To date, North Carolina recognizes eight Native American tribal nations within its state borders:\n\nFurthermore, though they are not state-recognized, Robeson County has a significant number of descendants of the Tuscarora, who are currently attempting to gain state recognition.\nOnly five states: (California, Arizona, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas), have larger Native American populations than North Carolina. The total Native American and Alaska Native population in the United States is 2,824,751, or 0.95% of the total.\n\nAs of 2010, 89.66% (7,750,904) of North Carolina residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 6.93% (598,756) spoke Spanish, 0.32% (27,310) French, 0.27% (23,204) German, and Chinese (which includes Mandarin) was spoken as a main language by 0.27% (23,072) of the population over the age of five. In total, 10.34% (893,735) of North Carolina's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.\n\nNorth Carolina, like other Southern states, has traditionally been overwhelmingly Protestant. By the late 19th century, the largest Protestant denomination was the Southern Baptists. However, the rapid influx of northerners and immigrants from Latin America is steadily increasing the number of Roman Catholics and Jews in the state. The Baptists remain the single largest church in the state, however.\n\nThe growing diversity of religious groups in North Carolina is most visible in the state's larger urban areas, such as Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham. It is in these cities and suburbs that most of the state's new immigrants and residents have settled. However, in many rural counties the Southern Baptists remain the dominant Christian church. The second-largest Protestant church in North Carolina are the Methodists, who are strong in the northern Piedmont, and especially in populous Guilford County. There are also substantial numbers of Quakers in Guilford County, and northeastern North Carolina.\n\nThe Presbyterians, historically Scots-Irish, have had a strong presence in Charlotte, the state's largest city, and in Scotland County.\n\nJews began arriving in North Carolina in the early to mid-19th century. Primarily German Jews, these early merchants established centers in the coastal cities of Wilmington and New Bern. It was not until the late 19th to early 20th century, however, that Eastern European Jews began to arrive in large numbers to Piedmont cities such as Charlotte and Greensboro. Today, most Jewish communities in North Carolina are centered around large Piedmont cities such as Charlotte, Raleigh, Greensboro, and Winston-Salem. In recent years, Western North Carolina has also seen an influx of Jews, who have relocated to places such as Asheville and Boone from Florida and the Northeast. It is estimated there are approximately 30,000 Jewish residents in North Carolina, which constitute around 0.3% of the state's population.\n\nThe religious affiliations of the people of North Carolina, as of 2001, are shown below:\n\n"}
{"id": "8864225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8864225", "title": "Discovery doctrine", "text": "Discovery doctrine\n\nThe Discovery doctrine is a concept of public international law expounded by the United States Supreme Court in a series of decisions, most notably \"Johnson v. M'Intosh\" in 1823. Chief Justice John Marshall explained and applied the way that colonial powers laid claim to lands belonging to foreign sovereign nations during the Age of Discovery. Under it, title to lands lay with the government whose subjects travelled to and occupied a territory whose inhabitants were not subjects of a European Christian monarch. The doctrine has been primarily used to support decisions invalidating or ignoring aboriginal possession of land in favor of colonial or post-colonial governments.\n\nThe 1823 case was the result of collusive lawsuits where land speculators worked together to make claims to achieve a desired result. John Marshall explained the Court's reasoning. The decision has been the subject of a number of law review articles and has come under increased scrutiny by modern legal theorists.\n\nThe Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by indigenous peoples under the guise of discovery. In 1494, the Treaty of Tordesillas declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Discovery Doctrine.\n\nIn 1792, U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson declared that the Doctrine of the Discovery would extend from Europe to the infant U.S. government. The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence American imperialism and treatment of indigenous peoples.\n\nThe plaintiff Johnson had inherited land, originally purchased from the Piankeshaw tribes. Defendant McIntosh claimed the same land, having purchased it under a grant from the United States. It appears that in 1775 members of the Piankeshaw tribe sold certain land in the Indiana Territory to Lord Dunmore, royal governor of Virginia and others. In 1805 the Piankeshaw conveyed much of the same land to William Henry Harrison, governor of the Indiana Territory, thus giving rise to conflicting claims of title. In reviewing whether the courts of the United States should recognize land titles obtained from Native Americans prior to American independence, the court decided that they should not. Chief Justice John Marshall had large real estate holdings that would have been affected if the case were decided in favor of Johnson. Rather than remove himself from the case, however, the chief justice wrote the decision for a unanimous US Supreme Court.\n\nMarshall found that ownership of land comes into existence by virtue of discovery of that land, a rule that had been observed by all European countries with settlements in the New World. Legally, the United States was the true owner of the land because it inherited that ownership from Britain, the original discoverer.\n\nMarshall noted:\nOn the discovery of this immense continent, the great nations of Europe ... as they were all in pursuit of nearly the same object, it was necessary, in order to avoid conflicting settlements, and consequent war with each other, to establish a principle which all should acknowledge as the law by which the right of acquisition, which they all asserted, should be regulated as between themselves. This principle was that discovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession. ... The history of America, from its discovery to the present day, proves, we think, the universal recognition of these principles. \n\nChief Justice Marshall noted the 1455 papal bull Romanus Pontifex approved Portugal's claims to lands discovered along the coast of West Africa, and the 1493 Inter Caetera had ratified Spain's right to conquer newly found lands, after Christopher Columbus had already begun doing so, but stated:\n\"Spain did not rest her title solely on the grant of the Pope. Her discussions respecting boundary, with France, with Great Britain, and with the United States, all show that she placed it on the rights given by discovery. Portugal sustained her claim to the by the same title.\"\n\nMarshall pointed to the exploration charters given to John Cabot as proof that the British had operated under the doctrine. The tribes which occupied the land were, at the moment of discovery, no longer completely sovereign and had no property rights but rather merely held a right of occupancy. Further, only the discovering nation or its successor could take possession of the land from the natives by conquest or purchase.\n\nThe doctrine was cited in other cases as well. With \"Cherokee Nation v. Georgia\", it supported the concept that tribes were not independent states but \"domestic dependent nations\". The decisions in \"Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe\" and \"Duro v. Reina\" used the doctrine to prohibit tribes from criminally prosecuting first non-Indians, then Indians who were not a member of the prosecuting tribe.\n\nThe doctrine has been cited by the US Supreme Court as recently as 2005, in City of Sherrill, NY v. Oneida Nation: \"Under the 'doctrine of discovery...' fee title (ownership) to the lands occupied by Indians when the colonists arrived became vested in the sovereign-first the discovering European nation and later the original states and the United States.\"\n\nThe Doctrine of Discovery was promulgated by European monarchies in order to legitimize the colonization of lands outside of Europe. Between the mid-fifteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, this idea allowed European entities to seize lands inhabited by indigenous peoples under the guise of discovery. In 1494, the Treaty of Tordesillas declared that only non-Christian lands could be colonized under the Discovery Doctrine.\n\nIn 1792, U.S. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson declared that the Doctrine of the Discovery would extend from Europe to the infant U.S. government. The Doctrine and its legacy continue to influence American imperialism and treatment of indigenous peoples.\n\nAs the Piankeshaw were not party to the litigation, \"no Indian voices were heard in a case which had, and continues to have, profound effects on Indian property rights.\"\n\nProfessor Blake A. Watson of the University of Dayton School of Law finds Marshall's claim of \"universal recognition\" of the \"doctrine of discovery\" historically inaccurate.\n\nIn reviewing the history of European exploration Marshall did not take note of Spanish Dominican philosopher Francisco de Vitoria's 1532 \"De Indis\" nor \"De Jure belli Hispanorum in barbaros\". Vitoria adopted from Thomas Aquinas the Roman law concept of \"ius gentium\", and concluded that the Indians were rightful owners of their property and that their chiefs validly exercised jurisdiction over their tribes, a position held previously by Palacios Rubios. His defense of American Indians was based on a scholastic understanding of the intrinsic dignity of man, a dignity he found being violated by Spain's policies in the New World.\n\nMarshall also overlooked more recent American experience, specifically Roger Williams's purchase of the Providence Plantation. In order to forestall Massachusetts and Plymouth designs on the land, Williams subsequently traveled to England to obtain a patent which referenced the purchase from the natives. The Royal Charter of Rhode Island issued by Charles II acknowledged the rights of the Indians to the land.\n\nNor does Justice Marshall seem to have taken note of the policy of the Dutch West India Company which only conferred ownership rights in New Netherland after the grantee had acquired title by purchase from the Indian owners, a practice also followed by the Quakers in Pennsylvania.\n\nWatson and others, such as Robert Williams Jr. suggest that Marshall misinterpreted the \"discovery doctrine\" as giving exclusive right to lands discovered, rather than the exclusive right to treaty with the inhabitants thereof.\n\nDiscovery doctrine has been severely condemned as socially unjust, racist, and in violation of basic and fundamental human rights. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues noted Discovery doctrine \"as the foundation of the violation of their (Indigenous people) human rights\".\n\nIn 2012, the United Nations Economic and Social Council Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues called for a mechanism to investigate historical land claims.\n\nDuring the General Convention of the Episcopal Church conducted on 8–17 August 2009, the bishops of the church adopted a resolution officially repudiating the discovery doctrine.\n\nAt the 2012 Unitarian Universalist Association General Assembly in Phoenix, AZ, delegates of the Unitarian Universalist Association passed a resolution repudiating the Doctrine of Discovery and calling on Unitarian Universalists to study the Doctrine and eliminate its presence from the current-day policies, programs, theologies, and structures of Unitarian Universalism. In 2013, at its 29th General Synod, the United Church of Christ followed suit in repudiating the doctrine in a near-unanimous vote.\n\nAt the 2016 Synod, 10-17 June in Grand Rapids, MI, delegates to the annual general assembly of the Christian Reformed Church rejected the Doctrine of Discovery as heresy in response to a study report on the topic.\n\nAlso in 2016, on November 3, a group of 500 clergy members publicly denounced the Doctrine of Discovery at the Standing Rock pipeline protests.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26562716", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26562716", "title": "Dixie", "text": "Dixie\n\nDixie (otherwise known as Dixieland) is a nickname for the Southern United States, especially those states that composed the Confederate States of America. The term originally referred simply to the states south of the Mason–Dixon line, but now is more of a cultural reference, referring to parts of the United States that \"feel\" southern. \n\nAs a definite geographic location within the United States, \"Dixie\" is usually defined as the eleven Southern states that seceded in late 1860 and early 1861 to form the new Confederate States of America. They are (in order of secession): South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee. Maryland never seceded from the Union, but many of their citizens favored the Confederacy. Whilst many of Maryland’s representatives were arrested to prevent secession, both the states of Missouri and Kentucky produced Ordinances of Secession and were admitted into the Confederacy. Note that West Virginia was part of Virginia until 1863; counties that chose not to secede from the Union became part of West Virginia.\n\nAlthough Maryland is not included in Dixie today, Maryland is on the Dixie side of the Mason–Dixon line; if the origin of the term Dixie is accepted as referring to the region south (and west) of that line, Maryland was in Dixie in 1760. It can also be argued that Maryland was, in 1860, part of Dixie, especially culturally. In this sense, it would remain so into the 1970s, when an influx of people from the Northeast made the state and its culture significantly less Southern (especially Baltimore and the suburbs of Washington DC).\n\nHowever, the location and boundaries of \"Dixie\" have, over time, become increasingly subjective and mercurial. Today, it is most often associated with those parts of the Southern United States where traditions and legacies of the Confederate era and the antebellum South live most strongly. The concept of \"Dixie\" as the location of a certain set of cultural assumptions, mind-sets and traditions (along with those of other regions in North America) was explored in the 1981 book \"The Nine Nations of North America\".\n\nIn terms of self-identification and appeal the popularity of the word “Dixie” seems to be declining. A 1976 study revealed that on some 350,000 sq. miles “Dixie” reached 25% popularity of “American” in names of commercial business entities. Though a 1999 analysis provided confusing evidence, a 2010 study conclusively demonstrated that in course of 40 years the area in question shrunk to just 40,000 sq. miles, to the territory at the confluence of Louisiana, Mississipi, Alabama and Florida. In 1976 at some 600,000 sq. miles “Dixie” reached at least 6% popularity of “American”; in 2010 the corresponding area was some 500,000 sq. miles.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the origin of this nickname remains obscure. The most common theories according to \"A Dictionary of Americanisms on Historical Principles\" (1951) by Mitford M. Mathews:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2810536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2810536", "title": "Drunken Bakers", "text": "Drunken Bakers\n\nThe Drunken Bakers is a strip cartoon in the British adult humour magazine \"Viz\" created by Barney Farmer and Lee Healey. It depicts the alcohol-dominated lives of two forlorn bakers who attempt to run a small bakery. The strip was adapted into a video-art installation piece by the artist Mark Leckey in 2006.\n\nThe strip has been compared to the work of Samuel Beckett. Its nihilistic aspects have impressed critics. Roberta Smith, in \"The New York Times\" said \"The aesthetic compression of Mr Farmer's dialogue and Mr Healey's line...convey an oppressive sense of the drinker's irresistible drive for oblivion.\"\n\nThe two bakers run (or at least attempt to run) a bakery together. Their names have never been mentioned; one has sparse black hair, the other has a bulbous nose and large phiz of fair (possibly blond) hair. They are drawn as - and have the personalities of - a pair of classic clown archetypes, an odd couple: the curly haired but balding one being short and aggressive, the taller being doleful. In one episode, they were drawn as wearing suits that were for the curly-haired one much too small, and for the taller one much too big - another classic clown type. According to Roberta Smith, the characters are \"two middle-aged Bumstead-like alcoholics haplessly lurching from one disaster and one drink to the next as they attempt to run a bakery.\"\n\nBoth bakers suffer from severe alcoholism, and every strip shows them drinking strong alcoholic beverages such as various liqueurs. Their idea of a Wednesday half-closing is to sit on a public seat in front of a local off-licence, enjoying the 'view'. The black-haired one has an estranged daughter as his wife left him on Christmas Eve. Occasionally the curly haired one will remind him of this, usually due to the black haired one offending the curly haired one. They try their best to bake something every night, but because of their inebriation, the results are always hopeless. As critic Steve Lowe says,\n\nIf they even manage to bake something, it is often inedible, sometimes even toxic. For instance in one episode they baked cakes made with paraffin instead of milk - \"This milk is blue and it tastes funny\". The only exception to this is the 25 anniversary of the opening of the bakery, when the black-haired one decides to bake twin cakes in the form of the number 25. He succeeds, producing the number 25 in cake form, while his partner drinks mulled wine made in the kettle, which has held something nasty. In the final frame the inevitable happens - the fellow vomits up his stomach contents all over the anniversary cakes, and so their only success is utterly ruined.\n\nCustomers sometimes arrive at the baker's shop, asking for various breads or pastries, at Christmas, a whole lot of Christmas cakes, and once even a five-tiered wedding cake. The bakers promise they'll bake it for them, but always fail to fulfil their promise. Recent strips have featured one of the protagonists being hospitalised with renal failure while the other drinks rum at his bedside. Their shop, which is almost perpetually empty of produce, especially the front window, has been vandalised many times, and has burnt down several times, generally due to them leaving the oven on and falling into a drunken stupor.\n\nThe strip is fatalistic; the bakers will never reform, their customers will never get proper service, and nobody is doing a thing about it. Nevertheless, they carry on. As art critic Emily Mears remarks, \"somehow, with the remarkable fortitude of true career drunks and in a rather sweet depiction of brotherly love, they prop each other up and return, strip after strip, to bake again.\" Some storylines fail to resolve themselves and end indeterminately, reinforcing the character's cyclical and depressing existence. In one strip, one of the bakers is bitten by a stray dog he has befriended, but he doesn't notice. \"Your mouth is pissing blood\" remarks the other baker.\n\nWhereas most of the comics in \"Viz\" have traditional hand-lettered captions and dialogue, the Drunken Bakers strip instalments (and other, less regular strips by Farmer & Healey) have typeset speech balloons. This gives Farmer & Healey's work a significantly different appearance from other \"Viz\" material.\n\nIn 2006 The Drunken Bakers were the subject of an exhibition by Mark Leckey at the Tate Britain. Leckey created a film using frames from the original strips to construct a narrative and added a soundtrack spoken by himself and his colleague Steve Claydon in Liverpudlian accents. According to Emily Mears,\n\nIn Roberta Smith's words, Leckey constructs \"dreamy, druggy, disjointed variants on music videos...He has ingeniously filmed the comic strip with close-ups and jump-cuts, creating a kind of stop-action animation, and added a skillfully explicit soundtrack replete with convincing belches, slurps, breaking glass and vomiting.\" Smith says that Leckey's artwork is less an original work than an \"adaptation or an homage\" of the original cartoon.\n\nLecky also created models of the bakers, exhibited as \"Drunken Bakers Dozen\" in 2007.\n\nThe strip and the Tate Britain exhibition have received wide critical acclaim from both the art and literary worlds. Alan Moore has said, \"I think the Drunken Bakers is like Samuel fucking Beckett or something. It's horrible and really funny.\" Steve Lowe in \"The Guardian\" says that \"Comedy drunks have been around since drinks first began, but few have been so utterly forlorn as the Drunken Bakers.\" Christopher Howse compares it to the animated sketch show \"Monkey Dust\", describing \"another episode of 'Drunken Bakers', in which one alcoholic baker succumbs to internal bleeding to the complete indifference of his drinking companion. It's brilliant.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "6545589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6545589", "title": "Hermetism and other religions", "text": "Hermetism and other religions\n\nThis is a comparative religion article which outlines the similarities and interactions between Hermeticism (or Hermetism) and other religions or philosophies.\n\nChristianity and Hermetism have interacted in such a way that controversy surrounds the nature of the influence. Some, such as Richard August Reitzenstein believed that Hermetism had heavily influenced Christianity; while others, such as Marie-Joseph LaGrange, believed that Christianity heavily influenced Hermetism; most see the exchange as more mutual. Both religions hold redemption, revelation and focus on the knowledge of God as the meaning of humanity's existence. This knowledge of God comes upon a mystical experience dependent upon rebirth, the focal point of arguments for influence from one of these religions upon the other. The focus of this rebirth are the words \"Life,\" \"Light,\" and \"Truth\" as well as a moral attitude of the seeker in his attainment of higher knowledge. Both also share a dualistic philosophy which comes from a shared philosophical background in popular schools of Hellenistic thought. Early Christianity and Hermetism both are esoteric without having an excessive emphasis on secrecy, relying upon inward experience, assisted by instruction and ultimately the result of revelation by God. Former president of the American Academy of Religion, Catherine L Albanese, has theorized that Hermetic thought has had a profound influence in Mormonism, Unitarianism, Universalism, and the Shakers. In \"Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century\", Lutheran Bishop James Heiser evaluated the writings of Marsilio Ficino and Giovanni Pico della Mirandola as contributions to a “Hermetic Reformation.\"\n\nThe \"Fourth Gospel\", or \"Gospel of John\", is purported to have similarities with the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" in religious thought and religious questing. There are also, however, deep differences as well.\n\nBoth texts utilize the concept of Logos and emphasize that the followers of their respective religions are apart from the rest of the world, suitable for only a few followers. Each of the two texts stress the importance of redemption, revelation, and rebirth to find knowledge of God and contain striking similarity in the wording of how moral attitudes promote higher knowledge in general. Opposed to the basis of the contemporary mystery cults, both texts relayed that the core of religious practice should be done internally through the personal experience of the believer rather than externally through sacramental ritual. Dualism plays a strong part in each of the two works.\n\nMary Lyman also points out four distinct contrasts between the two works despite their similarities. First, that the \"Fourth Gospel\" is a homogeneous work while the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" is a work which is found in fragments which she suspects were written by many authors over a wide range of time. Second, cosmic speculation is paramount to the Hermetic work while the fourth Gospel focuses on issues of religion. Third, the Hermetic text focuses on the asceticism of the day while the Fourth Gospel ignores it completely. Fourth, the Gospel's figures are all unique and grounds itself in the life of Jesus of Nazareth while the Hermetic text uses an \"elusive literary tradition\" which does little to identify or separate its characters. Though she relays that a scholar named Angus believed that the two would be more similar if they had the same proportion of Hermetic writings as Christian writings.\n\nA theory by John L. Brooke, an author and professor at Tufts University, suggests that Mormonism has its roots in Hermetism and Hermeticism after following a philosophical trail from Renaissance Europe. The early Mormons, most notably Joseph Smith, were linked with magic, alchemy, Freemasonry, divining and \"other elements of radical religion\" prior to Mormonism. Brooke attests correlations with the view that spirit and matter are one and the same, the covenant of celestial marriage, and the ability of humanity to become deified or ultimately perfect.\n\nFurther, Brooke argues that Mormonism can only be understood in conjunction with the occult and the Reformation-era sectarian idea of restoration. He sees ties to Hermeticism in Mormon support for Pelagianism, communitarianism, polygamy and Dispensationalism. He does however digress that there was a change since the 1860s in the LDS Church which has widely removed Hermetic influence. Catherine L Albanese picked up on Brooke's work and further claims that Smith's heavenly realm is derived from Emanuel Swedenborg's Divine Man and Hermeticism in general, linking it in with several American Christian movements which move Christianity in odd directions.\n\nHowever, scholars at the LDS-owned Brigham Young University have denounced Brooke's work and even scolded the publisher, Cambridge University Press, for printing it. Philip I Barlow criticizes the work as carelessly seeking out relations to Hermeticism which Brooke knows better than Mormonism, and believes that Brooke's links to Hermeticism can be explained away with \"a particular and selectively literal reading of the Bible.\" Albanese was criticised by Richard J Neuhaus as having denied Christianity the metaphysical in order to minimize its influence and that she is avoiding theology by calling her book a cultural history. Albanese believes that the metaphysical denial in scholarly research is due to its strong feminist qualities. Neuhaus believes American Christianity is more Gnostic in nature than Hermetic.\n\nAlbanese portends that several Christian denominations were affected by Hermeticism. The Shakers had been influenced in their belief of a dual God, being both male and female: Heavenly Father and Holy Mother Wisdom. She claims that Universalism was a clear mix of Christianity and Hermeticism where they come together, much like Rosicrucianism.\n\nHermeticism is closely related to Gnosticism. Both flourished in the same period in Alexandria, in the same spiritual climate, sharing the goal of the soul escaping from the material realm through true understanding, and emphasizing personal knowledge of God. Both were part of the third pillar of Western culture; representing the balance between Greek rationality and biblical faith along with the Cathars. Both groups saw the fundamental relationship between God and man was found through gnosis in a goal to \"see\" God and in some instances become one with God.\n\nChristian Gnostics, however, felt that there was something seriously wrong with \"Nous\", a part of The All; to them, it seemed that the concept could be stretched so far as to say that by bringing the world into existence, God had to remove himself from it at the same time. They also differed on the basis of theology, cosmology, and anthropology. Though both agreed in God's transcendence over the Universe, Hermetists believed that God could still be comprehended through philosophical reasoning, in agreement with philosophers and Christian theologians, but Gnostics felt God was completely unknowable. While the Gnostics indulged in mythological references often, Hermetic texts are generally void of mythology, with \"Poimandres\" as an exception. Hermetism is optimistic about God, while many forms of Christian Gnosticism are pessimistic about the creator (a different being from their conception of God): Several Christian Gnostic sects saw the Cosmos were the product of an evil creator and thus evil itself, while Hermetists saw the Cosmos as a beautiful creation in the image of God. Both view that mankind was originally divine and has become entrapped in the material world, a slave to passion and distracted from divine nature. However, the Gnostics often held a pessimistic view of mankind as a result while the Hermetic belief is generally positive towards mankind just the same. Rather, Hermetists believed that the human body was not bad in itself, but materialistic impulses such as sexual desire were the cause of \"evil\" in the world.\n\nIn 830 CE, a group of Hermetic pagans in Harran needed protection by being either Muslim, Christian, Jewish, or Sabian. They took the Corpus Hermeticum as their scripture and Hermes Trismegistus as their prophet, and decided to call themselves Sabians. As no one was sure what the Qur'an meant by Sabian, they were accepted as being such having a monotheistic scripture and a prophet. This group played a large role in Baghdad's intellectual life from 856-1050.\n\nThe most famous of the Harranian Sabians was Thabit ibn Qurra, who made great advances in alchemy, astronomy, and mathematics, citing his paganism as the reason for his ability. The author Antoine Faivre theorizes that Hermes Trismegistus is mentioned in the Qu'ran as well, under the name of Idris. (19:56, 19:57) Idris is also identified with Enoch, who is also identified with Hermes. He is called \"Thrice Wise,\" relating to Hermes' title \"Thrice Great.\"\n\nKhalid ibn Yazid was an Umayyad prince, who took an interest in alchemy early in Islamic history. The works of Jabir ibn Hayyan would be heavily influenced by Hermetic philosophy, as would Ismaili beliefs and theology.\n\nThe relationship between Judaism and Hermetism has been one of mutual influence and a subject of controversy within the Jewish religion.\n\nThis identification paved the way for the exchange and melding of ideas between Judaism and Hermetism during the Middle Ages. The most prominent interrelation between the two systems is in the development of Kabbalah which developed into three separate brands: a Jewish stream, a Christian stream (\"Cabala\" in Christianity), and a Hermetic stream (\"Qabalah\" in Hermeticism). Medieval Hermetism, aside from alchemy, is often seen as analogous to and was heavily influenced by these Kabbalistic ideas.\n\nHermetism and Kabbalah arose together in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Practical Kabbalah also relied upon magic and astrology but focused more on the Hebrew language in its incantations than the general language of Hermetism in general.\n\nSecondly, Jewish scholars of the Middle Ages attempted to make use of treatises on astrology, medicine and theurgy as a justification for practicing natural magic forbidden by a number of commandments in the Torah and reinforced by prophetic books codified by rabbinic authorities. They noted the wonders performed by celebrated biblical figures such as the patriarchs and King Solomon and which were seen as a God-given and condoned use of natural magic. They attributed these arts to divine knowledge imparted by Jewish heroes to gentiles such as the Indians, Babylonians, Egyptians, and Greeks, and felt that by approaching magic from a religious standpoint would legitimize their use of the sciences. In particular, they believed the Hermetic teachings to have its origins in ancient Jewish sources.\n\nThese Jewish scholars, particularly the ones who distrusted Aristotelian rationality, looked to Hermetism as a backing to discuss theological interpretation of the Torah and the ten commandments. Fabrizo Lelli writes: \"As for Christians and Muslims, so likewise for Jews, Hermetism was an alternative to Aristotelianism--the likeliest prospect, in fact, for integrating an alien system into their religion. This was because the response of the Hermetica to intellectual problems was generally theosophical.\"\n\nIn the use of these Hermetic treatises, these Jewish scholars, though at times inadvertently, introduced Hermetic ideas into Jewish thought. Shabbetay Donnolo's 10th century commentary on the \"Sefer Yezirah\" shows Hermetic influence, as well as the 13th century texts later compiled into the \"Sefer ha-Zohar\", and in the contemporary Kabbalistic works of Abraham Abulafia as well as of other Jewish thinkers influenced by Kabbalah such as Isaac Abravanel who used Hermetic Qabalah to affirm the superiority of Judaism. Lelli suggests that it was natural for these Jewish Kabbalists to elevate Hermetic teachings to a major role in Jewish thought in a time when they began to produce their own \"antirationalist--exegesis of scripture.\" This was despite the fact that many Hermetic works were ascribed to Aristotle in the time through pseudepigrapha; these scholars saw that as a justification to give the same elevated authority to the medical, astronomical, and magical Hermetic texts.\n\nHowever, most Medieval Jewish scholars aware of the Hermetic tradition did not mention Hermetism explicitly, but rather referred to them through Hermetic ideas that were borrowed from Islam or brought Hermeticism up only to reject it. While scholars such as Moses ibn Ezra, Bahya ibn Paquda, Judah ha-Levi, and Abraham ibn Ezra specifically brought up Hermeticism to integrate into their philosophies, others such as Moses ben Maimon (Maimonides) specifically rejected anything Hermetic as being responsible for counterparadigmic views of God. Maimonides warned his readers against what he viewed as the degenerative effect of Hermetic ideas, particularly those of the Sabians, and was effective in persuading many Jewish thinkers away from Hermetic integration, known as Hebrew Hermetism.\n\nScholars, such as Abraham ibn Ezra, felt justified in invoking the authority of Hermes to offer esoteric explanations of Jewish ritual. This culminated in a wide use of Hermetic texts for the use of theurgy and talisman construction. The Jewish version of the theurgic practice of drawing divine spirits down to Earth was horadat haruhaniyut, \"the lowering of spirituality.\" Books such as the \"Sefer Mafteah Shlomoh\", \"Sefer Meleket Muskelet\", \"Sefer ha-Tamar\" and \"Sefer Hermes\". The Hermetic texts most valued by Jewish scholars were those which dealt with astrology, medicine, and astral magic; however shunned by Maimonides as dangerous and destructive.\n\nDespite Maimonides' denunciation of Hermetism, Jewish scholars in the Renaissance struggled to reconcile his beliefs with those of the proponents of Hermetic thought within Judaism. Renaissance scholars argued that the rationalism of Maimonides drew upon the prisca sapienta that had both Mosaic and Hermetic origins and that Abraham ibn Ezra's Commentary on the Pentateuch was evidence that they shared the same views on the relationship between religion and science.\n\nHowever, scholars such as Averroist Elijah del Medigo carried on Maimonides' crusade. Medigo claimed that the theurgic practices of Hermetism were against the teachings of the Torah. Others, such as Yohanan Alemanno, claimed that the Hermetic teachings were part of a primordial wisdom of the ancients and put the writings of Hermes as being equal to those of King Solomon. Hermetism was also prominent in the works of David Messer Leon, Isaac Abravanel, Judah Abravanel, Elijah Hayyim, Abraham Farissol, Judah Moscato and Abraham Yagel.\n\nThe works of Baruch Spinoza have also been ascribed a Hermetic element and Hermetic influenced thinkers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe have accepted Spinoza's version of God.\n\nHermetism had a strong philosophical influence, especially from Stoicism and Platonism.\n\nMuch of the Western Esoteric tradition is based on a blend of Hermeticism and the \"Kabbalah Ma'asit\", so called magical or practical Kabbalah. Occultism uses the Hermetic and Kabbalistic theory of creation and angelic/demonic forces, as a basis for ritual magic, and theurgy. Most magic theory involves the manipulation of Yetzirah, the world of Formation, and letting the effect trickle down to the physical universe (in accordance to the Hermetic concept of \"as above, so below\"). This includes the communication and manipulation of inhabitants of Yetzirah, angelic or demonic forces. The spelling of \"Qabalah\", is generally referred to as the Hermetic Qabalah, often having a magical or occult slant. While \"Kabbalah\" refers to the traditional Jewish branch.\n\nThese beliefs were influential in European occult lore, especially from the Renaissance forward. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, magicians wrote grimoires which show a major influence from both Hermeticism and Kabbalah and have since become a basis for most practical occultism. In more recent times, magical orders such as The Golden Dawn have revived and revised these traditions.\n\nCatherine L Albanese theorized that Transcendentalism has Hermetic influence. Among Transcendentalist thinkers, she especially points to Ralph Waldo Emerson who has ideas of humankind transcending into deification similar to those of Joseph Smith. She also points to the spiritual narcissism of Henry David Thoreau.\n\nNeopaganism is directly related to Hermeticism. The Renaissance Hermetists Plethon and Ficino are the foundation of the Western Mystery Tradition from which contemporary Neopaganism arose. Wicca, one of the earliest and most famous of the Neopagan religions, honours a Goddess and a God, who are seen by some as being aspects of a single greater deity. See Wiccan views of divinity. Silver Ravenwolf expresses this in terms of the Qabalistic Tree of Life:\n\nRavenwolf holds that the God and Goddess are merely the masculine and feminine aspects of The All, and that both in turn express themselves through sub-aspects as the gods and goddesses of the various pantheons, just as in Hermeticism archangels, angels, and demons are all seen as embodying aspects of God.\n\nThe Hermetic use of signs, herbs, stones and animal imagery as a means for drawing down the planetary powers into such signs is mirrored in the sympathetic magic practices of Neopagan witchcraft.\n\nAmongst pagan white supremacist groups, the Odinist White Order of Thule integrates Hermetic philosophy into its indoctrination process.\n\nZoroastrianism plays a large role in influencing Hermeticism. In 525 BCE, Egypt was conquered by the Persian Empire, bringing Zoroastrian ideas along with it. In obscure texts, Hermes claims to look to Zoroaster as a spiritual father, having learned much of the zodiac from him. It is further said that Zoroaster had penetrated the mystery of the zodiac more than any other. Alternatively, it has been suggested that Zoroaster (like so many others) and Hermes are one and the same. However, it is possible that this was from a faked Zoroastrian text. Theurgy is often called Zoroastrian Magic as well.\n\n"}

More technically, it is a cone of force that propagates through a brittle, amorphous or cryptocrystalline solid material from a point of impact. This force eventually removes a full or partial cone in the material. This is the physical principle that explains the form and characteristics of the flakes removed from a core of tool stone during the process of lithic reduction.\n\nThis phenomenon is named after the German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz, who first described this type of wave-front propagation through various media.\n\nAlthough it might not be agreed by all, natural phenomena which have been grouped with the Hertzian cone phenomena include the crescentic \"chatter marks\" made on smoothed bedrock by glacial ice dragging along boulders at its base, the numerous crescentic impact marks sometimes seen on pebbles and cobbles, and the shatter cones found at bolide impact sites. James Byous, working independently (at privately funded Dowd Research, Savannah, Georgia USA) has made a protracted study of Hertzian cones. Some of his work may be found via sharing points or directly at Dowd Research. He has produced a comprehensive glossary on Hertzian fractures and related terms. A Hertzian cone is often 104 degrees when created by an indenter. Smaller cones may be produced due to lack of size of the material, or irregularities in the structure of the material. However, in ballistics the faster the projectile the steeper the edges and angle of the cone.\n\n"}

When George Washington asked Alexander Hamilton to defend the constitutionality of the First Bank of the United States against the protests of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Attorney General Edmund Randolph, Hamilton produced what has now become the classic statement for implied powers. Hamilton argued that the sovereign duties of a government implied the right to use means adequate to its ends. Although the United States government was sovereign only as to certain objects, it was impossible to define all the means it should use, because it was impossible for the founders to anticipate all future exigencies. Hamilton noted that the \"general welfare clause\" and the \"necessary and proper clause\" gave elasticity to the Constitution. Hamilton won the argument with Washington, who signed the bank bill into law.\n\nLater, directly borrowing from Hamilton, Chief Justice John Marshall invoked the implied powers of government in the United States Supreme Court case, \"McCulloch v. Maryland\". In 1816, the United States Congress passed legislation creating the Second Bank of the United States. The state of Maryland attempted to tax the bank. The state argued the United States Constitution did not explicitly grant Congress the power to establish banks. In 1819, the Court decided against the state of Maryland. Chief Justice Marshall argued that Congress had the right to establish the bank, as the Constitution grants to Congress certain implied powers beyond those explicitly stated.\n\nIn the case of the United States Government, implied powers are powers Congress exercises that the Constitution does not explicitly define, but are necessary and proper to execute the powers.\n\nImplied powers are those that can reasonably be assumed to flow from express powers, though not explicitly mentioned. The legitimacy of these powers is derived from the Taxing and Spending Clause, the Necessary and Proper Clause, and the Commerce Clause. \n"}

Oates published her first book in 1962 and has since published over 40 novels, as well as a number of plays and novellas, and many volumes of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction. She has won many awards for her writing, including the National Book Award, for her novel \"them\" (1969), two O. Henry Awards, and the National Humanities Medal. Her novels \"Black Water\" (1992), \"What I Lived For\" (1994), \"Blonde\" (2000), and short story collections, \"The Wheel of Love\" (1970) and \"Lovely, Dark, Deep: Stories\" (2014) were each finalists for the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nOates has taught at Princeton University since 1978 and is currently the Roger S. Berlind '52 Professor Emerita in the Humanities with the Program in Creative Writing.\n\nOates was born in Lockport, New York, the eldest of three children of Carolina (née Bush), a homemaker of Hungarian descent, and Frederic James Oates, a tool and die designer.\n\nHer brother, Fred Jr., was born in 1943, and her sister, Lynn Ann, who is severely autistic, was born in 1956. Oates grew up in the working-class farming community of Millersport, New York, and characterized hers as \"a happy, close-knit and unextraordinary family for our time, place and economic status\", but her childhood as \"a daily scramble for existence\". Her paternal grandmother, Blanche Woodside, lived with the family and was \"very close\" to Joyce. After Blanche's death, Joyce learned that Blanche's father had killed himself, and Blanche had subsequently concealed her Jewish heritage; Oates eventually drew on aspects of her grandmother's life in writing the novel \"The Gravedigger's Daughter\" (2007).\n\nOates attended the same one-room school her mother had attended as a child. She became interested in reading at an early age and remembers Blanche's gift of Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865) as \"the great treasure of my childhood, and the most profound literary influence of my life. This was love at first sight!\" In her early teens, she devoured the writing of Charlotte Brontë, Emily Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, and Henry David Thoreau, whose \"influences remain very deep\". Oates began writing at the age of 14, when Blanche gave her a typewriter. Oates later transferred to several bigger, suburban schools and graduated from Williamsville South High School in 1956, where she worked for her high school newspaper. She was the first in her family to complete high school.\n\nAs a teen, Oates also received early recognition for her writing by winning a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.\n\nOates earned a scholarship to attend Syracuse University, where she joined Phi Mu. Oates found Syracuse \"a very exciting place academically and intellectually\", and trained herself by \"writing novel after novel and always throwing them out when I completed them\". It was at this point that Oates began reading the work of Franz Kafka, D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann, and Flannery O'Connor, and she noted, \"these influences are still quite strong, pervasive\". At the age of 19, she won the \"college short story\" contest sponsored by \"Mademoiselle\". Oates graduated as valedictorian from Syracuse University with a degree in English in 1960 and received her M.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1961. She was a Ph.D. student at Rice University when she made the decision to become a full-time writer.\n\nEvelyn Shrifte, president of the Vanguard Press, met Oates soon after Oates received her master's degree. \"She was fresh out of school, and I thought she was a genius,\" Shrifte said. Vanguard published Oates' first book, the short-story collection \"By the North Gate\", in 1963.\n\nThe Vanguard Press published Oates' first novel, \"With Shuddering Fall\" (1964), when she was 26 years old. In 1966, she published \"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\", a short story dedicated to Bob Dylan and written after listening to his song \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\". The story is loosely based on the serial killer Charles Schmid, also known as \"The Pied Piper of Tucson\". It has been anthologized many times and adapted as a film, \"Smooth Talk\" starring Laura Dern (1985).\n\nIn 2008, Oates said that of all her published work, she is most noted for \"Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?\". Another early short story, \"In a Region of Ice\" (\"The Atlantic Monthly\", August 1966), features a young, gifted Jewish-American student. It dramatizes his drift into protest against the world of education and the sober, established society of his parents, his depression, and eventually murder-cum-suicide. It was inspired by a real-life incident (as were several of her works) and Oates had been acquainted with the model of her protagonist. She revisited this subject in the title story of her collection \"Last Days: Stories\" (1984). \"In the Region of Ice\" won the first of her two O. Henry Awards.\n\nHer second novel was \"A Garden of Earthly Delights\" (1967), first of the so-called Wonderland Quartet published by Vanguard 1967-71. All were finalists for the annual National Book Award. Her novel \"them\" (1969) won the 1970 National Book Award for Fiction. It is set in Detroit during a time span from the 1930s to the 1960s, most of it in black ghetto neighborhoods, and deals openly with crime, drugs, and racial/class conflicts. Again, some of the key characters and events were based on real people whom Oates had known or heard of during her years in the city. Since then she has published an average of two books a year. Frequent topics in her work include rural poverty, sexual abuse, class tensions, desire for power, female childhood and adolescence, and occasionally the supernatural. Violence is a constant in her work, even leading Oates to have written an essay in response to the question, \"Why Is Your Writing So Violent?\"\n\nIn 1990 she discussed her novel, \"Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart\", which also deals with themes of racial tension, and described \"the experience of writing [it]\" as \"so intense it seemed almost electric\". She is a fan of poet and novelist Sylvia Plath, describing Plath's sole novel \"The Bell Jar\" as a \"near perfect work of art\", but though Oates has often been compared to Plath, she disavows Plath's romanticism about suicide, and among her characters, she favors cunning, hardy survivors, both women and men. In the early 1980s, Oates began writing stories in the Gothic and horror genres; in her foray into these genres, Oates said she was \"deeply influenced\" by Kafka and felt \"a writerly kinship\" with James Joyce.\n\nIn 1996, Oates published \"We Were the Mulvaneys\", a novel following the disintegration of an American family, which became a best-seller after being selected by Oprah's Book Club in 2001. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Oates wrote several books, mostly suspense novels, under the pen names Rosamond Smith and Lauren Kelly.\n\nFor more than 25 years, Oates has been rumored to be a favorite to win the Nobel Prize in Literature by oddsmakers and critics. Her papers, held at Syracuse University, include 17 unpublished short stories and four unpublished or unfinished novellas. Oates has said that most of her early unpublished work was \"cheerfully thrown away\".\n\nOne review of Oates's 1970 story collection \"The Wheel of Love\" characterized her as an author \"of considerable talent\" but at that time \"far from being a great writer\".\n\nOates's 2006 short story \"Landfill\" was criticized because it drew on the death, several months earlier, of John A. Fiocco Jr., a 19-year-old New Jersey college student.\n\nIn 1998 Oates received the F. Scott Fitzgerald Award for Achievement in American Literature award which is given annually to recognize outstanding achievement in American literature. The day-long festival takes place in Rockville, Maryland, the city where Fitzgerald, his wife, and their daughter are all interred, as part of the F. Scott Fitzgerald Literary Festival.\n\nOates founded \"The Ontario Review\", a literary magazine, in 1974, with Raymond J. Smith, her husband and fellow graduate student, who would eventually become a professor of 18th-century literature. Smith would serve as editor of this venture, and Oates served as associate editor. The magazine's mission, according to Smith, the editor, was to bridge the literary and artistic culture of the US and Canada: \"We tried to do this by publishing writers and artists from both countries, as well as essays and reviews of an intercultural nature.\" In 1978, Sylvester & Orphanos published \"Sentimental Education\".\n\nIn 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as \"a marriage of like minds — both my husband and I are so interested in literature and we read the same books; he'll be reading a book and then I'll read it — we trade and we talk about our reading at meal times…\".\n\nOates taught in Beaumont, Texas, for a year, then moved to Detroit in 1962, where she began teaching at the University of Detroit. Influenced by the Vietnam war, the 1967 Detroit race riots, and a job offer, Oates moved across the river into Canada in 1968 with her husband, to a teaching position at the University of Windsor in Ontario. In 1978, she moved to Princeton, New Jersey, and began teaching at Princeton University.\n\nAmong others, Oates influenced Jonathan Safran Foer, who took an introductory writing course with Oates in 1995 as a Princeton undergraduate. Foer recalled later that Oates took an interest in his writing and his \"most important of writerly qualities, energy,\" noting that she was \"the first person to ever make me think I should try to write in any sort of serious way. And my life really changed after that.\" Oates served as Foer's senior thesis advisor, which was an early version of his novel \"Everything Is Illuminated\" (published to acclaim in 2002).\n\nOates retired from teaching in 2014 and was honored at a retirement party in November of that year.\n\nJoyce Carol Oates has taught creative writing at UC Berkeley for the past few years, her last course being in Spring 2018.\n\nOates was raised Catholic but is now an atheist. She views religion as a psychological manifestation of deep imaginative powers that are always with you.\n\nOates self identifies as a liberal, and supports gun control. She is a vocal critic of US President Donald Trump and his policies both in public and on Twitter.\n\nOates opposed the shuttering of cultural institutions on Trump's inauguration day as a protest against the president, stating \"This would only hurt artists. Rather, cultural institutions should be sanctuaries for those repelled by the inauguration.\"\n\nOates is a regular poster on Twitter with her account given to her by her publisher Harper Collins. She has drawn particular criticism for the perceived Islamophobia of her tweets. Oates stated in her criticized tweet, \"Where 99.3% of women report having been sexually harassed & rape is epidemic – Egypt – natural to inquire: what's the predominant religion?\" She later backtracked from that statement. Oates was also criticized for responding to a Mississippi school's pulling of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" from its eighth grade curriculum with a tweet claiming that Mississippians don't read.\n\nOates defended her statements on Twitter saying, \"I don't consider that I really said anything that I don't feel and I think that sometimes the crowd is not necessarily correct. You know, Kierkegaard said, 'The crowd is a lie.' The sort of lynch mob mentality among some people on Twitter and they rush after somebody — they rush in this direction; they rush over here; they're kind of rushing around the landscape of the news\".\n\nOates writes in longhand, working from \"8 till 1 every day, then again for two or three hours in the evening.\" Her prolificacy has become one of her best-known attributes, although often discussed disparagingly. \"The New York Times\" wrote in 1989 that Oates's \"name is synonymous with productivity\", and in 2004, \"The Guardian\" noted that \"Nearly every review of an Oates book, it seems, begins with a list [of the number of books she has published]\".\n\nIn a journal entry written in the 1970s, Oates sarcastically addressed her critics, writing, \"So many books! so many! Obviously JCO has a full career behind her, if one chooses to look at it that way; many more titles and she might as well... what?...give up all hopes for a 'reputation'? […] but I work hard, and long, and as the hours roll by I seem to create more than I anticipate; more, certainly, than the literary world allows for a 'serious' writer. Yet I have more stories to tell, and more novels […] \". In \"The New York Review of Books\" in 2007, Michael Dirda suggested that disparaging criticism of Oates \"derives from reviewer's angst: How does one judge a new book by Oates when one is not familiar with most of the backlist? Where does one start?\"\n\nSeveral publications have published lists of what they deem the best Joyce Carol Oates books, designed to help introduce readers to the author's daunting oeuvre. In a 2003 article entitled \"Joyce Carol Oates for dummies\", \"The Rocky Mountain News\" recommended starting with her early short stories and the novels \"A Garden of Earthly Delights\" (1967), \"them\" (1969), \"Wonderland\" (1971), \"Black Water\" (1992), and \"Blonde\" (2000). In 2006, \"The Times\" listed \"them\", \"On Boxing\" (in collaboration with photographer John Ranard) (1987), \"Black Water\", and \"\" (2006) as \"The Pick of Joyce Carol Oates\". In 2007, \"Entertainment Weekly\" listed its Oates favorites as \"Wonderland\", \"Black Water\", \"Blonde\", \"I'll Take You There\" (2002), and \"The Falls\" (2004). In 2003, Oates herself said that she thinks she will be remembered for, and would most want a first-time Oates reader to read, \"them\" and \"Blonde\", although she \"could as easily have chosen a number of titles.\"\n\nOates met Raymond J. Smith, a fellow graduate student, at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and they married in 1961. Smith became a professor of 18th-century literature and later, an editor and publisher. Oates described the partnership as \"a marriage of like minds…\" and \"a very collaborative and imaginative marriage.\"\n\nAs a diarist, Oates began keeping a detailed journal in 1973, documenting her personal and literary life; it eventually grew to \"more than 4,000 single-spaced typewritten pages\". In 2008, Oates said she had \"moved away from keeping a formal journal\" and instead preserves copies of her e-mails.\n\nOates's spouse Raymond Smith died of complications from pneumonia on February 18, 2008, and the death impacted Oates profoundly. In April 2008, Oates wrote to an interviewer, \"Since my husband's unexpected death, I really have very little energy […] My marriage—my love for my husband—seems to have come first in my life, rather than my writing. Set beside his death, the future of my writing scarcely interests me at the moment.\" After six months of near suicidal grieving for Raymond Smith, Oates met Charles Gross, a professor in the Psychology Department and Neuroscience Institute at Princeton, at a dinner party at her home. In early 2009, Oates and Gross were married.\n\nAs of 1999, Oates remained devoted to running, of which she has written, \"Ideally, the runner who's a writer is running through the land- and cityscapes of her fiction, like a ghost in a real setting.\" While running, Oates mentally envisions scenes in her novels and works out structural problems in already-written drafts; she formulated the germ of her novel \"You Must Remember This\" (1987) while running, when she \"glanced up and saw the ruins of a railroad bridge\", which reminded her of \"a mythical upstate New York city in the right place\".\n\nOates was a member of the Board of Trustees of the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation from 1997 to 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "2161348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2161348", "title": "Liber Historiae Francorum", "text": "Liber Historiae Francorum\n\nLiber Historiae Francorum () is a chronicle written anonymously during the 8th century. The first sections served as a secondary source for early Franks in the time of Marcomer, giving a short of events until the time of the late Merovingians. The subsequent sections of the chronicle are important primary sources for the contemporaneous history. They provide an account of the Pippinid family in Austrasia before they became the most famous Carolingians.\n\nRichard Gerberding, a modern editor of the text, vindicates the coherence and accuracy of its account while giving reasons for locating the anonymous author in Soissons, who was likely a part of the royal monastery of Saint-Medard. Richard Gerberding characterizes the author as Neustrian and as \"a staunch Merovingian legitimate, secular as opposed to ecclesiastically minded, and an enthusiastic admirer and probably a member of that aristocratic class based on the Seine-Oise valley whose deeds, wars and kings he describes\". \n\n\"Liber Historiae Francorum\" is customarily dated to the year 727 because of a reference to the end of the sixth year of Theuderic IV. It offers a Neustrian perspective of the era of mayors of the palace, where the factions of the great territorial magnates could only be held in check and balanced by the consecrated legitimacy of the Merovingian king. \"Liber Historiae Francorum\" has been explored and interpreted by Richard Gerberding, and more recently by Rosamond McKitterick, in \"History and Memory in the Carolingian World\". As a widely read narrative, it helped create a sense of cultural solidarity among the readership for whom it was intended, whose biases it caters to, and whose political agenda it promotes.\n\nAs for that agenda, Fouracre and Gerberding show that the book supports the kings of the Merovingian dynasty only insofar as they rule with the consultation of the major nobles. The nobles, in turn, are supported only insofar as they do not aspire above their station.\n\nIt is one of a \"corpus\" of new books of history written in the 8th century, and copied and widely distributed in the 9th century, which offered their readers (and listeners) a pure and comprehensive background that set the Franks only distantly in the context of the Roman Empire (the Roman Empire is virtually ignored) and more immediately in the Christian Gallo-Roman world.\n\nFrom the outset, the book promises to present the origins and deeds of the Frankish kings and people. It erroneously states that the Franks originated from a group of Trojan refugees, similar to the Italian refugees of the Aeneid, finding themselves on the north coast of the Black Sea, before making their way across the Danubian Plain to the Rhineland. To accomplish this, the book relies heavily on the Gallo-Roman bishop and historian Gregory of Tours, who died in 594, whose history it epitomizes and occasionally augments and parallels.\n\nThe last 19 chapters, numbered 35 through 53 in Bruno Krusch's edition, present an independent account of events in the Frankish lands in the 7th and early 8th centuries.\n\nThe work begins with Chlothar II (584–629), who started his reign as an infant King of Neustria, one of the smallest territories of Francia. He was under the regency of his mother, Fredegund, and in an uneasy alliance with Chlothar's uncle Guntram, King of Burgundy (d. 592). Chlothar assumed full power over Neustria upon the death of his mother in 597 and continued his mother's feud with Queen Brunhilda of Austrasia with equal viciousness and bloodshed, finally achieving her execution in an especially brutal manner in 613 and uniting Francia under his rule. Like his father, he built up his territories by invading after the deaths of other kings. \n\nChlothar's reign was lengthy by contemporary standards, but saw the continuing erosion of royal power by the nobility against a backdrop of feuding Merovingians. The Edict of Paris in 614, which was concerned with several aspects of appointments to offices and the administration of the kingdom, has been interpreted in different ways by modern historians. In 617, Chlothar made the Mayor of the Palace a role held for life, an important step in the progression of this office from being first the manager of the royal household to the effective head of government, and eventually the monarch, under Pepin the Younger in 751. Chlothar ceded rule over Austrasia to his young son Dagobert I in 623. Unusually for a Merovingian monarch, he practiced monogamy, though deaths meant that he had three queens. He was generally an ally of the church and, perhaps inspired by the example of his uncle Guntram, his reign seems to lack the outrageous acts of murder perpetrated by many of his relations, with the exception of the execution of Brunhilda.\n\nChapter 43 relates the attempted usurpation of Austrasia by the Pippinid mayor Grimoald the Elder in summary form. It ends with Grimoald's death by torture under Clovis II who ruled Neustria. Chapter 44 comments on Clovis: \nAt the same time, he brought ruin to the kingdom of the Franks with disastrous calamities. This Clovis, moreover, had every kind of filthy habit. He was a seducer and a debaser of women, a glutton, and a drunk. About his death and end, nothing of historical worth may be said. Many writers condemn his end because they do not know the extent of his evil. Thus in uncertainty concerning it, they refer from one to another.\n\nThe rest of this chapter and the beginning of the next chapter stretch between Clovis's death, usually dated to the late 650s, and the accession of Theuderic III, usually dated to 673, a four-year reign of \"the boy king Chlotar\".\n\nChapters 45ff, as Ursinus the Abbot had done, provide a hostile account of mayor Ebroin of Neustria. In contrast to the description of Clovis II quoted above, the author has nothing but praise for Childebert III, \"a famous man\", whom he describes as \"the glorious lord of good memory, Childebert, the just king.\" The closing chapters mainly cover Charles Martel.\n\n\"Liber Historiae Francorum\" became a primary source for the Continuations to Fredegar's Chronicle, as redacted by Count Childebrand in 751 on behalf of his half-brother, Charles Martel.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his discovery, simultaneously with Antoine Lavoisier, of oxygen gas.\n\nA member of marginalized religious groups throughout his life and a proponent of what was called \"rational Dissent,\" Priestley advocated religious toleration and equal rights for Dissenters. He argued for extensive civil rights in works such as the important \"Essay on the First Principles of Government\", believing that individuals could bring about progress and eventually the Millennium; he was the foremost British expounder of providentialism. Priestley also made significant contributions to education, publishing, among other things, \"The Rudiments of English Grammar\", a seminal work on English grammar. In his most lasting contributions to education, he argued for the benefits of a liberal arts education and of the value of the study of modern history. In his metaphysical works, Priestley \"attempt[ed] to combine theism, materialism, and determinism,\" a project that has been called \"audacious and original.\"\n\nThroughout his life, Priestley was known not only as a political and theological controversialist but also as a natural philosopher. His scientific reputation rested on his writings on electricity, his invention of soda water, and his discovery of 10 previously unknown \"Airs\" (gases), that he reported about from 1774-1786 in a giant book of 6 volumes: Experiments and Observations on Different Kinds of Air. The most important of these newly discovered airs, was named by Priestley as \"dephlogisticated air\" (oxygen). But Priestley's determination to reject Lavoisier's \"new chemistry\" and to cling to phlogiston theory left him isolated within the scientific community.\n\nThis list classifies all of the works by Priestley.

{"id": "14599402", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14599402", "title": "Names of the Celts", "text": "Names of the Celts\n\nThe various names used since classical times for the people known today as the Celts are of disparate origins.\n\nThe name (\"Keltoi\") and is used in Greek and Latin, respectively, as the name of a people of the La Tène horizon in the region of the upper Rhine and Danube during the 6th to 1st centuries BC in Greco-Roman ethnography. The etymology of this name and that of the Gauls / is of uncertain etymology. The name of the Welsh, on the other hand, is taken from the designator used by the Germanic peoples for Celtic- and Latin-speaking peoples, *\"Walhaz\", meaning \"foreign\".\n\nThe linguistic sense of the name \"Celts\", grouping all speakers of Celtic languages, is modern. In particular, aside from a 1st-century literary genealogy of \"Celtus\" the grandson of \"Bretannos\" by Heracles, there is no record of the term \"Celt\" being used prior to the 17th century in connection with the inhabitants of Ireland and Britain during the Iron Age.\n\nThe first recorded use of the name of Celts – as (\"Keltoi\") – to refer to an ethnic group was by Hecataeus of Miletus, the Greek geographer, in 517 BC, when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille). In the 5th century BC Herodotus referred to \"Keltoi\" living around the head of the Danube and also in the far west of Europe.\n\nThe etymology of the term \"Keltoi\" is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *\"k´el\"-‘to hide’ (also in Old Irish celid), IE *\"k´el\"- ‘to heat’ or *\"kel\"- ‘to impel’. Several authors have supposed it to be Celtic in origin, while others view it as a name coined by Greeks. Linguist Patrizia De Bernardo Stempel falls in the latter group, and suggests the meaning \"the tall ones\".\n\nThe Romans preferred the name Gauls () for those Celts whom they first encountered in northern Italy (Cisalpine Gaul). In the first century BC Caesar referred to the Gauls as calling themselves Celts in their own tongue.\n\nAccording to the 1st-century poet Parthenius of Nicaea, Celtus (, \"Keltos\") was the son of Heracles and Celtine (, \"Keltine\"), the daughter of Bretannus (, \"Brettanos\"); this literary genealogy exists nowhere else and was not connected with any known cult. Celtus became the eponymous ancestor of Celts. In Latin came in turn from Herodotus' word for the Gauls, . The Romans used to refer to continental Gauls, but apparently not to Insular Celts. The latter are divided linguistically into Goidels and Brythons.\n\nThe name \"Celtiberi\" is used by Diodorus Siculus in the 1st century BC, of a people which he considered a mixture of \"Celtae\" and \"Iberi\".\n\nAside from the Celtiberians —Lusones, Titi, Arevaci and Pelendones among others— who inhabited large regions of central Spain, Greek and Roman geographers also spoke of a people or group of peoples called \"Celtici\" or \"Κελτικοί\", living in the South of modern-day Portugal, in the Alentejo region, between the Tagus and the Guadiana rivers. They are first mentioned by Strabo, who wrote that they were the most numerous people inhabiting that region. Later, the description of Ptolemy shows a more reduced territory, comprising the regions from Évora to Setúbal, being the coastal and southern areas occupied by the Turdetani.\n\nA second group of Celtici was mentioned by Pliny living in the region of Baeturia (northwestern Andalusia); he considered that they proceeded \"of the Celtiberians from the Lusitania, because of their religion, language, and because of the names of their cities\".\n\nIn the North, in Galicia, another group of Celtici dwelt the coastal areas. They comprised several \"populi\", including the Celtici proper: the \"Praestamarci\" south of the Tambre river (\"Tamaris\"), the \"Supertamarci\" north of it, and the \"Neri\" by the Celtic promontory (\"Promunturium Celticum\"). Pomponius Mela affirmed that all the inhabitants of the coastal regions, from the bays of southern Galicia and till the Astures, were also Celtici: \"All (this coast) is inhabited by the Celtici, except from the Douro river to the bays, where the Grovi dwelt (…) In the north coast first there are the Artabri, still of the Celtic people (\"Celticae gentis\"), and after them the Astures.\" He also mentioned the fabulous isles of tin, the \"Cassiterides\", as situated among these Celtici.\n\nThe Celtici Supertarmarci have also left a number of inscriptions, as the Celtici Flavienses did. Several villages and rural parishes still bear the name \"Céltigos\" (from Latin \"Celticos\") in Galicia. This is also the name of an archpriesthood of the Catholic Church, a division of the archbishopric of Santiago de Compostela, encompassing part of the lands attributed to the Celtici Supertamarci by ancient authors.\n\nThe name of the \"Celtae\" is revived in the learned literature of the Early Modern period.\nThe French \"celtique\" and the German \"celtisch\" appear in the 16th century. The English word \"Celts\" is first attested in 1607.\nThe adjective \"Celtic\", formed after French \"celtique\", appears a little later, in the mid 17th century. An early attestation is found in Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" (1667), in reference to the Insular Celts of antiquity: \"[the Ionian gods ... who] o'er the Celtic [fields] roamed the utmost Isles.\" (I.520, here in the 1674 spelling).\n\nUse of \"Celtic\" in the linguistic sense arises in the 18th century, in the work of Edward Lhuyd.\n\nIn the 18th century the interest in \"primitivism\", which led to the idea of the \"noble savage\", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things \"Celtic\". The antiquarian William Stukeley pictured a race of \"Ancient Britons\" constructing the \"Temples of the Ancient Celts\" such as Stonehenge (actually a pre-Celtic structure) before he decided in 1733 to recast the \"Celts\" in his book as \"Druids\". The Ossian fables written by James Macpherson - portrayed as ancient Scottish Gaelic poems - added to this romantic enthusiasm. The \"Irish revival\" came after the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829 as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became known as the \"Celtic revival\".\n\nThe initial consonant of the English words \"Celt\" and \"Celtic\" is realised primarily as and occasionally in both modern UK standard English and American English, although was formerly the norm. \nIn the oldest attested Greek form, and originally also in Latin, it was pronounced , but a regular process of palatalization around the first century AD changed → in later Latin whenever it appears beside a front vowel like . The pronunciation with was taken into German, into French, and both at different times were taken into English.\n\nThe English word originates in the 17th century, and until the mid 19th century, the sole pronunciation in English was in keeping with the way the letter ⟨c⟩ was inherited by Middle English from Old French. From the mid-19th century, academic publications advocated the variant with on the basis of a new understanding of the origins of the word. The pronunciation with remained standard throughout the 19th to early 20th century, but gained ground during the later 20th century. \nA notable exception is that the pronunciation remains the most recognised form when it occurs in the names of sports teams, most notably Celtic Football Club in Scotland, and the Boston Celtics basketball team in the United States. The Cavan newspaper \"The Anglo-Celt\" also uses the .\n\nIn current usage the terms \"Celt\" and \"Celtic\" can take several senses depending on context: \nThe Celts of the European Iron Age, the group of Celtic-speaking peoples in historical linguistics, and the modern Celtic identity derived from the Romanticist Celtic Revival.\n\nAfter its use by Edward Lhuyd in 1707, the use of the word \"Celtic\" as an umbrella term for the pre-Roman peoples of the British Isles gained considerable popularity.\nLhuyd was the first to recognise that the Irish, British and Gaulish languages were related to one another, and the inclusion of the Insular Celts under the term \"Celtic\" from this time expresses this linguistic relationship. By the late 18th century, the Celtic languages were recognised as one branch within the larger Indo-European family.\n\nThe Celts are an ethno-linguistic group of Iron Age European peoples, including the Gauls (including derived groups such as the Lepontians and the Galatians), the Celtiberians and the Insular Celts.\n\nThe timeline of Celtic settlement in the British Isles is unclear and the object of much speculation, but it is clear that by the 1st century BC, most of Great Britain and Ireland was inhabited by Celtic-speaking peoples now known as the Insular Celts, divided into two large groups, Brythonic or P-Celtic, and Goidelic or Q-Celtic.\nThe Brythonic groups under Roman rule were known in Latin as \"Britanni\", while use of the names \"Celtae\" or \"Galli\" / \"Galatai\" was restricted to the Gauls. There are no specimens of Goidelic languages prior to the appearance of Primitive Irish inscriptions in the 4th century AD, however there are earlier references to the \"Iverni\" (in Ptolemy ca. 150, later also appearing as \"Hierni\" and \"Hiberni\"), and by 314, to the \"Scoti\".\n\nSimon James argues that, while the term \"Celtic\" expresses a valid linguistic connection, its use of both Insular and Continental Celtic culture is misleading, as archaeology does not suggest a unified Celtic culture during the Iron Age. \n\nWith the rise of Celtic nationalism in the early to mid 19th century, the term \"Celtic\" also came to be a self-designation used by proponents of a modern Celtic identity. Thus, the contributor to \"The Celt\" discussing \"the word Celt\" states \"The Greeks called us Keltoi\", expressing a position of ethnic essentialism that extends the first person pronoun to include both 19th-century Irishmen and the Danubian Κελτοί of Herodotus.\n\nThis sense of \"Celtic\" is preserved in its political sense in Celtic nationalism of organisations such as the Celtic League, but it is also used in a more general unpolitical sense, in expressions such as Celtic music.\n\nLatin might be from an originally Celtic ethnic or tribal name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the early 5th century BC Celtic expansions into Italy. Its root may be the Common Celtic \"*galno-\", meaning \"power\" or \"strength\". The Greek (cf. Galatia in Anatolia) seems to be based on the same root, borrowed directly from the same hypothetical Celtic source which gave us (the suffix \"-atai\" is simply an ethnic name indicator).\n\nSchumacher's account is slightly different: He states that \"Galli\" (nominative singular *\"gallos\") is derived from the present stem of the verb which he reconstructs for Proto-Celtic as *\"gal-nV-\" (it is not clear what the vowel in the suffix, marked as \"V\", should be reconstructed as), whose meaning he gives as \"to be able to, to gain control of\", while \"Galatai\" comes from the same root and is to be reconstructed as nominative singular *\"galatis\" < *\"gelH-ti-s\". He gives the same meaning for both reconstructs, namely \"Machthaber\", i. e. \"potentate, ruler (or even warlord)\", or alternatively \"Plünderer, Räuber\", i. e. \"raider, looter, pillager, marauder\", and points out that both names can be exonyms in order to explain their pejorative meaning. The Proto-Indo-European verbal root in question is reconstructed by Schumacher as *\"gelH-\", whose meaning is given as \"Macht bekommen über\", i. e., \"to acquire power over\" in the \"Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben\".\n\nWhile the name of the Gallaeci (also Callaeci or Callaici), a Celtic federation in North-West Iberia, may seem related to \"Galli\", it is not.\nThe Romans named the entire region north of the Douro, where the Castro culture existed, in honour of the castro people that settled in the area of Calle — the \"Callaeci\".\n\nThe English \"Gaul\" and are unrelated to Latin \"Gallia\" and \"Galli\", despite superficial similarity. They are rather derived from the Germanic term \"walha\", \"foreigner, Romanized person\", an exonym applied by Germanic speakers to Celts, likely via a Latinization of Frankish \"Walholant\" \"Gaul\", literally \"Land of the Foreigners\", making it partially cognate with the names Wales and Wallachia, the usual word for the non-Germanic-speaking peoples (Celtic-speaking and Latin-speaking indiscriminately). The Germanic \"w\" is regularly rendered as \"gu\" / \"g\" in French (cf. \"guerre\" = \"war\", \"garder\" = \"ward\"), and the diphthong \"au\" is the regular outcome of \"al\" before a following consonant (cf. \"cheval\" ~ \"chevaux\"). \"Gaule\" or \"Gaulle\" can hardly be derived from Latin \"Gallia\", since \"g\" would become \"j\" before \"a\" (cf. \"gamba\" > \"jambe\"), and the diphthong \"au\" would be unexplained; the regular outcome of Latin \"Gallia\" is \"Jaille\" in French which is found in several western placenames.\n\nThe French term for \"Welsh\" is \"gallois\", which is, however, not derived from the Latin \"Galli\", but, like \"gaulois\", borrowed (with suffix substitution) from Proto Germanic *\"walhisks\" \"Celtic, Gallo-Roman, Romance\" or its Old English descendant \"wælisc\" (= Modern English \"Welsh\"). The English form \"Gaul\" (first recorded in the 17th century) and \"Gaulish\" come from the French \"Gaule\" and \"Gaulois\", which translate Latin \"Gallia\" and \"Gallus, -icus\" respectively. In Old French, the words \"gualeis\", \"galois\", \"walois\" (Northern French phonetics keeping /w/) had different meanings: Welsh or the \"Langue d'oïl\", etc. On the other hand, the word \"Waulle\" (Northern French phonetics keeping /w/) is recorded for the first time in the 13th century to translate the Latin word \"Gallia\", while \"gaulois\" is recorded for the first time in the 15th century, and the scholars use it to translate the Latin words \"Gallus\" / \"Gallicus\". The word comes from Proto-Germanic *\"Walha-\" (see Gaul: Name).\n\nThe English word \"Welsh\" originates from the word \"wælisċ\", the Anglo-Saxon form of *\"walhiska-\", the reconstructed Proto-Germanic word for \"foreign\" or \"Celt\" (South German \"Celtic speaker\", \"French speaker\", \"Italian speaker\"; Old Norse \"valskr\", pl. \"valir\" \"Gaulish\", \"French\"), that is supposed to be derived of the name of the \"Volcae\", a Celtic tribe who lived first in the South of Germany and emigrated then to Gaul.\n\nThe Germanic term may ultimately have a Celtic source: It is possibly the result of a loan of the Celtic tribal name into pre-Germanic, \"*wolk-\" changing according to Grimm's Law to yield proto-Germanic \"*walh-\". The Volcae were one of the Celtic peoples who for two centuries barred the southward expansion of the Germanic tribes (in what is now central Germany) on the line of the Harz mountains and into Saxony and Silesia.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, territories with primarily Romance-speaking populations, such as France and Italy, were known in German as as opposed to , and the word is cognate with \"Vlach\" and \"Walloon\" as well as with the \"-wall\" in \"Cornwall\". Other examples are the surnames \"Wallace\" and \"Walsh\". During the early Germanic period, the term seems to have been applied to the peasant population of the Roman Empire, most of whom were in the areas immediately settled by the Germanic people.\n\nThe term \"Gael\" is, despite superficial similarity, also completely unrelated to either \"Galli\" or \"Gaul\". \nThe name ultimately derives from the Old Irish word \"Goídel\". Lenition rendered the /d/ silent, though it is still represented in spelling of the modern Gaelic languages as : (Irish and Manx) \"Gaedheal\" or \"Gael\", Scottish Gaelic \"Gàidheal\".\n\nThe Celtic-speaking people of Great Britain were known as \"Brittanni\" or \"Brittones\" in Latin and as Βρίττωνες in Greek; an earlier form was \"Pritani\", or Πρετ(τ)αν(ν)οί in Greek (as recorded by Pytheas in the 4th century BC, among others, and surviving in Welsh as \"Prydain\", the old name for Britain). Related to this is *Priteni, the reconstructed self-designation of the people later known as Picts, which is recorded later in Old Irish as \"Cruithin\" and Welsh as \"Prydyn\".\n"}

A political \"culture\" is the product of both the history of a political system and the histories of the members. Thus, it is rooted equally in public events and private experience.\n\nIn 1963, two Americans, Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba, outlined three types of political culture that can be combined to create civic culture. These three key features expressed by both men were composed to establish a link between the public and the government. The first of these features is \"deference\", which considers the concepts of respect, acknowledgment of \"inferiority\" or \"superiority\", and authority in society.\n\nThe second key feature is \"consensus\" which represents the key link between government and public agreement and appeasement. Support for appeasement may not always be shared by the whole nation, but as a whole, people agree to sustain it, meaning it is a common agreement. There are various \"Examples of Consensus\" in British political culture: how people are governed as a whole, consensus regarding the welfare state, agreement as to who acts as head of state, and with what powers.\n\nThe third feature of British political culture is \"homogeneity\". Church attendance as a whole is decreasing. Sections of the Scottish and Welsh populations have called for independence.\n\nThe term political culture was brought into political science to promote the American political system. The concept was used by Gabriel Almond in the late 50s, and outlined in \"The Civic Culture\" (1963, Almond & Verba), but was soon opposed by two European political scientists, Gerhard Lehmbruch and Arend Lijphart. Lehmbruch analysed politics in Switzerland and Austria and Lijphart analysed politics in Netherlands. Both argued that there are political systems that are more stable than the one in the USA.\n\nDifferent typologies of political culture have been proposed. According to political scientist William S. Stewart, all political behavior can be explained as participating in one or more of eight political cultures: anarchism, oligarchy, Tory corporatism, fascism, classical liberalism, radical liberalism, democratic socialism, and Leninist socialism. Societies that exemplify each of these cultures have existed historically.\n\nGabriel Almond and Sidney Verba in \"The Civic Culture\" outlined three pure types of political culture based on level and type of political participation and the nature of people's attitudes toward politics:\n\nAlmond and Verba wrote that these types of political culture can combine to create the civic culture, which mixes the best elements of each.\n\nArend Lijphart wrote that there are different classifications of political culture:\n\nLijphart also classified the structure of society:\nMaría Eugenia Vázquez Semadeni defines political culture as \"the set of discourses and symbolic practices by means of which both individuals and groups articulate their relationship to power, elaborate their political demands and put them at stake.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22994877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22994877", "title": "Proto-globalization", "text": "Proto-globalization\n\nProto-globalization or early modern globalization is a period of the history of globalization roughly spanning the years between 1600 and 1800, following the period of archaic globalization. First introduced by historians A. G. Hopkins and Christopher Bayly, the term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of so-called \"modern globalization\" in the 19th century.\n\nProto-globalization distinguished itself from modern globalization on the basis of expansionism, the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period of proto-globalization is marked by such trade arrangements as the East India Company, the shift of hegemony to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Year War, and a rise of new commodities—most particularly slave trade. The Triangular Trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the western hemisphere. The transfer of plant and animal crops and epidemic diseases associated with Alfred Crosby's concept of The Columbian Exchange also played a central role in this process. Proto-globalization trade and communications involved a vast group including European, Muslim, Indian, Southeast Asian and Chinese merchants, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.\n\nThe transition from proto-globalization to modern globalization was marked with a more complex global network based on both capitalistic and technological exchange; however, it led to a significant collapse in cultural exchange.\n\nAlthough the 17th and 18th centuries saw a rise in Western Imperialism in the world system, the period of Proto-globalization involved increased interaction between Western Europe and the systems that had formed between nations in East Asia and the Middle East. Proto-globalization was a period of reconciling the governments and traditional systems of individual nations, world regions, and religions with the \"new world order\" of global trade, imperialism and political alliances, what historian A.G. Hopkins called \"the product of the contemporary world and the product of distant past.\"\n\nAccording to Hopkins, \"globalization remains an incomplete process: it promotes fragmentation as well as uniformity; it may recede as well as advance; its geographical scope may exhibit a strong regional bias; its future direction and speed cannot be predicted with confidence—and certainly not by presuming that it has an 'inner logic' of its own. Before proto-globalization, globalizing networks were the product of \"great kings and warriors searching for wealth and honor in fabulous lands, by religious wanderers...and by merchant princes\". Proto-globalization held on to and matured many aspects of archaic globalization such as the importance of cities, migrants, and specialization of labor.\n\nProto-globalization was also marked by two main political and economic developments: \"the reconfiguration of the state systems, and the growth of finance, services, and pre-industrial manufacturing\". A number of states at the time began to \"strengthen their connections between territory, taxation, and sovereignty\" despite their continuing monopoly of loyalties from their citizens. The process of globalization during this time was heavily focused on material world and the labor needed for its production. The proto-globalization period was a time of \"improved efficiency in the transactions sector\" with the generation of goods such as sugar, tobacco, tea, coffee, and opium unlike anything the archaic globalization possessed. The improvement of economic management also spread to the expansion of transportation which created a complex set of connection between the West and East. The expansion of trade routes led to the \"green revolution\" based on the plantation system and slave exportation from Africa.\n\nDuring the pre-modern era early forms of globalization were already beginning to affect a world system, marking a period that historian A. G. Hopkins has called archaic globalization. The world system leading up to proto-globalization was one that hinged on one or more hegemonic powers assimilating neighboring cultures into their political system, waging war on other nations, and dominating world trade.\nA major hegemony in archaic globalization was the Roman Empire, which united the Greater Mediterranean Area and Western Europe through a long-running series of military and political campaigns expanding the Roman system of government and Roman values to more underdeveloped areas. Conquered areas became provinces of the empire and Roman military outposts in the provinces became cities with structures designed by the best Roman architects, which hastened the spread of Rome's \"modern\" way of life while absorbing the traditions and beliefs of these native cultures. Nationalist ideology as well as propaganda supporting the Roman Army and military success, bravery, and valor also strengthened the Roman Empire's spread across Western Europe and the Mediterranean Area. The Roman Empire's well-built aqueducts and cities and sturdy, effective naval fleets, ships and an organized system of paved roads also facilitated fast, easy travel and better networking and trade with neighboring nations and the provinces.\n\nDuring the Han dynasty under Han Wudi (141–87 BCE), the Chinese government united and became powerful enough that China began to successfully indulge in imperialistic endeavors with its neighboring nations in East Asia. Han China's imperialism was a peaceful tributary system, which focused mainly on diplomatic and trade relations. The growth of the Han Empire facilitated trade and cultural exchange with virtually all of the known world as reached from Asia, and Chinese silks spread through Asia and Inner Asia and even to Rome. The early T'ang dynasty saw China as even more responsive to foreign influence and the T'ang dynasty becoming a great empire. Overseas trade with India and the Middle East grew rapidly, and China's East and Southern Coasts, once distant and unimportant regions, gradually became chief areas of foreign trade. During the Song Dynasty China's navy became more powerful thanks to technological improvements in shipbuilding and navigation, and China's maritime commerce also increased exponentially.\n\nChina's power began to decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the subsequent Ming Dynasty neglected the importance of China's trade from sea power. The Ming rulers let China's naval dominance and its grip on the Spice trade slacken, and the European powers stepped in. Portugal, with its technological advances in naval architecture, weaponry, seamanship and navigation, took over the Spice Trade and subdued China's navy. With this, European Imperialism and the age of European Hegemony was beginning, although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade.\n\nOne of the most significant differences between proto-globalization and archaic globalization was the switch from inter-nation trading of rarities to the trading of commodities. During the 12th and 13th centuries it was common to trade items that were foreign and rare to different cultures. A popular trade during archaic globalization involved European merchants sailing to areas of India or China in order to purchase luxury items such as porcelain, silk and spices. Traders of the pre-modern period also traded drugs and certain foods such as sugar cane and other crops.\nWhile these items were not rarities as such, the drugs and food traded were valued for the health and function of the human body. It was more common during proto-globalization to trade various commodities such as cotton, rice and tobacco.\nThe shift into proto-globalization trade signified the \"emergence of the modern international order\" and the development of early capitalist expansion which began in the Atlantic during the 17th century and spread throughout the world by 1830.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the rise of commodities was the rise in the slave trade, specifically the Atlantic slave trade. The use of slaves prior to the 15th century was only a minor practice in the labor force and was not crucial in the development of products and goods; but, due to labor shortage, the use of slaves rose. After 1500, the settlement of island despots and plantation centers in Sao Tome began trade relations with the Kingdom of the Kongo, which brought West Central Africa into the Atlantic Slave Trade. The Portuguese maintained an export of slaves from Agadir, an Atlantic port, which they maintained for most of the early 16th century. Also the Portuguese settlement of the Brazilian subcontinent allowed the opening of the American slave market and slaves were shipped from Sao Tome directly to America. The Europeans also took use of the Atlantic Slave Trade in the first half of the century. The European slave ships took their slaves to the Iberian Peninsula, however slave owners in Europe were only seen in wealthy, aristocrat families due to the high costs of slaves and the cheap peasant labor available for agricultural uses, and as its name implies the first use of the African-American slaves in plantation work arose in the Atlantic islands not in the continental Europe. Approximately 10.2 million Africans survived the Atlantic crossing between 1450 and 1870. The large slave population thrived due to the demand for production from the Europeans who found it cheaper to import crops and goods rather than produce them on their own.\nMany wars were fought during the 17th century between the slave trading companies for areas that were economically dependent on slaves. The West India Company gained many slaves through these wars (specifically with Portugal) by captains who had captured enemy ships; between 1623 and 1637, 2,336 were captured and sold in the New World by the West India Company. The selling of slaves to the New World opened up trading posts in North America; the Dutch opened their first on Manhattan Island in 1613. The West India Company had also opened a trading post in the Caribbean and the company was also carrying slaves to a colony of New Netherland.\nThe use of slaves had many benefits to the economies and productions in the areas of trade. The emergent rise of coffee, tea, and chocolate in Europe led to the demand for the production of sugar; 70 percent of slaves were used solely for the labor-intensive production of crop. Slave trade was also beneficial to the trade voyages, because the constant sailing allowed investors to buy small shares of many ships at the same time. Hopkin states that many scholars, him among them, argue that slave trade was essential to the wealth of many nations, during and after proto-globalization, and without the trade production would have plummeted. The investment in ships and nautical technology was the catalyst to the complex trade networks developed throughout proto-globalization and into modern globalization.\n\nConsequently, the rise of slavery was due to the increasing rise of crops being produced and traded, more specifically the rise of the plantation economy The rise of the plantations was the main reason for the trade of commodities during proto-globalization. Plantations were used by the exporting countries (mainly America) to grow the raw materials needed to manufacture the goods which were traded back into the plantation economy. Commodities that grew in trade due to the plantation economy were mainly tobacco, cotton, sugar cane, and rubber.\n\nDuring the second half of the 16th century, Europeans' interest in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of interest in tobacco was due to the fact that the Amerindians controlled the tobacco industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there was no need for the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.\nThe trading of tobacco was a new commodity and was in high popular demand in the 17th century due to the rise of the plantations. Tobacco began to be used a monetary standard, which is why the term \"cash crop\" was originated.\nThe first export of tobacco from the then-colonies of the United States (specifically Virginia) to London showed fortunes in the English enterprise and by 1627, the Virginia tobacco was being shipped to London at 500,000 pounds a shipment. By 1637, tobacco had become the colony's currency and by 1639 Maryland was exporting 100,000 pounds of tobacco to London. English success with the production of tobacco caught the attention of many Europeans, specifically those colonized on Martinique and Guadeloupe, French islands. These islands soon became wealthy due to the tobacco production and by 1671 roughly one-third of the acreage devoted to the cash crops grown for the islands were for tobacco. While the cultivation of tobacco thrived, production saw severe depressions in later years due to the profits made from sugar. According to an account of the Barbadian exports 82 percent of the island's export value was due to sugar and less than one percent was accounted for by tobacco.\n\nAnother commodity that was a prominent source of trade was the production of sugar from the crop sugar cane. The original habitat of sugar was in India, where it was taken and planted in various islands. Once reaching to the people of the Iberian Peninsula, it was further migrated across the Atlantic Ocean. In the 16th century, the first plantations of sugar were started in the New World, marking the last great stage of migration of the cane to the West. Because of the conflict of transporting sugar in its raw form, sugar was not associated with commerce until the act of refining it came into play; this act became the center for industry. Venice was the center for refining during the Middle Ages, therefore making them the chief traders of sugar. Although, the Spanish and Portuguese held the monopolies of the sugar cane fields in America, they were being supplied by Venice. In the 17th century, England dominated Venice and became the center for refining and cultivating sugar; this leadership was maintained until the rise of French industry. Sugar throughout the 17th century was still considered a luxury until the latter half of the 17th century when the sugar was being produced in mass quantities making it available to the mass of the English people. This turn of events made the sugar a commodity, because the crop was not being used in only special occasion, but in all daily meals.\n\nProto-globalization differed from modern globalization in the practices of expansionism, methods of managing global trade, finances, as well as commercial innovation. With the shift of expansionism by large nations to Western Europe, nations began competing in an effort to achieve world domination. The rise of larger-scale conflicts between these powerful nations over expanding their wealth led to nations taking control over one another’s territory and then moving products and the accumulated wealth of these conquered regions back to the sovereign country. Although conflicts occurred throughout the world between 1600 and 1800, European powers found themselves far more equipped to handle the pressures of war. A quote by Christopher Alan Bayly gives a better interpretation of these advantages by stating, \"Europeans became much better at killing people. The European ideological wars of the 17th century had created links between war, finance, and commercial innovation which extended all these gains. It gave the Continent a brute advantage in world conflicts which broke out in the 18th century. Western European warfare was peculiarly complicated and expensive, partly because it was amphibious.\" These battle-tested nations fought for their own needs, but in reality their success increased European advancement in the global market. Each of the following sections will shed light on the history of several key engagements. Whether a war was religious or commercial, its impact was greatly felt throughout the world. British victories during the Anglo-Dutch Wars led to their dominance in commercial shipping and naval power. The stage was set for future conflicts between Britain and foreign nations, as well as domestic frustration with “the motherland” on the North American continent. The French and Indian War, fought between the European powers of France and England, led to a British victory and resulted in continued dominance in maritime enterprise. The American Revolutionary War marked the beginning of the power shift for control over foreign markets.\n\nThe English Civil War was a battle over not only religious and political beliefs, but also economic and social as well. This war was between Parliamentarians and Royalists and took place from 1642 to 1651, but was broken into several separate engagements. Charles I and his supporters experienced the first two periods of the war, which resulted in King Charles I dissolving Parliament, which would not be called into session again for over ten years. Reasons for this dismissal were because supporters of Long Parliament tried to install two resolutions into English law. One called for consequences against individuals that taxed without the consent of Parliament and labeled them as enemies of England, while the other stated that innovations in religion would result in the same tag. Each of these policies was aimed at Charles I, in that he was inferior leader as well as a supporter of Catholicism. This prompted the Puritan Revolt and eventually led to the trial and execution of Charles I for treason. The final stage of the English Civil War came in 1649, and lasted until 1651. This time, King Charles II, the son of Charles I led supporters against Parliament. The Battle of Worcester, which took place in 1651, marked the end of the English Civil War. Charles II and other royalist forces were defeated by Parliamentarians and their leader Oliver Cromwell. This war began to take England in different directions regarding religious and political beliefs as well as economic and social. Also, the war constitutionally established that no British monarch was permitted to rule without first having been approved by Parliament.\n\nThe Anglo-Dutch War was a naval conflict between England and the Dutch Republic from 1652 to 1654 and was over the competition in commercial maritime and was focused mainly in the East Indies.<ref name=\"http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_anglodutch1.html.\"></ref> The first Navigation Act, which forbade the import of goods unless they were transported either in English vessels or by vessels from the country of origin. This was a policy aimed against the Dutch, and fighting broke out on May 19, 1652 with a small skirmish between Dutch and English fleets. The War officially began in July and fighting continued for two years. The Battle of Scheveningen which is also referred to as Texel was the end of serious fighting in the war and took place in July 1653.<ref name=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/25010/Anglo-Dutch-Wars.|accessdate=2009-4-11\"> Dutch and English fleets numbering over one hundred ships fought for twelve hours resulting in over 1,600 men killed, including Admiral Tromp for the Dutch and only half that number for the English.</ref> The Treaty of Westminster was signed in April 1654 ending the war and obligated the Dutch Republic to respect the Navigation Act as well as compensate England for the war.\n\nThe French and Indian War was between the nations of Great Britain and France, along with the numerous Native American Nations allied with both. The French and Indian war was the North American theater of the Seven Years' War being fought in Europe at the time. Growing population in British territory throughout North America forced expansion west; however, this was met with resistance from the French and their Native American allies. French forces began entering British territory, building numerous forts in preparation to defend the newly acquired land. The beginning of the war favored the French and their Native American allies, who were able to defeat British forces time and again, and it was not until 1756 that the British were able to hold off their opposition. Pittsburgh was a center for fighting during the French and Indian War, namely because of the geographical location at the center where three rivers unite: the Allegheny, the Monongahela and the Ohio. The location of present-day Pittsburgh provided an advantage in naval control. Ownership of this point provided not only naval dominance, but it also expanded economic ventures, enabling shipments to be sent and received with relative ease. French and British forces both claimed ownership to this region; the French installing Fort Duquesne and the British with Fort Pitt. Fort Pitt was established in 1758 after French forces abandoned and destroyed Fort Duquesne. The French and Indian War came to an end in 1763, after British forces were able to secure Quebec and Montreal from the French and on February 10, the Treaty of Paris was signed. The French were forced to surrender their territory in North America, giving England control all the way to the Mississippi River. The effects of this war were heavily felt in the North American British colonies. England imposed many taxes on colonists in order to control the newly acquired territory. These tensions would soon culminate into a war for independence as well as a shift in power for dominance in the economic world.\n\nThe American Revolutionary War was a war between the nation of England and the 13 colonies in the North American continent. This war lasted from 1775 to 1783 and began with the Battle of Bunker Hill, where over 1,150 British soldiers were killed or wounded. This equated to almost half of the entire British army that were present at the engagement. American casualties were far less severe, totaling an estimated at 450 killed and wounded. The British, however, were able to take the ground and push the newly formed Continental Army back to the city of Boston, which also soon fell to British forces. Before the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battles of Lexington and Concord in April, 1775, saw British troops begin their assault into the American colonies. British troops were searching for colonist supply depots, however, were met by heavy resistance and the British forces were turned around at Concord by outnumbering Minutemen forces. On July 4, 1776 the Declaration of Independence was signed by the Second Continental Congress and officially declared the colonies of North America to be a sovereign nation, free from England’s rule. Also, the Congress permitted funding for a Continental Army, which is the first instance of an American political body handling military affairs. The British were dominating in the beginning of the war, holding off Continental regulars and militia and gaining vast amounts of territory throughout North America. However, the tide began to turn for the colonists in 1777 with their first major victory over British forces at the Battle of Saratoga. Victory for the rest of the war pushed back and forth between the British and colonists, but the alliance with France in 1778 by the American colonists leveled the playing field and aided in the final push for the defeat of the British Army and Navy. In 1781, American and French forces were able to trap the escaping southern British Army at Yorktown, thus ending the major fighting of the Revolution. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1783, and recognized the American colonies as an independent nation. The newly formed United States would undergo numerous transitions to becoming one of the top economic and military powers in the world.\n\nMuch of the trading during the proto-globalization time period was regulated by Europe. Globalization from an economic standpoint relied on the East India Company. The East India Company was a number of enterprises formed in western Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, initially created to further trade in the East Indies. The company controlled trading from India to East and Southeast Asia.\n\nOne of the key contributors to globalization was the \"Triangular Trade\" and how it connected the world. The Triangular Trade or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three areas of the world through trade. Once traded, items and goods were shipped to other parts of the world, making the triangle trade a key to global trade. The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.\n\nEuropeans would sail to the West African coast and trade African kings manufactured goods (rifles and ammunition) for slave. From there slaves would be sent to the West Indies or the east coast of North America to be used for labor. Goods such as cotton, molasses, sugar, tobacco would be sent from these places back to Europe. Europe would also use their goods and trade with Asian countries for tea, cloth and spices. The triangle trade in a sense was an agreement for established trade routes, that led to greater global integration, which ultimately contributed to globalization.\n\nAlong with the control Europe gained, as far as global trade, came several treaties and laws. In 1773, the Regulating Act was passed, regulating affairs of the company in India and London. In 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the War of the Austrian Succession, but failed to settle the commercial struggle between England and France in the West Indies, Africa and India. The treaty was an attempt at regulating trade and market expansion between the two regions, but was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nGlobalization at this time was hindered by war, diseases and population growth in certain areas. The Corn Laws were established to regulate imports and exports of grains in England, thus restricting trade and the expansion of globalization. The Corn Crop Laws hindered the market economy and globalization based on tariffs and import restrictions. Eventually, the Ricardian theory of economics became prominent and allowed for improved trade regulations, specifically with Portugal.\n\nAccording to Sebastian Conrad, proto-globalization is marked with a “rise of national chauvinism, racism, Social Darwinism, and genocidal thinking” which came to be with relations to the “establishment of a world economy”.\nBeginning in the 1870s, the global trade cycle started to cement itself so that more nations' economies depended on one another than in any previous era. Domino effects in this new world trade cycle lead to both worldwide recessions and world economic booms. Modelski describes the late period of proto-globalization as a \"thick range of global networks extending throughout the world at high speed and covering all components of society\". By the 1750s, Europe, Africa, Asia, and America's contact had grown into a stable multilateral interdependency which was echoed in the modern globalization period.\n\nAlthough the North Atlantic World dominated the global system before proto-globalization, a more \"multipolar global economy\" started taking form around the early 19th century, and capital was becoming highly mobile. By the end of the 19th century, British capital wealth was 17% overseas, and the level of capital invested overseas nearly doubled by 1913 to 33%. Germany invested one-fifth of their total domestic savings in 1880, and, like Britain, increased their wealth tremendously in the early 20th century. The net foreign investment of total domestic savings abroad was 35% in 1860, 47% in 1880, and 53% in the years prior to the Great War. Global investments were taking a steady rise throughout societies, and those able to invest thrust more and more of their domestic savings into international investments.\n\nThe ability to mobilize capital was due to the development of the Industrial Revolution and the beginnings of mechanical production (most prominent in Great Britain). During proto-globalization, \"merchant capitalists in many societies quickly became aware of potential markets and new producers and began to link them together in new patterns of world trade. The expansion of the slave production and the exploitation of the Americas put Europeans on the top of the economic network. During the modern globalization period, mass production allowed the development of a stronger, more complex global network of trade. Another element of European success between 1750 and 1850 was the limitation and \"relative 'failure'\" of the Afro-Asian Industrial Revolution. The movement into modern globalization was marked with the economic drain of capital into Europe.\n\nLike capital, the end of proto-globalization was filled with mobility of individuals. The time of proto-globalization was one filled with “mutual influence, hybridization, and cross-cultural entanglement”. Many historians blame this web of national entanglements and agreements as the cause for the intensity and vast involvement during World War I. Between 1750-1880, the expansion of worldwide integration was influenced by the new capacities in production, transportation, and communication.\nThe end of proto-globalization also marked the final phase of \"great domestication\". After the 1650s, the process of regular and intensive agrarian exploitation was complete. Human population began to increase almost exponentially with the end of the great pandemics. At the end of the proto-globalization and the cusp of modern globalization, population began to \"recover in Central and South America,\" where at the beginning of proto-globalization, European-imported illnesses had savagely decreased indigenous populations. The importation of nutritious varieties from Central and South America created a more fertile and resilient population to forge ahead into modern globalization. The greater population pushed individuals in high populated areas to \"spill into less populous forested and grazing lands, and bring them under cultivation\". This development lead to an influx in produce production and exported trade.\nAnother development that lead to the shift to modern globalization was the development of a more politicized system. Proto-globalization period marked a steady expansion of larger states from the Indonesian islands to northern Scandinava. The settlement of these individuals made it easier for governments to tax, develop an army, labor force, and create a sustainable economy. The development and streamlining of these cultural aspects lead to an increase in peripheral players in the game of globalization. The stable legal institutions developed in the late proto-globalization and early modern globalization period established economic advances, intellectual property rights (more predominantly in England), general geographical stability, and generational societal improvement.\nThe shift in exchange of technological advancements was another reason for modern globalization. In the early 19th century, European civilizations traveled the world to accumulate an \"impressive knowledge about languages, religions, customs, and political orders of other countries. By the end of the 19th century, Europe was no longer receiving any significant technological innovations from Asia.\n\nThe developed global networks lead to the creation of new networks leading to new production. By 1880, there was a renewed thrust of European colonial expansion. The shift to modern globalization was slow, overlapping and interacting. Mid-19th century, noncompeting goods were exchanged between continents and markets for widely used commodities developed. Also, labor was becoming globally integrated. Modern globalization came to be as the movement of general expansion of socio-economic networks became more elaborate. An example of this is the development and establishment of free masonry. The \"existing trading networks grew, capital and commodity flows intensified. The permanence of long-term interdependencies was unchanged. By the beginning of the modern globalization period, the European colonial expansion retreats into itself. National societies began to regret the economic integration and attempted to limit the effects. Bayly, Hopkins and others stress that proto-globalization's transformation into modern globalization was a complex process that took place at different times in different regions,and involved the hold-over of older notions of value and rarity which had their origins in the pre-modern period. Thus leading to the age of economic deglobalization and world wars which ended after 1945.\n\n\n\n"}

Liberation theology is a school of theology within Christianity, particularly in the Catholic Church. It emphasizes the Christian mission to bring justice to the poor and oppressed, particularly through political activism. Its theologians consider sin the root source of poverty, the sin in question being exploitative capitalism and class war by the rich against the poor. In the United States, the Social Gospel was pursued in response to increased ideas of capitalist ideas and social Darwinism, calling on protections of people against perceived threats from industrialization.\n\nUsury or riba is prohibited and religious law encourages the use of capital to spur economic activity while placing the burden of risk along with the benefit of profit with the owner of the capital. A 2.5% alms tax (\"zakat\") is levied on all gold, crops and cattle.\n\nSayyid Qutb denounced capitalism in \"The Battle Between Islam and Capitalism\", published in 1951. The Islamic constitution of Iran which was drafted by mostly Islamic clerics (see the Assembly of Experts) dispraises the \"materialist schools of thought\" that encourage \"concentration and accumulation of wealth and maximization of profit\". Malcolm X was also critical of capitalism.\n"}

It was built by Leşker Emir Celaleddin Ali in 1231–1232 during the reign of Anatolian Seljuk Sultan Kayqubad I (r. 1220–1237). It saw later two restorations, in 1275 by Eminüddin Mikail bin Abdullah, the regent of Kaykhusraw III (r. 1265–1284), and in 1440 by Hızır Bey, a judge in Sivrihisar and later the first judge in Istanbul. The mosque is a rare example of wooden-columned architectural technique in Anatolia together with four others.\n\nThe ground area of the mosque is . It has a rectangular plan. The outer walls are of ashlar. It has four entrances. Marble inscriptions showing the historical restoration dates are found on the northern and eastern gates. The roof is covered by tiles, which were replaced by lead sheet not long ago. The roof is carried by 67 wooden columns in the inside, of which upper parts are decorated by painted mostly in green, red and black colors engravings of traditional figures. Some columns stand on stone base having ancient column head. It is likely that the stone columns heads originate from Pessinus, an ancient city known as Ballıhisar today close to Sivrihisar. There are six naves in east-west direction. The middle naves are higher than the others resembling the historic Turkic tents used in the nomadic era the Central Asia. The mosque's minbar, the pulpit, is a masterwork made by Horasanlı İbni Mehmet in 1245, and is famous for its ornaments in geometrical and floral design engraved in walnut wood. It is believed that the minbar was broght here from the Sivrihisar Kılıç Masjid, which was demolished in 1924.

It is housed in the National Museum of San Marco, Florence, central Italy.\n\nThe tabernacle was commissioned for the exterior of the seat of the Linaioli (the guild of linen workers in Florence), in the former Old Market, in the October 1432. The marble parts were executed by Simone di Nanni da Fiesole, under design by Lorenzo Ghiberti. The contract for the internal paintings was signed by Angelico on 2 July 1433, for a total of 190 golden florins. The predella is generally dated to 1433-1435.\n\nThe work was a large one, comparable only to Cimabue's Santa Trinita Maestà or Duccio di Buoninsegna's \"Rucellai Madonna\". It has been speculated that the marble frame was sized according to a pre-existing painting, which was later replaced by Fra Angelico's, or that the size was inspired by that of the statues in Orsanmichele niches.\n\nWork had been moved to the Palazzo della Borsa as early as 1777, together with other works commissioned by the city's guilds. In that year it was transferred to the Uffizi, whence it was transferred to the current location in 1924.\n\nThe tabernacle was restored in 2010.\n\nThe tabernacle is composed of a rectangular marble frame, with a triangular top with a sculpted almond depicting the \"Blessing Christ and Cherubims\". In the center, within an arched opening, are Fra Angelico's panel of the \"Maestà\" with twelve musician angels. \n\nAt the front are two shutter panels with further paintings of saints. These are, internally, St. John the Baptist (left) and St. John the Evangelist (right); and externally St. Mark the Evangelist (left) and St. Peter (right). The panels are completed by a predella, placed below, with three scenes of \"St. Peter Dictating the Gospel to St. Mark\", \"Adoration of the Magi\" and \"Martyrdom of St. Mark\". The figure of Mark is recurrent due to his status as the patron of the corporation which commissioned the work.\n\nThe central panel, although damaged, has a style similar to Angelico's early works, with a marble step over which is the throne. Behind two draperies (perhaps a hint to the guild's textile activities) is a ceiling painted in blue with stars and the Holy Spirit dove, which is similar to Masolino's \"Annunciation\" in Washington, DC.\n\n"}

It discusses the genre of English saucy seaside postcards that were sold mostly in small shops in British coastal towns, and particularly the work of its prime exponent, Donald McGill. Orwell notes the role of this type of humour as a rebellion against convention in society and states that, despite the vulgarity, he would be sorry to see the postcards vanish.\n\nSeaside postcards represent the low humour and wordplay that was characteristic of the Victorian music hall. They were sold by newsagents and at booths along the front at British seaside holiday resorts.\n\nMcGill created an estimated 12,000 of the colour washed drawings which were then reproduced as postcards and an estimated 200 million were printed and sold. His career began in 1904 when he was encouraged by a relation who saw an illustrated get-well card McGill had made for a sick nephew. Within a year it was his full-time occupation. McGill studied art and married the daughter of the owner of Crowder's Music Hall in Greenwich. Such postcards were associated with embarrassment and McGill noted that his two daughters \"ran like stags whenever they passed a comic postcard shop\".\n\nOrwell's interest in such postcards began in his schooldays in Eastbourne. Jacintha Buddicom recalls him around the age of twelve at Shiplake and Henley when he kept a collection in an album. She recalls that some were kept in a manilla envelope because they were \"too vulgar\" to be put on display. In \"Such, Such Were the Joys\" Orwell reports his alarm at being stared at with suspicion by a man as he came out a newsagent's shop in Eastbourne, although he says in the essay that he was buying sweets.\n\n\"The Art of Donald McGill\" was first published in \"Horizon\" in September 1941. The article has appeared in many anthologies including \"Critical Essays\" (1946), \"Collected Essays\" (1961), \"Decline of the English Murder and Other Essays\" (1965) and \"The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell\" (1968), republished by the Donald McGill Museum & Archive Ryde (2010) with for the first time examples of the cards discussed accompanying the text.\n\nOrwell identifies the overpowering vulgarity, the crude drawing and unbearable colours of the seaside postcard which specialises in very 'low' humour. He selects McGill because he sees his work as the most representative and perfect in the tradition, although he is ignorant of whether McGill is a real individual or just a corporate name.\n\nOrwell picks out the main subjects of the postcards as sex, home life, drunkenness, WC jokes, snobbery within the working-class, stereotypical figures and topical politico-social fads. They feature illegitimacy, the mother-in-law, the hen-pecked husband, the middle-aged drunk, chamber pots, the nervous clergyman who says the wrong thing, malapropisms and \"an endless succession of fat women in tight bathing-dresses.\" He concludes that this reflects, on a comic level, the working-class outlook that youth and adventure, and even individual life, end with marriage.\n\nOrwell considers that in England under censorship laws there is a wide gap between what can be said and what can be printed. He sees comic post cards as the only medium in which really \"low\" humour is printable although similar jokes are part and parcel of the revue and music-hall, and can be heard on the radio.\n\nOrwell presents a thesis of duality in human nature which he calls the Don Quixote–Sancho Panza combination—the conflict between high-minded respectability and vulgar buffoonery. \"Society has always to demand a little more from human beings than it will get in practice—that they should work hard, pay their taxes, and be faithful to their wives, men should think it glorious to die on the battlefield and women should want wear themselves out with child-bearing. The postcards represent the worm's-eye view of life where \"marriage is a dirty joke or a comic disaster... where the lawyer is always a crook and the Scotsman always a miser, where the newly-weds make fools of themselves on the hideous beds of seaside lodging-houses and the drunken, red-nosed husbands roll home at four in the morning to meet the linen-nightgowned wives who wait for them behind the front door, poker in hand\". Orwell brings in a quotation from Ecclesiastes (vii 15).\n\nSuch postcards are therefore symptomatically important as a sort of saturnalia, a harmless rebellion against virtue. Orwell notes that the mood of the comic post card could appear between the murders in Shakespeare's tragedies but that this type of humour in literature had been repressed from the beginning of the 19th century and has dwindled to these \"ill-drawn post cards, leading a barely legal existence in cheap stationers' windows\".\n\nIn 1954, under a government crackdown on declining morals, McGill was prosecuted and fined under the Obscene Publications Act 1857. This almost wiped out the industry. In 1957 he gave evidence to a House of Commons Select Committee which was revising the legislation.\n\nIn the light of an exhibition of the work of McGill in 2004, various critics have challenged Orwell's dismissive view of the quality of the art.\n\n\n"}

The film co-stars Samuel L. Jackson. It was the duo's second collaboration, after the 2000 film \"Rules of Engagement\". The film was based on the play of the same name by Cormac McCarthy.\nBlack and White converse about White's attempted suicide. White feels as though everything ends up in death, and that his life is minuscule in the throes of time.\n\nFrom White's point of view, no matter how great someone or something is, all that is created eventually fades away. This is the opposite of what Black believes. He believes that there is a God and that we all must go through the troubles of life to get to paradise (Heaven). By his own account, his story is that of a man who has committed murder and was far away from God, but has now changed.\n\nBlack feels that he can persuade White from committing suicide. With Black stopping White right before he was about to kill himself, Black feels that this is destiny. In the end, Black is not able to persuade White from suicide; he lets him leave the apartment. When White leaves, Black is left pondering why God would put him in a position to save this man's life knowing that there is nothing that he can do to stop White from going through with the suicide.\n\n\nThe film received generally favorable reviews. The film holds a 67-out-of-100 score at the review aggregator website Metacritic, based on 15 reviews.

Delporte writes of 29 figurines altogether. They are about 20,000 years old and stem from the Gravettian. Most of these statuettes show stylized clothes. Quite often the face is depicted. They were discovered at Mal'ta, at the Angara River, near Lake Baikal in Irkutsk Oblast, Siberia by the archeologists , , and Mikhail Gerasimov.\n\nThese figurines are on display at the Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg.\n\nAround 30 female statuettes of varying shapes were discovered at Mal'ta, at the Angara River, and near Lake Baikal in Irkutsk Oblast in Siberia. The wide variety of forms, combined with the realism of the sculptures and the lack of repetitiveness in detail, are definite signs of developed, albeit early, art.\n\nUntil the Mal’ta find, Venus figurines were previously found only in Europe. Carved from the tusk ivory of a mammoth, these images were typically highly stylized and often involved embellished and disproportionate characteristics (typically the breasts or buttocks).\n\nAt first glance what is obvious is that the Mal'ta Venus figurines are of two types: full-figured women with exaggerated forms, and women with a thin, delicate form. Some of the figures are nude while others have etchings that seem to indicate fur or clothing. Conversely, unlike those found in Europe, some of the Venus figurines from Mal’ta were sculpted with faces. Most of the figurines were tapered at the bottom, and it is believed that this was done so they could have been stuck into the ground or placed upright some other way. Placed upright they could have symbolized the spirits of the dead, akin to \"spirit dolls\" used nearly world-wide, including Siberia, among contemporary people.\n\nThe suggested similarity between Mal'ta and Upper Paleolithic civilizations of Western and Eastern Europe coincides with a long-held belief that the ancient people of Mal'ta were related to the Paleolithic societies of Europe. These similarities can be established by their tools, dwelling structures, and art. These commonalities draw into question the origin of Upper Paleolithic Siberian people, and whether the migrating peoples originated from Southeastern Asia or quite possibly from Europe. On the other hand, one can argue that as a group the Mal'ta Venus figures are rather different from the female figurines of Western and Central Europe. For example, none of the Siberian specimens indicates abdominal enlargement as main European examples do, and as breasts are often lacking, few offer clear enough evidence of gender to define them as female. More conclusively, nearly half of them show some facial details, something which is lacking on the so-called Venus figures of Europe.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "540571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=540571", "title": "Wernicke's area", "text": "Wernicke's area\n\nWernicke's area ( or ; ), also called Wernicke's speech area, is one of the two parts of the cerebral cortex that are linked to speech (the other is Broca's area). It is involved in the comprehension or understanding of written and spoken language (in contrast to Broca's area that is involved in the production of language). It is traditionally thought to be in Brodmann area 22, which is located in the superior temporal lobe in the dominant cerebral hemisphere (which is the left hemisphere in about 95% of right handed individuals and 60% of left handed individuals). Damage caused to Wernicke's area results in receptive, fluent aphasia. This means that the person with aphasia will be able to fluently connect words, but the phrases will lack meaning. This is unlike non-fluent aphasia, in which the person will use meaningful words, but in a non-fluent, telegraphic manner.\n\nWernicke's area is classically located in the posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in the (most commonly) left cerebral hemisphere. This area encircles the auditory cortex on the lateral sulcus (the part of the brain where the temporal lobe and parietal lobe meet). This area is neuroanatomically described as the posterior part of Brodmann area 22.\n\nHowever, there is an absence of consistent definitions as to the location. Some identify it with the unimodal auditory association in the superior temporal gyrus anterior to the primary auditory cortex (the anterior part of BA 22). This is the site most consistently implicated in auditory word recognition by functional brain imaging experiments. Others include also adjacent parts of the heteromodal cortex in BA 39 and BA40 in the parietal lobe.\n\nWhile previously thought to connect Wernicke's area and Broca's area, new research demonstrates that the arcuate fasciculus instead connects to posterior receptive areas with premotor/motor areas, and not to Broca's area. Consistent with the word recognition site identified in brain imaging, the uncinate fasciculus connects anterior superior temporal regions with Broca's area.\n\nResearch using Transcranial magnetic stimulation suggests that the area corresponding to the Wernicke’s area in the non-dominant cerebral hemisphere has a role in processing and resolution of subordinate meanings of ambiguous words—such as ‘‘river’’ when given the ambiguous word \"bank.\" In contrast, the Wernicke's area in the dominant hemisphere processes dominant word meanings (‘‘teller’’ given ‘‘bank’’).\n\nNeuroimaging suggests the functions earlier attributed to Wernicke's area occur more broadly in the temporal lobe and indeed happen also in Broca's area.\n\nSupport for a broad range of speech processing areas was furthered by a recent study done at University of Rochester in which American Sign Language native speakers were subject to MRIs while interpreting sentences that identified a relationship using either syntax (relationship is determined by the word order) or inflection (relationship is determined by physical motion of \"moving hands through space or signing on one side of the body\"). Distinct areas of the brain were activated with the frontal cortex (associated with ability to put information into sequences) being more active in the syntax condition and the temporal lobes (associated with dividing information into its constituent parts) being more active in the inflection condition. However, these areas are not mutually exclusive and show a large amount of overlap. These findings imply that while speech processing is a very complex process, the brain may be using fairly basic, preexisting computational methods.\n\nWernicke's area is named after Carl Wernicke, a German neurologist and psychiatrist who, in 1874, hypothesized a link between the left posterior section of the superior temporal gyrus and the reflexive mimicking of words and their syllables that associated the sensory and motor images of spoken words. He did this on the basis of the location of brain injuries that caused aphasia. Receptive aphasia in which such abilities are preserved is also known as Wernicke's aphasia. In this condition there is a major impairment of language comprehension, while speech retains a natural-sounding rhythm and a relatively normal syntax. Language as a result is largely meaningless (a condition sometimes called \"fluent\" or \"jargon aphasia\").\n\nWhile neuroimaging and lesion evidence generally support the idea that malfunction of or damage to Wernicke's area is common in people with receptive aphasia, this is not always so. Some people may use the right hemisphere for language, and isolated damage of Wernicke's area cortex (sparing white matter and other areas) may not cause severe receptive aphasia. Even when patients with Wernicke's area lesions have comprehension deficits, these are usually not restricted to language processing alone. For example, one study found that patients with posterior lesions also had trouble understanding nonverbal sounds like animal and machine noises. In fact, for Wernicke's area, the impairments in nonverbal sounds were statistically stronger than for verbal sounds.\n"}
