When it occurs prior to acquisition, the appraisal process involves assessing records for inclusion in the archives. In connection with an institution's collecting policy, appraisal \"represents a doorway into the archives through which all records must pass.\" Some considerations when conducting appraisal include how to meet the record-granting body’s organizational needs, how to uphold requirements of organizational accountability (be they legal, institutional, or determined by archival ethics), and how to meet the expectations of the record-using community.\n\nAppraisal is considered a core archival function, along with acquisition, arrangement and description, preservation and access. The official definition from the Society of American Archivists is as follows:\n\nIn an archival context, appraisal is the process of determining whether records and other materials have permanent (archival) value. Appraisal may be done at the collection, creator, series, file, or item level. Appraisal can take place prior to donation and prior to physical transfer, at or after accessioning. The basis of appraisal decisions may include a number of factors, including the records' provenance and content, their authenticity and reliability, their order and completeness, their condition and costs to preserve them, and their intrinsic value. Appraisal often takes place within a larger institutional collecting policy and mission statement.Appraisal can be viewed as a balancing act between the demands of administrative and heritage objectives; between the context of creation and the use of records. Depending on the degree of her or his autonomy to make appraisal decisions, an archivist's role is more or less central to the \"memory\" of an institution or society. Jacques Grimard sees archivists as participating in the \"management of the world's memory\" in three ways, by developing, preserving and communicating memory. In Luciana Duranti's view, appraisal is an analogue for the archival profession as a whole. It is the duty of the profession to \"act as a mediator between those who produce archives and those who use them, as a facilitator of public memory making and keeping.\" She is cautious in her use of the term \"value\" in the context of archives, if establishing value means compromising the relationships between documents and the \"impartial societal evidence\" they might convey to future generations. \n\nMostly concerned with the records of government bodies, the \"Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives: Drawn up by the Netherlands Association of Archivists\" (1898), commonly referred to as the \"Dutch Manual,\" assumed, generally, that the archives would keep each record it acquired. The authors articulated concepts of provenance and original order that privileged an \"organic bond\" in a collection that precedes its transfer to an archival repository. Appraisal decisions that involve selecting individual records or groups of records for exclusion would consequently lie outside the responsibilities of the archivist, in their view.\nSir Hilary Jenkinson was a British archivist and Deputy Keeper of the Public Record Office upon his retirement. His great contribution to appraisal theory is his \"Manual of Archive Administration\" (1922; revised 1937; reissued 1965) in which he argued that archives are \"documents which formed part of an official transaction and were preserved for official reference\". For Jenkinson, the records creator is responsible for determining which records should be transferred to the archives for preservation. Since in his view records are \"impartial\", the task of selection is merely a matter of choosing documents that best describe \"what happened\".\n\nJenkinson staked out a limited role for the archivist, positioned between the administrative body transferring the records and the researcher who might seek to access them. The archivist, according to Jenkinson, is to act as a steward of the records in his or her custody. Neither the archivist nor the historian is competent to make appraisal decisions. That process should be left to the donor. Jenkinson deals directly with destruction of records, which he sees as solely the purview of the creator of those records. As long as destruction is done in accordance with the needs of its \"practical business\" and the agency of origin refrains \"from thinking of itself as a body producing historical evidence\", its actions should not, in Jenkinson's view, be considered illegitimate, even by succeeding generations.\n\nT. R. Schellenberg's work in \"Modern Archives\" (1956) represents a departure from Jenkinson’s approach, necessitated by the advent of mass duplication and an overwhelming influx of documents into archives. In his work, he divides the value of records into primary values (the original value for the creator; for their administrative, fiscal, and operating uses) and secondary values (their lasting value after they are no longer in current use; for those other than the original creator). He defines evidential value as deriving from the \"evidence records contain of the organization and functioning of the Government body that produced them\", and informational value as related to the \"information records contain on persons, corporate bodies, things, problems, conditions, and the like, with which the Government body dealt\". After defining the terms, Schellenberg details the manner in which an archivist could perform appraisal based on these criteria, placing a stress in every case on the importance of research and analysis on the part of the archivist. \n\nAccording to Schellenberg, informational value is based on three criteria:\n\n\nAccording to Terry Cook, North American appraisal theory is unplanned, taxonomic, random and fragmented, and has rarely embodied the concepts of institutional and societal dynamics which would lead archivists to a working model that would allow them to appraise the broad spectrum of human experience. His model is a top-down approach, which focuses on key processes through which a particular function is expressed by intersecting with structures and individuals. \n\nMacro-appraisal is distinguished from \"micro\"-appraisal in that the former seeks to \"appraise\" the institution by understanding the context of creation and the interrelationships between, for instance, the different ministries or agencies within a government. In Cook's view, this institutional understanding should precede and inform the latter, micro-appraisal; the appraisal of documents. His approach to macro-appraisal doesn't just derive from the position of the creating body within an established hierarchy. It is not \"top-down\" in a conventional, bureaucratic sense. It is top-down in that it moves from macro to micro-appraisal.\n\nThis requires a planned, logical approach—archivists embarking upon appraisals are equipped with an understanding of the record creator, its mandate and functions, its structure and decision-making processes, the way it creates records, and changes to these processes over time.\n\nThe benefits of this process are theoretical (identifying the important functions in society which should be documented) and practical (the ability to focus appraisal activities on records of the highest potential archival value).\n\nConnected with the writings of Helen Willa Samuels, documentation strategy aims to reach beyond institutional frameworks when appraising collections. In the past, she says, archivists have been passive, concentrating on researchers’ needs rather than understanding a document in context. This has led to a circular problem, as researchers state their needs based on the context that they deduce from the archives, and as the archives create an artificial context based on researchers’ stated needs. \"Archivists are challenged to select a lasting record\", Samuels says, \"but they lack techniques to support this decision making\" (1992). Samuels argues that while archivists once needed to know and understand the complex bureaucratic structures of organizations, they must now understand the structures between organizations and ignore institutional boundaries.\n\nHowever, this is increasingly impossible; archivists need to examine documentation in a comprehensive manner. A documentation strategy is, then, \"a plan formulated to assure the documentation of an ongoing issue, activity or geographic area\" (ibid). Its development includes records creators, archivists, and users, and it is carried out through a system-wide understanding of the intended life-cycle of the record.\n\n\n"}

It features elaborate plaster facades dating to the Early Classic period. It has one of the largest surviving stucco friezes in the Maya world. Balamku was first occupied from around 300 BC. Its most important buildings date from AD 300–600. \nBalamku is located north of the ruins of the great Maya city of Calakmul, approximately the same distance west of Becan, west of Xpujil and southeast of the ruins of Nadzca'an. The ruins lie upon a poorly drained karstic plateau. \n\nThe architectural style of Balamku has more in common with the Petén tradition to the south, although Río Bec influences are also evident.\n\nBalamku was occupied from about 300 BC, in the Late Preclassic, through to the Terminal Classic period, between 800 and 1000 AD. The earliest architecture in the site is found in the Central and South Groups, dating to the Late Preclassic to Early Classic transition.\n\nThe ruins were discovered in 1990 by Mexican archaeologist Florentino García Cruz in the company of INAH custodians, when they investigated a report of archaeological looting; they found a looters' trench that had partly uncovered a painted stucco frieze that had originally formed part of the upper facade of an Early Classic building. After initial rescue work, the site was formally excavated in 1994 to 1995 by a team headed by Mexican archaeologist Ramón Carrasco and including two French archaeologists, Claude Baudez and Jean Pierre Courau. Carrasco and his Mexican team concentrated on the Central Group while the French archaeologists investigated the South Group.\n\nThe ruins of Balamku cover an area of approximately . The site features a very low density of peripheral architecture around the principal groups; by away there are practically no further buildings.\n\nThe ruins are distributed in four major architectural groups. The Central and North Groups are situated close to water sources.\n\nThe Central Group comprises three plazas, labelled as Plaza A, B and C.\n\nPlaza A is situated at the southern extreme of the Central Group. It supports a Mesoamerican ballcourt and a number of mounds that have not yet been investigated archaeologically.\n\nPlaza B is located in the northwestern sector of the Central Group. It is enclosed by Structure I on the north side, Structure IV on the south side, and structures V and VI on the east and west sides respectively. Test pits have uncovered architectural remains dating back to the Late Preclassic, the earliest phase of operation at the site.\n\nPlaza C is separated from Plaza B by Structure V. It is bordered by Structure II on its north side and Structure III on its west side. It is enclosed on its south side by a number of unexcavated structures.\n\nThe South Group comprises four plazas, labelled A through to D.\n\nPlaza A is enclosed by Structure D5-5 on its north side. Structure D5-10 limits its western side and Structure D5-11 encloses it on the south side.\n\nPlaza B has Structure D5-5 on its eastern side. Structure D5-10 is on the south side of the plaza and Structure D5-7 encloses the northern side of the plaza.\n\nPlaza C is bordered by Structure D5-4 and Structure D5-6 on its east and south sides respectively.\n\nPlaza D is enclosed by Structure D5-1 on its eastern side. Structure D5-2 limits the south side of the plaza and Structure D5-3 closes the plaza on the west side.\n\nThe Southwest Group consists of two structures that together form an E-Group astronomical complex.\n\nThe North Group has not been excavated by archaeologists although it has been mapped. It consists of six plazas bordered by structures, some of which over tall.\n\nStructure I is located in the Central Group. Excavations of an earlier substructure (Sub I-A) have uncovered a stucco frieze stylistically dated to between the 4th century BC and the middle of the 6th century AD, although radiocarbon dating of the lintel of the structure returned a date of 631 AD ± 30 years. The frieze was first uncovered by looters and was fully excavated under the direction of INAH. The complete frieze measured long when excavated and stood high. The frieze combines imagery of rulers with that of a sacred mountain. The frieze preserved almost intact; it is protected by roofing and is accessible to visitors.\n\nStructure D5-5 is located in the South Group between plazas B and C. Two burials were excavated in the structure, one of them was an elite status individual.\n\nStructure D5-10, in the South Group, is built over two earlier structures dating to the Late Preclassic.\n\nStructure D5-11 is located in the South Group, on the south side of Plaza A. It dates as far back as the Late Preclassic and is one of the earliest known buildings at Balamku.\n"}
{"id": "2913030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2913030", "title": "Book size", "text": "Book size\n\nThe size of a book is generally measured by the height against the width of a leaf, or sometimes the height and width of its cover. A series of terms is commonly used by libraries and publishers for the general sizes of modern books, ranging from \"folio\" (the largest), to \"quarto\" (smaller) and \"octavo\" (still smaller). Historically, these terms referred to the format of the book, a technical term used by printers and bibliographers to indicate the size of a leaf in terms of the size of the original sheet. For example, a quarto (from Latin \"quartō\", ablative form of \"quartus\", fourth) historically was a book printed on a sheet of paper folded twice to produce four leaves (or eight pages), each leaf one fourth the size of the original sheet printed. Because the actual format of many modern books cannot be determined from examination of the books, bibliographers may not use these terms in scholarly descriptions.\n\nIn the hand press period (up to about 1820) books were manufactured by printing text on both sides of a full sheet of paper and then folding the paper one or more times into a group of leaves or \"gathering\". The binder would sew the gatherings (sometimes also called \"signatures\") through their inner hinges and attached to cords in the spine to form the book block. Before the covers were bound to the book, the block of text pages was sometimes trimmed along the three unbound edges to open the folds of the paper and to produce smooth edges for the book. When the leaves were not trimmed, the reader would have to cut open the leaf edges using a knife.\n\nBooks made by printing two pages of text on each side of a sheet of paper, which is then folded once to form two leaves or four pages, are referred to as \"folios\" (from Latin, \"foliō\", ablative of \"folium\", leaf). Those made by printing four text pages on each side of a sheet of paper and folding the paper twice to form a gathering containing four leaves or eight pages are called \"quartos\" (fourths). Similarly, books made by printing eight pages of text on each side of a sheet, which was then folded three times to form gatherings of eight leaves or sixteen pages each, are called \"octavos\". The size of the resulting pages in these cases depends, of course, on the size of the full sheet used to print them and how much the leaves were trimmed before binding, but where the same size paper is used, folios are the largest, followed by quartos and then octavos. The proportion of leaves of quartos tends to be squarer than that of folios or octavos.\n\nThese various production methods are referred to as the format of the book. These terms are often abbreviated, using 4to for quarto, 8vo for octavo, and so on. The octavo format, with eight leaves per gathering, has half the page size of the quarto format before trimming. Smaller formats include the \"duodecimo\" (or \"twelvemo\"), with twelve leaves per sheet and pages one-third the size of the quarto format, and the \"sextodecimo\" (or \"sixteenmo\"), with sixteen leaves per sheet, half the size of the octavo format and one quarter the size of the quarto. The vast majority of books were printed in the folio, quarto, octavo or duodecimo formats.\n\nThere are many variations in how such books were produced. For example, folios were rarely made by simply binding up a group of two leaf gatherings; instead several printed leaf pairs would be inserted within another, to produce a larger gathering of multiple leaves that would be more convenient for binding. For example, three two-leaf printed sheets might be inserted in a fourth, producing gatherings of eight leaves or sixteen pages each. Bibliographers still refer to such books as folios (and not octavos) because the original full sheets were folded once to produce two leaves, and describe such gatherings as \"folios in 8s\". Similarly, a book printed as an octavo, but bound with gatherings of four leaves each, is called an \"octavo in 4s\".\n\nIn determining the format of a book, bibliographers will study the number of leaves in a gathering, their proportion and sizes and also the arrangement of the chain lines and watermarks in the paper.\n\nIn order for the pages to come out in the correct order, the printers would have to properly lay out the pages of type in the printing press. For example, to print two leaves in folio containing pages 1 through 4, the printer would print pages 1 and 4 on one side of the sheet and, after that has dried, print pages 2 and 3 on the other side. If a printer was printing a folio in 8s, as described above, he would have to print pages 1 and 16 on one side of a leaf with pages 2 and 15 on the other side of that leaf, etc. The arrangement of the pages of type in the press is referred to as the \"imposition\" and there are a number of methods of imposing pages for the various formats, some of which involve cutting the printed pages before binding.\n\nAs printing and paper technology developed, it became possible to produce and to print on much larger sheets or rolls of paper and it may not be apparent (or even possible to determine) from examination of a modern book how the paper was folded to produce them. For example, a modern novel may consist of gatherings of sixteen leaves, but may actually have been printed with sixty-four pages on each side of a very large sheet of paper. Similarly, the actual printing format cannot be determined for books that are perfect bound, where every leaf in the book is completely cut out (i.e., not conjugate to another leaf as in gatherings) and is glued into the spine. Modern books are commonly called \"folio\", \"quarto\" and \"octavo\" based simply on their size rather than the format in which they were actually produced, if that can even be determined. Scholarly bibliographers may describe such books based on the number of leaves in each gathering (eight leaves per gathering forming an octavo), even where the actual number of pages printed on the original sheet is unknown or may reject the use of these terms for modern books entirely.\n\nToday, octavo and quarto are the most common book sizes, but many books are produced in larger and smaller sizes as well. Other terms for book size have developed, an \"elephant folio\" being up to tall, an \"atlas folio\" , and a \"double elephant folio\" tall.\n\nAccording to the 2003 Guinness World Records, the largest book in the world was \"\" by Michael Hawley. Its size is . \n\nAccording to the 2007 Guinness World Records, the largest published book in the world was \"The Little Prince\" printed in Brazil in 2007. Its size is .\n\nAccording to the 2012 Guinness World Records, the largest book in the world was \"This the Prophet Mohamed\" made in Dubai, UAE. Its size is . Though larger than \"The Little Prince\", the two hold separate records, as \"This the Prophet Mohamed\" was constructed by hand, not published. \n\nThe smallest book is \"Teeny Ted from Turnip Town\" measured .\n\nThe largest surviving medieval manuscript is the \"Codex Gigas\" or 'Devil's Manuscript', measured at 92 cm tall by 50 cm wide (36 inches tall by 20 inches wide).\n\nDuring the hand press period, full sheets of paper were manufactured in a great variety of sizes which were given a number of names, such as \"pot\", \"demy\", \"foolscap\", \"crown\", etc. These were not standardized and the actual sizes varied depending on the country of manufacture and date.\n\nThe size and proportions of a book will thus depend on the size of the original sheet of paper used in producing the book. For example, if a sheet by is used to print a quarto, the resulting book will be approximately tall and wide, before trimming. Because the size of paper used has differed over the years and localities, the sizes of books of the same format will also differ. A typical octavo printed in Italy or France in the thus is roughly the size of a modern mass market paperback book, but an English octavo is noticeably larger, more like a modern trade paperback or hardcover novel.\n\nThe following table is adapted from the scale of the American Library Association, in which \"size\" refers to the dimensions of the cover (trimmed pages will be somewhat smaller, often by about or ). The words before octavo signify the traditional names for unfolded paper sheet sizes. Other dimensions may exist as well.\nA common paperback size in the UK is B-format. For example, Penguin Classics are in B-format, which is 129mm x 198mm. This contrasts with A-format (110 mm × 178 mm) and C-format (135mm x 216mm).\n\nIn book construction, Japan uses a mixture of ISO A-series, JIS B-series, and several traditional Japanese paper sizes. A- and B-series signatures are folded from a sheet slightly larger than ISO A1 and JIS B1, respectively, then trimmed to size. The most commonly encountered sizes are listed below.\n\n\nA number of imposition schemes for different formats may be found in:\n\nAdditional tables and discussion of American book formats and sizes may be found in:\n"}

Drinking horns are known from Classical Antiquity especially the Balkans, and remained in use for ceremonial purposes throughout the Middle Ages and the Early Modern period in some parts of Europe, notably in Germanic Europe, and in the Caucasus. Drinking horns remain an important accessory in the culture of ritual toasting in Georgia in particular, where they are known as \"kantsi\".\n\nDrinking vessels made from glass, wood, ceramics or metal styled in the shape of drinking horns are also known from antiquity.\nThe ancient Greek term for a drinking horn was simply \"keras\" (plural \"kerata\", \"horn\"). To be distinguished from the drinking-horn proper is the \"rhyton\" (plural \"rhyta\"), a drinking-vessel made in the shape of a horn with an outlet at the pointed end.\n\nBoth in the Greek and the Scythian sphere, vessels of clay or metal shaped like horns were used alongside actual horns from an early time.\nA Late Archaic (ca. 480 BC) Attic red-figure vase shows Dionysus and a satyr each holding a drinking horn.\n\nDuring Classical Antiquity, the Thracians and Scythians in particular were known for their custom of drinking from horns (archaeologically, the Iron Age \"Thraco-Cimmerian\" horizon).\nXenophon's account of his dealings with the Thracian leader Seuthes suggests that drinking horns were integral part of the drinking \"kata ton Thrakion nomon\" (\"after the Thracian fashion\").\nDiodorus gives an account of a feast prepared by the Getic chief Dromichaites for Lysimachus and selected captives, and the Getians' use of drinking vessels made from horn and wood is explicitly stated.\n\nThe Scythian elite also used horn-shaped \"rhyta\" made entirely from precious metal. A notable example is the 5th century BC gold-and-silver \"rhython\" in the shape of a Pegasus which was found in 1982 in Ulyap, Adygea, now at the Museum of Oriental Art in Moscow.\nM.I. Maksimova (1956) in an archaeological survey of Scythian drinking horns distinguished two basic types (excluding vessels of clearly foreign origin), a strongly curved type, and a slender type with only slight curvature; the latter type was identified as based on aurochs horns by Maksimova (1956:221). This typology became standard in Soviet-era archaeology.\nThere are a few artistic representation of Scythans actually drinking from horns from the rim (rather than from the horn's point as with \"rhyta\"). The oldest remains of drinking horns or \"rhyta\" known from Scythan burials are dated to the 7th century BC, reflecting Scythian contact with oriental culture during their raids of the Assyrian Empire at that time. After these early specimens, there is a gap with only sparse evidence of Scythian drinking horns during the 6th century. Drinking horns re-appear in the context of Pontic burials in the 5th century BC: these are the specimens classified as Scythian drinking horns by Maksimova (1956).\nThe 5th-century BC practice of depositing drinking horns with precious metal fittings as grave goods for deceased warriors appears to originate in the Kuban region. In the 4th century BC, the practice spreads throughout the Pontic Steppe. Rhyta, mostly of Achaemenid or Thracian import, continue to be found in Scythian burials, but they are now clearly outnumbered by Scythian drinking horns proper. \nAround the midpoint of the 4th century BC, a new type of solid silver drinking horn with strong curvature appears. While the slightly curving horn type is found throughout the Pontic Steppe, specimens of the new type have not been found in the Kuban area.\nThe custom of depositing drinking horns as grave goods begins to subside towards the end of the 4th century BC.\nThe depiction of drinking horns on kurgan stelae appears to follow a slightly different chronology, with the earliest examples dated to the 6th century BC, and a steep increase in frequency during the 5th, but becoming rare by the 4th century (when actual deposits of drinking horns become most frequent). In the Crimean peninsula, such depictions appear somewhat later, from the 5th century BC, but then more frequently than elsewhere.\n\nScythian drinking horns have been found almost exclusively in warrior burials. \nThis has been taken as strongly suggesting an association of the drinking horn with the \nScythian cult of kingship and warrior ethos. In the influential interpretation due to M. I. Rostovtzeff (1913), the Scythian ruler received the drinking horn from a deity as a symbol of his investiture. This interpretation is based on a number of depictions of a Scythian warrior drinking from a horn standing or kneeling next to a seated woman. Rolle (1980) interpreted the woman not as a goddess but as a high-ranking Scythian woman performing a ritual office.\nKrausse (1996) interpreted the same scenes as depicting a marriage ceremony, with\nthe man drinking from the horn as part of an oath ritual comparable to the scenes of Scythian warriors jointly drinking from a horn in an oath of blood brotherhood.\nThe Scythian drinking horns are clearly associated with the consumption of wine.\n\nThe drinking horn reached Central Europe with the Iron Age, in the wider context of \"Thraco-Cimmerian\" cultural transmission. A number of early Celtic (Hallstatt culture) specimens are known, notably the remains of a huge gold-banded horn found at the Hochdorf burial.\nKrauße (1996) examines the spread of the \"fashion\" of drinking horns (\"Trinkhornmode\") in prehistoric Europe, assuming it reached the eastern Balkans from Scythia around 500 BC. It is more difficult to assess the role of plain animal horns as everyday drinking vessels, because these decay without a trace, while the metal fittings of the ceremonial drinking horns of the elite are preserved archaeologically.\n\nJulius Caesar has a description of Gaulish use of aurochs drinking horns (\"cornu urii\") in \"De bello gallico\" 6.28:\n\nThe Germanic peoples of the Migration period imitated glass drinking horns from Roman models.\nOne fine 5th century Merovingian example found at Bingerbrück, Rhineland-Palatinate made from olive green glass is kept at the British Museum.\nSome of the skills of the Roman glass-makers survived in Lombardic Italy, exemplified by a blue glass drinking-horn from Sutri, also in the British Museum.\nThe two Gallehus Horns (early 5th century), made from some 3 kg of gold and electrum each, are usually interpreted as drinking horns, although some scholars point out that it cannot be ruled out that they may have been intended as blowing horns. After the discovery of the first of these horns in 1639, Christian IV of Denmark by 1641 did refurbish it into a usable drinking horn, adding a rim, extending its narrow end and closing it up with a screw-on pommel. These horns are the most spectacular known specimens of Germanic Iron Age drinking horns, but they were lost in 1802 and are now only known from 17th to 18th century drawings.\n\nSome notable examples of drinking horns of Dark Ages Europe were made of the horns of the Aurochs, the wild ancestor of domestic cattle which became extinct in the 17th century. These horns were carefully dressed up and their edges lipped all round with silver. The remains of a notable example were recovered from the Sutton Hoo burial.\n\nThe British Museum also has a fine pair of 6th century Anglo-Saxon drinking horns, made from Aurochs horns with silver-gilt mounts, recovered from the princely burial at Taplow, Buckinghamshire.\n\nNumerous pieces of elaborate drinking equipment have been found in female graves in all pagan Germanic societies, beginning in the Germanic Roman Iron Age and spanning a full millennium, into the Viking Age.\n\nDrinking horns are attested from Viking Age Scandinavia. In the \"Prose Edda\", Thor drank from a horn that unbeknown to him contained all the seas, and in the process he scared Útgarða-Loki and his kin by managing to drink a conspicuous part of its content. They also feature in \"Beowulf\", and fittings for drinking horns were also found at the Sutton Hoo burial site. Carved horns are mentioned in \"Guðrúnarkviða II\", a poem composed about 1000 AD and preserved in the \"Poetic Edda\":\n\n\"Beowulf\" (493ff.) describes the serving of mead in carved horns.\n\nHorn fragments of Viking Age drinking horns are only rarely preserved, showing that both cattle and goat horns were in use, but the number of decorative metal horn terminals and horn mounts recovered archaeologically show that the drinking horn was much more widespread than the small number of preserved horns would otherwise indicate.\nMost Viking Age drinking horns were probably from domestic cattle, holding rather less than half a litre. The significantly larger aurochs horns of the Sutton Hoo burial would have been the exception.\n\nDrinking horns were the ceremonial drinking vessel for those of high status all through the medieval period\nReferences to drinking horns in medieval literature include the Arthurian tale of Caradoc and the Middle English romance of King Horn.\nThe Bayeux Tapestry (1070s) shows a scene of feasting before Harold Godwinson embarks for Normandy. Five figures are depicted as sitting at a table in the upper story of a building, three of them holding drinking horns.\n\nMost Norwegian drinking horns preserved from the Middle Ages have ornamented metal mountings, while the horns themselves are smooth and unornamented. Carvings in the horns themselves are also known, but these appear relatively late, and are of a comparative simplicity that classifies them as folk art.\n\nCorpus Christi College of Cambridge University has a large aurochs drinking horn, allegedly predating the College's foundation in the 14th century, which is still drunk from at College feasts.\n\nThe \"Oldenburg horn\" was made in 1474/75 by German artisans for Christian I of Denmark when he visited Cologne to reconcile Charles the Bold of Burgundy. It is made of silver and gilt, richly ornamented with the coats of arms of Burgundy and Denmark. The horn has its name from being kept in the Oldenburg family castle for two centuries before being moved to its present location in Copenhagen. It became associated in legend with count Otto I of Oldenburg, who was supposed to have received it from a fairy woman in 980.\n\nDrinking horns remained in use for ceremonial purposes throughout the Early Modern period. A magnificent drinking horn was made for the showpiece of the Amsterdam Guild of Arquebusiers by Amsterdam jeweller Arent Coster in 1547, now kept in the Rijksmuseum.\n\nIn 17th to 18th century Scotland, a distinct type of drinking horn develops.\nOne aurochs drinking horn still preserved in Dunvegan Castle on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. It was only produced before guests, and the drinker in using it, twisted his arms round its spines, and turning his mouth towards the right shoulder, was expected to drain it off.\n\nGerman Renaissance and Baroque horns often were lavishly decorated with silverwork.\nOne such example is depicted in a 1653 painting by Willem Kalf, known as \"Still Life with Drinking Horn\".\n\nLavishly decorated drinking horns in the Baroque style, some imitating cornucopias, some made from ivory, including gold, silver and enamel decorations continued to be produced as luxury items\nin 19th to early 20th century imperial Austria and Germany.\n\nAlso in the 19th century, drinking horns inspired by the Romantic Viking revival were made for German student corps for ritual drinking.\nIn the context of Romanticism, a ceremonial drinking horn with decorations depicting the story of the Mead of Poetry was given to Swedish poet Erik Gustaf Geijer by his students in 1817, now in the Private Collection of Johan Paues, Stockholm.\n\nRam or goat drinking horns, known as \"kantsi\", remain an important accessory in the culture of ritual toasting in Georgia.\nDuring a formal dinner (\"supra\") Georgians propose a toast, led by a toastmaster (\"tamada\") who sets the topic of each round of toasting. Toasts are made with either wine or brandy, toasting with beer is considered an insult.\n\nIn Swiss culture, a large drinking horn together with a wreath of oak leaves is the traditional prize for the winning team of a Hornussen tournament.\n\nModern-day Asatru adherents use drinking horns for Blóts and sumbels.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "608908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=608908", "title": "Dust jacket", "text": "Dust jacket\n\nThe dust jacket (sometimes book jacket, dust wrapper or dust cover) of a book is the detachable outer cover, usually made of paper and printed with text and illustrations. This outer cover has folded flaps that hold it to the front and back book covers. Often the back panel or flaps are printed with biographical information about the author, a summary of the book from the publisher (known as a blurb), and/or critical praise from celebrities or authorities in the book's subject area. In addition to its promotional role, the dust jacket protects the book covers from damage. However, since it is itself relatively fragile, and since dust jackets have practical, aesthetic, and sometimes financial value, the jacket may in turn be wrapped in another jacket, usually transparent, especially if the book is a library volume.\n\nBefore the 1820s, most books were published as unbound sellers and were generally sold to customers either in this form, or in simple bindings executed for the bookseller, or in bespoke bindings commissioned by the customer. At this date, publishers did not have their books bound in uniform \"house\" bindings, so there was no reason for them to issue dust jackets. Book owners did occasionally fashion their own jackets out of leather, wallpaper, fur, or other material, and many other types of detachable protective covers were made for codices, manuscripts, and scrolls from ancient times through the Middle Ages and into the modern period.\n\nAt the end of the 18th century publishers began to issue books in plain paper-covered boards, sometimes with a printed spine-label; this form of binding was intended to be temporary. Some collections of loose prints were issued at this period in printed paper wrappings, again intended to be temporary. In the first two decades of the nineteenth century, publishers started issuing some smaller books in bindings of printed paper-covered boards, and throughout the 1820s and 1830s some small popular books, notably annual gift-books and almanacs, were issued in detachable printed pasteboard sheaths. These small boxes are sometimes loosely and erroneously referred to as the first dust jackets. True publisher's bindings in cloth and leather, in which all, or a substantial part of, an edition were bound, were also introduced shortly before 1820, by the innovative publisher William Pickering.\n\nAfter publishers' cloth bindings started coming into common use on all types of books in the 1820s, the first publishers' dust jackets appeared by the end of that decade. The earliest known examples were issued on English literary annuals which were popular from the 1820s to the 1850s. These books often had fancy bindings that needed protection. The jackets that were used at this time completely enclosed the books like wrapping paper and were sealed shut with wax or glue.\n\nThe oldest publishers' dust jacket now on record was issued in 1829 on an English annual, \"Friendship's Offering\" for 1830. It was discovered at the Bodleian Library in Oxford by Michael Turner, a former curator and Head of Conservation at the Library. Its existence was announced by Oxford in 2009. It is three years older than the previous oldest known jacket, which was discovered in 1934 by the English bookman John Carter on another English annual, \"The Keepsake\" for 1833 (issued in 1832). Both jackets are of the type that completely enclosed the books.\n\nMost jackets of this type were torn when they were opened and then discarded like gift-wrapping paper; they were not designed to be reused, and surviving examples are known on only a handful of titles. The scarcity of jackets of this type, together with the lack of written documentation from publishers of the period, makes it very hard to determine how widely these all-enclosing jackets were used during the period from 1820 to 1850, but they were probably common on ornately bound annuals and on some trade books.\n\nThe earliest known dust jackets of the modern style, with flaps, which covered just the binding and left the text block exposed, date from the 1850s, although this type of jacket was probably in at least limited use some years earlier. This is the jacket that became standard in the publishing industry and is still in use today. It is believed that flap-style jackets were in general use by the 1880s, and probably earlier, although the number of surviving examples from the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s is too small to prove exactly when they became ubiquitous, and again, there are no known publishers' records that document the use of dust jackets during these decades. There are, however, enough surviving examples from the 1890s to state unequivocally that dust jackets were all but universal throughout that decade. They were probably issued more often than not by the 1860s and 1870s in Europe, Great Britain, and the United States.\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century, nearly all dust jackets were discarded at or soon after purchase. Many were probably discarded in bookstores as the books were put out for display, or when they were sold; there is evidence that this was common practice in England until World War I. The period from the 1820s to 1900 was a golden age for publishers' decorative bookbinding, and most dust jackets were much plainer than the books they covered, often simply repeating the main elements of the binding decoration in black on cream or brown paper. For this reason, most people preferred to display their books in their bindings, much as earlier generations had displayed their library books in their gold-tooled individual bindings, usually in leather or vellum. Even late in the nineteenth century there were still some publishers who were not using dust jackets at all (the English publisher Methuen is one example). Some firms, such as subscription houses which sold millions of cheap books door-to-door, probably never used them.\n\nCloth dust jackets became popular late in the nineteenth century. These jackets, with the outer cloth usually reinforced with an underlayer of paper, were issued mostly on ornate gift editions, often in two volumes and often with a slipcase. Other types of publishers' boxes were also popular in the second half of the nineteenth century, including many made to hold multi-volume sets of books. The jackets on boxed volumes were often plain, sometimes with cutouts on the spine to allow the title or volume numbers of the books to be seen.\n\nAfter 1900, fashions in, and the economics of, publishing caused book bindings to become less decorative, and it was cheaper for publishers to make the jackets more attractive. By around 1920, most of the artwork and decoration had migrated from the binding to the dust jacket, and jackets were routinely printed with multiple colors, extensive advertising and blurbs; even the underside of the jacket was now sometimes used for advertising.\n\nAs dust jackets became more attractive than the bindings, more people began to keep the jackets on their books, at least until they became soiled, torn, or worn out. One bit of evidence that indicates when jackets became saved objects is the movement of the printed price from the spine of the jacket to a corner of one of the flaps. This also occurred in the 1910s and early 1920s. When jackets were routinely discarded at point of purchase, it did not matter where the price was printed (and many early jackets were not printed with any price), but now if book buyers of the 1910s and 1920s wanted to save the jacket and give a book as a gift, they could clip off the price without ruining the jacket.\n\nIn Japan, both hardcover and softcover books frequently come with two dust jackets – a full-sized one, serving the same purpose as in the West (it is usually retained with the book), and a thin \"obi\" (\"belt\"; colloquially \"belly band\" in English), which is generally disposed of and serves a similar function to 19th century Western dust jackets.\n\nSimilar bands occasionally appear in the west, for example in Palookaville #20.\n\nDust jackets from the 1920s and later were often decorated in art deco styles which are highly prized by collectors. Some of them are worth far more than the books they cover. The most famous example is the jacket on the first edition of \"The Great Gatsby\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald, published in 1925. Without jacket, the book brings $1,000 or so. With the jacket it can bring $20,000 or $30,000 or more, depending on condition. One copy in a near mint jacket was listed for sale in 2009 for half a million dollars. The most valuable jackets are usually those on the high spots of literature. Condition is of paramount importance to value. Other examples of highly prized jackets include those on most of Ernest Hemingway's titles, and the first editions of books such as Harper Lee's \"To Kill A Mockingbird,\" J. D. Salinger's \"Catcher in the Rye\" and Dashiell Hammett's \"The Maltese Falcon\", among many others. Prices for dust jackets have become so inflated in recent years that even early reprints of certain titles in jacket can command good prices. Conversely, if the book itself is unimportant, or at least has little demand, the jacket is usually of little value either, but nearly all surviving pre-1920 jackets add some additional value to the book they cover.\n\nSome collectors and dealers, in an effort to increase the value of a first edition that has lost its original jacket, will take a jacket from a later printing and \"marry\" it to the earlier one. This practice persists because some customers will pay more for a first edition in a later jacket than they would for a jacketless copy. However, switching jackets muddles the bibliographical record and creates a forgery of sorts.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "355044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355044", "title": "El Tajín", "text": "El Tajín\n\nEl Tajín is a pre-Columbian archeological site in southern Mexico and is one of the largest and most important cities of the Classic era of Mesoamerica. A part of the Classic Veracruz culture, El Tajín flourished from 600 to 1200 CE and during this time numerous temples, palaces, ballcourts, and pyramids were built. From the time the city fell, in 1230, to 1785, no European seems to have known of its existence, until a government inspector chanced upon the Pyramid of the Niches.\n\nEl Tajín was named a World Heritage site in 1992, due to its cultural importance and its architecture. This architecture includes the use of decorative niches and cement in forms unknown in the rest of Mesoamerica. Its best-known monument is the Pyramid of the Niches, but other important monuments include the Arroyo Group, the North and South Ballcourts and the palaces of Tajín Chico. In total there have been 20 ballcourts discovered at this site, (the last 3 being discovered in March 2013). Since the 1970s, El Tajin has been the most important archeological site in Veracruz for tourists, attracting 386,406 visitors in 2017.\n\nIt is also the site of the annual Cumbre Tajin Festival, which occurs each March featuring indigenous and foreign cultural events as well as concerts by popular musicians.\n\nThe site is located in Mexico in the highlands of the municipality of Papantla in modern-day Veracruz, not far from the city of Poza Rica, which lies northwest of the port and city of Veracruz. The city is set in the low rolling mountains that lead from the Sierra Madre Oriental to the Gulf coast near the Tecolutla River. In ancient times, this city was located in the northeast corner of what is called Mesoamerica, and controlled an area from between the Cazones and Tecolutla Rivers to the modern state of Puebla. The main city is defined by two streams which merge to form the Tlahuanapa Arroyo, a tributary of the Tecolutla River. These two streams provided the population’s potable water. Most of the buildings are at the southern end, where the land is relatively flat and the two streams converge. The site extends to the northwest where terraces where constructed to place more buildings, mostly for the city’s elite. However the city also had communities located on the hills east and west of the main city, with mostly lower-class dwellings. Total site extends for .\n\nThe area is rainforest, with a hot wet climate of the Senegal type. Average temperature for the year is 35 °C with hurricanes possible from June to October. It is also affected by a weather phenomenon called “nortes.” These are cold fronts with winds that come from the north and down the Tamaulipas and Veracruz coasts. The site has no major settlements located next to it. Surrounding it are tobacco fields, banana plantations, apiaries and vanilla groves. The closest settlement of any real size is Papantla.\n\nWhen it was rediscovered by officialdom in 1785, the site was known to the local Totonac, whose ancestors may also have built the city, as El Tajín, which was said to mean “of thunder or lightning bolt”. Related to this is their belief that twelve old thunderstorm deities, known as Tajín, still inhabit the ruins. However, a series of indigenous maps dating from the time of the Spanish conquest, found in nearby Tihuatlan and now known as the Lienzos de Tuxpan, suggest that the city might then have been called “Mictlan” or “place of the dead”, a common denomination for ancient sites whose original names have been lost. This name also appears in the Matricula de Tributos, a surviving Aztec tribute record, which later formed part of the Codex Mendoza. This may therefore be linked to another Totonac meaning claimed for El Tajín: “place of the invisible beings or spirits”.\n\nChronology studies at Tajín and nearby sites show that the area has been occupied at least since 5600 BCE and show how nomadic hunters and gatherers eventually became sedentary farmers, building more complex societies prior to the rise of the city of El Tajin. The pace of this societal progression became more rapid with the rise of the neighboring Olmec civilization around 1150 BCE, although the Olmecs were never here in great numbers. It is unclear who built the city. Some argue in favor of the Totonacs and the Xapaneca; however, there is a significant amount of evidence that the area was populated by the Huastec at the time the settlement was founded in the 1st century CE Monumental construction started soon after and by 600 CE, El Tajín was a city. The rapid rise of Tajin was due to its strategic position along the old Mesoamerican trade routes. It controlled the flow of commodities, both exports such as vanilla and imports from other locations in what is now Mexico and Central America. From the early centuries, objects from Teotihuacan are abundant.\n\nFrom 600 to 1200 CE, El Tajín was a prosperous city that eventually controlled much of what is now modern Veracruz state. The city-state was highly centralized, with the city itself having more than fifty ethnicities living there. Most of the population lived in the hills surrounding the main city, and the city obtained most of its foodstuffs from the Tecolutla, Nautla and Cazones areas. These fields not only produced staples such as corn and beans but luxury items such as cacao. One of the panels at the Pyramid of the Niches shows a ceremony being held at a cacao tree. The religion was based on the movements of the planets, the stars and the Sun and Moon, with the Mesoamerican ballgame and pulque having extremely important parts. This led to the building of many pyramids with temples and seventeen ballcourts, more than any other Mesoamerican site. The city began to have extensive influence starting around this time, which can be best seen at the neighboring site of Yohualichan, whose buildings show the kinds of niches that define El Tajin. Evidence of the city’s influence can be seen along the Veracruz Gulf coast to the Maya region and into the high plateau of central Mexico.\n\nAt the end of the Classic period, El Tajín survived the widespread social collapse, migrations and destructions that forced the abandonment of many population centers at the end of this period. El Tajín reached its peak after the fall of Teotihuacan, and conserved many cultural traits inherited from that civilization. It reached its apogee in the Epi-Classic (900-1100 CE) before suffering destruction and the encroachment of the jungle.\n\nEl Tajín prospered until the early years of the 13th century, when it was destroyed by fire, presumably started by an invading force believed to be the Chichimecs. The Totonacs established the nearby settlement of Papantla after the fall of El Tajín. El Tajín was left to the jungle and remained covered and silent for over 500 years. While the city had been completely covered by jungle from its demise until the 19th century, it is unlikely that knowledge of the place was completely lost to the native peoples. Archeological evidence shows that a village existed here at the time the Spanish arrived and the area has always been considered sacred by the Totonacs. However, there are no records by any Europeans about the place prior to the late 18th century.\n\nIn 1785, an official by the name of Diego Ruiz stumbled upon the Pyramid of the Niches, whilst looking for clandestine tobacco plantings breaching the royal monopoly in this isolated area rarely visited by the authorities. He made a drawing of the pyramid and reported his find to a publication called Gaceta de Mexico. He claimed the natives had kept the place secret. The publication of the pyramid’s existence in the Gaceta influenced academic circles in New Spain and Europe, attracting the attention of antiquarians José Antonio Alzate y Ramírez and Ciriaco Gonazlez Carvajal, who wrote about it. It also gained the interest of several academics, who compared the pyramid with the constructions of ancient Rome. The pyramid was further advertised by Italian Pietro Márquez in Europe and by Alexander von Humboldt.\nSince its discovery by Europeans, the site has attracted visitors for two centuries. German architect Charles Nebel visited the site in 1831 and was the first to graphically and narratively detail the Pyramid of the Niches as well as the nearby ruins of Mapilca and Tuzapan. He was also the first to speculate that the pyramid was part of a larger city. His drawings and descriptions were published in a book named \"Voyage pittoresque et archéologique\" published in Paris in 1836.\n\nThe first archeologists reached the site in the early 20th century and included Teobert Maler, Edward Seler, Francisco del Paso y Troncoso and Herbert and Ellen Spinden. With the discovery of oil in the area came roads that were built and improved from the 1920s to the 1940s. This allowed for more intensive investigation of the area. In 1935-38 the first formal mapping, clearing and exploration was done by Agustin Garcia Vega. The first building to be completely cleared of jungle growth was the Pyramid of the Niches. He eventually cleared , uncovering more buildings and proposed that it be called “The Archeological City of El Tajín.” Starting from 1938, excavation and reconstruction work was sponsored by INAH and headed by Jose Garcia Payon, uncovering platforms, ballcourts and part of Tajín Chico with its palaces. He continued to explore the site for 39 years until his death in 1977 despite the challenges of working in the jungle and the lack of funds. By this time, he had uncovered most of the major buildings and established that Tajín was one of the most important cities of ancient Mexico. By the 1970s, the site was one of the few in Veracruz state that attracted significant numbers of tourists. From 1984 to 1994, Jürgen K. Brüggemann built on the work of García Payón, uncovering 35 more buildings. It is believed that only half of El Tajin archeological site has been uncovered.\n\nEl Tajín was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1992, because of its historical significance and architecture and engineering. “Its architecture, which is unique in Mesoamerica, is characterized by elaborate carved reliefs on the columns and frieze. The 'Pyramid of the Niches', a masterpiece of ancient Mexican and American architecture, reveals the astronomical and symbolic significance of the buildings.” The site is one of the most important in Mexico and the most important in the state of Veracruz.\n\nIts significance is due to its size and unique forms of art and architecture. The borders of the city’s residential areas have not yet been defined but is the entire site is estimated at . To date, only about fifty percent of the city's buildings has been excavated, revealing a series of plazas, palaces, and administrative buildings within a two-square-mile area. Unlike the highly rigid grid patterns of ancient cities in the central highlands of Mexico, the builders of El Tajin designed and aligned buildings as individual units.\nThere are several architectural features here which are unique to the place or seen in only rarely in Mesoamerica. Adornment in the form of niches and stepped frets are omnipresent, decorating even utilitarian buttresses and platform walls. Stepped frets are seen in other parts of Mesoamerica but rarely to this extent. The use of niches is unique to El Tajin.\n\nOne notable aspect of the construction at El Tajin is the use of poured cement in forms. Surviving roof fragments from Building C in the Tajín Chico section is an example of cement roof constructions. Due to the lack of beams or other materials to prop it up, this roof had to be very thick to support itself. To lighten the load and to bind the layers of cement, pumice stones and pottery shards were mixed into the cement. The cement could not be poured all at once but rather in successive layers. It has been suggested that the buildings were filled with earth to support the roof as it was being poured and dried. The finished roofs were nearly a meter thick and almost perfectly flat. While this kind of cement roof is common in modern times, it was unique in the Mesoamerican world. Impressions of baskets, tamale wrappers and other items have been found in the dried cement. The poured cement was used in the only building with two floors at the site, Building B, as a roof and as a separator between the ground and upper floor. The only other known example of two story construction is in the Mayan territories. Another feature shared only with the Mayans is the use of a light blue paint. (wikerson45) Another feature unique to El Tajin is that a number of the residences have windows placed to allow cool breezes to enter on hot days.\n\nWhile ballcourts are common in Mesoamerica, El Tajin distinguishes itself by having seventeen. Two of these ballcourts contain sculpted panels which depict the ball game and its ritual significance. The most impressive of these panels are on the South Ballcourt which contain images of underworld deities and a ballplayer being decapitated in order to approach the gods and ask for pulque for his people.\n\nSince becoming a World Heritage Site, research and conservation efforts have been made to promote knowledge of and protect the site. There have been a number of research projects as well as reconstruction projects and projects to make more of the site accessible to visitors. However, the director states that more needs to be done to conserve the site, especially its fragile murals, and to balance the needs of tourists against the need to conserve the site in general. Each year since 1992, the number of visitors to the site increases which now stands at 653,000 annually.\n\nAir pollution from oil-drilling platforms and power stations along the coast causes high levels of acid rain in the region, which is eroding the intricately carved reliefs on the soft limestone buildings “at an alarming rate”, according to Humberto Bravo of the University of Mexico's Center for Atmospheric Sciences in 2007.\n\nThe entrance to the site is located at the south end. In being named a World Heritage Site in 1992, new facilities have been added to this area, such as a cafeteria, information services, a park and administrative offices. The site museum is also located here. In addition, the Danza de los Voladores is enacted at the entrance to the site and is considered a requirement for visitors. The voladores appear every half-hour at the pole and circle erected just outside the main gate.\n\nThe park is named Parque Takilhsukut and is located about one km outside the site proper. It is a modern facility with the aim of being a center of Veracruz indigenous identity. It covers 17 hectares with a capacity of 40,000 people. It hosts fairs, conventions and other events, including part of the annual Cumbre Tajín cultural festival which is held in March. There are also facilities for workshops, exhibitions, alternative therapies, seminars and ceremonies.\n\nThe site museum is divided into two parts: an enclosed building and a roofed area covering large stone sculpture fragments. The enclosed room is for smaller objects that have been found during the years the site has been explored, most coming from the Pyramid of the Niches. One of the most interesting objects on display is an altar from Building 4. It is a large stone slab sculpted to depict four individuals standing in pairs with a figure of intertwined snakes between the two pairs. The snakes represent the ball game marker called the tlaxmalacatle in Aztec times. The main exhibits of the roofed area are the fragments recovered from the Building of the Columns, with a number partially reassembled. One tells the story of 13 Rabbit, a ruler of El Tajin who probably had the building constructed. The scene shows as dual procession with 13 Rabbit seated on a wooden throne and his feet on a severed head. In front is a sacrifice victim with his entrails slung over a frame. 13 Rabbit’s name glyph appears above as well as an attendant named 4 Axe. The rest of the procession consists of warriors holding captives by their hair.\n\nThis is called the Arroyo Group because two streams surround it on three sides. This area is one of the oldest sections of the city, and is more than . It is flanked by four high buildings, named Buildings 16, 18, 19 and 20, which were topped by temples. Stairways lead from the plaza floor to the temples above. Unlike the rest of the city, these four buildings are uniform in height and nearly symmetrical. The pyramids here are primitive in comparison to the rest of the site, with niches that are not as finely formed. The east and west pyramids of the arroyo group each held three temples at the top. Another unusual feature is that this plaza has no smaller structures such as buildings or altars to break up the space. It has been determined that this was the city marketplace because of the large plaza space for stalls and for a deity found here that is related to commerce. The merchant deity found here has features more in common with this kind of deity in the central highlands of Mexico than of Tajín. The market that filled this plaza consisted of stalls made with sticks and cloth offering regional products such as vanilla as well as products from other parts of Mesoamerica such as jaguar skins, exotic birds such as the parrot and the macaw and quetzal feathers. Slaves for service and sacrifice were also sold here. West of the building on the south side is a large ball court with sloped sides and sculpted friezes depicting the god Quetzalcoatl. When the city fell, most of the sculptures in this area were smashed or defaced with some being reused as building stone.\n\nThis pyramid has as a number of names including, El Tajín, Pyramid of Papantla, Pyramid of the Seven Stories and the Temple of the Niches. It has become the focus of the site because of its unusual design and good state of preservation. It was prominent in ancient times as well. A large quantity of sculpture was recovered from this pyramid. The building is mostly constructed of carefully cut and crafted flagstones, the largest of which is estimated to be about eight metric tons in weight. The stones, especially around the niches are fitted together as to need a minimum amount of lime and earth mortar. The structure originally was covered in stucco which served as the base for paint.\n\nThe pyramid has seven stories. Each of these consists of a sloping base wall called a talud and a vertical wall called a tablero, which was fairly common in Mesoamerica. What is unusual about this construction and others in the city are the addition of decorative niches with the top capped by what Jose Garcia Payon called a “flying cornice,” a triangular overhang. The stones are arranged in controlled lines and delicate proportions. Originally the structure was painted a dark red with the niches in black intended to deepen the shadows of the recessed niches. Niches are also found underneath the stairway along the east face, which indicates that the stairway was a later addition. The niches on the original structure, not counting those on the later stairway, total 365, the solar year. At the top of the pyramid there were tablets framed by grotesque serpent-dragons.\n\nThe ritual function of the building is not primarily calendaric. The deep niches imitate caves, which long have been considered to be passageways to the underworld, where many of the gods reside. Caves, especially those with springs, have been considered sacred in much of Mexico with offerings of flowers and candles being traditional. As last as the mid 20th century, remains of beeswax candles could still be found left on the first level of this pyramid. There is a popular belief that each niche contained an idol or effigy but archeological work here has ruled this out. The most important part of the structure was the temple that was on top of this pyramid; however, this was completely destroyed and little is known about what it might have looked like.\n\nSculpture from the temple is largely fragmentary. The larger tablets have depictions of the rain god, or a ruler dressed as the deity, involved in several ritual or mythological scenes. This seems to have been the most important god of the culture as other depictions are found in other places at the site. His appearance here underlies the significance of this pyramid. The stairway to the temple is adorned on the sides with frets, which are called \"xicalcoliuhqui\". It is thought to symbolize lightning and while it is common in Mesoamerica, it is a very prominent motif here. These frets were probably painted blue as they were on other buildings, where remains of paint have been found. At the top of the stairway were probably two large three-dimensional stelae. One has survived mostly intact and is now in the site museum. Off the stairs and leading east from the pyramid are large round stone with holes in the middle, in which were probably placed banners. The interior of the pyramid is rocks and earth. This fill is strained between the sloping walls which become the taluds of each level of the pyramid. Buried under all of this is a smaller stricter with taluds but no niches.\n\nThe pyramid is flanked by two smaller structures named Building 2 and Building 4. Both are small temple-like platforms. Building 4 contains a smaller, older structure inside it that may be among the earliest structures at the site.\n\nTajin Chico is a multilevel portion of the site that stretches north-northwest from the older parts of the city up a hill. Much of this section was created by using massive amounts of landfill. It is an immense acropolis composed of numerous palaces and other civil structures. There are relatively few temples here. It is also more easily defended than other parts of the city. Tajin Chico is so named because it was initially thought to be a separate but related site. It is now known that it belonged to the center of the city. However, as the term was already in the literature about the site, it has stuck.\n\nBuilding C was not a temple but its function is not entirely clear. Nearby buildings A and B were palaces. It is probably that this building was used by priests or rulers to receive visitors, petitioners and others. The roof of Building C was more than in size and covered two rooms on the west side as well as main room which opened to the east through five piers. The entire exterior of the building is covered in stepped frets, with these frets arranged to give the appearance as niches. To further this effect, the inside of the frets were painted dark red and the exterior portion light blue, similar to turquoise. The broad eastern stairway was also painted with cloud-like scroll motifs.\n\nBuilding B is a two story structure that was used as a residence and classified as a palace. Like other structures nearby, its roof is a thick slab of cement and there is another slab that separates the ground and upper floors. The entrance to the building from the plaza was through a divided stairway, leading to a single room in size. This space is broken by six stone and cement pillars which support the floor above. These columns were thickened over time as it became apparent to have stronger bracing for the weight of the two floors. The upper story is reached by narrow stairway. This floor is more spacious even though there are columns here as well. This is the only multistoried palace found outside the Mayan areas.\n\nBuilding A has two levels, stepped frets and niches and is reminiscent of structures found in the Yucatán. However, the lower level of the building is not rooms but a solid base. The lower level is adorned with large rectangular panels which appear to have been painted red. The entrance is on the south side of the building and is quite elaborate. The upper level contains a corridor that goes all the way around and a number of rooms. The upper level was adorned with stepped frets and scrolls as well. These were painted yellow, blue, red and black. The panels inside were painted with murals, of which only fragments survive. At the east and west side of the corridors are entrances to the rooms, two interconnected rooms on each side of the building. Building A is constructed over older buildings that were buried when this area was filled in, some aspects of the building, like the buttresses been damage due to settling where there are no buildings below. The facade depicts a false stairway and balustrades of stepped frets capped by niches. It is unknown if the similarity between this building and the Pyramid of the Niches indicates a relationship between the two. The false stairs were originally adorned with scroll motifs done in blue and yellow paint, but very little remains. At the center of the false stairway are true stairs leading upwards under an arch to the first level of the palace.\n\nThe Building of the Columns dominates the highest portion of Tajin Chico. It is part of one of the last building complexes built at El Tajín. These buildings are situated on a platform-terrace with was formed on natural contours and filled in spaces. The other structure on this platform is called the Annex or the Building of the Tunnels, as it is connected to the Building of the Columns by a passageway. Behind these buildings is a large plaza with small low structures on its edges. This building is named for the columns that adorned the east facade of the structure. The columns were made by stacking circles cut from flagstone. Then the surface of the columns was sculpted with scenes celebrating a ruler named 13 Rabbit, who probably had this structure built. Most of the remains of these columns are on display at the site museum. This structure also had a cement roof, which was arched in the “porch” area between the columns and the inner rooms. There is an inner courtyard and ornately decorated, with stepped frets, other symbols in stone and cement which were painted. This complex was one of the last to be built and it also shows evidence if fire and other damage from the fall of the city.\n\nJust east of Tajin Chico is an area of valley floor. There are numerous buildings in this section but many are not accessible to visitors due to the lack of trails and many have yet to be explored. Two have been partially explored. The first is the Great Xicalcoluihqui, or the Great Enclosure. This is a wall, which from above forms a giant stepped fret and encloses about . This structure is unique among Mesoamerican sites and contains two or three small ballcourts. The sides of the enclosure are formed by a slender platform with sloping sides and free standing niches, resembling the Pyramid of the Niches. There are more than a hundred niches in this wall, broken up by a number of entrances. The other structure is the Great Ballcourt, the largest court at El Tajin. It is located at the northwest corner of the Great Xicalcoluihqui and at the base of Tajin Chico. It has vertical sides and is about long. Unlike other ballccourts, there are no carved panels and no sculptures have been associated with this structure.\n\nBuilding 3 or the Blue Temple has some features that set it apart from other pyramids at the site. Except for six benches on the staircase and at the top of the balustrades, probably later additions, there are no niches. The seven stories of the pyramid are composed of gently sloping walling divided into panels of varying widths. The unreconstructed north side has a large indentation made by looters before the site was protected by guards. No sculpture is known to have come from this building and nothing of the temple at the top remains. The building was covered in cement several times over its history, and each layer of this cement was painted in blue rather than the more common red. Remnants of this paint can be seen on part of the stairway and on the side facing east toward Building 23. Blue is most often associated with the rain god but there is no other evidence to support this.\n\nWhile the Blue Temple was a fairly early construction, the pyramid next to it, Building 23 was built very late in Tajin’s history. It consists of five stories in near vertical talud without niches. The original staircase was destroyed then reworked into its present form. The divider in the center is a buttress to hold the fill behind the stairs in place. The stairs are made from a mixture of lime, sand and clay without a stone core. The interior of the building is composed of loose stone, mostly rounded river boulders. At the top, there the temple was located, is a series of stepped merlons which look like medieval European battlements.\n\nJust south of Buildings 3 and 23 is Building 15, which is only partially excavated. It faces west and appears to have a civil function much like Building C in Tajín Chico. It has stairways on both the east and west sides that lead to the top of the second level. The third story begins with a wall of niches and no visible stairs. The two lower levels are adorned with larger niches as is the top of the stairway divider. Beneath the larger niches is a line of seven panels. Under the fourth panel, an older panel was found. Deeper excavation found an older, damaged structure which was covered over by the visible structure. This building is thought to the last built with niches.\n\nBuilding 5 is considered to be the stateliest of the El Tajin site. While located next to the Pyramid of the Niches, its visual appeal is not lost to its more famous neighbor. It is located in the center of a pyramid complex and consists of a truncated pyramid rising from a platform that is over in size. Access to the first level of the pyramid, which is lined with niches, is via a single staircase on the west side or a double staircase on the east side. Access to the top of the pyramid, where the temple once stood, is via a double staircase on the east side. The top of the pyramid contains two platforms, both of which are decorated with stepped frets. Between the two sets of staircases on the first level on the east side is a tall column-line sculpture. It had been thrown down from the top of the pyramid in ancient times and broken. Archeologists reassembled it at the spot in which it was found. The sculpture is similar in style to the carved stone yokes of Veracruz. The figure seems to be an allegorical representation of a seated figure with a severed upper torso and a skull for a head. The arms are holding a serpent like form and the body contains scrolls, which may signify sacrificial blood. The small buildings that surround this pyramid are meant to compliment it. However, the one on the northeast side has been completely destroyed due to centuries-old trail that was used when this area was still jungle.\n\nThe North Ballcourt is constructed by three layers of large flagstones. There are six carved panels with ritual scenes and an ornamental frieze that runs along both walls. The court is long, which is considered to be unusually small and has vertical rather than sloping walls. It is probably one of the oldest structures at Tajín.\n\nPortions of the panels and friezes are worn to the point that large areas are incomplete. The four end panels have scenes relating to the ritual of the ball game that result in entreaties to the gods. The central panels depict the gods responding or performing a ritual of their own. Variant forms of the god of pulque appear over each of the end panels, suggesting that the drink was an important part of the ritual. The southeast, east and northwest panels show a ruler on a throne. The southwest panel has a figure dressed as an eagle seated in a vat of liquid, probably pulque, and being fed by a female figure on the left and a male on the right. The deteriorated north central panel shows two cross-legged figures facing each other. One is seated on a throne and the other by a pulque vat. In the center are two intertwined serpents which seem to form the shape of a tlaxmalactl or ball game marker. The friezes running along the upper edges of the court are composed of interlocking scroll figures, each containing a central element of a head and an eye. Many have feathered headdresses and reptilian attributes and a few are human like.\nThe South Ballcourt, like the North Ball court, has only vertical walls which are sculpted. The sculpted panels on these walls remain largely intact and show in step-by-step fashion how the ball game was played here, complete with ceremonies, sacrifice and the response of the gods. The court has a general east-west alignment and is long and wide. Spectators could watch events from Building 5 to the north and Building 6 to the south as well as from stands built on one side of the court. The court is made of stones of up to ten tons in weight many of which came from outside the valley. Once the court walls were built six panels were sculpted at the corners and centers of the two walls. The panels on the ends show scenes from the ballgame itself and the center panels show responses from the gods.\n\nThe southeast panel illustrates the opening ritual when the principal participant is elaborately dressed and is being handed a bundle of spears. This is part of an initial activity before the game itself starts. Overlooking this scene is the death deity who rises from a vat of liquid, perhaps pulque. The glyphs above the deity identify it with the planet Venus. Next is the southwest panel in which a different ceremonial preparation is depicted. The principal participant is supine on a kind of a sofa. Two musicians are playing a turtle shell drum and clay rattles. A figure dressed as an eagle dances in front while a skeletal deity flies above and the death deity rises from liquid. The northwest panel shows the beginning of the ballgame. Two participants are standing in the center of the court with speech scrolls emerging from their mouths. One holds a large knife in his left hand and gestures with his right. Between them are intertwined slashes, the symbol of the ballgame and a ball. At their waists are the protective and ritual accoutrements which are very similar to the stone yokes, palmas and hachas common in elite burials. Behind the players are two figures, one with a deer head, who are watching from the court walls as well as the death deity again above. The northeast panel indicates that the game has been played and one of the participants is about to be sacrificed by having his head cut off. The three figures are all dressed in the garments and symbols of the ballgame. The center figure has his arms held back by the one on the left. The figure on the right holds a large knife which is at the center figure’s neck. There are scrolls indicating speech from the sacrifice as well as a depiction of the skeletal god.\n\nAfter this point, the panels deal with the response of the gods. The north central panel represents the continuation of the ritual in the afterlife, and shows how the events of the game connect the society of El Tajin to the gods. At the center of the scene is a temple with the rain and wind gods seated on top and a vat of liquid within. The sacrificed player appears here, whole and with a pot under his arm. He points to the vat and addresses the rain god. The liquid is protected by a reclining chacmool, who is speaking. What is being requested is pulque, indicated by a glyph indicating the mythical origin of the drink and a split image of the god of pulque above the scene. On the south central panel is depicting a scene after the sacrificed ball player has received the pulque with the same temple, glyphs and depiction of the pulque god. The differences are a depiction of the moon as a rabbit, the rain god in front of the temple and the level of the liquid in the vat lowered. The rain god is shown in a rite of auto sacrifice running a spike through part of his penis. The blood falls into the vat and to refill it with pulque.\n\nThe Cumbre Tajin is an annual artistic and cultural festival which is held at the site in March. The Cumbre Tajin is considered to be an identity festival of the Totonacs, who are considered to be the guardians of El Tajín. Events include those traditional to the Totonac culture as well as modern arts and events from cultures from as far as Tibet. Some of the events include musical concerts, experiencing a \"temazcal\", theatrical events and visiting El Tajin at night, with a total over 5,000 activities. Many of the cultural, craft and gastronomic events occur at the adjacent Parque Takilhsukut which just located just outside the archeological site. In 2008, 160,000 attended the event which featured Fito Páez, Ximena Sariñana and Los Tigres del Norte. Thirty percent of the revenue the event generates goes toward scholarships for Totonaca youth.\n\nIn 2009, the event added the Encuentro Internacional de Voladores (International Encounter of Voladores). For five days, voladores from various places perform at the poles erected at the site. The objective is not only to see the different costumes and styles of the groups but to share experiences about the fertility ritual. Voladores come from as far as San Luis Potosi and Guatemala.\n\nThe Cumbre Tajín has been criticized for its emphasis on modern shows rather than on cultural events. One criticism is the illumination of pyramids at night without any kind of cultural historical instruction. The criticism is that it disrespects the site and the Totonac people. There are also fears that large numbers of visitors to the site for events such as concerts by names such as Alejandra Guzmán damage the site. However, the Centro de Artes Indígenas de Veracruz states that it works very hard to preserve and promote Totonac culture through the event, sponsoring events such as traditional cooking, painting and the ritual of the Voladores.\n"}
{"id": "44701268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44701268", "title": "Ethnicities of the Philippine Cordilleras", "text": "Ethnicities of the Philippine Cordilleras\n\nThere are nine main ethnolinguistic groups in the Cordilleras. The Cordillera Region is located in Luzon and is the largest region in the Philippines. It has a distinct culture from the rest of the country and each town has its own dialect.\n\nThe Bontoc ethnolinguistic group can be found in the central and east portions of the Mountain Province. It mainly consists of the Balangaos and Gaddangs, with a significant portion who identify as part of the Kalinga group. The Bontoc live in a mountainous territory, particularly close to the Chico River and its tributaries.\n\nMineral resources (gold, copper, limestone, gypsum) can be found in the mountain areas. Gold in particular has been traditionally extracted from the Bontoc municipality. The Chico River provides sand, gravel and white clay, while the forests of Barlig and Sadanga within the area have rattan, bamboo and pine trees.\n\nBontocs have three different indigenous housing structures: the residence place of the family (\"katyufong\"), the dormitories for females (\"olog\"), and the dormitories for males (\"ato\"/\"ator\"). Different structures are mostly associated with agricultural needs, such as granaries and pigpens. Traditionally, all structures have \"inatep\", cogon grass roofs. Bontoc houses also have numerous utensils, tools, and weapons: like cooking tools; agricultural tools like bolos, trowels, and plows, bamboo or rattan fish traps; and battleaxes, knives, and spears for battle.\n\nMusic is also important to Bontoc life, and is usually played during ceremonies. Songs and chants are accompanied by nose flutes, gongs, bamboo mouth organ, and Jew’s harp. Wealthy families make use of jewelry, which are commonly made of gold, glass, agate, or shells, to show their status.\n\nThe Bontoc take pride in their kinship ties and oneness as a group (\"sinpangili\") based on affiliations, history together against intruders, and community rituals for agriculture and matters which affect the entire province, like natural disasters. Kinship groups have two main functions: controlling property and regulating marriage. However, they are also important for the mutual cooperation of the group’s members.\n\nThere are generally three social classes in Bontoc society, the \"kakachangyan\" (rich), the \"wad-ay ngachanna\" (middle-class), and the \"lawa\" (poor).\n\nAnthropologists believe that the Bontoc descended from Indonesian and Malay immigrants, however Bontocs believe that they have lived in their present area since time immemorial. Today, they are distributed all over the Philippines. They are the second largest group in the Mountain Province.\n\nThe Ibaloi group inhabits the southeastern part of Benguet Province. The area is rich in mineral resources like copper, gold, pyrite, and limestone. Plants and animals are also abundant in the forests and mountain areas, and there is an extensive water system that includes the Bued, Agno, and Amburayan rivers. Mount Pulag, the second highest mountain of the Philippines, is found in their territory and is a culturally important area as well, considered the place where spirits join their ancestors.\n\nThe Ibaloi are distributed in the mountain valleys and settlements. Their language is called either \"Inibaloi\" or \"Nabaloi\". Their ancestors are likely to have originated from the Lingayen and Ilocos coasts, who then migrated into the Southern Cordillera range before settling.\n\nThe Ibaloi have a rich material culture, most notably their mummification process, which makes use of saltwater to prevent organ decomposition. Pounded guava and patani leaves are applied to the corpse to prevent maggot or worm infestation while the body dries, the process taking anywhere from two months to even a year until the body is hardened.\n\nThe Ibaloi build their houses near their farms. These are usually built on stilts and contain only one room with no windows. Pine trees are usually used to build the houses, especially for wealthy families, while bark bamboo and cogon grass are used by the poor. For cooking, they use pots are made of copper, and food compartments and utensils made of wood. Baskets and coconut husks are also used as containers. Traditional weapons of the Ibalois are the spear, shield, bow and arrow, and war club, though they are rarely used in present times. The Ibaloi also employ cutting tools like knives, farm tools, and complete pounding implements for rice: mortars (round or rectangular, for different purposes) and numerous pestles, carved from sturdy tree trunks and pine branches.\n\nMusic is also important among the Ibaloi, with the Jew’s harp, nose flute, native guitar, bamboo striking instruments, drums, gongs, and many others. They are considered sacred, and must always be played for a reason.\n\nOlder Ibaloi people may have tattooed arms as a sign of prestige.\n\nThe Ikalahan is a small group distributed amongst the mountain ranges of Sierra Madre, the Caraballo, and the eastern part of the Cordillera mountain range. The main population resides in the Nueva Vizcaya province, with Kayapa as the center. They are considered to be part of the Igorot (mountain people) but distinguish themselves with the name Ikalahan, the name taken from the forest trees that grow in the Caraballo Mountain.\n\nThey are among the least studied ethnic groups, thus their early history is unknown, however studies by Keesing (1962) suggests that, like other groups in the mountains, they fled from the lowlands to escape Spanish persecution. Rice (1974) however says that, according to Kalahan literature and language, they may have descended from Proto-Benguet people from the southern end of the Cordillera Mountain ranges.\n\nIkalahan proudly embrace their culture with its strong family ties and association with the forest, and modern Ikalahan are known for their community-based management of forests. Like many indigenous groups, they face the threat of losing their ancestral lands to commercial developments.\n\nIkalahan started out as hunter-gatherers, but now practice swidden (“slash-and-burn”) farming, with especially developed technology for the production of their staple food, camote, and of ginger. These technologies are supported by their customs. Originally they only lived together in small groups of houses, but now gather in larger residential communities in order to facilitate children’s education. Many now reside in the Kalahan reserve, with the Imugan community the largest.\n\nIkalahan houses, traditionally made for one nuclear family, have of reeds (\"pal-ot\") or cogon for roofs, barks or slabs of trees for the walls, and palm strips for the floor. The houses are traditionally rectangular and raised from the ground, with one main room for general activities and few or no windows. There is usually a separate room for visitors or single family members only, opposite the kitchen area. Shelves keep household utensils, including wooden bowls and camote trays made of rattan. Camote peelings or rejects are fed to the pigs, which are herded under the living area or in a sty near the house.\n\nThe Ikalahan, like many ethnic groups, enjoy using musical instruments in celebration, most of which are made out of bamboo. Gongs are the primary instruments used, and are complemented by drums. They also use a native guitar, or \"galdang\", and a vibrating instrument called the \"pakgong\" played by striking.\n\nFor clothing, Ikalahan men wear a loincloth or G-string, and carry backpacks made out of deer hide. Men almost always carry a bolo when leaving the house. Women wear woven skirts around the waist, made up of flaps of different color combinations. They wear a blouse from the same material.\n\nIfugaos, commonly known as Igorots in Filipino, are an ethnolinguistic group majorly found in Ifugao province, which is located in the heart of Cordillera. The province is one of the smallest provinces in the Philippines with an area of only 251,778 hectares, or about 0.8% of the total Philippine land area. It has a temperate climate and is rich in mineral and forest products. It is also famous for its Banaue Rice Terraces which became one of the main tourist attractions in the country.\n\nThe term \"Igorot\" or \"Ygolote\" was the term used by Spanish conquerors for mountain people. The Ifugaos, however, prefer the name \"Ifugao\" which came from the word \"ipugo\"(\"human beings\" in English). Although majority of them already converted to Roman Catholic from their original animistic religion, from their mythology, they believed that they descended from Wigan and Bugan, who are the children of Bakkayawan and Bugan of the Skyworld (\"Kabunyan\"). Scholars, however, have differing theories about the true origin of Ifugaos. The two most prevailing theories are that they either came from the Magat area because of the Spanish military penetration there before, or from the western Mountain Province if you base it on the similarities of their language and culture. The Ifugao popular epic, \"The Hudhud of Dinulawan\" and \"Bugan of Gonhadan\", however, favors the theory that they came from the Magat Area.\n\nAs of 1995, the population of the Ifugaos was counted to be 131,635. Although the majority of them are still in Ifugao province, some of them already transferred to Baguio City, where they worked as woodcarvers, and to other parts of the Cordillera region.\n\nThey are divided into subgroups based on the differences in dialects, traditions, and design/color of costumes. The main subgroups are Ayangan, Kalangaya, and Tuwali. Furthermore, the Ifugao society is divided into 3 social classes: the \"kadangyans\" or the aristocrats, the \"tagus\" or the middle class, and the \"nawotwots\" or the poor ones. The \"kadangyans\" sponsor the prestige rituals called \"hagabi\" and \"uyauy\" and this separates them from the \"tagus\" who cannot sponsor feasts but are economically well off. The \"nawotwots\" are those who have limited land properties and are usually hired by the upper classes to do work in the fields and other services.\n\nThe Ifugaos host a number of similarities with the Bontocs in terms of agriculture, but the Ifugao tend to have more scattered settlements, and recognize their affiliation mostly towards direct kin in households closer to their fields \n\nFrom a person’s birth to his death, the Ifugaos follow a lot of traditions. \"Pahang\" and \"palat di oban\" are performed to a mother to ensure safe delivery. After delivery, no visitors are allowed to enter the house until \"among\" is performed when the baby is given a name. \"Kolot\" and \"balihong\" are then performed to ensure the health and good characteristics of the boy or the girl, respectively. As they grow older, they sleep in exclusive dormitories because it is considered indecent for siblings of different genders to sleep in the same house. The men are the ones who hunt, recite myths, and work in the fields. Women also work in the fields, aside from managing the homes and reciting ballads. Betrothals are also common, especially among the wealthy class; and like other Filipinos they perform several customs in marriage like \"bubun\" (providing a pig to the woman’s family). Lastly, the Ifugaos don’t mourn for the elderly who dies, as well as for the baby or the mother who died in a conception. This is to prevent the same event from happening again in the family. Also, the Ifugaos believe in life after death so those who are murdered are given a ritual called \"opa\" to force their souls into the place where his ancestors dwell.\n\nThe Isnegs are native in Apayao province, which was formerly a sub-province of Mountain Province, but are also found in portions of Abra, Ilocos Norte, & Kalinga. Apayao has an area of 397,720 hectares and is typographically divided into two parts: the Upper Apayao that is mountainous, and the Lower Apayao that is generally flat with rolling mountains and plateaus.\n\nIn 1923, they were the last ethnic group to be conquered by the American colonialists. Before, they had no collective name. Instead, they referred to themselves based on their residence or whether they lived: upstream (\"Imandaya\") or downstream (\"Imallod\"). At present, they are commonly known as Isnegs, which came from an Ilocano word \"itneg\" that means \"Inhabitants of the Tineg River\". Some of them, however, still call themselves as \"Apayaos\". Majority of them live along the Apayao-Abulug River, Matalag River, and the small rivers on the hillsides of Ilocos Norte and Abra.\n\nBecause there was no political or ward system, the kinship groups and family clans became the central social organizations and were usually led by the husbands. Polygamy is allowed, but depends on the capacity of the husband to support the family. Like other ethnic groups, they also follow a lot of taboos. These taboos vary from place to place. A pregnant woman, for example, is discouraged to eat some kinds of sugarcane, banana, and the soft meat of sprouting coconut to have a normal conception. In the past, twins were also believed to be unlucky, so whenever twins were born, they would let the weaker twin die. Also, if the mother dies upon giving birth, the child is also left to die and is usually buried with the mother. Unlike the Ifugaos, the Isnegs don’t follow rituals on the adolescence of the child. They, however, have rituals on marriage, like the \"amoman\" (or the present-day \"pamamanhikan\"), and death, like the \"mamanwa\" which is done by the widowers.\n\nThe Isnegs are aesthetically-inclined. In ceremonies, women wear a lot of colourful ornaments and clothings, and men wear G-strings (usually of blue color) and \"bado\" (upper garment). Men don’t wear pendants but they wear an ornament called \"sipattal\", made of shells and beads, used only on special occasions. They also practice tattooing which is done by rubbing soot on the wounds caused by the needles. Furthermore, rice was their main crop. Fishing was also common as they were living along bodies of water.\n\nThe Kalingas are mainly found in Kalinga province which has an area of 3,282.58 sq. km. Some of them, however, already migrated to Mountain Province, Apayao, Cagayan, and Abra. As of 1995, they were counted to be 105,083, not including those who have migrated outside the Cordillera region.\n\nThe name \"Kalinga\" came from the Ibanag and Gaddang term \"kalinga\", which means \"headhunter\". They can be divided into three sub-cultures and geographical position: Balbalan (north); Pasil, Lubuagan, and Tinglayan (south); and Tanudan (east). They can also be divided based on their dialects: Guinaang, Lubuagan, Punukpuk, Tabuk, Tinglayan, and Tanudan.\n\nLike other ethnic groups, families and kinship systems are also important in the social organizations of Kalingas. They are, however, stratified into two economic classes only which are determined by the number of their rice fields, working animals, and heirlooms: the \"kapos\" (poor) and the \"baknang\" (wealthy). Politically, the \"mingol\" and the \"papangat\" have the highest status. The \"mingols\" are those who have killed many in headhunting and the \"papangats\" are those former \"mingols\" who assumed leadership after the disappearance of headhunting. They are usually the peacemakers, and the people ask advice from them, so it is important that they are wise and have good oratorical ability.\n\nLike the other ethnic groups, they also follow a lot of customs and traditions. For example, pregnant women and their husbands are not allowed to eat beef, cow’s milk, and dog meat. They must also avoid streams and waterfalls as these cause harm to unborn children. Other notable traditions are the \"ngilin\" (period of restriction of household activities after the birth of the child) and the \"kontad\" (ritual performed to the child to avoid harms in the future). Betrothals are also common, even as early as birth, but one may break this engagement if he/she is not in favour of it. Upon death, sacrifices are also made in honour of the spirit of the dead and \"kolias\" is celebrated after one year of mourning period. The Kalingas, along with the Bontocs, the Kankana-ey, and the Ifugao follow the system of \"tayan\", which relates to the heredity of communal property, or lands. They are also known for building their houses on treetops, for the use of swidden farming, and for the uniquely shaped Kalinga head ax, which was used both as a weapon and a farming implement.\n\nKalinga men wear \"ba-ag\" (loincloths) while the women wear \"saya\" (colourful garment covering the waist down to the feet). The women are also tattooed on their arms up to their shoulders and wear colourful ornaments like bracelets, earrings, and necklaces, especially on the day of festivities.\n\nThe Northern Kankana-eys live in Sagada and Besau, west of Mountain province, and whom Dr. H. Otley Beyer believed to have originated from a migrating group from Asia who landed on the coasts of Pangasinan before moving to Cordillera. The Northern Kankana-eys are tall and well proportioned, have a more aquiline nose, lighter skin color and are quick on their feet. Their smallest social unit is the \"sinba-ey\", which includes the father, mother and child. The \"sinba-eys\" make up the \"dap-ay\"/\"ebgan\" which is the ward. Their society is divided into two classes: the \"kadangyan\" (rich), who are the leaders and who inherit their power through lineage or intermarriage, and the \"kado\" (poor).\n\nThe Northern Kankana-eys believe in many supernatural beliefs and omens, and in gods and spirits like the \"anito\" (soul of the dead) and nature spirits.\n\nThey also have various rituals, such as the rituals for courtship and marriage and death and burial. The courtship and marriage process of the Northern Kankana-eys starts with the man visiting the woman of his choice and serenading her using an \"awiding\" (harp) or a nose flute. If the parents agree to their marriage, they exchange work for a day, i.e. the man brings logs or bundled firewood as a sign of his sincerity, the woman works on the man’s father’s field with a female friend. They then undergo the preliminary marriage ritual (\"pasya\") and exchange food. Then comes the marriage celebration itself (\"dawak\"/\"bayas\")inclusive of the \"segep\" (which means \"to enter\"), \"pakde\" (sacrifice), \"betbet\" (butchering of pig for omens), \"playog\"/\"kolay\" (marriage ceremony proper), \"tebyag\" (merrymaking), \"mensupot\" (gift giving), \"sekat di tawid\" (giving of inheritance), and \"buka\"/\"inga\" (last leg of the marriage ritual). The married couple cannot separate once a child is born, and adultery is forbidden in their society as it is believed to bring misfortune and illness upon the adulterer. On the other hand, the Northern kankana-eys honor their dead by keeping vigil and performing the rituals \"sangbo\" (offering of pigs and 3 ducks), \"baya-o\" (singing of a dirge by three men), \"menbaya-o\" (elegy) and \"sedey\" (offering of pig). They finish off the burial ritual with \"dedeg\" (song of the dead), and then, the sons and grandsons carry the body to its resting place.\n\nThe Northern Kankana-eys have rich material culture among which is the four types of houses: the \"inhagmang\", \"binang-iyan\", \"tinokbobo\" and \"tinabla\". Their men wear rectangular woven cloths wrapped around their waist to cover the buttocks and the groin. The women wear native woven skirts that cover their lower body from waist to knees and is held by a thick belt (\"bagket\").\n\nTheir household is sparsely furnished with only a \"bangkito\"/\"tokdowan\", \"po-ok\" (small box for storage of rice and wine), clay pots, and \"sokong\" (carved bowl). Their baskets are made of woven rattan and come in various shapes and sizes.\n\nThe Kankana-eys have three main weapons, the bolo (\"ganig\"), the axe (\"wasay\") and the spear (\"balbeg\"), which they previously used to kill with but now serve practical purposes in their livelihood. They also developed tools for more efficient way of doing their work like the \"saged\" (harrow), \"alado\" (plow dragged by carabao), \"sinowan\" and \"kagitgit\" (for digging).\n\nFor a living, the Northern Kankana-eys take part in barter and trade in kind, agriculture (usually on terraces), camote/sweet potato farming, slash-and-burn/swidden farming, hunting, fishing and food gathering, handicraft and other cottage industry. They have a simple political life and are governed by \"Dap-ay\"/\"abong\" and experience a certain degree of autonomy. The council of elders, known as the \"Amam-a\", are a group of old, married men expert in custom law and lead in the decision-making for the village.Through time the village has maintained a perfect balance between modern and traditional way of living. The modifications on the culture of the Northern Kankana-eys were brought about the interaction with other villages with different customs and the trade relations with the lowland traders. There is also some external influence from the arrival of missionaries bringing Anglican and Pentecostal religions, towards which some have converted. Despite the modifications, the culture of the Northern Kankana-eys remain vibrant and alive.\n\nOriginally from Banao and Ampontoc, the Southern Kankana-eys are one of the ethnolinguistic groups in the Cordillera. They live in the mountainous regions of Mountain Province and Benguet, more specifically in the municipalities of Tidian, Bauko, Sabangan, Bakun, Kibungan and Mankayan. They are predominantly a nuclear family type (\"sinbe-ey\"), which are either patri-local or matri-local, composed of the husband, wife and their children. The kinship group of the Southern Kankana-eys consists of his descent group and, once he is married, his affinal kinsmen. Their society is divided into two social classes based primarily on the ownership of land: The rich (\"baknang\") and the poor (\"abiteg\"). The \"baknang\" are the primary landowners to whom the \"abiteg\" render their services to. The Mankayan Kankana-eys, however, has no clear distinction between the \"baknang\" and the \"abiteg\" and all have equal access to resources such as the copper and gold mines.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the Southern Kankana-eys do not worship idols and images. The carved images in their homes only serve decorative purposes. They believe in the existence of deities, the highest among which is \"Adikaila\" of the Skyworld whom they believe created all things. Next in the hierarchy is the \"Kabunyan\", who are the gods and goddesses of the Skyworld. They also believe in the spirits of ancestors (\"ap-apo\") and the earth spirits they call \"anito\". They are very superstitious and believe that performing rituals and ceremonies help deter misfortunes and calamities. Some of these rituals are \"pedit\" (to bring good luck to newlyweds), \"pasang\" (cure sterility and sleeping sickness, particularly drowsiness) and \"pakde\" (cleanse community from death-causing evil spirits).\n\nThe Southern Kankana-eys have a long process for courtship and marriage which starts when the man makes his intentions of marrying the woman known to her. Next is the \"sabangan\", when the couple makes their wish to marry known to their family.The man offers firewood to the father of the woman, while the woman offers firewood to the man’s father. The parents then talk about the terms of the marriage, including the bride price to be paid by the man’s family. On the day of the marriage, the relatives of both parties offer gifts to the couple, and a pig is butchered to have its bile inspected for omens which would show if they should go on with the wedding. The wedding day for the Southern Kankana-eys is an occasion for merrymaking and usually lasts until the next day. Though married, the bride and groom are not allowed consummate their marriage and must remain separated until such a time that they move to their own separate home.\n\nThe funeral ritual of the Southern Kankana-eys lasts up to ten days, when the family honors their dead by chanting dirges and vigils and sacrificing a pig for each day of the vigil. Five days after the burial of the dead, those who participated in the burial take a bath in a river together, butcher a chicken, then offer a prayer to the soul of the dead.\n\nThe Southern Kankana-eys have different types of houses among which are \"binang-iyan\" (box-like compartment), \"apa\" or \"inalpa\" (smaller than \"bingang-iyan\"), \"inalteb\" (has a gabled roof and shorter eaves allowing for the installation of windows and other opening at the side), \"allao\" (a temporary or casual structure), \"at-ato\" or \"dap-ay\" (long, low gable-roofed structure with only a single door for entrance and exit). Men traditionally wear a G-string (\"wanes\") around the waist and between the legs which is tightened at the back. Both ends hang loose at the front and back to provide additional cover. Men also wear a woven blanket for an upper garment and sometimes a headband, usually colored red like the G-string. The women, on the other hand, wear a \"tapis\", a skirt wrapped around to cover from the waist to the knees held together by a belt (\"bagket\") or tucked in the upper edges usually color white with occasional dark blue color. As adornments, both men and women wear bead leglets, copper or shell earrings and beads of copper coin. They also sport tattoos which serve as body ornaments and “garments”.\n\nSouthern Kankana-eys are economically involved in hunting and foraging (their chief livelihood), agriculture, fishing, animal domestication, trade, mining, weaving and pottery in their day-to-day activities to meet their needs. The leadership structure is largely based on land ownership, thus the more well-off control the community’s resources. The village elders (amam-a) who act as arbiters and jurors have the duty to settlements between conflicting members of the community, facilitate discussion among the villagers concerning the welfare of the community, and lead in the observance of rituals.\n\nThere is no more pure Southern Kankana-ey culture because of culture change that modified the customs and traditions of the people. The socio-cultural changes are largely due to a combination of factors which include the change in the local government system when the Spaniards came, the introduction of Christianity, the education system that widened the perspective of the individuals of the community, and the encounters with different people and ways of life through trade and commerce.\n\nThe Tingguinians live in the mountainous area of Abra in northwestern Luzon who descended from immigrants from Kalinga, Apayao, and the Northern Kankana-ey. They are large in stature, have mongoloid eyes, aquiline nose, and are effective farmers. They refer to themselves as \"Itneg\", though the Spaniards called them \"Tingguian\" when they came in the Philippines because they are mountain dwellers. The Tingguians are further divided into nine distinct subgroups which are the Adasen, Mabaka, Gubang, Banao, Binongon, Danak, Moyodan, Dawangan, and Ilaud. Wealth and material possessions determine the social standing of a family or person. Despite the divide of social status, there is no sharp distinction between rich and poor. Wealth is inherited but the society is open for social mobility of the citizens by virtue of hard work. Medium is the only distinct group separation in the society but even then it is only during ceremonial periods.\n\nThe Itnegs’ marriage are arranged by the parents and are usually between distant relatives in order to keep the family close knit and the family wealth within the kinship group. The parents select a bride for their son when he is six to eight years old, and the proposal is done to the parents of the girl. If accepted, the engagement is sealed by tying beads around the girl’s waist as a sign of engagement. A bride price is also paid to the bride’s family, half during the \"pakalon\" and the rest during the actual wedding. No celebration accompanies the Itneg wedding and the guests leave right after the ceremony.\n\nThe Itnegs dress much like the Southern Kankana-eys. The females dress in a wrap-around skirt that reaches to the knees and fastened by an elaborately decorated belt. They also wear short sleeved jacket on special occasions. The men, on the other hand, wear a G-string made of woven cloth (\"balibas\"). On special occasions, the men also wear a long-sleeved jacket. They also wear a belt where they fasten their knife and a bamboo hat with a low, dome-shaped top. Beads are the primary adornment of the Tingguians and a sign of wealth. Also, tattooing is commonly practiced. The Tingguians have two general types of housing. The first is a 2-3 room-dwelling surrounded by a porch and the other is a one-room house with a porch in front. Their houses are usually made of bamboo and cogon. A common feature of a Tingguian home with wooden floors is a corner with bamboo slats as flooring where mothers usually give birth.\n\nThe Tingguians use weapons for hunting, headhunting, and building a house, among others. Some examples of their weapons and implements are the lance or spear (\"pika\"), shield (\"kalasag\"), head axe (\"aliwa\"). Foremost among all these weapons and implements is the bolo which the Tangguians are rarely seen without.\n\nThe traditional leadership in the Tangguian community is held by \"panglakayen\" (old men), who compose a council of leaders representing each \"purok\" or settlement. The \"panglakayen\" are chosen for their wisdom and eagerness to protect the community’s interest. Agriculture is the dominant activity for the Itnegs in Abra as the landscape is favorable for such trade. Tingguians are also involved in livestock raising, fishing, hunting and foraging, and crafts as source of living.\n\nThe Itnegs are religious beings who believe in believe in the existence of numerous supernatural powerful beings. They believe in spirits and deities, the greatest of which they believe to be is Kadaklan who lives up in the sky and who created the earth, the moon, the stars, and the sun. The Itnegs believe in life after death, which is in a place they call \"maglawa\". They take special care to clean and adorn their dead to prepare them for the journey to \"maglawa\".\n\nThe Tingguians still practice their traditional ways. Socio-cultural changes started when the Spanish conquistadors ventured to expand their reach to the settlements of Abra. The Spaniards brought with them their culture some of which the Tangguians borrowed. More changes in their culture took place with the coming of the Americans and the introduction education and catholic and Protestant proselytization.\n\n"}

{"id": "5550461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5550461", "title": "Frege's puzzles", "text": "Frege's puzzles\n\nFrege's puzzles are puzzles about the semantics of proper names, although related puzzles also arise in the case of indexicals. Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) introduced the puzzle at the beginning of his article \"Über Sinn und Bedeutung\" (\"On Sense and Reference\") in 1892 in one of the most influential articles in analytic philosophy and philosophy of language.\n\nThe term \"Frege's puzzle\" is commonly applied to two related problems. One is a problem about identity statements that Frege raised at the beginning of \"On Sense and Reference\", and another concerns propositional attitude reports. For the first problem, consider the following two sentences:\n\n(1) Hesperus is Hesperus.\n\n(2) Hesperus is Phosphorus.\n\nEach of these sentences is true, since 'Hesperus' refers to the same object as 'Phosphorus' (the planet Venus). Nonetheless, (1) and (2) seem to differ in their meaning or what Frege called \"cognitive value\". (1) is just a truth of logic that can be known a priori, whereas (2) records an empirical truth that was discovered by astronomers. The problem, however, is that proper names are often taken to have no meaning beyond their reference (a view often associated with John Stuart Mill). But this seems to imply that the two statements mean the same thing, or have the same cognitive value.\n\nFrege proposed to resolve this puzzle by postulating a second level of meaning besides reference in the form of what he called sense: a difference in the mode of presentation or the way an object can be \"given\" to us. Thus 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' have the same reference, but differ in sense because they present Venus in different ways.\n\nThe second puzzle concerns propositional attitude reports, such as belief reports. Ordinarily, coreferring names are substitutable salva veritate, that is, without change in truth value. For example, if 'Hesperus is bright' is true then 'Phosphorus is bright' is also true given that 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' refer to the same planet. But now consider the following argument:\n\n(3) Alex believes Hesperus is visible in the evening.\n\n(4) Hesperus = Phosphorus.\n\n(5) Alex believes Phosphorus is visible in the evening.\n\nThis argument appears to be invalid: even if (3) and (4) are true, (5) could be false. If Alex is not aware that Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same planet, then it seems that he could believe that Hesperus is visible in the evening while rejecting the claim that Phosphorus is visible in the evening (perhaps he thinks Phosphorus, the morning star, is only visible in the morning). The principle that coreferring names are substitutable \"salva veritate\" thus appears to fail in the context of belief reports (and similarly for other propositional attitude reports).\n\nFrege again proposed to solve this problem by appeal to his distinction between sense and reference. In particular, he held that when a proper name occurs in the context of an attitude report, its reference shifts to its ordinary sense: thus 'Phosphorus', for example, denotes the planet Venus when it occurs in the sentence 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' or in an identity sentence like (4), but when it occurs embedded in an attitude report like (5) it denotes its ordinary \"sense.\"\n\nFrege's puzzle has received a great deal of attention since the attacks on the descriptivist theory of names mounted in the 1970s and 1980s by philosophers such as Keith Donnellan, Saul Kripke, Ruth Barcan Marcus, Hilary Putnam, and David Kaplan. In the wake of these attacks on descriptivism, many philosophers embraced the Millian or direct-reference view of proper names, according to which the meaning of a name is simply its referent. As noted above, this Millian view has the result that (1) and (2) express the same proposition. Similarly, the embedded sentences 'Hesperus is visible in the evening' and 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' from (3) and (5) express the same proposition. It therefore looks like (3) and (5) cannot differ in truth value since they attribute belief in one and the same proposition.\n\nIn view of this problem, many philosophers of language have attempted to work out a solution to the puzzle within the confines of direct-reference theories of proper names. Some of these philosophers include Nathan Salmon (e.g. in \"Frege's puzzle\" and \"Content, Cognition, and Communication\"), Howard Wettstein (e.g. in \"Has Semantics Rested on a Mistake?\"), Scott Soames, David Kaplan, John Perry (e.g. in \"Reference and Reflexivity\"), and Joseph Almog.\n\n"}

It commemorates Heyward (sometimes spelled \"Hayward\") Shepherd (1825–October 16, 1859), a free black man, who was the first person killed during John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry.\nHeyward Shepherd was a free black man who lived in Winchester, Virginia, about from Harpers Ferry. He owned property there, a small house, and had a wife and five children, according to the 1860 census. \"It is unclear whether Shepherd was born a free man or was an emancipated slave because various anecdotal references present different opinions on that subject.\"\n\nHe had a job as a porter or baggage handler with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and worked on the trains going back and forth through Harpers Ferry, an important rail junction. When the stationmaster was absent, he was in charge of the station. During the early hours of the raid on October 16, 1859, he recognized Brown's party, and tried to warn the town instead of helping the liberators. The raiders unexpectedly met Heyward, and ordered him to stop when he turned to run. When he failed to stop, he was shot in the back and/or the head, and killed. He was buried in the Winchester-Fairfax Colored Cemetery, without a grave marker. He was \"accorded public honors by the state of Virginia, his funeral being attended by a detachment of the Virginia State militia.\"\n\nIn 1931 a monument to Shepherd was erected by both the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. The text of the granite monument read: On the night of October 16, 1859, Heyward Shepherd, an industrious and respected colored freeman, was mortally wounded by John Brown's raiders, in pursuance of his duties as an employee of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, he became the first victim of this attempted insurrection. This boulder is erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans as a memorial to Heyward Shepherd, exemplifying the character and faithfulness of thousands of Negros who under many temptations throughout subsequent years of war. So conducted themselves that no stain was left upon a record which is the peculiar heritage of the American people, and an everlasting tribute to the best in both races.\n\nThe monument was immediately challenged by many as perpetuating the \"faithful slave\" concept of slavery as a justification for the practice.\n\nThe NAACP responded by preparing a plaque to be displayed at Storer College in Harpers Ferry, where the firehouse used by John Brown as a fort had been placed. The president of the college refused to allow the plaque to be mounted because of the militant text. In 2006 the plaque was finally placed on the side of the firehouse. The text of the plaque reads: HERE JOHN BROWN AIMED AT HUMAN SLAVERY A BLOW THAT WOKE A GUILTY NATION. WITH HIM FOUGHT SEVEN SLAVES AND SONS OF SLAVES. OVER HIS CRUCIFIED CORPSE MARCHED 200,000 BLACK SOLDIERS AND 4,000,000 FREEDMEN SINGING \"JOHN BROWN'S BODY LIES A-MOULDERING IN THE GRAVE BUT HIS SOUL GOES MARCHING ON!\" IN GRATITUDE THIS TABLET IS ERECTED THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE MAY 21, 1932\n\nA plaque to contexualize the original 1931 monument was placed in 1955 by the National Park Service. The text of the plaque read: John Brown’s raid on the armory at Harpers Ferry caused the death of four townspeople. One of those died in the fighting was Heyward Shepherd, a railroad baggagemaster and a free black. Although the true identity of his assailant is uncertain, Shepherd soon became a symbol of the \"faithful servant\" among those who deplored Brown’s action against the traditional southern way of life. This monument, placed here in 1931, reflects those traditional views.\n\nAnother plaque was installed near the 1931 monument to place the monument in context by the National Park Service. It reads: On October 17, 1859, abolitionist John Brown attacked Harpers Ferry to launch a war against slavery. Heyward Shepherd, a free African-American railroad baggage master, was shot and killed by Brown’s men shortly after midnight. Seventy-two years later, on October 10, 1931, a crowd estimated to 300 whites and 100 blacks gathered to unveil and dedicate the Shepherd Monument. During the ceremony, voices rose to praise and denounce the monument. Conceived around the turn of the century, the monument endured controversy. In 1905, the United Daughters of the Confederacy stated that erecting the monument would influence for good the present and coming generations, and prove that the people of the South who owned slaves valued and respected their good qualities as no one else ever did or will do.\n\n"}

The Institute of Colonial Studies had been established in 1945. Its antecedent had been the training courses at the University of Oxford for both the probationers of the Indian Civil Service and the Colonial Services (such as the Tropical African Service Course). More directly it had developed out of the University’s response to a proposed expansion, to be made in the post-war years, in the training of colonial civil servants. These proposals were eventually published as the Report on Post-War Training for the Colonial Service (Devonshire Report, 1946). Much of the drafting of the report had been undertaken by Margery Perham, then Reader in Colonial Administration at Oxford, who had also been influential in establishing the Committee for Colonial Studies, the Institute’s supervising body, in 1943. The Institute was set up under the directorship of Perham, assisted by Col. F.B.H. Drummond as administrative secretary who also acted as secretary to the Committee. In 1948 both Perham and Drummond resigned and the Institute’s affairs were placed in the hands of a Committee of Management, consisting of the Beit Professor of Commonwealth History (then, of the History of the British Empire), the Registrar and the Reader in Colonial Administration, who continued to run the Institute until Bullard's appointment as Director in 1951. The Institute, initially located at 10 Bardwell Road, Oxford, moved in 1948 to premises in South Parks Road, in 1951 to 10 Keble Road, and in 1961 to Queen Elizabeth House (21 St Giles).

{"id": "21786696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21786696", "title": "Kintsugi", "text": "Kintsugi\n\n, also known as , is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum, a method similar to the \"maki-e \"technique. As a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.\n\nLacquerware is a longstanding tradition in Japan, and at some point \"kintsugi\" may have been combined with \"maki-e\" as a replacement for other ceramic repair techniques. While the process is associated with Japanese craftsmen, the technique was also applied to ceramic pieces of other origins including China, Vietnam, and Korea.\n\n\"Kintsugi\" became closely associated with ceramic vessels used for \"chanoyu\" (Japanese tea ceremony). One theory is that \"kintsugi\" may have originated when Japanese \"shōgun\" Ashikaga Yoshimasa sent a damaged Chinese tea bowl back to China for repairs in the late 15th century. When it was returned, repaired with ugly metal staples, it may have prompted Japanese craftsmen to look for a more aesthetic means of repair. Collectors became so enamored with the new art that some were accused of deliberately smashing valuable pottery so it could be repaired with the gold seams of \"kintsugi\".\n\nAs a philosophy, kintsugi can be seen to have similarities to the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, an embracing of the flawed or imperfect. Japanese aesthetics values marks of wear by the use of an object. This can be seen as a rationale for keeping an object around even after it has broken and as a justification of kintsugi itself, highlighting the cracks and repairs as simply an event in the life of an object rather than allowing its service to end at the time of its damage or breakage.\n\nKintsugi can relate to the Japanese philosophy of , which encompasses the concepts of non-attachment, acceptance of change, and fate as aspects of human life.\n\nThere are a few major styles or types of kintsugi:\n\nStaple repair is a similar technique used to repair broken ceramic pieces, where small holes are drilled on either side of a crack and metal staples are bent to hold the pieces together. Staple repair was used in Europe (in ancient Greece, England and Russia among others) and China as a repair technique for particularly valuable pieces.\n\nKintsugi is the general concept of highlighting or emphasizing imperfections, visualizing mends and seams as an additive or an area to celebrate or focus on, rather than absence or missing pieces. Modern artists experiment with the ancient technique as a means of analyzing the idea of loss, synthesis, and improvement through destruction and repair or rebirth.\n\nWhile originally ignored as a separate art form, kintsugi and related repair methods have been featured at exhibitions at the Freer Gallery at the Smithsonian, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University Ithaca NY, USA.\n\nAuthenticity continues to ignite interest among tourism and marketing scholars and brand heritage can induce the feeling of authentic experience and increase customer retention. In particular kintsugi implies that the authentic is that which displays and values its true, dynamic relation to history. By highlighting that the authentic object or site is that which, despite the ravages of time, retains cultural value (be that local, national, and/or international), site managers can re-figure and promote a conception of authenticity to tourists.\n\n\n\n"}

From his early years Potapov showed interest to ethnography of his native land, travelling to study the culture of Altaians with a known Altaist Andrey V. Anokhin. He visited Alatai in 1925 to gather ethnographic material on behalf of the Russian Geographical Society. He graduated from the geographical department of the Leningrad State University with a major in ethnography in 1928. Here he had studied with Lev Sternberg, Vladimir Bogoraz, Dmitrii Zelenin, Sergei Rudenko. Alexander Samoylovich, and Sergey Malov tutored him in Türkic languages.\n\nFollowing his graduation Potapov was appointed a head of scientific department in an Uzbek research institute, leading ethnographic expeditions to various areas of Uzbekistan.\n\nDoctor of Historical sciences, professor, \"Tuva ASSR Honored Worker of Science\", an outstanding researcher of history and culture of Altaians, Shors, Khakases, Tuvinians and other peoples of southern Siberia. He continued to collect material, publishing his first major text \"Essays on Shoria history\" in 1931 and continued with his post graduate work at the USSR Academy of Sciences. He accepted Marxism-Leninism and its application to ethnography. After completing his postgraduate study, Potapov headed the Siberia and ethnography department of the State Ethnographical Museum of the USSR peoples in the Kunstkamera and conducted research work at the USSR Academy of Science's History of Material Culture Institute.\n\nIn 1939, Potapov gained a PhD in Historical Sciences, presenting the monograph \"Relicts of primitive-communal system of Altai peoples\". By that time Potapov had published about 30 works, including a number of monographs. At the beginning of the World War II Potapov worked on the evacuation of museum valuables, moving with the museum collection to Novosibirsk in 1942. In 1946 he published \"Altaians\" and was appointed professor. he then headed the Khakass ethnographic expedition, spending the next 11 years with various expeditions to Altai, Shoria, Khakassia and Tuva. He broadened his research materials on shamanism incorporating non-soviet sources. Potapov focussed on pre-Islam beliefs of peoples of Central Asia, ethnogenesis, ethnographic materials, archival, written and archeological sources.\n\nIn 1948 Potapov published \"Essays on history of Altaians\" (Novosibirsk, 1948), which was awarded with \"Stalin\" (later renamed \"State\") premium. He contributed to \"Essays on the USSR history\", \"History of the USSR\", the five-volume \"History of Siberia\" and published \"Brief Esasay on culture and a life of Altaians\" (Gorno-Altaisk, 1948), \"Brief Essays on history and ethnography of Khakases (17th–19th centuries)\" (Abakan, 1952), \"Origin and formation of Khakass nation\" (Abakan, 1957), \"Ethnic Composition and Origin of Altaians\" (Leningrad, 1969), \"Essays on native life of Tuvinians\" (Moscow, 1969).\n\nFrom 1957 to 1966 the Tuva Archeological Ethnographical Expedition worked on studies of ethnogenesis and history of Tuvinians. working with A.D. Grach, S.I. Weinstein and V.P. Diakonova, he edited the three-volume \"Works of Tuva complex archeological ethnographical expedition\". Participants wrote a collective monograph \"History of Tuva\" (Vol. 1). In 1956 Potapov wrote chapters on 'Altaians', 'Khakases', 'Tuvinians' and 'Shors' for the \"Peoples of Siberia\" in \"Nations of the world\" series, published also in English by the University of Chicago. Potapov participated in the 23rd and 25th congresses of Orientalists, and in the 6th and 7th congresses of anthropologists and ethnographers (Paris, 1960).\n\nPotapov created a scientific school studying the peoples of Siberia, especially the Sayan-Altai region, and prepared 48 PhD in sciences. A special scientific contribution was his work \"Altai shamanism\" (1991) with a rich collection of material brought from uncountable field research materials. Potapov joined the names of N.N. Poppe (1970), V.I. Tsintsius (1972), A.N. Kononov (1976), N.A. Baskakov (1980), A.M.

In it he details a wide range of unusual phenomena. In the final chapter of the book he proposes a new cosmology that the earth is stationary in space and surrounded by a solid shell which is (in the book's final words) \".. not unthinkably far away.\"\n\nOf Fort's four books, this volume deals most frequently and scathingly with astronomy (continuing from his previous book \"New Lands\"). The book also deals extensively with other subjects, including paranormal phenomena (see parapsychology), which were explored in his first book, \"The Book of the Damned\". Fort is widely credited with having coined the now-popular term teleportation in this book, and here he ties his previous statements on what he referred to as the Super-Sargasso Sea into his beliefs on teleportation. He would later expand this theory to include purported mental and psychic phenomena in his fourth and final book, \"Wild Talents.\"\n\nIt takes its derisive title from what he regarded as the tendency of astronomers to make positivistic, overly precise, and premature announcements of celestial events and discoveries. Fort portrays them as quack prophets, sententiously pointing towards the skies and saying \"Lo!\"—inaccurately, as it turn out.\n\n\"Lo!\" is arguably Fort's most popular book, perhaps due to the fact that it deals with an extremely wide and diverse range of phenomena (as can be seen below), and Fort by then had a clear theorem. His book is divided into two sections: the first on the above phenomena; the second, on his attacks on astronomy. The reason for this is that Fort had been working on a follow-up to \"The Book of the Damned\", but he scrapped the idea and incorporated many of the subjects into this one.\n\nLo! is used extensively in Blue Balliett's book, \"Chasing Vermeer\".\n\nFort established his thesis for this particular book early on—that some sort of mysterious force, known as the \"cosmic joker\" (in his words), is responsible for the teleportation of people, animals, and materials. This thesis would be revised later to accommodate Fort's research on psychic phenomena in \"Wild Talents\".\n\nFort started the book largely where he left off in \"The Book of the Damned\": mysterious falls of animals and strange materials, flying stones, poltergeist activity, etc., and incorporated these strange phenomena into his new theory on teleportation, saying that teleportation from the Super-Sargasso Sea can explain these phenomena. Fort also briefly touched on UFOs again in this book, and wrote extensively on a number of other topics which he felt can be explained by teleportation: cryptozoology (including the Jersey Devil and various out of place animals), animal mutilations and attacks on people, strange swarming of balls, the appearance of various strange people from nowhere (the famous cases of Princess Caraboo and Kaspar Hauser), and the mysterious disappearances of others (including the diplomat Benjamin Bathurst, and vessels such as the \"Mary Celeste\", \"Carroll A. Deering\", and \"USS Cyclops\", presaging later interest in the Bermuda Triangle phenomenon). He wrote an extensive chapter on the winter of 1904-5 in Britain, when a widespread religious revival in England and Wales coincided with numerous other strange occurrences: the appearances of ghosts, poltergeists, a few purported cases of Spontaneous Human Combustion, and a ravenous wolf (or perhaps werewolf) mutilating sheep and other farm animals in Northumberland.\n\nFort believed that all of these anomalous phenomena can be explained by his teleportation theory—though he later apparently retracted this theory to an extent in his final book.\n\nAstronomy was in vogue since the discovery of the Planet Pluto, in part by calculation.\n\nFort was sceptical of Albert Einstein's theories of relativity and the claim that these could be confirmed by a transit of the Sun. He was sceptical of the accuracy of the mathematics and the observations involved, and pointed out seeming contradictions and anomalies in scientists' statements to the press.\n\nThe book was recently released in a paperback version, and it is included in \"The Complete Works Of Charles Fort\" with Fort's other paranormal writings.

John Wallis invokes the name as the title to a textbook on Cartesian geometry. For Leibniz, it would be supported by a calculus ratiocinator.\n\nDescartes' clearest description of the \"mathesis universalis\" occurs in Rule IV of the Rules for the Direction of the Mind, written before 1628. The desire for a language more perfect than any natural language had been expressed before Leibniz by John Wilkins in his \"An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language\" in 1668. Leibniz attempts to work out the possible connections between algebra, infinitesimal calculus, and universal character in an incomplete treatise titled \"Mathesis Universalis\" in 1695.\n\nPredicate logic could be seen as a modern system with some of these \"universal\" characteristics, at least as far as mathematics and computer science are concerned. More generally, \"mathesis universalis\", along with perhaps François Viète's algebra, represents one of the earliest attempts to construct a formal system.\n\nOne of the perhaps most prominent critics of the idea of \"mathesis universalis\" was Ludwig Wittgenstein and his philosophy of mathematics. As Anthropologist Prof. Emily Martin notes: 'Tackling mathematics, the realm of symbolic life perhaps most difficult to regard as contingent on social norms, Wittgenstein commented that people found the idea that numbers rested on conventional social understandings \"unbearable\"'\n\n\n"}
{"id": "270468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=270468", "title": "Media ecology", "text": "Media ecology\n\nMedia ecology theory is the study of media, technology, and communication and how they affect human environments. The theoretical concepts were proposed by Marshall McLuhan in 1964, while the term \"media ecology\" was first formally introduced by Neil Postman in 1968. \n\nEcology in this context refers to the environment in which the medium is used – what they are and how they affect society. Neil Postman states, \"if in biology a 'medium' is something in which a bacterial culture grows (as in a Petri dish), in media ecology, the medium is 'a technology within which a [human] culture grows.'\" In other words, \"Media ecology looks into the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival. The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving.\" \n\nMedia ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and communication technology is the primary cause of social change. McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, \"the medium is the message\", which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself. McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period.\n\nAdditionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of \"traffic\" between the two.\n\nIn 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at Cambridge University, a school which pioneered modern literary criticism. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, I.A. Richards, a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan's later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards' approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication. Richards believed that \"words won't stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous\". This element of Richards' perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as \"The Global Village\" and \"The Medium Is the Message\" two of his most well known phrases that encapsulate the theory of Media Ecology. \n\nMcLuhan used the approaches of Richards, William Empson, and Harlold Innis as an \"entrée to the study of media\". However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that \"if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their 'content' but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV\". This led to the emergence of his ideas on Media Ecology.\n\nIn addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day. He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie \"Annie Hall\".\n\nFew theories receive the kind of household recognition that Media Ecology received, due directly to McLuhan's role as a pop culture icon. He was an excellent debater and public speaker, but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia.\n\nInspired by McLuhan, Neil Postman founded the Program in Media Ecology at New York University in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers. \"Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments - like language itself, symbolic environments with in which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways.\"\n\nPostman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. \"I don't see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context.\" Postman's media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain?\n\nWalter Ong was a scholar with a master’s degree in English who was once a student of McLuhan at the Saint Louis University. The contributions of Ong standardized and gave creditability to the field of Media Ecology as an academic study that’s worth scholarship.\n\nThe studies of Ong have contributed greatly towards developing the concept of Media Ecology. Ong has written over 450 publications, many of which focused on the relation between conscious behavior and the evolution of the media, and he received the Media Ecology Association's Walter Benjamin Award for Outstanding Article for his paper, \"Digitization Ancient and Modern: Beginnings of Writing and Today's Computers\". \n\nMedia ecology is a contested term within media studies for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an interdisciplinary field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments. The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems. In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by Yuri Rozhdestvensky. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education. He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture.\n\nThe European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used \"because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter\". Following theorists such as Felix Guattari, Gregory Bateson, and Manuel De Landa, the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as Matthew Fuller and Jussi Parikka) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems.\n\nAlong with McLuhan , Postman and Harold Innis, media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of Walter Ong, Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, Félix Guattari, Eric Havelock, Susanne Langer, Erving Goffman, Edward T. Hall, George Herbert Mead, Margaret Mead, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Benjamin Lee Whorf, and Gregory Bateson.\n\n\nThese three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community.\n\nMcLuhan believed there are three inventions that transformed the world: the phonetic alphabet, the printing press, and the telegraph. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan split history into four periods: the tribal age, the literary age, the print age, and the electronic age (information age). Throughout the structure of their distinctive methods of communication (e.g., oral, written, printed, electronic), different media arouse patterns in the brain that are distinctive to each and every particular form of communication.\n\nThe first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age, a time of community because the ear is the dominant sense organ. This is also known as an acoustic era because the senses of hearing, touch, taste, and smell were far more strongly developed than the ability to visualize. During this time, hearing was more valuable because it allowed people to be more immediately aware of their surroundings, which was extremely important for hunting. Everyone hears at the same time making listening to someone in a group a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this world of surround sound, everything is more immediate, more present, and fosters more passion and spontaneity. During the Tribal Age, hearing was believing.\n\nThe second age is the Literacy Stage, a time of private detachment because the eye is the dominant sense organ; also known as the visual era. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to read over and over again. Hearing no longer becomes trustworthy; seeing was believing. Even though people read the same words, the act of reading is an individual act of singular focus. Tribes didn't need to come together to get information anymore. This is when the invention of the alphabet came about. During this time, when people learned to read, they became independent thinkers.\n\nThe third stage is the Print Age, when individual products were mass produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book. It allowed people to carry books, so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from immediacy of their surroundings.\n\nLastly, the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the information age, is an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returned us to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. Being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone's business and everyone's business is everyone else's. This phenomenon is called the global village.\n\nRobert K. Logan is professor emeritus of physics at the University of Toronto and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the Ontario College of Art and Design. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras:\nIn addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a \"participatory culture.\" Tom Valcanis argues that this very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple's iPhone. \"If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and 'mash-up' culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a 'participatory culture'...\"\n\n\"The medium is the message\" is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society.\n\nFor example, traditional media is an extension of the human body, while the new media is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society. The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That's why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation.\n\nWe are accustomed to thinking the message is separate from a medium. McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlook the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. \"It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive. The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us.\n\nDifferent mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses. Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed. With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.\n\nThe key elements to Media Ecology has been largely attributed to Marshal McLuhan, who coined the statement “the medium is the message.” Levinson furthers McLuhan’s statement by stating that “the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society” McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to Media Ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman \n\nThe very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring. As Carlos Scolari states, “the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period. There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase “the medium is the message”. Author Niall Stephan argues that while most attribute the  metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of “media ecology”.\n\nScholar Janet Sternberg has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese “yin/ yang” metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions can be distinguished in the field: the “yang” tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on intrapersonal communication and the “yin” tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.\n\nWhile general systems theory originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of Ludwig von Bertalanffy. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as \"one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components\".\n\nLogan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology \"cross pollinate each other\" in that, \"a general system is a medium\" due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are \"quasi-deterministic\".\n\nThis thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, \"A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them.\"\n\nMarshall McLuhan used the phrase global village to describe that \"humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous electronic media\". McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book \"The Gutenberg Galaxy\" saying, \"Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence\".\n\nTechnology, especially electronic media in today's age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries.\n\nThis seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan's day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today's society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight.\n\nOf note is McLuhan's insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one's own community. Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of 'Spaceship Earth' where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural; however, the original person to coin the term 'Spaceship Earth' was futurists R. Buckminster Fuller who once said, \"I've often heard people say: 'I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,' and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That's all we have experienced. We're all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth.\"\n\nCritics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices.\n\nThe idea of the global village helps to conceptualize globalization within society. Michael Plugh writes, \"[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment.\"\n\nAdditionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, \"Where literate societies exchange an 'eye for an ear,' according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or 'global' level.\"\n\nMcLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media. Hot media refer to a high-definition communication that demand little involvement from the audience and concentrate on one sensory organ at a time. These types of media require no interpretation because they give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. Cool media describe media that demand active involvement from the audience. Cool media require the audience to be active and fill in information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.\n\n\"McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear.\"\n\nAnother aspect of media ecology is the \"laws of media,\" which McLuhan outlined with his son Eric McLuhan to further explain the influence of technology on society. The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples' critical thinking skills and to prepare people for \"the social and physical chaos\" that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology.\n\nThe four effects, as depicted in the tetrad of media effects are:\n\nA significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. Determinism insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language (linguistic determinism), religion (theological determinism), financial (economic determinism). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man's technological achievements they can be classified as technological determinism. According to Postman, \"The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information.\" Postman has also stated that \"a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture's politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking\".\n\nScholars such as Michael Zimmer view McLuhan and his \"Medium is the Message\" theory as a prime example of technological determinism:\n\n...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by McLuhan's (1964/1994) assertion \nthat \"the medium is the message\", the technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism of the embodied theory of technological bias. \n\nThe critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world \"by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio-cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important.\"\n\nLance Strate, on the other hand, argues that McLuhan's theories are in no way deterministic. \"McLuhan never actually used the term, \"determinism,\" nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, \"The Medium is the Message\", he wrote, \"there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening\" (McLuhan & Fiore, 1967, p. 25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan's position with the quote, \"we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us\", suggesting a transactional approach to media.\" This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as \"soft determinism\" opposed to \"hard determinism\" with the difference being that \"hard determinism\" indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas \"soft determinism\" would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome.\n\nWhile ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Paul-Peter Verbeek argued that technologies are \"inherently moral agents\" and their development is a \"moral enterprise\".\n\nWhile advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology. \n\nOne example where this can be seen is in do-it-yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it-yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include \"any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media\". Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.\n\nVarious scholars have looked to media ecology theory through different lenses to better understand this theory in the 21 century. While Sternberg applied the yin/yang metaphor to make sense of the theory, Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick et. al create a new languages of modality. As such, contributing to a new rhetoric to contextualize Media Ecology in the age of the internet, social media, and advances in technologies. Hildebrand uses the conceptualization of ‘mediated mobilities’ to illustrate a connection between media ecology and mobilities research, ultimately making a case for a \"modal medium theory\". She looks into the articles of Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, and Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states Media Ecology Theory is “grammar and rhetoric, semiotics and systems theory, the history and the philosophy of technology”. Hildebrand explains that Strate’s concept of media ecology is not limited to the study of information and communication technology but technology, in general. Technology is therefore implying materialities and mobilities that is put into relation with media ecology. As Hildebrand states, “[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate”. Much like Media Ecology, mobilities research talk about a “flow” that shapes the environment, creating a contact zones. Dimmick furthers this statement by creating a term that describes the intersection of communication environments (“contact zones”) and issues of mobility- \"interstices.\" He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of “nonspace” or “nonplace” considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places.\n\nMcLuhan's critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really \"the medium is the message\" is a metaphor not an equation. His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an \"extension of man\" and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments.\n\nOne of McLuhan's high profile critics was Umberto Eco. Eco comes from background in semiotics, which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan's assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual's interpretation can vary. Believing this to be true Eco says, \"It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it.\" In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan's assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language.\n\nThe North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete and Neil Compton as meaningless or \"McLuhanacy\". According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, \"it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions.\" Theorists such as Jonathan Miller claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan's willingness to back away from a \"probe\" if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily. These theorists against McLuhan's idea, such as Raymond Rosenthal, also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims: \"McLuhan's books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology.\" Additionally, As Lance Strate said: \"Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a \"Great Divide\" theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics.\n\nMany ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current new media has a \"new\" stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of web 2.0. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, Tim O'Reilly. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about 'the widespread sense that there's something qualitatively different about today's Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and 'mash ups'. The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a participatory culture which proves Neil Postman's saying \" is not additive; it is ecological\".\n\nAs new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which \"portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation\". Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers. So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons.\n\nThere is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and media literacy in its youth. As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television. The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media.\n\nAccording to the media ecology theory, analyzing today's generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today's new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is \"the world's first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible.\" Second, \"there may actually be no unified ethos\". With \"hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces\".\n\nIn 2009 a study was published by Cleora D'Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled \"How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs\". The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested \"new media\" such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing \"hot\" and \"cold\" media at today's standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most \"valued\" method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning.\n\nThere is significant research being done on the rise of social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their influence on communication in society. Some of that research is being done through a media ecology perspective. Below are some examples: \n\nWhile many people utilize social media platforms to stay in contact with friends and family, socialize, or even shop, these platforms have also been pivotal for social activism. Social media activism and hashtag activism have become popular ways to gain mainstream media and public attention for causes, and to facilitate protests.\n\nThomas Poell researched the influence of social media on the 2010 protests of the Toronto G20 Summit. In the article, he focused on identifying how each social media site was used independently, and then how they were integrated together. The sites analyzed were Twitter, YouTube, Flikr, Facebook, and an open publishing website. What he found is that each site is used differently for social media activism. While this kind of activism was originally looked at as a way to promote causes and encourage long term focus on the issues, Poell found that sites like Twitter and Facebook tend to do the opposite. Posts center around photographs and videos of action during protests and rallies, not on the issues that are being protested. This would be an example of hot media, because the user can scroll through photos or watch videos without being otherwise engaged, instead of cool media where the user has to be more involved. Additionally, because activists are using sites they do not own, the social media platform actually has more control over the information being posted. For example, Twitter no longer allows unrestricted access to all posts made with a certain hashtag after a period of time. This seems to mean that the issue being highlighted fades over time.\n\nAdditionally, Heather Crandall and Carolyn M. Cunningham focus on hashtag activism, where activists use metadata tags to focus on specific issues (ex: #activism). They did not look at one specific protest like the G20 summit, but rather at the benefits and criticisms of hashtag activism as a whole. They discuss that social media is a new media ecology, one where users can connect and share ideas without boundaries. This falls under McLuhan's idea of the world as a global village. By using hashtags, activists are able to bring awareness to social issues. Crandall and Cunningham point out that this is both beautiful and interesting, because it encourages learning, conversations, and community for social justice, and that it is also dark and confusing, because the open environment of the internet also allows hashtags to be used for hate speech and threats of violence. Also, they posit that hashtag activism is pointed and stacked, in that hashtags are often short lived, and the user has to be able to navigate the platform and understand hashtags in order to gain knowledge of the issue. When viewed through media ecology, hashtag activism is changing the way people encounter and engage in social justice.\n\nDoctor Mark Allen Peterson of in the Department of Anthropology at Miami University published an article in the Summer of 2011 comparing the media ecology of 1970's Iran to that in Egypt in 2011. The article, title \"Egypt's Media Ecology in a Time of Revolution\" looks at the difference that social media made in the Egyptian uprising and makes two observations: social media extends the \"grapevine\" network and that social media, despite the result of the uprising, completely changes the \"mediascape\" of Egypt. One dramatic difference between the two uprising noticed by Peterson is the ultimate position of the media of choice during each in the end. On the one hand, Iran's news media, the primary source of information at that time, reverted to its original role, while the Egyptian use of social media changed the media of choice for Egypt.\n\nPeterson's study compared his observations to that of William Beeman, who in 1984 published an essay, \"The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after\" on the media ecology of Iran. Beeman's ultimate conclusion of his review of the Iranian Revolution followed that of what you would expect to find from most media ecologists: \"At times newly introduced mass media have produced revolutionary effects in the societal management of time and energy as they forged new spaces for themselves. Thus media are cultural forces as well as cultural objects. In operation, they produce specific cultural effects that cannot be easily predicted.\"\n\nAlthough there were many similarities between the Iranian and Egyptian revolutions, such as censorship in media, including newspaper and television, the one major difference was the availability of the internet and social media as a tool to spread messages and increase awareness in Egypt. Social media in 2011's uprising was equivalent to the use of cassette tapes in Iran in the 1970s. The tapes provided a way to spread information that could not be as easily censored and was repeatable through the country. The rise of social media helped free Egyptians from censorship of other media. In this case, the medium was the message, a message of freedom and by the Egyptian government's attempt to also censor this medium, they only managed to spread the message further and faster:\n\nAlthough we may never know the true impact, in fact it likely sped up the regime's fall. In the absence of new technologies, people were forced to rely on traditional means of communication, including knocking on doors, going to the mosque, assembling in the street, or other central gathering places. Thomas Schelling won a Nobel prize in part for discovering that in the absence of information, people will coordinate by selecting a focal point that seems natural, special or relevant to them. Given the protests, Tahrir Square was the obvious focal point. By blocking the Internet, the government inadvertently fueled dissent and galvanized international support for the people of Egypt. (Bowman 2011)\n\nSince 2011, leaders of the protest continue to utilize social media as a method to push democratic reform. According to Peterson the role of social media in Egypt is also evolving the political culture as even state figures are beginning to make announcements using social media rather than more traditional forms of media.\n\nMuch like the Arab Spring, the Gezi protests were an environmental sit-in that ultimately turned into a social movement based on the influence of various forms of social media. Rolien Hoyng and Murat Es coin the term “Turkish media ecology” to evoke a sense of particularly on the part of Turkey’s relationship with media outlets and platforms. In Turkey, media censorship and control by state institutions most directly impact broadcast media. Both authors emphasize how “…media-ecological affordances are conditioned and modulated by legal frameworks and institutional-political rationalities”. They also note that such censored media ecology forms a ‘fertile milieu’ for the proliferation of conspiracy theories which both feed on one another. Scholar Gulizar Haciyakupoglu examines how social media influenced the protests, specifically looking at how trust was built and maintained among protestors across multiple platforms. From his interviews, the scholar extrapolates that “closed groups” like Whatsapp and Facebook “…allowed the circulation of confidential and trustworthy information among first- and second-degree friends” whereas Twitter was used for “rapid acquisition of logistic information” that became important during the protest. \n\nEmiliano Treré looks to the Media Ecology metaphor as a way to investigate the relationship between social movements, media ecologies and communication technologies through the lens of Spain’s 15M movement. Treré states how most scholars believe the media ecological framework is particularly suited for the study of the social movements/media nexus “…because of its ability to provide fine-tuned explorations of the multiplicity, the interconnections, the dynamic evolution of old and new media forms for social change”. The author also agrees with Scolari (mentioned above) that the key reflections from the theory is especially beneficial for modern analysis on media and social events. One such application is seen with the analysis of Spain’s anti-austerity movement, also called the “15M movement.” Facing different degrees of mainstream media manipulation and bias “various media activists turned to Web TV services, radical online tools, Twitter and Facebook among others to organize, and contrast the official narratives of the protest.\" Scholar John Postill argues that Twitter, among all the types of technologies used, produced a greater effect for setting and tone and agenda of the movement. Such appropriation of technologies demonstrates the dichotomies between old and new technologies that in term created a kind of “technological sovereignty” among activists. Media Ecology has the innate ability to aggregate different analytical approaches to better understand the technology that is at place during such a protest. Postill and other scholars ultimately look to a new age in social activism, where “viral” posts shared by media professionals and amateurs empower people and become the rising voice for the future of democracy in Spain.\n\n\n\n"}

Middens with damp, anaerobic conditions can even preserve organic remains in deposits as the debris of daily life are tossed on the pile. Each individual toss will contribute a different mix of materials depending upon the activity associated with that particular toss. During the course of deposition sedimentary material is deposited as well. Different mechanisms, from wind and water to animal digs, create a matrix which can also be analyzed to provide seasonal and climatic information. In some middens individual dumps of material can be discerned and analysed.\n\nA shell midden or shell mound is an archaeological feature consisting mainly of mollusk shells. The Danish term \"køkkenmøddinger\" (plural) was first used by Japetus Steenstrup to describe shell heaps and continues to be used by some researchers. A midden, by definition, contains the debris of human activity, and should not be confused with wind or tide created beach mounds. Some shell middens are processing remains: areas where aquatic resources were processed directly after harvest and prior to use or storage in a distant location.\n\nSome shell middens are directly associated with villages, as a designated village dump site. In other middens, the material is directly associated with a house in the village. Each household would dump its garbage directly outside the house. In all cases, shell middens are extremely complex and very difficult to excavate fully and exactly. The fact that they contain a detailed record of what food was eaten or processed and many fragments of stone tools and household goods makes them invaluable objects of archaeological study.\n\nShells have a high calcium carbonate content, which tends to make the middens alkaline. This slows the normal rate of decay caused by soil acidity, leaving a relatively high proportion of organic material (food remnants, organic tools, clothing, human remains) available for archaeologists to find.\n\nEdward Sylvester Morse conducted one of the first archaeological excavations of shellmounds in Omori, Japan in 1877, which led to the discovery of a style of pottery described as \"cord-marked\", translated as \"Jōmon\", which came to be used to refer to the early period of Japanese history when this style of pottery was produced. Shell middens were studied in Denmark in the latter half of the 19th century. The Danish word \"køkkenmødding\" (kitchen mound) is now used internationally. The English word \"midden\" (waste mound) derives from the same Old Norse word that produced the modern Danish one.\n\nShell middens are found in coastal zones all over the world. Consisting mostly of mollusc shells, they are interpreted as being the waste products of meals eaten by nomadic groups or hunting parties. Some are small examples relating to meals had by a handful of individuals, others are many metres in length and width and represent centuries of shell deposition. In Brazil, they are known as \"sambaquis\", having been created over a long period between the 6th millennium BC and the beginning of European colonisation.\n\nOn Canada's west coast, there are shell middens that run for more than a kilometer along the coast and are several meters deep. The midden in Namu, British Columbia is over 9 meters deep and spans over 10,000 years of continuous occupation.\n\nShell middens created in coastal regions of Australia by indigenous Australians exist in Australia today. Middens provide evidence of prior occupation and are generally protected from mining and other developments. One must exercise caution in deciding whether one is examining a midden or a beach mound. There are good examples on the Freycinet Peninsula in Tasmania where wave action currently is combining charcoal from forest fire debris with a mix of shells into masses that storms deposit above high-water mark. Shell mounds near Weipa in far north Queensland that are mostly less than 2 meters high (although ranging up to 10 meters high) and a few tens of meters long are claimed to be middens, but are in fact shell cheniers (beach ridges) re-worked by nest mound-building birds.\n\nShell mounds are also attributed to the creation of tropical hardwood hammocks, one example being the Otter mound preserve in Florida, where shell deposits from Calusa natives provided flood free high areas in otherwise large watered areas.\n\nThere are instances in which shell middens may have doubled as areas of ceremonial construction or ritual significance. The Woodland period Crystal River site provides an example of this phenomenon.\n\nSome shell mounds, known as shell rings, are circular or open arcs with a clear central area. Many are known from Japan and the southeastern United States, and at least one from South America.\n\nThe word is of Scandinavian via Middle English derivation; from early Scandinavian; Danish: mødding, Swedish regional: mödding), and is today used by archaeologists worldwide to describe any kind of feature containing waste products relating to day-to-day human life. They may be convenient, single-use pits created by nomadic groups or long-term, designated dumps used by sedentary communities that accumulate over several generations.\n\nThe word \"midden\" is still in everyday use in Scotland and Northern England, and has come by extension to refer to anything that is a mess, including people and pets. This use was also taken to Northern Ireland by Scottish plantation settlers. Privy middens were common in Manchester. In West Yorkshire, a midden is also an outside lavatory, typically in the back yards of terraced houses. Often attached to this small building is an outhouse which houses dustbins.\n\nThe word is used by farmers in Britain to describe the place where farm yard manure from cows or other animals is collected. Grants are sometimes available to protect these from rain to avoid runoff and pollution.\n\nIn the animal kingdom, some species establish ground burrows, also known as middens, that are used mostly for food storage. For example, the North American red squirrel (\"Tamiasciurus hudsonicus\") usually has one large active midden in each territory with perhaps an inactive or auxiliary midden. A midden may be a regularly used animal toilet area or dunghill, created by many mammals, such as the hyrax, and also serving as a territorial marker.\n\nSome animals, including some species of fishes, collect foodstuffs with heavy shells that are hard to remove. They may establish sites where rocks or similar items are available as natural anvils on which the animals habitually break open the shells. These discarded shells may accumulate around the anvils in sizable middens, sometimes for generations. Commonly such middens are sited where there is a convenient rock that is an unusual resource in the region.\n\nOctopus middens are piles of debris that the octopus piles up to conceal the entrance of its den. Octopus middens are commonly made of rocks, shells, and the bones of prey, although they may contain anything the octopus finds that it can move.\n\nSome more currently widespread used terms include garbage pile, garbage dump, waste pile, waste dump, and waste/garbage disposal site. The material (waste, garbage, refuse, rubbish, etc.) may be placed on a pile/mound on level ground or in a hole/pit dug into the ground which may be subsequently covered over with other material, often for sanitary, aesthetic or land reclamation reasons.\n\n"}
{"id": "18119603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18119603", "title": "Midland American English", "text": "Midland American English\n\nMidland American English is a regional dialect or super-dialect of American English, geographically lying between the traditionally-defined Northern and Southern United States. The boundaries of Midland American English are not entirely clear, being revised and reduced by linguists due to definitional changes and several Midland sub-regions undergoing rapid and diverging pronunciation shifts since the early-middle twentieth century onwards.\n\nThese general characteristics of the Midland regional accent are firmly established: fronting of the , , and vowels occurs towards the center or even front of the mouth; the cot–caught merger is neither fully completed nor fully absent; and short-\"a\" tensing evidently occurs strongest before nasal consonants. The currently-documented core of the Midland dialect region spans from central Ohio at its eastern extreme to central Nebraska and Oklahoma City at its western extreme. Certain areas outside of this core also clearly demonstrate a Midland accent, including Charleston, South Carolina; the Texan cities of Abilene, Austin, and Corpus Christi; and central and southern Florida. \n\nTwentieth-century dialectology was the first to identify the \"Midland\" as a region lexically distinct from the Northern and Southern U.S., later even focusing on an internal division (North Midland versus South Midland); however, twenty-first-century studies now reveal increasing unification of the South Midland with a larger, newer Southern accent region, while much of the North Midland retains a more \"General American\" accent. Early twentieth-century boundaries established for the Midland dialect region are being reduced or revised, since several previous sub-regions of Midland speech have since developed their own distinct dialects. Pennsylvania, the original home state of the Midland dialect, is one such area, having now formed such unique dialects as Philadelphia and Pittsburgh English.\n\nThe dialect region \"Midland\" was first defined by Hans Kurath as centered on central Pennsylvania and expanding westward and southward to include most of Pennsylvania, and the Appalachian regions of Kentucky, Tennessee, and all of West Virginia. A decade later, Kurath split this into two discrete subdivisions: the \"North Midland\" beginning north of the Ohio River valley area and extending westward into Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and northern Missouri, as well as parts of Nebraska and northern Kansas ; and the \"South Midland\", which extends south of the Ohio River and expands westward to include Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, southern Missouri, Arkansas, southern Kansas, and Oklahoma, west of the Mississippi river. While Craig Carver and the related \"Dictionary of American Regional English\" based their 1960s research only on lexical (vocabulary) characteristics, William Labov and his team conversely based their 1990s research largely on phonological (sound) characteristics and defined the Midland area as a buffer zone between the Inland North and the South accent regions. In Labov et al.'s newer study, the \"Midland\" essentially coincides with Kurath's \"North Midland\", the \"South Midland\" being now considered as largely a portion, or the northern fringe, of the Southern dialect region. Indeed, while the lexical and grammatical isoglosses encompass the Appalachian Mountains regardless of the Ohio River, the phonological boundary fairly closely follows along the Ohio River itself.\n\nThe original Midland dialect region, thus, has split off into having more of a Southern accent in southern Appalachia, while, the second half of the twentieth century has seen the emergence of a unique Western Pennsylvania accent in northern Appalachia (centered on Pittsburgh) as well as a unique Philadelphia accent.\n\nThe dialect region of the Mid-Atlantic States—centered on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; and Wilmington, Delaware—falls under the Midland, except that it strongly resists the cot–caught merger and traditionally has a short-\"a\" split that is similar to New York City's, though still unique. Certain vocabulary is also specific to the Mid-Atlantic dialect, and particularly to its Philadelphia sub-dialect.\n\nThe emerging and expanding dialect of western and much of central Pennsylvania is, for many purposes, an extension of the South Midland; it is spoken also in Youngstown, Ohio, ten miles west of the state line, as well as Clarksburg, West Virginia. Like the Midland proper, the Western Pennsylvania accent features fronting of and , as well as positive \"anymore\". Its chief distinguishing features, however, also make it a separate dialect than the Midland one. These features include a completed – merger to a rounded vowel, which also causes a chain shift that drags the vowel into the previous position of . The Western Pennsylvania accent, lightheartedly known as \"Pittsburghese\", is perhaps best known for the monophthongization of to ( to ), such as the stereotypical Pittsburgh pronunciation of \"downtown\" as \"dahntahn\". Despite having a Northern accent in the first half of the 20th century, Erie, Pennsylvania, is the only major Northern city to change its affiliation to Midland by now using the Western Pennsylvania accent.\n\n\n\nToday, the South Midland is an area with more Midland vocabulary and grammar but more Southern phonology. However, the South Midland employs some Southern vocabulary too, for example, favoring \"y'all\" as the plural of \"you\", whereas the North Midland favors \"you guys\".\n\nToday, the city of Charleston, South Carolina, clearly has all the defining features of a mainstream Midland accent. The vowels and are extremely fronted, and yet not so not before . Also, the older, more traditional Charleston accent was extremely \"non-Southern\" in sound (as well as being highly unique), spoken throughout the South Carolina and Georgia Lowcountry, but it mostly faded out of existence in the first half of twentieth century.\n\nOlder English speakers of Cincinnati, Ohio, have a phonological pattern quite distinct from the surrounding area (Boberg and Strassel 2000), while younger speakers now align to the general Midland accent. The older Cincinnati short-\"a\" system is unique in the Midland. While there is no evidence for a phonemic split, the phonetic conditioning of short-\"a\" in conservative Cincinnati speech is similar to and originates from that of New York City, with the raising environments including nasals (m, n, ŋ), voiceless fricatives (f, unvoiced th, sh, s), and voiced stops (b, d, g). Weaker forms of this pattern are shown by speakers from nearby Dayton and Springfield. Boberg and Strassel (2000) reported that Cincinnati's traditional short-\"a\" system was giving way among younger speakers to a nasal system similar to those found elsewhere in the Midland and the West.\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri, is historically one among several (North) Midland cities, but it has developed some unique features of its own distinguishing it from the rest of the Midland. The area around St. Louis has been in dialectal transition throughout most of the 1900s until the present moment. The eldest generation of the area may exhibit a rapidly-declining merger of the phonemes (as in \"for\") and (as in \"far\") to the sound , while leaving distinct (as in \"four\"), thus being one of the few American accents to still resist the horse-hoarse merger (while also displaying the card-cord merger). This merger has led to jokes referring to \"I farty-far\", although a more accurate eye spelling would be \"I farty-four\". Also, some St. Louis speakers, again usually the oldest ones, have instead of more typical before —thus \"measure\" is pronounced —and \"wash\" (as well as \"Washington\") gains an , becoming (\"warsh\"). \n\nSince the mid-1900s (namely, in speakers born from the 1920s to 1940s), however, a newer accent arose in a dialect \"corridor\" essentially following historic U.S. Route 66 in Illinois (now Interstate 55 in Illinois) from Chicago southwest to St. Louis. Speakers of this modern \"St. Louis Corridor\"—including St. Louis, Fairbury, and Springfield, Illinois—have gradually developed more features of the Inland North dialect, best recognized today as the Chicago accent. This twentieth-century St. Louis accent's separating quality from the rest of the Midland is its strong resistance to the \"cot–caught\" merger and the most advanced development of the Northern Cities Vowel Shift (NCS). In the twentieth century, Greater St. Louis therefore became a mix of Midland accents and Inland Northern (Chicago-like) accents.\n\nEven more complicated, however, there is evidence that these Northern sound changes are reversing for the younger generations of speakers in the St. Louis area, who are re-embracing purely Midland-like accent features, though only at a regional level and therefore not including the aforementioned traditional features of the eldest generation. According to a UPenn study, the St. Louis Corridor's one-generation period of embracing the NCS was followed by the next generation's \"retreat of NCS features from Route 66 and a slight increase of NCS off of Route 66\", in turn followed by the most recent generations' decreasing evidence of the NCS until it disappears altogether among the youngest speakers. Thus, due to harboring two different dialects in the same geographic space, the \"Corridor appears simultaneously as a single dialect area and two separate dialect areas\".\n\nRather than a proper Southern accent, several cities in Texas can be better described as having a Midland accent, as they lack the \"true\" Southern accent's full deletion and the oft-accompanying Southern Vowel Shift. Texan cities classifiable as such specifically include Abilene, Austin, and Corpus Christi. Austin, in particular, has been reported in some speakers to show the South Midland (but not the Southern) variant of deletion mentioned above.\n\n"}
{"id": "404656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404656", "title": "Mythologies (book)", "text": "Mythologies (book)\n\nMythologies is a 1957 book by Roland Barthes. It is a collection of essays taken from \"Les Lettres nouvelles\", examining the tendency of contemporary social value systems to create modern myths. Barthes also looks at the semiology of the process of myth creation, updating Ferdinand de Saussure's system of sign analysis by adding a second level where signs are elevated to the level of myth.\n\n\"Mythologies\" is split into two: Mythologies and Myth Today, the first section consisting of a collection of essays on selected modern myths and the second further and general analysis of the concept.\n\nThe first section of \"Mythologies\" describes a selection of modern cultural phenomena, chosen for their status as modern myths and for the added meaning that has been conferred upon them. Each short chapter analyses one such myth, ranging from \"Einstein's Brain\" to \"Soap Powders and Detergents\". They were originally written as a series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine \"Les Lettres Nouvelles\".\n\nIn a typical example, Barthes describes the image that has been built up around red wine and how it has been adopted as a French national drink, how it is seen as a social equaliser and the drink of the proletariat, partly because it is seen as blood-like (as in Holy Communion) and points out that very little attention is paid to red wine's harmful effects to health, but that it is instead viewed as life-giving and refreshing — 'in cold weather, it is associated with all the myths of becoming warm, and at the height of summer, with all the images of shade, with all things cool and sparkling.'\n\nIn another chapter, Barthes explores the myth of professional wrestling. He describes how, unlike in the sport of boxing, the aim of theatrical stunt fighting is not to discover who will win or 'a demonstration of excellence', it is a staged spectacle acting out society's basic concepts of good and evil, of 'Suffering, Defeat and Justice'. The actors pretending to be wrestlers, like characters in a pantomime, portray grossly-exaggerated stereotypes of human weakness: the traitor, the conceited, the 'effeminate teddy-boy'. The audience expects to watch them suffer and be punished for their own transgressions of wrestling's rules in a theatrical version of society's ideology of justice.\n\nIn an interview Barthes once mentioned working on an essay on hidden tracks in recorded music. This essay, however, has never been published.\n\n\nIn the second half of the book Barthes addresses the question of \"What is a myth, today?\" with the analysis of ideas such as: myth as a type of speech, and myth on the wings of politics.\nFollowing on from the first section, Barthes justifies and explains his choices and analysis. He calls upon the concepts of semiology developed by Ferdinand de Saussure, who described the connections between an object (the signified) and its linguistic representation (such as a word, the signifier) and how the two are connected. Working with this structure Barthes continues to show his idea of a myth as a further sign, with its roots in language, but to which something has been added. So with a word (or other linguistic unit) the meaning (apprehended content) and the sound come together to make a sign. To make a myth, the sign itself is used as a \"signifier\", and a new meaning is added, which is the \"signified\". But according to Barthes, this is \"not\" added arbitrarily. Although we are not necessarily aware of it, modern myths are created with a reason. As in the example of the red wine, mythologies are formed to perpetuate an idea of society that adheres to the current ideologies of the ruling class and its media.\n\nBarthes demonstrates this theory with the example of a front cover from \"Paris Match\" edition no. 326, of July 1955, showing a young black soldier in French uniform saluting. The \"signifier\": a saluting soldier, cannot offer us further factual information of the young man's life. But it has been chosen by the magazine to symbolise more than the young man; the picture, in combination with the \"signifieds\" of Frenchness, militariness, and relative ethnic difference, gives us a message about France and its citizens. The picture does not explicitly demonstrate 'that France is a great empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under her flag,' etc., but the combination of the signifier and signified perpetuates the myth of imperial devotion, success and thus; a property of 'significance' for the picture.\n\nExploring the concept of myth, Barthes seeks to grasp the relations between language and power. He assumes that myth helps to naturalize particular worldviews.\n\nAccording to Barthes, myth is based on humans’ history, and myth cannot naturally occur. There are always some communicative intentions in myth. Created by people, myth can easily be changed or destroyed. Also, myth depends on the context where it exists. By changing the context, one can change the effects of myth. At the same time, myth itself participates in the creation of an ideology. According to Barthes, myth doesn’t seek to show or to hide the truth when creating an ideology, it seeks to deviate from the reality. The major function of myth is to naturalize a concept, a belief. Myth purifies signs and fills them with a new meaning which is relevant to the communicative intentions of those who are creating the myth. In the new sign, there are no contradictions that could raise any doubts regarding the myth. Myth is not deep enough to have these contradictions; it simplifies the world by making people believe that signs have inherent meaning. Myth “abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of essences…”\n\nWhy do people believe in myth? The power of myth is in its impressive character. It seeks to surprise the audience. This impression is way more powerful than any rational explanations which can disprove the myth. So, myth works not because it hides its intentions, but because the intentions of myth have been naturalized. Through the usage of myths, one can naturalize “the Empire, [the] taste for Basque things, the Government.”\n\nSpeaking of myth and power, Barthes asserts that myth is a depoliticized speech. He uses the term ex-nomination (or exnomination), by which he \"means 'outside of naming'. Barthes' point was that dominant groups or ideas in society become so obvious or common sense that they don't have to draw attention to themselves by giving themselves a name. They're just the 'normality', against which everything else can be judged.\" For example he says, \"[the bourgeoisie] makes its status undergo a real \"ex-nominating operation\": the bourgeoisie is defined as \"the social class which does not want to be named\"\" (italics in original). Myth removes our understanding of concepts and beliefs as created by humans. Instead, myth presents them as something natural and innocent. Drawing upon Karl Marx, Barthes states that even the most natural objects include some aspect of politics. Depending on how strong the political side of myth is, Barthes defines the strong and the weak myths (\"des mythes forts et des mythes faibles\"). Depoliticization of the strong myths happens abruptly, as the strong myths are explicitly political. The weak myths are the myths which have already lost their political character. However, this character can be brought back by “the slightest thing”. \nBarthes also provides a list of rhetorical figures in bourgeoisie myths:\n\nThe model of semiosis suggested by Barthes seeks to link signs with the social myths or ideologies that they articulate.\n\nIn writing about the mythologisation process, Barthes refers to the tendency of socially constructed notions, narratives, and assumptions to become \"naturalised\" in the process, that is, taken unquestioningly as given within a particular culture. Barthes finishes \"Mythologies\" by looking at how and why myths are built up by the bourgeoisie in its various manifestations. He returns to this theme in later works including \"The Fashion System\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "141264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=141264", "title": "Prismatic blade", "text": "Prismatic blade\n\nIn archaeology, a prismatic blade is a long, narrow, specialized stone flake tool with a sharp edge, like a small razor blade. Prismatic blades are flaked from stone cores through pressure flaking or direct percussion. This process results in a very standardized finished tool and waste assemblage. The most famous and most prevalent prismatic blade material is obsidian, as obsidian use was widespread in Mesoamerica, though chert, flint, and chalcedony blades are not uncommon. The term is generally restricted to Mesoamerican archeology, although some examples are found in the Old World, for example in a Minoan grave in Crete. \n\nPrismatic blades were used for cutting and scraping, and have been reshaped into other tool types, such as projectile points and awls.\n\nPrismatic blades are often trapezoidal in cross section, but very close in appearance to an isosceles trapezoid. Triangular blades (in cross-section) are also common. The ventral surface of the prismatic blade is very smooth, sometimes bearing slight rippling reflecting the direction of applied force and a very small bulb of applied force (indicative of pressure reduction). Flake scars are absent on the ventral surface of these blades, though eraillure flakes are sometimes present on the bulb . The dorsal surface, on the other hand, exhibits scar ridges running parallel to the long axis of the blade. These facets are created by the previous removal of blades from the core. The proximal end contains the blade's striking platform and its bulb of applied force, while the distal end will consist of a snap break, a feather termination, or a stepped termination.\n\nObsidian prismatic blade production was ubiquitous in Mesoamerica, and these tools can be found at a large majority of Mesoamerican archaeological sites from the Preclassic period on until the arrival of the Spanish in the early 16th century. Ethnohistoric sources recount the process of prismatic blade production. Fray Motolinia, a Spanish observer, recorded:\n\nThe production of prismatic blades creates not only a very standardized final product, but also a standardized waste assemblage. The analysis of obsidian debitage can reveal whether or not prismatic blade production occurred at a site and, if it had, what stages of production the process included. In other words, the types of manufacturing waste present (e.g., rejuvenation flakes and/or blades, platform rejuvenation flakes, etc.) at a site can inform archaeologists about the stage in which blades were being produced.\n\n"}
{"id": "25535894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25535894", "title": "Repatriation and reburial of human remains", "text": "Repatriation and reburial of human remains\n\nThe repatriation and reburial of human remains is a current debate in archaeology. Various indigenous peoples around the world, such as Native Americans and Indigenous Australians have requested that human remains from their respective communities be repatriated for reburial. A famous case is that of the Kennewick Man in the United States. Similarly, contemporary Druids have requested the reburial of ancient human remains in the British Isles.\n\nRepatriation in general seems to be concerned with objects, in the broadest sense of the word, ranging from human remains to art repatriation. But it actually is about people in the present and their perception of the past in the present. Repatriation claims are linked to politics, ethnic identity, and other debates or problems in contemporary society that have or claim to have a historical link to the object.\n\nThe controversy comes from the fact that some believe that it is disrespectful to the dead and to their contemporary descendants for their remains to be displayed in a museum or stored in other ways.\n\nThe first and foremost undercurrent of repatriation is the ill treatment of people in the past, the repatriation of human remains is to a degree part of a healing process bandaging the traumas of history. In essence it is important that this ill treatment is addressed but with the repatriation and reburial of remains they are essentially lost to the world as a reminder of that part of the object's history or biography. Repatriation also presents an opportunity for people to lay claim to their own past and actively decide what is and what is not a part of their cultural heritage. The basis beneath the open wounds of history is the difference in treatment of remains that were seen as sufficiently other and could therefore be studied without any ethical considerations.\n\nThe contesting of ownership of human remains in museums and other institutions, and demands of return to cultural groups is largely fuelled by the difference in the handling of ‘white’ and indigenous remains. Where the former were reburied the latter were subjects of study and eventually ending up in museums. In a sense one cultural group assumed the right to carry out scientific research upon another cultural group. This disrespectful unequal treatment stems from a time when race and cultural differences had huge social implications. These are changing but the aftermath of centuries of inequality cannot be corrected so easily. This frustration is what partly fuels the repatriation and ownership claims that seem to have increased in the last 30 years. The “traumas of history” can be addressed by reconciliation, repatriation and formal governmental apologies disapproving of conducts in the past by the institutions they now represent. A good example of a repatriation case is described by Thorton where a large group of massacred Indians is returned to their tribe, showing the healing power of the repatriation gesture.\n\nThe Neo-druidic movement is a modern religion, with some groups originating in the 18th century and others in the 20th century. They are generally inspired by either Victorian-era ideas of the druids of the Iron Age, or later neopagan movements. Some practice ancestor veneration, and because of this may believe that they have a responsibility to care for the ancient dead where they now live. In 2006 Paul Davies requested that the Alexander Keiller Museum in Avebury, Wiltshire rebury their Neolithic human remains, and that storing and displaying them was \"immoral and disrespectful\". The National Trust refused to allow reburial, but did allow for Neo-druids to perform a healing ritual in the museum.\n\nThe archaeological community has voiced criticism of the Neo-druids, making statements such as \"no single modern ethnic group or cult should be allowed to appropriate our ancestors for their own agendas. It is for the international scientific community to curate such remains.\" An argument proposed by archaeologists is that, \n\"Druids are not the only people who have feelings about human remains... We don't know much about the religious beliefs of these [Prehistoric] people, but know that they wanted to be remembered, their stories, mounds and monuments show this. Their families have long gone, taking all memory with them, and we archaeologists, by bringing them back into the world, are perhaps the nearest they have to kin. We care about them, spending our lives trying to turn their bones back into people... The more we know the better we can remember them. Reburying human remains destroys people and casts them into oblivion: this is at best, misguided, and at worse cruel.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "917000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=917000", "title": "Santer Commission", "text": "Santer Commission\n\nThe Santer Commission was the European Commission in office between 23 January 1995 and 15 March 1999. The administration was led by Jacques Santer (former Prime Minister of Luxembourg).\n\nThe body had 20 members and oversaw the introduction of the euro. It was cut short when the Commission became the first to resign \"en masse\" due to allegations of corruption. Some members continued under Manuel Marín until the Prodi Commission was appointed.\n\nIn 1994 Jacques Delors was due to step down from a successful tenure as President of the European Commission. However his federalist style was not to the liking of many national governments. Hence when the proposal of Jean-Luc Dehaene (the then-Prime Minister of Belgium) was presented, he was vetoed by the UK on the grounds he was too federalist. Jacques Santer, then-Prime Minister of Luxembourg, was seen as less federalist as his presidency had earlier proposed the pillar structure. Hence he was nominated and approved by the European Council on 15 July 1994.\n\nHence he was seen as being the \"second choice\" which weakened his position, with the European Parliament approving him only by a narrow majority. Santer himself admitted that he \"was not the first choice – but to become Commission president was not my first choice either.\" He did however flex his powers over the nominations for the other Commissioners. The President gained this power under the Maastricht Treaty that came into force the previous year. On 18 January 1995 he got his Commission approved by Parliament by 416 votes to 103 (a larger majority than expected) and they were appointed by the Council on 23 January.\n\nThe Santer Commission oversaw the development of the Treaty of Nice before it was signed in 2000, negotiations with those countries to join in 2004 and the signing of the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997.\n\nNotably it contributed to the development of the euro and issued a series of green papers based on Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy's work. The Commission also developed the euro currency symbol. The euro was established on 1999-01-01. The Commission also continued Delors' social agenda, pushed for more powers in that field including tackling unemployment and began proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.\n\nSanter, desiring a quotable slogan for his administration, stated his Commissions aim would be \"to do less, but do it better\" (a slogan adopted and adapted by many since). Although just a sound bite, it touched a chord for some thinking the Community needed a rest after the new treaties and the euro, even if the nature of the Community itself requires movements and new projects to keep it busy. However, during 1998 the Commission began to lose authority due to management criticisms from the Parliament.\n\nThe community's budget for each year needs to be discharged by the Parliament following its report by the European Court of Auditors. It had only refused to do so once previously, in 1984. Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control initially refused to discharge the community's budget for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement. Paul van Buitenen, a whistle-blower working in the Commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging that widespread fraud and cover ups, stating: \"I found strong indications that . . . auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations . . . The commission is a closed culture and they want to keep it that way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power where it belongs – and that's in the democratically-elected European Parliament.\" In response, the Commission suspended him on half pay for releasing details of an inquiry.\nHowever it eventually supported the discharge 14 to 13 on 11 December, recommending that the plenary support the discharge. It was taken to plenary for debate four days later however the assigned rapporteur publicly went against the Committee's official position and urged the plenary to reject the discharge motion. President Santer announced that the Commission would treat the vote of discharge as one of confidence. In a vote on 17 December 1998, the Parliament denied the discharge.\n\nIn response, on the basis it was tantamount to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, Pauline Green, announced she would put forward a motion of censure. However PES would vote against its own motion, as there is no method for a motion of confidence. During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a \"de facto\" opposition party to the executive. This is in part because the allegations centred on Édith Cresson and Manuel Marín, both from the Socialist party (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the People's party (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the 1999 elections. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations. Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main allegations are against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.\n\nFollowing negotiations, including national capitals pressuring their MEPs, the Parliament met to vote on the resolutions on 14 January 1999. It accepted the PES resolution and turned down a censure motion 293 to 232. Hence the \"Committee of Independent Experts\" was set up with its members appointed by the political leaders in Parliament and the Commission to create a balance. A number of high-profile figures were appointed and President Santer agreed to \"respond\" to its findings. The report was produced on 15 March 1999 and was presented to the Commission and Parliament. It largely cleared most members, aside from Cresson, but concluded that there was growing reluctance of the Commissioners to acknowledge responsibility and that \"It was becoming increasingly difficult to find anyone who had the slightest sense of responsibility.\"\nIn response to the report, PES withdrew their support from the Commission and joined the other groups stating that unless the Commission resigned of its own accord, it would be forced to do so. So, on the night of 15 March, Santer announced the mass resignation of his Commission. The morning following the resignation, against the recommendation of his advisors, Santer attacked the conclusions of Committee. The report was seen to be even in criticising not only PES members but also the workings of the Commission itself. It also exposed the situation that neither Parliament, nor the President, could force the resignation of individual Commissioners as they could only be 'recalled' by national governments. Paris refused to recall Cresson, who refused to resign of her own accord, which sparked the need for a mass resignation. Commissioner Mario Monti criticised this stating that \"This Commission has collectively resigned, I believe, not because of collective responsibility but because certain members of it preferred not to take their own individual responsibilities.\" Édith Cresson went before the European Court of Justice and, in July 2006, was found guilty but was not stripped of her pension. Cresson today is largely held accountable for the fall of Santer, who went on to serve time as an MEP and never fully recovered, and the rest of his Commission.\n\nThe immediate effect was that the politically weakened Commission was unable to react to the beginning of the Kosovo War and the close of the Agenda 2000 negotiations. The crisis had compounded the already reduced powers of the Commission in favour of the Parliament's legislative power, the Council's foreign policy role and the ECB's financial role. However the change with Parliament was the most profound, the previous permanent cooperation between the two bodies came to an end with the shift in power.\n\nIt was hoped by the leaders in Parliament that such a political challenge would generate useful publicity ahead of the elections, with previous polls producing a low turn out with a perception of the body being powerless. In this respect the affair did generate extensive media attention with the Parliament now seeming 'dramatic'. The committee report also was written in an unusually accessible manner, filled with soundbites. Further more it also drew greater attention from the Council to a Parliament willing to exercise its powers. Hence when the Council came in to agree on a new president, it was clear that the candidate had to be acceptable to parliament. The crisis also displayed the increasing party competition within the Parliament, leading to the development of a Parliamentary system between the executive and legislative branches. Indeed, it can be seen that the government-opposition dynamic of the two main parties in Parliament aggravated the development of the crisis and contributed to the downfall of the Commission.\n\nThe Prodi Commission, which succeeded Marín's caretaker administration, announced a zero-tolerance approach to fraud. Following pressure from Parliament, the Commission quickly established OLAF, an anti-fraud office which replaced the Unit for the Co-ordination of Fraud Protection (UCLAF) established in 1988 and seen as having failed in its duty. OLAF was established with more powers and to be more independent, especially in terms of investigation where they are formally autonomous from the Commission. There were a few members who survived the Santer Commission to continue under Prodi: Franz Fischler, Erkki Liikanen, Mario Monti and Neil Kinnock. The latter was appointed to undertake institutional reform.\n\nThe reappointment of some of these members showed that individual Commissioners still maintained their own reputations despite the massive loss of face of the institution as a whole, while Cresson would have never been able to have been reappointed. The Commission itself suffered from a loss of trust and reputation, only compounded by the post-Delors mood. Prodi had to deal with increased euroscepticism which helped bring down the Santer Commission. Since the end of the Delors era, pro-integrationism had given way with greater concern about the Commission's powers. By just 2000 the Council curbed the Commission's powers once more when they believed Prodi overstepped his remit.\n\nThe Commission college had 20 members (two for the largest five member states, one each for the remainder) and included Commissioners from new member states Sweden, Finland and Austria. Had Norway not rejected EU membership in 1995, their Commissioner would have been Thorvald Stoltenberg who was proposed as Commissioner for Fisheries;\n\n\n"}

The University of Florida was bestowed the honor of using the seal as its university seal.\n\nThe seal features a shoreline on which a Seminole woman is spreading flowers.

{"id": "762849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=762849", "title": "Stargate", "text": "Stargate\n\nStargate is a science fiction media franchise based on the film written by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. The franchise is based on the idea of an alien Einstein–Rosen bridge device (the Stargate) that enables nearly instantaneous travel across the cosmos. The franchise began with the film \"Stargate\", released on October 28, 1994, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Carolco, which grossed US$197 million worldwide. In 1997, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner created a television series titled \"Stargate SG-1\" as a sequel to the film. This show was joined by \"Stargate Atlantis\" in 2004, \"Stargate Universe\" in 2009, and a prequel web series, \"Stargate Origins\", in 2018. Also consistent with the same story are a variety of books, video games and comic books, as well as the direct-to-DVD movies \"\" and \"\", which concluded the first television show after 10 seasons.\n\nIn 2011, \"Stargate Universe\", the last \"Stargate\" program on television, ended its run. Brad Wright announced that there were no more plans to continue the same story in further productions. In 2016, comic publisher American Mythology acquired the rights to publish new \"Stargate Atlantis\" stories set within the established franchise canon. This was expanded in 2017 to include new \"Stargate Universe\" comics as well, resolving the cliffhanger that ended the show. The predominant story arc thus ran on television for 15 years, including 17 seasons (354 episodes) of programming, and 8 comic book issues as of July 2017. However, a variety of other media either ignore this main continuity or resets it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device). These include the 2002 animated series \"Stargate Infinity.\"\n\nIn 2017, the franchise was revived with the announcement of a new prequel web series, \"Stargate Origins\". Episodes premiered on a central \"fan hub\" for the franchise called Stargate Command, with a first season of ten 10-minute episodes.\n\n\"Stargate\" productions center on the premise of a \"Stargate,\" a ring-shaped portal that enables rapid transportation to other stargates located cosmic distances away. The story begins when one such device is discovered on Earth. The 1994 film and subsequent television series depict how the device is kept under the control of the United States government, who use it to conduct interplanetary missions by dialing the thousands of stargates located in the galaxy, which are the legacy of an ancient civilization. The expeditions originally had the goal of acquiring extremely rare resources, new technology and detecting threats; but often face scientific and humanitarian issues and the dilemmas of interacting with different societies. Finally they resulted in a unified \"United Nation\"-coalition to better support the constant need to continue the program to defend Earth from invading aliens.\n\nCombined with the notion that the Stargate is a secret, \"Stargate\" productions are notable for presenting no contradiction with reality, being set in the present day on an otherwise normal Earth, and being dominated by human interaction in the galaxy. In the story of the 1994 film, this is explained as being the result of forced deportations by aliens, with the suggestion that most ancient mythologies are the result of aliens posing as gods in the distant past (as in the unproven ancient astronaut hypothesis).\n\nThe longest-running series, \"Stargate SG-1\" sets the context having the \"Milky Way\" galaxy as a failed state in which Goa'uld System Lords war against each other. Goa'uld used superior technology to pose as gods to the human populations who had been deported from Earth to everywhere in the galaxy; these people are kept in poverty, ignorance and slavery. The US Stargate Command represents simultaneously a higher level of civilization and a lower level of technology during conflicts. Only a small portion of stargate dial numbers do not lead to planets dominated by the Goa'uld.\n\nDue to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various \"Stargate\" productions are not entirely consistent with each other; and while no set of works forms an official canon, the largest following exists for the three live-action series. Through the work of various authors and developers, at least six separate story cycles can be discerned, some of which are continuations of the other ones (either endorsed or unendorsed by their predecessor).\n\n\nIn 1994, the military science fiction feature film \"Stargate\" was released, directed by Roland Emmerich and co-written by Emmerich and Dean Devlin. The film lays the foundation for all the Stargate productions that come after it, by explaining the notion, function, and history of the Stargate.\n\nThe film begins with the unearthing of the Stargate in Giza in 1928. In a present day, \"i.e.\", 1994, military base in Creek Mountain, Colorado, discredited Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) enables use of the Stargate when he recognizes that symbols on the cover stones of the Stargate are asterisms used in a three dimensional coordinate system. A team led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) is ordered to step through the Stargate and identify potential military threats on the other side. Jackson accompanies them to operate the other Stargate with his knowledge of the coordinate system. The team discovers a slave civilization serving an alien who is posing as the Egyptian god Ra (Jaye Davidson). Ra and his minions have taken human form, dominating the slaves with brute force. With the help of the locals, O'Neil's team is eventually able to instigate a slave rebellion, overwhelming Ra's forces. Ra escapes in his mothership, but O'Neil is able to teleport a nuclear warhead on-board Ra's ship in orbit and detonate it. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with a young local woman named Sha'uri.\n\nAfter Bill McCay had written a series of five novels continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite the success of the \"Stargate\" television series, Dean Devlin stated in 2006 that \"he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original\" According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise. The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together. \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\" producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that \"Devlin can wish to do a sequel to \"Stargate\" all he wants. MGM owns the rights, and I doubt very much that they'll ask him to do it. He knows better.\"\n\nPlans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film's creator Dean Devlin at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con. He was in talks with MGM to produce four films and he wanted two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy. In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Devlin said that should the sequels be made, he hoped to enlist Kurt Russell and James Spader in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader expressed interest, Devlin revealed. \"They've always said they wanted to do it. The irony is actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [and] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We were just going to kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely.\" These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" if they are ever produced.\n\nDean Devlin spoke out again on July 4, 2011 stating that he hadn't given up on the idea of sequels to his 1994 feature film. He talked about the idea again in a new interview with Collider. Devlin actually wrote it as a trilogy of movies, but was never able to do parts two and three. His hope was, as the series started to wind down, that perhaps it would be time to actually get to do parts two and three.\n\nDevlin has said \"I think it'll change a little bit from our original idea since so many years have passed.\" \"We wanted to explore the idea of how the Stargates were built originally, and where else in the universe they exist, and why they exist — and where else they exist on Earth. We had really planned out, as a trilogy of films, to allow this mythology to grow bigger and bigger.\" It was announced that MGM and Warner Bros. are partnering with both Emmerich and Devlin for a reboot of Stargate as a trilogy with Emmerich directing and Devlin producing. On November 17, 2016, Devlin told Empire Online that the plans to make a reboot of a potential new series are stalled.\n\nIn 1997, Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright co-developed \"Stargate SG-1\", a television series intended to continue the story laid down by the original film. Although new actors were cast, several roles from the film were reprised, including the main characters Daniel Jackson and Jack O'Neill (which was re-spelled to include an extra \"L\"). The Stargate Command setting was transferred from a fictional military facility located in Creek Mountain, to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Other variations and differences between the original film and \"SG-1\" mostly concern the location of the planet Abydos, the alien Ra, the race of Ra's underlings (Jaffa), and Stargate travel.\n\nThe series debuted on Showtime on July 27, 1997, and moved to the Sci-Fi Channel after its fifth season. It starred Richard Dean Anderson (as O'Neill) and Michael Shanks (as Jackson), alongside Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge and Don S. Davis respectively playing the new characters Samantha Carter, Teal'c and George Hammond. The cast remained fairly regular for most of \"SG-1\"'s run, but experienced some changes. Michael Shanks left the show at the end of Season 5 and was replaced by Corin Nemec as Jonas Quinn. Shanks returned at the beginning of Season 7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season 7 Davis left the show and Anderson filled the gap he left in the story. Season 9 saw the departure of Anderson, but added new regulars Beau Bridges and Ben Browder. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, Claudia Black's popular reception earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.\n\nMGM put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regards it as one of its most important franchises. \"SG-1\" was taken off air in 2007; however, two direct-to-DVD movies entitled \"The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum\" were made to tie up loose ends.\n\nIn June 2009, \"Children of the Gods\", \"Stargate SG-1\"'s pilot episode, was re-cut into a \"Stargate SG-1\" direct-to-DVD movie with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version.\n\nThe \"Stargate Atlantis\" series follows the adventures of the \"Atlantis expedition\", a combination of military forces and civilian scientists that travel to the Pegasus Galaxy in search of the Lost City of Atlantis, left behind by the most powerful race known to ever have lived, referred to as the Ancients, also known as Lanteans and Alterans. The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of \"SG-1\"'s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the \"SG-1\" setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discovers Atlantis rests at the bottom of an ocean, protected by shields keeping the City habitable. As the Atlantis Expedition Team explores the myriad corridors and equipment, they quickly drain the already nearly depleted power source (known as a ZPM) allowing the shields to hold and Atlantis remain watertight. As an emergency default \"programme\", Atlantis detects this sudden power drop, activates a failsafe, the City surfaces, and appears as an island in the middle of an ocean.\n\nUsing small ships discovered in the City, Team Members fly and discover the mainland, where they explore, meet the Indigenous Population, and learn that the Pegasus Galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as the \"Wraith.\" Although first encountered whilst in a long-term hibernation state, the Expedition unintentionally and prematurely wakes the Wraith, alerting them to the reemergence of Atlantis, a new race of humans, and a potential new feeding ground: The Milky Way Galaxy. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Team must defend and protect the City, the Locals, and the entire Expedition. \n\n\"Stargate Atlantis\" was a spin-off television series from \"Stargate SG-1\". A new feature film was originally intended to transition the two series after the sixth season of \"SG-1\". Later, \"SG-1\" was renewed for a seventh season, and the feature film was then planned to transition that season. Finally, when \"SG-1\" was renewed for an eighth season, the intended film instead became the two-part season finale episode \"Lost City\", and the setting of \"Stargate Atlantis\" was moved to the Pegasus galaxy. This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same fictional universe, and later the two shows even become interconnected. \"Atlantis\" was developed by most of the same people and in the same studios as \"SG-1\".\n\n\"Atlantis\" debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 16, 2004, starring Joe Flanigan and Torri Higginson in the lead roles, with Rainbow Sun Francks, David Hewlett, and Rachel Luttrell alongside. Hewlett and Higginson's characters had previously appeared in \"SG-1\" (though Higginson inherited the role from actress Jessica Steen). In \"Atlantis\"' second season, Paul McGillion and Jason Momoa (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season 4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and Jewel Staite in a recurring role. Tapping left the show for season five to concentrate on \"Sanctuary\", and was replaced by Robert Picardo, who reprised his role as Richard Woolsey from both \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\". However, in late summer 2008 it was announced that SciFi would not renew \"Atlantis\". The final episode aired on January 9, 2009.\n\n\"Stargate Universe\" is the third live-action \"Stargate\" series, and premiered on October 2, 2009. The series was pitched to the Sci Fi Channel in the fall of 2007, just before the writer's strike—which put a hold on the project. \"The pitch was received very well,\" according to Stargate Atlantis co-creator Brad Wright. Sci Fi Channel ordered \"Universe\" after announcing the cancellation of \"Stargate Atlantis\". Syfy announced on December 16, 2010 that they would not pick the show up for a third season. The final episode aired May 9, 2011.\n\nAfter the events of \"Stargate Atlantis\", research into the Stargate's 9th and final chevron leads to an expedition being stranded several billion light years from earth on board an Ancient ship called \"Destiny\" which has been traveling through the universe unmanned for millions of years. The show follows the crew as they struggle to survive on board \"Destiny\" with no apparent way home. The show was intended to have a darker tone than its predecessors and delve more into the humanity of the characters and their relationships with each other.\n\n\"\" is a direct-to-DVD movie written and directed by Robert C. Cooper. The film is the conclusion of \"Stargate SG-1\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> Ori arc, and picks up after the SG-1 series finale, but takes place before the fourth season of \"Stargate Atlantis\". \"The Ark of Truth\" was released as a Region 1 DVD release on March 11, 2008. Sky One has broadcast the film on March 24, 2008, to be followed by the Region 2 DVD release on April 28, 2008, with the Region 4 DVD release on April 9, 2008.\n\n\"\" is a direct-to-DVD movie written by Brad Wright and directed by Martin Wood. Some scenes for this movie were already shot at the end of March 2007, but the original start date was set for May 22 at Vancouver's Bridge Studios. The production budget was $7 million. The movie was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 29, 2008. The Region 4 DVD was released on August 6, 2008 with the Region 2 DVD released on August 18, 2008; followed by possible TV broadcasts. The film is a time-travel adventure and is the second sequel to \"Stargate SG-1\", after \"Stargate: The Ark of Truth\".\n\nIn April 2009, MGM confirmed a third \"SG-1\" film that Brad Wright had first announced in May 2008. Wright was set to co-write the film with former \"Stargate Atlantis\" executive producer Carl Binder, with Martin Wood serving as director. According to Wright, the film would center on the Jack O'Neill character and reunite as many of the \"SG-1\" cast as possible, depending on the cost of the film and actor availability. Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) had confirmed his and Richard Dean Anderson's participation. Amanda Tapping confirmed her appearance in the third SG-1 film and the first \"Atlantis\" movie. According to Wright, the character of Vala Mal Doran would not appear in this film. The working title for the film, \"\" was revealed by Joseph Mallozzi in his blog.\n\nAccording to Sci-Fi and Joseph Mallozzi, a \"Stargate Atlantis\" two-hour direct-to-DVD movie was given the go ahead after the series was cancelled at the end of its fifth season. More movies were expected to follow in the Atlantis series if the first movie was successful. The rumored working title for the film was \"Stargate Extinction\". By May 2009 the script for the film was finished.\n\nOn April 17, 2011, \"Stargate\" writer and executive producer Brad Wright announced that the \"SGU\" movie is not going to happen. He also confirmed that the proposed \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" movies have been permanently shelved, along with another movie idea he had been trying to get a greenlight on that would have involved cast members of all three series. Still, Wright did not rule out future \"Stargate\" films, saying; \"It's a franchise. \"Stargate\" is not over. Somebody smart from MGM is going to figure it out, and something will happen.\"\n\nIn May 2014, MGM announced a re-imagined version of the original 1994 film to be produced as a trilogy with Warner Bros. Pictures. Emmerich will direct and Devlin will produce. This set of two sequel films to the original \"Stargate\" starring Kurt Russell and James Spader will take a dramatically different course than the \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" universe created in the following 15 years. On November 17, 2016, Devlin told Empire Online that the plans to make a reboot and potential new series are stalled.\n\nIn July 2017, a web series called \"Stargate Origins\" was announced at a San Diego Comic Con Panel celebrating the franchise's 20th anniversary. It focuses on the character of Catherine Langford and is a prequel to both the television continuity and the original feature film. The shooting began in August 2017 and series premiered online at the Stargate Command website on February 14, 2018.\n\nThe cast includes Ellie Gall as the young Catherine Langford, Connor Trinneer as Catherine's father, Professor Paul Langford, Aylam Orian as Dr. Wilhelm Brücke, a high-ranking Nazi officer, Philip Alexander as Captain James Beal, British officer stationed in Egypt., and Shvan Aladdin as Wasif, a native Egyptian and a lieutenant in the British army.\n\n\"Stargate Infinity\" is an American animated science fiction television series created by Eric Lewald and Michael Maliani as a spin-off from its sister show, \"Stargate SG-1\". The story arc in \"Infinity\" is set 30 years into the future and follows Gus Bonner and his team. Bonner's team was created after he was framed for a crime he did not commit. He escaped from Stargate Command (SGC) after the hostile alien race Tlak'kahn attacked the SGC to find the chrysalis. Together with his team he escapes through the Stargate with the chrysalis. From that point forward they go from planet to planet until they find the evidence to clear their names while learning about the unique cultures in the galaxy, so that they can one day return to Earth. The story arc was never resolved because of low viewership ratings and the show was cancelled in 2003.\n\n\"Stargate Infinity\" premiered in September 2002 as part of 4Kids Entertainment’s FOX BOX Saturday morning line-up on FOX and went off the air in June 2003. Due to its lack of popularity the show is almost completely unrecognized. The series was cancelled before any of its story arcs could be resolved. The show was of low budget, which was constantly noted by the media. DIC Entertainment released a 4-episode DVD on October 7, 2003 in Region 1. MGM Home Entertainment released a five disc season box set on August 13, 2007 in region 2. Shout! Factory, a company known for releasing cult animated series, acquired the rights to the show and released the entire series to DVD on May 13, 2008 in Region 1. , there is yet to come a release of \"Stargate Infinity\" package in Region 4, namely Oceania and Latin America.\n\nThe writers and producers of \"Stargate SG-1\", \"Stargate Atlantis\" and \"Stargate Universe\" and the main canon of the \"Stargate\" franchise were not involved with \"Infinity\", and neither MGM, the production teams nor the fans of \"Stargate\" consider \"Infinity\" to be an official part of the \"Stargate\" universe. According to \"Stargate SG-1\" co-creator Brad Wright, the animated series should not be considered official \"Stargate\" canon. Commenting on it, he stated, \"I don't have a problem with it. I'm just not involved.\"\n\n\"Stargate\" took in $16.7 million on its opening weekend, and received mixed reactions from critics; while it was panned by some critics such as Roger Ebert, several positive reviews counterbalanced this leading to a score of 46% on Rotten Tomatoes. Although the film was originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films, Emmerich and Devlin ultimately moved on to produce \"Independence Day\", and it was not until 2006 that Devlin showed renewed interest in developing sequels. In the intervening time, copyright-holder MGM succeeded the film with the television series \"Stargate SG-1\" without the input of Emmerich and Devlin.\n\n\"Stargate SG-1\" has won the Saturn Award for \"Best Syndicated Television Series\" on numerous occasions, and its cast has won similar awards for acting. More recently it has received acclaim for its visual effects, which increased in quality and realism as the show gained a larger budget. On August 21, 2006, the Sci Fi Channel announced that it would not be renewing \"Stargate SG-1\" for an eleventh season after a series of poor performances in the Nielsen ratings. Many fans were enraged at the news, even creating websites in reaction to exhibit their commitment to the series. Spokesmen for the production have said all options for the continuation of \"SG-1\" are being considered, including complete digital broadcasting. Executive producer Robert C. Cooper told the fansite GateWorld exclusively that he was working to continue \"SG-1\". Currently, no network or company has ordered new episodes of \"SG-1\", so the show is on hold until a new buyer can be found. However, SciFi has attempted to block other networks from taking up the show, citing its original exclusive contract with MGM. \"Atlantis\" proved to be equally as successful as \"SG-1\", with Nielsen ratings and viewership. The \"Stargate\" franchise in 2009 won a Constellation Award in the category of Outstanding Canadian Contribution to Science Fiction Film or Television in 2008.\n\nThe average viewership to \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" was around 10 million a week worldwide. According to \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" co-creator Brad Wright, the show is popular in Great Britain, Germany, France and Australia, but with a steadily declining viewership in homeland Canada. It was estimated that around 30 million \"Stargate\" DVDs were sold worldwide in 2006.\n\nThe DVD release of \"\" in the US earned MGM/Fox US $1.59 million in rentals in the first week after the release, and another US $1.38 million in rentals in the second week. In its third week it earned US $1.19 million in rentals totaling US $4.16 million. The DVD has also earned US $9.0 million in sales. \"\" would go on to gross over $8 million United States dollars in the United States. The film sparked mostly positive reviews with movie critics. A third \"Stargate SG-1\" movie was planned to follow \"Continuum\", but the third movie was put on hold with any other future Stargate movies; the film would have centered around the character of Jack O'Neill.\n\nThere are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original \"Stargate\" film and two based in the \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\" television shows. A series of books written by Bill McCay were published from 1995 to 1999 that were unofficial sequels to the film. These were produced by consulting the original notes made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, in an attempt to envision where the film \"would have gone\". Neither party has commented on whether McCay's interpretation was correct. Despite attempting to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series \"Stargate SG-1\" (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2001, ROC published four novels based in \"Stargate SG-1\" written by Ashley McConnell. In 2004, UK-based Fandemonium Press started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on \"Stargate SG-1\". Due to the conflict with ROC's license, these books were available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK, but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006. The official \"Stargate Magazine\", produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\".\n\nA series of comic books, based on \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\", began to be published by Avatar Press in 2003. Five have been published to date, with stories by James Anthony and artwork by Jorge Correa. In February 2008 it was announced that Big Finish Productions would release officially licensed audiobooks featuring members of the cast reading new stories. The first two stories, available on CD and digital download, are \"Gift of the Gods\" read by Michael Shanks and \"A Necessary Evil\" read by Torri Higginson.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50856", "title": "Trivial Pursuit", "text": "Trivial Pursuit\n\nTrivial Pursuit is a board game from Canada in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer general knowledge and popular culture questions.\n\nDozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as promotional tie-ins (such as \"Star Wars\", \"Saturday Night Live\", and \"The Lord of the Rings\" movies).\n\nThe game was created in December 1979 in Montreal in Quebec, by Canadian Chris Haney, a photo editor for Montreal's \"The Gazette\", and Scott Abbott, a sports editor for \"The Canadian Press\". After finding pieces of their \"Scrabble\" game missing, they decided to create their own game. With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981.\n\nIn North America, the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold. The rights to the game were initially licensed to Selchow and Righter in 1982, then to Parker Brothers (now part of Hasbro) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the Virgin Group; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million. , nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of Elroy, Wisconsin produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the \"Games Hall of Fame\" by \"Games\" magazine. An online version of \"Trivial Pursuit\" was launched in September 2003.\n\nThe object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of \"Trivial Pursuit\", these are Geography (blue), Entertainment (pink), History (yellow), Arts & Literature (originally brown, later purple), Science & Nature (green), and Sports & Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.\n\nPlaying pieces used in \"Trivial Pursuit\" are round and divided into six sections, similar to a cheese triangle. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese, can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress.\n\nDuring the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal \"hub\" space. At the end of each spoke is a \"category headquarters\" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, his turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say \"roll again,\" giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a \"wild\" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his choice. Questions must be answered without any outside assistance. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.\n\nOnce a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his playing piece, he must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.\n\nOver the years, numerous editions of \"Trivial Pursuit\" have been produced, usually specializing in various fields. The original version is known as the \"Genus\" edition (or \"Genus I\"). Several other general knowledge editions (such as \"Genus II\") have followed. Some include, Junior Edition (1985), All-Star Sports, Baby Boomers, 1980s, All About the 80s, and 1990s.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Trivial Pursuit\" players complained that the 2006 version of the game was \"dumbed down\" in comparison to previous editions, with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business.\n\nIn October 1984, Fred L. Worth, author of \"The Trivia Encyclopedia\", \"Super Trivia\", and \"Super Trivia II\", filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of \"Trivial Pursuit\". He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and deliberately placed misinformation. One of the questions in \"Trivial Pursuit\" was \"What was Columbo's first name?\" with the answer \"Philip\". That information had been fabricated to catch anyone who might try to violate his copyright.\n\nThe inventors of \"Trivial Pursuit\" acknowledged that Worth's books were among their sources, but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright. The district court judge agreed, ruling in favor of the \"Trivial Pursuit\" inventors. The decision was appealed, and in September 1987 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the ruling. Worth asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case, but the Court declined, denying certiorari in March 1988.\n\nIn 1994, David Wall of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, launched a lawsuit against the game's creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near Sydney, Nova Scotia, when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of the markers.\n\nWall's mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a \"Trivial Pursuit\"-like game, but the drawings had since been destroyed. Wall's friend, who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day, never testified. Haney said he never met Wall.\n\nOver the years, there was much legal wrangling, notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury. On June 25, 2007, the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled against Wall.\n\nA version of \"Trivial Pursuit\", hosted by Wink Martindale, aired on The Family Channel in the United States from 1993 to 1995 (Jay Wolpert had attempted a pilot in 1987, but it was not picked up). A syndicated version entitled \"\" aired from 2008 to 2009 and hosted by Christopher Knight. In September 2004, Roger Lodge hosted a sports trivia game show on ESPN entitled \"ESPN Trivial Pursuit\", which aired five episodes.\n\nBBC Television produced a \"Trivial Pursuit\" game show based on the game in the UK hosted by Rory McGrath. Another British version (with rules/format similar to the Wink Martindale version, and also using the same theme tune as the Wink Martindale version) was hosted on The Family Channel (now Challenge) by Tony Slattery. Birgit Lechtermann hosted a version for VOX in Germany from 1993 to 1994.\n\nIn 1988, a made-for-television movie entitled \"Breaking all the Rules: The Creation of Trivial Pursuit\" aired. Treated largely as a comedy, the movie featured the music of Jimmy Buffett and portrayed the creators of the game as three beer-loving Canadians.\n\nIn Spain, a version of the show called \"Trivial Pursuit: Spain Plays\" premiered in September 2008 on Antena 3.\n\nIn 1984, Bally Sente released a \"Trivial Pursuit\" arcade game. Like the board game, several variants were also released.\n\nBritish software company Domark released a home computer version (billed as \"Trivial Pursuit: The Computer Game\") for multiple formats during the 1980s. This version included pictorial and musical questions but was otherwise mostly faithful to the mechanics of the original board game.\n\nLater, Domark released another version called \"Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning\", also across multiple formats. This version featured a plot about the dying Earth and significantly altered gameplay mechanics.\n\nHasbro Interactive released a \"Millennium Edition\" in 1999 with three different modes, and different categories:\n\nThere are also three different ways to answer the questions:\n\nThis game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People & Places (blue wedge), Arts & Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science & Nature (brown wedge), Sports & Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge).\n\nIn 2003, Bolenka Games released an online game of \"Trivial Pursuit\" on the now-defunct website Uproar.comwhere it features five editions such as: \"Genius\", \"Silver Screen\", \"Music\", \"1980s\" and \"TV\".\n\nTrivial Pursuit was released for a number of home video systems, including Sega CD, Wii, Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4. The board game was also adapted into a mobile game called \"Trivia Crack\".\n\n"}
{"id": "16407195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16407195", "title": "Tronie", "text": "Tronie\n\nA tronie (16/17th-century Dutch for \"face\") is a common type, or group of types, of works common in Dutch Golden Age painting and Flemish Baroque painting that shows an exaggerated facial expression or a stock character in costume.\n\nThe term 'tronie' is not clearly defined in art historical literature. Literary and archival sources show that initially the term 'tronie' was not always associated with people. Inventories sometimes referred to flower and fruit still lifes as 'tronies'. More common was the meaning of face or visage. Often the term referred to the entire head, even a bust, and in exceptional cases the whole body. A tronie could be two-dimensional, but also made of plaster or stone. Sometimes a tronie was a likeness, the depiction of an individual, including the face of God, Christ, Mary, a saint or an angel. In particular a tronie denoted the characteristic appearance of the head of a type, for example a farmer, a beggar or a jester. Tronie sometimes meant so much as a grotesque head or a model such as the type of an ugly old person. When conceived as the face of an individual and of a type a tronie's aim was to express feelings and character in an accurate manner and must therefore be expressive.\n\nIn modern art-historical usage the term tronie is typically restricted to figures not intended to depict an identifiable person, so it is a form of genre painting in a portrait format. Typically a painted head or bust only, if concentrating on the facial expression, but often half-length when featured in an exotic costume, tronies might be based on studies from life or use the features of actual sitters. The picture was typically sold on the art market without identification of the sitter, and was not commissioned and retained by the sitter as portraits normally were. Similar unidentified figures treated as history paintings would normally be given a title from the classical world, for example the Rembrandt painting now known as \"Saskia as Flora\".\n\nThe genre started in the Low Countries in the 16th century where it was likely inspired by some of the grotesque heads drawn by Leonardo. Leonardo had pioneered drawings of paired grotesque heads whereby two heads, usually in profile, were placed opposite each other in order to accentuate their diversity. This paired juxtaposition was also adopted by artists in the Low Countries. In 1564 or 1565 Joannes and Lucas van Doetecum are believed to have engraved 72 heads attributed to Pieter Brueghel the Elder that followed this paired arrangement.\n\nThis paired model was still being used by some artists in the 17th century. For instance, the Flemish artist Jan van de Venne who was active in the first half of the 17th century painted a number of tronies juxtaposing different faces.\n\nSeveral Rembrandt self-portrait etchings are tronies, as are paintings of himself, his son and his wives. Three Vermeer paintings were described as \"tronies\" in the Dissius auction of 1696, perhaps including the \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" and the Washington \"\". Frans Hals also painted a number of tronies, which are now among his best-known works, including the two tronies known as \"Malle Babbe\" and the \"Gypsy Girl\" (see gallery).\n\nAdriaen Brouwer was one of the most successful practitioners of the genre as he had a talent for expressiveness. His work gave a face to lower-class figures by infusing their images with recognizable and vividly expressed human emotions—anger, joy, pain, and pleasure. His \"Youth Making a Face\" (c. 1632/1635, National Gallery of Art) shows a young man with a satirical and mocking gesture which humanises him, however uninviting he may appear. Brouwer's vigorous application of paint in this composition, with his characteristically short, unmodulated brushstrokes, increases the dramatic effect. Genre painters often returned to the old theme of the allegory of the five senses and created series of tronies depicting the five senses. Examples are Lucas Franchoys the Younger's \"A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch\" and Joos van Craesbeeck's \"The Smoker\" which represents taste.\n\nThe tronie is related to, and has some overlap with, the \"portrait historié\", a portrait of a real person as another, usually historical or mythological, figure. Jan de Bray specialised in these, and many portraitists sometimes showed aristocratic ladies in particular as mythological figures.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9730355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9730355", "title": "Vienna School of Art History", "text": "Vienna School of Art History\n\nThe Vienna School of Art History () was the development of fundamental art-historical methods at the University of Vienna. This school was not actually a dogmatically unified group, but rather an intellectual evolution extending over a number of generations, in which a series of outstanding scholars each built upon the achievements of their forerunners, while contributing their own unique perspectives. Essential elements of this evolution became fundamental for modern art history, even if the individual methods can today no longer claim absolute validity.\n\nA characteristic trait of the Vienna School was the attempt to put art history on a \"scientific\" (\"wissenschaftlich\") basis by distancing art historical judgements from questions of aesthetic preference and taste, and by establishing rigorous concepts of analysis through which all works of art could be understood. Nearly all of the important representatives of the Vienna School combined academic careers as university teachers with curatorial activity in museums or with the preservation of monuments.\n\nThe concept of a Viennese \"school\" of art history was first employed by the Czech art critic and collector Vincenc Kramář in 1910; it attained general currency following articles published by Otto Benesch in 1920 and by Julius von Schlosser in 1934. In the following entry it has only been possible to make cursory mention of the most important representatives of the school.\n\nRudolf Eitelberger is considered to have been the \"forefather\" of the Vienna School. He acquired a profound knowledge of art through private study during the Vormärz, and in 1852 was appointed as the first professor of art history at the University of Vienna. His greatest concern was to render the aesthetic appreciation of art more objective through giving weight to historical sources and demonstrable facts. He perceived art-historical research as an absolute prerequisite for the elevation of taste and for the improvement of contemporary art. On account of this goal-oriented attitude he became one of the most important protagonists in the historicist movement in Austrian art and architecture.\n\nThe first graduate of the Eitelberger's new program in art history was Moritz Thausing, who in 1879 became the second \"Ordinarius\" (full professor) of art history at Vienna. He advanced beyond his teacher's program in his advocacy of an autonomous art history and promoted the separation of art history from aesthetics.\n\nThausing's students Franz Wickhoff (Professor 1891) and Alois Riegl (Professor 1897) furthered his approach, insofar as they developed the methods of comparative stylistic analysis and attempted to avoid all judgements of personal taste. Thus both contributed to the revaluation of the art of late antiquity, which before then had been despised as a period of decline. Riegl in particular, as an avowed disciple of positivism, focused on the purely formal qualities of the work of art, and rejected all arguments about content as metaphysical speculation.\n\nAfter the early deaths of Riegl and Wickhoff, one of the art-historical positions at the University was filled by Max Dvořák, who at first continued the tradition of his predecessors. However, Dvořák's interest gradually turned towards issues of content; that is, to precisely those issues that, for Riegl, were not the object of art history. Dvořák, in part influenced by the contemporary expressionist movement in German painting, developed a deep appreciation for the unclassical formal qualities of Mannerism. Dvořák's idealistic method, which would later be termed \"Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte\" (\"art history as intellectual history\"), found its most committed champions in Hans Tietze and Otto Benesch.\n\nDvořák also died young, and in 1922 Julius von Schlosser was appointed as his successor. Schlosser embodied the type of the classical, humanistic scholar, and nourished a deep attachment to the art and culture of Italy throughout his life. He was a close friend of the Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce and of Karl Vossler, a Munich-based professor of the Romance languages, under whose influence he developed an art-historical method based on philological models. He drew a distinction between the \"Stilgeschichte\" (\"style-history\") of brilliant artists and their unique creations, and the \"Sprachgeschichte\" (\"language-history\") of the fine arts, which latter embraced the entire spectrum of artistic creation. Among those to emerge from Schlosser's school, besides Ernst Gombrich, were Hans Sedlmayr and Otto Pächt, who in the 1930s founded art-historical \"structuralism.\" Their methodology was described by Meyer Schapiro as the \"New Vienna School\"; it has also been described as the \"Second Vienna School.\"\n\nJosef Strzygowski, who was appointed in 1909, at the same time as Dvořák, holds a unique position in the history of the Vienna School. He was a vehement opponent of the traditional view of history, in place of which he advocated an anticlassical, antihumanist, and anticlerical outlook. In opposition to the standard view of history, which was centered on ancient Greece and Rome, Strzygowski turned his attention towards the Orient, where he thought he had discovered the traces of an original \"Nordic\" character, which was superior to the \"Mediterranean.\" As he held such a single-minded point of view, he found himself in irreconcilable opposition to the \"orthodox\" branch of the Vienna School, in particular to the \"arch-humanist\" Schlosser, who on his side condemned Strzygowski as the \"Attila of art history.\" The dispute resulted in a complete separation, not only ideological but also physical, so that two art-historical institutes existed within the University without any relationship to each other. As Strzygowski could naturally not allow himself to adopt the methods of his opponents, he devised a tabular method of \"\"Planforschung\",\" which was supposed to guarantee absolute objectivity, but in hindsight was completely impracticable and clearly intended to justify his abstruse theories. Strzygowski's worldview developed a markedly bizarre, racist tendency that approached Nazi ideology. However, his institute was closed upon his retirement in 1933. Nevertheless, he is to be credited with the expansion of the boundaries of western art history, which he opened to the consideration of non-European cultures. Moreover, his esteem for abstract art, which he understood as uniquely \"Nordic,\" was a step towards an art-historical confrontation with modernity. With all due care, then, Strzygowski may also find his proper place today in the history of the Vienna School.\n\nThe era of Nazism signified a turning point for the Vienna School. Numerous scholars were forced to emigrate and came into contact with the methdological approaches of other nations, in particular in the Anglo-American world. Hans Sedlmayr, a declared Nazi, led the institute throughout the war, and at war's end his career in Vienna likewise came to an end. In 1946, Karl Maria Swoboda assumed leadership of the \"Insitut\", where he constructed a synthesis of the previously irreconcilable schools of Schlosser and Strzygowski, now drained of their ideological intransigence. In 1963 two \"Ordinarius\" positions were once more created, and were filled by Otto Pächt (a student of Schlosser) and Otto Demus (a student of Strzygowski). Under the \"two Ottos\" Vienna became a \"Mekka der Mittelalterkunstgeschichte\" (\"a mecca for medieval art history\"), while also offering excellent coverage of post-medieval art through the appointment of Fritz Novotny. Today Werner Hoffmann, who developed the traditions of the school and adapted them for an intellectual engagement with contemporary art, may count as the youngest heir of the Vienna School.\n\nThis article is substantially based on the equivalent entry in the German Wikipedia.\n\n\n\"\n"}

It was created in 1869 to \"delight and educate\" (\"zabavi i pouci\"). Prominent cultural figures were editors-in-chief. In the first year, the magazine was managed by Đuro Deželić, then by Ivan Perkovac, Milivoj Dežman, Franjo Marković and Vjekoslav Klaić. \n\n\"Vienac\" soon became the main Croatian literary magazine of the second half of the 19th century, especially when it was managed by the greatest Croatian writer of the time, August Šenoa, from 1874 until his death in 1881. It is a showcase of the big literary names of the period. For example, Ksaver Šandor Gjalski published his first short story there in 1884. \"Vijenac\" also published translations of works by Zola, Daudet and Turgenev. From 1890 to 1896, it was edited by Josip Pasarić, a major critic of Croatian realism.\n\nBoth the content and the illustrations were on the level of the contemporary European literary magazines. \"Vienac\" was the only edition of Matica ilirska (the Illyrian Matrix) until Matica was restructured in 1874 to become the Matica hrvatska. After that, Vienac was published by a printing company. It died out in 1903.\n\nAfter its revival in 1993, \"Vijenac\" soon regained its prestige status as a prominent literary and arts publication. However, in late 1998 a group of top contributors (including the then editor-in-chief, Andrea Zlatar) left \"Vijenac\" and established \"Zarez\". \"Vijenac\" continued publishing with a new editorial staff. it had an estimated circulation of 7,000 copies.\n\n\n"}

He was probably of Greek origin in Amaseia and carried off when he was very young. \n\nHe was a slave in the court of Al-Musta'sim and went on to become a calligrapher in the Royal Court. He spent most of his life in Baghdad and converted to Islam. He studied with the female scholar and calligrapher, Shuhda Bint Al-‘Ibari, who was herself a student in the direct line of Ibn al-Bawwab. During the Mongol invasion of Baghdad (1258), he took refuge in the minaret of a mosque so he could finish his calligraphy practice, while the city was being ransacked. His career, however, flourished under Mongol patronage. \n\nHe refined and codified six basic calligraphic styles of the Arabic script. Naskh script was said to have been revealed and taught to the scribe in a vision. He improved on Ibn Muqla's style by replacing the straight cut reed pen with an oblique cut, which resulted in a more elegant script. He developed \"Yakuti\", a handwriting named after him, described as a thuluth of \"a particularly elegant and beautiful type.\"\n\nHe taught many students, both Arab and non-Arab.

{"id": "12386462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12386462", "title": "Yıldız Palace", "text": "Yıldız Palace\n\nYıldız Palace (, ) is a vast complex of former imperial Ottoman pavilions and villas in Istanbul, Turkey, built in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was used as a residence by the Sultan and his court in the late 19th century.\n\nYıldız Palace, meaning \"Star Palace\", was built in 1880 and was used by the Ottoman Empire Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II. The area of the palace was originally made of natural woodlands and became an imperial estate during the reign of Sultan Ahmed I (1603-1617). Various sultans after Ahmed I enjoyed vacationing on these lands and Sultans Abdülmecid I and Abdülaziz built mansions here.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Sultan Abdülhamid II left Dolmabahçe Palace because he feared a seaside attack on the palace, which is located at the shore of the Bosporus strait. He expanded the Yıldız Palace and ordered the renowned Italian architect Raimondo D'Aronco to build new buildings to the palace complex. When he moved there, the palace became the fourth seat of Ottoman government (the previous ones were the \"Eski Saray\" Old Palace in Edirne, and the Topkapı Palace and Dolmabahçe Palaces in Istanbul.\n\nThe palace is a complex of buildings including the State Apartments Büyük Mabeyn, Şale Pavilion, the Malta Pavilion, the Çadır Pavilion, the Yıldız Theater and Opera House, the Yıldız Palace Museum, and the Imperial Porcelain Factory. The Yıldız Palace Gardens are also a popular public site among the residents of Istanbul. A bridge connects the Yıldız Palace with the Çırağan Palace on the Bosporus through this garden.\n\nGovernment officials working for Abdülhamid II had their offices in this building.\n\nThe sultan’s residence was in the Şale Kiosk or pavilion. The building has two floors and a basement and constructed from a mix of wood and stone. It was constructed in three phases. The first part was built in the 1870s and was designed to resemble a Swiss chalet, hence the name \"Şale\". Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle were among the visitors to this part of the palace. The second section was added in 1889 to accommodate Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was the first foreign monarch to visit Constantinople. It was during this phase that the Sedefli Salon Mother-of-Pearl Salon was added. The name derives from the extensive use of mother-of-pearl that covered almost all of its surfaces. There are also detailed painted landscapes on the ceiling. The third section was also built for Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1898. The reception chamber was built during this period and remains the most impressive room in the entire Şale Pavilion. There is a single carpet on the floor that has an area greater than 400 square meters and was hand woven by 60 weavers. Elegant features of the chamber include a gilded, coffered ceiling and large mirrors. Abdülhamid II was a skilled carpenter and actually made some of the pieces of furniture that can be found in the Şale Pavilion.\n\nThe Malta Kiosk is a pavilion located in Yıldız Park to the north side of the wall separating Yıldız Palace. There are also two watching and resting pavilions in the grove being the rear garden of Çırağan Palace from the Abdül Aziz I period. The origin of the name is not certain: during the Ottoman era certain parts of palaces were called after the names of conquered places or important battles, so this name is given after the Siege of Malta 1565 siege of Malta.\n\nThe trial of Midhat Pasha took place in a tent behind the pavilion.\n\nIt was built by Sultan Abdülaziz (1861–76), who used them as prisons. Today it houses a café and restaurant.\n\nBuilt by Sultan Abdülhamid II in 1889, it has stars on its domed ceiling, a reference to the name of the Yıldız Palace, which means Star Palace. Because no one was allowed to have his back to the sultan, the positioning of the sultan’s balcony box meant that the first row seats were never used.\n\nThis used to be Abdülhamid II’s carpentry workshop and is now used to display art and objects from the palace.\n\nOpened in 1895, the factory was constructed to meet the demand of the upper classes for European-style ceramics. The bowls, vases and plates it produced often pictured idealized scenes of the Bosphorus. The building has an interesting appearance in that it resembles a European medieval castle.\n\nAfter the Ottoman Empire ended, the palace was used as a luxury casino before being converted into a guest house for visiting heads of state and royalty. Today it is a museum and its gardens can be used for private receptions, such as the Istanbul Antiques Fair at the Silahhane (Armoury) Hall, which usually takes place in November. The Istanbul office of the OIC is also located within the Yıldız Palace.\n\nIn Our days, in the museum are organized ceramic or porcelain art exhibitions as Yildiz İbram's 'Ottoman Caftans' ceramic exhibition organized between 1 November-1 December 2013 under the auspices of the 135 years of diplomatic relations between Romania and Turkey, creating a nice ambiance in a unique atmosphere and compatibility regarding the historical past of the palace.\n\nThe palace is in the Beşiktaş district of Istanbul and is open daily from 9:30 to 16:00, except on Mondays and Thursdays, from October to February; and between 9:30 to 17:00 from March to September.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was compiled in 1945 by members of the Zamorano Club, a Los Angeles-based group of bibliophiles. Collecting first editions of every volume on the list has become the goal of a number of book collectors, though to date only four people have completed the task.\n\nThe Zamorano Club was founded in 1928 and named for Agustín Vicente Zamorano, the first printer in California. A series of committees of Club members, including former American Smelting and Refining Company executive Henry Raup Wagner and bibliographer Robert Cowan, assembled a list of a hundred books, eventually whittled down to eighty. During this process, Cowan died, and his \"Bibliography of the History of California and the Pacific West\" was added to the list as a tribute.\n\nThe list contains significant works by a number of well-known authors like Mark Twain, John Muir, Bret Harte, and Robert Louis Stevenson, as well as obscure texts concerning geographical exploration and legal matters. Some of the works exist in very few, highly sought after copies, while others were quite common and not particularly valuable, until interest in the list caused their prices to rise. Book dealers often refer to items for sale using their \"Zamorano number\" or have special sections dedicated to items on the list.\n\nThomas Streeter was the first collector to assemble a complete collection of first editions of every item on the list. His collection was auctioned between 1966 and 1969. Businessman Frederick William Beinecke was the second. Retired investment counselor Henry H. Clifford completed his collection in 1988 and his collection was auctioned in 1995. The fourth was architect Daniel Volkmann, who completed his collection in 1994, and it was auctioned in 2003. Many other collectors have pursued this goal, including notorious bibliomane and book thief Stephen Blumberg.\n\nOnly one institution, the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Yale University, possesses a complete collection of the Zamorano 80, donated by Frederick W. Beinecke. Both the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley and the Huntington Library in San Marino, California possess all but one of the volumes.\n\nThe rarest book on the list is number 64, the dime novel \"The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta\" by John Rollin Ridge writing as \"Yellow Bird\". Only two first-edition copies are known to exist, each used twice to complete the list. It may be on the list only because Wagner owned a copy, which he sold to Streeter. When Streeter's collection was being periodically auctioned, the auction of this copy was moved up over a year so the elderly Beinecke would be able to complete his Zamorano collection. This copy is now in the Beinecke Library with the rest of Beinecke's Zamorano books. Clifford purchased the second copy from a collector in Maine, which in turn was purchased by Volkmann at the auction of Clifford's collection. The book has been described with terms like \"Holy Grail\" and \"rara avis\" and is highly desired by collectors. Blumberg wanted it so much he and his accomplices planned and researched a potential burglary of Clifford's house when that collector owned the book. \n\nThe works on the list are numbered in alphabetical order by author (or title, in the case of numbers 14, 35, and 62) and were not intended to be any sort of ranking of literary or financial value.\n\n"}
