The parameters of inclusion vary from fair to fair: some only include publications which are themselves considered art objects, limited edition art books, artist multiples or books specifically about an art topic; others are wider to include graphic novels, cultural magazines, zines, creative writing, poetry, and other artist projects. Like other art fairs, an art book fair will not only include works for sale but also artist installations, projects, happenings, workshops, talks, panel discussions or book launches. Recursive fairs may run with a yearly theme or prompt which guides programming.\n\nUnlike a traditional trade fair or book fair (such as the Frankfurt Book Fair), art book fairs are public and less formal in regards to industry conferencing or networking; while they do serve as an opportunity for publishers and artists to commingle, the nature of art book sales is such that there are no sales or rights marketing as with a regular book fair. Instead, art book fairs are an aspect of artist-run culture and an address to artmaking in the neoliberal era. Art book fairs are also a way for viewers to interact with, collaborate, and learn with and obtain artwork outside of commercial art institutions. Given the ephemeral and mass-produced nature of publishing history, \"publishing seems to offer,\" as Offprint Paris director Yannick Bouillis put it, \"an authentic, autonomous space within the art community. Books and other publishing artifacts such as magazines, posters, and tapes are—in comparison to artworks—relatively free from public and market concerns.\"\n\nOne early example of art book fair as differentiated from trade book fairs or art exhibitions is by artist-run non-profit organization Printed Matter, which emerged in New York City in the 1960s. Printed Matter began a bookstore and gallery which celebrated publishing as an artistic medium, artist-run culture, and alternative art practice, an ethos which has carried through to contemporary art book events. In 2004 Printed Matter and then director, artist AA Bronson, launched the first New York Art Book Fair, and later the LA Art Book Fair in 2013. These fairs have grown steadily to an audience well beyond the local art scenes or literati: the 2015 NY Art Book Fair was host to 370 exhibitors from 28 countries and had an estimated 35,000 guests in attendance.\n\nAs with the Printed Matter model, art book fairs have emerged around the world as a way for artist-run or non-profit institutions to generate awareness with a broader public and fundraise through the sale of admission, special event tickets, and limited edition artwork. Other fairs include the Vancouver Art Book Fair, Canada's first international art book fair, the London Art Book Fair and Tokyo Book Fair.\n\n"}

They painted a variety of subjects, including portraits, landscapes, urban scenes and still lifes, in a mix of Modernist and traditional styles.\n\nThe ten female artists who are together known as the Beaver Hall Group were:\nAll ten of the group's participants had studied under William Brymner (1855–1925), a prominent Canadian artist who encouraged them to explore new modernistic approaches to painting. In an era when women artists were viewed as little more than hobbyists and were left out of the mainstream world of professional art, the Beaver Hall Group was the first Canadian artists association in which women played a central role.\n\nThe group was formally founded in May 1920, inaugurated through the efforts of Randolph Stanley Hewton, Edwin Holgate, Mabel May and Lilias Torrance Newton. The group's name derives from 305 Beaver Hall Hill, the location of the downtown Montreal studio where its members shared space. It counted among the founding members eleven men and eight women. In addition to Hewton, Holgate, May and Newton, original members included Mabel Lockerby, Anne Savage, and President of the group, A.Y. Jackson.\n\nThe first Beaver Hall exhibition took place January 17, 1921. In his opening speech, Jackson emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel \"with utter disregard for what\nhas hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. 'Schools' and 'isms' do not trouble us,\" Jackson stressed, \"individual expression is our chief concern\". He identified its goals as being those of the Group of Seven, and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits and correspondence. He kept them informed of events in Toronto and arranged for their works to be included in the Group of Seven exhibitions. Both the \"Montreal Gazette\" and \"La Presse\" gave generous coverage to the vernissage.\n\nThe association only survived for two years, during which time they held only four exhibitions with many different artists exhibiting among them. In 1924, the Beaver Hall Group gave up their rented studio but maintained their working studios at home. Many of the women from the Beaver Hall Group exhibited with the all-male Group of Seven internationally. When the Group of Seven formally disbanded in 1932, the women of the Beaver Hall Group helped establish the Canadian Group of Painters in 1933, to provide exhibition opportunities. Nevertheless, Group artists maintained an information association into the early 1960s.\n\nThe current understanding of the Beaver Hall Group as a group of Montreal-based women painters can be traced back to Nora McCullough's (National Gallery of Canada liaison to Western Canada) 1966 traveling exhibition \"The Beaver Hall Hill Group\". Until that time, the ten women who had continued their informal network after the disbanding of the formal Beaver Hall Group had not had a name for their association. McCollough's aim was to expose the talent of Quebec's women artists to western Canada. Anne Savage and A.Y. Jackson had told her about the original Beaver Hall Group and the name of the group became somehow confused with the name of the street, which is how the exhibition got its name.\n\nMore recently, curators have discovered a new dimension of Canadian modernism in the Beaver Hall Group. In contrast to the familiar modernist icons of the Toronto-based Group of Seven, the Montreal Beaver Hall painters were occupied with distinctly urban subjects: industry, fashion, and city life. Commenting on a recent exhibition, \"1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group\" at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, co-curator Brian Foss said, \"As fascinating and important as the Group of Seven was, it wasn't the only word on Canadian Modernism. Hopefully visitors will be struck by the extraordinary vibrancy, diversity and sheer quality of the art, and will come away with enhanced admiration for the real contributions Montreal artists made to Modernist art in this country.\"\n\n\nPepita Ferrari (1994). \"By Woman's Hand\", produced by the National Film Board of Canada.

He is known for discovering a number of important lost artworks by Old Master artists, including Sir Peter Paul Rubens, Claude Lorrain and Peter Brueghel the Younger. As a dealer he specialises in Old Masters, with a particular interest in Anthony van Dyck.\n\nDuring 2011 - 2016 he performed specialist research for, and appeared in, the BBC1 art programme, \"Fake or Fortune?\" He then presented the BBC4 series \"Britain's Lost Masterpieces\" with Jacky Klein and Emma Dabiri, which ran from 2016 - 2017.\n\nGrosvenor was educated at Harrow School, Pembroke College, Cambridge and the University of East Anglia where he completed his PhD entitled \"The Politics of Foreign Policy: Lord Derby and the Eastern Crisis, 1875-8\". Before becoming an art historian he worked in politics, first as an adviser to the Labour MP Tony Banks, Lord Stratford, and then to the Conservative MP Hugo Swire.\n\nHis first major art discovery was a mis-catalogued portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence in 2003 that was being sold at a London auction as a work by Lawrence's pupil, George Henry Harlow. From 2005 until 2014 he worked for Philip Mould Ltd, where he made a number of significant art historical discoveries, including lost works by artists such as Sir Joshua Reynolds, Thomas Gainsborough, and Sir Anthony Van Dyck, on whom he is an acknowledged specialist. He now has his own company, and specialises in establishing the authenticity of paintings. He recently sold a newly identified portrait by Joan Carlile, the first professional British female artist, to the Tate gallery. \n\nIn 2017 he discovered the \"lost portrait\" of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham at Pollok House, Glasgow, Scotland. The painting was thought to be a copy of a painting by Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens that had been lost for nearly 400 years, but after restoration was found to be the original by Rubens.\n\nGrosvenor has been a member of the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on National Records and Archives, and the Lord Chancellor's Forum for Historical Manuscripts and Academic Research. He also works as a journalist and writer, and presents programmes for BBC2's \"The Culture Show\".\n\nGrosvenor has made a special study of Jacobite portraiture. In 2009 he proved that the Scottish National Portrait Gallery's iconic portrait of Charles Edward Stuart by Maurice Quentin de La Tour was in fact a portrait of Charles' brother, Henry Benedict Stuart, Cardinal York. \n\nIn 2013 he discovered the lost portrait of Charles Edward Stuart by Scottish artist Allan Ramsay at Gosford House, the home of the Earl of Wemyss near Edinburgh. This portrait is now on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery, and has taken the place of the La Tour pastel as the definitive portrait of Charles.\n\nThe name \"Bendor\" is derived from the Grosvenor family's medieval heraldic shield, \"a bend or\", a golden bend (diagonal stripe), which they used until 1389 when it was claimed instead by the Scrope family, in the case Scrope v Grosvenor. The 2nd Duke of Westminster was nicknamed \"Bendor\". \n\nBendor is the grandson of The 5th Baron Ebury, and the 4th cousin once removed of The 7th Duke of Westminster. (He is fourth in line to the Marquessate of Westminster after The 8th Earl of Wilton, Viscount Grey de Wilton, and his first cousin Alexander Grosvenor.) He is also of Swiss heritage.\n\n\n"}

It was also called \"Langobarda\", \"Longobarda\", \"Longobardisca\" (signifying its origins with the Lombards), or sometimes \"Gothica\"; it was first called \"Beneventan\" by palaeographer E. A. Lowe.\n\nIt is mostly associated with Italy south of Rome, but it was also used in Beneventan-influenced centres across the Adriatic Sea in Dalmatia. The script was used from approximately the mid-8th century until the 13th century, although there are examples from as late as the 16th century. There were two major centres of Beneventan usage: the monastery on Monte Cassino, and Bari. The Bari type developed in the 10th century from the Monte Cassino type; both were based on Roman cursive as written by the Langobards. In general the script is very angular. According to Lowe, the perfected form of the script was used in the 11th century, while Desiderius was abbot of Monte Cassino, declining thereafter.\n\nBeneventan features many ligatures and \"connecting strokes\" – the letters of a word could be joined together by a single line, with forms almost unrecognizable to a modern eye.\nLigatures may be obligatory as: , , , and (two different forms: \"ti-dura\" where had kept the t sound and \"ti-assibilata\" where t had taken the vulgar ts sound). They may be optional: frequent as , and ; or rare as , and .\nLigatures involving the letter resemble late New Latin Cursive as in the Merovingian and Visigothic, exception made for peculiar ligature where is connected to on top influencing later on the German pre-caroline script and all the script from this derived until nowadays. In ligatures can take many forms depending on the letter joined to it. Ligatures with the letters and are also common. In early forms of Beneventan, the letter has an open top, similar to the letter ; later, it resembled \"cc\" or \"oc\", with long tails hanging to the right. In the Bari type, the letter often has a \"broken\" form, resembling the Beneventan form of the letter . However, itself has a very long middle arm, distinguishing it from . The letter can have a vertical or left-slanting ascender, the letter resembles the uncial form, and the letter is very tall and resembles .\n\nThe script has a unique way to signify abbreviations both by omission and contraction – like most other Latin scripts, missing letters can be signified by a macron over the previous letter, although Beneventan often adds a dot to the macron. There is also a symbol resembling the digit , or a sideways , when the letter has been omitted. In other scripts there is often little or no punctuation, but standard punctuation forms were developed for the Beneventan script, including the basis for the modern question mark.\n\nBeneventan shares some features with Visigothic and Merovingian script, probably due to the common late Roman matrix.\n\n\n"}

Tribe members waiting below closed in with spears and bows to finish the kills. The Blackfoot Indians called the buffalo jumps \"pishkun\", which loosely translates as \"deep blood kettle\". This type of hunting was a communal event which occurred as early as 12,000 years ago and lasted until at least 1500 AD, around the time of the introduction of horses. The broader term game jumps includes buffalo jumps and cliffs used for similarly hunting other herding animals, such as reindeer. The Indians believed that if any buffalo escaped these killings then the rest of the buffalo would learn to avoid humans, which would make hunting even harder.\n\nBuffalo jump sites are often identified by rock cairns, which were markers designating \"drive lanes\", by which bison would be funneled over the cliff. These drive lanes would often stretch for several miles.\n\nBuffalo jump sites yield significant archaeological evidence because processing sites and camps were always nearby. The sites yield information as to how the Native Americans used the bison for food, clothing and shelter. Plains Indians in particular depended on the bison for their very survival. Every part of the animal could be used in some way: hides for clothes and shelter, bones for tools, sinews for bowstrings and laces. Hooves could be ground for glue, and the brains could be used in the tanning process for the hides. The extra meat was preserved as pemmican.\n\nIn one of his journals, Meriwether Lewis describes how a buffalo jump was practiced during the Lewis and Clark Expedition:\n\none of the most active and fleet young men is selected and disguised in a robe of buffalo skin... he places himself at a distance between a herd of buffalo and a precipice proper for the purpose; the other Indians now surround the herd on the back and flanks and at a signal agreed on all show themselves at the same time moving forward towards the buffalo; the disguised Indian or decoy has taken care to place himself sufficiently near the buffalo to be noticed by them when they take to flight and running before them they follow him in full speed to the precipice; the Indian (decoy) in the mean time has taken care to secure himself in some cranny in the cliff... the part of the decoy I am informed is extremely dangerous.\n\nDespite having described a jump in detail, neither Lewis nor any white settlers are known to have personally witnessed the events.\n\nSites of interest include Head-Smashed-In, Bonfire Shelter, Ulm Pishkun, Madison Buffalo Jump, Dry Island, Glenrock, Big Goose Creek, Cibolo Creek, Vore, Too Close for Comfort Site, Olsen-Chubbuck Bison Kill Site, and Camp Disappointment of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n\nUlm Pishkun Buffalo Jump is likely the largest buffalo jump in the world. It was used by the Native Americans in the area between 900 and 1500 AD. The cliffs themselves stretch for more than a mile and the site below has compacted bison bones nearly deep. Ulm Pishkun Buffalo Jump is located in First Peoples Buffalo Jump State Park in Cascade County, Montana, north-northwest of the community of Ulm.\n\nMadison Buffalo Jump State Park is a Montana state park in Gallatin County, Montana in the United States. The park is and sits at an elevation of . The park is named for a canyon cliff used by Native Americans as a buffalo jump, where herds of bison were stampeded over the cliff as an efficient means of slaughter. This limestone cliff was used for 2,000 years by Native Americans. Madison Buffalo Jump State Park is a day use-only park. It is open year-round for hiking, wildlife observation, and some picnicking.\n\nCamp Disappointment, the northernmost point of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, is among the best-preserved buffalo jumps in Montana, due to its relatively inaccessible location. The creek at the bottom of the cliff periodically exposes animal bones.\n\nThere is a 3-D reconstruction of Charles M. Russell's painting of a buffalo jump on display at the Helena State Capital Museum, Helena, Montana.\n\n"}

It was less vast than the area occupied by the Lipiţa culture, encompassing today's Pokuttya, Maramureş, Bucovina and to a lesser extent, Northwest Moldova.\n\nThe arrival of East Germanic tribes in the Upper Dniester region forced the Costoboci to withdraw or crowd into the Carpathians at the end of the 2nd century AD and the beginning of the 3rd, where a part of them were already living. Other groups migrated to the area of the Carpi people (Moldova) or remained to live together with the newly arrived peoples of the Przeworsk culture.\n\nMost of the material evidence of the culture suggests it was Dacian. Tumuli tomb building disappeared from Roman Dacia with the coming of Imperial administration, but it continued to exist in the unconquered north of Dacia, a sign that the local population kept its ancestral traditions. The demarcation line is fairly clear, since the neighbour Przeworsk peoples did not have tumular tombs. As in the Lipiţa culture, the dead were cremated and their ashes were put in urns which were buried in the tumuli. The difference with the Carpathian Tumuli culture is that plane tombs are no longer found, but only (or almost only) tumular tombs.\n\nAfter Roman emperor Theodosius I defeated the neighbouring Carpi people in 381 AD, the people of the Carpathian Tumuli culture lost an important ally and this archaeological culture dissipates soon after, its place being taken by another one, the Sântana de Mureș–Chernyakhov culture, which also replaces the Poieneşti – Lucaşevca culture in the Northwestern Moldavian Subcarpathians, formed by the Bastarnae between the Costoboci and the Carpi.\n\nWe can follow the Costoboci even after the beginning of the 5th century, the newly formed Prague-Korchak culture being linked to the Carpathian Tumuli. There was no chronological break between the two cultures; the Costoboci remained on their territories, but now start to receive not only Slavic-type material culture elements, but also some Slavic population.\n\n"}
{"id": "33891441", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33891441", "title": "Catena (linguistics)", "text": "Catena (linguistics)\n\nIn linguistics, the catena (English pronunciation: , plural catenas or catenae; from Latin for \"chain\") is a unit of syntax and morphology, closely associated with dependency grammars. It is a more flexible and inclusive unit than the constituent and may therefore be better suited than the constituent to serve as the fundamental unit of syntactic and morphosyntactic analysis. \n\nThe catena concept was introduced to linguistics by William O'Grady in 1998 and has been seized upon by other linguists and applied to the syntax of idiosyncratic meaning of all sorts, such as ellipsis mechanisms (e.g. gapping, stripping, VP-ellipsis, pseudogapping, sluicing, answer ellipsis, comparative deletion), predicate-argument structures, and discontinuities (topicalization, wh-fronting, scrambling, extraposition, etc.). The catena concept has also been taken as the basis for a theory of morphosyntax, i.e. for the extension of dependencies into words; dependencies are acknowledged between the morphs that constitute words. \n\nWhile the catena concept has been applied mainly to the syntax of English, other works are also demonstrating its applicability to the syntax and morphology of other languages.\n\nIn terms of graph theory, any syntactic tree or connected subgraph of a tree is a catena. In this regard, every constituent is a catena, but there are many catenae that are not constituents. The constituent is therefore a subtype of catena. Any individual element (word or morph) or combination of elements linked together in the vertical dimension is a catena. Sentence structure is conceived of as existing in two dimensions. Combinations organized along the horizontal dimension (in terms of precedence) are called \"strings\", whereas combinations organized along the vertical dimension (in terms of dominance) are catenae. In terms of a cartesian coordinate system, strings exist along the \"x\"-axis, and catenae along the \"y\"-axis.\n\nAn understanding of the catena is established by distinguishing between the catena and other, similarly defined units. There are four units (including the catena) that are pertinent in this regard: \"string\", \"catena\", \"component\", and \"constituent\". The definition of the catena is repeated for easy comparison with the definitions of the other three units:\n\nA component is complete if it includes all the elements that its root node dominates. The string and catena complement each other in an obvious way, and the definition of the constituent is essentially the same as one finds in most theories of syntax, where a constituent is understood to consist of \"any node plus all the nodes that that node dominates\". These definitions will now be illustrated with the help of the following dependency tree. The capital letters serve to abbreviate the words:\n\nAll of the distinct strings, catenae, components, and constituents in this tree are listed here:\n\nNoteworthy is the fact that the tree contains 39 distinct word combinations that are not catenae, e.g. AC, BD, CE, BCE, ADF, ABEF, ABDEF, etc. Observe as well that there are a mere six constituents, but 24 catenae. There are therefore four times more catenae in the tree than there are constituents. The inclusivity and flexibility of the catena unit becomes apparent. The following Venn diagram provides an overview of how the four units relate to each other:\n\nIdiosyncratic language of all sorts can be captured in terms of catenae. When meaning is constructed in such a manner that does not allow one to acknowledge meaning chunks as constituents, the catena is involved. The meaning bearing units are catenae, not constituents. This situation is illustrated here in terms of various collocations and proper idioms.\n\nSimple collocations (i.e. the co-occurrence of certain words) demonstrate well the catena concept. The idiosyncratic nature of particle verb collocations provide the first group of examples: \"take after\", \"take in\", \"take on\", \"take over\", \"take up\", etc. In its purest form, the verb \"take\" means 'seize, grab, possess'. In these collocations with the various particles, however, the meaning of \"take\" shifts significantly each time depending on the particle. The particle and \"take\" convey a distinct meaning together, whereby this distinct meaning cannot be understood as a straightforward combination of the meaning of \"take\" alone and the meaning of the preposition alone. In such cases, one says that the meaning is \"non-compositional\". Non-compositional meaning can be captured in terms of catenae. The word combinations that assume non-compositional meaning form catenae (but not constituents):\n\nBoth the a- and b-sentences show that while the verb and its particle do not form a constituent, they do form a catena each time. The contrast in word order across the sentences of each pair illustrates what is known as shifting. Shifting occurs to accommodate the relative weight of the constituents involved. Heavy constituents prefer to appear to the right of lighter sister constituents. The shifting does not change the fact that the verb and particle form a catena each time, even when they do not form a string.\n\nNumerous verb-preposition combinations are idiosyncratic collocations insofar as the choice of preposition is strongly restricted by the verb, e.g. \"account for\", \"count on\", \"fill out\", \"rely on\", \"take after\", \"wait for\", etc. The meaning of many of these combinations is also non-compositional, as with the particle verbs. And also as with the particle verbs, the combinations form catenae (but not constituents) in simple declarative sentences:\n\nThe verb and the preposition that it demands form a single meaning-bearing unit, whereby this unit is a catena. These meaning-bearing units can thus be stored as catenae in the mental lexicon of speakers. As catenae, they are concrete units of syntax.\n\nThe final type of collocations produced here to illustrate catenae is the complex preposition, e.g. \"because of\", \"due to\", \"inside of\", \"in spite of\", \"out of\", \"outside of\", etc. The intonation pattern for these prepositions suggests that orthographic conventions are correct in writing them as two (or more) words. This situation, however, might be viewed as a problem, since it is not clear that the two words each time can be viewed as forming a constituent. In this regard, they do of course qualify as a catena, e.g.\n\nThe collocations illustrated in this section have focused mainly on prepositions and particles and they are therefore just a small selection of meaning-bearing collocations. They are, however, quite suggestive. It seems likely that all meaning-bearing collocations are stored as catenae in the mental lexicon of language users.\n\nFull idioms are the canonical cases of non-compositional meaning. The fixed words of idioms do not bear their productive meaning, e.g. \"take it on the chin\". Someone who \"takes it on the chin\" does not actually experience any physical contact to their chin, which means that \"chin\" does not have its normal productive meaning and must hence be part of a greater collocation. This greater collocation is the idiom, which consists of five words in this case. While the idiom \"take it on the chin\" can be stored as a VP constituent (and is therefore not a problem for constituent-based theories), there are many idioms that clearly cannot be stored as constituents. These idioms are a problem for constituent-based theories precisely because they do not qualify as constituents. However, they do of course qualify as catenae. The discussion here focuses on these idioms since they illustrate particularly well the value of the catena concept.\n\nMany idioms in English consist of a verb and a noun (and more), whereby the noun takes a possessor that co-indexed with the subject and will thus vary with subject. These idioms are stored as catenae but clearly not as constituents, e.g.\n\nSimilar idioms have a possessor that is freer insofar as it is not necessarily co-indexed with the subject. These idioms are also stored as catenae (but not as constituents), e.g.\n\nThe following idioms include the verb, and object, and at least one preposition. It should again be obvious that the fixed words of the idioms can in no way be viewed as forming constituents:\n\nThe following idioms include the verb and the prepositional phrase at the same time that the object is free:\n\nAnd the following idioms involving a ditransitive verb include the second object at the same time that the first object is free:\n\nCertainly sayings are also idiomatic. When an adverb (or some other adjunct) appears in a saying, it is not part of the saying. Nevertheless, the words of the saying still form a catena:\n\nEllipsis mechanisms (gapping, stripping, VP-ellipsis, pseudogapping, answer fragments, sluicing, comparative deletion) are eliding catenae, whereby many of these catenae are non-constituents. The following examples illustrate gapping:\n\nThe a-clauses are acceptable instances of gapping; the gapped material corresponds to the catena in green. The b-clauses are failed attempts at gapping; they fail because the gapped material does not correspond to a catena. The following examples illustrate stripping. Many linguists see stripping as a particular manifestation of gapping where just a single remnant remains in the gapped/stripped clause:\n\nThe a-clauses are acceptable instances of stripping, in part because the stripped material corresponds to a catena (in green). The b-clauses again fail; they fail because the stripped material does not qualify as a catena. The following examples illustrate answer ellipsis:\n\nIn each of the acceptable answer fragments (a–e), the elided material corresponds to a catena.

The journal's full title was Central Asian Review: A Quarterly Review of Current Developments in Soviet Central Asia and Kazakhstan and was published quarterly by the Central Asian Research Centre in association with St. Antony's College, Oxford University. Founder and director of the center, Geoffrey Wheeler was the editor-in-chief and frequent contributor to the journal.\n\n\"Central Asian Review\" was one of the primary venues for scholarly articles concerning Central Asia and was the main English language source for digests of Soviet press coverage of Central Asia. The journal was notable because it was one of the few periodicals of Central Asian Studies published during a time when research in the field was difficult, due to Soviet censorship and travel restrictions for researchers. In 1968 Wheeler left the Central Asian Research Center and the following year “Central Asian Review” was incorporated into the journal \"Mizan\", published by the center from 1965 to 1971.\n"}
{"id": "1945341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1945341", "title": "Dative construction", "text": "Dative construction\n\nThe dative construction is a grammatical way of constructing a sentence, using the dative case. A sentence is also said to be in dative construction if the subject and the object (direct or indirect) can switch their places for a given verb, without altering the verb's structure (subject becoming the new object, and the object becoming the new subject). The latter case is not to be confused with the passive voice, where only the \"direct\" object of a sentence becomes the subject of the passive-voiced sentence, and the verb's structure also changes to convey the meaning of the passive voice. The dative construction tends to occur when the verb indicates a state rather than an action.\n\nIn German, the dative construction sometimes occurs with the verb \"sein\" (\"to be\"). Compare:\n\nThe first example implies that the speaker has a cold personality. The subject here (\"ich\", \"I\") is in the nominative case. The second construction is used when one wants to say \"I am (feeling) cold\" in German. While in English the subject of the sentence \"I am cold\" is \"I\", in German the subject of the sentence \"Mir ist kalt\" is \"kalt\" and \"mir\" (\"me\"-DATIVE) is the indirect object. The use of the nominative form equivalent to \"I\" is only possible with a different meaning: \"Ich bin kalt\"='I am cold (in personality)'. \"Mir\" behaves like a subject and can control infinitives:\n\n\"Mir war zu kalt um zur Kirche zu gehen\"\n\nme.DAT was too cold for to.the.Fem.D church to go.INFIN\n\n'I was too cold to go to church' (\"I\" go, not \"cold\")\n\nDative constructions are extremely common in Icelandic. Their use is similar to that of German, although perhaps somewhat more widespread. The following example is exactly the same as the German one given above:\n\nThe implication of the first example is the same as in German, that the speaker has a cold personality rather than feeling physically cold. Dative constructions appear in many fixed expressions such as this, such as \"mér er alveg sama\" (\"I don't care\", lit. \"to me it's completely the same\"), \"henni er annt um umhverfið\" (\"she cares about the environment\", lit. \"to her is dear about the environment\") and \"þú getur fengið nýjan síma þér að kostnaðarlausu\" (\"you can get a new phone free of charge\", lit. \"you can get a new phone to you at no cost\").\n\nPassive constructions in Icelandic also require the subject to be in the dative if the verb in question governs the dative, e.g. \"tímaáætluninni var breytt\" (\"the timetable was changed\"), \"skjölunum var eytt\" (\"the documents were deleted\") and \"framkvæmdum var frestað um tvær vikur\" (\"works were delayed by two weeks\"). Compare to passive constructions where the verb governs the accusative: \"búðin var opnuð á föstudaginn\" (\"the shop was opened on Friday\") and \"bréfið var sent fyrir hádegi\" (\"the letter was sent before noon\"). Verbs that govern the genitive behave in the same way as verbs governing the dative, e.g. \"þín verður saknað\" (\"you will be missed\").\n\nFinally, certain verbs require the subject to be in the dative. This is particularly common with verbs of emotion or opinion. For example:\n\nThis phenomenon is not only restricted to the dative case, some verbs require their subject to be in the accusative:\n\nIn all of the above instances, the verbs used in these constructions are in the third-person singular form.\n\nA number of verbs in Spanish employ a dative construction. Many of these verbs express psychological states; the most common one is \"gustar\", which is equivalent to English \"like\" (but syntactically functions like \"be pleasant to\"). The verb agrees with the formal/morphological subject, but the subject is usually placed after the verb instead of before, as usual. The dative construction requires a clitic pronoun; if the dative argument is a full noun phrase or needs to be explicitly stated, it is shown by a phrase with the preposition \"a\".\n\nOther verbs which show this pattern are \"apasionar\" (\"to be passionate about\"), \"antojarse\" (\"to have a feeling for\"), \"encantar\" (\"to adore\"), \"faltar\" (\"to be lacking\"), \"quedar\" (\"to fall\") and \"sobrar\" (\"to be left\").\n\nIn Serbo-Croatian (as in other Slavic languages), the dative construction is often used, mostly in the same manner as in German:\n\nliterally \"I am cold\", meaning \"I am a cold person\".\n\nliterally \"It is cold to me\", meaning \"I am (feeling) cold\".\nSome verbs, like \"nedostajati\" (\"lack\") use dative constructions:\n\nliterally \"Teeth to him lack\".\n\nThe dative construction is very common in Georgian. The dative construction of Georgian differs somewhat from German, in that the dative case agrees with a certain person marking on the verb. The dative construction occurs in the perfect (not perfective) tense of transitive verbs and in all the tenses of some verbs, such as \"to want\", \"to have\", \"to forget\" and \"to remember\". These verbs are also called \"indirect verbs\" by some generativists. Compare:\n\nIn Georgian, the -s suffix is the dative case marker. In the first sentence, \"bavshvebi\" (\"children\") is the subject and in the nominative case. \"Tsqals\" (\"water\") is the object and in the dative case (with the suffix -\"s\" attached). In the second sentence, however, the subject (children) is in the dative case (with -\"s\"), and the object (water) is in the nominative case. The verb in the imperfective and perfective sentences are conjugated in accordance with the subject of the sentence (regardless of the case of the subject); they are both third person plural. Perfect verbs also agree in part with their dative case subjects (in this case the -u- between da- and -leviat), but only have third person verb endings (singular form for all singular persons and ALSO first person plural; plural form for 2nd/3rd person plural). Therefore, \"I have drunk water\" would be:\n\nThe dative construction is also a separate class of verbs (Class IV) which have the semantics of experience, cognitive processes, and possession (all common DAT-construction predicates in languages which have them). An example of this can be given with the possessive verb \"kona\" (\"to have\"):\n\nIn all the tenses, the subject \"kals\" (\"woman\") is in the dative case, and the object \"tsigni\" (\"book\") is in the nominative case. Etymologically, the root is also found in the future forms of the copula 'be', making it very much like the Latin dative possession construction 'mihi est X'. Again, all singular persons have an agreeing proclitic pronoun on the verb, but a third person singular verb ending (-a or -s).\n\nThe genitive case is used in dative constructions. The \"dative genitive\" (\"datiivigenetiivi\") is no longer productive in Finnish language, and it is often replaced with other cases, except in frozen expressions, e.g. \"luojan kiitos\" (thanks to god).\n\nThe dative genitive is often used with verb infinitives.\n\nLatin uses a dative construction for indirect objects (\"dativus possessivus\").\nHungarian uses a similar construction to Latin for rendering possession without the verb \"to have\" which is missing from Hungarian.\n\n"}

He is a two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States' highest civilian award.\n\nBorn and raised in Pittsburgh, McCullough earned a degree in English literature from Yale University. His first book was \"The Johnstown Flood\" (1968); and he has since written nine more on such topics as Harry S. Truman, John Adams, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the Wright brothers. McCullough has also narrated numerous documentaries, such as \"The Civil War\" by Ken Burns, as well as the 2003 film \"Seabiscuit\"; and he hosted \"American Experience\" for twelve years.\n\nMcCullough's two Pulitzer Prize-winning books, \"Truman\" and \"John Adams\", have been adapted by HBO into a TV film and a miniseries, respectively.\n\nMcCullough was born in the Point Breeze neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of Ruth (née Rankin) and Christian Hax McCullough. He is of Scots-Irish descent. He was educated at Linden Avenue Grade School and Shady Side Academy, in his hometown of Pittsburgh. One of four sons, McCullough had a \"marvelous\" childhood with a wide range of interests, including sports and drawing cartoons. McCullough's parents and his grandmother, who read to him often, introduced him to books at an early age. His parents often talked about history, a topic he says should be discussed more often. McCullough \"loved school, every day\"; he contemplated many career choices, ranging from architect, actor, painter, writer, to lawyer, and contemplated attending medical school for a time.\n\nIn 1951, McCullough began attending Yale University. He said that it was a \"privilege\" to study English at Yale because of faculty members such as John O'Hara, John Hersey, Robert Penn Warren, and Brendan Gill. McCullough occasionally ate lunch with the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist and playwright Thornton Wilder. Wilder, says McCullough, taught him that a competent writer maintains \"an air of freedom\" in the storyline, so that a reader will not anticipate the outcome, even if the book is non-fiction.\n\nWhile at Yale, he became a member of Skull and Bones. He served apprenticeships at \"Time\", \"Life\", the United States Information Agency, and \"American Heritage\", where he enjoyed research. \"Once I discovered the endless fascination of doing the research and of doing the writing, I knew I had found what I wanted to do in my life.\" While attending Yale, McCullough studied Arts and earned his bachelor's degree in English, with the intention of becoming a fiction writer or playwright. He graduated with honors in English literature (1955).\n\nAfter graduation, McCullough moved to New York City, where \"Sports Illustrated\" hired him as a trainee. He later worked as an editor and writer for the United States Information Agency in Washington, D.C. After working for twelve years, including a position at \"American Heritage\", in editing and writing, McCullough \"felt that [he] had reached the point where [he] could attempt something on [his] own.\"\n\nMcCullough \"had no anticipation that [he] was going to write history, but [he] stumbled upon a story that [he] thought was powerful, exciting, and very worth telling.\" While working at \"American Heritage\", McCullough wrote in his spare time for three years. \"The Johnstown Flood\", a chronicle of one of the worst flood disasters in United States history, was published in 1968 to high praise by critics. John Leonard, of \"The New York Times\", said of McCullough, \"We have no better social historian.\" Despite rough financial times, he decided to become a full-time writer, encouraged by his wife Rosalee.\n\nAfter the success of \"The Johnstown Flood\", two new publishers offered him contracts, one to write about the Great Chicago Fire and another about the San Francisco earthquake. Simon & Schuster, publisher of his first book, also offered McCullough a contract to write a second book. Trying not to become \"Bad News McCullough\", he decided to write about a subject showing \"people were not always foolish and inept or irresponsible.\" He remembered the words of his Yale teacher: \"[Thornton] Wilder said he got the idea for a book or a play when he wanted to learn about something. Then, he'd check to see if anybody had already done it, and if they hadn't, he'd do it.\" McCullough decided to write a history of the Brooklyn Bridge, which he had walked across many times.\n\nTo me history ought to be a source of pleasure. It isn't just part of our civic responsibility. To me it's an enlargement of the experience of being alive, just the way literature or art or music is. – David McCullough\n\nHe also proposed, from a suggestion by his editor, a work about the Panama Canal; both were accepted by the publisher. Critics hailed \"The Great Bridge\" (1972) as \"the definitive book on the event.\"\n\nFive years later, \"The Path Between the Seas: The Creation of the Panama Canal\" was released, gaining McCullough widespread recognition. The book won the National Book Award in History, the Samuel Eliot Morison Award, the Francis Parkman Prize, and the Cornelius Ryan Award. Later in 1977, McCullough travelled to the White House to advise Jimmy Carter and the United States Senate on the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, which would give Panama control of the Canal. Carter later said that the treaties, which were agreed upon to hand over ownership of the Canal to Panama, would not have passed had it not been for the book.\n\nMcCullough's fourth work was his first biography, reinforcing his belief that \"history is the story of people\". Released in 1981, \"Mornings on Horseback\" tells the story of seventeen years in the life of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th President of the United States. The work ranged from 1869, when Roosevelt was ten years old, to 1886, and tells of a \"life intensely lived.\" The book won McCullough's second National Book Award and his first \"Los Angeles Times\" Prize for Biography and New York Public Library Literary Lion Award. \nNext, he published \"Brave Companions\", a collection of essays that \"unfold seamlessly\". Written over twenty years, the book includes essays about Louis Agassiz, Alexander von Humboldt, John and Washington Roebling, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Conrad Richter, and Frederic Remington.\n\nWith his next book, McCullough published his second biography, \"Truman\" (1993) about the 33rd president. The book won McCullough his first Pulitzer Prize, in the category of \"Best Biography or Autobiography,\" and his second Francis Parkman Prize. Two years later, the book was adapted as \"Truman\" (1995), a television film by HBO, starring Gary Sinise as Truman.\n\nI think it's important to remember that these men are not perfect. If they were marble gods, what they did wouldn't be so admirable. The more we see the founders as humans the more we can understand them. – David McCullough\nWorking for the next seven years, McCullough published \"John Adams\" (2001), his third biography about a United States president. One of the fastest-selling non-fiction books in history, the book won McCullough's second Pulitzer Prize for \"Best Biography or Autobiography.\" He started it as a book about the founding fathers and back-to-back presidents John Adams and Thomas Jefferson; but dropped Jefferson to focus on Adams. HBO adapted \"John Adams\" as a seven-part miniseries by the same name. Premiering in 2008, it starred Paul Giamatti in the title role. The DVD version of the miniseries includes the biographical documentary, \"David McCullough: Painting with Words\".\n\nMcCullough's \"1776\", tells the story of the founding year of the United States, focusing on George Washington, the amateur army, and other struggles for independence. Because of McCullough's popularity, its initial printing was 1.25 million copies, many more than the average history book. Upon its release, the book was a number one best-seller in the United States. A miniseries adaptation of \"1776\" was rumored.\n\nMcCullough considered writing a sequel to \"1776\". However, he signed a contract with Simon & Schuster to do a work about Americans in Paris between 1830 and 1900, \"The Greater Journey\", which was published in 2011. The book covers 19th-century Americans, including Mark Twain and Samuel Morse, who migrated to Paris and went on to achieve importance in culture or innovation. Other subjects include Benjamin Silliman, who had been Morse's science teacher at Yale, Elihu Washburne, the American ambassador to France during the Franco-Prussian War, and Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in the United States.\n\nIn 2015, McCullough's \"The Wright Brothers\" was published. On October 6, 2016, Simon & Schuster announced that they will publish David McCullough's new book, \"The Pioneers\", in 2019. \"The Pioneers\" is the story of the first European American settlers of the Northwest Territory, a vast American wilderness to which the Ohio River was the gateway.\n\nDavid McCullough lives in Boston and is married to Rosalee Barnes McCullough, whom he met at age 17 in Pittsburgh. The couple have five children and nineteen grandchildren. He enjoys sports, history, and art, including watercolor and portrait painting.\n\nHis son, David Jr., an English teacher at Wellesley High School in the Boston suburbs, achieved sudden fame in 2012 with his commencement speech. He told graduating students, \"you're not special\" nine times, and his speech went viral on YouTube. His son is married to the daughter of former Florida governor Bob Graham.\nA registered independent, McCullough has typically avoided publicly commenting on contemporary political issues. When asked to do so, he would repeatedly say, \"My specialty is dead politicians.\" During the 2016 presidential election season, he broke with this tradition to criticize Donald Trump, whom he called \"a monstrous clown with a monstrous ego.\"\n\nMcCullough has received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in December 2006, the highest civilian award that a United States citizen can receive.\nIn 1995 the National Book Foundation conferred its lifetime Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.\nMcCullough has been awarded more than 40 honorary degrees, including one from the Eastern Nazarene College in John Adams' hometown of Quincy, Massachusetts. \nMcCullough has received two Pulitzer Prizes, two National Book Awards, two Francis Parkman Prizes, the \"Los Angeles Times\" Book Award, New York Public Library's Literary Lion Award, and the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates, among others. McCullough was chosen to deliver the first annual John Hersey Lecture at Yale University on March 22, 1993. He is a member of the John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship and the Academy of Achievement. In 2003, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected McCullough for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. McCullough's lecture was entitled \"The Course of Human Events\".\n\nIn 1995, McCullough received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. The Helmerich Award is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust.\n\nMcCullough has been called a \"master of the art of narrative history.\" \"The New York Times\" critic John Leonard wrote that McCullough was \"incapable of writing a page of bad prose.\" His works have been published in ten languages, over nine million copies have been printed, and all of his books are still in print.\n\nIn December, 2012, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania announced that it would rename the 16th Street Bridge in Pittsburgh in honor of McCullough.\n\nIn a ceremony at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, on November 16, 2015, the Air University of the United States Air Force awarded McCullough an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters degree. He was also made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Yale University in 2015.\n\nOn May 11, 2016, McCullough received the United States Capitol Historical Society's Freedom Award. It was presented in the National Statuary Hall.\n\nIn September 2016, McCullough received the Gerry Lenfest Spirit of the American Revolution Award from the Museum of the American Revolution.\n\nMcCullough has narrated many television shows and documentaries throughout his career. In addition to narrating the 2003 film \"Seabiscuit\", McCullough hosted PBS<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"American Experience\" from 1988 to 1999. McCullough has narrated numerous documentaries directed by Ken Burns, including the Emmy Award-winning \"The Civil War\", the Academy Award-nominated \"Brooklyn Bridge\", \"The Statue of Liberty\", and \"The Congress\". He served as a guest narrator for The Most Wonderful Time of the Year, a Mormon Tabernacle Choir Christmas concert special that aired on PBS in 2010.\n\nMcCullough has narrated some of his own audiobooks, including introductions for the anniversary edition of \"The Great Bridge\" and \"The Greater Journey\" and the entire audiobooks of \"1776\" and \"The Wright Brothers\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7942", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7942", "title": "Disbarment", "text": "Disbarment\n\nDisbarment is the removal of a lawyer from a bar association or the practice of law, thus revoking his or her law license or admission to practice law. Disbarment is usually a punishment for unethical or criminal conduct. Procedures vary depending on the law society.\n\nIn Germany, the \"Berufsverbot\" is a ban on practicing a profession, which can be issued to a lawyer for misconduct, \"Volksverhetzung\" or for serious mismanagement of personal finances.\n\nIn April 1933, the Nazi government issued a \"Berufsverbot\" forbidding the practice of law by Jews, communists, and other political opponents, except for those protected by the Frontkämpferprivileg.\n\nGenerally disbarment is imposed as a sanction for conduct indicating that an attorney is not fit to practice law, willfully disregarding the interests of a client, commingling funds, or engaging in fraud which impedes the administration of justice. In addition, any lawyer who is convicted of a felony is automatically disbarred in most jurisdictions, a policy that, although opposed by the American Bar Association, has been described as a convicted felon's just deserts.\n\nIn the United States legal system, disbarment is specific to regions; one can be disbarred from some courts, while still being a member of the bar in another jurisdiction. However, under the American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which have been adopted in most states, disbarment in one state or court is grounds for disbarment in a jurisdiction which has adopted the Model Rules.\n\nDisbarment is quite rare (in 2011, only 1,046 lawyers were disbarred). Instead, lawyers are usually sanctioned by their own clients through civil malpractice proceedings, or via fine, censure, suspension, or other punishments from the disciplinary boards. To be disbarred is considered a great embarrassment and shame, even if one no longer wishes to pursue a career in the law.\n\nBecause disbarment rules vary by area, different rules can apply depending on where a lawyer is disbarred. Notably, the majority of US states have no procedure for permanently disbarring a person. Depending on the jurisdiction, a lawyer may reapply to the bar immediately, after five to seven years, or be banned for life.\n\nThe 20th and the 21st centuries have seen one former U.S. president and one former U.S. vice president disbarred, and another president suspended from one bar and caused to resign from another bar rather than face disbarment.\n\nFormer Vice President Spiro Agnew, having pleaded no contest (which subjects a person to the same criminal penalties as a guilty plea, but is not an admission of guilt for a civil suit) to charges of bribery and tax evasion, was disbarred from Maryland, the state of which he had previously been governor.\n\nFormer President Richard Nixon was disbarred from New York in 1976. for obstruction of justice related to the Watergate scandal. He had attempted to resign from the New York bar, as he had done with California and the Supreme Court, but his resignation was not accepted as he would not acknowledge that he was unable to defend himself from the charges brought against him.\n\nIn 2001, following a 5-year suspension by the Arkansas bar, the United States Supreme Court disbarred Bill Clinton, providing 40 days for him to contest the action. He resigned before the end of the 40 day period, avoiding permanent disbarment hearings.\n\nAlger Hiss was disbarred for a felony conviction, but later became the first person reinstated to the bar in Massachusetts after disbarment.\n\nIn 2007, Mike Nifong, the District Attorney of Durham County, North Carolina who presided over the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, was disbarred for prosecutorial misconduct related to his handling of the case.\n\nIn April 2012, a three-member panel appointed by the Arizona Supreme Court voted unanimously to disbar Andrew Thomas, former County Attorney of Maricopa County, Arizona, and a former close confederate of Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. According to the panel, Thomas \"outrageously exploited power, flagrantly fostered fear, and disgracefully misused the law\" while serving as Maricopa County Attorney. The panel found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that Thomas brought unfounded and malicious criminal and civil charges against political opponents, including four state judges and the state attorney general. \"Were this a criminal case,\" the panel concluded, \"we are confident that the evidence would establish this conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\nJack Thompson, the Florida lawyer noted for his activism against video games, rap music, and Howard Stern was permanently disbarred for various charges of misconduct. The action was the result of several grievances claiming that Thompson had made defamatory, false statements and attempted to humiliate, embarrass, harass or intimidate his opponents. The order was made on September 25, 2008, effective October 25. However, Thompson attempted to appeal to the higher courts in order to avoid the penalty actually taking effect. Neither the US District court, nor the US Supreme Court would hear his appeal, rendering the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court final.\n\nEd Fagan, a New York lawyer who prominently represented Holocaust victims against Swiss banks, was disbarred in New York (in 2008) and New Jersey (in 2009) for failing to pay court fines and fees; and for misappropriating client and escrow trust funds.\n\nF. Lee Bailey, noted criminal defense attorney, was disbarred by the state of Florida in 2001, with reciprocal disbarment in Massachusetts in 2002. The Florida disbarment was the result of his handling of stock in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey was found guilty of 7 counts of attorney misconduct by the Florida Supreme Court. Bailey had transferred a large portion of DuBoc's assets into his own accounts, using the interest gained on those assets to pay for personal expenses. In March 2005, Bailey filed to regain his law license in Massachusetts. The book \"Florida Pulp Nonfiction\" details the peculiar facts of the DuBoc case along with extended interviews with Bailey that include his own defense. Bailey is also best known for infamously representing murder suspect O. J. Simpson in 1994.\n"}

He ordered the execution of all Nader's sons and grandsons, with the exception of the 13-year-old Shahrokh, the son of Reza Qoli. Meanwhile, Nader's former treasurer, Ahmad Shah Abdali, had declared his independence by founding the Durrani Empire. In the process, the eastern territories were lost and in the following decades became part of Afghanistan, the successor-state to the Durrani Empire. The Ottomans regained lost territories in Eastern Anatolia and Mesopotamia. The northern territories, Iran's most integral regions, had a different fate. Erekle II and Teimuraz II, who, in 1744, had been made the kings of Kakheti and Kartli respectively by Nader himself for their loyal service, capitalized on the eruption of instability, and declared \"de facto\" independence. Erekle II assumed control over Kartli after Teimuraz II's death, thus unifying the two as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler in three centuries to preside over a politically unified eastern Georgia. Due to the frantic turn of events in mainland Iran he would be able to remain \"de facto\" autonomous through the Zand period. Under the successive Qajar dynasty, Iran managed to restore Iranian suzerainty over the Georgian regions, until they would be irrevocably lost in the course of the 19th century, to neighbouring Imperial Russia. Meanwhile, Azad Khan Afghan (who was a member of Nader Shah's army and participated in the Indian campaign) managed to take control over the land between the Aras river, and the Urmia Lake by 1750. Azad Khan would later go on to capture Isfahan and occupy Shiraz, before losing all his territories by 1758 to Karim Khan. Meanwhile, the Absheron Peninsula and surrounding territories, were under the control of the Khanate of Baku, while the Avar Khanate took control over modern day Dagestan. Alongside eastern Georgia, these territories would all be re-incorporated into Iran but eventually permanently and irrevocably lost as well in the course of the 19th century, through the two Russo-Persian Wars of the century, to neighbouring Imperial Russia. Lastly, Oman and the Uzbek khanates of Bukhara and Khiva regained independence.\nThe Afsharid dynasty would continue to live on in parts of Khorasan with Mashhad as the capital. When the Zand empire expanded rapidly, Karim khan allowed the Afsharids to continue rule in Khorasan, showing his respect for Nader Shah. It was eventually dissolved upon the Qajars ascension to the throne.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20794754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20794754", "title": "Echo answer", "text": "Echo answer\n\nIn linguistics, an echo answer or echo response is a way of answering a polar question without using words for yes and no. The verb used in the question is simply echoed in the answer, negated if the answer has a negative truth-value. For example:\n\nThe Finnish language is one language that employs echo answers in response to yes-no questions. It does not answer them with either adverbs or interjections. So the answer to \"Tuletteko kaupungista?\" (\"Are you coming from town?\") is the verb form itself, \"Tulemme\" (\"We are coming.\"). Negatively phrased questions are answered similarly. Negative answers use the negative verb \"en\" in coordination with the infinitive. The negative answer to \"Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?\" (\"Do you know Mr Lehto?\") is \"En tunne\" (\"I don't know.\") or simply \"En\" (\"I don't.\").\n\nThe Celtic languages also primarily employ echo answers. Irish and Scottish Gaelic lack the words \"yes\" and \"no\" altogether. In Welsh, the words for \"yes\" and \"no\" (\"ie\" and \"nage\") are restricted to specialized circumstances. Like Finnish, the main way in these languages to state yes or no, to answer yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. In Irish, the question \"An dtiocfaidh tú?\" (\"Will you come?\") will be answered with \"Tiocfad\" (\"I will come\") or \"Ní thiocfad\" (\"I will not come\"). (In Hiberno-English, it is the auxiliary that is echoed: the English question \"Will you come?\" is often answered in Ireland with \"I will\" instead of \"Yes\" or \"I will not\" instead of \"no\".)\n\nSimilarly, in Welsh, the answers to \"Ydy Fred yn dod?\" (\"Is Fred coming?\") are \"Ydy\" (\"He is\") or \"Nag ydy\" (\"He is not\"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with \"nag\". As in Finnish, it avoids the issue of what an unadorned \"yes\" means in response to a negative question. A \"yes\" response to the question \"You don't beat your wife?\" is ambiguous in English, but the Welsh response \"nag ydw\" has no ambiguity.\n\nLatin, which has no single words for \"yes\" and \"no\", also employs echo answers:\n\nThe Portuguese language is the only major Romance language to use echo answers often even though it has words for \"yes\" and \"no\" proper (\"sim\" and \"não\" respectively) as well. Portuguese will most commonly answer a polar question in the affirmative by repeating the main verb.\n\nFor example, one would answer the question, \"Tens fome?\" (\"Are you hungry?\" literally, \"Do you have hunger?\") by simply replying, \"tenho\" (\"I have\"). One could also add \"sim\" before or after the verb for the use of emphasis or to contradict a negative question, producing \"sim, tenho\" or \"tenho sim\". To produce a \"negative\" answer to a polar question, the verb is repeated followed by \"não\" before or after it. Thus, a negative answer to our above question would be: \"Não tenho,\" \"Tenho não\" or \"Não tenho fome.\" For emphasis, one could even say, \"Não tenho, não.\"\n\nThe Chinese languages often employs echo answers. Often, yes-no questions in Mandarin are expressed in the A-not-A form, and are answered with either A or not-A. \nFor example, where Q stands for question, A for affirmative, and N for negative:\n\nQ: 你要不要吃桔子？ \"Nǐ yào bú yào chī júzi?\" (\"You want or not want eat orange?\")\n\nA: 要。 \"Yào.\" (\"Want.\")\n\nN: 不要。 \"Bú yào.\" (\"Not want.\")\n\nQ: 他在不在慢跑？ \"Tā zài bú zài màn pǎo?\" (\"He is or not jog?\")\n\nA: 在（慢跑）。 \"zài （màn pǎo).\" (\"Is (jog).\")\n\nN: 不在（慢跑）。 \"Bu zài （màn pǎo)\" (\"Not is (jog).\")\n\nIn addition, yes-no questions are often formed by adding the particle \"吗\" (\"ma\" for \"yes or no?\") to the end of a sentence, in which case the answer can be \"是的\" (\"shì de\" for \"is (so)\") or \"不是\" (\"bu shì\" for \"not is (so)\"), or \"对\" (\"duì\" for \"right\") or \"不对\" (\"bu duì\" for \"not right\"):\n\nQ: 你不上课吗？ \"Nǐ bu shàng kè ma?\" (\"You not go-to class yes-or-no?\")\n\nA: 对。 \"Duì.\" (\"Right.\") or 是的。 \"Shì de.\" (\"Is (so).\")\n\nN: 不对。 \"Bu duì.\" (\"Not right.\") or 不是。 \"Bu shì. (\"Not is (so).\")\n"}

The three types of egressive sounds are pulmonic egressive (from the lungs), glottalic egressive (from the glottis), and lingual (velaric) egressive (from the tongue). The opposite of an egressive sound is an ingressive sound, in which the airstream flows inward through the mouth or nose.\n\nPulmonic egressive sounds are those in which the air stream is created by the lungs, ribs, and diaphragm. The majority of sounds in most languages, such as vowels, are both pulmonic and egressive. Pulmonic egressive sounds are found in all spoken languages.\n\nGlottalic egressive sounds are known as ejectives.\n\nThe lingual egressive, also known as velaric egressive, involves a double closure similar to that of the lingual ingressive sounds known as clicks, but with airflow in the opposite direction. With the velum closed, the speaker forces air out of the mouth using either the tongue or cheeks, as in the French expression of dismissal. While not known to be used for normal vocabulary in any human language, apart from the extinct Australian ritual language Damin, a variation of this airstream mechanism is known to musicians as part of circular breathing.\n\n"}

He is widely regarded as one of the primary founders of the modern field of sociology of law.\n\nEhrlich was born in Chernivtsi (now Chernivtsi) in the Duchy of Bukovina, at that time a province of the Austro-Hungarian empire. Ehrlich studied law in Vienna, where he taught and practised as a lawyer before returning to Czernowitz to teach at the university there, a bastion of Germanic culture at the eastern edge of the Empire.\n\nEhrlich remained there for the rest of his teaching career and was Rector of the University in 1906–7. During the turmoil of World War I, when Czernowitz was occupied several times by Russian forces, he moved to Switzerland. After the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the ceding of the Bukovina to Romania, Ehrlich planned to return to Czernowitz, where he would have been required to teach in Romanian, but he died of diabetes in Vienna, Austria in 1922.\n\nEhrlich's experience of the Bukovina's legal culture, where Austrian law and sharply contrasting local custom seemed to co-exist, caused him to question the hierarchical notions of law propounded by such theorists as Hans Kelsen. Ehrlich noted that legal theories that recognized law only as a sum of statutes and court decisions gave an inadequate view of the legal reality of a community. He drew a distinction between norms for decision and social norms or norms of conduct. The latter actually govern the life of a society and, under certain conditions, can justifiably be regarded in popular consciousness, if not necessarily by lawyers, as law. For example, commercial usage and custom may develop and be recognized and respected by courts of law and other agencies as having normative force and legal significance.\n\nEhrlich claimed that the \"living law\" that regulates social life may be very different from the norms for decision applied by courts, and may sometimes attract far greater cultural authority which lawyers cannot safely ignore. Norms for decision regulate only those disputes that are brought before a judicial or other tribunal. Living law is a framework for the routine structuring of social relationships. Its source is in the many different kinds of social associations in which people co-exist. Its essence is not dispute and litigation, but peace and co-operation. What counts as law depends on what kind of authority exists to give it legal significance among those it is supposed to regulate.\n\nEhrlich's teaching is that the sources of law's authority are plural and insofar as some of those sources are political and others cultural they may conflict. But not all the norms of social associations should be thought of as 'law', in Ehrlich's view. Legal norms (understood sociologically, rather than juristically) are typically distinguished from merely moral or customary ones by powerful feelings of revulsion which typically attach to breach of them. They are, thus, regarded as socially fundamental. In addition, legal norms concern certain kinds of relationships, transactions and circumstances which he described as 'facts of the law'—specially important topics or considerations for social regulation.\n\n\n"}

Feminist Digital Humanities has risen partly due to recent criticism of the propensity of Digital Humanities to further patriarchal or hegemonic discourses in the Academy. Some of the research in feminist digital humanities centres on the exclusion of women from histories of technology and the use of technology to promote feminist scholarship. Feminist Digital Humanities emphasizes the role of women, feminists, and cyberfeminists in technology, overturning ideas such as “Men invented the Internet”, as written in a June 2012 New York Times article.\n\nA list of women in the digital humanities begun by Jacqueline Wernimont makes available a compendium of women working in the field.\n\nMedia Theorist Lisa Nakamura notes that \"[as] women of color acquire an increasing presence online, their particular interests which spring directly from gender and racial identifications, that is to say, those identities associated with a physical body off-line, are being addressed.\" Likewise, Science and Technology Studies professor Donna Haraway has also pioneered specifically feminist approaches to the study of digital humanities.\n\nThis intervention is notably crystallized in the work of FemTechNet, \"an activated network of scholars, artists, and students who work on, with, and at the borders of technology, science and feminism in a variety of fields including STS, Media and Visual Studies, Art, Women’s, Queer, and Ethnic Studies\". FemTechNet has collaborated on a number of projects that reflect the aims of Feminist Digital Humanities, including Wikistorming, DOCC: Distributed Open Collaborative Course, and video dialogues. Their methods emphasize distribution through networks to connect diverse institutions, nations, and fields.\n\nProfessors of Digital Humanities, Bethany Nowviskie and Miriam Posner have blogged about the structures in place that have kept women from engaging in digital humanities. There have been efforts to increase the racial representations within the field as well. These feminist digital humanities projects include #transformDH, That Camp Theory, Critical Code Studies, and Crunk Feminist Collective. Black Girls Code is a project that has recently garnered attention, with founder Kimberly Bryant receiving a Standing O-vation presented by Toyota and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nOne goal of feminist literary scholars has been to increase the scope of women's literary works in visible archives. The Orlando Project and The Women Writers Project are two early projects that undertook the task of filling in the gaps that existed in literary history in the 1980s. Both efforts sought to use the electronic format \"to overcome the problems of inaccessibility and scarcity which had rendered women’s writing invisible for so long.\"\nOne critique of a content-oriented approach to combating the marginalization of women's literary works is that it's simply not enough to add content to a system that is built upon a patriarchal methodology. \"Literary scholars who depend on archival or rare book materials still confront, whether they acknowledge it or not, the legacy of an institutional form through which patriarchal power exercised the authority to determine value, classification, and access.\"\n\n"}

Belinda A. Aquino, former director of the Center for Philippine Studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, defines Philippine Studies as \"studies of Philippine culture and society, (which) started in the early 1900s when the Philippines became a colony of the United States. It encompasses the study of Filipino history, Filipino culture, Philippine languages, Filipino society, Filipino life, Filipino psyche or Filipino psychology, Filipino politics, and Filipino government. The approaches or perspectives of Philippine Studies could be theoretical, interdisciplinary, comparative, transnational, and global. Filipinology was developed in the University of the Philippines Diliman and had become part of curricula in some colleges and universities inside and outside the Philippines.\n\nLearning goals of Filipinology include the comprehension, appreciation, and critical evaluation of the Philippines through Philippine History, contemporary issues in Philippine community, and Philippine Humanities such as Filipino philosophy, Filipino music, Filipino art, Philippine literature, and Philippine dance. The incorporation of Philippine Humanities through literary readings, listening to musical recordings, film viewings, and field trips provide development of cultural acceptance and aesthetic sense. Philippine Studies extend to connecting contributions of persons of Filipino descent to new settings and culture (such as Overseas Filipinos to other countries). Apart from providing education and awareness about the Philippines, Filipinology aims to make students of Philippine Studies aware of Filipino ethnic identity by experiencing Philippine culture.\n\nExperts on Filipinology are called filipinologists (Spanish: \"Filipinologista\") (Filipino: \"Pilipinolohista\"; literally “experts in Filipino culture”). According to Rosa M. Vallejo the \"foremost\" non-Filipino filipinologist is the Spaniard bibliographer Wenceslao Emilio Retana y Gamboa. Other prominent non-Filipino filipinologists are William Henry Scott, H. Brett Melendy Ferdinand Blumentritt, and A.V. Hartendorp.\nAmong the prominent Russian filipinologists are Vladimir Makarenko and Podberezsky.\n\nPublications dealing with Filipinology seek to reach specialist and non-specialist audience from and outside the Philippines. Among such Philippine Studies literature is the quarterly journal \"\" published by the Ateneo de Manila University. Founded in 1953, the journal serves as a “forum” for disseminating many aspects of life in the Philippines through research in history, humanities and social sciences, “friendly and constructive debate”, and the expression of scholarly views. Another publication is the book written by Remigio E. Agpalo entitled \"Adventures in Political Science\". With an introduction written by Zeus A. Salazar, Agpalo’s book is a “major contribution” to Filipinology that covers important areas of political science in the Philippines, including political dynamics, comparative government, comparative politics, Philippine government, Philippine politics, political philosophy, political theory, political methodology, constitutional law, modernization and political development.\n\n\n"}

P. Singhal, Indians in ancient times did not neglect the discipline of historiography.\n\nAccording to Peter Hardy, Muslim historiography on medieval India is often motivated by Islamic apologetics, which tries to justify \"the life of medieval Muslims to the modern world\". There is a shortage of historical works by Hindus before the Muslim conquest. D.P. Singhal says that contrary to the popular belief, Indians did not neglect historiography. James Tod said that Muslim invaders and rulers destroyed much Hindu, Jain and Buddhist literature, including historical works.\n\nAccording to James Mill's influential 'The History of British India' (1817), a scholarship of proper historiography was never developed in Ancient India. This theory was widely accepted and created a sense of 'tabula rasa'. Indian nationalists like Bankim Chandra Chatterjee (1838–1894) advocated the writing of a ‘truly Indian historiography of India’.\n\nIn post-Indepence India, a historiography based on a Marxist interpretation of history was very influential. The historians belonging to the Marxist Phase adopted a materialistic interpretation of history and focused on the study of the effects of social and economic factors on history. In India, D. D. Kosambi is considered the founding father of Marxist historiography. The senior-most scholars of Marxist historiography are R. S. Sharma, Irfan Habib, D. N. Jha and K. N. Panikkar.\n\nOne debate in Indian history that relates to a historical materialist schema is on the nature of feudalism in India. D. D. Kosambi in the 1960s outlined the idea of \"feudalism from below\" and \"feudalism from above\", with which R. S. Sharma largely agrees. Such Marxist historians argue that the economic origins of communalism are feudal remnants and the economic insecurities caused by slow development under a \"world capitalist system.\"\n\nB. R. Ambedkar criticised Marxists, as he deemed them to be unaware or ignorant of the specifics of caste issues. A number of historians have also debated Marxist historians and critically examined their analysis of history of India. One critique is Arun Shourie's \"Eminent Historians\" (1998), which does not identify any scholarly shortcomings but only minor inefficiencies and bureaucratic corruption.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Hindu nationalist scholars especially have polemicised against the Marxist tradition in India for neglecting what they believe to be the country's 'illustrious past.' Marxists are held responsible by the Indian right-wing for aiding or defending Muslims, who are considered as 'enemies within' or 'internal threats' by Hindutva ideologues.\n\nIn the last two decades of the twentieth century, the subaltern historiography was developed. By highlighting the struggles of the workers and the peasants, this historiography has challenged not only conventional historiography but even Marxist historiography.\n\n\n"}

It comprises a total area of and a length of about , of which are natural borders by bodies of water and the Argentine and Brazilian sides together comprise around . Iguaçu National Park was created by federal decree nr. 1035 of January 10, 1939, and became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. The park is managed by Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio).\n\nThe park shares with Iguazú National Park in Argentina one of the world's largest waterfalls, extending over some . It is home to many rare and endangered species of flora and fauna, among them the giant otter and the giant anteater. The clouds of spray produced by the waterfall are conducive to the growth of lush vegetation.\n\nThe Iguaçu National Park owes its name to the fact it includes an important area of the Iguazu River (Portuguese: Rio Iguaçu). Approximately of the length of the river makes up the Iguaçu Falls.\n\nIt is the most important park of the Prata Basin and, since it is a haven to a significant genetic asset of animal and vegetal species, it was the first park in Brazil to receive a Management Plan. As foreseen by Rebouças, the park's basic goal is the preservation of the highly relevant ecologically and scenic natural ecosystems, thus enabling scientific research and the development of environmental education and interpretation activities, recreation in natural surroundings and the ecological tourism.\n\nThe Iguaçu National Park is spectacular as well as pioneering. The first proposal for a Brazilian national park aimed at providing a pristine environment to \"future generations\", just as \"it had been created by God\" and endowed with \"all possible preservation, from the beautiful to the sublime, from the picturesque to the awesome\" and \"an unmatched flora\" located in the \"magnificent Iguaçu waterfalls\". These were the words used by André Rebouças, an engineer, in his book \"Provinces of Paraná, Railways to Mato Grosso and Bolivia\", which started up the campaign aimed at preserving the Iguaçu Falls way back in 1876, when Yellowstone National Park, the first national park on the planet, was four years old.\n\nOn November 17, 1986, during the UNESCO conference held in Paris, the Iguaçu National Park was listed as Natural Heritage of Humanity and is one of the largest forest preservation areas in South America.\n\nIn Brazil the Park has boundaries with the following municipalities: Foz do Iguaçu, Medianeira, Matelândia, Céu Azul, São Miguel do Iguaçu, Santa Terezinha de Itaipu, Santa Tereza do Oeste, Capitão Leônidas Marque, Capanema and Serranópolis.\n\nThe Park is located in the westernmost region of the state of Paraná, in the Iguaçú river basin, from downtown Foz do Iguaçú. It borders Argentina, where the Iguazu National Park, which was implemented in 1934, is located. The border between the two countries and their national parks is made by the Iguaçú river, whose source is near the Serra (mountain range) do Mar near Curitiba and runs for throughout the state of Paraná. The river estuary is located 18 km downriver from the Falls, where it flows into the Paraná river. This meeting of rivers forms the triple Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay border.\n\nFishing regulations were published on 2 October 2008, covering conservation areas and their buffer zones in the Paraná River basin.\nThey were the Morro do Diabo State Park, Rio do Peixe State Park, Aguapeí State Park, Mico Leão Preto Ecological Station, Ivinhema State Park, Ilha Grande National Park, Caiuá Ecological Station and Iguaçu National Park. The Santa Maria Ecological Corridor connects the Iguaçu National Park with the protected margins of Lake Itaipu, and via these margins with the Ilha Grande National Park.\nThe park would be part of the proposed Trinational Biodiversity Corridor, which aims to provide forest connections between conservation units in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina in the Upper Paraná ecoregion.\nThe area of the park open for visitation and where the concession areas of Cataratas do Iguaçú S/A are located, accounts for approximately 0.3% of the total area of the park.\n\nThe most spectacular sightseeing of the park is the Iguaçú Falls, which form a 2,700m wide semicircle, while the water falls from a height of . The number of waterfalls ranges from 150 and 300 depending on the Iguaçú river flow. Besides the exuberant waterfalls, there are other attractions such as rich fauna, the Poço Preto (the Black Well), the Macuco Waterfall, the Visitors Center, the Santos Dumont Statue, a homage paid by VASP (a defunct airline company) to the \"Father of Aviation\", who lent all his prestige and efforts in turning the falls area into a National Park. The park received 1,550,700 visitors (2014)\n\n\n\n"}

Beginning in 1973, Starr wrote nine books on the history of California during his career, along with being professor or visiting lecturer at numerous California universities.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2004 Starr was California's State Librarian. He continued writing California history throughout his career, receiving a Guggenheim Fellowship, membership in the Society of American Historians, and the Gold Medal of the Commonwealth Club of California. In 2006 he was presented a National Humanities Medal from President George W. Bush for his work as a scholar and historian, and in 2010 was inducted into the California Hall of Fame.\n\nKevin Starr was born on Sept. 3, 1940, in San Francisco, to Owen Starr, a machinist, and Marian Starr (née Collins) a bank teller. He was a seventh generation Californian.\n\nStarr's parents divorced when he was a child. When he was six his mother had a nervous breakdown, after which Starr and his younger brother, James, were placed in a Roman Catholic orphanage in Ukiah. Five years later, he and his brother were reunited with their mother, where they lived in a public housing project in San Francisco, while they subsisted on welfare. He attended St. Boniface School in the Tenderloin neighborhood. \n\nHe later enrolled in the University of San Francisco, a Jesuit institution, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1962. At the school, he was editor of \"The Foghorn,\" the school newspaper. After graduation he served for two years as a lieutenant in a tank battalion in Germany (the 68th Armored Brigade of the U.S. Army, in what was then West Germany). Upon release from the service Starr entered Harvard University, earning an MA degree in 1965, a PhD in American Literature in 1969. He subsequently launched his teaching career at Harvard as Assistant (and later Associate) Professor of American Literature from 1969 to 1973, and soon thereafter re-established his life in California.\n\nAfter returning to California in 1973, he became an aide and speechwriter to Mayor Joseph Alioto. He was also appointed city librarian, during which time he earned a master's degree in library science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1974. He also did post-doctoral work at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley.\n\nBeginning in 1973, Starr wrote nine books on the history of California, six of which are part of his Americans and the California Dream series. It was at Harvard that he first became inspired to write about California's history, after browsing through their collection of books about California and the Pacific Coast. He explained the impact those books had on him:\nFrom 1974 to 1989 he was professor or visiting lecturer at numerous California universities, including UC Berkeley, University of Southern California, UC Davis, UC Riverside, Santa Clara University, the University of San Francisco, and Stanford University. He was also a columnist for the San Francisco Examiner.\n\nIn 1989 Starr became Professor of Urban and Regional Planning at the University of Southern California, and was promoted to University Professor of History in 1998.\nStarr sometimes taught at the USC State Capital Center in Sacramento, California.\n\nStarr was appointed by Governor Pete Wilson to serve as California's State Librarian, a post he managed from 1994 to 2004, at which time Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger named him State Librarian Emeritus. Starr oversaw the allocation of $350 million in local library construction money after voters approved a statewide library borrowing measure in 2000. As a child, Starr had to read the newspaper to his visually impaired father, an experience which led him to create a statewide service that allowed visually impaired people to call a phone number to connect with someone who would read the news to them.\n\nCalifornia State Librarian Greg Lucas calls Starr \"truly, one of a kind. No other historian has been able to capture California’s exceptionalism, its vitality and its promise in such detail and yet invest it with the immediacy and excitement of a page-turner novel.\" Starr's library assistant, Mattie Taormina, notes that \"Starr made you excited to be a Californian because you were going to create the future California.\"\n\nStarr is the author of the ongoing multi-volume history of California collectively entitled \"Americans and the California Dream\". The first volume in the series, \"Americans and the California Dream, 1850–1915\" was published in 1973. His most recent volume, which covers the period from 1950 to 1963, entitled \"Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance\" won the 2009 Los Angeles Times Book Prize for history.\n\nHis writing has won him a Guggenheim Fellowship, membership in the Society of American Historians, and the Gold Medal of the Commonwealth Club of California.\n\nIn 2006, Starr was made a member of the College of Fellows of the Dominican School of Philosophy and Theology in Berkeley, California. In 2006 he was presented a National Humanities Medal from President George W. Bush for his work as a scholar and historian. And in 2010, Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver inducted Starr into the California Hall of Fame.\n\nComposer John Adams was inspired by the \"Dream\" series of books to write the piece \"City Noir\" in 2009. Starr received The Robert Kirsch Award by the \"Los Angeles Times\" as part of the 2012 Los Angeles Times Book Prizes.\n\nStarr died of a heart attack in San Francisco on January 14, 2017. In addition to his wife, he is survived by their two daughters, Jessica Starr and Marian Starr Imperatore, and seven grandchildren.\n\n\n"}

They ensure one's ability to participate in the civil and political life of the Congolese society and state without discrimination or repression.\n\nThis group was born out of frustration with the current political process and diminished social condition in the Democratic Republic of Congo by a group of young Congolese students. These students understood that violence is not the way for anyone willing to find durable solutions to political and social disputes and wars that have torn their country apart for the past half century.\n\nThe one thing that defines the Lutte Pour Le Changement activists is their love for their native DR Congo and the hope to see it prosperous and developed in their lifetime. They have decided to organize a series of non-violent actions throughout major cities in the country to shed light to some of the critical issues facing the Congolese population. Their actions are not limited to keeping politicians honest, but rather engaging the population into participating in the social issues debates. The movement started in the eastern city of Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo in Mid-June 2011 and in no time, the movement had spread all the way to the west of the country, with famous members such as Fred Bauma and Yves Makwambala being incarcerated since March 2015 at the Congolese National Intelligence Agency headquarters in Kinshasa. On March 15, 2015, according to the online news media Pragmora, \"About 30 youth activists and international journalists and observers were arrested in Kinshasa during a youth workshop aimed at increasing youth participation in politics and the electoral process, and creating a new youth movement, Filimbi\". In the recent uprising, many of the LUCHA activists arrested during Dec 19, 2016 have been released, including the 23 year old Gloria Sengha Panda Shala according to Ida Sawyer a Human Rights Watch Director in Central Africa.\n\nThe first LUCHA protest to receive widespread attention was the effort to get the young people to get involved in the 2011 presidential and legislatives elections by ensure that all eligible to vote got registered ahead of the upcoming the elections. Then followed a few actions in regards to lack of clean water in Goma and also issue with garbage waste in the same city. This movement got the eye of the Congolese people because this group managed first and foremost to get the general population to have a say in these critical matters facing their livelihood through the streets of various Congolese cities namely Kinshasa, Mbuji-Mayi, Lubumbashi, Kisangani et Goma.\n\nThe group is determined to ensure there is better governance, respect for human rights and improved and much stronger democracy in the country that faced 32 years of President Mobutu Dictatorship. These inspired Congolese youths driven by social injustice and non democratic political process believe that their movement can bring about positive change in the DR Congo, as well as Africa as a whole.\n\nThese courageous young men have come to know nothing but armed conflicts all of their teenage and adult lives. Therefore, when deciding to create the movement they decided that they will only use non-violent actions as the core principal in raising awareness on social and political issues facing the DRC. Nevertheless, most of these youths have been detained without charge during peaceful protest and /or gatherings. Some of the famous members detained by the Congolese national intelligence agency and have made claims of moral and physical abuses while incarcerated.\n\nWe are leaders. Not hostages of the past. Nor slaves of the present. Nor beggars of our future!\n\nIt also reads on their official site:\n\nWE ARE NOT VIOLENT\n\nWE RISK TOGETHER\n\nWE ASSUME OUR ACTS\n\nLUCHA activists have used web technologies and social media like Facebook, Twitter, and Meetup to coordinate events. The digital evolution with the improvements on the application such as WhatsApp, Imo and Skype has helped the movement with communications, conference calls among participants in various locations within the DR Congo as well as the Congolese diaspora via various Congolese online media, such as Congo Mikili. The group has also been organizing workshops across the country to teach youth on how to engage in social and political issues.\n\n"}

An example is from the Archives at the Yale University Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. It is also applied in areas such as voter registration, where Mac and Mc names may be sorted together in a listing. Technically this is a convention in collation.\n\nOn the other hand, ASCII is a computer standard and its corresponding sorting is gradually replacing this exception to ordinary alphabetisation. Rules once used for filing have been dropped for some newer computer systems, and the interfiling of Mac and Mc names is an example, according to a 2006 book.\n\nThere are in fact a number of options. In addition to sorting them under \"Mac\" and \"Mc\" respectively or choosing to sort them both under \"Mc\", it is known for Mc/Mac names to be placed in position before M.\nThis topic has a complicated and disparate history, spread over different continents and relating to different areas of indexing, cataloguing and filing. The idea of a collating sequence itself has evolved, over time, and the \"Mac and Mc\" together example has been taken as representative of a possible paradigm.\n\nA book on filing rules from 1918 gives an example showing Mc and M' treated as abbreviations, i.e. for Mac, and ordered as if in the expanded version; and a similar book from 1922 makes the rule one of a number that apply also to St. (Saint) and Mrs. (Mistress).\n\nA 1938 book that is a comparative study of cataloguing in various British libraries regarded Mac + Mc + M' sorting as an example of achieved \"standardisation\" in alphabetisation. It gave further examples where, it argued, such standardisation would be beneficial. One example was\n\nin the sense of alphabetising any word with ä as if the letter were replaced by \"ae\". Other examples given are the replacement of \"Sainte\" by \"Saint\" to accommodate the French adjective in its feminine form; or \"Archives\" in journal titles by \"Archive\". The example of the Fitz prefix, a Norman French patronymic, is applied by ignoring the following space, which may or may not occur. The technical terms the author applies are \"letter by letter\" or \"all through\" for the case where spaces are ignored, and \"word by word\" or \"nothing before something\" for the case where space comes before A in the alphabet. In actual practice, some indexes, such as the British Union Catalogue of Periodicals, did practice such extensive standardisation. Sometimes by various technical devices such as replacing terms with conventional abbreviations that would be the same in all languages.\n\nDonald Knuth in vol. 3 of his \"The Art of Computer Programming\" gave a listing showing the operation of around 40 rules, of which \"Mc = Mac\" was one, for library card sorting. He was citing the \"American Library Association Rules for Filing Catalog Cards\" (1942). According to the ALA wiki, it maintains in print two publications on filing rules, one covering that \"word-by-word\" convention, and another prepared in 1980 that is \"letter-by-letter\". A 1998 book attributes the changes to the rules to computer informatics, and notes the Mac/Mc change as its first example.\n\n1982's \"Scottish Roots\", a guide for family history researchers, warns that older Scottish records do not in fact follow this convention, unlike contemporary telephone directories. A 2001 book of \"New York Times\" theatre reviews sorts Mc names as if spelled Mac. A 2002 official document for the State of Vermont recommends explicitly no special treatment for Mac and Mc. A 2007 book in its tenth edition states that \"most library catalogs\" sort Mac and Mc names as if spelled M-a-c.\n\nAmong the guides which generally recommend separating Mac and Mc so that names will be sorted as they are spelled are ISO 999, The Chicago Manual of Style, \"Butcher's Copy-editing: The Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders\", \"The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage\", and \"The SBL Handbook of Style\".\n"}

Painting is done with fingers, twigs, brushes, nib-pens, and matchsticks, etc. using natural dyes and pigments, and is characterised by eye-catching geometrical patterns. There is ritual content for particular occasions, such as birth or marriage, and festivals, such as Holi, Surya Shasti, Kali Puja, Upanayana, Durga Puja.\n\nMadhubani art or Mithila painting was traditionally created by the women of various communities in Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent. It originated from Madhubani district of Mithila region of Bihar, and, it is popularly called Mithila painting or Madhubani art. Madhubani is also a major export centre of these paintings. This painting as a form of wall art was practiced widely throughout the region; the more recent development of painting on paper and canvas mainly originated among the villages around Madhubani, and it is these latter developments led to the name \"Madhubani art\" being used alongside the name \"Mithila Painting.\"\n\nThe painting was traditionally done on freshly plastered mud walls and floors of huts, but now they are also done on cloth, handmade paper and canvas. Madhubani paintings are made from the paste of powdered rice. Madhubani painting has remained confined to a compact geographical area and the skills have been passed on through centuries, the content and the style have largely remained the same. And that is the reason for Madhubani painting being accorded the coveted GI (Geographical Indication) status. Madhubani paintings also use two-dimensional imagery, and the colors used are derived from plants. Ochre and lampblack are also used for reddish brown and black respectively.\n\nMadhubani paintings mostly depict the men & its association with nature and the scenes & deity from the ancient epics. Natural objects like the sun, the moon, and religious plants like tulsi are also widely painted, along with scenes from the royal court and social events like weddings. Generally, no space is left empty; the gaps are filled by paintings of flowers, animals, birds, and even geometric designs. Traditionally, painting was one of the skills that was passed down from generation to generation in the families of the Mithila Region, mainly by women.\nIt is still practiced and kept alive in the institutions spread across Mithila region. Kalakriti in Darbhanga, Vaidehi in Madhubani, Benipatti in Madhubani district and Gram Vikas Parishad in Ranti are some of the major centers of Madhubani painting which has kept this ancient art form alive. \nMadhubani art has five distinctive styles, namely, Bharni, Katchni, Tantrik, Godna and Kohbar. In the 1960s Bharni, Kachni and Tantrik style were mainly done by Brahman and Kayashth women, who are 'upper caste' women in India and Nepal. Their themes were mainly religious and they depicted Gods and Goddesses, flora and fauna in their paintings. People of lower castes include aspects of their daily life and symbols, story of Raja Shailesh [ guard of village] and much more, in their paintings. But nowadays Madhubani art has become a globalised art form so there is no difference in the work of artists of the region on the basis of the caste system. They are working in all five styles. Madhubani art has received worldwide attention.<ref name=\"a-painter-from-patna-crafted-a-live-madhubani-painting-in-bangkok/\">\n"}

In essence Pallottino created the modern discipline of Etruscology and trained many of its leading practitioners. He published a massive corpus of material during his career and established a research center in Rome, today known as \"C.N.R. per l'Archeologia etrusco-italica\". He was also influential in establishing the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Etruschi e Italici and its journal, \"Studi Etruschi\". His own work covered Etruscan art and culture, civilization, and language. One of his most influential works was the handbook \"Etruscologia\" originally published in 1942 in Milan, but today available in numerous languages and still consulted by scholars and students alike. Pallottino was a member of the faculty of the Università di Roma, \"La Sapienza\".\n\nIn 1937, Pallottino wrote an article debunking the so-called \"Etruscan Warrior\" purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art (by John Marshall under the direction of Gisela M. A. Richter), as a forgery. Richter remained unconvinced, but Pallottino was ultimately proven correct by the scholar Harold Parsons in 1961. Pallottino pointed out the Greek Hellenized world that Etruscan art emerged from. He wrote the volume on \"Etruscan Painting\" (1952) for Albert Skira's series on Great Centuries of Painting.

{"id": "3924640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3924640", "title": "Mukhannathun", "text": "Mukhannathun\n\nMukhannathun ( \"effeminate ones\", \"men who resemble women\", singular \"mukhannath\") was a term used in Classical Arabic to refer to men who were perceived as effeminate. \"Mukhannathun\", especially those in the city of Medina, are mentioned throughout the ahadith and in the works of many early Arabic and Islamic writers. During the Rashidun era and first half of the Umayyad era, they were strongly associated with music and entertainment. During the Abbasid caliphate, the word itself was used as a descriptor for men employed as dancers, musicians, or comedians.\n\nIn later eras, the term \"mukhannath\" was associated with the receptive partner in gay sexual practices, an association that has persisted into the modern day. Khanith is a vernacular Arabic term used in some parts of the Arabian Peninsula to denote the gender role ascribed to males who function sexually, and in some ways socially, as women. The term is closely related to the word \"mukhannath\".\n\nThe origins of the term are disputed. The 8th century lexicographer Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi connected \"mukhannath\" to \"khuntha\", meaning hermaphrodite. Based on this etymology, he stated that the word \"mukhannath\" refers to an intersex person. According to the 9th century Arabic scholar Abu Ubayd, the term \"mukhannath\" instead derives from the verb \"khanatha\", meaning \"to fold back the mouth of a waterskin for drinking\", indicating some measure of being languid or delicate. This definition attained prominence among Islamic scholars until medieval times, when the term came to be associated with homosexuality.\n\n\"Mukhannathun\" existed in the pre-Islamic and early Islamic eras. A number of ahadith indicate that \"mukhannathun\" were used as male servants for wealthy women in the early days of Islam, due to the belief that they were not sexually interested in the female body. These sources do not state that the \"mukhannathun\" were homosexual, only that they \"lack desire\". \n\nVarious ahadith say Muhammad cursed the \"mukhannathun\" and their female equivalents, \"mutarajjilat\", and ordered his followers to remove them from their homes. \n\nAccording to one hadith, this incident was prompted by a \"mukhannath\" servant of Muhammad’s wife Umm Salama commenting upon the body of a woman. This comment may have convinced Muhammad that the \"mukhannathun\" were only pretending to have no interest in women, and therefore could not be trusted around them. This story places the incident around the time of the Siege of Ta'if.\n\nEarly Islamic literature rarely comments upon the habits of the \"mukhannathun\". It seems there may have been some variance in how \"effeminate\" they were, though there are indications that some adopted aspects of feminine dress or at least ornamentation. One hadith states that a Muslim \"mukhannath\" who had dyed his hands and feet with henna (traditionally a feminine activity) was banished from Medina, but not killed for his behavior.\n\nOther ahadith also mention the punishment of banishment, both in connection with Umm Salama’s servant and a man who worked as a musician. Muhammad described the musician as a \"mukhannath\" and threatened to banish him if he did not end his unacceptable career.\n\nBeyond these incidents, there are few sources elaborating upon the \"mukhannathun\" during Muhammad’s lifetime.\n\nIn the Rashidun and Umayyad eras, various \"mukhannathun\" of Medina established themselves as celebrated musicians. One particularly prominent \"mukhannath\" with the \"laqab\" Tuways (\"little peacock\") was born in Medina on the day Muhammad died.\n\nThere are few sources that describe why Tuways was labeled a \"mukhannath\", or what behavior of his was considered effeminate. No sources describe his sexuality as immoral or imply that he was attracted to men, and he is reported to have married a woman and fathered several children in his later life. While he is described as non-religious or even frivolous towards religion in many sources, others contradict this and portray him as a believing Muslim instead. His main association with the label seems to come from his profession, as music was mainly performed by women in Arab societies. Tuways is described as the first \"mukhannath\" to perform \"perfect singing\" characterized by definitive rhythmic patterns in Medina. He was also known for his sharp wit and his skill with the tambourine, which had previously been associated only with female musicians. \n\nSome scholars believe that Tuways and other \"mukhannathun\" musicians formed an intermediary stage in the social class most associated with musical performance: women in pre-Islamic times, \"mukhannathun\" in the Rashidun and early Umayyad caliphates, and mainly non-\"mukhannath\" men in later time periods. While many still disapproved of the \"mukhannathun\" in general in this era, the musicians among them were nonetheless valued and prized for their skill. Some of the more well-known \"mukhannathun\" also served as go-betweens and matchmakers for men and women.\n\nWhile Tuways is typically described as the leading \"mukhannath\" musician of Medina during his lifetime, historical sources describe others who served a similar role providing musical and poetic entertainment. A man with the \"laqab\" al-Dalal (\"the coquettish\") is mentioned as one of Tuways’ pupils. He is portrayed as a witty but sometimes crude man who \"loved women\" but did not have sex with them. Unlike Tuways, some tales involving al-Dalal do suggest that he was attracted to men.\n\nWhile sporadic persecution of \"mukhannathun\" dates back to the time of Muhammad, their large-scale governmental persecution began in the Umayyad caliphate. This may have been prompted by \"a perceived connection between cross-dressing and a lack of proper religious commitment\", according to the scholar Everett K. Rowson. Some sources associate the beginning of severe persecution with Marwan I and his brother Yahya, who served as a governor under the caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, while others put it in the time of Abd al-Malik’s son, Al-Walid I. The governor of Mecca serving under al-Walid is said to have “issued a proclamation against the \"mukhannathun\"”, in addition to other singers and drinkers of wine. Two \"mukhannathun\" musicians named Ibn Surayj and al-Gharid are specifically named as being impacted by this proclamation, with al-Gharid fleeing to Yemen and never returning. Like al-Dalal, al-Gharid is portrayed as not just \"effeminate\" but homosexual in some sources. Beyond these two men, relatively little is known of the \"mukhannathun\" of Mecca, compared to the more well-known group in Medina.\n\nThe most severe instance of persecution is typically dated to the time of al-Walid's brother and successor Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik. According to several variants of this story, the caliph ordered the full castration of the \"mukhannathun\" of Medina. Some versions of the tale say that all of them were forced to undergo the procedure, while others state that only a few of them were; in the latter case, al-Dalal is almost always included as one of the castrated \"mukhannathun\".\n\nSome variants of the story add a series of witticisms supposedly uttered by the \"mukhannathun\" prior to their castration:\n\nAfter this event, the \"mukhannathun\" of Medina begin to fade from historical sources, and the next generation of singers and musicians had few \"mukhannathun\" in their ranks. Rowson states that though many details of the stories of their castration were undoubtedly invented, “this silence supports the assumption that they did suffer a major blow sometime around the caliphate of Sulayman.”\n\nBy the days of the Abbasid caliph al-Mamun, the \"mukhannathun\" working as entertainment were now more associated with court jesters than famed musicians, and the term itself seems to have become synonymous with an individual employed as a comedian or pantomime. The Abbasid caliphs al-Mamun and al-Mutawakkil employed a famed \"mukhannath\" named Abbada as an actor in comedic plays. He served as a buffoon whose act depended upon mockery and \"low sexual humor\", the latter of which involved the flaunting of his \"passive homosexuality\". These characteristics would define \"mukhannathun\" in later eras, and they never regained the relatively esteemed status they held in the early days in Medina.\n\nThe eighth-century scholar Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri stated that one should pray behind \"mukhannathun\" only in cases of necessity. Some thirteenth and fourteenth-century scholars like an-Nawawi and al-Kirmani classified \"mukhannathun\" into two groups: those whose feminine traits seem unchangeable, despite the person’s best efforts to stop them, and those whose traits are changeable but refuse to stop. Islamic scholars like Ibn Hajar al-‘Asqalani stated that all \"mukhannathun\" must make an effort to cease their feminine behavior, but if this proved impossible, they were not worthy of punishment. Those who made no effort to become less \"effeminate\", or seemed to \"take pleasure in (his effeminacy)\", were worthy of blame. By this era, \"mukhannath\" had developed its association with homosexuality, and Badr al-Din al-Ayni saw homosexuality as \"a more heinous extension of \"takhannuth\"\", or effeminate behavior.\n\nIbn 'Abd al-Barr stated that \"mukhannathun\" in his era were \"known to be promiscuous\", and resembled women in \"softness, speech, appearance, accent and thinking\". These \"mukhannathun\" were the ones initially allowed to be the servants of women, as they did not demonstrate any physical attraction to the female body.\n\nWhile sometimes classified as transgender individuals, \"mukhannathun\" as a group do not fit neatly into any one of the prevailing categories of gender or sexuality used by modern LGBT communities. Although they were probably not predominantly cisgender or heterosexual, it cannot be said that they were simply either homosexual males or transgender women. There was too much variety between one \"mukhannath\" and the next to determine a specific label for their gender or sexual identity, and the term's meaning changed over time.\n\nLikewise, while some \"mukhannathun\" are said to have engaged in homosexuality, others did not, complicating efforts to label them gay men. According to Muhsin Hendricks:\nIn the late 1980s, Mufti Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy of Egypt issued a fatwa supporting the right for those who fit the description of \"mukhannathun\" to have sex reassignment surgery. Tantawy seems to have associated the concept with hermaphroditism or intersex individuals. Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued similar fatwas around the same time. Khomeini's initial fatwa concerned intersex individuals as well, but he later specified that sex reassignment surgery was also permissible in the case of transgender individuals. Because homosexuality is illegal in Iran but transgenderism is legal, some gay individuals have been urged to undergo the surgery and transition into the opposite sex, regardless of their actual gender identity.\n\nIn Pakistan, the hijras are officially recognized as a third gender that is neither male nor female, a concept that some have compared to \"mukhannathun\".\n\nSome modern Islamic authorities say that if an individual deemed a \"khuntha\" or intersex has an unclear gender, it is not permissible for him to marry a woman until a medical professional confirms that he is male.\n\n"}

They are produced by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Department of Commerce. They are one of the main sources of data on general economic activity in the United States.\n\nThey use double-entry accounting to report the monetary value and sources of output produced in the country and the distribution of incomes that production generates. Data are available at the national and industry levels.\n\nSeven summary accounts are published, as well as a much larger number of more specific accounts. The first summary account shows gross domestic product (GDP) and its major components.\nThe table summarizes national income on the left (debit, revenue) side and national product on the right (credit, expense) side of a two-column accounting report. Thus the left side gives GDP by the income method, and the right side gives GDP by the expenditure method.\nThe GDP is given on the bottom line of both sides of the report. GDP must have the same value on both sides of the account. This is because income and expenditure are defined in a way that forces them to be equal (see accounting identity). We show the 2003 table later in this article; we present the left side first for convenient screen display.\n\nThe U.S. report (updated quarterly) is available in several forms, including interactive, from links on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) NIPA () page. Other countries report based on their own adopted system of National accounts which are frequently based on the U.S. NIPAs, the widely adopted United Nations System of National Accounts, or their own custom approach. The level of detail (granularity) accounted for internally, and reported publicly, varies widely across countries. Likewise, a nation's system of accounts, (analogous to a firm's Chart of accounts) are typically gradually revised and updated on their own individual schedule. The U.S. NIPAs are prepared by the staff of the Directorate for National Economic Accounts within the BEA. The source data largely originate from public sources, such as government surveys and administrative data, and they are supplemented by data from private sources, such as data from trade associations (BEA 2008: 1–6).\n\nThe income side of the national income and product account report begins with the kinds of income people might have. Employee compensation includes the wages and salaries paid to anyone whose income is subject to income tax withholding. Since wages and salaries affect more individuals and families directly than the other sources of income, it has by far the largest value.\n\nProprietors' income is the payments to those who own non-corporate businesses, including sole proprietors and partners. inventory value adjustment (IVA) and capital consumption adjustment (CCA) are corrections for changes in the value of proprietor's inventory (goods that may be sold within one year) and capital (goods like machines and buildings that are not expected to be sold within one year) under rules set by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nRental income of persons excludes rent paid to corporate real estate companies. Real estate is capital rather than inventory by definition, so there is no IVA.\n\nCorporate profits with IVA and CCA is like the entries for proprietors' income and rental income except that the organization is a corporation. Corporate profit is shown before taxes, which are part of taxes on production and imports, two lines down.\n\nBusiness current transfer payments is not explained here.\n\nNet interest and miscellaneous payments is interest paid minus interest received plus payments to individuals and corporations that are not elsewhere classified (NEC). Taxes on production and imports does not include corporate income tax payments to the states and to the federal government. Taxes on production and imports were previously classified as \"indirect business taxes\" and include excise taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, and other taxes relating to business production. While the report includes the net value of interest payments and receipts, both the taxes paid and subsidies from the government are shown.\n\nNational income (NI) is the sum of employees, proprietors, rental, corporate, interest, and government income less the subsidies government pays to any of those groups.\n\nNet national product (NNP) is National Income plus or minus the statistical discrepancy that accumulates when aggregating data from millions of individual reports. In this case, the statistical discrepancy is US$25.6 billion, or about 0.23% of gross domestic product. A discrepancy that small (less than three-tenths of one percent) is immaterial under accounting standards.\n\nGross national product is net national product plus an allowance for the consumption of fixed capital, mostly buildings and machines, usually called depreciation. Capital is used up in production but it does not vanish.\n\nFinally, GDP is gross national product plus payments from the rest of the world that are income to residents of the U.S. minus payments from the US to the rest of the world that count as income where they are received.\n\nMacroeconomics defines GDP, from the production perspective, as the sum of personal consumption, investment, net exports, and government expenditures; .\n\nThe production side report also begins with individuals and families, in this case their personal consumption expenditures on goods and services, C in the definition. Durable goods are expected to last more than a year (furniture, appliances, cars, etc.) and to have little or no secondary resale market. Nondurable goods are used up within a year (food, clothing, medicine...). Services includes everything else, everything we buy that has little or no physical presence, like banking, health care, insurance, movie tickets, and so on.\n\nGross private domestic investment includes expenditures on goods that are expected to be used for an extended period of time, I in the definition. Residential investment includes owner occupied and rental housing. Nonresidential investment includes buildings, machinery, and equipment used for commercial or industrial purposes (small business, agriculture, manufacturing, service, etc.). The last element of Investment accounts for any change in the value of previous investments that are still in use, called inventory.\n\nNet Exports reports the balance between goods produced domestically but consumed abroad (X) and goods produced abroad but consumed domestically (M). There is no distinction between consumption and investment or between the private and public sectors; a consumer's imported television, a corporation's imported lab equipment, and the government's use of imported food on military bases count equally. When net exports are positive, the country has a trade surplus. When Net Exports are negative, there is a trade deficit.\n\nGovernment Consumption Expenditures and Gross Investment includes all government expenditures on domestically produced goods and services. Like an individual or family, the government consumes food, clothing, furniture, and other goods and services in its administrative, military, correctional, and other programs. Governments also invest in buildings for program use and in improvements to harbors, rivers, roads, and airports. Transfer payments, like subsidies to the unemployed or the retired, are \"not\" included in this item, since they are simply a movement of money from government to citizens, rather than a purchase of goods or services.\n\nThe sum of the four production categories is gross domestic product, the value of all domestic expenditures on goods and services. GDP (income) must equal GDP (production) except for any rounding error that accumulates when the data used to prepare a table includes rounding at prior stages of analysis, as appears to have happened in this case.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33606303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33606303", "title": "Otium", "text": "Otium\n\nOtium, a Latin abstract term, has a variety of meanings, including leisure time in which a person can enjoy eating, playing, resting, contemplation and academic endeavors. It sometimes, but not always, relates to a time in a person's retirement after previous service to the public or private sector, opposing \"active public life\". \"Otium\" can be a temporary time of leisure, that is sporadic. It can have intellectual, virtuous or immoral implications. It originally had the idea of withdrawing from one's daily business (\"negotium\") or affairs to engage in activities that were considered to be artistically valuable or enlightening (\"i.e.\" speaking, writing, philosophy). It had particular meaning to businessmen, diplomats, philosophers and poets.\n\nIn ancient Roman culture \"otium\" was a military concept as its first Latin usage. This was in Ennius' \"Iphigenia.\"\n\n\"Iphigenia\" (241–248)\nAccording to historian Carl Deroux in his work \"Studies in Latin literature and Roman history\", the word \"otium\" appears for the first time in a chorus of Ennius' Iphigenia. Ennius' first use of the term \"otium\" around 190 BC showed the restlessness and boredom during a reprieve from war and was termed \"otium negotiosum\" (free time to do what one wanted) and \"otium otiosum\" (idle wasteless free time). Aulus Gellius, while discussing the word \"praeterpropter\" (\"more or less\") quotes a fragment of Ennius's \"Iphigenia\", which contrasts \"otium\" with \"negotium\" repeatedly. Ennius imagined the emotions of Agamemnon's soldiers at Aulus, that while in the field and not at war and not allowed to go home, as \"more or less\" \"living\".\n\nThe earliest extant appearance of the word in Latin literature occurs in a fragment from the soldiers' chorus in the \"Iphigenia\" of Ennius, where it is contrasted to \"negotium\". Researches have determined the etymological and semantic use of \"otium\" was never a direct translation of the Greek word \"schole\", but derived from specifically Roman contexts. \"Otium\" is an example of the usage of the term \"praeterpropter\", meaning more or less of leisure. It was first used in military terms related to inactivity during war. In ancient Roman times soldiers were many times unoccupied, resting and bored to death when not at war (\"i.e.\", winter months, weather not permitting war). This was associated with \"otium otiosum\" (unoccupied and pointless leisure—idle leisure). The opposite of this was \"otium negotiosum\" (busy leisure) - leisure with a satisfying hobby or being able to take care of one's personal affairs or one's own estate. This was \"otium privatum\" (private leisure), equal to \"negotium\" (a type of business).\n\nThe oldest citation for \"otium\" is this chorus of soldiers, singing about idleness on campaign, in an otherwise lost Latin tragedy by Ennius. Andre shows in these lines that Ennius is showing the soldiers in the field would rather go home tending to their own affairs (\"otium\") than to be idle doing nothing. Its military origin meant to stop fighting in battle and laying down of the weapons - a time for peace. Even though originally \"otium\" was a military concept in early Roman culture of laying down one's weapons, it later became an elite prestigious time for caring for oneself. The ancient Romans had a sense of obligatory work ethics in their culture and considered the idle-leisure definition of \"otium\" as a waste of time. Historians of ancient Roman considered \"otium\" a time of laborious leisure of much personal duties instead of public duties. Author Almasi shows that historians Jean-Marie Andre and Brian Vickers point out the only legitimate form of \"otium\" was transpired with intellectual activity. \"Otium\" was thought of by the wise elite as being free from work and other obligations (\"negotium\") and leisure time spent on productive activities, however a time that should not be wasted as was thought the non-elite did with their leisure time.\n\nThe favorable sense of \"otium\" in Ciceronian Latin reflects the Greek term (\"skholē\", \"leisure\", a meaning retained in Modern Greek as σχόλη, \"schólē\"); \"leisure\" having a complex history in Greek philosophy before being used in Latin (through Latin the word became the root of many education-related English terms, such as school, scholar and scholastic). In Athens, leisure was one of the marks of the Athenian gentleman: the time to do things right, unhurried time, time to discuss in. From there it became \"discussion\", and from there, philosophical and educational schools, which were both conducted by discussion. Four major Greek philosophical schools influenced the Roman gentlemen of Cicero's time. Plato (and his contemporaries, if the \"Greater Hippias\" be not authentic) brought \"schole\" into philosophy; as often, Plato can be quoted on both sides of the question whether leisure is better than the business of a citizen. In the \"Greater Hippias\", it is one weakness of the title character that, although he has the education and manners of a gentleman, he has no leisure; but Socrates, in the \"Apology\", has no leisure either; he is too busy as a gad-fly, keeping his fellow Athenians awake to virtue. However, by the time the Romans encountered Plato's school, the Academy, they had largely ceased to discuss anything so practical as the good life; the New Academy of Carneades practiced verbal agility and boundless skepticism.\n\nTheophrastus and Dicaearchus, students of Aristotle, debated much on the contemplative life and the active life.\n\nRoman Epicureans used \"otium\" for the quiet bliss promised by Epicurus. An Epicurean proverb \nThe phrase \"to be at ease\" can have the meaning \"to be of good cheer\" or \"to be without fear\" these being interdependent. The Epicurean idea of \"otium\" favors contemplation, compassion, gratitude and friendship. The Epicurean view is that wisdom has as much to contribute to the benefit of the public as does that of contributions of politicians and laborers (\"i.e.\" sailors). The rustic \"otium\" concept incorporates country living into Epicureanism. The active city public life of \"negotium\" and an \"otium\" of reserved country life of reflection have been much written about by Cicero and Seneca the Younger.\n\nEpicurus's philosophy was contrary to Hellenistic Stoicism. Epicurus promised enjoyment in retirement as a concept of \"otium\". The concept of the Epicurean \"otium\" (private world of leisure) and the contemplative life were represented in Epicurus' school of philosophy and his garden. The portraits of the Garden of Epicurus near Athens represented political and cultural heroes of the time. Twenty-first–century historians Gregory Warden and David Romano have argued that the layout of the sculptures in \"The Garden\" were designed to give the viewer contrasting viewpoints of the Epicurean \"otium\" and the Hellenistic Stoic viewpoint of \"otium\" (\"i.e.\" private or public; contemplation or \"employment\"; \"otium\" or \"negotium\").\n\nIn early and colloquial Latin, despite the etymological contrast, \"otium\" is often used pejoratively, in contrast rather to \"officium\", \"office, duty\" than to \"negotium\" ('business\"). There was a difference established in ancient Roman times (second century BCE and forward) developing the idea elite social status was when one fulfilled one's duties in business and then \"otium\" meant \"leisure\" while \"negotium\" meant \"non-leisure\" (work duties still needed to be done). This new time of \"otium\" was filled by Greek scholarly pursuits and Greek pleasures. The time environment within which a person existed had sides to it that were filled with Greek customs such as pastimes, hobbies, interchanges of thoughts and ideas, and private bathing. \"Otium \" and \"negotium\" was then a new social concept which has perpetuated to our own time.\n\nHistorian J.M. Andre concludes that the original sense of \"otium\" was related to military service and the idleness that happened in the winter, as opposed to the business (\"negotium\") of the rest of the year. The most ancient Roman calendar divided the year into ten months devoted to war and farming, leaving the winter months of January and February vacant for individual \"otium.\" Andre shows that the beauty of the individual \"otium\" poses rest. Titus Maccius Plautus in his play \"Mercator\" says that while you are young is the time to save up for your retirement otium so you can enjoy it later, in his claim \"tum in otium te conloces, dum potes, ames\" (then you may set yourself at your ease, drink and be amorous).\n\nCicero speaks of himself, with the expression \"otium cum dignitate\", that time spent in activities one prefers is suitable for a Roman citizen who has retired from public life. When he was ousted from each office, this forced an inactive period, which he used for \"worthy leisure\". During this time he composed \"Tusculanae Disputationes\", a series of books on Stoic philosophy. Cicero saw free time as a time to devote to writing. Cicero defines \"otium\" as leisure, avoiding active participation in politics. He further defines it as a state of security and peace (pax) - a type of \"public health\". It is often associated with tranquility. Cicero advises in his third book \"On Duties\" that when the city life becomes too much, one should retreat to the country for leisure. The term \"otium cum dignitate\" in Cicero's \"Pro Sestio\" was to mean peace (pax) for all and distinction for some. Cicero says in \"Pro Sestio\", XLV., 98\nCicero explains that, while not necessarily his cup of tea, he recognized many different ways to spend leisure time and \"otium\". In one passage of \"De Oratore\" he explains that Philistus spent his retirement writing history as his \"otium\". He goes on to say in \"De Oratore\" Book iii that other men passed their \"otium\" of leisure due to bad weather that prevented them from doing their daily chores to playing ball, knucklebones, dice games or just games they made up. Others that were \"retired\" from public life for whatever reason devoted their \"otium cum seritio\" (leisure with service) to poetry, mathematics, music and teaching children.\n\nGerman historian Klaus Bringmann shows in Cicero's works that one can not characterize him as a hypocrite while in \"otium\" because of his sense of duty to serve the state. Cicero's concept of \"otium\" does not mean selfish pursuit of pleasure. It means the well-earned leisure which is a culmination of a long career of action and achievement. It's a reward. Idleness (\"desidia\") had derogatory implications and unqualified \"otium\" was a problem for Cicero's elite group of followers. Its break away from civic affairs contrasted with \"negotia publica\", participation in civic affairs of the republican aristocracy. To distinguish between plain \"idleness\" and aristocratic \"otium homestum\", \"otium liberale\" or \"otium cum dignitate\", writers of the day said that literary and philosophical pursuits were worthwhile activities and that they had benefit to \"res publica\" (the general public). These pursuits were a type of 'employment' and therefore not mere laziness.\n\nCicero praises Cato the Elder for his respectful use of \"otium\" in his expression \"non minus otii quam negotii\" (no less for doing nothing than business). Cicero was associating \"otium\" with writing and thinking when he admires Cato for pointing out that Scipio Africanus claimed he was \"never less idle than when he was at leisure, and never less lonely than when he was alone.\" Cicero in his \"De Officiis\" (book III 1-4) further says of Scipio Africanus \"Leisure and solitude, which serve to make others idle, in Scipio's case acted as a goad.\" Cicero's idea of \"otium cum dignitate\" (leisure with dignity) is considerably different from today's version of the concept. In his time, this kind of \"free time\" was only for the few privileged elite and was mostly made possible by the toil of slaves. It was associated with an egotistic and arrogant lifestyle, compared to those who had to earn their own living with no slaves. Today technology and educational systems enter into the equation on making leisure time (\"otium\") available to almost everyone, not just the privileged elite, which enables the pursuit of hobbies. Cicero has a number of different concept versions for \"otium\". In one concept he feels that a lifetime of loyalty attending one's duty (\"maximos labores\") should be rewarded with some form of retirement. This then promotes great sacrifices which promotes civic peace with honor within the state. He points out that the tranquillity one enjoys is due to the efforts of the majority. This concept of retirement through a lifetime of work was enjoyed only by the ruling class and the elite. The common people could only hope to enjoy a leisurely retirement with dignity as an inheritance.\n\nCatullus, a late Roman Republic poet, in his poems shows that the significance of \"otium\" of the middle Republican time of autonomy into the concept of how, why, and when a member of the patronal class might exchange political activity for literary leisure. He tended to mark \"otium\" with erotic influence.\n\nThe imperial dictatorship by Augustus during the fall of the Roman Republic put the Roman ruling classes into a state of change as their traditional role as always being in town was no longer needed. They were given much leisure time (\"otium\") because of their wealth. The wives of wealthy men were known to write poetry in special rooms devoted to education of the entire family (except the master of the house as it would have been below his dignity).\n\nThe home of choice (\"domus\") then became the countryside villa as the rise of the Roman Empire made them even wealthier. They could afford almost anything they could dream up in the way of a residence, especially among the large and middle class Roman landowners. Greek-style architecture became their new villa otium outside of town. In ancient Roman times the \"otium villa \" was a Dionysian idealistic rural home setting that evoked peace, leisure, simplicity and serenity. Often in ancient writings is found the mention of restorative powers due its natural setting (\"otium\") in the rural country home, contrasted to the busy city life with all the businesses (\"negotium\"). The \"villa with a garden\" and \"villa by the sea\" was associated with \"otium\".\nThe life at the Roman villa was associated with Greek culture in rooms which had Greek themes indicating a \"superior world\" of living.\n\nThe Imperial Roman poet Statius writes of a \"otium villa\" that he planned to retire to in Naples in his work \"Silvae\": \"It has secure peace, an idle life of leisure, non-troubled rest and sleep. There is no madness in the market-place, no strict laws in dispute...\" Pliny the Younger exemplified the philosophy of the Roman elite in \"otium\" of the time by the life he lived from his \"otium villas\". He would dictate letters to his secretary, read Greek and Latin speeches, go on walks on the villa's grounds, dine and socialize with friends, meditate, exercise, bath, take naps and occasionally hunt.\n\nTibullus was an Augustan elegiac poet who offered an alternative lifestyle to the Roman ideal of the military man or the man of action. He preferred the country lifestyle. In his existing first two books of poetry he compares the lifestyle of his chief friend and patron Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus as a commander and soldier to that of a farmer. Tibullus in his poem 1.3 rejects the work style of the rich man, \"adsiduus labor\", and military service (\"militia\"). He shows in his poetry that originally \"otium\" was a military concept, the disuse of one's weapons. Tibullus prefers the rustic agricultural landscape and a simple life. He indicates that while he would do agricultural work, he would only be interested in doing it sometimes (\"interdum\") and therefore inserts \"otium\" (peace and leisure time) into agricultural life. He expresses in his attitude of his poetry that the qualities of the Epicurean resolve to quietism (occultism—religious mysticism) and pacifism (abstention from violence) as the pursuits of \"ignobile otium\" (mean leisure) - peace of mind (peace with one's self) and detachment from worldly ambitions.\n\nSeneca compares the difference in the Epicurean and Stoic choice of \"otium\". He confesses that classic Stoicism urges active public life while Epicurus has a tendency not to advance public life unless forced to. Seneca views Stoicism and Epicureanism as legitimate to inaction in the proper situations. He defends the Stoic philosophy as leaning toward \"otium\". The main responsibility for the Stoic is to benefit the public in some manner. This could be done by the cultivation of virtue or the research of nature in retirement. This would mean a life of meditation and contemplation rather than an active political life. Seneca shows that \"otium\" is not really \"free time\", but a study of other matters (\"i.e.\", reading, writing) other than political and career gains.\n\nThe increase of retirees retreating to rural villas became more attractive as writers of the day wrote that Stoic ways included pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy. This meant that the work of public duties was replaced by \"otium liberale\" (liberal leisure) and was sanctified if the retiree did pursuits of reading, writing and philosophy. The benefits of the simplicity of rustic country life was reinforced in the intellectual legitimacy of \"otium ruris\" (rural leisure) because it drew out the spiritual implications of Horatian and Vergilian images of this type of life. Seneca's doctrine of \"De Otio\" describes retirement from public life. The contemplative life that Seneca revised was a Roman debate on \"otium\" (a productive peaceful time) and at some point in the evolution of the term was later contrasted to \"negotium\".\n\nThese are some of the elements in Seneca's doctrine of \"De Otio\":\n\nWhile Seneca's doctrine appears to be close to the doctrine of Athenodorus's \"De Tranquillitate\" it is basically different. In \"De Otio 3.5\" Seneca points out the benefits towards man in general, while in \"De Tranquillitate\" the theme is peace of mind.\n\nSaint Augustine of Hippo reminded Romans of \"otium philosophandi\", a positive element, that life was happiest when one had time to philosophize. Augustine points out that \"otium\" was the prerequisite for contemplation. It was because of \"otium\" that Alypius of Thagaste steered Augustine away from marriage. He said that they could not live a life together in the love of wisdom if he married. Augustine described \"Christianae vita otium\" as the Christian life of leisure. Many Christian writers of the time interpreted the Roman idea of \"otium\" as the deadly sin of acedia (sloth). Some Christian writers formulated \"otium\" as meaning to serve God through deep thought. Christian writers encouraged biblical studies to justify \"otium\". These same Christian writers also showed \"otium ruris\" (secluded rural leisure) as a needed step to monastic \"propositum\". Augustine describes the monastic life as \"otium sanctum\" (sanctified leisure or approved leisure). In Augustine's time the idea of philosophy had two poles of ambitions—one to be a worthy Christian (vacation - \"negotium\") and the other to be a worthy friend of God (devotion - \"otium\").\n\nPetrarch, 14th-century poet and Renaissance humanist, discusses \"otium\" in his \"De vita solitaria\" as it relates to a human life of simple habits and self-restraint. Like his favorite Roman authors Cicero, Horace, Seneca, Ovid and Livy, he sees \"otium\" not as leisure time devoted to idleness, passion, entertainment or mischievous wrongdoing; but time ideally spent on nature appreciation, serious research, meditation, contemplation, writing and friendship.\n\nPetrarch considered solitude (\"i.e.\", rural setting, \"villa otium\", his Vaucluse home) and its relationship to \"otium\" as a great possession for a chance at intellectual activity, the same philosophy as Cicero and Seneca. He would share such a precious commodity with his best friends in the spirit of Seneca when he said \"no good thing is pleasant to possess without friends to share it.\"\n\nHistorian Julia Bondanella translates Petrarch's Latin words of his own personal definition of \"otium\":\nPetrarch stressed the idea of an active mind even in \"otium\" (leisure). He refers back to Augustine's \"Vetus Itala\" in \"De otio religioso\" where in Christianity it was associated with contemplation and \"vacatio\" (vacate—be still). He points out that this is associated with \"videre\" (to see), which in Christianity is physical and mental activity aimed at moral perfection. He relates this concept of \"otium\" as \"vacate et videte\" (be still and see—a form of meditation, contemplation). Petrarch points out that one should not take leisure as so relaxed as to weaken the mind, but to be active in leisure to build up strength in the view of a unique character and religion.\n\nAndrew Marvell’s seventeenth-century poem The Garden is a lyric of nine stanzas in which he rejects all forms of activity in the world in favor of solitude of the retiree in a garden. It is a type of retirement poem expressing the love of retirement—an ancient Roman concept related to \"otium\". The poem shows the high degree of pleasure of rural retirement. Some critics see that he shows \"otium\" to mean peace, quiet and leisure—a goal for retirement from politics and business. Others see a Christianized \"otium\" with Marvell showing a representation of the progress of a soul from the pursuit for the pagan promised land of the peaceful countryside and contemplation to the search for the lost heaven on earth.\n\nPart of Marvell's poem The Garden below:\n\nBrian Vickers, a 20th-century British literary scholar, points out an expression made by Friedrich Nietzsche, a 19th-century German philosopher, on scholars' opinion of \"otium\" in his 1878 publication \"Menschliches, Allzumenschliches\":\n\nPrivate life meaning of \"otium\" meant personal retirement—the opposite of business. It meant leisure only for one's own pleasure with no benefit to the state or public. Examples here is where one attends only his own farm or estate. Another is hunting. It was the opposite of \"active public life\". One would not be a historian in this case.\n\nIn public life \"otium\" meant public peace and relief after war. It meant freedom from the enemy with no hostilities. It was not only freedom from external assault (the enemy), it was also freedom from internal disorder (civil war). This then had the meaning of leisure, peace and safety at the homeland. This eventually became the \"status quo\": acceptance of existing political and social conditions of the local laws, the custom of the ancestors, the powers of magistrates, authority of the senate, religions, the military, the treasury, and the praise of the empire.\n\n\n\"Otium\" carried with it many different meanings (including but not limited to time, chance, opportunity), depending on the time period or the philosophers involved in determining the concept.\n\nSynonyms of positive connotations are:\n\nSynonyms of negative connotations are:\n\nFor a comparatively recent and exhaustive authoritative study on \"otium\"' in the history of Roman culture see \n\nGregory M. Sadlek gives even a more recent and exhaustive study on \"otium\"' in his 2004 book \" Idleness working: the discourse of love's labor from Ovid through Chaucer and Gower\", .\n\n\n\n\n"}

Devereux is a co-founder and the managing editor of the academic publication \"Time & Mind – the Journal of Archaeology, Consciousness and Culture\", a research associate with the Royal College of Art (2007-2013), and a Research Fellow with the International Consciousness Research Laboratories (ICRL) group at Princeton University.\n\nPaul Devereux' work primarily deals with archaeological themes, especially archaeoacoustics (the study of sound at archaeological sites), the anthropology of consciousness (ancient and pre-modern worldviews), ecopsychology, unusual geophysical phenomena, and consciousness studies, spanning the range from academic to popular. He has written or co-written 28 books since 1979. He originated two Channel 4 (UK) television documentaries.\n\nPaul Devereux grew up in Leicester. He painted and studied at the Ravensbourne College of Art and Design in London. With a preference for abstract expressionism, he found increasing inspiration in the geometry and ground plans of ancient sites. He admits to experiencing LSD and mescaline in college, and having at least one profound epiphany under the influence in 1966. He also witnessed, along with all the students on campus, the passage of a UFO in broad daylight in 1967.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, he exhibited his work that a critic described as «a collision between Op art and archaeology». He was also a teacher, eventually teaching an evening class in Kensington called \"Earth mysteries\". Interested in researching the ideas behind ley lines, he took over as editor of \"The Ley Hunter\" magazine in 1976.\n\nDevereux is indelibly associated with “leys\", or “ley lines\". In 1976, Paul Devereux took over as editor of the magazine \"The Ley Hunter\". His first order was an article on the mystical power of ley lines, but none of the writers could provide concrete documentation on the matter. According to him, Alfred Watkins' alignments «were really just chance alignments of points on maps. This can be demonstrated quite conclusively».\n\nPaul Devereux' work on ley lines was mainly focused on debunking the mystical properties \"falsely\" attributed to them. He argues that fake information about ley lines started in 1936 with Dion Fortune's book \"Goat-Foot God\" where the author introduced the idea that ley lines have mystic power. He also mentions Aimé Michel's 1958 book, \"Flying Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery\", which stipulates that UFOs followed straight specific lines, an idea that ex-RAF pilot Tony Wedd later linked to Alfred Watkins' \"The Old Straight Track\". This idea then bloomed in the psychedelic movement of the 1960s and became a pillar of the New Age philosophies.\n\nAbout the Nazca Lines, Paul Devereux argues that they are walking tracks, and that their pattern mainly reveal the religious beliefs of the Kogi Indians around sacred roads. In his 2003 book \"Fairy Paths & Spirit Roads\", Paul Devereux studied many ley lines worldwide and concluded that these linear features are essentially «paths of spirits». He led the Dragon Project for 10 years and admitted that there are places of high radiation where some participants experienced powerful and vivid hallucinatory episodes of spirit-like visits.\n\nDevereux is the director of the Dragon Project Trust, which in the past used scientific measuring instruments as well as primary sensing (using dowsers and self-proclaimed psychics) to test modern rumours and traditional folklore of there being \"energies\" at sacred places. Between 1990 and 2000, it ran an ambitious ancient sites dream research programme (a modern, updated research version of ancient \"temple sleep\" practices).\n\nDevereux states that he suspects a small percentage of unexplained aerial phenomena are literally unexplained flying objects, their nature currently unknown. He strongly doubts they are extraterrestrial craft but rather exotic natural phenomena – probably some form of plasma with extraordinary properties. He coined the term “earth lights\" to label these type of phenomena. Most UFO sighting reports he thinks result from misperceptions of astronomical objects, atmospheric effects such as mirages, or aircraft and other mundane objects, or downright hoaxes. Some reports, he feels, also stem from psycho-social causes. Devereux states that he became interested in unexplained aerial phenomena because of a bizarre sighting of his own in 1967.\n\nDevereux has written three books on the topic, \"Earth Lights\", and, in particular, \"Earth Lights Revelation\", and has co-authored (with Peter Brookesmith) a major work, \"UFOs and Ufology\", and has also written numerous articles on earth lights and given several lectures (including at the Dana Centre, Science Museum, London) on the subject.\n\nIn 2014, the Landscape and Perception Project led by Paul Devereux led research on the rocks in Stonehenge and concluded they were resonant rocks that work like a giant prehistoric glockenspiel. This theory would explain why the rocks were brought from 200 miles away from the site.\n\nOther research led him to the observation that cairns on burial grounds resonate at 111 Hz (sacred resonance). According to him, Pythagoras created his accoustic scale starting with the sacred 111 Hz resonance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "646571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=646571", "title": "Performative utterance", "text": "Performative utterance\n\nIn the philosophy of language and speech acts theory, performative utterances are sentences which not only describe a given reality, but also change the social reality they are describing.\n\nIn his 1955 William James lecture series, which were later published under the title \"How to Do Things with Words\", J. L. Austin argued against a positivist philosophical claim that the utterances always \"describe\" or \"constate\" something and are thus always true or false. After mentioning several examples of sentences which are not so used, and not truth-evaluable (among them nonsensical sentences, interrogatives, directives and \"ethical\" propositions), he introduces \"performative\" sentences or illocutionary act as another instance.\n\nIn order to define performatives, Austin refers to those sentences which conform to the old prejudice in that they \"are\" used to describe or constate something, and which thus \"are\" true or false; and he calls such sentences \"constatives\". In contrast to them, Austin defines \"performatives\" as follows:\n\n\nFor example, when Paul says \"I promise to do the dishes\" in an appropriate context then he thereby does not just say something, and in particular he does not describe what he is doing; rather, in making the utterance he performs the promise; since promising is an illocutionary act, the utterance is thus a performative utterance. If Peter utters the sentence without the intention to keep the promise, or if eventually he does not keep it, then although something is not in order with the utterance, the problem is not that the sentence is false: it is rather \"unhappy\", or \"infelicitous\", as Austin also says in his discussion of so-called felicity conditions. In the absence of any such flaw, on the other hand, the utterance is to be assessed as \"happy\" or \"felicitous\", rather than as \"true\". Austin dropped this distinction in favour of a distinction between explicit performatives (\"I promise it will never happen again\") and primary or implicit performatives (\"It will never happen again,\" functioning as a promise).\n\nThe initial examples of performative sentences Austin gives are these:\n\nAs Austin later notices himself, these examples belong (more or less strikingly) to what Austin calls, \"explicit\" performatives; to utter an \"explicit\" performative sentence is to make explicit what act one is performing. However, there are also \"implicit\", \"primitive\", or \"inexplicit\" performatives. When, for instance, one uses the word \"Go!\" in order to command someone to leave the room then this utterance is part of the performance of a command; and the sentence, according to Austin, is neither true nor false; hence the sentence is a performative; – still, it is \"not\" an \"explicit\" performative, for it does not make explicit that the act the speaker is performing is a command.\n\nAs Austin observes, the acts purported to be performed by performative utterances may be socially contested. For instance, \"I divorce you\", said three times by a man to his wife, may be accepted to constitute a divorce by some, but not by others.\n\n\nJohn R. Searle argued in his 1989 article \"How Performatives Work\" that performatives are true/false just like constatives. Searle further claimed that performatives are what he calls \"declarations\"; this is a technical notion of Searle's account: according to his conception, an utterance is a \"declaration\", if \"the successful performance of the speech act is sufficient to bring about the fit between words and world, to make the propositional content true.\" Searle believes that this double direction of fit contrasts the simple word-to-world fit of assertives.\n\nBach and Harnish claimed that performatives are successful only if recipients infer the intention behind the literal meaning, and that therefore the success of the performative act is determined by the receiving side.\n\nEve Sedgwick argued that there are performative aspects to nearly all words, sentences, and phrases.\nAdditionally, according to Sedgwick, performative utterances can be 'transformative' performatives, which create an instant change of personal or environmental status, or 'promisory' performatives, which describe the world as it might be in the future. These categories are not exclusive, so an utterance may well have both qualities. As Sedgwick observes, performative utterances can be revoked, either by the person who uttered them (\"I take back my promise\"), or by some other party not immediately involved, like the state (for example, gay marriage vows pre-legalisation).\n\nWords on a list can be either descriptive or performative. 'Butter' on a shopping list implies that \"I will buy butter\" (a promise to yourself). But 'Butter' printed on your till receipt means \"you have purchased butter\" (simply a description).\n\nThe above ideas have influenced performative writing; they are used as a justification for an attempt to create a new form of critical writing about performance (often about performance art). Such a writing form is claimed to be, in itself, a form of performance. It is said to more accurately reflect the fleeting and ephemeral nature of a performance, and the various tricks of memory and referentiality that happen in the mind of the viewer during and after the performance.\n\n\n"}

Other issues related to political corruption or betrayal of public trust are lobbying, special interest groups and the public cartel.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"betrayal of public trust\" is one of the impeachable offenses. In \"Francisco, Jr. vs. Nagmamalasakit na mga Manananggol ng mga Manggagawang Pilipino, Inc.,\" the Supreme Court of the Philippines ruled that the definition of \"betrayal of public trust\" is \"a non-justiciable political question which is beyond the scope of its judicial power\" under the Constitution. It did not prescribe which branch of government has the power to define it, but implies that Congress, which handles impeachment cases, has the power to do so.\n\n"}

(RWN) is a national non-profit organization based in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. RWN works exclusively with refugee and immigrant women to enhance their strength, skills and courage through leadership training, education and advocacy.\n\nRWN was founded in 1995 by a group of women who have immigrated to the United States as refugees; a Vietnamese from Atlanta, a Laotian Hmong from Milwaukee, an Iranian from New York City and an Ethiopian from Los Angeles .They had experienced the refugee resettlement process and had worked in social service agencies that provided support to refugees. Through their collective experience, they knew that women’s skills, courage and experiences were not being adequately supported.\n\nRefugee Women's Network celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2015. The organization has continued to be relevant to new refugees.\n\nRefugee Women’s Network is a national non-profit organization created by women, for women, that focuses on enhancing refugee and immigrant women’s strengths, skills and courage through its leadership training, education and advocacy to promote independence, self-sufficiency and networking among its participants.\n\nThe goal of the Refugee Women's Network is to aid and inspire refugee women into becoming independent individuals and developing them into leaders within their families, businesses, and communities. \n\nThe Leadership Program is one of the oldest programs of RWN. Since 1995, 300 women in 30 American states from over 40 countries of origin have graduated from the leadership program. After participating in RWN's Leadership Program, many women have started their own organizations supporting refugees and immigrants in their communities. The Leadership Program is based on ‘Training for Transformation’, an approach to community development which focuses on \"responsible, ethical, inclusive\" methods of engaging community members. The leadership training gives participants tools and skills to understand, motivate and bring changes within themselves and their communities and the world. The goals of the Leadership Program are three-fold: strengthen women’s leadership abilities; increase their capacity to access community resources; and assist women to identify their values and build allies across ethnicity for advocacy.\n\nThe Health Promoters Program recruits refugees and immigrants from the Atlanta metropolitan area to become bicultural, bilingual bridges between their ethnic communities and the U.S. health care system. The project started in 2004 as a partnership with the DeKalb County Board of Health, Women Watch Afrika and RWN. Health promoters participate in 40 hours of training on health issues pertinent to their communities. RWN uses the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health, which includes physical, social, spiritual and mental well-being. Participants learn about topics such as nutrition, hygiene, mental health, reproductive health, physical health and adaptation of ethnic food to meet their current caloric needs. Following training, health promoters provide 12 hours of health education within their own ethnic communities each month and meet monthly for three hours of continuing education where they share stories, discuss community concerns and learn new information. The goals of the Health Promoters Program are: train women to be community health educators; provide health promoters with the resources to be liaisons between their ethnic communities and the health care system; and strengthen women's leadership abilities.\n\nThe Microenterprise Program was created in April 2001 in response to recurring requests for professional training and assistance to help refugee and immigrant women start or strengthen their own businesses. In 2005, RWN added a micro-lending component to the program, which gives loans between $250 and $15,000 to women entrepreneurs. The Microenterprise Program provides business development training, microloans, one-on-one business consultation and technical assistance to refugee and immigrant women who are working to start or strengthen their businesses. The goal of the Microenterprise and Microfinance Program is to help refugee and immigrant women and their families attain economic self-sufficiency through self-employment.\n\nThe Advocacy Program consists of RWN's continuous efforts to advocate on behalf of refugees, immigrants and women on a number of issues pertinent to their experiences. RWN participates in advocacy efforts on several national, state and local policy levels, taking part in initiatives representing the interest of refugee and immigrant women. These include inter-disciplinary initiatives like health, economic empowerment, housing and community development; creating a platform for the voices of refugees and immigrants; and empowering refugee and immigrant women to find their own voices.\n\n"}

Shaw\n\nStanford Jay Shaw (5 May 1930 – 16 December 2006) was an American historian, best known for his works on the late Ottoman Empire, Turkish Jews, and the early Turkish Republic. His works have been criticized by some scholars for containing errors, and he is considered an apologist for the Armenian genocide.\n\nStanford Jay Shaw was born to Belle and Albert Shaw, who had immigrated to St. Paul from England and Russia respectively in the early years of the twentieth century. Stanford Shaw and his parents moved to Los Angeles, California, in 1933 because of his father's illness, and they lived there until 1939, first in Hollywood, where Stanford went to kindergarten, and then in Ocean Park, a community on the shore of the Pacific Ocean between Santa Monica and Venice, where his parents operated a photographic shop on the Ocean Park pier. The family returned to St. Paul in 1939, where Stanford went to the Webster Elementary School. After his parents divorced, Stanford went with his mother to Akron, Ohio during World War II, where he went to elementary school. Stanford and his mother remained there until she married Irving Jaffey and moved back to St. Paul. Stanford then attended Mechanic Arts High School in St. Paul, where he graduated in 1947, one out of only five students from a student body of 500 who went to college.\n\nHe went on to Stanford University, where he majored in British history under the direction of Professor Carl Brand, with a minor in Near Eastern history, under the direction of Professor Wayne Vucinich. He received his B.A. at Stanford in 1951 and M.A. in 1952, with a thesis on the foreign policy of the British Labour Party from 1920–1938, based on research in the Hoover Institution at Stanford.\n\nHe then studied Middle Eastern history along with Arabic, Turkish and Persian as a graduate student at Princeton University starting in 1952, receiving his M.A. in 1955. Subsequently he went to England to study with Bernard Lewis and Paul Wittek at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London and with Professor H. A. R. Gibb at Oxford University.\n\nFollowing this, he went to Egypt to study with Shafiq Ghorbal and Adolph Grohmann at the University of Cairo and Shaikh Sayyid at the Azhar University, also doing research in the Ottoman archives of Egypt at the Citadel in Cairo for his Princeton Ph.D. dissertation concerning Ottoman rule in Egypt. Before leaving Egypt, he had a personal interview with President Gamal Abd al-Nasser, who arranged for him to take microfilms of Ottoman documents out of the country.\n\nIn 1956-7 he studied at the University of Istanbul with Professors Omer Lutfi Barkan, Mukrimin Halil Yinanc, Halil Sahillioglu, and Zeki Velidi Togan, also completing research on his dissertation in the Ottoman archives of Istanbul, where he was helped by a number of staff members, including Ziya Esrefoglu, Turgut Isiksal, Rauf Tuncay, and Attila Cetin, and in the Topkapi Palace archives, where he was provided with valuable assistance and support by its director, Hayrullah Ors and studied with Professor Ismail Hakki Uzuncarsili.\n\nHe received his Ph.D. degree in 1958 from Princeton University. His dissertation was titled \"The Financial and Administrative Organization and Development of Ottoman Egypt, 1517–1798,\" which was prepared under the direction of Professor Lewis Thomas and Professor Hamilton A.R. Gibb, and later published by the Princeton University Press in 1962. Stanford Shaw served as Assistant and Associate Professor of Turkish Language and History, with tenure, in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and in the Department of History at Harvard University from 1958 until 1968, and as Professor of Turkish history at the University of California Los Angeles from 1968 until his retirement in 1992.\n\nHe was recalled to teach Turkish history at UCLA between 1992 and 1997. His final post was at Bilkent University, Ankara as professor of Ottoman and Turkish history from 1999 to 2006.\n\nThe announcement of his death by his department at UCLA noted that his life was commemorated at Etz Ahayim Synagogue in Ortaköy, Istanbul, where his family accepted condolences from friends and colleagues and from Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gül and numerous other dignitaries and that he was buried at the Ashkenazi Cemetery in Ulus.\n\nHe was an honorary member of the Turkish Historical Society (Ankara), recipient of honorary degrees from Harvard University and the Boğaziçi University (Istanbul), and a member of the Middle East Studies Association, the American Historical Society, and the Tarih Vakfi (Istanbul). He also has received Order of Merit of the Republic of Turkey from the President of Turkey and medals for lifetime achievement from the Turkish-American Association and from the Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture (IRCICA) at the Yıldız Palace, Istanbul. He received two major research awards from the United States National Endowment from the Humanities as well as fellowships from the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Fulbright-Hayes Committee. He was also a Senior Fellow of the Institute of Turkish Studies.\n\nOne of Shaw's most prominent works was a two-volume history on the Ottoman Empire, titled \"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey\". The first volume, subtitled \"Empire of the Gazis: the Rise and Decline of the Ottoman Empire, 1280–1808\", published in 1976, was met with generally mixed to negative reviews. Many faulted him for producing a work embellished with numerous historical errors and distortions. Colin Imber, a scholar on Ottoman history, noted in his review that both volumes were \"so full of errors, half-truths, oversimplifications and inexactitudes that a non-specialist will find them positively misleading...When almost every page is a minefield of misinformation, a detailed review is impossible.\" Another reviewer, Victor L. Ménage, Professor of Turkish at the University of London, counted over 70 errors in the work and concluded, \"One 'prejudice' that has vanished in the process is the respect for accuracy, clarity, and reasoned judgment.\"\n\nIn his extensive review of the first volume, Speros Vryonis, a specialist in Byzantine and Early Ottoman Studies at UCLA, listed a litany of problems he encountered in the work, such as Shaw's assertion that Sultan Mehmed II's forces did not subject Constantinople to a full scale sack and massacre upon its capture and his account of the treatment of the Greeks of Cyprus following the Ottoman conquest in 1571. Vryonis also charged Shaw for largely failing to consult the proper primary sources of the period and therefore presenting a distorted picture of the formation of the Armenian and Greek/Eastern Orthodox \"millets\". More troubling allegations were put forward by Vryonis, when he accused the Shaw of wholesale plagiarism, claiming that as much as 90% of the first volume had been lifted from the works of two Turkish historians and a Turkish-language encyclopedia. Vryonis presented his findings to the administration at UCLA, but the university declined to carry out any further investigation into the matter.\n\nIn the second volume of the \"History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey\", which Shaw co-authored with his wife, Ezel Kural Shaw, and which was published in 1977 with the subtitle \"Reform, Revolution, and Republic: the Rise of Modern Turkey, 1808–1975\", the Shaws denied the Armenian Genocide. Most scholars today believe that the events of 1915 constitute genocide. However, according to Richard G. Hovannisian the Shaws characterize the Armenians as \"the victimizers rather than the victims, as the privileged rather than the oppressed, and the fabricators of unfounded tales of massacre.\" Hovannisian also criticized the book: \"What could have been – what should have been – a valuable text is instead an unfortunate example of nonscholarly selectivity and deceptive presentation.\" \n\nIn the bibliography of his general study on modern Turkey, Turkologist Eric J. Zürcher of the University of Leiden describes the second volume as \"a mine of data,\" though the information not necessarily being accurate. He highlighted the Shaws' treatment of the reigns of Selim III and Abdülhamit II as the book's strongest parts, but observed that the last one hundred years it covers suffers from a \"Turkish-nationalist bias.\"\n\nThe second volume caused a stir among Armenian students attending UCLA and the Armenian community of Los Angeles at large. Matters came to a head when on the night of 3 October 1977, a bomb, placed by unknown assailants, exploded at the doorstep of Shaw's home at 3:50 a.m., although no one was hurt. A phone call placed several hours later by a man claimed that the Iranian Group of 28 was responsible for the bombing. Turkey's permanent ambassador to the UN disputed this, however, and alleged that Armenians were behind the attack. Shaw made light of the situation and attributed the bombing to the fact that he had probably assigned too many F's. But he claimed that Armenian and Greek students had threatened him over the previous two years and canceled the rest of his classes for the remainder of the quarter. With the controversy unabated ten years later, Shaw would claim Armenians were persecuting him not because of his scholarly views but for anti-Semitism, a charge that was refuted by Jewish organizations, including the UCLA chapter of , on campus, as well as a number of Jewish public figures and scholars.\n\nIn 1991, Shaw's study on the role of Turkey in providing refuge to the Jews of Europe in the years leading to and during the Holocaust was published. Shaw claimed that the Republic of Turkey, as a neutral during the greater part of World War II, exerted its diplomatic efforts to the best of its abilities to save Jews of Turkish origins from extermination. The work was particularly receptive among Turkish government circles. It was, however, severely criticized by Bernard Wasserstein in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" for factual and methodological errors. Shaw's points have been challenged in a more recent study by Corry Guttstadt, who contests that his work has contributed to \"an ossified, self-perpetuating myth [of Turkish utilitarianism] which is frequently propagated in international publications,\" and that Turkey, in fact, passed laws that prevented Jewish immigration and threatened to expel refugee academics if they lacked proper documentation (after their citizenship had been revoked by Nazi Germany).\n\n\nIn addition to the above, Shaw was founder and first editor of the \"International Journal of Middle East Studies\", published by the Cambridge University Press for the Middle East Studies Association, from 1970 until 1980.\n\n"}

Much of the Musical Note pottery features incised zig-zag bands going around the pot, with punctures at the line segment junctions. The STK abandons incision in favor bands of small punctures, also in zig-zag patterns, with a vertical band dividing each angle. The effect is a band pattern of contiguous A-frames.\n\nWhere the Musical Note pottery expanded east over the Bug River, the STK moved down the Vistula and Elbe. The spread of this style must have been basically the transmission of cultural objects.\nThe homes of the STK people show a slight modification that became a major feature of later cultures: one end of the long house was made shorter than the other to achieve a trapezoidal shape. The reason for this modification remains obscure. Also, the STK people developed a preference for cremation rather than burial. The preceding early LBK had used both methods.\n\nAn unusual structure associated with STK has been found at Gosek, south of Berlin: a large, double concentric ring of post holes pierced by gates and surrounded by a circular ditch. The placement of the gates and some of the posts lead some investigators to hypothesize an observatory similar to Stonehenge, but in wood rather than stone; i.e., the posts mark some positions of celestial bodies.\n"}

{"id": "34341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34341", "title": "Year", "text": "Year\n\nA year is the orbital period of the Earth moving in its orbit around the Sun. Due to the Earth's axial tilt, the course of a year sees the passing of the seasons, marked by change in weather, the hours of daylight, and, consequently, vegetation and soil fertility. The current year is 2018.\n\nIn temperate and subpolar regions around the planet, four seasons are generally recognized: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In tropical and subtropical regions, several geographical sectors do not present defined seasons; but in the seasonal tropics, the annual wet and dry seasons are recognized and tracked.\n\nA calendar year is an approximation of the number of days of the Earth's orbital period as counted in a given calendar. The Gregorian calendar, or modern calendar, presents its calendar year to be either a common year of 365 days or a leap year of 366 days, as do the Julian calendars; \"see\" below. For the Gregorian calendar, the average length of the calendar year (the mean year) across the complete leap cycle of 400 years is 365.2425 days. The ISO standard ISO 80000-3, Annex C, supports the symbol \"a\" (for Latin \"annus\") to represent a year of either 365 or 366 days. In English, the abbreviations \"y\" and \"yr\" are commonly used.\n\nIn astronomy, the Julian year is a unit of time; it is defined as 365.25 days of exactly 86,400 seconds (SI base unit), totalling exactly 31,557,600 seconds in the Julian astronomical year.\n\nThe word \"year\" is also used for periods loosely associated with, but not identical to, the calendar or astronomical year, such as the seasonal year, the fiscal year, the academic year, etc. Similarly, \"year\" can mean the orbital period of any planet; for example, a Martian year and a Venusian year are examples of the time a planet takes to transit one complete orbit. The term can also be used in reference to any long period or cycle, such as the Great Year.\n\nEnglish \"year\" (via West Saxon \"ġēar\" (), Anglian \"ġēr\") continues Proto-Germanic \"*jǣran\" (\"*jē₁<nowiki>ran</nowiki>\").\nCognates are German \"Jahr\", Old High German \"jār\", Old Norse \"ár\" and Gothic \"jer\", from the Proto-Indo-European noun \"\" \"year, season\". Cognates also descended from the same Proto-Indo-European noun (with variation in suffix ablaut) are Avestan \"yārǝ\" \"year\", Greek (hṓra) \"year, season, period of time\" (whence \"hour\"), Old Church Slavonic \"jarŭ\", and Latin \"hornus\" \"of this year\". \n\nLatin \"annus\" (a 2nd declension masculine noun; \"annum\" is the accusative singular; \"annī\" is genitive singular and nominative plural; \"annō\" the dative and ablative singular) is from a PIE noun \"\", which also yielded Gothic \"aþn\" \"year\" (only the dative plural \"aþnam\" is attested).\n\nAlthough most languages treat the word as thematic \"*yeh₁r-o-\", there is evidence for an original derivation with an \"*-r/n\" suffix, \"*yeh₁-ro-\". Both Indo-European words for year, \"*yeh₁-ro-\" and \"*h₂et-no-\", would then be derived from verbal roots meaning \"to go, move\", \"*h₁ey-\" and \"*h₂et-\", respectively (compare Vedic Sanskrit \"éti\" \"goes\", \"atasi\" \"thou goest, wanderest\").\nA number of English words are derived from Latin \"annus\", such as annual, annuity, anniversary, etc.; \"per annum\" means \"each year\", \"anno Domini\" means \"in the year of the Lord\".\n\nThe Greek word for \"year\", , is cognate with Latin \"vetus\" \"old\", from the PIE word \"*wetos-\" \"year\", also preserved in this meaning in Sanskrit ' \"year\" and ' \"yearling (calf)\", the latter also reflected in Latin \"vitulus\" \"bull calf\", English \"wether\" \"ram\" (Old English \"weðer\", Gothic \"wiþrus\" \"lamb\").\n\nIn some languages, it is common to count years by referencing to one season, as in \"summers\", or \"winters\", or \"harvests\". Examples include Chinese 年 \"year\", originally 秂, an ideographic compound of a person carrying a bundle of wheat denoting \"harvest\". Slavic besides \"godŭ\" \"time period; year\" uses \"lěto\" \"summer; year\".\n\nIn the International System of Quantities (ISO 80000-3), the year (symbol, \"a\") is defined as either 365 days or 366 days.\n\nNo astronomical year has an integer number of days or lunar months, so any calendar that follows an astronomical year must have a system of intercalation such as leap years.\n\nIn the Julian calendar, the average (mean) length of a year is 365.25 days. In a non-leap year, there are 365 days, in a leap year there are 366 days. A leap year occurs every fourth year, or leap year, during which a leap day is intercalated into the month of February. The name \"Leap Day\" is applied to the added day.\n\nThe Revised Julian calendar, proposed in 1923 and used in some Eastern Orthodox Churches, \nhas 218 leap years every 900 years, for the average (mean) year length of days, close to the length of the mean tropical year, days (relative error of 9·10).\nIn the year 2800 CE, the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars will begin to differ by one calendar day.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar attempts to cause the northward equinox to fall on or shortly before March 21 and hence it follows the northward equinox year, or tropical year. Because 97 out of 400 years are leap years, the mean length of the Gregorian calendar year is days; with a relative error below one ppm (8·10) relative to the current length of the mean tropical year ( days) and even closer to the current \"March equinox year\" of days that it aims to match. It is estimated that by the year 4000 CE, the northward equinox will fall back by one day in the Gregorian calendar, not because of this difference, but due to the slowing of the Earth's rotation and the associated lengthening of the day.\n\nHistorically, lunisolar calendars intercalated entire leap months on an observational basis.\nLunisolar calendars have mostly fallen out of use except for liturgical reasons (Hebrew calendar, various Hindu calendars).\n\nA modern adaptation of the historical Jalali calendar, known as the Solar Hijri calendar (1925), is a purely solar calendar with an irregular pattern of leap days based on observation (or astronomical computation), aiming to place new year (Nowruz) on the day of vernal equinox (for the time zone of Tehran), as opposed to using an algorithmic system of leap years.\n\nA calendar era assigns a cardinal number to each sequential year, using a reference point in the past as the beginning of the era.\n\nThe worldwide standard is the Anno Domini era (but the label Common Era is preferred by some). It was historically introduced in the 6th century and intended as counting years from the birth of Jesus.\n\nThe Anno Domini era is given the Latin abbreviation AD (for Anno Domini \"in the year of the Lord\"), or alternatively CE for \"Common Era. Years before AD 1 are abbreviated BC for Before Christ or alternatively BCE for Before the Common Era.\nYear numbers are based on inclusive counting, so that there is no \"year zero\".\nIn the modern alternative reckoning of Astronomical year numbering, positive numbers indicate years AD, the number 0 designates 1 BC, −1 designates 2 BC, and so on.\n\nFinancial and scientific calculations often use a 365-day calendar to simplify daily rates.\n\nA fiscal year or financial year is a 12-month period used for calculating annual financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulations regarding accounting require such reports once per twelve months, but do not require that the twelve months constitute a calendar year.\n\nFor example, in Canada and India the fiscal year runs from April 1; in the United Kingdom it runs from April 1 for purposes of corporation tax and government financial statements, but from April 6 for purposes of personal taxation and payment of state benefits; in Australia it runs from July 1; while in the United States the fiscal year of the federal government runs from October 1.\n\nAn academic year is the annual period during which a student attends an educational institution. The academic year may be divided into academic terms, such as semesters or quarters. The school year in many countries starts in August or September and ends in May, June or July. In Israel the academic year begins around October or November, aligned with the second month of the Hebrew Calendar.\n\nSome schools in the UK and USA divide the academic year into \"three\" roughly equal-length terms (called \"trimesters\" or \"quarters\" in the USA), roughly coinciding with autumn, winter, and spring. At some, a shortened summer session, sometimes considered part of the regular academic year, is attended by students on a voluntary or elective basis. Other schools break the year into \"two\" main semesters, a first (typically August through December) and a second semester (January through May). Each of these main semesters may be split in half by mid-term exams, and each of the halves is referred to as a \"quarter\" (or \"term\" in some countries). There may also be a voluntary summer session and/or a short January session.\n\nSome other schools, including some in the United States, have \"four\" marking periods. Some schools in the United States, notably Boston Latin School, may divide the year into \"five or more\" marking periods. Some state in defense of this that there is perhaps a positive correlation between report frequency and academic achievement.\n\nThere are typically 180 days of teaching each year in schools in the US, excluding weekends and breaks, while there are 190 days for pupils in state schools in Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, and 200 for pupils in Australia.\n\nIn India the academic year normally starts from June 1 and ends on May 31. Though schools start closing from mid-March, the actual academic closure is on May 31 and in Nepal it starts from July 15.\n\nSchools and universities in Australia typically have academic years that roughly align with the calendar year (i.e., starting in February or March and ending in October to December), as the southern hemisphere experiences summer from December to February.\n\nThe Julian year, as used in astronomy and other sciences, is a time unit defined as exactly 365.25 days. This is the normal meaning of the unit \"year\" (symbol \"a\" from the Latin \"annus\") used in various scientific contexts. The Julian century of days and the Julian millennium of days are used in astronomical calculations. Fundamentally, expressing a time interval in Julian years is a way to precisely specify how many days (not how many \"real\" years), for long time intervals where stating the number of days would be unwieldy and unintuitive. By convention, the Julian year is used in the computation of the distance covered by a light-year.\n\nIn the Unified Code for Units of Measure, the symbol, \"a\" (without subscript), always refers to the Julian year, \"a\", of exactly seconds.\n\nThe SI multiplier prefixes may be applied to it to form \"ka\" (kiloannus), \"Ma\" (megaannus), etc.\n\nEach of these three years can be loosely called an \"astronomical year\".\n\nThe sidereal year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution of its orbit, as measured against a fixed frame of reference (such as the fixed stars, Latin \"sidera\", singular \"sidus\"). Its average duration is days (365 d 6 h 9 min 9.76 s) (at the epoch J2000.0 = January 1, 2000, 12:00:00 TT).\n\nToday the mean tropical year is defined as the period of time for the mean ecliptic longitude of the Sun to increase by 360 degrees. Since the Sun's ecliptic longitude is measured with respect to the equinox, the tropical year comprises a complete cycle of the seasons; because of the biological and socio-economic importance of the seasons, the tropical year is the basis of most calendars. The modern definition of mean tropical year differs from the actual time between passages of, e.g., the northward equinox for several reasons explained below. Because of the Earth's axial precession, this year is about 20 minutes shorter than the sidereal year. The mean tropical year is approximately 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 45 seconds, using the modern definition. (= days of 86400 SI seconds)\n\nThe anomalistic year is the time taken for the Earth to complete one revolution with respect to its apsides. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the perihelion, where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 3 in 2011), and the aphelion, where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 in 2011). The anomalistic year is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages. Its average duration is days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).\n\nThe draconic year, draconitic year, eclipse year, or ecliptic year is the time taken for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the same lunar node (a point where the Moon's orbit intersects the ecliptic). The year is associated with eclipses: these occur only when both the Sun and the Moon are near these nodes; so eclipses occur within about a month of every half eclipse year. Hence there are two eclipse seasons every eclipse year. The average duration of the eclipse year is\n\nThis term is sometimes erroneously used for the draconic or nodal period of lunar precession, that is the period of a complete revolution of the Moon's ascending node around the ecliptic: Julian years ( days; at the epoch J2000.0).\n\nThe full moon cycle is the time for the Sun (as seen from the Earth) to complete one revolution with respect to the perigee of the Moon's orbit. This period is associated with the apparent size of the full moon, and also with the varying duration of the synodic month. The duration of one full moon cycle is:\n\nThe lunar year comprises twelve full cycles of the phases of the Moon, as seen from Earth. It has a duration of approximately 354.37 days. Muslims use this for celebrating their Eids and for marking the start of the fasting month of Ramadan.\nA Muslim calendar year is based on the lunar cycle.\n\nThe vague year, from \"annus vagus\" or wandering year, is an integral approximation to the year equaling 365 days, which wanders in relation to more exact years. Typically the vague year is divided into 12 schematic months of 30 days each plus 5 epagomenal days. The vague year was used in the calendars of Ancient Egypt, Iran, Armenia and in Mesoamerica among the Aztecs and Maya. It is still used by many Zoroastrian communities.\n\nA heliacal year is the interval between the heliacal risings of a star. It differs from the sidereal year for stars away from the ecliptic due mainly to the precession of the equinoxes.\n\nThe Sothic year is the interval between heliacal risings of the star Sirius. It is currently less than the sidereal year and its duration is very close to the Julian year of 365.25 days.\n\nThe Gaussian year is the sidereal year for a planet of negligible mass (relative to the Sun) and unperturbed by other planets that is governed by the Gaussian gravitational constant. Such a planet would be slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's mean distance. Its length is:\n\nThe Besselian year is a tropical year that starts when the (fictitious) mean Sun reaches an ecliptic longitude of 280°. This is currently on or close to January 1. It is named after the 19th-century German astronomer and mathematician Friedrich Bessel. The following equation can be used to compute the current Besselian epoch (in years):\n\nThe TT subscript indicates that for this formula, the Julian date should use the Terrestrial Time scale, or its predecessor, ephemeris time.\n\nThe exact length of an astronomical year changes over time.\n\nMean year lengths in this section are calculated for 2000, and differences in year lengths, compared to 2000, are given for past and future years. In the tables a day is 86,400 SI seconds long.\n\nAn average Gregorian year is 365.2425 days (52.1775 weeks, hours, minutes or seconds). For this calendar, a common year is 365 days ( hours, minutes or seconds), and a leap year is 366 days ( hours, minutes or seconds). The 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar has days and hence exactly weeks.\n\nThe Great Year, or equinoctial cycle, corresponds to a complete revolution of the equinoxes around the ecliptic. Its length is about 25,700 years.\n\nThe Galactic year is the time it takes Earth's solar system to revolve once around the galactic center. It comprises roughly 230 million Earth years.\n\nA seasonal year is the time between successive recurrences of a seasonal event such as the flooding of a river, the migration of a species of bird, the flowering of a species of plant, the first frost, or the first scheduled game of a certain sport. All of these events can have wide variations of more than a month from year to year.\n\nIn the International System of Quantities the symbol for the year as a unit of time is \"a\", taken from the Latin word \"annus\".\n\nIn English, the abbreviations \"y\" or \"yr\" are more commonly used in non-scientific literature, but also specifically in geology and paleontology, where \"kyr, myr, byr\" (thousands, millions, and billions of years, respectively) and similar abbreviations are used to denote intervals of time remote from the present.\n\nNIST SP811 and ISO 80000-3:2006 support the symbol \"a\" as the unit of time for a year. In English, the abbreviations \"y\" and \"yr\" are also used.\n\nThe Unified Code for Units of Measure disambiguates the varying symbologies of ISO 1000, ISO 2955 and ANSI X3.50 by using:\n\nwhere:\n\nThe International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Geological Sciences have jointly recommended defining the annus, with symbol \"a\", as the length of the tropical year in the year 2000:\n\nThis differs from the above definition of 365.25 days by about 20 parts per million. The joint document says that definitions such as the Julian year \"bear an inherent, pre-programmed obsolescence because of the variability of Earth’s orbital movement\", but then proposes using the length of the tropical year as of 2000 AD (specified down to the millisecond), which suffers from the same problem. (The tropical year oscillates with time by more than a minute.)\n\nThe notation has proved controversial as it conflicts with an earlier convention among geoscientists to use \"a\" specifically for \"years ago\", and \"y\" or \"yr\" for a one-year time period.\n\nFor the following, there are alternative forms which elide the consecutive vowels, such as \"kilannus\", \"megannus\", etc. The exponents and exponential notations are typically used for calculating and in displaying calculations, and for conserving space, as in tables of data.\n\nIn astronomy, geology, and paleontology, the abbreviation \"yr\" for \"years\" and \"ya\" for years ago are sometimes used, combined with prefixes for thousand, million, or billion. They are not SI units, using \"y\" to abbreviate the English \"year\", but following ambiguous international recommendations, use either the standard English first letters as prefixes (t, m, and b) or metric prefixes (k, M, and G) or variations on metric prefixes (k, m, g). In archaeology, dealing with more recent periods, normally expressed dates, e.g. \"22,000 years ago\" may be used as a more accessible equivalent of a Before Present (\"BP\") date.\n\nThese abbreviations include:\nUse of \"mya\" and \"bya\" is deprecated in modern geophysics, the recommended usage being \"Ma\" and \"Ga\" for dates Before Present, but \"m.y.\" for the duration of epochs. This \"ad hoc\" distinction between \"absolute\" time and time intervals is somewhat controversial amongst members of the Geological Society of America.\n\nNote that on graphs, using \"ya\" units on the horizontal axis time flows from right to left, which may seem counter-intuitive. If the \"ya\" units are on the vertical axis, time flows from top to bottom which is probably easier to understand than conventional notation.\n\n\n"}
