{"id": "1897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1897", "title": "Australian English", "text": "Australian English\n\nAustralian English (AuE; en-AU) is the set of varieties of the English language native to Australia. Although English has no official status in the Constitution, Australian English is the country's national and \"de facto\" official language as it is the first language of the majority of the population.\n\nAustralian English began to diverge from British English after the First Settlers, who set up the Colony of New South Wales, arrived in 1788. By 1820, their speech was recognised as being different from British English. Australian English arose from the intermingling of early settlers, who were from a great variety of mutually intelligible dialectal regions of the British Isles, and quickly developed into a distinct variety of English which differs considerably from other varieties of English in vocabulary, accent, pronunciation, register, grammar and spelling.\n\nThe earliest form of Australian English was spoken by the children of the colonists in early New South Wales. This first generation of native-born children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation. The Australian-born children in the new colony were exposed to a wide range of dialects from all over the British Isles, in particular from Ireland and South East England.\n\nThe native-born children in the colony created the new dialect from the speech they heard around them, and with it expressed peer solidarity. Even when new settlers arrived, this new dialect was strong enough to blunt other patterns of speech.\n\nA quarter of the convicts were Irish. Many had been arrested in Ireland, and some in Great Britain. Many, if not most, of the Irish spoke Irish and either no English at all, or spoke it poorly and rarely. There were other significant populations of convicts from non-English speaking parts of Britain, such as the Scottish Highlands, Wales and parts of Cornwall.\n\nRecords from the early 19th century show this distinct dialect in the colonies after the first settlement in 1788. Peter Miller Cunningham's 1827 book \"Two Years in New South Wales\", described the distinctive accent and vocabulary of the native-born colonists, that differed from that of their parents and with a strong London influence. Anthony Burgess writes that \"Australian English may be thought of as a kind of fossilised Cockney of the Dickensian era.\"\nThe first of the Australian gold rushes, in the 1850s, began a large wave of immigration, during which about two per cent of the population of the United Kingdom emigrated to the colonies of New South Wales and Victoria. According to linguist Bruce Moore, \"the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing the Australian accent was from south-east England\".\n\nSome elements of Aboriginal languages have been adopted by Australian English—mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example dingo) and local culture. Many such are localised, and do not form part of general Australian use, while others, such as \"kangaroo\", \"boomerang\", \"budgerigar\", \"wallaby\" and so on have become international. Other examples are \"cooee\" and \"hard yakka\". The former is used as a high-pitched call, for attracting attention, (pronounced ) which travels long distances. \"Cooee\" is also a notional distance: \"if he's within cooee, we'll spot him\". \"Hard yakka\" means \"hard work\" and is derived from \"yakka\", from the Jagera/Yagara language once spoken in the Brisbane region.\n\nAlso of Aboriginal origin is the word \"bung\", from the Sydney pidgin English (and ultimately from the Sydney Aboriginal language), meaning \"dead\", with some extension to \"broken\" or \"useless\". Many towns or suburbs of Australia have also been influenced or named after Aboriginal words. The best-known example is the capital, Canberra, named after a local language word meaning \"meeting place\".\n\nAmong the changes starting in the 19th century were the introduction of words, spellings, terms and usages from North American English. The words imported included some later considered to be typically Australian, such as \"bushwhacker\" and \"squatter\".\nThis American influence continued with the popularity of American films and the influx of American military personnel in World War II; seen in the enduring persistence of such terms as \"okay\", \"you guys\" and \"gee\".\n\nThe primary way in which Australian English is distinctive from other varieties of English is through its unique pronunciation. It shares most similarity with other Southern Hemisphere accents, in particular New Zealand English. Like most dialects of English it is distinguished primarily by its vowel phonology.\n\nThe vowels of Australian English can be divided according to length. The long vowels, which include monophthongs and diphthongs, mostly correspond to the tense vowels used in analyses of Received Pronunciation (RP) as well as its centring diphthongs. The short vowels, consisting only of monophthongs, correspond to the RP lax vowels. There exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving Australian English phonemic length distinction, which is unusual amongst the various dialects of English, though not unknown elsewhere, such as in regional south-eastern dialects of the UK and eastern seaboard dialects in the US. As with New Zealand English, the weak-vowel merger is complete in Australian English: unstressed is merged into (schwa), unless it is followed by a velar consonant.\n\nThere is little variation in the sets of consonants used in different English dialects but there are variations in how these consonants are used. Australian English is no exception.\n\nAustralian English is non-rhotic; that is, the sound does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant. However, a linking can occur when a word that has a final <r> in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel. An intrusive may similarly be inserted before a vowel in words that do not have <r> in the spelling in certain environments, namely after the long vowel and after word final . This can be heard in \"law-r-and order,\" where an intrusive R is voiced after the W and before the A.\n\nThere is some degree of allophonic variation in the alveolar stops. As with North American English, Intervocalic alveolar flapping is a feature of Australian English: prevocalic and surface as the alveolar tap after sonorants other than as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel in the same breath group. For many speakers, and in the combinations and -are also palatalised, thus and , as Australian is only very slightly retroflex, the tip remaining below the level of the bottom teeth in the same position as for ; it is also somewhat rounded (\"to say 'r' the way Australians do you need to say 'w' at the same time\"), where older English and have fallen together as . The wine–whine merger is complete in Australian English.\n\n\"Yod\"-dropping occurs after , and, . Other cases of and , along with and , have coalesced to , , and respectively for many speakers. is generally retained in other consonant clusters.\n\nIn common with most varieties of Scottish English and American English, the phoneme is pronounced as a \"dark\" (velarised) L () in all positions, unlike other dialects such as Received Pronunciation and Hiberno (Irish) English, where a light L (i.e., a non-velarised L) is used in many positions.\n\nDifferences in stress, weak forms and standard pronunciation of isolated words occur between Australian English and other forms of English, which while noticeable do not impair intelligibility.\n\nThe affixes \"-ary\", \"-ery\", \"-ory\", \"-bury\", \"-berry\" and \"-mony\" (seen in words such as \"necessary, mulberry\" and \"matrimony\") can be pronounced either with a full vowel or a schwa. Although some words like \"necessary\" are almost universally pronounced with the full vowel, older generations of Australians are relatively likely to pronounce these affixes with a schwa while younger generations are relatively likely to use a full vowel.\n\nWords ending in unstressed \"-ile\" derived from Latin adjectives ending in \"-ilis\" are pronounced with a full vowel (), so that \"fertile\" rhymes with \"fur tile\" rather than \"turtle\".\n\nIn addition, miscellaneous pronunciation differences exist when compared with other varieties of English in relation to seemingly random words. For example, as with American English, the vowel in \"yoghurt\" is pronounced as (\"long 'O'\") rather than (\"short o\"); \"vitamin\", \"migraine\" and \"privacy\" are pronounced with (as in \"mine\") rather than , and respectively; \"paedophile\" is pronounced with (as in \"red\") rather than ; and \"urinal\" is pronounced with schwa rather than (\"long i\"). As with British English, \"advertisement\" is pronounced with ; \"tomato\" and \"vase\" are pronounced with (as in \"father\") instead of ; \"zebra\" is pronounced with (as in \"red\") rather than ; and \"buoy\" is pronounced as (as in \"boy\") rather than . Two examples of miscellaneous pronunciations which contrast with both standard American and British usages are \"data\", which may be pronounced with (\"dah\") instead of (\"day\"); and \"maroon\", pronounced with (\"own\") as opposed to (\"oon\").\n\nAcademic research has shown that the most notable variation within Australian English is largely sociocultural. This is mostly evident in phonology, which is divided into three sociocultural varieties: \"broad\", \"general\" and \"cultivated\".\n\nA limited range of word choices is strongly regional in nature. Consequently, the geographical background of individuals can be inferred, if they use words that are peculiar to particular Australian states or territories and, in some cases, even smaller regions.\n\nIn addition, some Australians speak creole languages derived from Australian English, such as Australian Kriol, Torres Strait Creole and Norfuk.\n\nThe \"broad\", \"general\" and \"cultivated\" accents form a continuum that reflects minute variations in the Australian accent. They can reflect the social class, education and urban or rural background of speakers, though such indicators are not always reliable. According to linguists, the general Australian variant emerged some time before 1900. Recent generations have seen a comparatively smaller proportion of the population speaking with the broad variant, along with the near extinction of the cultivated Australian accent. The growth and dominance of general Australian accents perhaps reflects its prominence on radio and television during the late 20th century.\n\nAustralian Aboriginal English is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of Australia, and are said to vary along a continuum, from forms close to Standard Australian English to more non-standard forms. There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use.\n\nThe ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in Australian English that are spoken by the minority groups, which are of non-English speaking background. A massive immigration from Asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the Australian context. These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General Australian English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-English language features, such as the Afro-Asiatic and Asian languages.\n\nAlthough Australian English is relatively homogeneous, there are some regional variations. The dialects of English spoken in South Australia, Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland and the Torres Strait Islands differ slightly in vocabulary and phonology.\n\nMost regional differences are in word usage. Swimming clothes are known as \"cossies\" or \"swimmers\" in New South Wales, \"togs\" in Queensland, and \"bathers\" in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia. What most of Australia calls a \"stroller\" is usually called a \"pram\" in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. Preference for some synonymous words also differ between states. \"Garbage\" (i.e., garbage bin, garbage truck) dominates over \"rubbish\" in New South Wales and Queensland, while \"rubbish\" is more popular in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia. The word \"footy\" generally refers to the most popular football code in an area; that is, rugby league or rugby union depending on the local area, in most of New South Wales and Queensland, and Australian rules football elsewhere. Beer glasses are also named differently in different states. Distinctive grammatical patterns exist such as the use of the interrogative \"eh\" (also spelled \"ay\" or \"aye\"), which is particularly associated with Queensland.\n\nThere are some notable regional variations in the pronunciations of certain words. The trap‑bath split is more complete in South Australia, which had a different settlement chronology and type from other parts of the country. This resulted in a British English influence that lasted longer that of the other colonies. Words such as \"dance\", \"advance\", \"plant\", \"graph\", \"example\" and \"answer\" are pronounced with (as in \"father\") far more frequently in South Australia while elsewhere in Australia the older (as in \"mad\") is more common. \"L\"-vocalisation is also more common in South Australia than other states. In Western Australian and Queensland English, the vowels in \"near\" and \"square\" are typically realised as centring diphthongs (\"nee-ya\"), whereas in the other states they may also be realised as monophthongs. A feature common in Victorian English is salary–celery merger, whereby a Victorian pronunciation of \"Ellen\" may sound like \"Alan\" to speakers from other states. There is also regional variation in before (as in \"school\" and \"pool\").\n\nAustralian English has many words and idioms which are unique to the dialect and have been written on extensively, with the \"Macquarie Dictionary\", widely regarded as the national standard, incorporating numerous Australian terms.\n\nInternationally well-known examples of Australian terminology include \"outback\", meaning a remote, sparsely populated area, \"the bush\", meaning either a native forest or a country area in general, and \"g'day\", a greeting. \"Dinkum\", or \"fair dinkum\" means \"true\" or \"is that true?\", among other things, depending on context and inflection. The derivative \"dinky-di\" means \"true\" or devoted: a \"dinky-di Aussie\" is a \"true Australian\".\n\nAustralian poetry, such as \"The Man from Snowy River\", as well as folk songs such as \"Waltzing Matilda\", contain many historical Australian words and phrases that are understood by Australians even though some are not in common usage today.\n\nAustralian English, in common with several British English dialects (for example, Cockney, Scouse, Glaswegian and Geordie), uses the word \"mate\". Many words used by Australians were at one time used in the United Kingdom but have since fallen out of usage or changed in meaning there.\n\nFor example, \"creek\" in Australia, as in North America, means a stream or small river, whereas in the UK it means a small watercourse flowing into the sea; \"paddock\" in Australia means field, whereas in the UK it means a small enclosure for livestock; \"bush\" or \"scrub\" in Australia, as in North America, means a wooded area, whereas in England they are commonly used only in proper names (such as Shepherd's Bush and Wormwood Scrubs).\n\nLitotes, such as \"not bad\", \"not much\" and \"you're not wrong\", are also used, as are diminutives, which are commonly used and are often used to indicate familiarity. Some common examples are \"arvo\" (afternoon), \"barbie\" (barbecue), \"smoko\" (cigarette break), \"Aussie\" (Australian) and \"pressie\" (present/gift). This may also be done with people's names to create nicknames (other English speaking countries create similar diminutives). For example, \"Gazza\" from Gary, or \"Smitty\" from John Smith. The use of the suffix \"-o\" originates in Irish Gaelic (Irish \"ó\"), which is both a postclitic and a suffix with much the same meaning as in Australian English.\n\nIn informal speech, incomplete comparisons are sometimes used, such as \"sweet as\" (as in \"That car is sweet as.\"). \"Full\", \"fully\" or \"heaps\" may precede a word to act as an intensifier (as in \"The waves at the beach were heaps good.\"). This was more common in regional Australia and South Australia but has been in common usage in urban Australia for decades. The suffix \"-ly\" is sometimes omitted in broader Australian English. For instance, \"really good\" can become \"real good\".\n\nAustralia's switch to the metric system in the 1970s changed most of the country's vocabulary of measurement from imperial to metric measures. Since the switch to metric, heights of individuals are listed in centimetres on official documents such as a driver's licence but older people understand and may speak of feet and inches.\n\nWhere British and American vocabulary differs, Australians sometimes favour a usage different from both varieties, as with footpath (for US sidewalk, UK pavement), capsicum (for US bell pepper, UK green/red pepper), or doona (for US comforter, UK duvet) from a trademarked brand. In other instances, it either shares a term with American English, as with truck (UK: lorry) or eggplant (UK: aubergine), or with British English, as with mobile phone (US: cell phone) or bonnet (US: hood).\n\nA non-exhaustive selection of common British English terms not commonly used in Australian English include (Australian usage in brackets): artic/articulated lorry (semi-trailer); aubergine (eggplant); bank holiday (public holiday); bedsit (one-bedroom apartment); bin lorry (garbage truck); cagoule (raincoat); candy floss (fairy floss); cash machine (automatic teller machine/ATM); child-minder (babysitter); chivvy (nag); clingfilm (glad wrap/cling wrap); cooker (stove); courgette (zucchini); skive (wag); dungarees (overalls); dustbin (garbage/rubbish bin); dustcart (garbage/rubbish truck); duvet (doona); elastoplast/plaster (band-aid); estate car (station wagon); fairy cake (cupcake/patty cake); free phone (toll-free); football (soccer); full fat milk (full-cream milk); goose bumps (goose pimples); high street (main street); hoover (\"v\" - to vacuum); horsebox (horse float); ice lolly (ice block/icy pole); kitchen roll (paper towel); lorry (truck); marrow (squash); nettled (irritated); off-licence (bottle shop); pavement (footpath); potato crisps (potato chips); red/green pepper (capsicum); pilchard (sardine); pillar box (post box); plimsoll (sandshoe); pushchair (pram/stroller); saloon car (sedan); snog (\"v\" - kiss); swan (\"v\" - to go somewhere in an ostentatious way); sweets (lollies); tangerine (mandarin); utility room (laundry); Wellington boots (gumboots).\n\nA non-exhaustive list of American English terms not commonly found in Australian English include: acclimate (acclimatise); aluminum (aluminium); bangs (fringe); bell pepper (capsicum); bellhop (hotel porter); broil (grill); burglarize (burgle); busboy (included under the broader term of waiter); candy (lollies); cell phone (mobile phone); cilantro (coriander); comforter (doona); counter-clockwise (anticlockwise); diaper (nappy); downtown (CBD); drywall (plasterboard); emergency brake (handbrake); faucet (tap); flashlight (torch); frosting (icing); gasoline (petrol); golden raisin (sultana); hood (bonnet); jell-o (jelly); jelly (jam); math (maths); nightstand (bedside table); pacifier (dummy); period (full stop); parking lot (car park); popsicle (ice block/icy pole); railway ties (sleepers); rear view mirror (rear vision mirror); row house (terrace house); scallion (spring onion); silverware/flatware (cutlery); stickshift (manual transmission); streetcar (tram); takeout (takeaway); trash can (garbage/rubbish bin); trunk (boot); turn signal (indicator/blinker); vacation (holiday); upscale/downscale (upmarket/downmarket); windshield (windscreen).\n\nTerms shared by British and American English but not so commonly found in Australian English include: abroad (overseas); cooler/ice box (Esky); flip-flops (thongs); pickup truck (ute); wildfire (bushfire).\n\nAustralian English is particularly divergent from other varieties with respect to geographical terminology, due to the country's unique geography. This is particularly true when comparing with British English, due to that country's dramatically different geography. British geographical terms not in common use in Australia include: coppice (cleared bushland); dell (valley); fen (swamp); heath (shrubland); meadow (grassy plain); moor (swampland); spinney (shrubland); stream (creek); woods (bush) and village (even the smallest settlements in Australia are called \"towns\" or \"stations\").\n\nIn addition, a number of words in Australian English have different meanings from those ascribed in other varieties of English. Clothing-related examples are notable. \"Pants\" in Australian English follows American usage in refer to British English \"trousers\" but in British English refer to Australian English \"underpants\"; \"vest\" in Australian English pass also in American refers to British English \"waistcoat\" but in British English refers to Australian English \"singlet\"; \"thong\" in both American and British English refers to underwear (otherwise known as a G-string), while in Australian English it refers to British and American English \"flip-flop\" (footwear). There are numerous other examples, including \"biscuit\" which refers in Australian and British English to what in American English is \"cookie\" or \"cracker\" but to a savoury cake in American English; \"Asian\", which in Australian and American English commonly refers to people of East Asian heritage, as opposed to British English, in which it commonly refers to people of South Asian descent; and \"(potato) chips\" which refers both to British English \"crisps\" (which is not commonly used in Australian English) and to American English \"French fries\" (which is used alongside \"hot chips\").\n\nIn addition to the large number of uniquely Australian idioms in common use, there are instances of idioms taking differing forms in the various Anglophone nations, for example \"home away from home\", \"take with a grain of salt\" and \"wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole\" (which in British English take the respective forms \"home from home\", \"take with a pinch of salt\" and \"wouldn't touch with a barge pole\"), or \"a drop in the ocean\" and \"touch wood\" (which in American English take the forms \"a drop in the bucket\" and \"knock on wood\").\n\nAs with American English, but unlike British English, collective nouns are almost always singular in construction, e.g., \"the government was unable to decide\" as opposed to \"the government were unable to decide\". \"Shan't\", the use of \"should\" as in \"I should be happy if ...\", the use of \"haven't any\" instead of \"haven't got any\" and the use of \"don't let's\" in place of \"let's not\", common in upper-register British English, are almost never encountered in Australian (or North American) English. \"River\" generally follows the name of the river in question as in North America, i.e., \"Darling River\", rather than the British convention of coming before the name, e.g., \"River Thames\". In South Australia however, the British convention applies—for example, the \"River Murray\" or the \"River Torrens\". As with American English, \"on the weekend\" and \"studied medicine\" are used rather than the British \"at the weekend\" and \"read medicine\". Similarly, \"around\" is more commonly used in constructions such as \"running around\", \"stomping around\" or \"messing around\" in contrast with the British convention of using \"about\".\n\nIn common with British English, the past tense and past participles of the verbs \"learn\", \"spell\" and \"smell\" are often irregular (\"learnt\", \"spelt\", \"smelt\"). Similarly, in Australian usage, the \"to\" in \"I'll write to you\" is retained, as opposed to US usage where it may be dropped. While prepositions before days may be omitted in American English, i.e., \"She resigned Thursday\", they are retained in Australian English, as in British English: \"She resigned on Thursday\". Ranges of dates use \"to\", i.e., \"Monday to Friday\", as with British English, rather than \"Monday through Friday\" in American English. When saying or writing out numbers, \"and\" is inserted before the tens and units, i.e., \"one hundred and sixty-two\", as with British practice. However Australians, like Americans, are more likely to pronounce numbers such as 1,200 as \"twelve hundred\", rather than \"one thousand two hundred\".\n\nAs in most English-speaking countries, there is no official governmental regulator or overseer of correct spelling and grammar. The \"Macquarie Dictionary\" is used by some universities and some other organisations as a standard for Australian English spelling. The \"Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers\", the \"Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage\" and the \"Australian Guide to Legal Citation\" are prominent style guides.\n\nAustralian spelling is closer to British than American spelling. As with British spelling, the \"u\" is retained in words such as \"colour\", \"honour\", \"labour\" and \"favour\". While the Macquarie Dictionary lists the \"-our\" ending and follows it with the \"-or\" ending as an acceptable variant, the latter is rarely found in actual use today. Australian print media, including digital media, today strongly favour \"-our\" endings. A notable exception to this rule is the Australian Labor Party, which adopted the American spelling in 1912 as a result of \"-or\" spellings' comparative popularity at that time. Consistent with British spellings, \"-re\", rather than \"-er\", is the only listed variant in Australian dictionaries in words such as \"theatre\", \"centre\" and \"manoeuvre\". Unlike British English, which is split between \"-ise\" and \"-ize\" in words such as \"organise\" and \"realise\", with \"-ize\" favoured by the Oxford English Dictionary and \"-ise\" listed as a variant, \"-ize\" is rare in Australian English and designated as a variant by the Macquarie Dictionary. \"Ae\" and \"oe\" are often maintained in words such as \"manoeuvre\", \"paedophilia\" and \"foetus\" (excepting those listed below); however, the Macquarie dictionary lists forms with \"e\" (e.g., pedophilia, fetus) as acceptable variants and notes a tendency within Australian English towards using only \"e\". Individual words where the preferred spelling is listed by the Macquarie Dictionary as being different from the British spellings include \"program\" (in all contexts) as opposed to \"programme\", \"inquire\" and derivatives \"inquired\", \"inquiry\", etc. as opposed to \"enquire\" and derivatives, \"analog\" (as opposed to digital) as opposed to \"analogue\", \"livable\" as opposed to \"liveable\", \"guerilla\" as opposed to \"guerrilla\", \"yoghurt\" as opposed to \"yogurt\", \"verandah\" as opposed to \"veranda\", \"burqa\" as opposed to \"burka\", \"pastie\" (food) as opposed to \"pasty\". Unspaced prepositions such as \"onto\", \"anytime\", \"alright\" and \"anymore\" are also listed as being equally as acceptable as their spaced counterparts.\n\nDifferent spellings have existed throughout Australia's history. A pamphlet entitled \"The So-Called \"American Spelling\"\", published in Sydney some time in the 19th century, argued that \"there is no valid etymological reason for the preservation of the \"u\" in such words as \"honor\", \"labor\", etc.\" The pamphlet also claimed that \"the tendency of people in Australasia is to excise the u, and one of the Sydney morning papers habitually does this, while the other generally follows the older form.\" What are today regarded as American spellings were popular in Australia throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the Victorian Department of Education endorsing them into the 1970s and \"The Age\" newspaper until the 1990s. This influence can be seen in the spelling of the Australian Labor Party and also in some place names such as Victor Harbor. The \"Concise Oxford English Dictionary\" has been attributed with re-establishing the dominance of the British spellings in the 1920s and 1930s. For a short time during the late 20th century, Harry Lindgren's 1969 spelling reform proposal (\"Spelling Reform 1\" or \"SR1\") gained some support in Australia: in 1975, the Australian Teachers' Federation adopted SR1 as a policy. SR1 calls for the short sound (as in \"bet\") to be spelt with E (for example \"friend→frend, head→hed\").\n\nBoth single and double quotation marks are in use (with double quotation marks being far more common in print media), with logical (as opposed to typesetter's) punctuation. Spaced and unspaced em-dashes remain in mainstream use, as with American and Canadian English. The DD/MM/YYYY date format is followed and the 12-hour clock is generally used in everyday life (as opposed to service, police, and airline applications).\n\nThere are two major English language keyboard layouts, the United States layout and the United Kingdom layout. Australia universally uses the United States keyboard layout, which lacks pound sterling, Euro currency and negation symbols. Punctuation symbols are also placed differently from British keyboards.\n\n\n"}

It was prepared by Friedrich Engels from notes left by Karl Marx and published in 1894. \n\nVolume III is in seven parts:\n\n\nThe work is best known today for part 3, which in summary says that as the organic fixed capital requirements of production rise as a result of advancements in production generally, the rate of profit tends to fall. This result, which orthodox Marxists believe is a principal contradictory characteristic leading to an inevitable collapse of the capitalist order, was held by Marx and Engels to, as a result of various contradictions in the capitalist mode of production, result in crises whose resolution necessitates the emergence of an entirely new mode of production as the culmination of the same historical dialectic that led to the emergence of capitalism from prior forms.\n\nVolume 3 is subtitled \"The process of capitalist production as a whole\" and is concerned primarily with the internal differentiation of the capitalist class. The first three parts are concerned with the division of surplus value amongst individual capitals, where it takes the form of profit. The following parts are concerned with merchants' capital, interest-bearing capital and landed capital. The last part draws the whole account together. The aim of the volume as a whole is to 'locate and describe the concrete forms which grow out of the movements of capital as a whole...The various forms of capital,\nas evolved in this book, thus approach step by step the form which they assume on the surface of society, in the action of different capitals on one another in competition, and in the ordinary consciousness of the agents of production themselves.\" (25) (Clarke).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27604419", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27604419", "title": "Class-size reduction", "text": "Class-size reduction\n\nAs an education reform, the broad goal of class size reduction (CSR) is to increase the number of individualized student-teacher interactions intended to improve student learning. A reform long holding theoretical attraction to many constituencies, some have claimed CSR as the most studied educational reform of the last century. Until recently, interpretations of these studies have often been contentious. Some educational groups like the American Federation of Teachers and National Education Association are in favor of reducing class sizes. Others argue that class size reduction has little effect on student achievement. Many are concerned about the costs of reducing class sizes.\n\nThe two most prominent CSR studies are Project STAR, which was conducted in the mid- to late-80s in Tennessee and Project SAGE, conducted in the early 2000s in Wisconsin. Studies following the work of Project STAR and SAGE found that, even when reintroduced to larger class-sizes later in their educational career, the positive foundation for learning caused students to later in life to be more likely to take advanced classes, graduate from high school, attend college, and major in a STEM field.\n\nSubsequent research on the effects of class size reduction has linked small class sizes with a variety of cognitive and non-cognitive benefits for students and teachers, both short and long-term, especially when class sizes are reduced in the early grades (K-3). Its benefits are particularly pronounced for lower-income students and children of color, who experience two to three times the gains from smaller classes, leading CSR to be one of only a few education reforms proven to reduce the achievement gap. Smaller classes have also been found to have a positive impact on school climate, student socio-emotional growth, safety and suspension rates, parent engagement, and teacher attrition, especially in schools with large numbers of disadvantaged children.\n\nAn early complication in measuring the efficacy of class size reduction was the tendency for different ideological camps to use different definitions of \"class size\" in the literature. As a direct measure of the number of students in each class, \"group size\" is currently understood by the educational community to be the best measure of a teacher's \"true opportunity to build direct relationships with each student.\" A more malleable definition and one now held in dubious regard, \"pupil to teacher ratio,\" would declare a situation in which one teacher leads a class while another does paperwork in the back but does not interact with students as being half as large as its group size.\n\nIn the past, depending on which measure was used, researchers tended toward far different interpretations of the benefits of class size reduction leading to far different recommendations for implementation. In 2002, Margaret Spellings, secretary of education under President George W. Bush, pointed out the need for a standardized definition of what is meant by class size.\n\nTo differentiate student-teacher ratio and class size, it is important to know several key distinctions. Class size, generally speaking, refers to the average class size in a given grade level of a given school. Student-teacher ratios, normally, are calculated by taking the total number of teachers at a given school divided by the complete enrollment of that school. This distinction is significant, because the ratio will not always match up with the class size figure (or vice versa). For example, a student-teacher ratio may be small but a class size may be larger than what the student-teacher ratio leads one to believe.\n\nAware of both the preliminary results of a CSR program in Indiana called Project Prime Time and the potential large scale costs of additional classrooms and teachers, in 1985, under then Governor Lamar Alexander, Tennessee began a three-phase project to determine the effects of reduced class sizes on short and long term pupil performance in the earliest grades.\n\nThe first phase, termed Project STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio), randomly assigned teachers and students to three groups, “small” (13 to 17), “regular” (22 to 25) classes with a paid aide, and “regular” (22 to 25) classes with no aide. In total some 6,500 students in about 330 classrooms at approximately 80 schools participated.\n\nUsing both standardized and curriculum based testing, the initial study concluded that small classes produced “substantial improvement in early learning and cognitive studies” with the effect about double for minority students. As this is considered the seminal study (in an area that has received much political attention) there have been many attempts to reinterpret the data.\n\nDubbed the Lasting Benefits Study, the second phase began in 1989 and sought to determine whether the benefits of CSR persisted into upper grades when all students entered standard size classes. Observations confirmed that children originally enrolled in smaller classes continued to outperform their peers when they returned to regular-sized classrooms. These results were deemed true for all types of classes and all types of cities (rural, suburban, and metropolitan).\n\nUnder the third phase, Project Challenge, the 17 economically poorest school districts were adequately funded to provide smaller class sizes for their K-3 students. These districts improved their end-of-year- standing (among 139 districts) in mathematics and reading from below average to above average.\n\nDr. Eric Hanushek has called into question the validity of the study on Project STAR, arguing that the bulk of scientific research on small-class sizes shows no or statistically insignificant effects and that there must be another explanation, like flawed random assignment, that produced the result rather than small class size. However, subsequent research has disproven Hanushek's claim that \"there is no strong or consistent relationship between school inputs and student performance\". Dr. Alan Krueger reanalyzed the data on which Hanushek based this claim and found that Hanushek \"places a disproportionate share of weight on a small number of studies that frequently used small samples and estimated misspecified models.\" When this is corrected, the literature actually reveals a strong correlation between reduced class size and academic performance and suggests that the internal rate of return from reducing class size from 22 to 15 students is around 6 percent. It should be noted that, in more recent years, Hanushek has defended his work in his book \"Money Might Matter Somewhere\", in which he argues that the amount of money spent per pupil is not as important a factor towards student achievement inasmuch as how the money is spent. In other words, Hanushek argues that giving a student $10,000 worth of pens and pencils would not impact their overall student achievement as much as, say, a $10,000 investment into training and development for that student's teacher.\n\nIn 2002 the state of Wisconsin began its own investigations into “the wisdom of class size reduction,\" by initiating Project SAGE (Student Achievement Guarantee in Education). In all, nine low income schools were studied, their locations spanning urban, semi-urban, and rural geographies. Evaluation included site visits, standardized assessments, collection of curriculum, and interviews with teachers, principals, and students.\n\nThe guiding assumptions of the study were:\n\n(1) Class size implementation alone is insufficient to promote student achievement. Changes in teaching methods that take full advantage of smaller class sizes will also be needed.\n\n(2) Class size reduction may have unintended consequences.\n\n(3) Generalization requires careful adaptation. Every classroom has a unique and specific context.\n\nOne primary difficulty encountered by the SAGE project was the availability of funds for teachers but not space. Each district was then left to this potential problem in their own unique way. In schools constrained by space this often involved tag-team teaching rather than increased individualized instruction (lowering of PTR but not class size).\n\nResults from the study demonstrated increased teacher satisfaction with job, increased communication with parents, and (as with Project STAR) long term increases in student graduation rates and admission into college. Although no significant differences were observed in the gains of both male and female students, improved outcomes were again larger amongst minority and disadvantaged students.\n\nProject PRIME TIME was proposed in 1981 by former Indiana Governor Robert D. Orr. The intent was to upgrade the quality of early school experiences by reducing class sizes. The Indiana General Assembly appropriated $300,000 for the 1981–82 and 1982-82 school years to pilot PRIME TIME in nine schools, grades K-3, across Indiana. In 1983, the General Assembly increased PRIME TIME's funding for 1983-84 and 1984-85 to $2 million. This increased funding allowed for PRIME TIME's expansion in first grade. The program was expanded to second grade in 1985 and by the fall of 1987, it covered kindergarten through third grade.\n\nResults from the study showed: \n\nIn a British study, students were closely observed by teams of researchers who recorded their “moment to moment” behaviors in blocks of 10-second intervals. The researchers found that adding five students to a class decreased the odds of students’ being on task by nearly a quarter. In classes of 30, low-attaining students were nearly twice as likely to be disengaged as they were in classes of 15.\n\nContrary to some class-size studies conducted in the United States, the British researchers found no “threshold effect” in their study. In other words, classes did not have to be reduced to 15 or 20 students before the behavioral benefits started to kick in. Reducing class size at any end of the class-size spectrum seemed to help.\n\nThe California K–3 CSR Program was established in 1996 to improve education, especially in reading and mathematics, by reducing class sizes in kindergarten through grade three. The K–3 CSR Program provided funds to public and charter schools that reduced their class sizes to 20 pupils per certified teacher, rewarding each school with $850 per student that was in one of these smaller classes. As a result, the program was consuming 6% of the state's general education budget by 2001 and had, thus far, cost a total of $22 billion.\n\nThere has been a lot of controversy surrounding the program, with some critics arguing it had disappointing or null results. Because nearly all elementary schools in the state reduced class size at once, especially in grades K-2, it was difficult for researchers to find a control group with which to compare outcomes. The state exam was also new, making it difficult to compare achievement gains to past trends. Additionally, some researchers have noted that the program lacked adequate funding to be properly implemented. One serious drawback of this program is that it was much tougher for schools in lower-income communities to benefit as they were already struggling to retain high-quality teachers and maintain a sufficient quantity of classrooms. Thus, schools in higher-income communities, that already had average class sizes around 20 students, most benefited from this program—increasing inequality within the education system.\n\nDespite these limitations and concerns, controlled studies of the effects of California's CSR program showed significant achievement gains from smaller classes, even among third graders who were only in the program for one year. Researchers found, for example, that students who were in reduced classes in grades K-3 had slightly higher scores on NAEP math exams in 4th grade than students from larger classes. The most significant result of this program was that class sizes, across the state, were, on average, reduced. Some other significant effects of the program were that teacher quality had decreased and the use of combination classes had increased. Teacher quality worsened because schools had to dig deeper down in the barrel to find teachers, who were typically less educated and less experienced. The percent of teachers not fully certified, yet teaching, in high-poverty schools increased from 6% in 1995 to 20% by 2001 and 1% to 6% in low-poverty schools. As to why achievement gains were greater for high-poverty minority students, the Coleman Report has a lot to say.\n\nThe Coleman Report, published in 1966, concluded quite controversially that, in essence, family background matters significantly more to a student's academic achievement than any resources a school can offer. The exact factors defining \"family background\" that this report focused on were \"parents' educational attainment, parents' income, parents’ criminal history, and family structure\". The report goes on to explain that it is equally important, if not more so, for public policy to focus on improving resources of the family rather than those of the school. This could suggest that policies attempting to reduce class size might not have as significant effects on a student's educational achievement as would a policy that reduces a student's level of poverty.\n\nResearch on the effects of class size reduction has linked small class sizes with a variety of cognitive and non-cognitive benefits for students and teachers, both short and long-term, especially when class sizes are reduced in the early grades. In fact, class size reduction is one of only a handful of K12 reforms cited by the Institute of Education Sciences (2003) as proven to increase student achievement through rigorous evidence.\n\nReducing class size is among an even smaller number of education reforms that have been shown to narrow the achievement gap. Its benefits are particularly pronounced for lower-income students and children of color, who experience two to three times the gains from smaller classes.\n\nSmaller classes have also been found to have a positive impact on school climate, student socio-emotional growth, safety and suspension rates, parent engagement, and teacher attrition, especially in schools with large numbers of disadvantaged children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmaller classes provide opportunities for teachers to engage in practices that improve student achievement. However, some researchers worry whether teachers will take full advantage of these opportunities, arguing that they tend to use the same strategies (primarily lecturing) with both large and small groups. This concern has led some to advocate for teacher training to unlock the full potential of reduced class sizes.\n\nThough teacher training may improve CSR outcomes, research has demonstrated the benefits of CSR even without any instructional changes. A book reviewing evidence and perspectives on class size from around the world concludes that \"Project STAR produced gains without any changes in the curriculum or any focused teacher training. Small classes in and of themselves produced benefits,\" as was also the case in Wisconsin and California.\n\nGiven the current uncertainty of national financial markets, some commentators have encouraged policymakers to consider whether implementing or broadening class-size-reduction policies is feasible in a time of major budget cuts.\n\nHowever, teacher magazine polls show that greater than 70% of current teachers cite large class sizes as one of their primary barriers to both job satisfaction and their ability to teach. This has led proponents of class size reduction argue that CSR is in fact highly cost effective. They note that low teacher retention rates lead to higher retraining costs and contribute to the current lack of qualified teachers. When faced with a constant flux of new teachers, student achievement has also been shown to suffer.\n\nStudents who go on to finish their education also bring more value to their communities causing some economists to suggest that smaller class sizes may pay for themselves internally, although other economists question this. An analysis of the Tennessee STAR study demonstrated that the economic benefits from higher achievement alone would be expected to yield twice the cost of reducing class size. A meta-analysis of CSR literature revealed that the benefits of smaller class size outweighed the cost in all but three of the 112 peer-reviewed studies. However, one prominent study looking at the program's effect on long-term average wage earnings of students who participated in STAR by linking the data from the experiment to IRS tax records 26 years later disagrees. One of the main findings of this study was that class size does not have a significant effect on earnings by age 27. However, it should be noted that the authors themselves do not consider their evidence to be conclusive and should thus be discounted. One valid finding, though, was that students who had teachers with greater education training and work experience were more likely to achieve higher earnings later in life. Additional findings were that students who were put into smaller classes were more likely to graduate high school and to, later, attend college.\n\n"}

It is a collection of digitized, unedited videos which represent ethnographic research and its corresponding scholarly documentation. Collections gathered by EVIA Project include a diverse range of traditions from around the world.\n\nThe EVIA Digital Archive Project's central purpose is to create a repository of ethnographic video and a framework of tools and systems to support librarians, archivists, and scholars in ethnographic instruction. EVIA Project specifically focuses on topics such as anthropology, dance ethnology ethnomusicology, and folklore. The primary mission of EVIA Project is preserving ethnographic videos that were created by scholars while conducting their research. The secondary goal is to make the content generated by the project available with descriptive annotations, and ultimately, creating a distinct database for scholars, instructors, and students to refer to.\n\nFunding for the Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive Project began in 2001 by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and further included contributions from Indiana University and University of Michigan. It was originally conceived as the “Ethnomusicological Video for Instruction and Analysis Digital Archive”, but moved toward a broader ethnographic center that altered the meaning of its acronym.\n\nIn 2001, the first formal efforts of Digital Archive Project surfaced as their initial planning phases began. Team members which included ethnomusicologists, intellectual property specialists, and digital and video technologists from Indiana University, the University of Michigan, Harvard University, and Ohio State University were all involved in planning workshops trying to resolve issues such as geographic coverage, technical challenges, and ethical issues surrounding the EVIA Project. At the end of the year, team members presented their proposal for the project to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and succeeded in receiving funding.\n\nIn 2009, EVIA Project began working on moving away from their dependence on Mellon Foundation and move more toward a model of sustainability to generate income and financial support from users and institutions, as well as, acquire supplementary income from additional grants and subscription fees from individuals and institutions. Currently, EVIA Project’s work focuses on establishing markets for its products and services and developing efficient means to serve clientele.\n\nEVIA Project utilizes both physical and digital storage systems. EVIA Project operates out of the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University, one of the oldest and largest university-based ethnographic sound archives in the United States.

{"id": "53824360", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53824360", "title": "Girl studies", "text": "Girl studies\n\nGirl studies, also known as girlhood studies, is an interdisciplinary academic field of study that is focused on girlhood and girls' culture that combines advocacy and the direct perspectives and thoughts of girls themselves. The field officially emerged in the 1990s after decades of falling under the broader field of women’s studies. Scholars within girl studies examine social and cultural elements of girlhood and move away from an adult-centered focus. Those working in the field of girl studies have studied it primarily in relation to other fields that include sociology, psychology, education, history, literary studies, media studies, and communication studies. Girl studies seeks to work directly with girls themselves in order to analyze their lives and understand the large societal forces at play within them. Scholars in girl studies also explore the connection the field has to women's studies, boyhood studies, and masculinity studies.\n\nGirl studies officially became a field in the 1990s, after the increase in conversation about getting more girls into science, math, and technology fields in the 1980s, though scholars and researchers were studying girls prior to this decade. In the 1970s, some feminist scholars brought to attention the unbalanced focus of boyhood in comparison to girlhood in youth research. Angela McRobbie, Meda Chesney-Lind, and Christine Griffin were some of the few scholars studying and critiquing the lack of study on girlhood and girl culture in the 1970s and 1980s. In the early 1990s, the Harvard Project on Women's Psychology and Girls' Development conducted a study on the social development of relationships of girls. This study found that when they approach adolescence, girls begin to hide their honest feelings and desires from those they are in close relationships with, making it hard for them to express their feelings later in life. In 1992, the American Association of University Women (AAUW) published \"How Schools Shortchange Girls,\" \"the first national survey to assert a link between girls' psychosocial experience and schooling\".\n\nGirl studies emerged in the 1990s, a time when there was an increased interest from the media and fashion and beauty industries in young women. Advertisers and retailers marketed towards girls by \"promising female youth agency and social value\" from purchasing the products. Within the academy, there was an increase in feminist and gender studies scholars focusing on intersectionality and subsequently on girls. In 2008, scholars Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, and Jackie Kirk established and launched \"\" after recognizing the emerging interest in the field at the 2001 \"A New Girl Order: Young Women and the Future of Feminist Inquiry\" conference at King's College London.\n\nAs girl studies develops, \"there has been significant movement away from studying girls as future women and toward analyzing girls as members of a unique demographic group\", especially in psychology, history, and sociology. There is also a movement towards focusing more on intersectionality and the experiences of girls across the world. In a 2016 article, Claudia Mitchell acknowledges the presence of girlhood studies in Africa, referencing a South African video project called \"Vikea Abantwana (Protect The Children: A Story about Incest)\". The video chronicles the life of Philendelini, a young girl who was raped by her father. Mitchell mentions this film to highlight the necessity of girlhood studies; in the film, Philendelini confides in several adult women about her assault and is ignored or turned down in each instance.\n\nOn the topic of insuring an intersectional and transnational approach in girl studies, scholar Oneka LaBennett commented “Black schoolgirls and college students have engaged in protests across the globe. Girls themselves have drawn attention to the negative impact of things like white beauty standards, the intersections of racial and gender violence, the problems with police brutality and the school-to-prison pipeline.\"\n\nBlack Girlhood Studies has developed in recent years to combat the white washed field of Girls' studies. Black girlhood studies is understood as a site of Black feminist inquiry with aims of centering the coming into knowing Black girls’ experience and representations of Black girlhood. In \"Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-hop Feminist\" Ruth Nicole Brown states that Black girlhood are, “the representations, memories, and lived experiences of being and becoming in a body marked as youthful, Black, and female.” For Brown, Black girlhood is a powerful concept that enables Black girls to create sacred spaces for themselves and each other even while structural forces work “to posit [Black girls] as the very “risky” problem, an aberration of normal.” Brown’s sentiments were echoed again during the 2016 “Black Girl Movement: A National Conference”, a three-day conference at Columbia University in New York City that focused on Black girls, cis, queer, and trans girls, in the United States. The purpose of the conference was to recognize that while Black girls are “among the most significant cultural producers, community connectors, and trendsetters”, Black girls still remain highly invisible and “are in crisis.” Scholars have used this moment to theorize liberating projects for Black girls and Black girlhood, a site of both theoretical and practical analysis. Founded by LaKisha Simmons, Renee Sentilles, and Corinne Field, History of Black Girlhood: An Academic Network provides a forum for scholars centering Black girlhood to share work and collaborate. While many of the work in Black Girlhood Studies is contemporary, there are Black feminist canonical texts that hone in on the ways in which Black girlhood has always already been present in the work of Black women (Beloved by Toni Morrison, For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf by Ntozake Shange, The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood by bell hooks, among many others). These materials span literature, film, poetry, policy, magazine articles, and so on.\n\nMany of the texts foundational to the contemporary field of Black girlhood studies fall within an ethnographic tradition. These works include Elizabeth Chin’s \"Purchasing Power: Black Kids and American Consumer Culture\" (2001), Ruth Nicole Brown’s \"Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-hop Feminist Pedagogy\" (2009) Oneka LaBennett’s S\"he’s Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn\" (2011), and Aimee Meredith Cox’s \"Shapeshifters: Black Girls and the Choreography of Citizenship\" (2015). These texts examine Black girls’ complex racialized, gendered, and age-based cultural realities as they navigate and resist multiple forms of violences. These ethnographies are rooted in a Black feminist epistemological emphasis on centering lived experiences.\n\nHistorians Abosede George \"Making Modern Girls: A history of girlhood, labor, and social development in 20th century colonial Lagos\" (2015), Marcia Chatelain \"South Side Girls: Growing Up in the Great Migration\" (2015), LaKisha Simmons \"Crescent City Girls: The Lives of Young Black Women in Segregated New Orleans\" (2015) extends beyond the ethnographic work of the field in which the three scholars mentioned focus on place and social history to tell the stories of Black girls. This regional approach emphasizes the necessary local specifies of Black girlhood. Nazera Sadiq Wright's \"Black Girlhood in the Nineteenth Century\" (2016) traces a long literary tradition to discover the origins of Black girlhood as we have come to understand the category today.\n\nAs an emerging field, girl studies has faced some criticisms from other scholars. Janie Victoria Wald and Beth Cooper Benjamin have found that connections between \"girls' psychosocial development and persistent issues in adult women's lives\" are not as present in recent scholarship as they were during the advent of the field and believe they should be in order to explore intergenerational relationships. These two scholars also criticize the increased specialization of focus in the field and subsequent disconnect between the subfields. Mary Celeste Kearney, a scholar who does work in girl studies, notices that though there is a focus on intersectionality within the field, \"non-white, non-Western girls remain vastly understudied as result of such research being conducted primarily in Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Northern Europe, and the United States.\" Some critics identify problems that they see with the field as a whole, claiming that it is neither a new nor exciting field, as the \"Girlhood Studies\" journal states, but rather one that is established and in crisis.\n\nGirlhood and girl power work together to form a strong bond between young girls across the globe. When girls are growing up, they are learning from the women around them, what is right and what is wrong. Women of the older ages are set up as role models for those who are under the age of 18. The future of girlhood is in the hands of those who chose to set a good example forward for these young people to grasp onto. Marnina et al., explained in their book that we are past the after-girl power stage (2009). After passing this stage these groups of writers are posing another question as to if there is something that comes after this stage. Girls have seen violence from all sorts of stages causing them to fear their growing up ways. As mentioned in the text \"History and Popular Culture at Work in the Subjectivity of a Tween,\" the authors daughter was scared to become an adult because of the concerns of others. Other people in her class were bring articles and other pieces of writing that scared Elisabeth into thinking that growing up was not something that she wanted to do (2005). With girls having these types of ideas rushing through their minds as they get older – we are not helping them grow in a safe space. Instead, we are raising them to fear the outside world and not want to be a part of it. This can change if we focus on what comes next once we pass the after-girl power. \n"}

Ctesias was the court physician to king Artaxerxes II of Persia, and the book is not based on his own experiences, but on stories brought to Persia by traders, along the Silk Road from Serica, a land north of China and India where domesticated silk originated.\n\nThe book contains the first known reference to the unicorn, ostensibly an ass in India that had a single 1.5 cubit (27 inch) horn on its head, and introduces the European world to the talking parrot, and falconry, which was not yet practiced in Europe. \n\nAmong the information apparently conveyed in the book (mostly according to second-hand accounts of its contents):\n\n\nCtesias' books contains such a mix of obviously dubious apocrypha among its truths that it was sometimes mocked by subsequent authors as a source of wild yarns and myths. \n\nIn the Second Century AD, the satirist Lucian depicted Ctesias as being condemned to a special part of hell reserved for those who spread wild lies during their lifetimes. Indica apparently included such anecdotes as the description of a race of one-legged people called the Monosceli, another whose feet were so big they could be used as umbrellas (the Skiopolae), men with tails like satyrs, and claimed that people in the actual land of Serica (a word thought in some other cases to be the Greek word for part of China) were 18 feet tall. Lucian's own similar book, A True Story, was presented as a satire of \"Indica\", including an introduction that calls Ctesias and other similar authors inexperienced liars. Lucian states that he, himself, will now present a similar lie, but unlike his predecessors, he is at least honest enough to state this plainly up-front.\n\nConversely, the book did serve as the original source for a great deal of actual knowledge about the East that appears to have been completely absent in Western literature. Though only fragments exist today, its probable contents are very well-known because they were the main reference for Mediterranean knowledge of India, for centuries, and therefore are cited and quoted by many ancient authors whose works do survive to this day.\n"}
{"id": "7371802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7371802", "title": "Institutional Critique", "text": "Institutional Critique\n\nIn art, Institutional Critique is the systematic inquiry into the workings of art institutions, such as galleries and museums, and is most associated with the work of artists like Michael Asher, Marcel Broodthaers, Daniel Buren, Andrea Fraser, John Knight (artist), Adrian Piper, Fred Wilson, and Hans Haacke and the scholarship of Alexander Alberro, Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, Birgit Pelzer, and Anne Rorimer.\n\nInstitutional Critique takes the form of temporary or nontransferable approaches to painting and sculpture, architectural alterations and interventions, and performative gestures and language intended to disrupt the otherwise transparent operations of galleries and museums and the professionals who administer them. Examples would be Neile Toroni making imprints of a No. 50 brush at 30cm intervals directly onto gallery walls as opposed to applying the same mark to paper or canvas; Chris Burden's \"Exposing the Foundation of the Museum\" (1986), in which he made an excavation in a gallery of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, to expose the literal concrete foundation of the building; or Andrea Fraser inhabiting the persona of an archetypical museum docent in the form of a live performance or video document. Assumptions about the aesthetic autonomy of painting and sculpture, the neutral context of the white cube, and the objective delivery of information are explored as subjects of art, mapped out as discursive formations, and (re)framed within the context of the museum itself. As such, Institutional Critique seeks to make visible the social, political, economic, and historical underpinnings of art. Institutional Critique questions the false distinction between taste and disinterested aesthetic judgement, revealing that taste is an institutionally cultivated sensibility that differs depending on the intersection of any one person's class, ethnic, sexual, or gender subject positions.\n\nInstitutional Critique is a practice that emerged from the developments of Minimalism and its concerns with the phenomenology of the viewer; formalist art criticism and art history (e.g. Clement Greenberg and Michael Fried); conceptual art and its concerns with language, processes, and administrative society; and the critique of authorship that begins with Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault in the late 1960s and continues with the advent of appropriation art in the 1970s and its upending of long-held notions of authorship, originality, artistic production, popular culture, and identity. Institutional critique is often site-specific and is contemporaneous with the advent of artists who eschewed gallery and museum contexts altogether to build monumental earthworks in the landscape, notably Michael Heizer, Nancy Holt, Walter de Maria, and Robert Smithson. Institutional critique is also associated with the development of post-structuralist philosophy, critical theory, literary theory, feminism, gender studies, and critical race theory.\n\nArtists associated with Institutional Critique since the 1960s include Marcel Broodthaers, Daniel Buren, Hans Haacke, Michael Asher, John Knight (artist), Christopher D'Arcangelo, Robert Smithson, Dan Graham, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Adrian Piper, and Martha Rosler. Artists active since the 1980s include Louise Lawler, Antoni Muntadas, Fred Wilson, Renée Green, Group Material, Andrea Fraser, Fred Forest, Christian Philipp Müller, Aaron Flint Jamison, and Mark Dion. \n\nIn the early 1990s, influenced in large part by Daniel Buren, Jacques Tati, Roland Barthes, and the participatory sculptures of Felix Gonzalez-Torres, a loose affiliation of artists including Liam Gillick, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Pierre Huyghe, and Rirkrit Tiravanija engaged the institution of art in a convivial manner. These artists, gathered under the rubric of Relational Aesthetics by critic Nicholas Bourriaud, saw galleries and museums as sites of social interaction and the spontaneous creation of works of art characterized by their contingent temporality. The collegial atmosphere of these open-ended situations was quite distinct from the more confrontational strategies of Buren, Haacke, Jenny Holzer, and Barbara Kruger.\n\nIn recent years, Maurizio Cattelan, Brian Goeltzenleuchter, Matthieu Laurette, Tameka Norris, Tino Sehgal, Carey Young, and others have taken a critical eye to the art museum and its role as a public and private institution.\n\nOne of the criticisms of Institutional Critique is that it requires from its audience a familiarity with its esoteric concerns. As with much contemporary music and dance, the Institutional Critique of art is a practice that only specialists in the field—artists, theorists, historians, and critics—are privy to. Due to its sophisticated understanding of modern art and society—and as part of a privileged discourse not unlike other specialized forms of knowledge—art as Institutional Critique can often leave layman viewers alienated and/or marginalized.\n\nAnother criticism of the concept is that it can be a misnomer. Artist Andrea Fraser (in Artforum) and critic Michael Kimmelman (in The New York Times) have argued, for example, that institutional critique artists work within—and benefit from—the very same institutions they ostensibly critique.\n\n"}
{"id": "14919", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14919", "title": "International Standard Book Number", "text": "International Standard Book Number\n\nThe International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is a unique numeric commercial book identifier. Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.\n\nAn ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-based and varies from country to country, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.\n\nThe initial ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in 1967, based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (the SBN code can be converted to a ten-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit \"0\").\n\nPrivately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative.\n\nAnother identifier, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines; and the International Standard Music Number (ISMN) covers for musical scores.\n\nThe Standard Book Numbering (SBN) code is a 9-digit commercial book identifier system created by Gordon Foster, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin, for the booksellers and stationers WHSmith and others in 1965. The ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker (regarded as the \"Father of the ISBN\") and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency R.R. Bowker).\n\nThe 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108. The United Kingdom continued to use the 9-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 TC 46/SC 9. The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978.\n\nAn SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit \"0\". For example, the second edition of \"Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns\", published by Hodder in 1965, has – 340 indicating the publisher, 01381 their serial number, and 8 being the check digit. This can be converted to ; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated.\n\nSince 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained 13 digits, a format that is compatible with \"Bookland\" European Article Number EAN-13s.\n\nAn ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an ebook, a paperback, and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of 4 parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or 5 parts (for a 13-digit ISBN):\n\n\nA 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (\"prefix element\", \"registration group\", \"registrant\", \"publication\" and \"check digit\"), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces. Separating the parts (\"registration group\", \"registrant\", \"publication\" and \"check digit\") of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.\n\nISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.\n\nA full directory of ISBN agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website. Partial listing:\n\nThe ISBN registration group identifier is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979), and can be separated between hyphens, such as . Registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element. The single-digit group identifiers within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. An example 5-digit group identifier is 99936, for Bhutan. The allocated group IDs are: 0–5, 600–622, 65, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9920–9989, and 99901–99981. Books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers.\n\nWithin the 979 prefix element, the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN. The registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy.\n\nThe original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero (0) to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.\n\nThe national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element (cf. ) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not required by law to assign an ISBN; however, most bookstores only handle ISBN bearing publications.\n\nA listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form (€1399, US$1959). The web site of the ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes. Partial lists have been compiled (from library catalogs) for the English-language groups: identifier 0 and identifier 1.\n\nPublishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.\n\nBy using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements. Here are some sample <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> codes, illustrating block length variations.\nEnglish-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 (2 of more than 220 registration group elements). These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows:\n\nA check digit is a form of redundancy check used for error detection, the decimal equivalent of a binary check bit. It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the ten-digit code is an extension of that for SBNs, the two systems are compatible, and SBN prefixed with \"0\" will give the same check-digit as without – the digit is base eleven, and can be 0-9 or X. The system for thirteen-digit codes is not compatible and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, and does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the thirteen-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain an \"X\".\n\nThe 2001 edition of the official manual of the International ISBN Agency says that the <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> check digit – which is the last digit of the ten-digit ISBN – must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol X is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11.\n\nFor example, for an <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> of 0-306-40615-2:\n\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, we can say:\n\nIt is also true for <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki>'s that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in \"ascending\" order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:\n\nFormally, we can say:\n\nThe two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g., typing or writing it) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be proved that all possible valid <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki>'s have at least two digits different from each other. It can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki>'s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. (These are true only because the ISBN is less than 11 digits long, and because 11 is a prime number.)\nThe ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e. if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN – the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected, the book will be issued with an invalid ISBN.\n\nIn contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).\n\nEach of the first nine digits of the ten-digit ISBN—excluding the check digit itself—is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.\n\nFor example, the check digit for an <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> of 0-306-40615-\"?\" is calculated as follows:\nAdding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (132 = 12 x 11) − this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is <nowiki>ISBN 0-306-40615-2</nowiki>. The value formula_6 required to satisfy this condition might be 10; if so, an 'X' should be used.\n\nAlternatively, modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 – 0 = 11 which is invalid. (Strictly speaking the \"first\" \"modulo 11\" is unneeded, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)\n\nFor example, the check digit for the <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> of 0-306-40615-\"?\" is calculated as follows:\n\nThus the check digit is 2.\n\nIt is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding codice_1 into codice_2 computes the necessary multiples:\n\nThe modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case codice_2 could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid <nowiki>ISBN 99999-999-9-X</nowiki>), or codice_2 and codice_1 could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.\n\nThe 2005 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official manual describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10.\n\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, we can say:\n\nThe calculation of an <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero (0) replaces a ten (10), so, in all cases, a single check digit results.\n\nFor example, the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit of 978-0-306-40615-\"?\" is calculated as follows:\n\nThus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is <nowiki>ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7</nowiki>.\n\nIn general, the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> check digit is calculated as follows.\n\nLet\n\nThen\n\nThis check system – similar to the UPC check digit formula – does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3×6+1×1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3×1+1×6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The <nowiki>ISBN-10</nowiki> formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit.\n\nAdditionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).\n\nThe conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix \"978\" to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> algorithm.\n\nPublishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers. For example, is shared by two books – \"Ninja gaiden®: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo\" (1990) and \"Wacky laws\" (1997), both published by Scholastic.\n\nMost libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase \"Cancelled ISBN\". However, book-ordering systems such as Amazon.com will not search for a book if an invalid ISBN is entered to its search engine. OCLC often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.\n\nOnly the term \"ISBN\" should be used; the terms \"eISBN\" and \"e-ISBN\" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital (e-book) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate EPUB, Amazon Kindle, and PDF formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic \"eISBN\" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.\n\nCurrently the barcodes on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover) are EAN-13; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN-5 for the currency and the recommended retail price. For 10-digit ISBNs, the number \"978\", the Bookland \"country code\", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula (modulo 10, 1x and 3x weighting on alternating digits).\n\nPartly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit ISBN (<nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki>). The process began 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 January 2007. , all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an \"M\" letter; the bar code represents the \"M\" as a zero (0), and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now 13 digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.\n\nPublisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the ten-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.\n\nBarcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence, many booksellers (e.g., Barnes & Noble) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the <nowiki>ISBN-13</nowiki> in North America.\n\n\n"}

The next election for the position as the Vice Rector I to be in charge of academics it was between Jawahir Thontowi and Sarwidi which was a very close election and Sarwidi manages to be elected for the position having 309,5 votes compared to only 298,5 votes. Supporters of Jawahir Thontowi in campus still remain strong.\n\nIn 2010 election Jawahir Thontowi became in the running for the peak positions in campus again. Still competing versus Edy Suandi Hamid and Sarwidi, the election process was very tight Edy Suandi Hamid with only 32 votes, Jawahir Thontowi 31 votes and Sarwidi 25 votes. Interesting that in 2006 elections he lost to Sarwidi for the position but now in the 2010 he has more votes.\n\nAfter losing from the selection process, he came back to the law faculty to continue to teach, practice what he has learned and implement his understanding about the law in Indonesia. This experience will be the foundations of the position in the future for the next election process in 2014 to become the rector of campus. To have the highest academic career in UII starting as a student activist, then becoming a researcher and lecturer, then become the dean of the law faculty and hope the next position becoming the rector.\n\n\n"}

(Lucile) Taylor Hansen (November 30, 1897 – May 1976) was a writer of science fiction popular science articles and books who used a male writing persona for the early part of her career. She is the author of eight short stories, nearly sixty nonfiction articles popularizing anthropology and geology, and three nonfiction books.\n\nAn autobiographical sketch by Hansen begins with her memory of staying with her parents in an abandoned fort after the \"Indian Wars.\" In 1919, she writes, she was initiated into an Ojibwe tribe after she suggested to the tribe that they not kill the agency doctor but instead protest his appointment to Washington administrators. She then enters into a lifelong project to study of Native American legends.\n\nShe attended classes at the University of California, Los Angeles during the 1920s but did not receive a degree.\n\nStarting with the September 1941 issue of \"Amazing,\" Hansen wrote \"Scientific Mysteries,\" a regular column of non-fiction articles that continued until 1948. Combined with her other non-fiction articles, she wrote nearly sixty articles during this period, appearing from five to twelve times per year. Her first article picks up on the work of her father regarding the continental drift. She reviews criticisms of the theory and presents evidence that supports it, such as geologic continuities and homologous species that appear on different continents. She presents a field of researchers working together so that \"the veils of mystery are being pushed back from the library which is the past.\" Hansen credits this series of articles as being the start of her investigation of how the different stories of the Americas might have some common origins.\n\nHansen did not shy away from the controversial issues surrounding anthropology as the last vestiges of scientific racism fell away in the years before World War II. A July 1942 article, for instance, asserts that contemporary \"standards of color are far too superficial.\" She points out that the skull shape of the Mayans, which would have supported the craniometric proposition that races differ culturally because of their distinctive skull geometries, does not \"affect their intelligence.\" While she reports on findings that are now not credible – such as the idea that the population of Africa is a recently evolved type – she is remarkable for suggesting that Africans are not primitive but more evolved than other human types.\n\nLater, Hansen begins experimenting with pseudonyms. The article \"America's Mysterious Race of Indian Giants\" appeared in the December 1946 issue of \"Amazing,\" and while the writing style was \"recognizable as that of columnist L. Taylor Hansen,\" it was credited to \"Chief Sequoyah.\" A second story by Chief Sequoyah, \"Spirit of the Serpent God,\" appeared in the June 1948 issue of \"Amazing.\" The story \"The Fire-Trail,\" credited to a Navaho Oge-Make, appeared in the January 1948 issue of \"Amazing.\" She also credited a second story to Oge-Make, \"Tribal Memories of the Flying Saucers,\" that appeared in another magazine Palmer edited, Fate, in the September 1949 issue.\n\nAs she completed her survey of Native American legends, Hansen published three nonfiction books. The first, \"Some Considerations of and Additions to the Taylor-Wegener Hypothesis of Continental Displacement\" (1946), details the elaboration of the continental drift theory proposed by Frank Bursley Taylor. Her second book, \"He Walked the Americas\" (1963), is a frequently cited taxonomy of Native American legends that report of a light-skinned prophet. Her last book, \"The Ancient Atlantic\" (1969), surveys the culture and geography of the Atlantic Ocean and touches on the legend of Atlantis.\n\nHansen wrote the book \"He Walked the Americas\" in 1963. In the book drawing from Native American legends, folklore and mythology discussed that a \"White Prophet\" had visited many different parts of America. Some Mormons have used this book as evidence supporting the Book of Mormon, which depicts Christianity practiced in the ancient Americas, including a visitation of the resurrected Jesus Christ.\n\nHansen's science fiction career was brief, but she is notable for being an early woman in the genre who concealed her sex. Her first story, \"What the Sodium Lines Revealed,\" appeared in Hugo Gernsback's \"Amazing Stories Quarterly\" in the Winter 1929 issue. This story, while a Gernsback-era adventure, hinges upon scientific ideas in that a message is detected in a spectrograph by an amateur astronomer. That same year, her second story \"The Undersea Tube,\" details an underground civilization that is uncovered while developing a pneumatic commuter train between New York and Liverpool.\n\nAs asserted by Eric Leif Davin, of the women in the early science fiction magazines, only L. Taylor Hansen seems to have concealed her sex. The subterfuge was extensive. An illustration of a young man, purportedly Hansen, appeared with Hansen's fifth story, \"The City on the Cloud.\" Hansen continued the subterfuge by asserting on the telephone to fan Forrest J. Ackerman that she was not the author of her stories but only handled them for her brother. Jane Donawerth suggests that Hansen's creation of a world-traveled, male brother was a \"probably social crisis\" in that she did not want to violate the convention of a male narrator in science fiction and so her persona allows her to \"protect herself from social disapproval.\"\n\nHowever, as reported by Davin, the facts of the encounter between Ackerman and Hansen are somewhat contradictory. A letter from Hansen was titled \"L. Taylor Hansen Defends Himself\" in the July 1943 issue of \"Amazing Stories,\" but Davin asserts this is because she was a private person and not because she was trying to maintain credibility. The editor, Raymond A. Palmer, had \"little trouble working with women\" as evinced by the many women who were published in \"Amazing\" during the 1940s.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21300477", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21300477", "title": "Legal practice", "text": "Legal practice\n\nLegal practice is sometimes used to distinguish the body of judicial or administrative precedents, rules, policies, customs, and doctrines from legislative enactments such as statutes and constitutions which might be called \"laws\" in the strict sense of being commands to the general public, rather than only to a set of parties.\n\nIn the legal practice that emerged in royal courts under Henry II any case had to fit into a narrowly defined form of pleading usually called a \"writ\". By the time of Henry III the number of such writs had grown to over 500, but even that many did not cover all the possible claims that people sought to make.\n\nThe Provisions of Oxford in 1258 forbade the royal clerks to create any new writs. The result of this was that the courts began to adopt \"fictions\" such as imaginary parties or actors so that the facts of a case could be fit within one of the established forms, and the Writ of Trespass came to become the catchall form for most claims.\n\nIt is important to understand that, unlike much current practice, the writs of pleading were not court orders granting relief but the summons, prepared by the plaintiff, filed with the court, and served on the respondent.\n\nThe nonconflicting parts of the English and American common law and its forms of pleading were explicitly incorporated into the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSeventh Amendment:\n\nIn Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century strong resistance developed to the rigidities of the common law forms of pleading brought over from England, whose monarchical forms often conflicted with U.S. republican law that made the people the sovereign.\n\nNew York State was the first to adopt a codification of legal forms and procedures, called the Field Code from its principal author, David Dudley Field II. Within a few years, most but not all other states adopted similar codes. One of the reforms made was to unite courts of law and equity. The reforms made it easier to get a case started without loading most of the argument and proof at the outset, and made discovery more important during the course of the case. However, there was opposition to the reforms, and resistance from the legal profession, including judges, that prevented the codes from being implemented as intended.\n\nBefore the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) were enacted in 1938, common law pleading was more formal, traditional, and particular in its phrases and requirements. For example, a plaintiff bringing a trespass suit would have to mention certain key words in his complaint or risk it being dismissed with prejudice. In contrast, the FRCP is based on a legal construction called notice pleading, which is less formal, created and modified by legal experts, and far less technical in requirements. In notice pleading, the same plaintiff bringing suit would not face dismissal for lack of the exact legal term, so long as the claim itself was legally actionable. The policy behind this change is to simply give \"notice\" of your grievances, and leave the details for later in the case. This acts in the interest of equity by concentrating on the actual law and not the exact construction of pleas.\n\nThirty-five states have adopted versions of the federal rules as their own procedural code.\n\nIn addition to notice pleading, a minority of states (\"e.g.\", California) use an intermediate system known as \"code pleading\". Code pleading is an older system than notice pleading and is based on legislative statute. It tends to straddle the gulf between obsolete common-law pleading and modern notice pleading. Code pleading places additional burdens on a party to plead the \"ultimate facts\" of its case, laying out the party's entire case and the facts or allegations underlying it. Notice pleading, by contrast, simply requires a \"short and plain statement\" showing only that the pleader is entitled to relief. (FRCP 8(a)(2)). One important exception to this rule is that when a party alleges fraud, that party must plead the facts of the alleged fraud with particularity. (FRCP 9(b)).\n\nThere has been some controversy over whether the FCRP violate the Eighth Amendment requirement of common law rules, but the usual answer has been that the changes are only in form and not in substance.\n\n"}

The capital of Tortall is Corus, located near the western coast on the Emerald Ocean.\nTo the north is Scanra, a wild and somewhat barbaric country. Tortall and Scanra are at war in the last two Protector books and the first Trickster book, \"Trickster's Choice\". To the east are Galla, Tusaine, and Tyra, and past them are Maren and Sarain. Carthak (setting for \"Emperor Mage\") is south of Tortall across the Inland Sea, while to the west lie the Yamani Islands and the Copper Isles. To the east of Maren and Sarain is The Roof of the World, a large mountain range. The Trickster books mostly take place in the Copper Isles, further south than the Yamani islands.\n\n\"The Hunt Records\" take place hundreds of years before the other books, and Barzun, a nation between Tortall and the Inland Sea later is occasional mentioned. Barzun was later conquered by Tortall.\n\nTortall is a place somewhat reminiscent of the European Middle Ages, with its monarchy, court, nobility, and knights, but is otherwise a completely different world. Magic is very real and practical to Tortallans, from the common hedgewitch to the King's court mages. Deities are revered and often play a part in human lives, sometimes choosing humans as champions, sometimes using them to further their own purposes. Though these deities are shown as powerful beyond belief, they rely on their human instruments to shape the world.\n\n\"The Song of The Lioness\" was originally written as one single book for adults, but her literary agent suggested that she rewrite it into four books aimed at a young adult audience. Pierce literally cut up the manuscript and used the pieces to form four new books for teenagers. She has received numerous requests to publish the original manuscript, but claims it no longer exists, and wouldn't be worth publishing anyway.\n\nPlot\n\nAlanna of Trebond (later Alanna of Pirate's Swoop and Olau) is a ground-breaking female knight. Although noble-born girls traditionally go to the convent to learn how to be proper noblewomen and wives, Alanna desires to become a knight, a position only given to noble-born boys. In order to achieve her dream, Alanna disguises herself as a boy under the name of Alan and goes to the palace in place of her twin brother Thom. As Thom has no interest in becoming a knight, and is far more interested in his magic, Thom forges a letter so that he can go to a temple to become an enormously strong and skilled sorcerer.\n\nThe series follows Alanna's training and the early years of her full knighthood, a time-span of ten years. Alanna has quite a few strong romantic relationships throughout the series, including Prince Jonathan, George Cooper, and Liam Ironarm, the Shang (a martial arts society) Dragon.\n\n\nThis quartet is also called \"Wild Magic\" after its first volume, published by Atheneum in 1992. The story features Veralidaine (Daine) Sarrasri who was orphaned when raiders attacked her village. Daine has an unusual (and extremely strong) gift of wild magic which is mistaken for insanity because she is unable to control it. Though convinced she has no magical Gift, it is discovered that she has 'wild magic' – a magic that is not uncommon, but for some reason is a disregarded branch of magic. What is rare is the amount of it that Daine possesses, and what she is able to do with it. This magic gives her a unique connection with animals. Her abilities manifest gradually throughout the series, allowing her first to speak with animals, to heal their injuries and eventually to shape-shift into animal forms. The series covers a timespan of four years, following Daine as she learns to communicate with humans, animals, and Immortals.\n\n\nThe story features Keladry of Mindelan, the first girl to follow in Alanna's footsteps—legally and without disguise, after a law is passed allowing girls to try for knighthood. As she begins her training, Kel is constantly harassed, injured, plagued by doubters and put on probation by her training master, who thinks a girl will never succeed. Kel discovers the hazing of young pages and fights the bullies to put a stop to it. Kel makes memorable friends throughout the series, including the wry Nealan of Queenscove, and also Lord Raoul of Goldenlake, an old friend of Alanna's. She meets some key enemies, including Joren of Stone Mountain, her fellow page. The series follows Kel's training and the first year of her knighthood, a timespan of nine years.\n\n\nThis duology is also called \"Daughter of the Lioness\" from \"The Song of the Lioness\" four-book series. Its omnibus edition is \"Tricksters\" (SFBC, 2005). It is actually as long as the earlier quartets, because these books are about twice the length of the earlier works. Pierce explained that the greatly huge, popular success of the seven Harry Potter books finally showed publishers that young readers will read big books.\n\nThe duology is the story of Alianne (Aly) of Pirate's Swoop, the 16-year-old daughter of the legendary Alanna the Lioness. Disallowed work as a Tortallan spy by her parents, Aly leaves home only to be captured by pirates and sold into slavery in the Copper Isles. Under the guidance of Kyprioth, the god of tricksters, Aly involves herself with a conspiracy of the native \"raka\" people against their \"luarin\" conquerors, in accordance with a prophecy made by Kyprioth himself through one of his priestesses, centuries earlier. The duology covers a timespan of two years. Aly is a much different person from her mother, closer to her father.\n\n\nThis trilogy is also called Provost's Dog. It is set in the realm of Tortall, 200 years before \"Alanna: The First Adventure\". Nominated for the 2012 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children's Literature.\n\nGeorge Cooper is a young boy in the series prologue, and is caught stealing. His ashamed mother then tells him about his famous ancestress, named Rebakah Cooper. \"Beka\" Cooper is a trainee for the Provost's Guard, which is Tortall's equivalent of a police force. In those days, they were called \"Dogs\" and trainees were known as \"Puppies,\" both of whom were stationed at \"Kennels\" (this was where the term \"Provost's Dog\" came from).\n\n\n\nThe Numair Chronicles is a three-book series about the childhood of Arram Draper, who will grow up to be the Great Mage, Numair Salmalín.\n\n\n\n\nAs some series and short stories are prequels, the chronologic order differs from publication order. Books that were published later frequently mention characters from books that were published earlier. However, each quartet or series can be read independently of the others.\n\n\n± Location in timeline uncertain\n\nSetting \nThe \"Circle of Magic\" quartet is set in the land of Emelan; the \"Circle Opens\" quartet and the \"Circle Reforged\" quartet are set in Emelan and various neighbouring countries. \nNeighboring countries include Sotat (east of Emelan; birthplace of Briar Moss), Qalai (north-east of Emelan), Lairan (north of Emelan), Gansar (north-west of Emelan), and Anderann (west of Emelan, birthplace of Dedicate Rosethorn). Other countries in the Circle universe include Chammur (setting of \"Street Magic\"), Thairos (setting of \"Shatterglass\"), Namorn (far north, setting of \"Cold Fire\" and \"The Will of the Empress\"), Gyongxe (setting of Battle Magic), Yanjing (birthplace of Evumeimei Dingzai) Capchen (birthplace of Trisana Chandler), the Battle Islands (setting of Melting Stones), Hatar Island in the Pebbled Sea, Olart (north of the Pebbled Sea), and Mbau (south of the Pebbled Sea).\n\nIn the Circle universe, magic is common and regularly used, but individuals need to be born with the ability to use it. There are two forms of magic. Academic magic is directly linked to the energy within the user and may require incantations or physical catalysts. Ambient magic is less common, is associated with a certain craft (such as carpentry) or item of nature (such as lightning), and involves power from the surroundings flowing through the user. Most cultures in the Circle universe are polytheistic, but unlike the Tortall universe, gods less frequently try to affect mortal events.\n\nPlot\nThe series tells the stories of four 10-year-old children: Sandrilene fa Toren, Trisana Chandler, Daja Kisubo and Briar Moss, known as Sandry, Tris, Daja, and Briar, respectively. They are discovered in various troubled circumstances and brought together by Niklaren Goldeye (referred to as Niko), a powerful mage, who tells them that they are \"ambient mages,\" which means that they use magic derived from the environment. The four youths do not fit in with the other children of the monastic Winding Circle community to which Niko brings them and are put together in a separate cottage, called Discipline. Here they each learn of their hidden talents: Sandry with thread, Tris with weather, Daja with fire and metal, and Briar with plants. Lark, a gentle woman especially attentive to Sandry since she also has thread magic, and Rosethorn, a sharp woman who shares Briar's ability with plants, live with and instruct the children in their magical and personal growth. Also teaching and guiding them is Niko, technically Tris's teacher, but available to all four. Daja is taught by Dedicate Initiate Frostpine, a smith mage. At first it seems that a merchant, a street rat, a noblewoman, and a Trader (a trading race that is often hated by others) will never get along, but an extraordinary circumstance brings them together. Through an earthquake, they realize their full potential and are bound closely together forever. As children skilled in uncommon magics, they struggle to earn the respect of the adults they encounter and to fully understand and control their magical powers.\nNominated for the 2000 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children's Literature\n\n\nCompilations\n\nThe young mages, now 14 years old, are officially certified by Winding Circle and become teachers. In this quartet, each of the four protagonists travels with their mentor, taking on a new student and combating problems abroad.\n\n\n\nThe initial working title for this book was \"The Circle Reforged\". It is the first book in \"The Circle Reforged\" series. Sandry's cousin, the Empress of Namorn (Berenene dor Ocmor), has been begging her to come visit her for years. Finally the stitch witch agrees, but her uncle requests that her childhood friends accompany her. However, during the time they were separated the foursome has broken apart, and are now adults with secrets that they once would have shared. Sandry expects to visit her cousin for the summer then return home to her uncle in Emelan, but the Empress has other plans. As the four soon find out, the iron will of the Empress is considered law, and the four must set aside their doubts and trust each other as they once did if they are to escape.\n\nThis story was first released as a full-cast audiobook (produced by Full Cast Audio) to be followed by paper versions. This is the first full-length novel written expressly for audio. The recording date had been postponed, and the audiobook was finally released in fall 2007. Pierce herself directs the recording. The print version was released in fall 2008. The story is based on Evvy, who, with Rosethorn, goes to investigate the weird happenings of an island. Plants and animals are dying and the two mages are there to find out why. Meanwhile, Evvy meets two lava/magma spirits and is caught up in their quest to escape their mountain tomb.\n\nThis story follows Briar, Rosethorn, and Evvy as they travel to the far east, through the sacred lands of Gyongxe and on to Yanjing. While visiting with the God-King in Gyongxe, the traveling mages are summoned to the Yanjing emperor's summer palace. Although they were treated like royalty when they first arrive, they soon discover that the emperor plans to invade Gyongxe, posing a fatal threat to the home temple of the Living Circle religion. Accompanied by one of the emperor's prize captives, the three mages rush to Gyongxe to warn its citizens of the impending attack. With the imperials hot on their trail, Briar, Rosethorn, and Evvy must quickly help the country prepare for battle. But even with the help of new allies, will their combined forces be enough to fight the imperial army and win the war?\n\nForthcoming\n\n\n\n\nTortall and Other Lands: A Collection of Tales (2010)\n\nContents:\n\n\nContents:\n\nAt the 2006 New York Comicon, Marvel Comics announced that Pierce and her husband Tim Liebe would write a new series, starring former FBI agent Angela Del Toro as the new \"White Tiger\". \"White Tiger\" launched as a six-issue series drawn by French artist Phil Briones in November 2006.\n\n\n\n\n\nTamora Pierce was the \"head writer for a company that did original radio comedy and drama in the 1980s, a part-time editor for two magazines, and the writer of various fiction and nonfiction for magazines\".\nThe first short story Tamora sold was to a women's romance magazine, titled \"What We Did Was Sin\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "425824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425824", "title": "London Charterhouse", "text": "London Charterhouse\n\nThe London Charterhouse is a historic complex of buildings in Smithfield, London, dating back to the 14th century. It occupies land to the north of Charterhouse Square, and lies within the London Borough of Islington. \n\nThe Charterhouse began as (and takes its name from) a Carthusian priory, founded in 1371 and dissolved in 1537. Substantial fragments remain from this monastic period, but the site was largely rebuilt after 1545 as a large courtyard house. Thus, today it \"conveys a vivid impression of the type of large rambling 16th century mansion that once existed all round London\". \n\nThe Charterhouse was further altered and extended after 1611, when it became an almshouse and school, endowed by Thomas Sutton. The almshouse (a home for gentlemen pensioners) still occupies the site today under the name The Charterhouse; the school moved out in 1872 to Godalming, Surrey, where it survives as Charterhouse School (although its formal name does not include the word \"school\").\n\nIn 1348, Walter de Manny rented of land in Spital Croft, north of Long Lane, from the Master and Brethren of St Bartholomew's Hospital for a graveyard and plague pit for victims of the Black Death. A chapel and hermitage were constructed, renamed New Church Haw; but in 1371 this land was granted for the foundation of the London Charterhouse, a Carthusian monastery.\n\nThe twenty-five monks each had their own small building and garden. Thomas More came to the monastery for spiritual recuperation. The name is derived as an Anglicisation of \"La Grande Chartreuse\", whose order founded the monastery.\n\nThe monastery was closed in 1537, in the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the English Reformation. As it resisted dissolution the monastery was treated harshly: the Prior, John Houghton was hanged, drawn and quartered at Tyburn and ten monks were taken to the nearby Newgate Prison; nine of these men starved to death and the tenth was executed three years later at Tower Hill. They constitute the group known as the Carthusian Martyrs.\n\nFor several years after the dissolution of the priory, members of the Bassano family of instrument makers were amongst the tenants of the former monks' cells, whilst Henry VIII stored hunting equipment in the church. But, in 1545, the entire site was bought by Sir Edward (later Lord) North (c. 1496–1564), who transformed the complex into a luxurious mansion house. North demolished the church and built the Great Hall and adjoining Great Chamber. In 1558, during North's occupancy, Queen Elizabeth I used the house during the preparations for her coronation.\n\nFollowing North's death, the property was purchased by Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who renamed it Howard House. In 1570, following his imprisonment in the Tower of London for scheming to marry Mary, Queen of Scots, Norfolk was placed under house arrest at the Charterhouse. He occupied his time by embellishing the house, and built a long terrace in the garden (which survives as the \"Norfolk Cloister\") leading to a tennis court. In 1571, Norfolk's involvement in the Ridolfi plot was exposed after a ciphered letter from Mary, Queen of Scots was discovered under a doormat in the house; he was executed the following year.\n\nThe property passed to Norfolk's son, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk. During his occupancy, James I held court there on his first entrance into London in 1603.\n\nIn May 1611 it came into the hands of Thomas Sutton (1532–1611) of Knaith, Lincolnshire. He was appointed Master of Ordnance in Northern Parts, and acquired a fortune by the discovery of coal on two estates which he had leased near Newcastle upon Tyne, and later, upon moving to London, he carried on a commercial career. Before he died on 12 December of that year, he endowed a hospital on the site of the Charterhouse, calling it the Hospital of King James; and in his will he bequeathed money to maintain a chapel, hospital (almshouse) and school.\n\nIn the \"Case of Sutton's Hospital\", his will was hotly contested but upheld in court, meaning the foundation was constituted to afford a home for eighty male pensioners (\"gentlemen by descent and in poverty, soldiers that have borne arms by sea or land, merchants decayed by piracy or shipwreck, or servants in household to the King or Queens Majesty\"), and to educate forty boys.\n\nCharterhouse early established a reputation for excellence in hospital care and treatment, thanks in part to Henry Levett, M.D., an Oxford graduate who joined the school as physician in 1712. Levett was widely esteemed for his medical writings, including an early tract on the treatment of smallpox. He was buried in Charterhouse Chapel, and his widow married Andrew Tooke, the master of Charterhouse. \n\nThe school, Charterhouse School, developed beyond the original intentions of its founder, to become a well-regarded public school. In 1872, under the headmastership of William Haig Brown, the school moved to new buildings in the parish of Godalming in Surrey, opening on 18 June.\n\nFollowing the departure of Charterhouse School, its buildings, on the site of the former monastic great cloister, were taken over by Merchant Taylors' School, until that moved out in turn in 1933 to a new site near Northwood, Hertfordshire. The school buildings then became home to the St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School, and (though now much redeveloped) remain one of the sites occupied by its successor, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry. The main part of the cloister garth continues to be a well-tended site mostly laid to lawn in the quadrangle of the university site.\n\nThe principal historic buildings of the Charterhouse were severely damaged by enemy action in May 1941, during the Blitz. They were sensitively restored between 1950 and 1959 under the direction of the architects John Seely and Paul Paget, an exercise which allowed the exposure and embellishment of some medieval and much 16th- and 17th-century fabric that had previously been concealed or obscured. \n\nIn preparation for and in conjunction with the restoration project, archaeological investigations were carried out by W. F. Grimes, which led to a greatly enhanced understanding of the layout of the monastic buildings, and the discovery of the remains of Walter de Manny, the founder, buried in a lead coffin before the high altar of the monastic chapel. These remains were identified as Manny's beyond reasonable doubt by the presence in the coffin of a lead \"bulla\" (seal) of Pope Clement VI: in 1351 Clement had granted Manny a licence to select his own deathbed confessor, a document that would have been issued with just such a \"bulla\" attached.\n\nCharterhouse continues to serve as an almshouse to 40 male pensioners, known as Brothers, who are in need of financial and companionship support. The complex is open for pre-booked guided tours; and the chapel can be viewed as part of the annual Open House London event.\n\nIn partnership with the Museum of London the Charterhouse has opened up the site to the public. There are three key elements to the project: a new museum, which tells the story of the Charterhouse from the Black Death to the present day; a Learning Room and Learning Programme so that school groups can discover how the Charterhouse has been home to everyone from monks and monarchs to schoolboys and Brothers; and a newly landscaped Charterhouse Square open to the public so that more people can enjoy the green surroundings.\n\nWorks for this project were completed and opened to the public in January 2017. Guided tours are available.\n\nCharterhouse was considered to be an extra-parochial area and was not incorporated or included in a district of parishes by the Metropolis Management Act 1855. In 1858, following the Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857, it effectively became a civil parish for all purposes, with the provision that it would not form part of any poor law union. It was later added to the Holborn union in 1877.\n\nIn 1900 it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury, and was abolished as a separate civil parish in 1915. Since 1965 it has been part of the London Borough of Islington in Greater London.\n\nThe nearest tube station is Barbican but Farringdon tube and surface rail station is also close.\n\nList of Masters of Charterhouse since 1611. \n\n\n\n\n"}

She has published five books, including a novel, poetry collection, short story collection, and a memoir. Her narrative and critical writing have been published in a variety of journals and collections. Bociurkiw has also directed and co-directed ten films and videos which have been screened at film festivals on several continents. Her work appears in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, the National Archives of Canada, and many university libraries. She founded or co-founded the media organizations Emma Productions, Winds of Change Productions, and The Studio for Media Activism & Critical Thought. She currently lives in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where she is an associate professor in the RTA School of Media Studies, Ryerson University, Toronto. She teaches courses on social justice media, activist media production, and gender/race/queer theories of time-based and digital media. She is also Director of The Studio for Media Activism & Critical Thought at Ryerson University.\n\nBociurkiw was born in Edmonton, Alberta to Vera Anne (née Wasylyshyn) and Bohdan Rostyslav Bociurkiw. Her father was co-founder of the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies. Ukrainian history and culture were central to Bociurkiw's childhood, and instilled in her a sense of Ukrainian identity and history, as well as a desire to rewrite that history. This is a common thread throughout Bociurkiw's books, essays, and films: reflecting critically and intersectionally on what it means to be Ukrainian, Canadian, feminist, and lesbian.\n\nBociurkiw completed her Bachelor of Fine Arts (1982) at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD) University. While there, she discovered feminist art and the new field of video art. She studied with Bruce Barber and Garry Neill Kennedy. She was part of what Barber has called \"the gathering momentum of a feminist movement at NSCAD\", co-founding the Women Artists' File at the NSCAD Library, which later inspired the Toronto-based Women's Art Resource Centre. She was active on the board of the Centre for Art Tapes in Halifax, where she curated a Toronto-Halifax exchange of activist performance art entitled \"Performance As Resistance\" (1985), which featured dub poets Lillian Allen and Clifton Joseph, humourist Sheila Gostick and Halifax a capella group Four The Moment. After graduating from NSCAD, she moved to Toronto and in 1983, collectively produced the documentary, \"Our Choice, A Tape About Teenage Mothers\" (Women's Media Alliance). In 1984, she co-founded the feminist video collective, Emma Productions, which produced several works, including \"No Small Change: The Story of the Eaton's Strike\" (dir. Ruth Bishop & Marusya Bociurkiw 1985) and \"Bullets for a Revolution\" (dir. Marusya Bociurkiw 1988). These films were produced and screened in the context of the dynamic feminist media culture in 1980's Toronto. These were followed by several single-authored works, including \"Unspoken Territory\", about the history of racial profiling in Canada; and the more recent \"This is Gay Propaganda: LGBT Rights and the War in Ukraine\" (2015). This film uses interviews with LGBT Ukrainians to explore the role of queer activists in Ukraine's Euromaidan Revolution and the Russian occupation that followed. Bociurkiw's films have screened at film festivals on several continents.\n\nBociurkiw is also an award-winning writer and media studies scholar. Her narrative and critical writing have been widely published in such journals and collections as Border/Lines, Fuse, Rites Magazine, The Journey Prize Anthology (McClelland & Stewart), Dykewords (Women's Press), Queer Looks (Routledge), Two Lands, New Vision (Coteau) and Unbound: Ukrainian Canadians Writing Home (University of Toronto Press). In 1994, Bociurkiw published her first book, \"The Woman Who Loved Airports\" (Press Gang) a collection of short stories, followed by a poetry collection, \"Halfway to the East\" (Lazara Press 1999). In 1999, she completed an MA in Social and Political Thought, at York University (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Bociurkiw's creative and scholarly careers have always been intertwined. While teaching sessional positions, completing a PhD in Interdisciplinary Studies at the University of British Columbia (2005) and later working as a Professor in the Radio and Television Arts (RTA) School of Media, Ryerson University (2007 to present), she completed her first novel, \"The Children of Mary\" (Inanna 2006), and her award-winning memoir, \"Comfort Food for Breakups\" (Arsenal 2007). In 2011, she published the academic book, \"Feeling Canadian: Television Nationalism & Affect\" (Wilfrid Laurier University Press).\n\nBociurkiw promotes feminist and anti-racist pedagogy and research through the Studio for Media Activism & Critical Thought, a research hub at Ryerson University that blurs the boundaries between media art, activism, and scholarly investigation. It organizes a yearly speakers' series, symposia, student mentorship, and an online graduate journal. In 2015, the Studio's Speaker Series—which is open to Ryerson students, faculty and the public—featured Indigenous Scholar, Dr. Raven Sinclair; media artist, Deanna Bowen; anti-poverty activists, Cathy Crowe and Dr. Alex Abramovitch; and disability studies scholar and activist, Dr. Eliza Chandler.\n\nAs founder of the feminist video collective Emma Productions, and as an out queer, Bociurkiw was very active in the Toronto and Vancouver feminist movement, peace, and LGBT social movements throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the 1980s, she was active in Women's Action for Peace, International Women's Day Coalition, the pro-choice movement, the Latin American solidarity movement, and Women for Economic Justice While living in Montreal, she co-designed and co-taught the first course on LGBT cinema in Canada, at Concordia University, with Thomas Waugh. She was among the first group of women in Canada to enter the male-dominated field of media art, and to use film and video to draw attention to women's, labour and other issues.\n\nBociurkiw's most recent film—\"This is Gay Propaganda: LGBT Rights and the War in Ukraine—\"highlights the role of LGBT activists in the 2013 Euromaidan and 2014 Ukrainian revolution, which culminated in the expulsion of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. LGBT people in Ukraine had a lot to lose from the rise of Russian political influences there. As a result of the illegal occupation and annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014—bringing it under the Russian LGBT propaganda law—many LGBT Ukrainians from Crimea and Donetsk were forced to flee to safe houses in Kiev and Odessa. Though the law criminalizing same sex sexual activity under Soviet Union law was revoked when Ukraine achieved independence in 1991, there remains a high level of social censure. Political leaders in Ukraine, before and after Euromaidan, have been reluctant to pass anti-discrimination legislation, despite pressure to comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. After many delays, a law banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity was finally passed on November 12, 2015. Russian and religious influences continue to threaten the safety and social recognition of LGBT people in Ukraine. Bociurkiw's film draws attention to this struggle and gives voice to the heroes of the Ukrainian LGBT rights movement.\n\nBociurkiw continues to engage in activist research, teaching, and production; initiating courses like Social Justice Media and #Activism. In 2016, she published the article \"Big Affect: The Ephemeral Archive of Second Wave Feminist Video Collectives in Canada,\" the result of several years' research into Canadian feminist media history and its intersections with broadcast technologies and activism.\n\n\n\nBociurkiw's memoir, \"Comfort Food for Breakups: The Memoir of a Hungry Girl\", received \"Foreword Magazine's\" INDIEFAB Book of the Year Award (2007), the Independent Publisher Book Awards (silver) for Best Autobiography/Memoir (2008); and was short-listed for the Golden Crown Literary Award, Lesbian Short Story Essay Collection, and the prestigious Kobzar Literary Award and the Lambda Literary Award (2008). Bociurkiw was the 2013 recipient of the Deans' Scholarly, Research and Creative Activity Award at Ryerson University. In 2014, she was artist-in-residence at Can Serrat International Artists' Centre in Spain, and a research fellow at the Heinrich Böll Foundation in Kiev, Ukraine. Her short story, \"A Girl, Waiting,\" was short-listed for the 2015 CBC Creative Non-Fiction Award.\n\n"}
{"id": "11842067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11842067", "title": "Mormonism and violence", "text": "Mormonism and violence\n\nThe memory of this violence has affected both the history and the doctrines of the Latter Day Saint movement.\n\nEarly Mormon history is marked by many instances of violence, which have helped to shape the church's views on violence. The first significant instance occurred in Missouri. Mormons who lived there tended to vote as a bloc, which often lead to the unseating of the local political leadership. Differences culminated in hostilities and the eventual issuing of an executive order (often called the Extermination Order) by Missouri governor Lilburn Boggs declaring \"the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State.\" Three days later, a militia unit attacked a Mormon settlement at Haun's Mill, resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen. The Extermination Order was not formally rescinded until 1976.\n\nIn Nauvoo, Illinois, conflict was often based on the tendency of Mormons to \"dominate community, economic, and political life wherever they landed.\" The city of Nauvoo had become the largest in Illinois, the city council was predominantly Mormon, and the Nauvoo Legion (the Mormon militia) continued to grow. Other issues of contention included polygamy, freedom of speech, anti-slavery views during Smith’s presidential campaign, and the deification of man. After the destruction of the press of the \"Nauvoo Expositor\", Joseph Smith was arrested and incarcerated in Carthage Jail where he was killed by a mob on June 27, 1844. The conflict in Illinois became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the Mississippi River in February 1846.\n\nAfter Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, anti-Mormon activists in the Utah Territory convinced President Buchanan that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the United States under the direction of Brigham Young. In response in 1857 Buchanan sent one-third of United States's standing army to Utah in what is known as the Utah War. During the Utah War, the Mountain Meadows Massacre occurred.\n\nReligious justification for capital punishment is not unique to Mormonism .\n\nJoseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was a strong proponent of capital punishment, and he favored execution methods that involved the shedding of blood as retribution for crimes of bloodshed. In 1843, he or his scribe commented that the common execution method in Christian nations was hanging, \"instead of blood for blood according to the law of heaven.\" In a March 4, 1843, debate with church leader George A. Smith, who argued against capital punishment, Smith said that if he ever had the opportunity to enact a death penalty law, he \"was opposed to hanging\" the convict; rather, he would \"shoot him, or cut off his head, spill his blood on the ground, and let the smoke thereof ascend up to God\" . In the church's April 6, 1843, general conference, Smith said he would \"wring a thief's neck off if I can find him. if I cannot bring him to justice any other way.\" Sidney Rigdon, Smith's counselor in the First Presidency, also supported capital punishment involving the spilling of blood, stating, \"There are men standing in your midst that you cant do anything with them but cut their throat & bury them.\" On the other hand, Smith was willing to tolerate the presence of men \"as corrupt as the devil himself\" in Nauvoo, Illinois, who \"had been guilty of murder and robbery,\" in the chance that they might \"come to the waters of baptism through repentance, and redeem a part of their allotted time\" .\n\nBrigham Young, Smith's successor in the LDS Church, initially held views on capital punishment that were similar to those of Smith. On January 27, 1845, he spoke approvingly of Smith's toleration of \"corrupt men\" in Nauvoo who were guilty of murder and robbery on the chance that they might repent and be baptized . On the other hand, on February 25, 1846, after the Saints had left Nauvoo, Young threatened adherents who had stolen wagon cover strings and rail timber with having their throats cut \"when they get out of the settlements where his orders could be executed\". Later that year, Young gave orders that \"when a man is found to be a thief... cut his throat & thro' him in the River.\" Young also stated that the decapitation of repeated sinners \"is the law of God & it shall be executed.\" There are no documented instances of such a sentence being carried out on the Mormon Trail.\n\nIn the Salt Lake Valley, Young acted as the executive authority while the Council of Fifty acted as a legislature. One of his main concerns in the early Mormon settlement was theft, and he swore that \"a thief should not live in the Valley, for he would cut off their heads or be the means of haveing it done as the Lord lived.\" A Mormon listening to one of Young's sermons in 1849 recorded that he said that \"if any one was catched stealing to shoot them dead on the spot and they should not be hurt for it.\"\n\nIn the Utah Territory, there was a law from 1851 to 1888 that allowed persons who were convicted of murder to be executed by decapitation; during that time, no person was executed by that method .\n\n\"Blood atonement\" is the controversial concept that there are certain sins to which the atonement of Jesus does not apply, and before a Mormon who has committed such sins can achieve the highest degree of salvation, he or she must personally atone for the sin by \"hav[ing] their blood spilt upon the ground, that the smoke thereof might ascend to heaven as an offering for their sins\" . Blood atonement was supposed to be voluntarily practiced by the sinner, or it was contemplated as being mandatory in a theoretical theocracy which was planned for the Utah Territory, but it was supposed to be carried out with love and compassion for the sinner, not out of a desire for vengeance . The concept was first taught in the mid-1850s by the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) during the Mormon Reformation, when Brigham Young governed the Utah Territory as a near-theocracy. Even though there was discussion about implementing the doctrine, there is no direct evidence that it was ever practiced by the Mormon leadership in their capacity as the leaders of both church and state . There is inconclusive evidence, however, to suggest that the doctrine was independently enforced a few times by Mormon individuals . Scholars have also argued that the doctrine contributed to a culture of violence, which, combined with paranoia that resulted from the church's long history of being persecuted, incited several extrajudicial killings by Mormons, including the Mountain Meadows Massacre .\n\nLDS Church leaders taught the concept of blood atonement well into the 20th century within the context of government-sanctioned capital punishment, and it was responsible for laws in the state of Utah that allowed prisoners on death row to be executed by firing squad (\"Salt Lake Tribune\", 11 May 1994, p. D1). Although the LDS Church repudiated the teaching in 1978, it still has adherents within the LDS Church as well as adherents within Mormon fundamentalism, a schismatic branch of the Latter Day Saint movement whose adherents seek to follow early Mormon teachings to the letter. Despite its repudiation by the LDS Church, the concept also survives in Mormon culture, particularly with regard to capital crimes. In 1994, when the defense in the trial of James Edward Wood alleged that a local church leader had \"talked to [Wood] about shedding his own blood,\" the LDS Church's First Presidency submitted a document to the court that denied the church's acceptance and practice of such a doctrine, and included the 1978 repudiation.\n\nHistorically, Mormon ritual provided an example in which capital punishment is contemplated, though not necessarily required, for violations of historical blood oaths in the endowment ritual. The blood oaths in the ceremony were related to protecting the ritual's secrecy. Participants made an oath that rather than ever revealing the secret gestures of the ceremony, they would rather have: \"my throat... be cut from ear to ear, and my tongue torn out by its roots,\" \"our breasts... be torn open, our hearts and vitals torn out and given to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field,\" \"your body... be cut asunder and all your bowels gush out,\" showing an entire refusal to accept the promises made in the washing and anointing ordinances . They were changed to a reference to \"different ways in which life may be taken\" . The entire \"penalty\" portion of the ceremony was removed by the LDS Church in 1990, and during its lifetime, there is no documented instance in which a person has been killed for violating the oaths of secrecy.\n\nAfter the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young added an oath of vengeance to the Nauvoo endowment ritual. Participants in the ritual made an oath to pray that God would \"avenge the blood of the prophets on this nation\" . \"The prophets\" were Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and \"this nation\" was the United States . The oath was removed from the ceremony during the 1920s .\n\nIn 1877, Young noted what he viewed as a similarity between Smith's death and the blood atonement doctrine in that \"whether we believe in blood atonement or not,\" Smith and other prophets \"sealed their testimony with their blood.\"\n\nThe widely publicized Mountain Meadows Massacre of September 11, 1857, during the Utah War, was a mass killing of about 130 emigrants, mostly from Arkansas and heading for California. It was led by prominent Mormon leader John D. Lee over a Mormon militia. Lee was later excommunicated and executed for his role in the killings. After escalating rumors that some of the emigrants had participated in early Mormon persecution, the militia attacked the emigrants, forced them to surrender, and killed most of them in cold blood, although a few children did survive. The Mormons forcibly adopted these children and blamed the massacre on largely uninvolved Native Americans.\n\nThough widely connected with the blood atonement doctrine by the United States press and general public, there is no direct evidence that the massacre was related to \"saving\" the emigrants by the shedding of their blood (as they had not entered into Mormon covenants); rather, most commentators view it as an act of intended retribution. Brigham Young was accused with either directing the massacre, or with complicity after the fact. When Young was interviewed on the matter and asked if he believed in blood atonement, he replied, \"I do, and I believe that Lee has not half atoned for his great crime.\" He said \"we believe that execution should be done by the shedding of blood instead of by hanging,\" but only \"according to the laws of the land\" .\n\nAmerican troops who visited the site later constructed a cairn at the site, topped with a sign saying \"Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.\" According to a Mormon present at the even, when Young visited the site sometime afterward, he remarked \"Vengeance is \"mine\", and I have taken a little\"; his party proceeded to destroy the cairn and memorial.\n\nIn its early days, the LDS Church was not a staunch critic of same-sex relationships. The state of Utah did not have a sodomy law until it was imposed on the state by the U.S. federal government. Nonetheless, church leaders have encouraged young male Latter-day Saints to defend themselves, physically if necessary, against sexual assaults by other men. In October 1976, LDS Church apostle Boyd K. Packer gave a sermon entitled \"To Young Men Only\". The sermon was later published as a pamphlet and was widely circulated to LDS young men. Openly gay historian D. Michael Quinn criticized Packer's comments, saying they constituted an endorsement of gay bashing, and he also claimed that the church itself endorses such behavior by continuing to publish Packer's speech.\n\nOn July 5, 2015, the LDS Church issued an official statement in response to the Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage and to clarify its official position of non-violence to the LGBT community:\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us to love and treat all people with kindness and civility—even when we disagree. We affirm that those who avail themselves of laws or court rulings authorizing same-sex marriage should not be treated disrespectfully. Indeed, the Church has advocated for rights of same-sex couples in matters of hospitalization and medical care, fair housing and employment, and probate, so long as these do not infringe on the integrity of the traditional family or the constitutional rights of churches.\n\nSunday July 22, 2018 John O'Connor a member of the Fallon, Neveda ward open fire on fellow worshippers “killing 61-year-old Charles E. “Bert” Miller, a longtime volunteer firefighter” and injuring Bert's brother. \n\nDuring 2014, 15-year-old Mormon Jared Padgett killed a fellow student at their Oregon high school, injured a teacher, and then committed suicide. He was \"a devout Mormon and was ordained as a deacon at age 12.\" People described him as a \"nice kid\" who was the president of his ward’s deacons’ quorum. \n\nMormon writer, Jana Riess expressed much concern about what she describes as \"Mormon Americans’ strange relationship with guns.\"\n\nThis list includes all wars and massacres that have involved significant numbers of members of the Latter Day Saint movement as victims or perpetrators.\n\nThere are many wars mentioned in the Book of Mormon. Battles often occur between peoples called the Nephites and Lamanites, but other groups attacked or drawn into battle included \"secret combinations\" (i.e., organized criminals), factions among the Jaredites, and the Army of Helaman.\n\nThe Book of Mormon concludes with a war between the Nephites and Lamanites. The final prophet of the Book of Mormon, a Nephite named Moroni, laments that his people have participated in sexual violence, torture, and cannibalism:\nAnd notwithstanding this great abomination of the Lamanites, it doth not exceed that of our people in Moriantum. For behold, many of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and after depriving them of that which was most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue—And after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and after they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery.\nSeveral decapitations and dismemberments are also described in the Book of Mormon. In chapter 4 of the First Book of Nephi, the prophet Nephi obeys the Holy Spirit and cuts off the head of Laban. In Ether chapter 15, the warrior Coriantumr, who is the last survivor of the Jaredites, decapitates Shiz. In Alma chapter 17, Ammon (a Nephite missionary) defends a king's livestock by cutting off the arms of several thieves.\n\nIn chapter 9 of the Third Book of Nephi, Jesus announces to ancient Americans that he has destroyed more than a dozen cities and their inhabitants. He announces that he destroyed some cities by causing them \"to be burned with fire because of their sins and their wickedness,\" while others were \"sunk in the depths of the sea\" or \"covered with earth\". The text reports that some of the victims mourned, \"O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared\".\n\nThe Book of Mormon is not unique in describing divinely directed or sanctioned violence. Additional examples appear in the Old Testament, which Mormons also consider to be sacred scripture.\n\n"}

Although the term \"Old Tbilisi\" has long been used to denote a historical part of the city, it was only in 2007 that it became a distinct administrative entity to incorporate several historical neighborhoods formerly included in the districts of Mtatsminda-Krtsanisi, Isani-Samgori, and Didube-Chughureti. The district was abolished in 2013, with its territories allotted to several other divisions of the capital.\n\nOld Tbilisi is principally centered on what is commonly referred to as the Tbilisi Historic District, which, due to its significant architectural and urban value, as well as the threat to its survival, was previously listed on the World Monuments Watch (1998, 2000, 2002).\n\nThe district is located on the both sides of the Kura River and is dominated by Mount Mtatsminda, Narikala fortress and the Kartlis Deda monument. It chiefly represents a 19th-century urban fabric with largely eclectic architecture which includes the buildings and structures from the 5th to the 20th century. However, most of the pre-19th century city did not survive due to the devastating Persian invasion of 1795. The district houses a bulk of the tourist attractions in Tbilisi, including churches, museums, sulphur bathhouses, and peculiar wooden houses with open, carved balconies. In the 19th century, the core territory of the modern-day district of Old Tbilisi was tentatively subdivided into ethnic neighborhoods such as Avlabari with its Armenian and Georgian quarters, Alexanderdorf German quarter on the left bank of the Kura River and the Persian Quarter (Said-Abad) on the right bank of the Kura River.\n\nOld Tbilisi has been the centre of a thriving art community with artist Giovanni Vepkhavadze known for specializing in painting many street scenes in the district.\n\nIn 2010, the government of Tbilisi started a program initiated by Mayor Gigi Ugulava. The idea was to renew old and damaged houses and cobbled streets to make Old Tbilisi more attractive for tourists and visitors.\n\n\n"}

It was published in complete form for the first time by R. W. Chapman in 1926, extracts having appeared in 1871. It has been said that \"in the \"Plan\" and the correspondence from which it arose, we have the most important account of what Jane Austen understood to be her aims and capacities as a novelist\".\n\nIn 1815 Austen met the Rev. James Stanier Clarke in London. He had ideas for her fiction, including a novel to be based on a clergyman with a foothold in urban life, as well as the provincial rural settings she had used so far for clerics in her novels. At the time (October 1815) she was staying with her brother in London negotiating the publication of \"Emma\", which was then dedicated to the Prince Regent through the good offices of Clarke, who was the Prince's librarian. Among Clarke's suggestions was a historical novel on the House of Coburg: Austen side-stepped with a disclaimer about her talents. Clarke recommended that Austen should dedicate \"Emma \"to the Prince Regent. She did this, although she disapproved of his attitude towards his wife.\n\nThe intention of the work was to set down the essential parts of the \"ideal novel\". Austen was following, and guying, the recommendations of Clarke. The work was also influenced by some of Austen's personal circle with views on the novel of courtship, and names are recorded in the margins of the manuscript; they included William Gifford, her publisher, and her niece Fanny Knight.\n\nThe \"Plan\" became a sort of family joke among the Austens. Some of its aspects parody contemporary works by authors such as Sophie Cottin, Fanny Burney, Anna Maria Porter, and Mary Brunton. The satire of the \"Plan\" was analysed by Austen's nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh, in his biography \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" (1869, expanded edition 1871).\n"}

It is to be distinguished from public law, which deals with relationships between both natural and artificial persons (i.e., organizations) and the state, including regulatory statutes, penal law and other law that affects the public order. In general terms, private law involves interactions between private citizens, whereas public law involves interrelations between the state and the general population.\n\nThe concept of private law in common law countries is a little more broad, in that it also encompasses private relationships between governments and private individuals or other entities. That is, relationships between governments and individuals based on the law of contract or torts are governed by private law, and are not considered to be within the scope of public law.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40594", "title": "Pseudonym", "text": "Pseudonym\n\nA pseudonym () or alias () is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their first or true name (orthonym).\n\nPseudonyms include stage names and user names, ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero or villain identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.\n\nPseudonyms should not be confused with new names that replace old ones and become the individual's full-time name. Pseudonyms are \"part-time\" names, used only in certain contexts – usually adopted to hide an individual's real identity, as with writers' pen names, graffiti artists' tags, resistance fighters' or terrorists' \"noms de guerre\", and computer hackers' handles. Actors, musicians, and other performers sometimes use stage names, for example, to mask their ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIn some cases, pseudonyms are adopted because they are part of a cultural or organisational tradition: for example devotional names used by members of some religious institutes, and \"cadre names\" used by Communist party leaders such as Trotsky and Lenin.\n\nA pseudonym may also be used for personal reasons: for example, an individual may prefer to be called or known by a name that differs from their given or legal name, but is not ready to take the numerous steps to get their name legally changed; or an individual may simply feel that the context and content of an exchange offer no reason, legal or otherwise, to provide their given or legal name.\n\nA \"collective name\" or \"collective pseudonym\" is one shared by two or more persons, for example the co-authors of a work, such as Ellery Queen, Nicolas Bourbaki. or James S. A. Corey.\n\nThe term is derived from the Greek (\"pseudṓnymon\"), literally \"false name\", from (\"pseûdos\"), \"lie, falsehood\" and (\"ónoma\"), \"name\".\n\nA pseudonym is distinct from an \"allonym\", which is the (real) name of another person, assumed by the author of a work of art. This may occur when someone is ghostwriting a book or play, or in parody, or when using a \"front\" name, such as by screenwriters blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950s and 1960s. See also pseudepigraph, for \"falsely\" attributed authorship.\n\nSometimes people change their name in such a manner that the new name becomes permanent and is used by all who know the person. This is not an alias or pseudonym, but in fact a new name. In many countries, including common law countries, a name change can be ratified by a court and become a person's new legal name.\n\nFor example, in the 1960s, black civil rights campaigner Malcolm Little changed his surname to \"X\", to represent his unknown African ancestral name that had been lost when his ancestors were brought to North America as slaves. He then changed his name again to Malik El-Shabazz when he converted to Islam. Likewise some Jews adopted Hebrew family names upon immigrating to Israel, dropping surnames that had been in their families for generations. The politician David Ben-Gurion, for example, was born David Grün in Poland. He adopted his Hebrew name in 1910, when he published his first article in a Zionist journal in Jerusalem. Many transgender people also choose to adopt a new name, typically around the time of their social transitioning, to resemble their desired gender better than their birth name.\n\nBusinesspersons of ethnic minorities in some parts of the world are sometimes advised by an employer to use a pseudonym that is common or acceptable in that area when conducting business, to overcome racial or religious bias.\n\nCriminals may use aliases, fictitious business names, and dummy corporations (corporate shells) to hide their identity, or to impersonate other persons or entities in order to commit fraud. Aliases and fictitious business names used for dummy corporations may become so complex that, in the words of the \"Washington Post\", \"getting to the truth requires a walk down a bizarre labyrinth\" and multiple government agencies may become involved to uncover the truth.\n\nA pen name, or \"nom de plume\" (French for \"pen name\"), is a pseudonym (sometimes a particular form of the real name) adopted by an author (or on the author's behalf by their publishers).\n\nSome female authors used male pen names, in particular in the 19th century, when writing was a male-dominated profession. The Brontë family used pen names for their early work, so as not to reveal their gender (see below) and so that local residents would not know that the books related to people of the neighbourhood. The Brontës used their neighbours as inspiration for characters in many of their books. Anne Brontë published \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\" under the name Acton Bell. Charlotte Brontë published \"Shirley\" and \"Jane Eyre\" under the name Currer Bell. Emily Brontë published \"Wuthering Heights\" as Ellis Bell.\nA well-known example of the former is Mary Ann Evans, who wrote as George Eliot. Another example is Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin, a 19th-century French writer who used the pen name George Sand.\n\nIn contrast, some twentieth and twenty first century male romance novelists have used female pen names. A few examples of male authors using female pseudonyms include Brindle Chase, Peter O'Donnell (wrote as Madeline Brent) and Christopher Wood (wrote as Penny Sutton and Rosie Dixon).\n\nA pen name may be used if a writer's real name is likely to be confused with the name of another writer or notable individual, or if their real name is deemed to be unsuitable.\n\nAuthors who write both fiction and non-fiction, or in different genres, may use different pen names to avoid confusing their readers.\n\nIn some cases, an author may become better known by his pen name than his real name.\nOne famous example of this is Samuel Clemens writing under the pen name Mark Twain. British mathematician Charles Dodgson, who wrote fantasy novels under the pen name Lewis Carroll and mathematical treatises under his own name, refused to open letters addressed to him as \"Lewis Carroll\".\n\nSome authors, such as Harold Robbins, use several literary pseudonyms.\n\nSome pen names have been used for long periods, even decades, without the author's true identity being discovered, such as Elena Ferrante and Torsten Krol.\n\nSome pen names are not strictly pseudonyms, as they are simply variants of the authors' actual names. The authors C. L. Moore and S. E. Hinton were female authors who used the initialised forms of their full names. C. L. Moore was Catherine Lucille Moore, who wrote in the 1930s male-dominated science fiction genre, and S. E. Hinton, (author of \"The Outsiders\") is Susan Eloise Hinton. \"Star Trek\" writer D. C. Fontana (Dorothy Catherine) wrote using her abbreviated own name and also under the pen names Michael Richards and J. Michael Bingham. Author V.C. Andrews intended to publish under her given name of Virginia Andrews, but was told that, due to a production error, her first novel was being released under the name of \"V.C. Andrews\"; later she learned that her publisher had in fact done this deliberately. Joanne Kathleen Rowling published the \"Harry Potter\" series under the shortened name J. K. Rowling. Rowling also published the Cormoran Strike series, a series of detective novels including \"The Cuckoo's Calling\" under the pseudonym \"Robert Galbraith\".\n\nWinston Churchill wrote under the pen name Winston S. Churchill (from his full surname \"Spencer-Churchill\" which he did not otherwise use) in an attempt to avoid confusion with the American novelist of the same name. In this case, the attempt was not entirely successful – and the two are still sometimes confused by booksellers.\n\nA pen name may be used specifically to hide the identity of the author, as in the case of exposé books about espionage or crime, or explicit erotic fiction. Some prolific authors adopt a pseudonym to disguise the extent of their published output, e.g. Stephen King writing as Richard Bachman. Co-authors may choose to publish under a collective pseudonym, e.g., P. J. Tracy and Perri O'Shaughnessy. Frederic Dannay and Manfred Lee used the name Ellery Queen as both a pen name for their collaborative works and as the name of their main character.\n\nA famous case in French literature was Romain Gary. Already a well-known and highly acclaimed writer, he started publishing books under the pen name Émile Ajar. He wanted to test whether his new books would be well received on their own merits and without the aid of his established reputation, and they were: Émile Ajar, like Romain Gary before him, was awarded the prestigious Prix Goncourt by a jury unaware that both were the same person. Similarly, Ronnie Barker submitted comedy material under the name of Gerald Wiley.\n\nA collective pseudonym may represent an entire publishing house, or any contributor to a long-running series, especially with juvenile literature. Examples include Watty Piper, Victor Appleton, Erin Hunter, and Kamiru M. Xhan.\n\nAnother use of a pseudonym in literature is to present a story as being written by the fictional characters in the story. The series of novels known as \"A Series Of Unfortunate Events\" are written by Daniel Handler under the pen name of Lemony Snicket, a character in the series.\n\nAn anonymity pseudonym or multiple-use name is a name used by many different people to protect anonymity. It is a strategy that has been adopted by many unconnected radical groups and by cultural groups, where the construct of personal identity has been criticised. This has led to the idea of the \"open pop star\".\n\nPseudonyms and acronyms are often employed in medical research to protect subjects' identities through a process known as de-identification.\n\nIn Ancien Régime France, a \"nom de guerre\" (\"war name\") would be adopted by each new recruit (or assigned to them by the captain of their company) as they enlisted in the French army. These pseudonyms had an official character and were the predecessor of identification numbers: soldiers were identified by their first names, their family names, and their \"noms de guerre\" (e.g. \"Jean Amarault dit Lafidélité\"). These pseudonyms were usually related to the soldier's place of origin (e.g. \"Jean Deslandes dit Champigny\", for a soldier coming from a town named Champigny), or to a particular physical or personal trait (e.g. \"Antoine Bonnet dit Prettaboire\", for a soldier \"prêt à boire\", ready to drink). In 1716, a \"nom de guerre\" was mandatory for every soldier; officers did not adopt \"noms de guerre\" as they considered them derogatory. In daily life, these aliases could replace the real family name.\n\n\"Noms de guerre\" were adopted for security reasons by members of the World War II French resistance and Polish resistance. Such pseudonyms are often adopted by military special forces soldiers, such as members of the SAS and other similar units, resistance fighters, terrorists, and guerrillas. This practice hides their identities and may protect their families from reprisals; it may also be a form of dissociation from domestic life. Some well-known men who adopted \"noms de guerre\" include Carlos, for Ilich Ramírez Sánchez; Willy Brandt, Chancellor of West Germany; and Subcomandante Marcos, the spokesman of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN). During Lehi's underground fight against the British in Mandatory Palestine, the organization's commander Yitzchak Shamir (later Prime Minister of Israel) adopted the \"nom de guerre\" \"Michael\", in honour of Ireland's Michael Collins.\n\nRevolutionaries and resistance leaders, such as Lenin, Trotsky, Golda Meir, Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, and Josip Broz Tito, often adopted their \"noms de guerre\" as their proper names after the struggle. George Grivas, the Greek-Cypriot EOKA militant, adopted the \"nom de guerre\" Digenis (Διγενής). In the French Foreign Legion, recruits can adopt a pseudonym to break with their past lives. Mercenaries have long used \"noms de guerre\", even sometimes multiple identities depending on country, conflict and circumstance. Some of the most familiar noms de guerre today are the kunya used by Islamic mujahideen. These take the form of a teknonym, either literal or figurative.\n\nIndividuals using a computer online may adopt or be required to use a form of pseudonym known as a \"handle\" (a term deriving from CB slang), \"user name\", \"login name\", \"avatar\", or, sometimes, \"screen name\", \"gamertag\" \"IGN (In Game (Nick)Name)\" or \"nickname\". On the Internet, pseudonymous remailers use cryptography that achieves persistent pseudonymity, so that two-way communication can be achieved, and reputations can be established, without linking physical identities to their respective pseudonyms. Aliasing is the use of multiple names for the same data location.\n\nMore sophisticated cryptographic systems, such as anonymous digital credentials, enable users to communicate pseudonymously (i.e., by identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms). In well-defined abuse cases, a designated authority may be able to revoke the pseudonyms and reveal the individuals' real identity.\n\nUse of pseudonyms is common among professional eSports players, despite the fact that many professional games are played on LAN.\n\nPeople seeking privacy often use pseudonyms to make appointments and reservations. Those writing to advice columns in newspapers and magazines may use pseudonyms. Steve Wozniak used a pseudonym when attending the University of California, Berkeley after cofounding Apple Computer because, he said, \"I knew I wouldn't have time enough to be an A+ student.\"\n\nWhen used by an actor, musician, radio disc jockey, model, or other performer or \"show business\" personality a pseudonym is called a \"stage name\", or, occasionally, a \"professional name\", or \"screen name\".\n\nMembers of a marginalized ethnic or religious group have often adopted stage names, typically changing their surname or entire name to mask their original background.\n\nStage names are also used to create a more marketable name, as in the case of Creighton Tull Chaney, who adopted the pseudonym Lon Chaney, Jr., a reference to his famous father Lon Chaney, Sr.\n\nChris Curtis of Deep Purple fame was christened as Christopher Crummey. In this and similar cases a stage name is adopted simply to avoid an unfortunate pun.\n\nPseudonyms are also used to comply with the rules of performing arts guilds (Screen Actors Guild (SAG), Writers Guild of America, East (WGA), AFTRA, etc.), which do not allow performers to use an existing name, in order to avoid confusion. For example, these rules required film and television actor Michael Fox to add a middle initial and become Michael J. Fox, to avoid being confused with another actor named Michael Fox. This was also true of author and actress Fannie Flagg, who chose this pseudonym; her real name, Patricia Neal, being the name of another well-known actress; and British actor Stewart Granger, whose real name was James Stewart. The film-making team of Joel and Ethan Coen, for instance, share credit for editing under the alias Roderick Jaynes. Another example is that actor Gary Morgan used his fictional name \"Barnard Panansky\" in the Kidsongs' I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing video while in Kidsongs: Very Silly Songs, his actual name appears in the credits.\n\nSome stage names are used to conceal a person's identity, such as the pseudonym Alan Smithee, which was used by directors in the Directors Guild of America (DGA) to remove their name from a film they feel was edited or modified beyond their artistic satisfaction. In theatre, the pseudonyms George or Georgina Spelvin, and Walter Plinge are used to hide the identity of a performer, usually when he or she is \"doubling\" (playing more than one role in the same play).\n\nDavid Agnew was a name used by the BBC to conceal the identity of a scriptwriter, such as for the Doctor Who serial City of Death, which had 3 writers, including Douglas Adams, who was at the time of writing the show's Script Editor. In another Doctor Who serial, The Brain of Morbius, writer Terrance Dicks demanded the removal of his name from the credits saying it could go out under a \"bland pseudonym\". This ended up being the name \"Robin Bland\".\n\nMusicians and singers can use pseudonyms to allow artists to collaborate with artists on other labels while avoiding the need to gain permission from their own labels, such as the artist Jerry Samuels, who made songs under Napoleon XIV. Rock singer-guitarist George Harrison, for example, played guitar on Cream's song \"Badge\" using a pseudonym. In classical music, some record companies issued recordings under a \"nom de disque\" in the 1950s and 1960s to avoid paying royalties. A number of popular budget LPs of piano music were released under the pseudonym Paul Procopolis. Another example is that Paul McCartney used his fictional name \"Bernerd Webb\" for Peter and Gordon's song Woman.\n\nPseudonyms are also used as stage names in heavy metal bands, such as Tracii Guns in LA Guns, Axl Rose and Slash in Guns N' Roses, Mick Mars in Mötley Crüe, Dimebag Darrell in Pantera, or C.C. Deville in Poison. Some of these names have additional meanings, like that of Brian Hugh Warner, more commonly known as Marilyn Manson: Marilyn coming from Marilyn Monroe and Manson from convicted serial killer Charles Manson. Jacoby Shaddix of Papa Roach went under the name \"Coby Dick\" during the \"Infest\" era. He changed back to his birth name when \"lovehatetragedy\" was released.\n\nDavid Johansen, frontman for the hard rock band New York Dolls, recorded and performed pop and lounge music under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The music video for Poindexter's debt single, Hot Hot Hot, opens with a monologue from Johansen where he notes his time with the New York Dolls and explains his desire to create more sophisticated music. \n\nRoss Bagdasarian, Sr., creator of Alvin and the Chipmunks, wrote original songs, arranged, and produced the records under his real name, but performed on them as David Seville. He also wrote songs using the name Skipper Adams. Danish pop pianist Bent Fabric, whose full name is Bent Fabricius-Bjerre, wrote his biggest instrumental hit \"Alley Cat\" under the name Frank Bjorn.\n\nFor a time, the musician Prince used an unpronounceable \"Love Symbol\" as a pseudonym (\"Prince\" is his actual first name rather than a stage name). He wrote the song \"Sugar Walls\" for Sheena Easton under the alias \"Alexander Nevermind\" and \"Manic Monday\" for The Bangles as \"Christopher Tracy\" (he also produced albums early in his career as \"Jamie Starr\").\n\nMany Italian-American singers have used stage names as their birth names were difficult to pronounce, or considered too ethnic for American tastes. Singers changing their names included Dean Martin (born Dino Paul Crocetti), Connie Francis (born Concetta Franconero), Frankie Valli (born Francesco Castelluccio), Tony Bennett (born Anthony Benedetto), and Lady Gaga (born Stefani Germanotta)\n\nIn 2009, British rock band Feeder briefly changed their name to Renegades so they could play a whole show featuring a setlist in which 95 percent of the songs played were from their forthcoming new album of the same name, with none of their singles included. Frontman Grant Nicholas felt that if they played as Feeder, there would be an uproar that they did not play any of the singles, so used the pseudonym as a hint. A series of small shows were played in 2010, at 250- to 1,000-capacity venues with the plan not to say who the band really are and just announce the shows as if they were a new band.\n\nIn many cases, hip-hop and rap artist prefer to use pseudonyms that represents some variation of their name, personality, or interests. Prime examples include Iggy Azalea (her name comes from her dog name, Iggy, and her home street in Mullumbimby, Azalea street) Ol' Dirty Bastard (who was known under at least six aliases), Diddy (previously known at various times as Puffy, P. Diddy, and Puff Daddy), Ludacris, Flo Rida (his name is a tribute to his home state, Florida), LL Cool J, and Chingy. Black metal artists also adopt pseudonyms, usually symbolizing dark values, such as Nocturno Culto, Gaahl, Abbath, and Silenoz. In punk and hardcore punk, singers and band members often replace their real names with \"tougher\"-sounding stage names, such as Sid Vicious (real name John Simon Ritchie) of the late 1970s band Sex Pistols and \"Rat\" of the early 1980s band The Varukers and the 2000s re-formation of Discharge. Punk rock band The Ramones also had every member take the last name of Ramone.\n\nHenry John Deutschendorf Jr., an American singer-songwriter used the stage name John Denver. The Australian country musician born Robert Lane changed his name to Tex Morton. Reginald Kenneth Dwight legally changed his name to Elton John in 1972.\n\n\n\n"}

Page\n\nRaymond Ian Page (25 September 1924 – 10 March 2012) was a British historian of Anglo-Saxon England and the Viking Age, and a renowned runologist who specialised in the study of Anglo-Saxon runes.\n\nPage was born in Sheffield in 1924, and was educated at King Edward VII School. His family circumstances required him to leave school at the age of 16. In 1942 he took a course in mechanical engineering at Rotherham Technical College, applying thereafter for a commission in the Royal Navy. After the war, on discharge from the Navy, he was able as an ex-serviceman to obtain a place as an undergraduate at the University of Sheffield. After graduating in English, he spent a year in Copenhagen working on an MA and then moved to the University of Nottingham, where he was appointed to an assistant lectureship in English in 1951 and completed his doctoral dissertation on \"The Inscriptions of the Anglo-Saxon Rune-Stones\" in 1959.\n\nIn 1962, Page joined the faculty at the University of Cambridge, where he was a lecturer, and later reader, in Old Norse language and literature. In 1965 he was appointed Parker Librarian at the Parker Library, Corpus Christi College, and in 1984 he was appointed Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon. He held these two prestigious posts until his retirement in 1991. He continued to work at Corpus Christi after his retirement in an out-of-the-way office which he called 'Paradise' because it was so hard to reach.\n\nRudolf Simek said that Page \"is widely acknowledged as \"the\" authority on Old English runes\". Professor Elmer Antonsen of the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign has noted that \"serious study of English runes without Raymond Ian Page... is simply inconceivable\"; others praise him as a \"meticulous scholar\". Page's \"An Introduction to English Runes\" was first published in 1973, and revised and republished in 1999. Page intended it as a prefatory publication to a complete corpus edition of Anglo-Saxon runes, and it was praised for, among other qualities, its \"healthy skepticism\". Even in 2003, it remained \"the only book-length study providing a comprehensive and scholarly guide to the Anglo-Saxon use of runes\", and the revised edition was deemed as authoritative as the first one was in the 1970s. Much of his work was aimed at a general readership, but many of his scholarly articles were collected in 1995 in \"Runes and Runic Inscriptions: Collected Essays on Anglo-Saxon and Viking Runes.\"\n\nPage called himself a 'sceptical' runologist, demonstrating that runes were most often used for mundane purposes and arguing against their 'romantic' association with the occult.\n\nIn 1996 he was awarded an honorary doctorate at The Norwegian University of Sceince and Technology (NTNU).\n\nIn 1953 Page married Elin Hustad; they had two daughters and a son. True to his Yorkshire roots, he would not permit red roses in his garden. Known as a connoisseur of real ale and single-malt whisky, he was presented on his 70th birthday with an oak manuscript conservation box specially made to contain a bottle of whisky, with its spine embossed with the title \"The Runes of Jura\".\n\n"}

Its supporters included George Galloway, Ken Loach, Victoria Brittain, Salma Yaqoob and Nick Wrack.\n\nIn September 2007, Galloway wrote a letter to Respect's national council members saying that the party was \"too disorganised\" and \"faced oblivion\" unless it reformed its internal party management. This was the beginning of a dispute within Respect between Galloway and his supporters and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) on the other side.\n\nOn 3 November 2007, Galloway's camp announced plans to hold the Respect Renewal conference on 17 November, the same day as the planned national conference of Respect. The Respect Renewal conference was an open event and organisers claim 350 people attended, comparable with the Respect national conference, although the figure was disputed by Chris Harman in the SWP's \"International Socialism\". This split continued with both Respect Renewal and the SWP-led faction claiming to be the real Respect. Respect Renewal, through Linda Smith, had control over the use of the Respect name in elections, while the SWP-led faction used the electoral label Left List, but did control the original Respect website. Both the Respect Renewal faction, as 'Respect (George Galloway)', and Left List stood in the 2008 London Assembly elections. Neither party won a seat or did as well as Respect did in the 2004 elections, but 'Respect (George Galloway)' outpolled Left List.\n\nThe split was finally resolved in October 2008, when the Left List ended its claim on the Respect name.\n\nThe SWP has attributed the split within Respect to a shift to the right by George Galloway and his allies, motivated by electoralism (placing election-winning above other principles). This, according to the SWP leadership, led to attacks on the SWP as the most prominent left group in Respect. This interpretation of events is countered by Respect Renewal, which criticises the SWP for opportunism and lack of democracy.\n\n"}

{"id": "623112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=623112", "title": "Robotic mapping", "text": "Robotic mapping\n\nRobotic mapping is a discipline related to computer vision and cartography. The goal for an autonomous robot is to be able to construct (or use) a map (outdoor use) or floor plan (indoor use) and to localize itself and its recharging bases or beacons in it. Robotic mapping is that branch which deals with the study and application of ability to localize itself in a map / plan and sometimes to \nconstruct the map or floor plan by the autonomous robot.\nEvolutionarily shaped blind action may suffice to keep some animals alive. For some insects for example, the environment is not interpreted as a map, and they survive only with a triggered response. A slightly more elaborated navigation strategy dramatically enhances the capabilities of the robot. Cognitive maps enable planning capacities and use of current perceptions, memorized events, and expected consequences.\n\nThe robot has two sources of information: the idiothetic and the allothetic sources. When in motion, a robot can use dead reckoning methods such as tracking the number of revolutions of its wheels; this corresponds to the idiothetic source and can give the absolute position of the robot, but it is subject to cumulative error which can grow quickly.\n\nThe allothetic source corresponds the sensors of the robot, like a camera, a microphone, laser, lidar or sonar. The problem here is \"perceptual aliasing\". This means that two different places can be perceived as the same. For example, in a building, it is nearly impossible to determine a location solely with the visual information, because all the corridors may look the same. 3-dimensional models of a robot's environment can be generated using 3D scanners.\n\nThe internal representation of the map can be \"metric\" or \"topological\": \n\nMany techniques use probabilistic representations of the map, in order to handle uncertainty.\n\nThere are three main methods of map representations, i.e., free space maps, object maps, and composite maps. These employ the notion of a grid, but permit the resolution of the grid to vary so that it can become finer where more accuracy is needed and more coarse where the map is uniform.\n\nMap learning cannot be separated from the localization process, and a difficulty arises when errors in localization are incorporated into the map. This problem is commonly referred to as Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM).\n\nAn important additional problem is to determine whether the robot is in a part of environment already stored or never visited. One way to solve this problem is by using electric beacons, Near field communication (NFC), WiFi, Visible light communication (VLC) and Li-Fi and Bluetooth. \n\nPath planning is an important issue as it allows a robot to get from point A to point B. Path planning algorithms are measured by their computational complexity. The feasibility of real-time motion planning is dependent on the accuracy of the map (or floorplan), on robot localization and on the number of obstacles. Topologically, the problem of path planning is related to the shortest path problem of finding a route between two nodes in a graph.\n\nOutdoor robots can use GPS in a similar way to automotive navigation systems.\n\nAlternative systems can be used with floor plan and beacons instead of maps for indoor robots, combined with localization wireless hardware. Electric beacons can help for cheap robot navigational systems.\n\n"}

The Foundation focuses on the histories of the United States and the Holy Land, with emphasis on the people and events of the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\nThe Shapell Manuscript Collection is a private holding of primary source documents relating to various events and historical figures in American, Jewish, and Holy Land history. Included in the Collection are signed documents, photographs and rare books. It is particularly rich with items from the Civil War era, Mark Twain, Albert Einstein, and many other historical figures. Among the many noteworthy items are exceptional letters written by George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and John F. Kennedy.\n\nThe Shapell Manuscript Foundation's website offers a large digitized selection of the Collection online for public viewing and research. The online Collection is continuously expanding its offerings of primary source documents and historical artifacts as the digitization process continues.\n\nThe Shapell Roster Project is the ongoing research of Jewish Civil War soldiers and their stories. As part of the Foundation's contribution to the Civil War Sesquicentennial Celebration, the Shapell Manuscript Foundation is preparing a new roster of Jewish Civil War soldiers. The Roster is based on a parallel section in Simon Wolf's book, The American Jew as Soldier, Patriot and Citizen, (1895), but uses modern research tools and technology to expand and correct the almost 120-year-old roster.\n\nIn addition, the Roster will provide documentation (letters, photographs and official documents) for each soldier discussed in the list. At the completion of the project all information and documents will be available online as well as be available in book form. The Roster is scheduled to be published in 2017.\n\nIn addition to a general focus on the historic manuscripts of universally recognized world-renowned individuals, the foundation's collection frequently relates to the history of American Jewish life. The collected manuscripts explore such topics as the lives of Jewish soldiers during the American Civil War and other topics which bring light to bear on the role of American Jews on the general society around them.\n\nThe documents and artifacts in the Foundation's holdings have been on display at various exhibitions internationally. While the Foundation produces its own exhibitions, it also serves as a resource for other institutions' research efforts and exhibitions. The Foundation has collaborated with various historical institutes by creating and enhancing exhibitions with items on loan, and by contributing original research.\n\nThe Foundation regularly exhibits at the National Library of Israel at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The administrative offices are located in the United States and Israel.\nSMF loaned items to the Library of Congress for the traveling exhibition \"With Malice Toward None: The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Exhibition.\" The exhibition toured from February 2009 until April 2011 and included letters written by Lincoln, signed portraits and more.\n\nFrom December 2010 to March 2013 SMF collaborated on the joint exhibition at the National Library of Israel for the exhibit: \"Dreamland: American Travelers to the Holy Land in the 19th Century.\" A sequel to that exhibition, \"Dreams and Diplomacy in the Holy Land: American Consuls in Jerusalem in the 19th Century,\" opened in March 2013 and closed March, 2016.\n\nThe Smithsonian National Museum of American History exhibited several documents on loan from SMF at the exhibition: \"Changing America: The Emancipation Proclamation, 1863, and the March on Washington, 1963\" held from December 2012 until September 2013.\n\nIn 2015, SMF presented \"With Firmness in the Right: Lincoln and the Jews\" in collaboration with the New-York Historical Society and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. The exhibition was produced in conjunction with the publication of the book, Lincoln and the Jews: A History, which contains original research and was co-authored by Professor Jonathan D.

Cullen Davis\n\nThomas Cullen Davis (born September 22, 1933, Fort Worth, Texas) is an American oil heir and member of a prominent family. Davis is best known for being acquitted of murder and attempted murder in two high-profile trials during the 1970s. At the time of his first trial, Davis was believed to be the wealthiest man to have stood trial for murder in the United States.\n\nFirst he was accused of murdering his stepdaughter on August 2, 1976, during a contentious divorce from his second wife, Priscilla Davis. He was found not guilty. The second trial, two years later, involved allegations that Davis attempted to hire a hitman to kill both Priscilla and the judge overseeing his divorce from Priscilla. Again, Davis was acquitted.\n\nThomas Cullen Davis was one of three siblings, all male. His father founded KenDavis Industries International, Inc., which manufactured goods used in the petroleum industry.\n\nDavis and his brothers received equal shares of their father's estate upon his death, and all three were described as possessing keen business instincts. At the first trial, Davis's wealth was estimated at over $100 million ($ million today).\n\nDavis had a reputation in Fort Worth society circles for displays of bad temper and general \"creepiness\", according to female associates. Davis' second marriage was to Priscilla Lee Childers. They were married on August 29, 1968, only hours after the death of his father. It was her third marriage. Priscilla had one daughter from her first marriage, and two children from her second marriage, including Andrea Wilborn.\n\nIn 1972, Davis spent $6 million ($ million today) to build Stonegate Mansion, a five-bedroom, 11-bath mansion with an indoor pool and a master bedroom. In its prime, the luxurious, contemporary home of courtyards, tunnels and balconies at 4100 Mockingbird Lane was decorated with more than 100 oil paintings. The mansion was designed by Albert S. Komatsu and Associates.\n\nDavis and Childers separated in 1974 and both began dating other people openly. A judge granted Priscilla the right to live in the Stonegate property during the divorce proceedings and further authorized substantial spousal and child support payments from Davis to Childers. Her live-in boyfriend was Stan Farr, a former basketball star at nearby Texas Christian University.\n\nOn August 2, 1976, an intruder entered Stonegate Mansion and killed 12-year-old Andrea, who was home alone after returning from a Bible study. The body of Andrea would later be found in the basement, apparently shot execution-style. \n\nWhen Childers and her then-boyfriend Stan Farr returned home, both were shot. Farr died at the scene. Childers staggered from the house being pursued by the killer as two family friends, Beverly Bass and Gus Gavrel, Jr., drove up to the mansion. The killer shot Gavrel, paralyzing him for life.\n\nChilders identified Davis to police, saying he had shot her and Farr, wearing no disguise except a wig. Gavrel said he was shot after his companion recognized the gunman as Davis and called him by name. Police arrested Davis that same night, at the home he shared with Karen Master, his then-girlfriend who would become his third wife.\n\nDavis was only tried for the murder of Andrea. He was defended by famous Texas defense attorney Richard \"Racehorse\" Haynes. The prosecution case relied almost entirely on eyewitness testimony. Earlier the day of the shooting, a judge had ordered Davis's monthly support to Priscilla increased from $3500 to $5000 ($ to $ today) and to pay her legal fees of $25,000 ($ today) and household expenses of $24,000 ($ today). \n\nThis change was proposed as a motive for the crimes. Davis did not testify in his own defense. Haynes's defense concentrated on two main points. First, the complete lack of physical evidence linking Davis to the crime (no fingerprints, no firearm linked to the murder, etc.). \n\nSecond, Haynes focused on the eyewitness testimony, particularly Priscilla. Haynes depicted her as living in two worlds: Fort Worth high society, and a milieu of drug dealers, criminals and sleazy sex. Haynes proposed that Priscilla's admitted heavy use of prescription painkillers made her an unreliable witness who might have been confused about the identity of her attacker. \n\nJournalist George Cartwright wrote: \"most observers agreed later that the case was won as soon as Haynes completed his cross-examination of Priscilla\"; this occurred only two weeks into a three-month trial. Davis was found not guilty. Of the trial, prosecutor Tim Curry said, \"We were out-bought and out-thought\".\n\nIn related civil litigation concerning Wilborn's death following the murder trial, Davis prevailed and was held not liable for her death. The children of Stan Farr later sued Davis for wrongful death and received a $250,000 out of court settlement.\n\nIn 1978, Davis was arrested again, this time for allegedly hiring a hitman to murder both Priscilla Davis and the judge overseeing their ongoing divorce litigation.\n\nThe case largely hinged on a tape-recorded conversation between Davis and David McCrory, an undercover employee posing as a hitman for hire which was recorded in the parking lot of the Denny's restaurant where Davis was arrested. In the recording, Davis was alleged to have asked the undercover employee to murder his wife and the judge. The trial of \"Texas v. Cullen T. Davis\" was one of the first uses of forensic discourse analysis on tape-recorded evidence in a legal setting in the United States. \n\nA discourse analyst testified that Davis' words in the tape did not constitute solicitation of murder. Haynes again defended Davis. He again attacked the prosecution's physical evidence: Davis's fingerprints were not found on critical pieces of evidence, such as the cash he allegedly paid to the McCrory. Unlike the first trial, Davis testified in his own defense. He stated that he had not solicited McCrory's offer to kill Priscilla and the judge, and claimed it was a plot orchestrated by her to frame him. Davis claimed he merely played along with the plot in an attempt to eventually convince McCrory to admit that Priscilla was to blame for the entire scheme. \n\nUnlike the first trial where observers were convinced that David would likely be acquitted, opinion was split in the second trial with the general consensus being that Davis's best hope was a hung jury. After a lengthy trial Davis was acquitted a second time.\n\nAccording to truTV, Davis lost most of his oil fortune in the recession of the 1980s, and eventually declared bankruptcy. Cullen and Karen Davis sold their home and property to a real estate developer in 1984. Davis continues to live in the Fort Worth area, while his wife Karen died of organ failure on September 22, 2016. Davis in later life became a born-again Christian, and at one point worked with controversial televangelist James Robison.\n\nPriscilla Lee Childers died of breast cancer on February 19, 2001, still adamantly insisting on Davis' guilt.\n\nIn books, the case has been addressed in:\n\nOn television, the case has been profiled on:\n"}
{"id": "37258993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37258993", "title": "United States involvement in regime change", "text": "United States involvement in regime change\n\nUnited States involvement in regime change has entailed both overt and covert actions aimed at altering, replacing, or preserving foreign governments. In the latter half of the 19th century, the U.S. government initiated actions for regime change mainly in Latin America and the southwest Pacific, and included the Mexican–American, Spanish–American and Philippine–American wars. At the onset of the 20th century the United States shaped or installed friendly governments in many countries including Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War II, the U.S. government expanded the geographic scope of its actions to foster regime change, as the country struggled with the Soviet Union for global leadership and influence within the context of the Cold War. Significant operations included the U.S. and UK-orchestrated 1953 Iranian coup d'état, the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion targeting Cuba, the anti-communist purge in Indonesia, and support for the Argentinian Dirty War, in addition to the U.S.'s traditional area of operations, Central America and the Caribbean. In addition, the U.S. has interfered in the national elections of many countries, including in Japan in the 1950s and 1960s to keep its preferred center-right Liberal Democratic Party in power using secret funds, in the Philippines to orchestrate the campaign of Ramon Magsaysay for president in 1953, and in Lebanon to help Christian parties in the 1957 elections using secret cash infusions. The U.S. has executed at least 81 overt and covert known interventions in foreign elections during the period 1946–2000.\n\nAlso after World War II, the United States in 1945 ratified the UN Charter, the preeminent international law document, which legally bound the U.S. government to the Charter's provisions, including Article 2(4), which prohibits the threat or use of force in international relations, except in very limited circumstances. Therefore, any legal claim advanced to justify regime change by a foreign power carries a particularly heavy burden.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States has led or supported wars to determine the governance of a number of countries. Stated U.S. aims in these conflicts have included fighting the War on Terror as in the 2001 Afghan war, or removing dictatorial and hostile regimes in the 2003 Iraq War and 2011 military intervention in Libya.\n\nThe Mexican–American War was an armed conflict between the United States of America and Mexico from 1846 to 1848 in the wake of the 1845 U.S. annexation of Texas, which Mexico considered part of its territory despite the 1836 Texas Revolution.\n\nAmerican forces occupied New Mexico and California, then invaded parts of Northeastern Mexico and Northwestern Mexico; Another American army captured Mexico City, and the war ended with a victory for the United States. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the major consequence of the war: the forced Mexican Cession of the territories of Alta California and New Mexico to the U.S. in exchange for $18 million. In addition, the United States forgave debt owed by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico accepted the loss of Texas and thereafter cited the Rio Grande as its national border. The war did not result in a regime change in Mexico.\n\nThe Samoan crisis was a confrontation between the United States, Germany and Great Britain from 1887 to 1889, with the powers backing rival claimants to the throne of the Samoan Islands during the Samoan Civil War. The Second Samoan Civil War followed in 1898, involving the US (who backed the incumbent king) and Germany, eventually resulting, via the Tripartite Convention of 1899, in the partition of the Samoan Islands into American Samoa and German Samoa.\n\nAnti-monarchial elements, mostly Americans, in Hawaii, engineered the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. On January 17, 1893, the native monarch, Queen Lili'uokalani, was overthrown. Hawaii was initially reconstituted as an independent republic, but the ultimate goal of the action was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which was finally accomplished in 1898.\n\nAs part of the Spanish–American War, the United States invaded and occupied Spanish-ruled Cuba and Puerto Rico in 1898. Cuba was occupied by the U.S. from 1898 to 1902 under military governor Leonard Wood, and again from 1906 to 1909, in 1912 and from 1917 to 1922; governed by the terms of the Platt Amendment through 1934.\nThe Puerto Rican Campaign was an American military sea and land operation on the island of Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War. The United States Navy attacked the archipelago's colonial capital, San Juan. Though the damage inflicted on the city was minimal, the Americans were able to establish a blockade in the city's harbor, San Juan Bay. The land offensive began on July 25 with 1,300 infantry soldiers. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President William McKinley and French Ambassador Jules Cambon, acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an armistice whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Philippines and Guam.\n\nThe Philippine–American War was part of a series of conflicts in the Philippine struggle for independence against United States occupation. Fighting erupted between US and Filipino revolutionary forces on February 4, 1899, and quickly escalated into the 1899 Battle of Manila. On June 2, 1899, the First Philippine Republic officially declared war against the United States. The war officially ended on July 4, 1902. This US intervention was intended to prevent regime change, and retain US control over the Philippines.\n\nThe Boxer Rebellion was a proto-nationalist movement in China between 1898 and 1901, so called because it was led by fighters who called themselves the Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists. The United States was part of an Eight-Nation Alliance that brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Chinese Army, and captured Beijing. The Eight-Nation Alliance was a military coalition formed to defeat the rebellion, and the eight nations, in addition to the US, were Japan, Russia, Britain, France, the Germany, Italy and Austria-Hungary.\nThe Boxer Protocol of September 7, 1901 ended the uprising. This intervention did not result in regime change in China.\n\nIn 1903, the U.S. aided the secession of Panama from the Republic of Colombia. The secession was engineered by a Panamanian faction backed by the Panama Canal Company, a French–US corporation whose aim was the construction of a waterway across the Isthmus of Panama thus connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In 1903, the U.S. signed the Hay-Herrán Treaty with Colombia, granting the United States use of the Isthmus of Panama in exchange for financial compensation. amidst the Thousand Days' War. The Panama Canal was already under construction, and the Panama Canal Zone was carved out and placed under United States sovereignty. The US did not transfer the zone back to Panama until 2000.\n\nIn what became known as the \"Banana Wars,\" between the end of the Spanish–American War in 1898 and the inception of the Good Neighbor Policy in 1934, the U.S. staged many military invasions and interventions in Central America and the Caribbean. The United States Marine Corps, which most often fought these wars, developed a manual called \"The Strategy and Tactics of Small Wars\" in 1921 based on its experiences. On occasion, the Navy provided gunfire support and Army troops were also used. The United Fruit Company and Standard Fruit Company dominated Honduras' key banana export sector and associated land holdings and railways. The U.S. staged invasions and incursions of US troops in 1903 (supporting a coup by Manuel Bonilla), 1907 (supporting Bonilla against a Nicaraguan-backed coup), 1911 and 1912 (defending the regime of Miguel R. Davila from an uprising), 1919 (peacekeeping during a civil war, and installing the caretaker government of Francisco Bográn), 1920 (defending the Bográn regime from a general strike), 1924 (defending the regime of Rafael López Gutiérrez from an uprising) and 1925 (defending the elected government of Miguel Paz Barahona) to defend US interests. Writer O. Henry coined the term \"Banana republic\" in 1904 to describe Honduras.\n\nThe U.S. government invaded Nicaragua in 1912 after intermittent US military landings and naval bombardments in the previous decades. The U.S. was providing political support to conservative-led forces who were rebelling against President José Santos Zelaya, a liberal. U.S. motives included disagreement with the proposed Nicaragua Canal, since the U.S. controlled the Panama Canal Zone, which included the Panama Canal, and President Zelaya's attempts to regulate access by foreigners to Nicaraguan natural resources. On November 17, 1909, two Americans were executed by order of Zelaya after the two men confessed to having laid a mine in the San Juan River with the intention of blowing up the \"Diamante\". The U.S. justified the intervention by claiming to protect American lives and property. Zelaya resigned later that year. The U.S. occupied the country almost continuously from 1912 through 1933.\n\nU.S. troops invaded Veracruz in Mexico in 1914 following the Tampico Affair. The US occupied the city for six months.\n\nThe U.S. occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934. US banks had lent money to Haiti and requested U.S. government intervention. The U.S. installed a new government in 1917 and dictated the terms of a new Haitian constitution in 1917 that instituted changes that included an end to the prior ban on land ownership by non-Haitians. The Cacos (military group) were originally armed militias of formerly enslaved persons who rebelled and took control of mountainous areas following the Haitian Revolution in 1804. Such groups fought a guerilla war against the US occupation in what were known as the \"Caco Wars.\"\n\nU.S. marines invaded the Dominican Republic and occupied the it from 1916 to 1924, and this was preceded by US military interventions in 1903, 1904, and 1914. The US Navy installed its personnel in all key positions in government and controlled the Dominican army and police. Within a couple of days, the constitutional president, Juan Isidro Jimenes, resigned.\n\nAfter the new Bolshevik government withdrew from World War I, the U.S. military together with forces of its Allies invaded Russia in 1918. Approximately 250,000 invading soldiers, including troops from Europe, the US and the Empire of Japan invaded Russia to aid the White Army against the Red Army of the new Soviet government in the Russian civil war. The invaders launched the North Russia invasion from Arkhangelsk and the Siberia invasion from Vladivostok. The invading forces included 13,000 U.S. troops whose mission after the end of World War I included the toppling of the new Soviet government and the restoration of the previous Tsarist regime. U.S. and other Western forces were unsuccessful in this aim and withdrew by 1920 but the Japanese military continued to occupy parts of Siberia until 1922 and the northern half of Sakhalin until 1925.\n\nThe United States government used its contacts in the Panama National Guard, which the U.S. had earlier trained, to orchestrate a coup against the government of Panama in October 1941. The U.S. had requested that the government of Panama allow it to build over 130 new military installations inside and outside of the Panama Canal Zone, and the government of Panama refused this request at the price suggested by the U.S. President Arnulfo Arias fled the country and Ricardo Adolfo de la Guardia Arango, the leader of the coup and a friend of the US government, became president.\n\nAs the Empire of Japan surrendered in August 1945, under the leadership of Lyuh Woon-Hyung committees throughout Korea formed to coordinate transition to Korean independence. On August 28, 1945 these committees formed the temporary national government of Korea, naming it the People's Republic of Korea (PRK) a couple of weeks later. On September 8, 1945, the United States government landed forces in Korea and thereafter established the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGK) to govern Korea south of the 38th parallel north. The USAMGK staffed the governing administration with Japanese governors and many other Japanese officials who had been part of the brutal Japanese imperial colonial government and with Koreans who had collaborated with it, which made the government unpopular and engendered popular resistance. USAMGK refused to recognize the PRK government, which had been formed to self-govern the country, and the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which had been based in China during WWII and had fought against the Japanese, and then the USAMGK by military decree outlawed the PRK government. In October 1948, USAMGK sent units to attack Koreans who were seeking Korean independence, and carried out several mass atrocities, including the killing hundreds of Korean civilians on Jeju Island who were suspected of supporting those in favor of independence.\n\nIn 1952, the Joint Chiefs of Staff directed General Mark W. Clark to formulate a plan to overthrow South Korean President Syngman Rhee, fearing that the political crisis which arose from his authoritarian conduct would imperil military objectives. Operation Everready, as the plan was named, was shelved once Rhee yielded to American pressure and released arrested opposition leaders. The plan was revived for consideration in 1953 when it was feared that Rhee would not accept the Korean Armistice Agreement.\n\nThe U.S. government provided military, logistical and other aid to the right-wing Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) army led by Chiang Kai-shek in the Chinese Civil War against Chinese Communist Party forces. The US airlifted many KMT troops from central China to Manchuria. Approximately 50,000 U.S. troops were sent to guard strategic sites in Hupeh and Shandong. The U.S. trained and equipped KMT troops, and transported Korean troops and even enemy imperial Japanese troops back to help KMT forces to occupy Chinese zones and to contain Communist-controlled areas. President Harry Truman explained that: \"It was perfectly clear to us that if we told the Japanese to lay down their arms immediately and march to the seaboard, the entire country would be taken over by the Communists. We therefore had to take the unusual step of using the enemy as a garrison until we could airlift Chinese National troops to South China and send Marines to guard the seaports.\" Within less than two years after the Sino-Japanese War, the KMT had received $4.43 billion from the United States—most of which was military aid.\n\nThe British military together with Greek forces under control of the Greek government fought for control of the country in the Greek Civil War against the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE). The DSE was composed mostly of communist partisans who as part of the Greek People's Liberation Army (ELAS) by Summer 1944 had liberated nearly all of the country from the military occupation of the Third Reich. By early 1947, the British government could no longer afford the huge cost of financing the war against DSE, and pursuant to the October 1944 Percentages Agreement between Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin, Greece was to remain part of the Western sphere of influence. Accordingly, the British requested the US government to step in and the U.S. flooded the country with military equipment, military advisers and weapons. With increased U.S. military aid, by September 1949 the Greek government eventually succeeded in winning.\n\nProject FF (the \"FF\" standing for \"Fat Fucker\") was a CIA program initially designed to modernize the Kingdom of Egypt under Farouk I. However, disillusionment with the king's ability to govern led Kermit Roosevelt Jr. to support efforts to replace the regime entirely. Upon hearing rumors of discontent within the Egyptian military, Roosevelt met with the leaders of the nationalist, anti-communist, Free Officers Movement, most notably future Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser, and informed them of American support for their imminent coup d'état. On July 23, 1952, the Free Officers Movement toppled the monarchy and established the Republic of Egypt.\n\nIn 1947, the US-backed Christian Democrats (DC), led by Alcide De Gasperi, were losing popularity, and the Communist Party of Italy (PCI) was growing particularly fast due to its organizing efforts supporting sharecroppers in Sicily, Tuscany and Umbria, movements which were also bolstered by the reforms of Fausto Gullo, the Communist minister of agriculture. The DC engineered the expulsion of all left-wing ministers from the cabinet on May 31. The PCI would not have a national position in government again for twenty years. De Gasperi did this under pressure from US Secretary of State George Marshall, who'd informed him that anti-communism was a pre-condition for receiving American aid, and Ambassador James C. Dunn who had directly asked de Gasperi to dissolve the parliament and remove the PCI.\n\nThe U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) acknowledged giving $1 million to Italian centrist parties for the 1948 election. The CIA also publishing forged letters in order to discredit the leaders of the Italian Communist Party (PCI). U.S. agencies undertook a campaign of writing ten million letters, made numerous short-wave radio broadcasts and funded the publishing of books and articles, all of which warned the Italians of what was believed to be the consequences of a communist victory. \"Time\" magazine backed the campaign for U.S. domestic audiences, featuring the Christian Democracy Party leader and Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi on its cover and in its lead story on April 19, 1948. Meanwhile the US secretly convinced the British Labour Party to pressure social democrats to end their support for PCI, and foster a devastating split in the Italian Socialist Party.\n\nCIA ultimately spent at least $65 million helping elect Italian politicians, including \"every Christian Democrat who ever won a national election in Italy.\"\n\nThe democratically elected government of Shukri al-Quwatli was overthrown by a junta led by the Syrian Army chief of staff at the time, Husni al-Za'im, who became President of Syria on April 11, 1949. The exact nature of U.S. involvement in that coup is still highly controversial. However, it is well documented that the construction of the Trans-Arabian Pipeline, which had been held up in the Syrian parliament, was approved by Za'im, the new president, just over a month after the coup.\n\nThe 1953 Iranian coup d'état, (known in Iran as the \"28 Mordad coup\") was the overthrow of the democratically elected government of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh on August 19, 1953, orchestrated by the intelligence agencies of the United Kingdom (under the name \"Operation Boot\") and the United States (under the name \"TPAJAX Project\"). The coup saw the transition of Mohammad-Rezā Shāh Pahlavi from a constitutional monarch to an authoritarian one who relied heavily on United States government support to hold on to power until his own overthrow in February 1979.\n\nIn a CIA operation code named Operation PBSUCCESS, the U.S. government executed a coup that was successful in overthrowing the democratically-elected government of President Jacobo Árbenz and installed Carlos Castillo Armas, the first of a line of brutal right-wing dictators, in its place. The perceived success of the operation made it a model for future CIA operations because the CIA lied to the president of the United States when briefing him regarding the number of casualties.\n\nThe U.S. government took over funding of the military budget of the Royal Lao Government in its civil war against the Pathet Lao communist movement, which had taken control of a part of the country. The US paid for 100% of the government's military budget and by 1957 was paying the salaries of the Royal Lao Army. Also the US set up the covert Programs Evaluation Office to field US civilian personnel with former US military experience because a treaty the US had signed expressly forbade US military advisors. By July 1959 however, the US sent in US commando units dressed as civilians to train the Royal Lao Army. These interventions did not result in regime change.\n\n\nAs a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement and host of the April 1955 Bandung Conference, Indonesia was charting a course toward an independent foreign policy that was not militarily committed to either side in the Cold War. Starting in 1957, the CIA supported a failed coup plan by rebel Indonesian military officers. CIA pilots, such as Allen Lawrence Pope, piloted planes operated by CIA front organization Civil Air Transport (CAT) that bombed civilian and military targets in Indonesia. The CIA instructed CAT pilots to target commercial shipping in order to frighten foreign merchant ships away from Indonesian waters, thereby to weaken the Indonesian economy and thus to destabilize the democratically elected government of Indonesia. The CIA aerial bombardment resulted in the sinking of several commercial ships and the bombing of a marketplace that killed many civilians. The coup attempt failed at that time and US President Eisenhower denied any US involvement.\n\nThe U.S. launched Operation Blue Bat in July 1958 to intervene in the 1958 Lebanon crisis. This was the first application of the Eisenhower Doctrine, according to which the U.S. was to intervene to protect regimes it considered threatened by international communism. The goal of the operation was to bolster the pro-Western Lebanese government of President Camille Chamoun against internal opposition and threats from Syria and Egypt.\n\nRichard Sale of \"United Press International,\" citing Adel Darwish and other experts, has reported that the October 1959 assassination attempt on Iraqi Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim involving a young Saddam Hussein and other Ba'athist conspirators was a collaboration between the CIA and Egyptian intelligence. Bryan R. Gibson has challenged the veracity of Sale and Darwish, citing declassified documents that indicate the CIA was blindsided by the timing of the assassination attempt on Qasim and that the National Security Council \"had just reaffirmed [its] nonintervention policy\" six days before it occurred. Although the assassination attempt failed after Saddam (who was only supposed to provide cover) opened fire on Qasim—forcing Saddam to spend more than three years in exile in the Egyptian-led United Arab Republic (UAR) under threat of death if he returned to Iraq—it led to widespread exposure for Saddam and the Ba'ath within Iraq, where both had previously languished in obscurity, and later became a crucial part of Saddam's public image during his tenure as President of Iraq. It is possible that Saddam visited the U.S. embassy in Cairo during his exile.\n\nOn August 9, 1960, Captain Kong Le with his paratroop battalion seized control of the administrative capital city of Vientiane in a bloodless coup on a \"Neutralist\" platform with the stated aims of ending the civil war raging in Laos, ending foreign interference in the country, ending the corruption caused by foreign aid, and better treatment for soldiers. With CIA support, Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, the prime minister of Thailand, set up a covert Thai military advisory group, called Kaw Taw. Kaw Taw together with the CIA orchestrated a November 1960 counter-coup against the new Neutralist government in Vientiane, supplying artillery, artillerymen, and advisers to General Phoumi Nosavan, first cousin of Sarit. It also deployed the CIA-sponsored Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit (PARU) to operations within Laos. With the help of CIA front organization Air America to airlift war supplies and with other U.S. military assistance and covert aid from Thailand, General Phoumi Nosavan's forces captured Vientiane in November 1960.\n\nThe CIA orchestrated a force composed of CIA-trained Cuban exiles to invade Cuba with support and equipment from the US military, in an attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel Castro. The invasion was launched in April 1961, three months after John F. Kennedy assumed the presidency in the United States. The Cuban armed forces, trained and equipped by Eastern Bloc nations, defeated the invading combatants within three days.\n\nOperation MONGOOSE was a years' long US government effort to overthrow the government of Cuba. The operation included economic warfare, including an embargo against Cuba, \"to induce failure of the Communist regime to supply Cuba's economic needs,\" a diplomatic initiative to isolate Cuba, and psychological operations \"to turn the peoples' resentment increasingly against the regime.\" The economic warfare prong of the operation also included the infiltration of CIA operatives to carry out many acts of sabotage against civilian targets, such as a railway bridge, a molasses storage facilities, an electric power plant, and the sugar harvest, notwithstanding Cuba's repeated requests to the United States government to cease its armed operations. In addition, the CIA orchestrated a number of assassination attempts against Fidel Castro, head of government of Cuba, including attempts that entailed CIA collaboration with the American mafia.\n\nWhen the president of Brazil resigned in August 1961, he was lawfully succeeded by João Belchior Marques Goulart, the democratically elected vice president of the country. João Goulart was a proponent of democratic rights, the legalization of the Communist Party, and economic and land reforms, but the US government insisted that he impose a program of economic austerity. The United States government implemented a plan with the code name Operation Brother Sam for the destabilization of Brazil, by cutting off aid to the Brazilian government, providing aid to state governors of Brazil who opposed the new president, and encouraging senior Brazilian military officers to seize power and to back army chief of staff General Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco as coup leader. General Branco led the April 1964 overthrow of the constitutional government of President João Goulart and was installed as first president of the military regime, immediately declaring a state of siege and arresting more than 50,000 political opponents within the first month of seizing power, while the US government expressed approval and re-instituted aid and investment in the country.\n\nSeveral sources, notably Said Aburish, have alleged that the February 1963 coup that resulted in the formation of a Ba'athist government in Iraq was \"masterminded\" by the CIA. However, no declassified U.S. documents have verified this allegation. Tareq Y. Ismael, Jacqueline S. Ismael, and Glenn E. Perry state that \"Ba'thist forces and army officers overthrew Qasim on February 8, 1963, in collaboration with the CIA.\" Conversely, Gibson argues that \"the preponderance of evidence substantiates the conclusion that the CIA was not behind the February 1963 B'athist coup.\" The U.S. offered material support to the new Ba'athist government after the coup, despite a bloody anti-communist purge and Iraqi atrocities against Kurdish rebels and civilians. Because of this, Nathan Citino asserts: \"Although the United States did not initiate the 14 Ramadan coup, at best it condoned and at worst it contributed to the violence that followed.\" The Ba'athist government collapsed in November 1963 over the question of unification with Syria (where a rival branch of the Ba'ath Party had seized power in March). There has been a great deal of academic discussion regarding allegations from King Hussein of Jordan and others that the CIA (or other U.S. agencies) provided the Ba'athist government with lists of communists and other leftists, who were then arrested or killed by the Ba'ath Party's militia—the National Guard. Gibson and Hanna Batatu emphasize that the identities of Iraqi Communist Party members were publicly known and that the Ba'ath would not have needed to rely on U.S. intelligence to identify them, whereas Citino considers the allegations plausible because the U.S. embassy in Iraq had actually compiled such lists, and because Iraqi National Guard members involved in the purge received training in the U.S.\n\nAlthough the United States was allied with South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, the Kennedy administration had grown increasingly frustrated with South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem's corrupt and repressive rule. In light of Diem's refusal to adopt reforms, American officials debated whether they should support efforts to replace him. These debates resulted in the dispatch of Cable 243 on August 24, 1963, which instructed United States Ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., to \"examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary\". Lodge and his liaison officer, Lucien Conein, established contact with discontented Army of the Republic of Vietnam officers and stimulated their resolve to overthrow Diem. These efforts culminated in a coup d'etat on November 2, 1963, during which Diem and his brother were assassinated.\n\nThe Pentagon Papers concluded that \"Beginning in August of 1963 we variously authorized, sanctioned and encouraged the coup efforts of the Vietnamese generals and offered full support for a successor government. In October we cut off aid to Diem in a direct rebuff, giving a green light to the generals. We maintained clandestine contact with them throughout the planning and execution of the coup and sought to review their operational plans and proposed new government.\"\n\nIn the Dominican Civil War, a junta led by President Joseph Donald Reid Cabral was battling \"constitutionalist\" or \"rebel\" forces who advocated restoring to power the Dominican Republic's first ever democratically elected president, President Juan Emilio Bosch Gaviño, whose term had been cut short by a coup. The U.S. launched \"Operation Power Pack,\" a US military operation to interpose the US military between the rebels and the junta's forces so as to prevent the rebel's advance and possibly victory. Most civilian advisers had recommended against immediate intervention hoping that the junta could bring an end to the civil war but US President Lyndon B. Johnson took the advice of his Ambassador in Santo Domingo, William Tapley Bennett, who suggested that the US intervene. Chief of Staff General Wheeler told a subordinate: \"Your unannounced mission is to prevent the Dominican Republic from going Communist.\" A fleet of 41 US vessels was sent to blockade the island as the US invaded. Ultimately, 42,000 soldiers and marines were ordered to the Dominican Republic and the US occupied the country.\n\nJunior army officers and the commander of the palace guard of President Sukarno accused senior Indonesian military brass of planning a CIA-backed coup against President Sukarno and killed six senior generals on October 1, 1965. General Muhammad Suharto and other senior military officers attacked the junior officers on the same day and accused the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) of orchestrating the killing of the six generals. The army launched a propaganda campaign based on lies and riled up civilian mobs to attack those believed to be PKI supporters and other political opponents. Indonesian government forces with collaboration of some civilians perpetrated mass killings over many months. The CIA acknowledged that \"in terms of the number of people killed, the anti-PKI massacres in Indonesia rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th Century.\" Estimates of the number of civilians killed range from a half million to a million but more recent estimates put the figure at two to three million. US Ambassador Marshall Green encouraged the military leaders to act forcefully against the political opponents. In 2017, declassified documents from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta have confirmed that the US had detailed, ongoing knowledge of the mass killings and actively facilitated and encouraged them for its own geopolitical interests. US diplomats admitted to journalist Kathy Kadane in 1990 that they had provided the Indonesian army with thousands of names of alleged PKI supporters and other alleged leftists, and that the U.S. officials then checked off from their lists those who had been murdered. President Sukarno's base of support was largely annihilated, imprisoned and the remainder terrified, and thus he was forced out of power in 1967, replaced by an authoritarian military regime led by General Suharto. Some scholars are now referring to the mass killings as a genocide.\n\nThe U.S. government supported the 1971 coup led by General Hugo Banzer that toppled President Juan José Torres of Bolivia. Torres had displeased Washington by convening an \"Asamblea del Pueblo\" (People's Assembly or Popular Assembly), in which representatives of specific proletarian sectors of society were represented (miners, unionized teachers, students, peasants), and more generally by leading the country in what was perceived as a left wing direction. Banzer hatched a bloody military uprising starting on August 18, 1971 that succeeded in taking the reigns of power by August 22, 1971. After Banzer took power, the U.S. provided extensive military and other aid to the Banzer dictatorship as Banzer cracked down on freedom of speech and dissent, tortured thousands, \"disappeared\" and murdered hundreds, and closed labor unions and the universities. Torres, who had fled Bolivia, was kidnapped and assassinated in 1976 as part of Operation Condor, the US-supported campaign of political repression and state terrorism by South American right-wing dictators.\n\nThe U.S. secretly provided millions of dollars for the Kurdish insurgency supported by Iran against the Iraqi government. The U.S. role was so secret even the US State Department and the U.S. \"40 Committee,\" created to oversee covert operations, were not informed. The troops of the Kurdish Democratic Party were led by Mustafa Barzani. Notably, unbeknownst to the Kurds, this was a covert regime change action the US wanted to fail, intended only to drain the resources of the country. The U.S. abruptly ceased support for the Kurds in 1975 and, despite Kurdish pleas for help, refused to extend even humanitarian aid to the thousands of Kurdish refugees created as a result of the collapse of the insurgency.\n\nThe democratically elected President Salvador Allende was overthrown by the Chilean armed forces and national police. This followed an extended period of social and political unrest between the right dominated Congress of Chile and Allende, as well as economic warfare waged by the U.S. government. As a prelude to the coup, the chief of staff of the Chilean army, René Schneider, a general dedicated to preserving the constitutional order, was assassinated in 1970 during a botched kidnapping attempt backed by the CIA. The regime of Augusto Pinochet that came to power with the coup is notable for having, by conservative estimates, disappeared some 3200 political dissidents, imprisoned 30,000 (many of whom were tortured), and forced some 200,000 Chileans into exile. The CIA, through Project FUBELT (also known as Track II), worked secretly to engineer the conditions for the coup. The U.S. initially denied any involvement however many relevant documents have been declassified in the decades since.\n\nIn what was known as \"Operation Cyclone,\" the U.S. government secretly provided weapons and funding for a collection of warlords and several factions of Jihadi guerillas known as the Mujahideen of Afghanistan fighting to overthrow the Afghan government and the Soviet military forces that supported it. Through the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of Pakistan, the US channeled training, weapons and money for Afghan fighters, including jihadis who later became known as the Taliban, and at an estimated cost of $800 million for as many as 35,000 Arab foreign fighters. Afghan Arabs also \"benefited indirectly from the CIA's funding, through the ISI and resistance organizations,\" Some of the CIA's greatest Afghan beneficiaries were Arabist commanders such as Jalaluddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar who were key allies of Osama Bin Laden over many years. Some of the CIA-funded militants would become part of Al Qaeda later on, and included Osama Bin Laden, according to former Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and other sources. However, these allegations are rejected by Steve Coll (\"If the CIA did have contact with bin Laden during the 1980s and subsequently covered it up, it has so far done an excellent job\"), Peter Bergen (\"The theory that bin Laden was created by the CIA is invariably advanced as an axiom with no supporting evidence\"), and Jason Burke (\"It is often said that bin Laden was funded by the CIA. This is not true, and, indeed, would have been impossible given the structure of funding that General Zia ul–Haq, who had taken power in Pakistan in 1977, had set up\"). Although Operation Cyclone officially ended in 1989 with the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, U.S. government funding for the Mujahideen continued through 1992, when the Mujahideen overran the Afghan government in Kabul.\n\nThe government of El Salvador fought a bloody civil war against the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN), an umbrella organization of leftist political opposition groups, and against leaders of agricultural cooperatives, labor leaders and others who advocated for land reform and better conditions for \"campesinos\" (tenant farmers and other agrarian laborers) that supported the FMLN. The Salvadoran army organized military death squads to terrorize the rural civil population to cease its support for the FMLN. Government forces killed more than 75,000 civilians during the war 1980–1992. The U.S. government provided military training and weapons for the Salvadoran military. The Atlacatl Battalion, a counter-insurgency battalion, was organized in 1980 at the US Army School of the Americas and had a leading role in the \"scorched earth\" military policy against the FLMN and the rural villages that supported it. Atlacatl soldiers were equipped and directed by U.S. military advisers operating in El Salvador. The Atlacatl battalion also participated in the El Mozote massacre in December 1981. By May 1983, US officers took over positions in the top levels of the Salvadoran military, were making critical decisions and running the war. A US Congressional fact finding commission found that the Salvadoran military's \"drying up the ocean\" policy of repression entailed eliminating \"entire villages from the map, to isolate the guerrillas, and deny them any rural base off which they can feed.\" The \"drying up the ocean\" or \"scorched earth\" strategy was based on tactics similar to those being employed by the junta's counter-insurgency in neighboring Guatemala and were primarily derived and adapted from U.S. strategy during the Vietnam War and taught by American military advisors.\n\nThe U.S. government attempted to topple the government of Nicaragua by secretly arming, training and funding the Contras, a millitant group based in Honduras that was created to sabotage Nicaragua and to destabilize the Nicaraguan government. As part of the training, the CIA distributed a detailed \"terror manual\" entitled \"Psychological Operations in Guerrilla War,\" which instructed the Contras, among other things, on how to blow up public buildings, to assassinate judges, to create martyrs, and to blackmail ordinary citizens. In addition to orchestrating the Contras, the U.S. government also blew up bridges and mined Corinto harbor, causing the sinking of several civilian Nicaraguan and foreign ships and many civilian deaths. After the Boland Amendment made it illegal for the U.S. government to provide funding for Contra activities, the administration of President Reagan secretly sold arms to the Iranian government to fund a secret U.S. government apparatus that continued illegally to fund the Contras, in what became known as the Iran-Contra affair. The U.S. continued to arm and train the Contras even after the Sandanista government of Nicaragua won the elections of 1984.\n\nIn what the U.S. government called Operation Urgent Fury, the U.S. military invaded the tiny island nation of Grenada to remove the Marxist government of Grenada that the Reagan Administration found objectionable. The United Nations General Assembly called the U.S. invasion \"a flagrant violation of international law\" but a similar resolution widely supported in the United Nations Security Council was vetoed by the U.S.\n\nIn December 1989, in a military operation code-named \"Operation Just Cause\", the U.S. invaded Panama. President George H. W. Bush launched the war ten years after the Torrijos–Carter Treaties were ratified to transfer control of the Panama Canal from the United States to Panama by the year 2000. The U.S. deposed \"de facto\" Panamanian leader, general, and dictator Manuel Noriega and brought him to the United States, president-elect Guillermo Endara was sworn into office, and the Panamanian Defense Force was dissolved.\n\nAfter Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, the US government strenuously lobbied governments represented on the UN Security Council to support a resolution authorizing UN members states to use \"all necessary means\" for removing Iraqi forces from Kuwait. UN Security Council Resolution 678, including such language, was passed and the US assembled a 34 state coalition force to invade. The operation was launched in January 1991 and had US code name \"Operation Desert Storm.\" The U.S.-led coalition repelled the Iraqi forces from Kuwait and returned to power the emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah.\n\n\nFollowing the Persian Gulf War in 1991, the U.S. government successfully advocated that the pre-war sanctions be made more comprehensive, which the UN Security Council did in April 1991 by adopting Resolution 687. After the UN imposed the tougher sanctions, U.S. officials stated in May 1991—when it was widely expected that the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein faced collapse—that the sanctions would not be lifted unless Saddam was ousted. In the subsequent president's administration, U.S. officials took the position that the sanctions could be lifted if Iraq complied with \"all\" of the UN resolutions it was violating, not just with UN weapons inspections. The effects of the sanctions on the Iraqi civilian population, including the child mortality rate, were disputed at the time. Whereas it was widely believed at the time that the sanctions caused a major rise in child mortality, recent research has shown that commonly cited data were fabricated by the Iraqi government and that \"there was no major rise in child mortality in Iraq after 1990 and during the period of the sanctions.\"\n\nThe CIA launched DBACHILLES, a coup d'état operation against the Iraqi government, recruiting Ayad Allawi, who headed the Iraqi National Accord, a network of Iraqis who opposed the Saddam Hussein government, as part of the operation. The network included Iraqi military and intelligence officers but was penetrated by people loyal to the Iraqi government. Also using Ayad Allawi and his network, the CIA directed a government sabotage and bombing campaign in Baghdad between 1992 and 1995, against targets that—according to the Iraqi government at the time—killed many civilians including people in a crowded movie theater. The CIA bombing campaign may have been merely a test of the operational capacity of the CIA's network of assets on the ground and not intended to be the launch of the coup strike itself. The coup was unsuccessful, but Ayad Allawi was later installed as prime minister of Iraq by the Iraq Interim Governing Council, which had been created by the U.S.-led coalition following the March 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq. As a non-covert measure, the U.S. in 1998 enacted the \"Iraq Liberation Act,\" which states, in part, that \"It should be the policy of the United States to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq,\" and appropriated funds for U.S. aid \"to the Iraqi democratic opposition organizations.\"\n\nThe Clinton administration saw an opportunity to oust Indonesian President Suharto when his rule over Indonesia became increasingly precarious in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. American officials sought to exacerbate Indonesia's monetary crisis by having the International Monetary Fund oppose Suharto's efforts to establish a currency board to stabilize the rupiah, thereby provoking discontent. IMF Director Michel Camdessus boasted that, \"We created the conditions that obliged President Suharto to leave his job\". Former US Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger would later remark, \"We were fairly clever in that we supported the IMF as it overthrew [Suharto]. Whether that was a wise way to proceed is another question. I'm not saying Mr. Suharto should have stayed, but I kind of wish he had left on terms other than because the IMF pushed him out.\" Hundreds would die in the crisis that followed.\n\nFrom the period of 1998 to 2000, just over $100,000,000 was channeled from the U.S. State Department through Quangos to opposition parties in order to bring about regime change in Yugoslavia. Following issues regarding the results of the Yugoslav elections of 2000, the U.S. State Department heavily supported opposition groups such as Otpor! through the supply of promotional material and also, consulting services via Quangos. United States involvement served to speed up and organize dissent through exposure, resources, moral and material encouragement, technological aid and professional advice. This campaign was one of the factors contributing to the Bulldozer Revolution and thus the overthrow of the long standing president Slobodan Milošević on October 5, 2000.\n\n\nAccording to U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources, beginning in 2005 the U.S. government secretly encouraged and advised a Pakistani Balochi militant group named Jundullah that is responsible for a series of deadly guerrilla raids inside Iran. Jundullah, led by Abdolmalek Rigi (sometimes written as Abd el Malik Regi), also known as \"Regi,\" was suspected of being associated with Al Qaeda, a charge that the group has denied. ABC News learned from tribal sources that money for Jundullah was routed to the group through Iranian exiles. \"They are suspected of having links to Al Qaeda and they are also thought to be tied to the drug culture,\" according to Professor Vali Nasr. U.S. intelligence sources later claimed that the orchestration of Jundallah operations was, in actuality, an Israeli Mossad (intelligence agency) false flag operation that Israeli agents disguised to make it appear to be the work of American intelligence.\n\nThe U.S. government pressured the Fatah faction of the Palestinian leadership to topple the Hamas government of Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh. The Bush Administration was displeased with the government that the majority of the Palestinian people elected in the January Palestinian legislative election of 2006. The U.S. government set up a secret training and armaments program that received tens of millions of dollars in Congressional funding, but also, like in the Iran-contra scandal, a more secret Congress-circumventing source of funding for Fatah to launch a bloody war against the Haniyeh government. The war was brutal, with many casualties and with Fatah kidnapping and torturing civilian leaders of Hamas, sometimes in front of their own families, and setting fire to a university in Gaza. When the government of Saudi Arabia attempted to negotiate a truce between the sides so as to avoid a wide-scale Palestinian civil war, the U.S. government pressured Fatah to reject the Saudi plan and to continue the effort to topple the Haniyeh government. Ultimately, the Haniyeh government was prevented from ruling over all of the Palestinian territories, with Hamas retreating to the Gaza strip and Fatah retreating to the West Bank.\n\nSince 2006, the State Department has funneled at least $6 million to the anti-government satellite channel Barada TV, associated with the exile group Movement for Justice and Development in Syria. This secret backing continued under the Obama administration, even as the US publicly rebuilt relations with Bashar Al-Assad.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, the U.S. government called on Syrian President Bashar Al Assad to \"step aside\" and imposed an oil embargo against the Syrian government to bring it to its knees. Starting in 2013, the U.S. also provided training, weapons and cash to Syrian vetted \"moderate\" rebels, and in 2014, the Supreme Military Council.\n\nIn March 2017 Ambassador Nikki Haley told a group of reporters that the US's priority in Syria was no longer on \"getting Assad out.\" Earlier that day at a news conference in Ankara, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also said that the \"longer term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people.\" While the US Defense Department's program to aid predominantly Kurdish rebels fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) will continue, it was revealed in July 2017 that US President Trump had ordered a \"phasing out\" of the CIA's support for anti-Assad rebels.\n\nThe US was part of a multi-national coalition that undertook the 2011 military intervention in Libya to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973, which was taken in response to events during the Libyan Civil War, and military operations began, with US and British naval forces firing over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles, the French and British Air Forces undertaking sorties across Libya and a naval blockade by Coalition forces.\n\nThe U.S. has been supporting the intervention by Saudi Arabia in the Yemeni Civil War. The Yemeni Civil War began in 2015 between two sides, each claiming at that time to support the legitimate government of Yemen: Houthi forces, which control the capital Sana'a and had supported former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, fighting against forces based in Aden and loyal to the government of Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. The Saudi-led offensive is aimed at restoring Hadi to power, and is allied with various local factions. The Saudi Arabian-led intervention has been widely condemned due to its widespread bombing of urban and other civilian areas, including schools and hospitals. The U.S. military provides targeting assistance and intelligence and logistical support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign, including aerial refueling. The US also provides weapons and bombs, including, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report, cluster bombs outlawed in much of the world and used by Saudi Arabia in the conflict. The US has been criticized for providing weapons and bombs knowing that Saudi bombing has been indiscriminately targeting civilians and violating the laws of war. It has been suggested that the U.S. government is legally a \"co-belligerent\" in the conflict, in which case U.S. military personnel could be prosecuted for war crimes, and a U.S. senator has accused the U.S. of complicity in Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe, with millions facing starvation. As of May 2018, the civil war is at a stalemate, and 13 million Yemeni civilians face starvation, according to the UN.\n\nDuring the modern era, Americans were involved in numerous covert regime change efforts. During the Cold War in particular, the U.S. government secretly supported military coups that overthrew democratically elected governments in Syria in 1949, Iran in 1953, Guatemala in 1954, the Congo Crisis of 1960, Brazil in 1964 and Chile in 1973.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20299758", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20299758", "title": "UpStage", "text": "UpStage\n\nUpStage is an open source server-side application that has been purpose built for Cyberformance: multiple artists collaborate in real time via the UpStage platform to create and present live theatrical performances, for audiences who can be online (from anywhere in the world) or in a shared space, and who can interact with the performance via a text chat tool. It can also be understood as a form of digital puppetry. It is the first open source platform designed specifically for avatar performances.\n\nUpStage was developed during 2003 by programmer Douglas Bagnall, to realise the vision of cyberformance troupe Avatar Body \"Collision\"; the group had been creating live performance on the internet using free chat applications such as iVisit and the Palace, and wanted to create an application that better met their artistic needs. The first version of the software was created with a grant from the Smash Palace Collaboration Fund, a joint initiative of Creative New Zealand and the NZ Ministry for Research, Science and Technology; it was launched on 9 January 2004 and began to be used by artists and students around the world, as well as by the originators, Avatar Body \"Collision\".\n\nIn 2006, the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the Auckland University of Technology began a relationship with the UpStage project, which has seen teams of final year software development students work on UpStage as a real-world software development project. This has provided invaluable ongoing maintenance and development for the software.\n\nAlso in 2006, UpStage received a second grant, this time from the Community Partnership Fund of the New Zealand government's Digital Strategy, which enabled the development of UpStage V2. Douglas Bagnall was once again the lead developer, working this time in conjunction with the AUT students. UpStage V2 was launched in June 2007, with a two-week exhibition at the New Zealand Film Archive and the first UpStage festival, 070707. The festival featured 13 performances by artists from around the world and took place over a 12-hour period on 7 July 2007. \n\nA second festival was held on 080808 (8–9 August 2008), this time covering an 18-hour period and involving artists from at least 14 time zones. It was reviewed in the Australian Stage Online. Following this, festivals were held annually on the successive monthly dates until 121212 (12 December 2012) when the festival extended over a period of one week and included cyberformance in UpStage and other online platforms. A number of works from previous festivals were restaged as a retrospective programme within the festival.\n\nAlthough \"131313\" was not possible, the tenth birthday of UpStage was celebrated 13 months after 121212, with a mini-festival of three performances and a meeting to discuss the future of UpStage. At this point, UpStage was unfunded and sustained by volunteers and the (also voluntary) work of the AUT student team. The meeting took place physically in Wellington, New Zealand, and online participants joined via UpStage. Everyone agreed that the project should continue - somehow - and also agreed that the software itself needs to be completely redeveloped, in order to take advantage of newer technologies and be more easily developed and maintained by globally dispersed open source developers.\n\nAs a web-based server-side application, UpStage can be accessed by both performers and audiences from almost any internet connected computer, using any operating system and browser; computers behind firewalls may require specific ports to be open, and the browser must have the Flash player plug-in as this is used to serve the media to the browser.\n\n\"Players\" (performers) log into UpStage and have access to a \"workshop\" or backstage area where they can upload media (graphics and audio), create \"stages\", and assign media to stages. Once on the stage, a logged-in player has access to numerous tools which allow them to manipulate the media - place, move and speak aloud with graphical avatars (using text2speech), change backdrops, play audio files, draw directly on the stage in real time, add live web cam feeds, use text chat and perform other tasks in order to create and present a performance.\n\nAudience members (also known as \"chatters\") do not log in - they simply follow a link from an email or another web page, and arrive at the stage which loads as a web page in their browser. They do not see any of the player tools, but they see and hear everything that the players are creating on the stage, and they can chat in the text chat along with the players. Audience chat appears grey and silent, while player chat is black and spoken aloud.\n\nNewcomers (both players and audience) to UpStage can learn the basics very quickly, and the fact that no additional software download is required (unless the Flash player plug-in is not already installed) makes it very accessible.

{"id": "154564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154564", "title": "Xalapa", "text": "Xalapa\n\nXalapa (often spelled Jalapa, ; ; officially Xalapa-Enríquez ) is the capital city of the Mexican state of Veracruz and the name of the surrounding municipality. In the 2005 census the city reported a population of 387,879 and the municipality of which it serves as municipal seat reported a population of 413,136. The municipality has an area of 118.45 km². Xalapa lies near the geographic center of the state and is the second-largest city in the state after the city of Veracruz to the southeast.\n\nThe name Xalapa comes from the Nahuatl roots xālli [ʃaːlːi] \"sand\" and āpan [aːpan] \"place of water\", which means approximately \"spring in the sand\". It's classically pronounced ] in Nahuatl, although the final /n/ is often omitted; the sound /ʃ/ (like the English sh) was written x in the 16th century. This doesn't occur in contemporary Spanish, and its modern counterpart (the sound [x] or [h]) is normally written as j. The spelling Xalapa (like the word México) reflects the old pronunciation. Xalapa is pronounced ], the last pronunciation is used principally in dialects of Mexico's south, the Caribbean, a large part of Central America, some places in South America and the Canary Islands and western Andalusia in Spain where [x] has converted into a voiceless glottal fricative ([h]).\n\nThe complete name of the city is Xalapa-Enriquez, bestowed in honor of governor from the 19th century, Juan de la Luz Enríquez. The city's nickname, City of Flowers (Spanish: La ciudad de las flores), was given by Alexander von Humboldt, who visited the city February 10, 1804. The reference is also related to the city's older colonial history. According to folklore, the Spanish believed that Jalapa was the birthplace and home of the world's most beautiful woman, la Florecita, which literally means \"little flower\". The residents of Xalapa are called Xalapeños or Jalapeños, which is the name given to the large popular peppers cultivated in this area.\n\nThe Totonacs first established themselves around (\"fifth mountain\" in Nahuatl). This extinct volcano received its name because the Aztecs used it as the fifth reference mountain to get to the gulf of Mexico's shores. Today it is preserved in a park. During the 14th century, four indigenous peoples settled in the territory today known as Xalapa. Each built a small village: Xalitic (in the sand) was founded by the Totonacas; Techacapan (river of waste) was founded by the Chichimecas; in the northeast Tecuanapan (river of the beasts) was founded by the Toltecas, and Tlalnecapan was founded by the Teochichimecas.\n\nAround 1313, the four villages grew together and joined, forming one large village named Xallapan. Moctezuma Ilhuicamina, the fifth Aztec emperor, invaded the territory during the second half of the 15th century. All the land was ruled as part of the Aztec Empire before the arrival and conquest of the Spanish conquistadores.\n\nIn 1519 Hernán Cortés passed through en route to Tenochtitlan. In 1555 Spanish Franciscans completed construction of a convent, an important event in the Nueva España of that time.\n\nWhen the Spanish arrived, Xalapa was barely populated. The population rose after the conquest and colonial settlement. When the Spanish improved the Mexico-Orizaba-Veracruz route, Xalapa declined in importance as a transport hub, and its population stagnated in the 17th century.\n\nFrom 1720 on Xalapa became increasingly important, due to trade with merchants from New Spain arriving to buy and sell the products of the peninsula. Numerous Spanish families from the nearby towns settled in Xalapa, so by 1760 the population had increased to over 1,000 inhabitants, including mestizo and Spanish. The growth of Xalapa in population, culture, commerce and importance, increased dramatically in the 18th century. Responding to residents' requests, Carlos IV of Spain declared Xalapa a town on 18 December 1791.\n\nIn 1772, construction of Xalapa Cathedral began. On 18 May 1784, José María Alfaro got the first air balloon in the Americas, airborne, in Xalapa. Due to the abundance of flowers growing in the region, Alexander von Humboldt, who visited the town on 10 February 1804, christened it the \"city of the flowers\".\n\nSince the beginning of the 19th century, Xalapa has been the scene of some important historical events. It supported independence from Spain. Ideas flowed freely in the town, and Xalapa was represented by many who put forward these ideas to those in Mexico City government meetings. On 20 May 1821, shortly before Mexican Independence on 27 September the same year, Xalapa was attacked by the forces of Don Antonio López de Santa Anna. Together with Don Joaquin Leño, he forced Spanish captain Juan Horbregoso to surrender the town. Independence was gained months later; the first emperor Agustín de Iturbide was not warmly received in Xalapa due to past differences.\nOn 9 May 1824, by decree of the President of the Republic Don Guadalupe Victoria, the first legislature of the state of Veracruz was established in Xalapa. That year, Xalapa was declared the state capital.\n\nIn the 1820s Xalapa and the surrounding area revolted when Vicente Guerrero replaced General Anastasio Bustamante. Veracruz was attacked by Isidro Barradas, who was attempting to reconquer parts of Mexico, and over 3,000 were deployed in the military defense of Veracruz, Córdoba and Orizaba. Anastacio Bustamante, betraying the confidence put him, unsuccessfully revolted against the legitimate government with a new plan of Xalapa, signed on 4 December 1829.\n\nOn 29 November 1830 by decree, Xalapa was named a city. In 1843, Don Antonio María de Rivera founded the Normal School of Xalapa to train teachers. Today it operates as a preparatory school for students going to college.\n\nIn 1847 in the Mexican–American War Santa Anna attempted to defeat the opposing forces near Xalapa in the Battle of Cerro Gordo. He led an army of more than 12,000 soldiers. Mexican troops suffered many casualties; around a thousand were killed and three thousand wounded on 18 April 1847. The US invaders occupied the city the following day. Among them was Lt. Ulysses S. Grant, later the commanding general of the Union armies in the American Civil War. Grant's letters call Jalapa “decidedly the most beautiful place I ever saw in my life” and its climate “the best in the world.” \n\nXalapeños such as Ambrosio Alcalde and Antonio García fought bravely to defend the city of Veracruz, but were taken prisoner. They were released and paroled, but after rejoining the fighting against the US, they were recaptured near Teocelo, taken to Xalapa, sentenced to death and executed on 24 November 1847. Today these two men are remembered as martyrs. An obelisk commemorates their sacrifice, between San Jose Church and Alcalde Market, named for Ambrosio Alcalde. US forces marched on to capture Mexico City and departed after the Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo.\n\nIn November 1862 Xalapa was attacked in the French invasion; foreigners temporarily took control of the state capital. On 27 November 1867 the corpse of emperor Maximilian I of Mexico, who had been executed in Querétaro, arrived and was held in San José, attended by the priest José María y Daza, then transferred to Veracruz the following day. The remains were shipped back to Austria for burial.\n\nIn 1885 General Juan de la Luz Enríquez increased the influence of Xalapa when he moved some legislative authority from Orizaba to Xalapa, in accordance with a decree issued in June 1884 by provisional Governor Juan Manuel Fernández de Jáuregui. Enríquez and Swiss teacher in 1886 founded the Normal School in Xalapa, the first school of this type in the country. Enríquez died in 1892, but the construction of the Normal School and founding of its other schools led to Xalapa becoming known as a center of learning, the “Athens of Veracruz”.\n\nUnder Enríquez, the old San Francisco convent was demolished, and the area developed into Parque Juárez. In June 1890 railroad construction brought the first locomotive on the Xalapa--Coatepec-Teocelo railroad to the city. The interoceanic railroad was completed in Veracruz in 1901. The public lighting system was introduced in 1904. In 1906 a clock was installed in the centre of the city on a building on Enríquez Street, which now houses the National Lottery agency.\n\nOn 18 May 1911, Francisco I. Madero visited Xalapa. On 21 June of the same year a minor conflict occurred between federal forces and revolutionaries.\n\nOn 3 January 1920, a strong earthquake rattled the city, destroying several buildings. Years later in December 1923, Xalapa fell into the power of the huertístas, commanded by Guadalupe Sánchez.\n\nIn 1940 the water building and agricultural house were constructed, today is occupied by the Agrarian League of Communities and Union Farmers of the State. On 11 September 1944 the Universidad de Veracruzana was established, and Dr. Manuel Suárez became its first director. On 4 September 1978, by decree number 325, the Local Legislature declared that the official name of Xalapa Enríquez should be written with a “X” rather than a \"J\", to emphasize its derivation from Nahuatl.\n\nXalapa is a thriving center for commerce and many multinational companies have large retail stores and franchise restaurants in the city.
