It was created by Charles R. Grosvenor Jr. (born July 7, 1972, known as Chucky G) The site was first launched March 23, 2000 and has since grown considerably.\n\nAm I Right is a community based website, with all the content contained on the website created by visitors. New material is submitted online by individuals and reviewed by a group of \"editors\" who remove entries that don't conform to community standards regarding obscene content or spam.\n\nIn 2006, a sister site called Am I Wrong was opened which allows the users to create their own quiz.\n\nSince the website's inception, the site has offered the possibility for visitors to submit misheard lyrics, aka \"mondegreens\", to the site; these are displayed along with the true lyrics. As of October 11, 2007, there are a total of 101,716 misheard lyrics. There is a section where contributors admit their more embarrassing misheard lyric mishaps and the moment they came upon their mistakes. Another section associated with misheard lyrics includes \"Misheard Lyrics in Film\", where visitors recall moments where actors or actresses recall lyrics as misquoted by actors in either film or television from famous songs.\n\nThe recordings section is for recorded performances of parodies or other musical comedy pieces. Am I Right does not host the files, so the section is essentially an index of other sites that contain recordings. All entries in this section are submitted to the site by the original authors.\n\nA recent addition to the site, the Album Cover parody section lets people humorously edit an album cover from an original artist's album, thanks to Amazon.com's Music section.\n\nThis section is focused on strange and funny facts about various songs and performers. Most pages consist of songs of performers that have certain commonalities in common such as songs that have been banned, performers that have criminal records, or songs that have backwards messages recorded in them.\n\nThis section deals with band name origins, pseudonyms, names of the offspring of famous musicians, song and band name parodies, user-created band names, inventive portmanteaux of individual band or performer names, inappropriate commercial soundtrack selections, proposed duets, inappropriate songs to play while on hold, adding, removing, or changing letters from titles to create new titles, lyrics that are literally impossible, and the use of song titles as questions and answers.\n\nThe \"real lyrics\" section contains lyrics that fit certain categories, such as those which are \"Misrhymed\", \"Insincere\", or \"Dirty\".\n\nTwo books which each gather over 500 misheard lyrics submitted to the site have been published.\n\"Hold Me Closer Tony Danza (and Other Misheard Lyrics)\" (October 28, 2007). Charles R. Grosvenor Jr, Sasquatch Books, and \"Hit Me With Your Pet Shark (and Other Misheard Lyrics)\" (October 1, 2008). Charles R.

{"id": "37496248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37496248", "title": "Automated Similarity Judgment Program", "text": "Automated Similarity Judgment Program\n\nThe Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP) is a collaborative project applying computational approaches to comparative linguistics using a database of word lists. The database is open access and consists of 40-item basic-vocabulary lists for well over half of the world's languages. It is continuously being expanded. In addition to isolates and languages of demonstrated genealogical groups, the database includes pidgins, creoles, mixed languages, and constructed languages. Words of the database are transcribed into a simplified standard orthography (ASJPcode). The database has been used to estimate dates at which language families have diverged into daughter languages by a method related to but still different from glottochronology, to determine the homeland (Urheimat) of a proto-language, to investigate sound symbolism, to evaluate different phylogenetic methods, and several other purposes.\n\nASJP was originally developed as a means for objectively evaluating the similarity of words with the same meaning from different languages, with the ultimate goal of classifying languages computationally, based on the lexical similarities observed. In the first ASJP paper two semantically identical words from compared languages were judged similar if they showed at least two identical sound segments. Similarity between the two languages was calculated as a percentage of the total number of words compared that were judged as similar. This method was applied to 100-item word lists for 250 languages from language families including Austroasiatic, Indo-European, Mayan, and Muskogean.\n\nThe ASJP Consortium, founded around 2008, came to involve around 25 professional linguists and other interested parties working as volunteer transcribers and/or extending aid to the project in other ways. The main driving force behind the founding of the consortium was Cecil H. Brown. Søren Wichmann is daily curator of the project. A third central member of the consortium is Eric W. Holman, who has created most of the software used in the project.\n\nWhile word lists used were originally based on the 100-item Swadesh list, it was statistically determined that a subset of 40 of the 100 items produced just as good if not slightly better classificatory results than the whole list. So subsequently word lists gathered contain only 40 items (or less, when attestations for some are lacking).\n\nIn papers published since 2008, ASJP has employed a similarity judgment program based on Levenshtein distance (LD). This approach was found to produce better classificatory results measured against expert opinion than the method used initially. LD is defined as the minimum number of successive changes necessary to convert one word into another, where each change is the insertion, deletion, or substitution of a symbol. Within the Levenshtein approach, differences in word length can be corrected for by dividing LD by the number of symbols of the longer of the two compared words. This produces normalized LD (LDN). An LDN divided (LDND) between the two languages is calculated by dividing the average LDN for all the word pairs involving the same meaning by the average LDN for all the word pairs involving different meanings. This second normalization is intended to correct for chance similarity.\n\nThe ASJP uses the following 40-word list. It is similar to the Swadesh–Yakhontov list, but has some differences.\n\n\n\n\n\nASJP version from 2016 uses the following symbols to encode phonemes: p b f v m w 8 t d s z c n r l S Z C j T 5 y k g x N q X h 7 L 4 G ! i e E 3 a u o\n\nThey represent 7 vowels and 34 consonants, all found on the standard QWERTY keyboard.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6799583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6799583", "title": "Cerro Palenque", "text": "Cerro Palenque\n\nCerro Palenque is an archaeological site in the department of Cortés in Honduras. The city was founded in the Late Classic (500-800 AD) but reached its peak population and grew to over 500 structures in the Terminal Classic (850-1100 AD).\n\nArchaeologists cannot determine how the people who lived at Cerro Palenque would have identified themselves since unlike the Maya of Copan and far western Honduras, they left no writing. Over the years archaeologists have tried to ascertain the identity of the people who lived on the lower Ulua river drainage at various times in terms of populations known to have existed at the time of the Spanish conquest (1536). Popular candidates include the Tol (formerly Jicaque), Lenca, and Maya. Unfortunately, archaeologists cannot currently determine if it was one of these groups, or some other unnamed group.\n\nThe site today is found on top of the hill known as Cerro Palenque (232 meters above sea level), above the town of Santiago, near the confluence of the Ulua, Humuya (Comayagua) and Blanco rivers, and on several hilltops to the north. It is located some 40 kilometers from the city of San Pedro Sula in Honduras.\n\nThe first part of the site to be settled was on the top of the hill, Cerro Palenque, and along its sides. This part was developed in the Late Classic (500 to 800 AD) and remained fairly small, but impressive. In the Terminal Classic (850-1100 AD) the city moved to the lower hill tops north of Cerro Palenque. In the Terminal Classic, this was the largest city in the lower Ulua river valley.\n\nBecause of its location where the major rivers enter the valley from the south and southwest, Cerro Palenque was in a strategic position where it could have mediated access from the interior of the country to goods produced along the coast, and coming in trade with Belize and Yucatan.\n\nThe Maya of Yucatan told the Spanish, in the 16th century, that the Ulua River valley was the land of feathers and honey. They also valued it for its chocolate (cacao). Pottery, and other kinds of artifacts, tell us that there was trade between various cities in the Ulua river valley, and the Maya of Belize and Yucatan because artifacts from these Maya centers have been found in cities in the valley at this time, and in turn, artifacts made in the valley have turned up in Maya cities in Belize and Yucatan.\n\nThe valley is formed by the Ulúa, Comayagua, and Chamelecón rivers, which provided natural transport routes into the rest of present Honduras as well as Central America. The Gulf of Honduras facilitated easy access to Yucatán and Belize. The valley was agriculturally fertile, and had access through nearby supplies or long distance exchange to luxury goods like spondylus and other marine shells, copper (in the postClassic), feathers (especially quetzal), obsidian, jade, and turquoise.\n\nThe fact that there were ruins on the top of Cerro Palenque has been known for a long time. Its first mention may be in \"A Ladies Ride across Spanish Honduras\" published in 1884.\n\nDorothy Popenoe excavated at the Late Classic portion of Cerro Palenque in the 1920s but died before she published the results of her excavations. Doris Stone included her analysis of the materials Popenoe excavated in her Archaeology of the North Coast of Honduras (1941)\n\nIn 1979, John S. Henderson began a project authorized by the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (Instituto Hondureño de Antropología e Historia - IHAH) to survey and test more than 2400 square kilometers of the valley, to record all of the archaeological sites within it, and perform a series of excavations to understand the chronology of settlement (who lived where, when). In this context, Rosemary A. Joyce did survey work and rediscovered the site. As part of her dissertation fieldwork, she mapped, and excavated at Cerro Palenque in 1982 and 1983. Her dissertation, and the book listed below are some of the results from that work. Most recently, Julia Hendon has been conducting excavations in the elite residential groups off the ballcourt.\n\nThe earliest settlement of this city, in the site called CR-44, atop Cerro Palenque itself, is Late Classic (500-850 AD). As a new city center was built to the north, this part of the site was abandoned. The new center was on top of a lower set of hills north of Cerro Palenque in the Terminal Classic (850-1100 AD). This new center includes a 300 meter long plaza and a large ball-court. There are also the remains of two causeways leading to residential groups off the main plaza. In the Terminal Classic, Cerro Palenque grew to be the largest city in the valley, with over 500 buildings. \n\nSettlement patterns shifted in the post-Classic (1150-1536) and Cerro Palenque was abandoned in favor of settlements right down along the river banks. The valley itself remains an important resource area for the Maya of Yucatan and Belize for chocolate, feathers, and honey.\n\nThe Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History (IHAH) obtained 1.09 km² of land in 1997 to create an archaeological park. The intent of the park is to develop tourism infrastructure as well as benefit rural Honduran communities around the settlement. In 2005 the IHAH contracted with an outside firm to develop a management plan for Cerro Palenque. The consultants wrote an unrealistic plan that called for a 10 year development program with a cost of more than $6,000,000. A link to that plan, in Spanish, is included in the references below (see \"Plan de Manejo\").\n\nIn 2007 the IHAH proposed a project that would develop a visitor's center and interpretive panels for Cerro Palenque, and is in the process of seeking funds to develop this park. The 2009 coup in Honduras stopped these efforts.\n\n\n"}

An instance of a person being buried with their horse (without the chariot) is called horse burial.\n\nNovokorsunskaya kurgan in the Kuban region of Russia contains a wagon grave of the Maykop culture (which also had horses). The two solid wooden wheels from this kurgan have been dated to the second half of the fourth millennium. Soon thereafter the number of such burials in this Northern Caucasus region multiplied.\n\nThree war chariot burials from around 2000 BC depicted as two wheeled open-vehicles on a fixed axle to carry one person along with three coffins, daggers, combs and antenna swords were excavated at Sinauli, Uttar Pradesh state in India.\n\nThe earliest true chariots known are from around 2,000 BC, in burials of the Sintashta-Petrovka culture in modern Russia in a cluster along the upper Tobol river, southeast of Magnitogorsk. They contained spoke-wheeled chariots drawn by teams of two horses. The culture is at least partially derived from the earlier Yamna culture, where some wagon-burials are found, and is interpreted by certain scholars to have Indo-Iranian features. The Krivoye Ozero chariot grave contained a horse skull, three pots, two bridle cheek pieces, and points of spears and arrows.\n\nLater chariot burials are found in China. The most noted of these was discovered in 1933 at Hougang, Anyang in central China's Henan Province, dating from the rule of King Wu Ding of the Yin Dynasty (c. 1,200 BC). A Western Zhou (9th century BC) chariot burial was unearthed at Zhangjiapo, Chang'an in 1955.\n\nIn Europe, chariot burials are known from Iron Age (8th century BC) Salamis, Cyprus, Tomba Regolini Galassi in Etruria (7th century BC), Italy, and from Beilngries (7th century BC), the Hallstatt C culture in Germany. Chariot burial was an Iron Age Celtic custom; while the wooden chariot has decayed, the horse harness, usually in bronze, survives well, and enough is left of the iron wheel covers and other iron parts to enable well-informed reconstructions. Only the richest were buried in this way, and there are often many other grave-goods. The 4th-century Waldalgesheim chariot burial is one of the best known. A tomb from the 4th century BC was discovered in La Gorge-Meillet, Marne in France; another (450-300) at Somme-Bionne.\n\nIn addition to the Etruscan tomb in Italy, there are two chariot burials at Sesto Calende, south of Lake Maggiore, of the Golasecca culture dating to the 7th and 6th century BC accompanied by weapons, ornaments and a large situla while an earlier burial of the same culture, at Ca' Morta - Como (c. 700 BC), included a four-wheeled wagon in the tomb.\n\nIn England, chariot burials are characteristic of, and almost confined to, the Iron Age Arras culture associated with the Parisii tribe. Finds of such burials are rare, and the persons interred were presumably chieftains or other wealthy notables. The Wetwang Slack chariot burial of c. 300 BC is unusual in that a woman was interred with the chariot. Some 21 British sites are known, spanning approximately four centuries, virtually all in the East Riding of Yorkshire. The Ferrybridge and Newbridge (near Edinburgh) chariots are unusual in Britain as they are the only ones to be buried intact. The burial custom seems to have disappeared after the Roman occupation of Britain.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37071", "title": "Civil and political rights", "text": "Civil and political rights\n\nCivil and political rights are a class of rights that protect individuals' freedom from infringement by governments, social organizations, and private individuals. They ensure one's ability to participate in the civil and political life of the society and state without discrimination or repression.\n\nCivil rights include the ensuring of peoples' physical and mental integrity, life, and safety; protection from discrimination on grounds such as race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, color, age, political affiliation, ethnicity, religion, and disability; and individual rights such as privacy and the freedoms of thought, speech, religion, press, assembly, and movement.\n\nPolitical rights include natural justice (procedural fairness) in law, such as the rights of the accused, including the right to a fair trial; due process; the right to seek redress or a legal remedy; and rights of participation in civil society and politics such as freedom of association, the right to assemble, the right to petition, the right of self-defense, and the right to vote.\n\nCivil and political rights form the original and main part of international human rights. They comprise the first portion of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (with economic, social, and cultural rights comprising the second portion). The theory of three generations of human rights considers this group of rights to be \"first-generation rights\", and the theory of negative and positive rights considers them to be generally negative rights.\n\nThe phrase \"Rights for Civil\" is a translation of Latin \"ius civis\" (rights of a citizen). Roman citizens could be either free (\"libertas\") or servile (\"servitus\"), but they all had rights in law. After the Edict of Milan in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion; however in 380, the Edict of Thessalonica required all subjects of the Roman Empire to profess Catholic Christianity. Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on Christian doctrine. According to the leaders of Kett's Rebellion (1549), \"all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious blood-shedding.\"\n\nIn the 17th century, English common law judge Sir Edward Coke revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed such rights. The Parliament of England adopted the English Bill of Rights in 1689. It was one of the influences drawn on by George Mason and James Madison when drafting the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776. The Virginia declaration is the direct ancestor and model for the U.S. Bill of Rights (1789).\n\nThe removal by legislation of a civil right constitutes a \"civil disability\". In early 19th century Britain, the phrase \"civil rights\" most commonly referred to the issue of such legal discrimination against Catholics. In the House of Commons support for civil rights was divided, with many politicians agreeing with the existing civil disabilities of Catholics. The Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 restored their civil rights.\n\nIn the 1860s, Americans adapted this usage to newly freed blacks. Congress enacted civil rights acts in 1866, 1871, 1875, 1957, 1960, 1964, 1968, and 1991.\n\nT. H. Marshall notes that civil rights were among the first to be recognized and codified, followed later by political rights and still later by social rights. In many countries, they are constitutional rights and are included in a bill of rights or similar document. They are also defined in international human rights instruments, such as the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the 1967 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nCivil and political rights need not be codified to be protected, although most democracies worldwide do have formal written guarantees of civil and political rights. Civil rights are considered to be natural rights. Thomas Jefferson wrote in his \"A Summary View of the Rights of British America\" that \"a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate.\"\n\nThe question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy. In many countries, citizens have greater protections against infringement of rights than non-citizens; at the same time, civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all persons.\n\nAccording to political scientist Salvador Santino F. Regilme Jr., analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the Global South should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors—an important perspective that has usually been systematically neglected in the social science literature.\n\nCustom also plays a role. Implied or unenumerated rights are rights that courts may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom; one example is the right to privacy in the United States, and the Ninth Amendment explicitly shows that there are other rights that are also protected.\n\nThe United States Declaration of Independence states that people have unalienable rights including \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\". It is considered by some that the sole purpose of government is the protection of life, liberty and property.\n\nIdeas of self-ownership and cognitive liberty affirm rights to choose the food one eats, the medicine one takes, the habit one indulges.\n\nCivil rights guarantee equal protection under the law. When civil and political rights are not guaranteed to all as part of equal protection of laws, or when such guarantees exist on paper but are not respected in practice, opposition, legal action and even social unrest may ensue.\n\nSome historians suggest that New Orleans was the cradle of the civil rights movement in the United States, due to the earliest efforts of Creoles to integrate the military \"en masse\". W.C.C. Claiborne, appointed by Thomas Jefferson to be governor of the Territory of Orleans, formally accepted delivery of the French colony on December 20, 1803. Free men of colour had been members of the militia for decades under both Spanish and French control of the colony of Louisiana. They volunteered their services and pledged their loyalty to Claiborne and to their newly adopted country.\n\nDespite this, in early 1804, the new U.S. administration in New Orleans, under Governor Claiborne, was faced with a dilemma previously unknown in the United States, i.e., the integration of the military by incorporating entire units of previously established \"colored\" militia. See, e.g., the February 20, 1804 letter to Claiborne from Secretary of War Henry Dearborn that \"it would be prudent not to increase the Corps, but to diminish, if it could be done without giving offense\".\n\nCivil rights movements in the United States gathered steam by 1848 with such documents as the Declaration of Sentiment. Consciously modeled after the Declaration of Independence, the Declaration of Rights and Sentiments became the founding document of the American women's movement, and it was adopted at the Seneca Falls Convention, July 19 and 20, 1848.\n\nWorldwide, several political movements for equality before the law occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980. These movements had a legal and constitutional aspect, and resulted in much law-making at both national and international levels. They also had an activist side, particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread. Movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included:\n\n\nMost civil rights movements relied on the technique of civil resistance, using nonviolent methods to achieve their aims. In some countries, struggles for civil rights were accompanied, or followed, by civil unrest and even armed rebellion. While civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights, the process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.\n\nQuestions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged. For example, to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other individuals, or from corporations—e.g., in what way should employment discrimination in the private sector be dealt with?\n\nPolitical theory deals with civil and political rights. Robert Nozick and John Rawls expressed competing visions in Nozick's \"Anarchy, State, and Utopia\" and Rawls' \"A Theory of Justice\". Other influential authors in the area include Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, and Jean Edward Smith.\n\nFirst-generation rights, often called \"purple\" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature, as well as strongly individualistic: They serve negatively to protect the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, (in some countries) the right to keep and bear arms, freedom of religion and voting rights. They were pioneered in the United States by the Bill of Rights and in France by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in the 18th century, although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the Magna Carta of 1215 and the Rights of Englishmen, which were expressed in the English Bill of Rights in 1689.\n\nThey were enshrined at the global level and given status in international law first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and later in the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In Europe, they were enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights in 1953.\n\nThe civil rights movement was a struggle for social justice that took place mainly during the 1950s and 1960s for blacks to gain equal rights under the law in the United States. In 1868, the 14th amendment to the constitution gave blacks equal protection under the law.\nIn the 1960s, Americans who knew only the potential of \"equal protection of the laws\" expected the president, the Congress, and the courts to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr.\n\n"}

The Templars were accused of Satanic practices, perversions and blasphemy and ruthlessly suppressed; Its leaders were burned on March 18, 1314. The circumstances of their suppression gave rise to legends surrounding the Knights Templar. In Germany, \"where the growth of deviant Masonic rites was greatest,\" the Templar heritage was adopted for irregular Freemasonry. (Freemasonry had been officially founded in England in 1717.)\n\nThe idea of chivalric Freemasonry first occurred ca. 1737 in France. In 1775 Baron Gotthelf von Hund (1722–76) founded the Order of Strict Observance, claiming the possession of secret Templar documents which allegedly prove that his order represented the legal Templar succession.\n\nIn the 17th century and 18th century, Rosicrucian ideas flourished in varying degrees. Rosicrucianism goes back to the beginning of the 17th century, when three works by Johann Valentin Andreae were printed at Kassel. One of these works, the \"Chymische Hochzeit\", appears to be an alchemical tract, while the other two (for which the authorship of Valentin Andreae is not finally proven) announce the existence of the \"Rosicrucian Order\", which desires an \"universal and general reformation of the whole world\". Putatively this order was founded by Christian Rosenkreutz, who is supposed to have lived from 1378 to 1484.\n\nIn either 1747 or 1757 a quasi-masonic Rosicrucian order of the name \"Gold- und Rosenkreuz\" was founded in Berlin, having a 9-grade hierarchy based on the cabalistic Tree of Life; This organisation included King Frederick William II of Prussia and Johann Christoph von Wöllner as members.\n\nThe first German Theosophical Society was established in July 1884, under the presidency of Wilhelm Hübbe-Schleiden, a conservative German nationalist turned spiritual seeker who sought to establish Theosophy on a \"scientific\" basis. Between 1886 and 1895 Hübbe-Schleiden published the monthly periodical \"Die Sphinx\". In Vienna, a theosophical society was founded in 1887, its president was Friedrich Eckstein. Among his circle at this time Franz Hartmann, a leader of theosophical work who emphasized personal spiritual experience, and the young Rudolf Steiner were members. A \"German Theosophical Society\", as a branch of the \"International Theosophical Brotherhood\", then was established in 1896 when the American theosophists around William Quan Judge, Katherine Tingley, \"E. T. Hargrove\" and \"C. F. Wright\" travelled through Europe. Its president was Franz Hartmann, who also founded a theosophical lay-monastery at Ascona in 1889. His periodical Lotusblüten (\"Lotus Blossoms\", 1892–1900) was the first German publication to use the theosophical swastika on its cover.\n\nHartmann's example provided the impetus for Paul Zillmann to found the \"Metaphysische Rundschau\" (\"Metaphysical Review\") in 1896.\n\nRudolf Steiner was made general secretary of the \"German Theosophical Society\" in 1902. Steiner, who was seeking to develop an esoteric path suitable for the modern era, and professed commitment to scientific methodology, was yet oriented towards awakening spiritual experiences in each individual rather than depending upon authorities or gurus. He published \"Luzifer\" at Berlin from 1903 to 1908.\n\nIn Vienna, there also existed an \"Association for Occultism\", connected to a person called \"Philipp Maschlufsky\". From 1903 he published a periodical called \"Die Gnosis\", that was later absorbed by \"Rudolf Steiner's\" periodical \"Luzifer\", and renamed \"Lucifer-Gnosis\".\n\n\"It may have been a desire to counter Steiner's influence in the occult subculture which led Hartmann to encourage the publication of several new periodicals.\" A Theosophical Publishing House was established by \"Hugo Vollrath\" in Leipzig in 1906. Among the magazines published there was \"Prana\" (1909–19), initially edited by \"Karl Brandler-Pracht\" and later edited by Johannes Balzli. Before that, a publisher with the name Wilhelm Friedrich had already published the works of Hartmann and Hübbe-Schleiden, as well as translations of the English theosophists at Leipzig. Wilhelm Friedrich had also published the occult works of Max Ferdinand Sebaldt von Werth (1859–1916). Initially, this author had collaborated with Moritz von Egidy on the periodical \"Das angewande Christentum\" (\"Applied Christianity\"), but later he wrote volumes on \"the sexual-religion of the Aryans\", thus, in the opinion of Goodrick-Clarke, anticipating Ariososophy.\n\nFrom 1907 (at latest), tensions between Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society grew steadily. In 1912, Rudolf Steiner broke away to found anthroposophy. There were two causes of the break; Steiner's European and Christian orientation had long been distinct from the hinduistic interest of the theosophists under the leadership of Annie Besant. More immediately, Steiner publicly distanced himself from Besant's promotion of Jiddu Krishnamurti as a supposed new messiah. Steiner and a group of prominent German theosophists officially founded the Anthroposophical Society in December 1913, the vast majority of the German membership of the Theosophical Society following them into the new group; the breakaways were excluded from the Theosophical Society in January 1914.\n\nLiving in Vienna, Guido (von) List (1848–1919) had been active as journalist and writer. After he turned to esotericism, he became the first popular author to combine völkisch ideology and occultism into the type of esoteric doctrine that is now collectively labelled Ariosophy. In September 1903 the occult periodical \"Die Gnosis\" (see above) included an article by List, in which he, referring Sebaldt von Werth, started to articulate \"a Germanic occult religion\". In the following decade, List continued to work on this topic, also making references to the works of Madame Blavatsky and William Scott-Elliot. In his concept of Armanism, the religion of the theocratic elite in his image of the ancient Germanic past, List borrowed material from Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism. Since his manuscript, proposing the research into the runes by the \"means of occult insight\", was rejected from the Imperial Academie of Sciences in Vienna, the supporters of List formed a List Society (\"Guido-von-List-Gesellschaft\") to finance his research. The Society was founded officially on 2 March 1908. Its members included völkisch authors as well as occultists (for example Franz Hartmann and the complete membership of the Vienna Theosophical Society). Some inner members of the List Society participated in the activities of the \"Hoher Armanen-Orden\" (\"High Armanen-Order\"). This order, however, achieved no significance as a lodge-like organisation.\n\nJörg Lanz (von Liebenfels) (1874–1954) had been a cistercian monk between 1893 and 1899. In 1903 he published a long article \"Anthropozoon biblicum\" in the \"Vierteljahrsschrift für Bibelkunde\", a periodical for biblical research. By 1905 his studies in this direction had cumulated into the book \"Theozoologie\", a \"strange amalgam\" of traditional Judaeo-Christian sources and contemporary life-sciences. Among other things, Lanz proposed a \"frequently obscene and always radical\" interpretation of the Bible, according to which it had been the purpose of the Old Testament to warn the Aryan race against interbreeding with Pygmies. In 1905 Lanz also established his own magazine, Ostara. One of the few other contributors to this magazine beside Lanz himself was the theosophist Harald Grävell von Jostenoode (1856–1932), who also edited one number of Lotusblüten.\n\nAmong the theosophists, astrology enjoyed a revival. Astrological texts by Karl Brandler-Pracht, Otto Pöllner, Ernst Tiede, and Albert Knief appeared at the Theosophical Publishing House at Leipzig. \"Karl Brandler-Pracht\" had also founded the \"First Viennese Astrological Society\" in 1907. Erik Jan Hanussen, who later would become the most famous clairvoyant in Germany and Austria, gave his first occult session with \"E. K. Hermann\" in Vienna in 1911.\n\nThe German and Vienna occult subculture was well developed before the First World War. Aside from the developments mentioned above, there are some more of interest:\n\n\"The Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO) originated in the irregular masonic activities of Theodor Reuss, Franz Hartmann, and Karl Kellner between 1895 and 1906.\" Theodor Reuss had been in contact with William Wescott, a founding member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.\n\nErnst Wachler was a völkisch author (he supported the \"Guido von List Society\") who had founded an open-air Germanic theatre in the Harz mountains. This theatre, called \"Green Stage\" (\"Grüne Bühne\"), was closed in 1937.\n\nThe Germanische Glaubens-Gemeinschaft, founded in 1907, is claimed by current Germanic Neopaganism groups as predecessor. It was founded and led by the painter Ludwig Fahrenkrog. Since 1908, the group used the swastika as its symbol. After 1938 the use of the swastika became prohibited and the group was no longer allowed to hold public meetings. However, unlike many other esoteric groups in Nazi Germany, the GGG was not forced to disband, partly \"because of Fahrenkrog's international status as an artist.\"\n\nLanz had coined the term ariosophy, meaning occult wisdom concerning the Aryans, in 1915. In the 1920s he then used this label for his doctrine. Both List and Lanz greeted World War I as a millenarian struggle. Guido von List wrote his research reports on the \"Aryo-Germanics\" (Ario-Germanen) between 1908 and 1913, but in 1917 two later articles written by him appeared in \"Prana\". He died 1919 in Berlin. The List Society was continued after his death, but not much is known of its activities.\nBy contrast, an organisation founded around 1907 by Lanz von Liebenfels achieved more significance: the \"new Templar lodge\", called \"Ordo Novi Templi\" (ONT) (German: ).\n\nOn 11 November 1932, influenced by Ariosophy, an industrialist with the name Johann Walthari Wölfl also founded an association called the Lumenclub in Vienna, which overlapped in membership with the ONT. The ideological sympathy of the Lumenclub to Nazism is beyond question, as it acted as growth centre for the Nazi party that was illegal in Austria since 1934. Nevertheless, they were later suppressed like other esoteric groups. After the \"Anschluss\" in 1938, Lanz von Liebenfels had his writings banned. The Lumenclub and the ONT were suppressed by the Gestapo in March 1942, following the party edict of December 1938 that applied to many sectarian groups.\n\n\"Werner von Bülow\" and \"Herbert Reichstein\" had applauded the advent of the third reich in their esoteric magazines.\n\nInfluenced by Guido von List and Lanz von Liebenfels (see: Ariosophy), a new \"Aryan occultist movement\" was started after 1918 in Germany by Rudolf John Gorsleben.\n\nSince the esoteric importance of the runes (that first had been developed by Guido von List, see Armanen runes) was central to his world-view, Goodrick-Clarke speaks in this context of \"rune occultism\".\n\nHere two authors stand out, as they engaged the runes in \"a less explicitly Aryan racist context\". Friedrich Bernhard Marby and Siegfried Adolf Kummer focused more on the practical side of rune occultism. In 1936 Friedrich Bernhard Marby was arrested and sent to a concentration camp (\"Flossenbürg\" and later Dachau). He survived and resumed his occult research after the war. Responsible for his incarceration might have been Karl Maria Wiligut, who was Himmler's counsellor on the occult. (see: Nazi occultism) Willigut was of the opinion that Marby (and also Kummer) were bringing \"the holy Aryan heritage into disrepute and ridicule\". Wiligut also had identified Irminism as the true ancestral religion, claiming that Guido von List's \"Wotanism\" and runic row was a schismatic false religion, but this does seem to be unconnected to the arrest of Marby.\n\nOther measures against esoteric groups were most probably the result of the general Nazi policy of suppressing lodge organizations.\n\nIn the years following the military defeat, there was a burgeoning occult movement in Germany and Austria. Significant figures in this milieu were Gustav Meyring, Franz Spunda and Peryt Shou.\n\nThe German Faith Movement led by Jakob Wilhelm Hauer during 1933-1945 propagated a move away from Christianity towards an \"Aryan-Nordic religion\", partly inspired by Hinduism.\n\nThe suppression of Freemasonry in Nazi Germany also reached the level of outright persecution. It is estimated that between 80,000 and 200,000 Freemasons were murdered under the Nazi regime. The lodge Liberté chérie was founded in a concentration camp. Freemasons, who were sent to concentration camps, were sent there as political prisoners, and consequently forced to wear an inverted red triangle. (see: Nazi concentration camp badges)\n\nWithin the Nazi ideology it was alleged that Freemasonry was part of \"the Jewish conspiracy\". Since many esoteric groups emulated the lodge structure of Freemasonry, they were \"caught in the National Socialist anti-Masonic law of 1935\". Even \"the German Order of Druids\" was closed down, \"protesting to the last that they were not Freemasons but good, German Druids.\" In her biography of Richard Walther Darré, the historian Anna Bramwell also remarks that a secret society called the Skald Order \"was banned by the Nazis after 1933 because of its allegedly masonic nature.\" Several members of the Skald held office in the Third Reich, including Dr Ludolf Haase (a founder member of the Skald), Herbert Backe and Theo Gross; all came under covert investigation, though Backe is said to have been cleared of disloyalty by Heydrich from his deathbed.\n\nWhether the Nazi ideology had a special view concerning the various esoteric doctrines (aside from confusing them with Freemasonry) is not clear. Concerning Anthroposophy, a book whose title denounced Rudolf Steiner as a fraud (\"Schwindler\") and a false prophet had been published by Gregor Schwartz-Bostunitsch in 1930. Schwartz-Bostunitsch had been an \"enthusiastic Anthroposophist\" from 1923, but was disaffected by 1929 and later joined the SS.\n\nAstrology was officially interdicted in Nazi Germany after 1938. However, the Nazis had sympathizing astrologers write favourable interpretations of Nostradamus for psychological warfare, and as late as 1936 Hitler personally sent a greetings telegram to an international astrologer's congress that was taking place in Düsseldorf.\n\nThe full focus of the state was not aimed at religious groups until 9 June 1941 when Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the security police, banned lodge organizations and esoteric groups in the wake of the flight to Scotland by Rudolf Hess, who had been attracted and influenced by the organic farming theories of Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy. However, the suppression of esoteric organisations began very soon after the Nazis acquired governmental power. Dr. Anna Bramwell points out that \"occultist racialists were banned as early as 1934.\"\n\nAllegedly the stage magician and occultist Franz Bardon had attracted the notice of Adolf Hitler \"like other workers for the Light\" and was incarcerated in a concentration camp for three and a half months in 1945.\n\nThe Thule Society was dissolved still in the 1920s, well before Hitler's rise to power, and the anti-Masonic legislation of 1935 closed down esoteric organisations including \"völkisch\" occultist ones.\n\nKarl Maria Wiligut, the chief occultist influence on the Nazi establishment, retired in 1939. Alfred Rosenberg, whose 1930 \"Myth of the Twentieth Century\" had been important in the foundation of Nazi racist ideology, and Heinrich Himmler, who added a number of occultist \"design elements\" to the Schutzstaffel, did remain high ranking party members throughout the war. Himmler's mystic tendencies can be seen in the Ahnenerbe organization and the Wewelsburg castle.\n\nAccording to their private writings, the leaders of the Nazi Party in Germany did not wish to encourage forms of paganism which did not serve to further their goals of promoting pan-Germanic ethnic consciousness.\n\nAlready in 1927, Hitler had fired the Gauleiter of Thüringen, Artur Dinter, from his post because he wanted too much to make a religion of Aryan racial purity. In 1928, Dinter was expelled from the party when he publicly attacked Hitler about this decision.\n\nRudolf von Sebottendorff had been involved in the Thule Society. In January 1933 he published \"Bevor Hitler kam: Urkundlich aus der Frühzeit der Nationalsozialistischen Bewegung\" (Before Hitler Came: Documents from the Early Days of the National Socialist Movement). Nazi authorities disliked the book, which was banned in the following year. Sebottendorff was arrested but managed to flee to Turkey.\n\n\nOther than popular Western astrology, there is also a school of thought regarding Germanic Runic Astrology and its usage in divination within the northern tradition of Odinism.\n\nThe work of Friedrich Bernhard Marby was continued by Rudolf Arnold Spieth, who also published one of his works posthumously.\n\nA revival of Neopaganism in Germany and Austria began in the 1970s.\nSince the 1980s, mainstream esotericism in German-speaking Europe has been dominated by generic New Age syncretism as it developed in the United States.\n\n\n"}

They violate, in a variety of ways, standard novelistic expectations by drastic—and sometimes highly successful—experiments with subject matter, form, style, temporal sequence, and fusions of the everyday, fantastic, mythical, and nightmarish, in renderings that blur traditional distinctions between what is serious or trivial, horrible or ludicrous, tragic or comic.

{"id": "14298096", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14298096", "title": "Jain philosophy", "text": "Jain philosophy\n\nJain philosophy is the oldest Indian philosophy that separates body (matter) from the soul (consciousness) completely. Jain philosophy deals with reality, cosmology, epistemology (study of knowledge) and Vitalism. It attempts to explain the rationale of being and existence, the nature of the Universe and its constituents, the nature of soul's bondage with body and the means to achieve liberation.\n\nJain texts expound that in every half-cycle of time, twenty-four tirthankaras grace this part of the Universe to teach the unchanging doctrine of right faith, right knowledge and right conduct. Jain philosophy means the teachings of a \"Tirthankara\" which are recorded in Sacred Jain texts. The distinguishing features of Jain philosophy are:-\n\nJainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions; and that self-reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation.\n\nAccording to the Jain texts, the vitalities or life-principles are ten, namely the five senses, energy, respiration, life-duration, the organ of speech, and the mind. The table below summaries the vitalities, living beings possess in accordance to their senses.\n\nIn the animal world, the five-sensed beings without mind have nine life-principles with the addition of the sense of hearing. Those endowed with mind have ten with the addition of the mind. According to Tattvarthasutra, a major Jain text, \"the severance of vitalities out of passion is injury\". According to the Purushartha Siddhyupaya, \"non-manifestation of passions like attachment is non-injury , and manifestation of such passions is injury (hiṃsā).\" This is termed as the essence of the Jaina Scriptures. Vegetarianism and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahiṃsā.\n\nJain philosophy postulates that seven \"tattva\" (truths or fundamental principles) constitute reality. These are:-\n\nThe knowledge of these reals is said to be essential for the liberation of the soul.\n\nAccording to the Jain philosophy, the world (\"Saṃsāra\") is full of \"hiṃsā\" (violence). Therefore, one should direct all his efforts in attainment of \"moksha\". According to the Jain text, Tattvartha sutra:\n\nJain text mention about the following stages of spiritual development:\nThose who pass the last stage are called \"siddha\" and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.\n\nAccording to Jainas, the world is composed of two different kinds of substances, the \"Jīva\" (conscious) and the \"ajīva\" (unconscious). These are the uncreated existing constituents of the Universe which impart the necessary dynamics to the Universe by interacting with each other. These constituents behave according to the natural laws and their nature without interference from external entities. Dharma or true religion according to Jainism is \"Vatthu sahāvō dhammō\" translated as \"the intrinsic nature of a substance is its true dharma.\"\n\nThe five unconscious (\"ajīva\") substances are:\n\n\nAccording to the Jain philosophy, there are infinite independent souls. These are categorised into two—liberated and non-liberated. Infinite knowledge, perception and bliss are the intrinsic qualities of a soul. These qualities are fully enjoyed unhindered by liberated souls, but obscured by \"karma\" in the case of non-liberated souls resulting in karmic bondage. This bondage further results in a continuous co-habitation of the soul with the body. Thus, an embodied non-liberated soul is found in four realms of existence—heavens, hells, humans and animal world – in a never-ending cycle of births and deaths also known as \"samsāra\". The soul is in bondage since beginningless time; however, it is possible to achieve liberation through rational perception, rational knowledge and rational conduct. Harry Oldmeadow notes that Jain ontology is both realist and dualist metaphysics.\n\nIn Jainism, karma is the basic principle within an overarching psycho-cosmology. It not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of as a kind of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.\n\nJains cite inequalities, sufferings, and pain as evidence for the existence of karma. Jain texts have classified the various types of karma according to their effects on the potency of the soul. The Jain theory seeks to explain the karmic process by specifying the various causes of karmic influx (āsrava) and bondage (bandha), placing equal emphasis on deeds themselves, and the intentions behind those deeds. The Jain karmic theory attaches great responsibility to individual actions, and eliminates reliance on supposed existence of divine grace or retribution. The Jain doctrine also holds that it is possible for us to both modify our karma, and to obtain release from it, through the austerities and purity of conduct.\n\nJain cosmology denies the existence of a supreme being responsible for creation and operation of universe. According to Jainism, this \"loka\" or Universe is an uncreated entity, existing since infinity, immutable in nature, beginningless and endless. describe the shape of the Universe as similar to a man standing with legs apart and arm resting on his waist. The Universe according to Jainism is narrow at top and broad at middle and once again becomes narrow at the bottom. of Ācārya Jinasena is famous for his quote:\n\nAccording to Jainism, time is beginningless and eternal. The Kālacakra, the cosmic wheel of time, rotates ceaselessly. The wheel of time is divided into two half-rotations, Utsarpiṇī or ascending time cycle and Avasarpiṇī, the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other. Utsarpiṇī is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness, while Avsarpiṇī is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality. Each of this half time cycle consisting of innumerable period of time (measured in Sagaropama and Palyopama years) is further sub-divided into six \"aras\" or epochs of unequal periods. Currently, the time cycle is in \"avasarpiṇī\" or descending phase with the following epochs.\nThe aras defined in Jain texts are:\nIn \"utsarpiṇī\" the order of the aras is reversed. Starting from Duḥṣama- duḥṣamā, it ends with Suṣama-suṣamā and thus this never ending cycle continues. Each of these aras progress into the next phase seamlessly without apocalyptic consequences. The increase or decrease in the happiness, life spans and length of people and general moral conduct of the society changes in a phased and graded manner as the time passes. No divine or supernatural beings are credited or responsible with these spontaneous temporal changes, either in a creative or overseeing role, rather human beings and creatures are born under the impulse of their own karma.\n\nThe early Jains contemplated the nature of the earth and universe and developed a detailed hypothesis on the various aspects of astronomy and cosmology. According to the Jain texts, the universe is divided into 3 parts:\n\nDuring the each motion of the half-cycle of the wheel of time, 63 Śalākāpuruṣa or 63 illustrious men, consisting of the 24 Tīrthaṅkaras and their contemporaries regularly appear. The Jain universal or legendary history is basically a compilation of the deeds of these illustrious men. They are 24 Tīrthaṅkara, 12 Chakravartī, 9 Baladevas, 9 Vāsudevas and 9 Prativāsudevas.\nBesides these there are 9 Narada, 11 Rudras, 24 Kamdeva, 24 Fathers of the Tirthankaras, 24 Mothers of the Tirthankaras and 14 patriarchs (\"Kulakara\") who are also important figures in Jain universal history.\n\nJainism made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of philosophy by occupying itself with the basic epistemological issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable. Knowledge for the Jains takes place in the soul, which, without the limiting factor of karma, is omniscient. Humans have partial knowledge – the object of knowledge is known partially and the means of knowledge do not operate to their full capacity. According to \"Tattvārthasūtra\", the knowledge of the basic Jaina truths can be obtained through:\nOne of the most important and fundamental doctrines of Jainism is Anēkāntavāda. It refers to the principles of pluralism and multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.\n\nJains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with \"andhagajanyāyah\", which can be illustrated through the parable of the \"blind men and an elephant\". In this story, each blind man felt a different part of an elephant (trunk, leg, ear, etc.). All the men claimed to understand and explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed, due to their limited perspectives. This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the \"Kevalis\"—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge. According to the doctrine, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent absolute truth.\n\n\"Anekāntavāda\" encourages its adherents to consider the views and beliefs of their rivals and opposing parties. Proponents of \"anekāntavāda\" apply this principle to religion and philosophy, reminding themselves that any religion or philosophy—even Jainism—which clings too dogmatically to its own tenets, is committing an error based on its limited point of view. The principle of \"anekāntavāda\" also influenced Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to adopt principles of religious tolerance, and \"satyagraha\".\n\n\"Syādvāda\" is the theory of conditioned predication, which provides an expression to \"anekānta\" by recommending that the epithet \"Syād\" be prefixed to every phrase or expression. \"Syādvāda\" is not only an extension of \"anekānta\" ontology, but a separate system of logic capable of standing on its own. The Sanskrit etymological root of the term \"syād\" is \"perhaps\" or \"maybe\", but in the context of \"syādvāda\", it means \"in some ways\" or \"from a perspective\". As reality is complex, no single proposition can express the nature of reality fully. Thus the term \"syāt\" should be prefixed before each proposition giving it a conditional point of view and thus removing any dogmatism in the statement. Since it ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, \"syādvāda\" is known as \"saptibhaṅgīnāya\" or the theory of seven conditioned predications. These seven propositions, also known as \"saptibhaṅgī\", are:\n\nEach of these seven propositions examines the complex and multifaceted nature of reality from a relative point of view of time, space, substance and mode. To ignore the complexity of reality is to commit the fallacy of dogmatism.\n\n\"Nayavāda\" is the theory of partial standpoints or viewpoints. \"Nayavāda\" is a compound of two Sanskrit words—\"naya\" (\"partial viewpoint\") and \"vāda\" (\"school of thought or debate\"). It is used to arrive at a certain inference from a point of view. An object has infinite aspects to it, but when we describe an object in practice, we speak of only relevant aspects and ignore irrelevant ones. This does not deny the other attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; they are just irrelevant from a particular perspective. As a type of critical philosophy, \"nayavāda\" holds that all philosophical disputes arise out of confusion of standpoints, and the standpoints we adopt are, although we may not realise it, \"the outcome of purposes that we may pursue\". While operating within the limits of language and seeing the complex nature of reality, Māhavīra used the language of \"nayas\". \"Naya\", being a partial expression of truth, enables us to comprehend reality part by part.\n\nThe Jain morality and ethics are rooted in its metaphysics and its utility towards the soteriological objective of liberation. Jaina ethics evolved out of the rules for the ascetics which are encapsulated in the \"mahavratas\" or the five great vows.\n\nThese ethics are governed not only through the instrumentality of physical actions, but also through verbal action and thoughts. Thus, ahimsa has to be observed through mind, speech, and body. The other rules of the ascetics and laity are derived from these five major vows.\n\nJainism does not invoke fear of or reverence for God or conformity to the divine character as a reason for moral behaviour, and observance of the moral code is not necessary simply because it is God's will. Neither is its observance necessary simply because it is altruistic or humanistic, conducive to general welfare of the state or the community. Rather it is an egoistic imperative aimed at self-liberation. While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by \"Arihants\" who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but because the life of the Arihants has demonstrated that such commandments were conducive to the Arihant's own welfare, helping them to reach spiritual victory. Just as the Arihants achieved or liberation by observing the moral code, so can anyone, who follows this path.\n\nThe most elaborate and well-preserved Indian theory of atomism comes from the philosophy of the Jaina school, dating back to at least the 6th century BC. Some of the Jain texts that refer to matter and atoms are Pancastikayasara, Kalpasutra, Tattvarthasutra and Pannavana Suttam. The Jains envisioned the world as consisting wholly of atoms, except for souls. Paramāņus or atoms were the basic building blocks of matter. Their concept of atoms was very similar to classical atomism, differing primarily in the specific properties of atoms. Each atom, according to Jain philosophy, has one kind of taste, one smell, one color, and two kinds of touch, though it is unclear what was meant by \"kind of touch\". Atoms can exist in one of two states: subtle, in which case they can fit in infinitesimally small spaces, and gross, in which case they have extension and occupy a finite space. Certain characteristics of Paramāņu correspond with that of sub-atomic particles. For example, Paramāņu is characterized by continuous motion either in a straight line or in case of attractions from other Paramāņus, it follows a curved path. This corresponds with the description of orbit of electrons across the Nucleus. Ultimate particles are also described as particles with positive (Snigdha i.e. smooth charge) and negative (Rūksa – rough) charges that provide them the binding force. Although atoms are made of the same basic substance, they can combine based on their eternal properties to produce any of six \"aggregates\", which seem to correspond with the Greek concept of \"elements\": earth, water, shadow, sense objects, karmic matter, and unfit matter. To the Jains, karma was real, but was a naturalistic, mechanistic phenomenon caused by buildups of subtle karmic matter within the soul. They also had detailed theories of how atoms could combine, react, vibrate, move, and perform other actions, which were thoroughly deterministic.\n\nJainism had a major influence in developing a system of philosophy and ethics that had a major impact on Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. The scholarly research and evidences have shown that philosophical concepts that are typically Indian – Karma, Ahimsa, Moksa, reincarnation and like – either have their origins in the shramana traditions or were propagated and developed by Jain teachers. The sramanic ideal of mendicancy and renunciation, that the worldly life was full of suffering and that emancipation required giving up of desires and withdrawal into a lonely and contemplative life, was in stark contrast with the brahmanical ideal of an active and ritually punctuated life based on sacrifices, household duties and chants to deities. Sramanas developed and laid emphasis on Ahimsa, Karma, moksa and renunciation.\n\nJain philosophy arose from the shramana traditions. In its 2500 years post-Mahavira history, it remained fundamentally the same as preached by Mahavira, who preached essentially the same religion as the previous Tirthankara. Harry Oldmeadow notes that the Jain philosophy remained fairly standard throughout history and the later elaborations only sought to further elucidate preexisting doctrine and avoided changing the ontological status of the components. The schisms into Śvetāmbara and Digambara traditions arose mainly on account of differences in question of practice of nudity amongst monks and liberation of women. Apart from these minor differences in practices, there are no major philosophical differences between the different sects of Jainism. The Tattvārthasūtra, which encapsulates major philosophical doctrines, is accepted by all traditions of Jainism. This coherence in philosophical doctrine and consistency across different schools has led scholars like Jaini to remark that in the course of history of Jainism no heretical movements like Mahayana, tantric or bhakti movement developed outside mainstream Jainism. Thus, there are traditions within Jainism, but basically the same philosophy that is at the core of Jainism.\n\nAs per the tradition, Jain Sangh was divided into two major sects:\n\nThe now defunct Yapaniya sect followed the Digambara practice of nudity and eating from the hands while standing up along with Śvetāmbara beliefs and texts. They notably also permitted their ascetics to be \"half-clothed\" (\"ardhambara\") in public areas only. The Yapaniya sect was absorbed into the Digambara community during the medieval period.\n\nThe period of 16th to 18th century was a period of reforms in Jainism. The following schools arose during this period :\n\nRecent events lead to dissatisfaction with the monastic tradition and its related emphasis on austerities saw the arising of two new sects within Jainism in the 20th century. These were essentially led by the laity rather than ascetics and soon became a major force to be reckoned with. The non-sectarian cult of Shrimad Rajchandra, who was one of the major influences on Mahatma Gandhi, is now one of the most popular movements. Another cult founded by Kanjisvami, laying stress on theological determinism and \"knowledge of self\", has gained a large following as well.\n\nJains hold the Jain doctrine to be eternal and based on universal principles. In the current time cycle, they trace the origins of its philosophy to Rishabhanatha, the first \"Tīrthankara\". However, the tradition holds that the ancient Jain texts and Purvas which documented the Jain doctrine were lost and hence, historically, the Jain philosophy can be traced from Mahavira's teachings. Post Mahavira many intellectual giants amongst the Jain ascetics contributed and gave a concrete form to the Jain philosophy within the parameters set by Mahavira. Following is the partial list of Jain philosophers and their contributions:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29030581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29030581", "title": "Ka'Kabish", "text": "Ka'Kabish\n\nKa'Kabish is an archaeological site in the Orange Walk District of Belize, Central America, located near the Maya sites of Lamanai, El Pozito, and Blue Creek. It was once a moderate sized city, built as part of the Maya civilization, and has been determined to have been largely autonomous throughout its history. The modern communities of Indian Church and San Filipe are in close proximity to Ka’Kabish, and the Mennonite community of Blue Creek is slightly further afield. A road connecting Indian Church to San Filipe separates the site into two areas, the North Complex and the South Complex.\n\nAlfredo Barrera Vasquez’s \"Diccionario Maya\" defines the name as; \"KA’KAB-IS-AX 10: (place name); ka’kab: village, the seat of population, high land and strong; is: Ipomoea batatas, Lam: sweet + ax: wart; name of the archaeological ruins located near Numk’ini (Nun k’ini, Campeche).\"\n\nThe current name of the site is believed to be relatively modern, but its origin has resisted attempts to be traced.\n\nKa'Kabish is believed to have been initially occupied during the Maya Late Pre-Classic Period (ca. 400 BCE- 200 CE) with one temple securely dated to this time and a second tentatively dated to this period. Material recovered from the tops of some of the buildings suggest that the city was in use at least until end of the Classic Period (900 CE), while evidence from the residential zone surrounding the city indicates a thriving occupation as late as the end of the Early Post-Classic Period (1200 CE).\n\nThe site has only recently become the focus of intensive investigation. A mid-1990s study of the site core revealed a total of 27 monumental structures arranged around two plazas, a subsequent study increased the number of structures to 55.\n\nWithin several of these structures the looted remains of tombs belonging to high status, possibly royal individuals, were discovered. One of these tombs was found to have possessed painted glyphs. The style is part of a tradition of painted tombs first noted at Rio Azul in Northern Guatemala.\n\nKa’Kabish was first visited by David M. Pendergast of the Royal Ontario Museum while he was working at the nearby site of Lamanai, although the lack of a reliable road made work at the site unfeasible at that time. What was noted at the time was the evidence of wholesale illicit excavations, in which virtually every structure had been looted.\n\nThe site was identified initially for potential study in 1990 by members of the Maya Research Program. Due to potentially dangerous conditions in the area, a team did not return to Ka’Kabish until 1995, when formative mapping and surveying of the site was conducted.\n\nDr. Helen R. Haines (TUARC, Trent University) began establishing the groundwork for the Ka’Kabish Archaeological Research Project (KARP) in 2005, with the permission of Belize’s Institute of Archeology, a branch of the National Institute of Culture and History (NICH). KARP’s first field season was 2007, with a focus on clearing vegetation from, and remapping, the site’s South Complex. The North Complex of the site was remapped in 2009.\n\nSince its inception, the Ka'Kabish Archaeological Research Project has expended efforts on mapping the site to gain an understanding of the extent of the site and the types of buildings present. Knowledge of the architectural arrangements provides significant clues as to the importance of the site and the role it might have played in the larger Maya political landscape. Under a grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, first excavations at Ka’Kabish began in 2010 and have continued in the intervening years, with excavation seasons in 2011, 2013, and 2015.\n\nAs of 2013, survey and excavations have located 90 structures, located in 8 groups. Architectural features include two major temples, a ball court with circular ball court marker, and several large platforms (or range buildings) that likely served as royal or high status elite residences and/or administrative structures. Research has also been conducted on the numerous chultuns located at Ka’Kabish.\n\nPreviously, the site sustained damage during the construction of the Indian Church to San Filipe Road, and two buildings were removed and their limestone material used for road fill for the road. Looting has also been a problem, and several structures have been destabilized through looter’s trenches.\n\nUntil 2015, the land on which the site is located was administered by the San Filipe Land Committee, and was owned by three different landowners. Though the owners were supportive of archaeological research, Ka’Kabish was in danger due to encroaching agricultural expansion. This prompted an attempt to purchase the land and, under the auspices of NICH, establish Ka’Kabish as a National Park. A fundraising campaign raised $20,030 CND of a needed $70,000 CND, providing enough money to make a down payment on the site in July 2015. The funds for the campaign were managed by Trent University, and the land was successfully removed from the Agricultural Land Registry.\n\nIn 2013, field school credit for college archaeological students began being offered via Trent University. Students participating in the field school stay in the village of Indian Church during their time with the project.\n\n\n\n \n"}

The group made a wrong turn on the way and ended up at a previously unexplored region and decided to do some surveying. They quickly found some stone artifacts on the site, which they named Lomekwi 3. A year later they returned to the site for a full excavation. Harmand presented her findings at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society on April 14, 2015 and published the full announcement and results on the cover of Nature on May 21, 2015.\n\nAround 20 well preserved artifacts have been dug up at Lomekwi 3 including anvils, cores, and flakes. An additional 130 artifacts were found on the surface. In one instance, Harmand's team was able to match a flake to its core, suggesting a hominin had made and discarded the tool at the site. The tools were generally quite large – larger than the oldest known stone tools, recovered near Gona, in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, in 1992. According to Harmand, it appeared that the tool makers had purposely selected large, heavy blocks of strong stone, ignoring smaller blocks of the same material found in the area. She ruled out the possibility that the tools were actually natural rock formations, saying \"The artifacts were clearly knapped and not the result of accidental fracture of rocks\". Analysis suggested the cores had been rotated as flakes were struck off. The purpose of the tools found at Lomekwi 3 is unclear, as animal bones found at the site do not bear any sign of hominin activity. This is the greatest expression of late Neogene technology in human evolutionary history.\n\nBased on the buried artifacts' stratigraphic position (in undisturbed sediment) relative to two layers of volcanic ash and known magnetic reversals, Harmand and her team dated the tools to 3.3 million years ago. The finds at Lomekwi therefore represent the oldest stone tools ever discovered, predating the Gona tools by 700,000 years. The date also predates the genus \"Homo\" by 500,000 years, suggesting tool making arose with \"Australopithecus\" or \"Kenyanthropus\" (which was found near Lomekwi 3). Previously, evidence of stone tool use by \"Australopithecus\" has been suggested on the basis of marks on animal bones, but those findings have been hotly debated, with no scientific consensus forming on either side of the debate.\n\nHarmand said the Lomekwi 3 artifacts do not fit into the Oldowan tool making tradition and should be considered part of a distinct tradition, which she termed Lomekwian. It has been hypothesized that tool making may have aided in the evolution of \"Homo\" into a distinct genus. However, it is unclear whether the Lomekwian tools are related to those made by \"Homo\" species – it is possible the technology was forgotten and later rediscovered.\n\nIndependent researchers who have seen the tools are generally supportive of Harmand's conclusions. George Washington University anthropologist Alison Brooks said the tools \"could not have been created by natural forces ... the dating evidence is fairly solid.\" Rick Potts, head of the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution, said the tools represented a more primitive style than known human-made tools, but something more sophisticated than what modern chimpanzees do. \"There's no doubt it's purposeful\" toolmaking, he remarked. Paleoanthropologist Zeresenay Alemseged, who was responsible for the earlier research suggesting \"Australopithecus\" had made tools, also backed Harmand's conclusions.\n\n"}

On February 18, 1965, while participating in a peaceful voting rights march in his city, he was beaten by troopers and shot by Alabama State Trooper James Bonard Fowler. Jackson was unarmed and died eight days later in the hospital.\n\nHis death was part of the inspiration for the Selma to Montgomery marches in March 1965, a major event in the Civil Rights Movement that helped gain Congressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This opened the door to millions of African Americans being able to vote again in Alabama and across the South, regaining participation as citizens in the political system for the first time since the turn of the 20th century, when they were disenfranchised by state constitutions and discriminatory practices.\n\nIn 2007 former trooper Fowler was indicted in Jackson's death, and in 2010 he pleaded guilty to manslaughter. He was sentenced to six months in prison.\n\nJimmie Lee Jackson was a deacon of the St. James Baptist Church in Marion, Alabama, ordained in the summer of 1964. Jackson had tried to register to vote for four years, without success under the discriminatory system maintained by Alabama officials. Jackson was inspired by Martin Luther King, Jr., who had come with other Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) staff to Selma, Alabama, to help local activists in their voter registration campaign. Jackson attended meetings several nights a week at Zion's Chapel Methodist Church. His desire to vote led to his death at the hands of an Alabama State Trooper. It inspired Southern Christian Leadership Conference leader James Bevel to initiate and organize the dramatic Selma to Montgomery marches, which directly contributed to President Lyndon Johnson calling for, and Congress passing, the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nOn the night of February 18, 1965, about 500 people organized by the SCLC activist C. T. Vivian left Zion United Methodist Church in Marion and attempted a peaceful walk to the Perry County jail, about a half a block away, where young civil-rights worker James Orange was being held. The marchers planned to sing hymns and return to the church. Police later said that they believed the crowd was planning a jailbreak.\n\nThey were met at the post office by a line of Marion police officers, sheriff's deputies and Alabama state troopers. During the standoff, streetlights were abruptly turned off (some sources say they were shot out by the police), and the police began to beat the protesters. Among those beaten were two United Press International photographers, whose cameras were smashed, and NBC News correspondent Richard Valeriani, who was beaten so badly that he was hospitalized. The marchers turned and scattered back toward the church.\n\nJackson, his mother Viola Jackson, and his 82-year-old grandfather Cager Lee, ran into Mack's Café behind the church, pursued by state troopers. Police clubbed Lee to the floor in the kitchen; when Viola attempted to pull the police off, she was also beaten. When Jackson tried to protect his mother, one trooper threw him against a cigarette machine. A second trooper shot Jackson twice in the abdomen. James Bonard Fowler later admitted to pulling the trigger, saying he thought Jackson was going for his gun. The wounded Jackson fled the café, suffering additional blows by the police, and collapsed in front of the bus station.\n\nIn the presence of FBI officials, Jackson told a lawyer, Oscar Adams of Birmingham, that he was \"clubbed down\" by state troopers after he was shot and had run away from the café. Jackson died of his wounds at Good Samaritan Hospital in Selma, on February 26, 1965. Sister Michael Anne, an administrator at Good Samaritan, later said there were powder burns on Jackson's abdomen, indicating that he was shot at very close range.\n\nJackson was buried in Heard Cemetery, an old slave burial ground, next to his father, with a headstone paid for by the Perry County Civic League. His headstone has been vandalized, bearing the marks of at least one shotgun blast.\n\nJackson's death led James Bevel, SCLC Director of Direct Action and the director of SCLC's Selma Voting Rights Movement, to initiate and organize the first Selma to Montgomery march to present a way for the citizens of Marion and Selma to direct the anger over Jackson's death into a positive outcome. It also was called to publicize the effort to gain voter's registration reform. Held a few days later, on March 7, 1965, the march became known as \"Bloody Sunday\" for the violent response of state troopers and the sheriff's posse, who attacked and beat the protesters after they walked over the Edmund Pettus Bridge and left the city. The events captured international attention, raising widespread support for the voting rights campaign. In the third march to Montgomery, which began on March 21, protesters traveled the entire way, and a total of 25,000 people peacefully entered the city protected by federal troops and Alabama National Guard under federal command.\n\nIn March 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced his federal bill to authorize oversight of local practices and enforcement by the federal government; it was passed by Congress as the Voting Rights Act of 1965. After the act was passed, Jimmie Lee Jackson's grandfather Cager Lee, who had marched with him in February 1965 in Marion, voted for the first time at the age of 84.\n\nA grand jury declined to indict Fowler in September 1965, identifying him only by his surname.\n\nOn May 10, 2007, 42 years after the crime, Fowler was charged with first degree and second-degree murder for Jackson's death, and surrendered to authorities. On November 15, 2010, Fowler pleaded guilty to manslaughter and apologized publicly for killing Jackson. He said he had acted in self-defense. He was sentenced to six months in jail, but served five months due to health problems which required surgery. Arguing that the sentence was too weak, Perry County commissioner Albert Turner, Jr. called the agreement \"a slap in the face of the people of this county\".\n\nIn the 2014 film \"Selma\", Jackson was portrayed by Lakeith Stanfield. The film depicts the events of February 18, 1965, including Jackson's murder.\n\n"}

It is situated on 121a, 31 August 1989 str., in the historical center of Chişinău. In the museum yard there is the Capitoline Wolf, the copy of the one in Rome. Every year almost 15 exhibitions are held in the museum; which are important events in Moldova. The museum is structured into many scientific sections: Ancient History and Archaeology, Medieval History, History of Basarabia, Contemporary History, Treasures.\n\nThe National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova is one of the most important museum institutions of the Republic of Moldova, in terms of its collection and scientific prestige.\n\nThe museum was established on December 21, 1983, when there was issued the Order of the Ministry of Culture No. 561 “On reprofiling of the Museums” (on the basis of the Joint Decree of the Central Committee of the CPM and the Council of Ministers of MSSR “On the utilization of the historical monument – the edifice of the former Chisinau Boys’ Gymnasia where S. Lazo studied” from 29 November 1983).\nThe State Museum of History of MSSR was created on the basis of the Republican Museum of Military Glory, into which it was incorporated, and the historical collection of the State Museum of History and Regional Studies of MSSR. It was housed in the restoring historical building of the former Chisinau Boys’ Gymnasia No.1, where formerly the Republican Museum of Military Glory had been located.\n\nOn October 22, 1991, by the Order of the Ministry of Culture No. 231 “On perfection of the republican museums’ activity”, the State Museum of History of MSSR was renamed to the National Museum of History of Moldova.\n\nIn 2006 the National Museum of History of Moldova was reorganized into the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova through absorption of the Museum of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova, according to the Decree of the Government of the Republic of Moldova No.1326 “On the measures of optimization of infrastructure in the field of science and innovation” from 14 December 2005.\n\nAt present the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova is subordinate to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Moldova, its scientific activity being coordinated by the Academy of Sciences of Moldova.\n\nThe museum collections, which initially consisted of the collections of the Republican Museum of Military Glory and the State Museum of History and Regional Studies of MSSR, every year were enriching with items of real scientific value through research, donations, and acquisitions. Besides, in 1989–1995 and 2006–2007, large transfers of collections from a number of broken up museums – the Republican Museum of Friendship Among the Peoples, the Museum of History of the CPM, the Republican Museum of History of the Komsomol, the Republican Museum of G.I. Kotovsky and S.G. Lazo, the Republican Museum of the History of Religion, the Memorial Museum of Bulgarian Volunteers, and the Museum of Archaeology of The Academy of Sciences of Moldova – also contributed to the growth and diversity of the museum property.\n\nToday, the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova owns 322,172 items, the diversity of which covers the history of Moldova over the centuries, from prehistoric times to the present, telling about the land, facts, events, and outstanding people.\n\nIn 1991, the first permanent historical exhibition “Pages of Centuries-old History of Moldova”, covering the period from the oldest times to 1940, was opened to the public. It was located in three rooms of the 1st floor, with an area of 645 sq. m., containing about 900 exhibit items. The exhibition illustrated the features of the area between the Prut and Dniester in the context of the history of medieval Moldavian state. As to the period after the dismemberment of Moldova in 1812, in the exhibition there was presented only the history of Bessarabia.\n\nIn 1997, the permanent historical exhibition was redesigned in content, placement, and by the method of presentation. It expanded to the entire first floor, occupying six rooms with an area of 1,400 sq. m. Chronological framework of the exhibition includes the period from the Paleolithic to the end of the fifth decade of the 20th century.\nIn 2006–2007, the museum was in a new process of rebuilding of the permanent exhibition, intending to make radical changes in terms of vision and the content of exhibits, representing the section of prehistory and ancient history. Underlying these changes are the collections transferred from the former Museum of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova. Of course, the current formula of the permanent exhibition is an intermediate. Now there is conceptually and thematically developing a new vision of the exhibition of the National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova.\n\nIn August 1990, in the ground floor of the museum there was open to the public the Diorama of the Iasi – Chisinau Operation, and in 1994, in the basement – the exhibition of items made of precious metals “Treasure-house”. \n\nThe museum also offers the public diverse temporary exhibitions, which complement the permanent exhibition and contribute to the promotion of the museum cultural and historical property. During the 27 years of its existence, the museum has organized about 189 temporary exhibitions (at the museum, outside the museum, and abroad), based on its own collections as well as in collaboration with other cultural and research institutions.\n\nThe National Museum of Archaeology and History of Moldova from the very beginning was located in the historical building of the former Chisinau Boys’ Gymnasia No.1, later the Boy’s Lyceum named after B.P. Hasdeu (in 1945–1963 in the premises there was housed the frontier detachment “Nistru”, and in 1963–1977 – the Polytechnic Institute), that was in the process of restoration.\n\nThe earthquake of 1977 has played a tragic role in the history of this monument, causing serious damage that could lead to a total destruction of the building. Restoration work, started in 1979, was halted because, due to the severe destruction, the building was beyond repair. \n\nThe old building was demolished and replaced by a new one (the construction lasted from 1980 to 1987), which retained only the exterior of the historical monument, built in eclectic style, and decorative elements of the gymnasia assembly hall, repeated in three domical rooms of the new building. \n\nThus, the new museum edifice, in operation from 1987, is a modern two-storey monumental building facing the 31 August 1989 Street. It has 12 exhibition rooms and a diorama, with a total area of 5,700 sq. m.\n\nThe museum has five branches: Exhibitions of Military Technology, The Sciusev House and Museum (both in Chişinău), The C. Stamati House and Museum (Ocniţa), Lazo’s Manson (in Piatra), Carol the XIIth's House and Museum in Varniţa.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "42972915", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42972915", "title": "Regulation of hydraulic fracturing", "text": "Regulation of hydraulic fracturing\n\nCountries using or considering to use hydraulic fracturing have implemented different regulations, including developing federal and regional legislation, and local zoning limitations. In 2011, after public pressure France became the first nation to ban hydraulic fracturing, based on the precautionary principle as well as the principal of preventive and corrective action of environmental hazards. The ban was upheld by an October 2013 ruling of the Constitutional Council. Some other countries have placed a temporary moratorium on the practice. Countries like the United Kingdom and South Africa, have lifted their bans, choosing to focus on regulation instead of outright prohibition. Germany has announced draft regulations that would allow using hydraulic fracturing for the exploitation of shale gas deposits with the exception of wetland areas.\n\nThe European Union has adopted a recommendation for minimum principles for using high-volume hydraulic fracturing. Its regulatory regime requires full disclosure of all additives. In the United States, the Ground Water Protection Council launched FracFocus.org, an online voluntary disclosure database for hydraulic fracturing fluids funded by oil and gas trade groups and the U.S. Department of Energy. Hydraulic fracturing is excluded from the Safe Drinking Water Act's underground injection control's regulation, except when diesel fuel is used. The EPA assures surveillance of the issuance of drilling permits when diesel fuel is employed.\n\nOn 17 December 2014, New York state issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing, becoming the second state in the United States to issue such a ban after Vermont.\n\nThe main tool used by this approach is risk assessment. A risk assessment method, based on experimenting and assessing risk ex-post, once the technology is in place. In the context of hydraulic fracturing, it means that drilling permits are issued and exploitation conducted before the potential risks on the environment and human health are known. The risk-based approach mainly relies on a discourse that sacralizes technological innovations as an intrinsic good, and the analysis of such innovations, such as hydraulic fracturing, is made on a sole cost-benefit framework, which does not allow prevention or ex-ante debates on the use of the technology. This is also referred to as \"learning-by-doing\". A risk assessment method has for instance led to regulations that exist in the hydraulic fracturing in the United States (EPA will release its study on the effect of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater in 2014, though hydraulic fracturing has been used for more than 60 years. Commissions that have been implemented in the US to regulate the use of hydraulic fracturing have been created after hydraulic fracturing had started in their area of regulation. This is for instance the case in the Marcellus shale area where three regulatory committees were implemented ex-post.\n\nAcademic scholars who have studied the perception of hydraulic fracturing in the North of England have raised two main critiques of this approach. Firstly, it takes scientific issues out of the public debate since there is no debate on the use of a technology but on its effects. Secondly, it does not prevent environmental harm from happening since risks are taken then assessed instead of evaluated then taken as it would be the case with a precautionary approach to scientific debates. The relevance and reliability of risk assessments in hydraulic fracturing communities has also been debated amongst environmental groups, health scientists, and industry leaders. A study has epitomized this point: the participants to regulatory committees of the Marcellus shale have, for a majority, raised concerns about public health although nobody in these regulatory committees had expertise in public health. That highlights a possible underestimation of public health risks due to hydraulic fracturing. Moreover, more than a quarter of the participants raised concerns about the neutrality of the regulatory committees given the important weigh of the hydraulic fracturing industry. The risks, to some like the participants of the Marcellus Shale regulatory committees, are overplayed and the current research is insufficient in showing the link between hydraulic fracturing and adverse health effects, while to others like local environmental groups the risks are obvious and risk assessment is underfunded.\n\nThe second approach relies on the precautionary principle and the principal of preventive and corrective action of environmental hazards, using the best available techniques with an acceptable economic cost to insure the protection, the valuation, the restoration, management of spaces, resources and natural environments, of animal and vegetal species, of ecological diversity and equilibriums. The precautionary approach has led to regulations as implemented in France and Vermont, banning hydraulic fracturing.\n\nSuch an approach is called upon by social sciences and the public as studies have shown in the North of England and Australia. Indeed, in Australia, the anthropologist who studied the use of hydraulic fracturing concluded that the risk-based approach was closing down the debate on the ethics of such a practice, therefore avoiding questions on broader concerns that merely the risks implied by hydraulic fracturing. In the North of England, levels of concerns registered in the deliberative focus groups studied were higher regarding the framing of the debate, meaning the fact that people did not have a voice in the energetic choices that were made, including the use of hydraulic fracturing. Concerns relative to risks of seismicity and health issues were also important to the public, but less than this. A reason for that is that being withdrawn the right to participate in the decision-making triggered opposition of both supporters and opponents of hydraulic fracturing.\n\nThe points made to defend such an approach often relate to climate change and the impact on the direct environment; related to public concerns on the rural landscape for instance in the UK. Energetic choices indeed affect climate change since greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels extraction such as shale gas and oil contribute to climate change. Therefore, people have in the UK raised concerns about the exploitation of these resources, not just hydraulic fracturing as a method. They would hence prefer a precaution-based approach to decide whether or not, regarding the issue of climate change, they want to exploit shale gas and oil.\n\nThere are two main areas of interest regarding how debates on hydraulic fracturing for the exploitation of unconventional oil and gas have been conducted.\n\nA risk-based approach is often referred to as \"learning-by-doing\" by social sciences. Social sciences have raised two main critiques of this approach. Firstly, it takes scientific issues out of the public debate since there is no debate on the use of a technology but on its impacts. Secondly, it does not prevent environmental harm from happening since risks are taken then assessed instead of evaluated then taken. Public concerns are shown to be really linked to these issues of scientific approach. Indeed, the public in the North of England for instance fears \"the denial of the deliberation of the values embedded in the development and application of that technology, as well as the future it is working towards\" more than risks themselves. The legitimacy of the method is only questioned after its implementation, not before. This vision separates risks and effects from the values entitled by a technology. For instance, hydraulic fracturing entitles a transitional fuel for its supporters whereas for its opponents it represents a fossil fuel exacerbating the greenhouse effect and global warming. Not asking these questions leads to seeing only the mere economic cost-benefit analysis.\n\nThis is linked to a pattern of preventing non-experts from taking part in scientific-technological debates, including their ethical issues. An answer to that problem is seen to be increased public participation so as to have the public deciding which issues to address and what political and ethical norms to adopt as a society. Another public concern with the \"learning-by-doing\" approach is that the speed of innovation may exceed the speed of regulation and since innovation is seen as serving private interests, potentially at the expense of social good, it is a matter of public concern. Science and Technology Studies have theorized \"slowing-down\" and the precautionary principle as answers. The claim is that the possibility of an issue is legitimate and should be taken into account before any action is taken.\n\nIssues also exist regarding the way risk assessment is conducted and whether it reflects some interests more than others. Firstly, an issue exists about whether risk assessment authorities are able to judge the impact of hydraulic fracturing in public health. A study conducted on the advisory committees of the Marcellus Shale gas area has shown that not a single member of these committees had public health expertise and that some concern existed about whether the commissions were not biased in their composition. Indeed, among 51 members of the committees, there is no evidence that a single one has any expertise in environmental public health, even after enlarging the category of experts to \"include medical and health professionals who could be presumed to have some health background related to environmental health, however minimal\". This cannot be explained by the purpose of the committee since all three executive orders of the different committees mentioned environmental public health related issues. Another finding of the authors is that a quarter of the opposed comments mentioned the possibility of bias in favor of gas industries in the composition of committees. The authors conclude saying that political leaders may not want to raise public health concerns not to handicap further economic development due to hydraulic fracturing.\n\nSecondly, the conditions to allow hydraulic fracturing are being increasingly strengthened due to the move from governmental agencies' authority over the issue to elected officials' authority over it. The Shale Gas Drilling Safety Review Act of 2014 issued in Maryland forbids the issuance of drilling permits until a high standard \"risk assessment of public health and environmental hazards relating to hydraulic fracturing activities\" is conducted for at least 18 months based on the Governor's executive order.\n\nA qualitative study using deliberative focus groups has been conducted in the North of England, where there is a big shale gas reservoir exploited by hydraulic fracturing. These group discussions reflect many concerns on the issue of the use of unconventional oil and gas. There is a concern about trust linked with a doubt on the ability or will of public authorities to work for the greater social good since private interests and profits of industrial companies are seen as corruptive powers. Alienation is also a concern since the feeling of a game rigged against the public rises due to \"decision making being made on your behalf without being given the possibility to voice an opinion\". Exploitation also arises since economic rationality that is seen as favoring short-termism is accused of seducing policy-makers and industry. Risk is accentuated by what is hydraulic fracturing as well as what is at stake, and \"blind spots\" of current knowledge as well as risk assessment analysis are accused of increasing the potentiality of negative outcomes. Uncertainty and ignorance are seen as too important in the issue of hydraulic fracturing and decisions are therefore perceived as rushed, which is why participants favored some form of precautionary approach. There is a major fear on the possible disconnection between the public's and the authorities' visions of what is a good choice for the good reasons.\n\nIt also appears that media coverage and institutional responses are widely inaccurate to answer public concerns. Indeed, institutional responses to public concerns are mostly inadequate since they focus on risk assessment and giving information to the public that is considered anxious because ignorant. But public concerns are much wider and it appears that public knowledge on hydraulic fracturing is rather good.\n\nThe hydraulic fracturing industry has lobbied for permissive regulation in Europe, the US federal government, and US states. On 20 March 2015 the rules for disclosing the chemicals used were tightened by the Obama administration. The new rules give companies involved 30 days from the beginning of an operation on federal land to disclose those chemicals.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18069384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18069384", "title": "Regulation of nanotechnology", "text": "Regulation of nanotechnology\n\nBecause of the ongoing controversy on the implications of nanotechnology, there is significant debate concerning whether nanotechnology or nanotechnology-based products merit special government regulation. This mainly relates to when to assess new substances prior to their release into the market, community and environment.\n\nNanotechnology refers to an increasing number of commercially available products – from socks and trousers to tennis racquets and cleaning cloths. Such nanotechnologies and their accompanying industries have triggered calls for increased community participation and effective regulatory arrangements. However, these calls have presently not led to such comprehensive regulation to oversee research and the commercial application of nanotechnologies, or any comprehensive labeling for products that contain nanoparticles or are derived from nano-processes.\n\nRegulatory bodies such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. or the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate of the European Commission have started dealing with the potential risks posed by nanoparticles. So far, neither engineered nanoparticles nor the products and materials that contain them are subject to any special regulation regarding production, handling or labelling.\n\nStudies of the health impact of airborne particles generally shown that for toxic materials, smaller particles are more toxic. This is due in part to the fact that, given the same mass per volume, the dose in terms of particle numbers increases as particle size decreases.\n\nBased upon available data, it has been argued that current risk assessment methodologies are not suited to the hazards associated with nanoparticles; in particular, existing toxicological and eco-toxicological methods are not up to the task; exposure evaluation (dose) needs to be expressed as quantity of nanoparticles and/or surface area rather than simply mass; equipment for routine detecting and measuring nanoparticles in air, water, or soil is inadequate; and very little is known about the physiological responses to nanoparticles.\n\nRegulatory bodies in the U.S. as well as in the EU have concluded that nanoparticles form the potential for an entirely new risk and that it is necessary to carry out an extensive analysis of the risk. The challenge for regulators is whether a matrix can be developed which would identify nanoparticles and more complex nanoformulations which are likely to have special toxicological properties or whether it is more reasonable for each particle or formulation to be tested separately.\n\nThe maintains a database and Virtual Journal of scientific papers on environmental, health and safety research on nanoparticles. The database currently has over 2000 entries indexed by particle type, exposure pathway and other criteria. The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies (PEN) currently lists 807 products that manufacturers have voluntarily identified that use nanotechnology. No labeling is required by the FDA so that number could be significantly higher. \"The use of nanotechnology in consumer products and industrial applications is growing rapidly, with the products listed in the PEN inventory showing just the tip of the iceberg\" according to PEN Project Director David Rejeski . A list of those products that have been voluntarily disclosed by their manufacturers is located here .\n\nThe Material Safety Data Sheet that must be issued for certain materials often does not differentiate between bulk and nanoscale size of the material in question and even when it does these MSDS are advisory only.\n\nMany argue that government has a responsibility to provide opportunities for the public to be involved in the development of new forms of science and technology. Community engagement can be achieved through various means or mechanisms. An online journal article identifies traditional approaches such as referenda, consultation documents, and advisory committees that include community members and other stakeholders. Other conventional approaches include public meetings and \"closed\" dialog with stakeholders. More contemporary engagement processes that have been employed to include community members in decisions about nanotechnology include citizens' juries and consensus conferences. Leach and Scoones (2006, p. 45) argue that since that “most debates about science and technology options involve uncertainty, and often ignorance, public debate about regulatory regimes is essential.”\n\nIt has been argued that limited nanotechnology labeling and regulation may exacerbate potential human and environmental health and safety issues associated with nanotechnology, and that the development of comprehensive regulation of nanotechnology will be vital to ensure that the potential risks associated with the research and commercial application of nanotechnology do not overshadow its potential benefits. Regulation may also be required to meet community expectations about responsible development of nanotechnology, as well as ensuring that public interests are included in shaping the development of nanotechnology.\n\nCommunity education, engagement and consultation tend to occur \"downstream\": once there is at least a moderate level of awareness, and often during the process of disseminating and adapting technologies. \"Upstream\" engagement, by contrast, occurs much earlier in the innovation cycle and involves: \"dialogue and debate about future technology options and pathways, bringing the often expert-led approaches to horizon scanning, technology foresight and scenario planning to involve a wider range of perspectives and inputs.\" Daniel Sarewitz Director of Arizona State University’s Consortium on Science, Policy and Outcomes, argues that \"by the time new devices reach the stage of commercialization and regulation, it is usually too late to alter them to correct problems.\" However, Xenos, et al. argue that upstream engagement can be utilized in this area through anticipated discussion with peers. Upstream engagement in this sense is \"meant to create the best possible conditions for sound policy making and public judgments based on carefull assessment of objective information\". Discussion may act as a catalyst for upstream engagement by prompting accountability for individuals to seek and process additional information (\"anticipatory elaboration\"). However, though anticipated discussion did lead to participants seeking further information, Xenos et al. found that factual information was not primarily sought out; instead, individuals sought out opinion pieces and editorials.\n\nThe stance that the research, development and use of nanotechnology should be subject to control by the public sector is sometimes referred to as nanosocialism.\n\nThe question of whether nanotechnology represents something 'new' must be answered to decide how best nanotechnology should be regulated. The Royal Society recommended that the UK government assess chemicals in the form of nanoparticles or nanotubes as new substances. Subsequent to this, in 2007 a coalition of over forty groups called for nanomaterials to be classified as new substances, and regulated as such.\n\nDespite these recommendations, chemicals comprising nanoparticles that have previously been subject to assessment and regulation may be exempt from regulation, regardless of the potential for different risks and impacts. In contrast, nanomaterials are often recognized as 'new' from the perspective of intellectual property rights (IPRs), and as such are commercially protected via patenting laws.\n\nThere is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology. While some non-nanotechnology specific regulatory agencies currently cover some products and processes (to varying degrees) – by \"bolting on\" nanotechnology to existing regulations – there are clear gaps in these regimes. This enables some nanotechnology applications to figuratively \"slip through the cracks\" without being covered by any regulations. An example of this has occurred in the US, and involves nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for use in sunscreen where they create a clearer cosmetic appearance. In this case, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the immediate health effects of exposure to nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TI02) for consumers. However, they did not review its impacts for aquatic ecosystems when the sunscreen rubs off, nor did the EPA, or any other agency. Similarly the Australian equivalent of the FDA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved the use of nanoparticles in sunscreens (without the requirement for package labelling) after a thorough review of the literature, on the basis that although nanoparticles of TI02 and zinc oxide (ZN0) in sunscreens do produce free radicals and oxidative DNA damage \"in vitro\", such particles were unlikely to pass the dead outer cells of the stratum corneum of human skin; a finding which some academics have argued seemed not to apply the precautionary principle in relation to prolonged use on children with cut skin, the elderly with thin skin, people with diseased skin or use over flexural creases. Doubts over the TGA's decision were raised with publication of a paper showing that the uncoated anatase form of TI02 used in some Australian sunscreens caused a photocatalytic reaction that degraded the surface of newly installed prepainted steel roofs in places where they came in contact with the sunscreen coated hands of workmen. Such gaps in regulation are likely to continue alongside the development and commercialization of increasingly complex second and third generation nanotechnologies.\n\nNanomedicines are just beginning to enter drug regulatory processes, but within a few decades could comprise a dominant group within the class of innovative pharmaceuticals, the current thinking of government safety and cost-effectiveness regulators appearing to be that these products give rise to few if any nano-specific issues. Some academics (such as Thomas Alured Faunce) have challenged that proposition and suggest that nanomedicines may create unique or heightened policy challenges for government systems of cost-effectiveness as well as safety regulation. There are also significant public good aspects to the regulation of nanotechnology, particularly with regard to ensuring that industry involvement in standard-setting does not become a means of reducing competition and that nanotechnology policy and regulation encourages new models of safe drug discovery and development more systematically targeted at the global burden of disease.\n\nSelf-regulation attempts may well fail, due to the inherent conflict of interest in asking any organization to police itself. If the public becomes aware of this failure, an external, independent organization is often given the duty of policing them, sometimes with highly punitive measures taken against the organization.\nThe Food and Drug Administration notes that it only regulates on the basis of voluntary claims made by the product manufacturer. If no claims are made by a manufacturer, then the FDA may be unaware of nanotechnology being employed.\n\nYet regulations worldwide still fail to distinguish between materials in their nanoscale and bulk form. This means that nanomaterials remain effectively unregulated; there is no regulatory requirement for nanomaterials to face new health and safety testing or environmental impact assessment prior to their use in commercial products, if these materials have already been approved in bulk form. The health risks of nanomaterials are of particular concern for workers who may face occupational exposure to nanomaterials at higher levels, and on a more routine basis, than the general public.\n\nThere is no international regulation of nanoproducts or the underlying nanotechnology. Nor are there any internationally agreed definitions or terminology for nanotechnology, no internationally agreed protocols for toxicity testing of nanoparticles, and no standardized protocols for evaluating the environmental impacts of nanoparticles.\n\nSince products that are produced using nanotechnologies will likely enter international trade, it is argued that it will be necessary to harmonize nanotechnology standards across national borders. There is concern that some countries, most notably developing countries, will be excluded from international standards negotiations. The Institute for Food and Agricultural Standards notes that “developing countries should have a say in international nanotechnology standards development, even if they lack capacity to enforce the standards\". (p. 14).\n\nConcerns about monopolies and concentrated control and ownership of new nanotechnologies were raised in community workshops in Australia in 2004.\n\nWide use of the term nanotechnology in recent years has created the impression that regulatory frameworks are suddenly having to contend with entirely new challenges that they are unequipped to deal with. Many regulatory systems around the world already assess new substances or products for safety on a case by case basis, before they are permitted on the market. These regulatory systems have been assessing the safety of nanometre scale molecular arrangements for many years and many substances comprising nanometre scale particles have been in use for decades e.g. Carbon black, Titanium dioxide, Zinc oxide, Bentonite, Aluminum silicate, Iron oxides, Silicon dioxide, Diatomaceous earth, Kaolin, Talc, Montmorillonite, Magnesium oxide, Copper sulphate.\n\nThese existing approval frameworks almost universally use the best available science to assess safety and do not approve substances or products with an unacceptable risk benefit profile. One proposal is to simply treat particle size as one of the several parameters defining a substance to be approved, rather than creating special rules for all particles of a given size regardless of type. A major argument against special regulation of nanotechnology is that the projected applications with the greatest impact are far in the future, and it is unclear how to regulate technologies whose feasibility is speculative at this point. In the meantime, it has been argued that the immediate applications of nanomaterials raise challenges not much different from those of introducing any other new material, and can be dealt with by minor tweaks to existing regulatory schemes rather than sweeping regulation of entire scientific fields.\n\nA truly precautionary approach to regulation could severely impede development in the field of nanotechnology safety studies are required for each and every nanoscience application. While the outcome of these studies can form the basis for government and international regulations, a more reasonable approach might be development of a risk matrix that identifies likely culprits.\n\nIn its seminal 2004 report \"Nanoscience and Nanotechnologies: Opportunities and Uncertainties\", the United Kingdom's Royal Society concluded that:\n\nbut have recommended that nanomaterials be regulated as new chemicals, that research laboratories and factories treat nanomaterials \"as if they were hazardous\", that release of nanomaterials into the environment be avoided as far as possible, and that products containing nanomaterials be subject to new safety testing requirements prior to their commercial release.\n\nThe 2004 report by the UK Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineers noted that existing UK regulations did not require additional testing when existing substances were produced in nanoparticulate form. The Royal Society recommended that such regulations were revised so that “chemicals produced in the form of nanoparticles and nanotubes be treated as new chemicals under these regulatory frameworks” (p.xi). They also recommended that existing regulation be modified on a precautionary basis because they expect that “the toxicity of chemicals in the form of free nanoparticles and nanotubes cannot be predicted from their toxicity in a larger form and... in some cases they will be more toxic than the same mass of the same chemical in larger form.”\n\nThe Better Regulation Commission's earlier 2003 report had recommended that the UK Government:\n\nThese recommendations were accepted in principle by the UK Government. Noting that there was “no obvious focus for an informed public debate of the type suggested by the Task Force”, the UK government's response was to accept the recommendations.\n\nThe Royal Society's 2004 report identified two distinct governance issues:\n\nRather than adopt a new nano-specific regulatory framework, the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convenes an 'interest group' each quarter with representatives of FDA centers that have responsibility for assessment and regulation of different substances and products. This interest group ensures coordination and communication. A September 2009 FDA document called for identifying sources of nanomaterials, how they move in the environment, the problems they might cause for people, animals and plants, and how these problems could be avoided or mitigated.\n\nThe Bush administration in 2007 decided that no special regulations or labeling of nanoparticles were required. Critics derided this as treating consumers like a \"guinea pig\" without sufficient notice due to lack of labelling.\n\nBerkeley, CA is currently the only city in the United States to regulate nanotechnology. Cambridge, MA in 2008 considered enacting a similar law, but the committee it instituted to study the issue Cambridge recommended against regulation in its final report, recommending instead other steps to facilitate information-gathering about potential effects of nanomaterials.\n\nOn December 10, 2008 the U.S. National Research Council released a report calling for more regulation of nanotechnology.\n\nAssembly Bill (AB) 289 (2006) authorizes the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) within the California Environmental Protection Agency and other agencies to request information on environmental and health impacts from chemical manufacturers and importers, including testing techniques.\n\nIn October 2008, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC), within the California Environmental Protection Agency, announced its intent to request information regarding analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information from manufacturers of carbon nanotubes. DTSC is exercising its authority under the California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020. These sections were added as a result of the adoption of Assembly Bill AB 289 (2006). They are intended to make information on the fate and transport, detection and analysis, and other information on chemicals more available. The law places the responsibility to provide this information to the Department on those who manufacture or import the chemicals.\n\nOn January 22, 2009, a formal information request letter was sent to manufacturers who produce or import carbon nanotubes in California, or who may export carbon nanotubes into the State. This letter constitutes the first formal implementation of the authorities placed into statute by AB 289 and is directed to manufacturers of carbon nanotubes, both industry and academia within the State, and to manufacturers outside California who export carbon nanotubes to California. This request for information must be met by the manufacturers within one year. DTSC is waiting for the upcoming January 22, 2010 deadline for responses to the data call-in.\n\nThe California Nano Industry Network and DTSC hosted a full-day symposium on November 16, 2009 in Sacramento, CA. This symposium provided an opportunity to hear from nanotechnology industry experts and discuss future regulatory considerations in California.\n\nDTSC is expanding the Specific Chemical Information Call-in to members of the nanometal oxides. Interested individuals are encouraged to visit their website for the latest up-to-date information at http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/TechnologyDevelopment/Nanotechnology/index.cfm.\n\nOn December 21, 2010, the Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) initiated the second Chemical Information Call-in for six nanomaterials: nano cerium oxide, nano silver, nano titanium dioxide, nano zero valent iron, nano zinc oxide, and quantum dots. DTSC sent a formal information request letter to forty manufacturers who produce or import the six nanomaterials in California, or who may export them into the State. The Chemical Information Call-in is meant to identify information gaps of these six nanomaterials and to develop further knowledge of their analytical test methods, fate and transport in the environment, and other relevant information under California Health and Safety Code, Chapter 699, sections 57018-57020. DTSC completed the carbon nanotube information call-in in June 2010.\n\nDTSC partners with University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), Santa Barbara (UCSB), and Riverside (UCR), University of Southern California (USC), Stanford University, Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (CEIN), and The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) on safe nanomaterial handling practices.\n\nDTSC is interested in expanding the Chemical Information Call-in to members of the bominated flame retardants, members of the methyl siloxanes, ocean plastics, nano-clay, and other emerging chemicals.\n\nThe European Union has formed a group to study the implications of nanotechnology called the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks which has published a list of risks associated with nanoparticles.\n\nConsequently, manufacturers and importers of carbon products, including carbon nano-tubes will have to submit full health and safety data within a year or so in order to comply with REACH.\n\nA number of European member states have called for the creation of either national or European nanomaterials registries. France, Belgium, Sweden, and Denmark have established national registries of nanomaterials. In Addition, the European Commission requested the Europeach Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to create a European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON) that aims at collecting publically available information on the safety and markets of nanomaterials and nanotechnology. \n\nIn January 2008, a coalition of over 40 civil society groups endorsed a statement of principles calling for precautionary action related to nanotechnology. The coalition called for strong, comprehensive oversight of the new technology and its products in the International Center for Technology Assessment's report \"Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nano materials\", which states:\n\nThe group has urged action based on eight principles. They are (1) A Precautionary Foundation (2) Mandatory Nano-specific Regulations (3) Health and Safety of the Public and Workers (4) Environmental Protection (5) Transparency (6) Public Participation (7) Inclusion of Broader Impacts and (8) Manufacturer Liability.\n\nSome NGOs, including Friends of the Earth, are calling for the formation of a separate nanotechnology specific regulatory framework for the regulation of nanotechnology. In Australia, Friends of the Earth propose the establishment of a Nanotechnology Regulatory Coordination Agency, overseen by a Foresight and Technology Assessment Board. The advantage of this arrangement is that it could ensure a centralized body of experts that are able to provide oversight across the range of nano-products and sectors. It is also argued that a centralized regulatory approach would simplify the regulatory environment, thereby supporting industry innovation. A National Nanotechnology Regulator could coordinate existing regulations related to nanotechnology (including intellectual property, civil liberties, product safety, occupation health and safety, environmental and international law). Regulatory mechanisms could vary from \"hard law at one extreme through licensing and codes of practice to 'soft' self-regulation and negotiation in order to influence behavior.\" \nThe formation of national nanotechnology regulatory bodies may also assist in establishing global regulatory frameworks.\n\nIn early 2008, The UK's largest organic certifier, the Soil Association, announced that its organic standard would exclude nanotechnology, recognizing the associated human and environmental health and safety risks. Certified organic standards in Australia exclude engineered nanoparticles. It appears likely that other organic certifiers will also follow suit. The Soil Association was also the first to declare organic standards free from genetic engineering.\n\nRegulation of nanotechnology will require a definition of the size, in which particles and processes are recognized as operating at the nano-scale. The size-defining characteristic of nanotechnology is the subject of significant debate, and varies to include particles and materials in the scale of at least 100 to 300 nanometers (nm). Friends of the Earth Australia recommend defining nano-particles up to 300 nanometers (nm) in size. They argue that \"particles up to a few hundred nanometers in size share many of the novel biological behaviors of nano-particles, including novel toxicity risks\", and that \"nano-materials up to approximately 300 nm in size can be taken up by individual cells\". The UK Soil Association define nanotechnology to include manufactured nano-particles where the mean particle size is 200 nm or smaller. The U.S. National Nanotechnology Initiative defines nanotechnology as “the understanding and control of matter at dimensions of roughly 1 to 100 nm.\n\nRegulatory frameworks for chemicals tend to be triggered by mass thresholds. This is certainly the case for the management of toxic chemicals in Australia through the National pollutant inventory. However, in the case of nanotechnology, nano-particle applications are unlikely to exceed these thresholds (tonnes/kilograms) due to the size and weight of nano-particles. As such, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars questions the usefulness of regulating nanotechnologies on the basis of their size/weight alone. They argue, for example, that the toxicity of nano-participles is more related to surface area than weight, and that emerging regulations should also take account of such factors.\n"}

As a young man, he was influenced by symbolism and the writings of Lautréamont and Alfred Jarry, and he developed a passion for theatre and poetry. A year after his \"baccalauréat\", he published a collection of poems, \"Le Faune noir\".\n\nDuring his three-year-long military service, he met Marcel Arland, François Baron, Georges Limbour and René Crevel, who together founded the literary revue, \"Aventure\". Through the group, Vitrac met André Breton and Louis Aragon at Café Certa in 1921, where many Dada activities took place until it became one of the surrealist group's headquarters. In the early twenties, Vitrac joined the surrealist movement and contributed to the first few editions of \"La Révolution Surréaliste\". Slowly segregated from the group along with Antonin Artaud, together they created the Théatre Alfred-Jarry in 1926, where they produced some of their most important plays such as \"The Mysteries of Love\" (\"Les Mystères de l'amour\", 1927) and \"Victor, or Power to the Children\" (\"Victor ou les enfants au pouvoir\", 1928), setting the tone for the Theatre of the Absurd, twenty years before Ionesco. \"The Cambridge Guide to Theatre\" describes \"The Mysteries of Love\" as a masterpiece of surrealist theatre. It is now considered a key play in 20th-century French theatre.\n\nVitrac joined Georges Bataille as one of the signatories of \"Un Cadavre\" against Breton and contributed to \"Documents\" with articles on \"Gaston-Louis Roux\" (1929, issue 7), \"The Abduction of the Sabines\" (1930, issue 6) and a poem, \"Humorage to Picasso\" (1930, issue 3), dedicated to the artist. From 1931, he worked as a journalist while further exploring burlesque style playwriting, which often operated between boulevard comedy and intimate tragedy. His multi-thematic \"Coup de Trafalgar\" (1934) and \"Les Demoiselles du large\" (1938) gained as little recognition as his more slapstick plays such as \"Le Loup-Garou\" (1939) and \"Le Sabre de mon père\" (1951).\n\nVitrac died in Paris in 1952.\n\nOnly after his death did Vitrac reach popular stardom status with Jean Anouilh's 1962 production of \"Victor, or Power to the Children\".\n"}

The prehistoric megaliths found there are believed to have been used as foundation pillars for houses, with some of them weighing up to 35 tons. Their exact age, origin, methods of quarrying and means of transportation have not been determined.\n\nA latte stone pillar (also called a taga stone) is a two-piece structure consisting of a base (haligi) and hemispherical cap (tasa), with the flat side turned upwards. It is believed that the prehistoric latte stone pillars were used as housing foundations for the indigenous culture of the Marianas. The homes sat on top of two parallel rows of the pillars, and the Chamorro, or their ancestors, buried their dead between the rows. The stones pre-date any retained oral history of the Chamorro, who cite the original source of the stones as the \"taotaomona\" (before time people). The exact age of the stones has not been determined, but some are believed to date back to at least 845 AD. Carbon dating places the indigenous population as far back as 3,000 BC.\n\nThe Rota quarry is the site of the largest unearthed latte stones in the Marianas. Nine haligi and seven tasa have been found there.\n\nSome of the abandoned megaliths would stand approximately high if the haligi had been topped with tasa and erected upright. The tasa at the quarry measure approximately across and high. The stones are unfinished, and there is no record or indication of why the site was suddenly abandoned.\nTheories have been put forward regarding the methods of quarrying, transporting and erecting the latte stones, but nothing has been scientifically proven.\n\nWhen upright, the megaliths from Rota Latte Stone Quarry would be per 0.5 m taller than the tallest existing latte stones at the House of Taga in Tinian Island. This might be indicative of competition between different groups, striving to build the most impressive sets of latte stones.\n\nLegend credits the origin of the quarry to a mythological chief named Taga, who quarried the stones at Rota before abandoning the site and later erecting the House of Taga on Tinian. A different legend tells of ghosts carrying the stones.\n"}

Der Nersessian was a renowned academic and a pioneer in Armenian art history. She taught at several institutions in the United States, including Wellesley College in Massachusetts and as Henri Focillon Professor of Art and Archaeology at Harvard University. She was a senior fellow at Dumbarton Oaks, its deputy director from 1954–55 and 1961–62 and a member of its Board of Scholars. Der Nersessian was also a member of several international institutions such as the British Academy (1975), the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres (1978) and the Armenian Academy of Sciences (1966).\n\nDer Nersessian was born the youngest of three children in Constantinople in 1896. She came from a well-to-do family and her maternal uncle happened to be the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Malachia Ormanian. Her parents died while she was still young: her mother Akabi, when she was nine, and her father Mihran, when she was eighteen. She graduated from Yesayan Parochial School and the English High School in Constantinople, gaining fluency in Armenian, English and French at an early age. In 1915, during the height of the Armenian Genocide, Der Nersessian and her sister Arax (by then orphans) were forced to leave for Europe, where they took up residence in Geneva. Der Nersessian studied at the University of Geneva for several years until settling in Paris, France in 1919.\n\nDer Nersessian was admitted to Sorbonne University, studying history at the École des Hautes Études de l'université de Paris. She studied under the notable Byzantinologists Charles Diehl and Gabriel Millet and art historian Henri Focillon. In 1922, she became Millet's assistant, and with his help, published one of her first articles in 1929. The two theses (graduates students then had to submit two theses) that she presented for her \"doctorat d'etat\", \"L'illustration du roman de Barlaam et Joasaph\" and a paper on Armenian illuminated manuscripts during the late medieval period, were well-received (earning a \"Mention très honorable\"), and both of them were awarded with prizes by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and \"Revue des Études Grecques\" when they were published in 1937.\n\nIn 1930, Der Nersessian moved to the United States at the suggestion of her three mentors, Byzantinists Charles Rufus Morey, Albert M. Friend Jr., and Walter Cook, becoming a part-time lecturer at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. She taught art history at Wellesley, quickly gaining a full professorship and later becoming the chairwoman of the Department of Art History and Director of Farnsworth Museum. Der Nersessian was the first woman to teach Byzantine art at a woman’s college, the first woman to be decorated with the medal of Saint Gregory the Illuminator by His Holiness Catholicos Vazgen I in 1960, the first woman invited to lecture at the Collège de France in Paris, the only woman in her time to gain full professorship at Dumbarton Oaks, and the second woman to be honored with a gold medal from the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1970. In 1947, she received the Achievement Award from the American Association of University Women.\n\nDer Nersessian remained at Dumbarton Oaks until 1978, when she retired to France and lived with her sister in Paris. Upon retirement, she had her entire library shipped to the Matenadaran in Yerevan, so as to better help Armenian scholars in their studies. Shortly after her death in 1989, an endowment fund for prospective art history students in Armenia, Fonds Sirarpie Der Neressian at the Institut de Recherches sur les Miniatures Arméno-Byzantines, was created in her honor.\n\nDer Nersessian's work primarily concerned Armenian art history, including the study of church architecture, illuminated manuscripts, miniatures and sculpture. Below is a partial list of books and articles that she authored. Her 1945 book, \"Armenia and the Byzantine Empire\", was praised by art historians David Talbot Rice, Jurgis Baltrušaitis, and Alexander Vasiliev. Vasiliev wrote in his review of the book that she is \"the best authority of our day on Armenian history, art, and civilization.\"\n\n\n"}

His scholarly work was directed to the study of runic inscriptions and Norse philology. Bugge is best known for his theories and his work on the runic alphabet and the \"Poetic Edda\" and \"Prose Edda\".\n\nElseus Sophus Bugge was born in Larvik, in Vestfold county, Norway. His ancestors had been merchants, ship owners and captains of the Larvik for several generations. Bugge was a cand.mag. (1857) and research fellow in comparative linguistics and Sanskrit (1860). He was educated in Christiania, Copenhagen and Berlin.\n\nIn 1866 he became professor of comparative philology, comparative Indo-European linguistics and Old Norse at Christiania University now the University of Oslo. In addition to collecting Norwegian folksongs and traditions and writing on Runic inscriptions, he made considerable contributions to the study of the Celtic, Romance, Oscan, Umbrian and Etruscan languages. His scientific work was of fundamental importance for the Norse philology and runic research.\n\nIn his 1880 work \"Studies about the origin of Nordic mythological and heroic tales\", Bugge theorized that nearly all myths in Old Norse literature derive from Christian and late classical concepts. Bugge's theories were generally vehemently rejected, but have had some influence.\n\nBugge was the author of a very large number of books on philology and folklore. His principal work, a critical edition of the Poetic Edda (\"Norrœn Fornkvæði\"), was published at Christiania in 1867. He maintained that the Eddic poems and the earlier sagas were largely founded on Christian and Latin tradition imported into Scandinavian literature by way of England. His writings also include \"Gamle Norske Folkeviser\" (1858), a collection of Old Norse folk-songs; \"Bidrag til den ældste skaldedigtnings historie\" (Christiania, 1894); \"Helge-digtene i den Ældre Edda\" (Copenhagen, 1896, Eng. trans., \"The Home of the Eddic Poems\", 1899); \"Norsk Sagafortælling og Sagaskrivning i Island\" (Christiania, 1901), and various books on runic inscriptions.\n\nDating from 1902, Bugge's vision was so poor that he could no longer read. Professor and linguist Magnus Olsen, who was Bugge's assistant and his successor, would read and describe new discoveries of inscriptions. Bugge's final works regarding original rune scripture were not completed before he died. They were released between 1910 and 1913 through the efforts of Professor Olsen.\n\nBugge was a member of the Scientific Society of Christiania (now The Norwegian Academy of Science) from 1858 (vice president 1884), The Royal Norwegian Scientific Society in Trondheim (1865) and a number of foreign societies. He was made honorary doctor at Uppsala University in 1877. He was appointed a Knight of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1877, Commander Grand Cross 1890 and 1896.\n\nBugge was married during 1869 to Karen Sophie Schreiner (1835–1897). His son Alexander Bugge became a noted historian.\n\n"}

{"id": "694264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=694264", "title": "Tom Horn", "text": "Tom Horn\n\nThomas Horn Jr. (November 21, 1860 – November 20, 1903) was an American scout, cowboy, soldier, range detective, and Pinkerton agent in the 19th-century American Old West. Believed to have committed 17 killings as a hired gunman throughout the West, Horn was convicted in 1902 of the murder of 14-year-old Willie Nickell near Iron Mountain, Wyoming. Willie was the son of sheep rancher Kels Nickell, who had been involved in a range feud with neighbor and cattle rancher Jim Miller. On the day before his 43rd birthday, Horn was executed by hanging in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nWhile in jail he wrote his autobiography, \"Life of Tom Horn: Government Scout and Interpreter\", which was published posthumously in 1904. Numerous editions have been published in the late 20th century. Horn has since become a larger-than-life figure of western folklore, and debate continues as to whether he was actually guilty of Nickell's murder.\n\nThomas Horn, Jr., known as \"Tom\", was born in 1860 to Thomas S. Horn, Sr. and Mary Ann Maricha (née Miller) on their family farm in rural northeastern Scotland County, Missouri. The family owned 600 acres bisected by the South Wyaconda River between the towns of Granger and Etna. Tom was the fifth of twelve children. During his childhood, the young Tom suffered physical abuse from his father, and his only companion as a child was a dog named Shedrick. The dog was tragically killed when the young Tom got into a fight with two boys, who beat Tom and killed the dog with a shotgun.\n\nHorn allegedly killed his first man in a duel — a second lieutenant in the Mexican Army, whom he killed as a result of a dispute with a prostitute. At sixteen, Horn headed to the American Southwest, where he was hired by the U.S. Cavalry as a civilian scout, packer and interpreter under Al Sieber during the Apache Wars. Horn did a great job in his work for the army, and soon rose through the ranks. In one instance, as the army was crossing Cibecue Creek, they were ambushed by Apaches warriors positioned on high ground. The officer in charge of their squad, Captain Edmund Hentig, was instantly killed, and the men became pinned down under overwhelming fire. Desperate, Sieber ordered Horn and another scout, Mickey Free, to break away and return fire from a hill. Together with the soldiers, the men managed to repel the attack. Horn and Sieber also participated in the Battle of Big Dry Wash, and gained recognition when he and Lt. George H. Morgan slipped through the banks opposite the Apache line and provided covering fire for the cavalry, as well as killing a number of Apache warriors.\n\nHorn was a respected scout by then, known for going out alone in reconnaissance missions as well as helping track down Geronimo's major stronghold. By November 1885, Tom Horn earned the position of Chief of Scouts under Captain Emmet Crawford in Fort Bowie. During one operation, Horn's camp was mistakenly attacked by a Mexican militia, and he was wounded in the arm during the shootout, which also resulted in Crawford's death. Finally, on September 4, 1886, Horn was present at Geronimo's final surrender and acted as an interpreter under Charles B. Gatewood.\n\nAfter the war, Horn used what he earned to build his own ranch in his return to Aravaipa Canyon in Arizona. His ranch consisted of 100 cattle and 26 horses, and he also laid claim in the Deer Creek Mining District near the canyon. Unfortunately, it was short-lived, as cattle thieves stormed his ranch one night and stole all his stock, leaving a tremendous loss and bankruptcy for Horn. This incident would mark Horn's hatred and disdain for thieves, which would lead to his entering the profession of range detective.\n\nHorn wandered and took jobs as a prospector, ranch hand and rodeo contestant, but he is most notorious for being hired by numerous cattle companies as a cowboy and hired gun to watch over their cattle and kill any suspected criminals preying on them. In his line of work, Horn developed his own means to fight cattle rustling, which he described: \"I would simply take the calf and such things as that stopped the stealing. I had more faith in getting the calf than in courts.\" If he thought a man was guilty of stealing cattle and had been fairly warned, Horn said that he would shoot the thief and would not feel \"one shred of remorse.\" Horn would often give a warning first to those he suspected of rustling, and was said to have been a \"tremendous presence\" whenever he was in the vicinity. Fergie Mitchell, a rancher on the North Laramie River, described Horn's reputation:\n\nI saw him ride by. He didn't stop, but went straight on up the creek in plain sight of everyone. All he wanted was to be seen, as his reputation was so great that his presence in a community had the desired effect. Within a week three settlers in the neighborhood sold their holdings and moved out. That was the end of cattle rustling on the North Laramie.\n\nLater, Horn took part in the Pleasant Valley War between cattlemen and sheepmen in Arizona. Historians have not established which side he worked for, and both sides suffered several killings for which no known suspects were ever identified. Horn worked on a ranch owned by Robert Bowen, where he became one of the prime suspects in the disappearance of Mart Blevins in 1887. He claimed that throughout the war, he was the \"mediator\" of the conflict, serving as a deputy sheriff under three famous Arizona lawmen: William Owen \"Buckey\" O'Neill, Commodore Perry Owens, and Glenn Reynolds. Horn also participated with Reynolds in a lynching of three suspected rustlers in August 1888. As a deputy sheriff, Horn drew the attention of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency due to his tracking abilities. Hired by the agency in late 1889 or early 1890, he handled investigations in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming and in other western states, working out of the Denver office. He became known for his calm under pressure and his ability to track down anyone assigned to him.\n\nIn one case, Horn and another agent, C.W. Shores, captured two men who had robbed the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad on August 31, 1890 between Cotopaxi and Texas Creek in Fremont County, Colorado. Horn and Shores tracked and arrested Thomas Eskridge (also known as \"Peg-Leg\" Watson) and Burt \"Red\" Curtis without firing a shot. They tracked them all the way to the home of a man named Wolfe, said to be in either Washita or Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, along the Washita River. In his report on that arrest, Horn stated in part \"Watson, was considered by everyone in Colorado as a very desperate character. I had no trouble with him.\"\n\nDuring the Johnson County War, Horn worked for the Wyoming Stock Growers Association as well as for the Pinkertons, who had assigned him to work undercover in the county using the alias Tom Hale. He is alleged to have been involved in the killing of Nate Champion and Nick Ray on April 9, 1892, and was a prime suspect for the assassinations of ranchers John A. Tisdale and Orley \"Ranger\" Jones. The Pinkerton Agency forced Horn to resign in 1894. In his memoir, \"Two Evil Isms: Pinkertonism and Anarchism\", Pinkerton detective Charlie Siringo wrote that \"William A. Pinkerton told me that Tom Horn was guilty of the crime, but that his people could not allow him to go to prison while in their employ.\" Siringo would later indicate that he respected Horn's abilities at tracking, and that he was a very talented agent, but had a wicked element.\n\nIn 1895, Horn reportedly killed a known cattle thief named William Lewis near Iron Mountain, Wyoming. Horn was exonerated for that crime and for the 1895 murder of Fred Powell six weeks later. In 1896, a ranchman named Campbell, known to have a large stash of cash, was last seen with Horn. In 1896, Horn offered his service in a letter to the marshal of Tucson, Arizona in getting rid of William Christian's rustler gang. William was killed by an unknown assailant in 1897, and his associate Robert Christian disappeared the same year.\n\nAlthough his official title was \"Range Detective\", Horn essentially served as a killer-for-hire. By the mid-1890s, the cattle business in Wyoming and Colorado was changing due to the arrival of homesteaders and new ranchers. The homesteaders, referred to as \"nesters\" or \"grangers\" by the big operators, had moved into the territory in large numbers. By doing so they decreased the availability of water for the herds of the larger cattle barons. Soon, efforts were made to get rid of these homesteaders, including by hiring gunmen such as Tom Horn. Violent gunfights such as the bloody shootout that resulted in the death of nine trappers in Big Dry Creek, as well as the lynching and burning of homesteaders Luther M. Mitchell and Ami W. Ketchum, precipitated the Colorado Range War.\n\nIn 1900, Horn began working for the Swan Land and Cattle Company in northwest Colorado. His first job was to investigate the Browns Park Cattle Association's leader, a cowboy named Matt Rash, who was suspected of cattle rustling. Horn went undercover as \"Tom Hicks\" and worked for Rash as a ranch hand while also collecting evidence of Rash branding cattle that did not belong to him. When Horn finally pieced together enough evidence to determine that Rash was indeed a rustler, he put a letter on Rash's door threatening that he must leave in sixty days. Rash, however, defiantly stayed and continued working on his ranch. As Rash continued to be uncooperative, Horn's employers were said to have given him the \"go-ahead signal\" to execute Rash. On the day of the murder, an armed Horn allegedly arrived at Rash's cabin as the man had just finished eating and shot him at point-blank range. The dying Rash unsuccessfully tried to write the name of his killer, but no trace was left of the murder. Only the accounts and rumors from various people point to Horn as the one responsible. Rash was supposed to be married to a nearby rancher, Ann Bassett, and the woman accused \"Hicks\" of being the murderer.\n\nAround the same time, Horn also suspected another cowboy named Isom Dart of rustling. Dart was one of Rash's fellow cowboys, but was believed to have previously worked as a rustler named Ned Huddleston and a former member of the late \"Tip Gault\"'s gang. The gang, which had rustled cattle in the Saratoga area, had been wiped out in a gun battle. Dart also had three indictments returned against him in Sweetwater County. When Dart was accused of murdering Rash, he took refuge inside his friend's cabin and waited for the rumors to cool down. Horn, however, managed to track Dart to his cabin and saw him hiding together with two other armed associates. The assassin was said to have set up a sniping position under the cover of a pine tree, overlooking the cabin from a hill. As Dart and his friends came out of the cabin, Horn shot him in the chest from a distance. Prior to the assassination, Horn had instructed a rancher named Robert Hudler to ready a horse miles from the murder scene for his getaway. The next day, two spent .30-30 Winchester casings were found at the base of a tree where it was believed the murderer had laid in wait. \"Hicks\" was said to have been the only one in the area to use a .30-30. The news of Rash and Dart's deaths spread throughout the territory, and as such the other rustlers scattered in fear. Horn tracked them all down and killed three other members of Rash's association. The story goes that he pinned one of the dead cowboy's ears for the homesteaders to see as a warning.\n\nDuring the Wilcox train robbery investigation, Horn obtained information from Bill Speck that revealed which of the robbers had killed Sheriff Josiah Hazen during their escape. Either George Curry or Harvey \"Kid Curry\" Logan were said to have killed the sheriff. Both outlaws were members of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang, then known as \"The Hole-in-the-Wall Gang\" after their hideaway in the mountains. Horn passed this information on to Charlie Siringo, who was working the case for the Pinkertons.\n\nHorn briefly entered the United States Army to serve during the Spanish–American War as the chief packer of the Fifth Corps. He left Tampa for Cuba, where he led some of the pack trains to the front. Horn personally witnessed the bravery of the famous Rough Riders and colored regiments, the Ninth and Tenth Cavalries, during their assault on San Juan Hill, as well as the humiliating rout of American soldiers under Brig. Gen. Hamilton Hawkins. Although the packers were non-combatants, they were still prone to attack by Cuban rebels. Horn considered himself lucky to have lost no tracker during the war, although Horn recalled that he and his men were under constant fire as they delivered rations and ammunition to the soldiers. Horn continued working as a packer during the war even though he and many of his men contracted yellow fever. At one point he was bedridden and was deemed unfit for combat. Upon recovering, he returned to Wyoming. Shortly after his return, Horn began working for wealthy cattle baron John C. Coble in 1901, who belonged to the Wyoming Stock Men's Association.\n\nWhile working again near Iron Mountain, Wyoming, Horn visited the Jim and Dora Miller family on July 15, 1901. They were cattle ranchers. (Jim Miller was no relation to the Texas outlaw Jim Miller.) Jim Miller and his neighbor Kels Nickell had already had several disputes following Nickell's introduction of sheep into the Iron Mountain area. Miller frequently accused Nickell of letting his sheep graze on Miller's land.\n\nAt the Millers, Horn met Glendolene M. Kimmell, the young teacher at the Iron Mountain School. Ms. Kimmell was supported by both the large Miller and Kels Nickell families, and she boarded with the Millers. Horn entertained her with accounts of his adventures. That day he and males of the Miller family went fishing; he and Victor Miller, a son about his age, also practiced shooting, both of them with .30-30s.\n\nThe Miller and Nickell families were the only ones to have children at the school. Kimmell had been advised of the families' ongoing feud before she arrived, and found that it was often played out by conflict among the children. A few days later, on July 18, 1901, Willie Nickell, the 14-year-old son of sheep ranchers Kels and Mary Nickell, was found murdered near their homestead gate. A coroner's inquest began to investigate the murder. More violent incidents occurred during the period of the coroner's inquest, which was expanded to investigate these incidents, and lasted from July through September 1901.\n\nOn August 4, 1901, Kels Nickell was shot and wounded. Some 60–80 of his sheep were found \"shot or clubbed to death.\" Two of the younger Nickell children later reported seeing two men leaving on horses colored a bay and a gray, as were horses owned by Jim Miller. On August 6, 1901, Deputy Sheriff Peter Warlaumont and Deputy U.S. Marshal Joe LeFors came to Iron Mountain and arrested Jim Miller and his sons Victor and Gus on suspicion of shooting Kels Nickell. They were jailed on August 7 and released the following day on bond. The investigation of the shooting of Kels Nickell was added to the investigation of Willie Nickell's murder in the coroner's inquest.\n\nDeputy Marshal Joe Lefors later questioned Horn in January 1902 about the murder, while supposedly talking to him about employment. Horn was still inebriated from the night before, but Lefors gained what he called a confession to the murder of Willie Nickell. Horn allegedly confessed to killing the young Willie with his rifle from 300 yards, which he boasted as the \"best shot that [he] ever made and the dirtiest trick that [he] ever done.\" Horn was arrested the next day by the county sheriff. Walter Stoll was the Laramie County Prosecutor in the case. Judge Richard H. Scott, who presided over the case, was running for re-election.\n\nHorn was supported by his longtime friend and employer, cattle rancher John C. Coble. He gathered a team for the defense headed by former Judge John W. Lacey and which included attorneys T.F. Burke, Roderick N. Matson, Edward T. Clark and T. Blake Kennedy. Reportedly, Coble paid for most of the costs of this large team. According to Johan P. Bakker, who wrote \"Tracking Tom Horn\", the large cattle interests by this time found Horn \"expendable\" and the case provided a way to silence him in regard to their activities. He wrote that 100 members of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association paid $1000 each toward the defense, but wanted a minimal effort.\n\nHorn's trial started October 10, 1902 in Cheyenne, which filled with crowds attracted by the notoriety of Horn. \"The Rocky Mountain News\" noted the carnival atmosphere and great interest from the public for a conviction. The prosecution introduced Horn's confession to Lefors. Only certain parts of Horn's statement were introduced, distorting his statement. The prosecution introduced testimony by at least two witnesses, including Lefors, as well as circumstantial evidence; these elements only placed Horn in the general vicinity of the crime scene. During the trial, Victor Miller testified that he and Horn both had .30-30 guns and bought their ammunition at the same store. Another, Otto Plaga, testified that Horn was 20 miles from the scene of the murder an hour after it was committed.\n\nGlendolene Kimmell had testified during the coroner's inquest, saying she thought both the Miller and Nickell families responsible for maintaining the feud, but she was never called as a defense witness. She had resigned from the school in October 1901 and left the area, but was in communication with people in the case.\n\nHorn's trial went to the jury on October 23, and they returned a guilty verdict the next day. A hearing several days later sentenced Horn to death by hanging. Horn's attorneys filed a petition with the Wyoming Supreme Court for a new trial. While in jail, Horn wrote his autobiography, \"Life of Tom Horn, Government Scout and Interpreter, Written by Himself\", mostly giving an account of his early life. It contained little about the case.\n\nThe Wyoming Supreme Court upheld the decision of the District Court and denied a new trial. Convinced of Horn's innocence, Glendolene Kimmell sent an affidavit to Governor Fenimore Chatterton with testimony reportedly saying that Victor Miller was guilty of Nickell's murder. Accounts of its contents appeared in the press, but the original document has since disappeared. The governor chose not to intervene in the case. Horn was initially given an execution date of November 20, 1903.\n\nTom Horn was one of the few people in the \"Wild West\" to have been hanged by a water-powered gallows, known as the \"Julian Gallows.\" James P. Julian, a Cheyenne, Wyoming architect, designed the contraption in 1892. The trap door was connected to a lever which pulled the plug out of a barrel of water. This would cause a lever with a counterweight to rise, pulling on the support beam under the gallows. When enough pressure was applied, the beam broke free, opening the trap and hanging the condemned man.\n\nHorn was hanged in Cheyenne. At that time, Horn never gave up the names of those who had hired him during the feud. He was buried in the Columbia Cemetery in Boulder, Colorado on December 3, 1903. Rancher Jim Coble paid for his coffin and a stone to mark his grave. After his death, many considered Horn was wrongly executed for a murder solely based on a drunk confession. Even the old Apache warrior, Geronimo, expressed his doubts about Horn's charges during an interview with Charles Ackenhausen, saying that he \"did not believe [Horn] guilty.\"\n\nIt is still debated whether Horn was responsible for Nickell's murder. Historians including Chip Carlson believe he did not, while others such as Dean Fenton Krakel believe that he did, but had not realized he was shooting a boy. The consensus is that regardless of whether Horn committed that particular murder, he had certainly committed many others. Carlson, who extensively researched the \"Wyoming v. Tom Horn\" trial, concluded that although Horn \"could have\" committed the murder of Willie Nickell, he probably did not. According to Carlson's book, \"Tom Horn: Blood on the Moon\" (2001), there was no physical evidence that Horn had committed the murder. In addition, he was last seen in the area the day \"before\" it occurred, and the conditions of his alleged confession made it without value as evidence. Carlson believed the prosecution made no efforts to investigate other possible suspects, including Victor Miller. In essence, Horn's reputation and history made him an easy target for the prosecution.\n\nThe case was retried in a mock trial in 1993 in Cheyenne, and Horn was acquitted.\n\nIn 2014, the historian Larry Ball, professor emeritus at Arkansas State University in Jonesboro, Arkansas, published \"Tom Horn in Life and Legend\". Ball was fascinated by Horn's conflicting and enigmatic personality. Ball said that he is convinced that Horn shot and killed Willie Nickell near the Iron Mountain area: \"I have to fall back on the historical record.\" Ball said that he found no evidence of a legal conspiracy against Horn. He added that Horn's penchant for brutality contributed to his being convicted of the murder.\n\nAt a discussion of their findings that year, Chip Carlson of Cheyenne continued his support of Horn's innocence, saying: \"I maintain that Tom Horn was railroaded\" because Horn had been employed by cattle barons who were at odds with the homesteaders. Carlson also noted that the presiding judge at Horn's trial was a candidate for reelection at the time. Carlson described Horn in the trial as \"his own worst enemy. The more he talked, the tighter the noose\" became.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In Shakespeare's tragedy \"Othello\", the flaw in Othello himself is his vulnerability to jealousy and his tendency to believe Iago, who is manipulating Othello into believing his wife is unfaithful. As a result of this flaw Othello loses a loyal friend, murders his wife, and is driven insane before eventually committing suicide. In this scenario the Wheel of Fire begins with the action of Othello trusting Iago and consequently the other events occur.\n\nThe Wheel of Fire is most commonly applied to the protagonist within a tragedy (i.e. the hero) and may aim to provoke sympathy from the audience when the hero falls from grace (this purging of emotions is known as \"catharsis\"), though it also adds dramatic interest to the performance.\n\nThe Wheel of Fire is also the title of G. Wilson Knight's book on Shakespearean tragedy.\n\nIn Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", Lear states: \"But I am bound upon a wheel of fire, / That mine own tears do scald like molten lead\".\n\nIn J. R. R.

{"id": "24885165", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24885165", "title": "Women warriors in literature and culture", "text": "Women warriors in literature and culture\n\nThe portrayal of women warriors in literature and popular culture is a subject of study in history, literary studies, film studies, folklore history, and mythology. The archetypal figure of the woman warrior is an example of a normal thing that happens in some cultures, while also being a counter stereotype, opposing the normal construction of war, violence and aggression as masculine. This convention-defying position makes the female warrior a prominent site of investigation for discourses surrounding female power and gender roles in society.\n\nIn Hindu mythology, Chitrāngadā, wife of Arjuna, was the commander of her father's armies.\n\nThe Amazons were an entire tribe of woman warriors in Greek legend. \"Amazon\" has become an eponym for woman warriors and athletes in both modern and ancient society.\n\nIn British mythology, Queen Cordelia fought off several contenders for her throne by personally leading the army in its battles as well as defending her home from her own warring family members, until she eventually commits suicide due to grief. Another example in ancient British history is Queen Boudica, who lead a rebellion against the Roman Empire.\n\nIn his \"On the Bravery of Women\" the Greco-Roman historian Plutarch describes how the women of Argos fought against King Cleomenes and the Spartans under the command of Telesilla in the fifth century BCE.\n\nLiterary women warriors include \"Gordafarid\" (Persian: گردآفريد) in the ancient Persian epic poem The Shāhnāmeh, Delhemma in Arabic epic literature, Mulan, Camilla in the \"Aeneid\", Belphoebe and Britomart in Edmund Spenser's \"The Faerie Queene\", Bradamante and Marfisa in \"Orlando Furioso\", Clorinda and (reluctantly) Erminia in \"La Gerusalemme liberata\", and Grendel's mother.\n\nThe woman warrior is part of a long tradition in many different cultures including Chinese and Japanese martial arts films, but their reach and appeal to Western audiences is possibly much more recent, coinciding with the greatly increased number of female heroes in American media since 1990.\n\nWomen warriors have been taken up as a symbol for feminist empowerment, emphasizing women's agency and capacity for power instead of the common pattern of female victim-hood. Professor Sherrie Inness in \"Tough Girls: Women Warriors and Wonder Women in Popular Culture\" and Frances Early and Kathleen Kennedy in \"Athena's Daughters: Television's New Women Warriors\", for example, focus on figures such as Xena, from the television series \"\" or Buffy Summers from \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". In the introduction to their text, Early and Kennedy discuss what they describe as a link between the image of women warriors and girl power. \n\nAlthough there is a distinction between positive aggression and violence, fictional representations of female violence like \"Kill Bill\" still have the power to function positively, equipping women for real-life situations that require outward aggression. Beyond the individual level, fictional depictions of violence by women can be a political tool to draw attention to real-world issues of violence, such as the ongoing violence against Indigenous women. Others say that a violent heroine undermines the feminist ethics against male violence, even when she is posited as a defender of women, for example in films such as \"Hard Candy\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The records for the first three films have since been surpassed. The next three \"X-Men\" films after \"X-Men: The Last Stand\" opened lower than their predecessor and didn't set opening records.

Realism at this time of year? How unorthodox!\" Roger Ebert gave the films mostly positive reviews, but criticized them for the amount of mutants, stating \"their powers are so various and ill-matched that it's hard to keep them all on the same canvas.\"\n\nThe first two films were highly praised due to their cerebral tone. However, when director Bryan Singer left the series, many criticized his successor, Brett Ratner. Colin Colvert of the \"Star Tribune\" felt \"Singer's sensitivity to [the discrimination themes] made the first two \"X-Men\" films surprisingly resonant and soulful for comic-based summer extravaganzas ... Singer is adept at juggling large casts of three-dimensional characters, Ratner makes shallow, unimaginative bang-ups.\" James Berardinelli felt, \"\"X-Men: The Last Stand\" isn't as taut or satisfying as \"X-Men 2\", but it's better constructed and better paced than the original \"X-Men\". The differences in quality between the three are minor, however; despite the change in directors, there seems to be a single vision.\" David Denby of \"The New Yorker\" praised \"the liquid beauty and the poetic fantasy of Singer's work\", but called Ratner's film \"a crude synthesizer of comedy and action tropes.\" Singer's third film in the series, \"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" was also well received. Alonso Duralde of \"The Wrap\" felt that \"Singer keeps things moving along briskly enough that you can just go along with the ride of Superhero Stuff without getting bogged down\". \"Spider-Man\" director Sam Raimi said he was a fan of the series, particularly Singer's films. Film historian Kim Newman also tonally compared \"Batman Begins\" to Singer's films. \"Logan\" received a nomination from Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nThere was criticism of the large cast, and the limited screentime for all of them. Richard George of IGN reacted well to the depictions of Wolverine, Professor X, Magneto, Jean Grey, Storm, William Stryker, Mystique, Beast and Nightcrawler; however, George thought many of the younger X-Men characters, such as Rogue, Iceman, Pyro, Angel and Kitty Pryde were \"adjectiveless teenager[s]\", and was disappointed by Cyclops' characterization. He observed the filmmakers were \"big fans of silent henchmen\", due to the small roles of the various villainous mutants; such as Lady Deathstrike and Psylocke. While Jesse Schedeen of IGN, stated that the continuity of the films doesn't make sense with dead characters returning with zero or little explanation, different versions of the same character appearing across multiple films and plot points that are conveniently ignored in later films. He also criticized 20th Century Fox for not mapping out the series from the beginning.\n\nRichard George of IGN stated that the success of the first \"X-Men\" film paved the way for comic-book film adaptations such as the \"Spider-Man\" series, \"Fantastic Four\" (2005), \"V for Vendetta\" and Singer's \"Superman Returns\". Chris Hewitt of \"Empire\" magazine called the first \"X-Men\" film as the \"catalyst\" for films based on Marvel Comics characters, stating \"Singer's 2000 film is the catalyst for everything that's come since, good and bad. Without it, there's no Marvel Studios.\" Comic-book writer Mark Millar said that Singer's \"X-Men\" \"revolutionized\" superhero films. Rebecca Rubin of \"Variety\" magazine stated that the X-Men franchise has proven there's an audience for a hardline superhero film. While Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations said that with films like the Deadpool films and \"Logan\", that studios can do more with an R-rated film, and give the audience something new.\n\n20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the first ten films on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download.
