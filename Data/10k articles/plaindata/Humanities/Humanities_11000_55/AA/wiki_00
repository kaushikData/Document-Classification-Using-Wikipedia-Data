{"id": "24189366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24189366", "title": "A Failure of Capitalism", "text": "A Failure of Capitalism\n\nA Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression is a non-fiction book by the economist Richard Posner. The text was initially published on May 1, 2009 by Harvard University Press. Posner criticizes President George W. Bush and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis, and moves away from his past well-known advocacy of free-market capitalism. The book has been primarily noted not for his criticism of progressive government policies (which he attacks again for good measure), but rather his critique of laissez-faire capitalism and its ideologues.\n\nThe book has been received with generally good reviews from the press, including \"The New York Times\", but the reception has not been universally positive.\n\nThe primary argument of the book is that we have gone from a recession into a depression (the \"D\" word, as one author calls it) in 2009, and Posner suggests several possible short-term and long-term solutions to this fiscal crisis. His thesis is not that government, politicians, or even bankers primarily caused this depression, but rather that the capitalist system is to blame for its own faults.\n\nSome of the causes of the depression that Posner cites are the lack of enforceable usury laws, which would discourage risky loans, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and central banks taking risks, securitization of mortgages, illiquidity and insolvency of the banking system, the housing bubble, blindness to warning signs of a crisis, and the preconceptions of ideology.\n\nPosner wraps up the book with a chapter containing several suggestions, including eventual re-regulation of the banking industry, but warns that \"this is not the time\" to do so — a long-term solution after the economy recovers — that can \"wait calmer days.\" He also suggests putting off reorganization of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve until a later time. In the meanwhile, he writes, \"piecemeal reforms may be feasible and helpful.\" These include a halt on government marketing of home ownership, requiring banks and financial institutions to \"disclose the \"full\" compensation of all senior executives\", backloading of compensation, increasing marginal income tax rates on the highest incomes, and usury laws to discourage risky loans.\n\nThe book is significant in Posner's criticism of President George W. Bush and his administration's policies and the response to the fiscal crisis. Part of the shock is due to Posner's longtime \"conservative\" views. Judge Posner was nominated to the Seventh Circuit by Ronald Reagan, but is \"no party man.\"\n\nPosner starts his criticism of Bush with a broad attack on his behavior in his final months as President:\nPosner blames Bush for pushing policies, such as the \"ownership society\", a $10 trillion national debt and \"the huge budget deficits run by the Bush administration\", \"prop[ping] up stock prices by keeping interest rates low,\" which were underlying causes of the crisis, as well as \"Dithering\" in late 2008. By the \"ownership society\", Posner referred to the American Dream Down Payment Act of 2003 and other laws that made ownership easier.\n\nPosner points out that Bush's proposed privatization of Social Security would have made the depression even more harmful. Posner states that one of the \"lessons learned\" is that the \"blurred\" line between \"the government and the private sector ... in the Bush Administration\" contributed to a lack of insight into the underlying problems. Even more so, \"the emphatically pro-business philosophy of the Bush administration made the SEC too trusting of the securities industry.\" The bottom line is that \"there might not have been a depression had it not been for the Bush administration's mismanagement of the economy.\"\n\nPosner, famous for his advocacy of free markets, turns on free-market capitalism in this book: \"the financial crisis is indeed a crisis of capitalism rather than a failure of government.\" Posner explicitly states that he has changed his mind, that in the words of economist Robert Lucas, \"that macroeconomics in this original sense has succeeded.\" Posner states that:\nPosner points out that one of the causes of the depression was \"blindness to warning signs\" of a crisis. A few people had warned of problems, including Nouriel Roubini, and Brooksley Born, but they were ignored. He asserts that the \"depression is a failure of capitalism\".\n\nThis is the second and most powerful shock. The \"New York Times\" points out that:\nPosner also assigns part of the blame for the recession on the administration of Bill Clinton. He says they were to blame for pushing policies that created the housing bubble. The training and experience of several Clinton advisors, notably Robert Rubin, were tilted towards Wall Street, which he found to be ultimately dangerous. Likewise, Alan Greenspan, Clinton's appointee as chairman of the Federal Reserve, gets a special blame for pushing low interest rates, which increased stock prices and led, in turn, to the bubbles in banking, stocks, and housing.\n\nPosner sweeps a wide swath in assigning portions of blame for causing the underlying recession on a variety of factors and persons. He praises the use of specific deterrence in shaming debtors, which, in his mind, has not been used enough recently. He faults the concept of limited liability for increasing risk. He points out the harmful focus on short-term profits at the expenses of long-term stability. Bad credit was, in Posner's words, given a \"so what?\" attitude.\n\nClinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress encouraged home ownership by people who had bad credit and should have, in Posner's view, remained tenants. Competition in the banking industry led to deregulation in Clinton's administration, and enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which increased risk to the system. Posner is not alone in criticizing the \"Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act\"; some economists, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz also believe it helped create the 2007 financial crisis. Encouraging the practice of \"sweeps\" by large investors (removing money from demand deposits into money market funds overnight) exacerbated the problem.\n\nPreconceptions and ideology held by both sides of the spectrum, argues the book, prevented novel challenges to changing fiscal realities. Macroeconomics has not made use of chaos theory, and thus says Posner, the \"signal-noise ratio\" prevented a clear analysis and even created \"blindness\" and \"misinformation\" for policy analysts.\n\nPosner went on the record against \"how\" Barack Obama's administration's Keynesian stimulus in the ARRA \"could have been better designed,\" and specifically demurs against some of Obama's statements:\nNonetheless, Posner points out that what is rational for an individual corporation may not be rational for the industry as a whole.\n\nReviewing for \"The New York Times\", Jonathan Rauch wrote that:\nThe \"Huffington Post\" gave a long review, noting with a bit of \"schadenfreude\" that Posner had changed his views. Michael Casey, in a review published in the \"Irish Times\", writes \"Blaming the system is a cop-out... Posner’s approach is far too deterministic\", and further calls the book \"[a]n incomplete analysis of a floundering social system.\"\n\nIn the \"Washington Post\", Paul M. Barrett, an assistant managing editor of \"Business Week\", writes that Posner seems to spread the blame too much, denigrates mere stupidity and \"greed\" as causes, and lacks \"constructive proposals for reform...\" Barrett points out how notable this book is, which is that \"his critique is bracing, all the more so because it comes from a right-leaning thinker normally hostile to the ministrations of government bureaucrats.\"\n\nThe \"New York Review of Books\" said that \"it is at best a partial success; it gets some things right and some things wrong, and the items on both sides of the ledger are important.\" In the \"Review\", Nobel Prize–winning economist Robert Solow praises the author quite faintly:\n\nSolow's review itself was notable to some degree, according to Brad DeLong, who critiqued Posner's logic along the way:\n\nIn an interview with \"The Economist\", Posner was forced to defend his use of the term \"depression\" and his move \"to the centre...\"\n\n\"Forbes\" magazine printed the preface of the book as a measure of its importance.\n\nIn January 2010, \"The New Yorker\" revisited \"A Failure of Capitalism\", noting that by September 2009, Posner had become a confirmed Keynesian: \"As acts of betrayal go, this was roughly akin to Johnny Damon's shaving off his beard, forsaking the Red Sox Nation, and joining the Yankees.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27700571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27700571", "title": "Abstraction (linguistics)", "text": "Abstraction (linguistics)\n\nThe term abstraction has a number of uses in the field of linguistics. It can denote a process (also called object abstraction) in the development of language, whereby terms become used for concepts further removed from the objects to which they were originally attached. It can also denote a process applied by linguists themselves, whereby phenomena are considered without the details that are not relevant to the desired level of analysis.\n\nObject abstraction, or simply \"abstraction\", is a concept wherein terms for objects become used for more abstract concepts, which in some languages develop into further abstractions such as verbs and grammatical words (grammaticalisation). \nAbstraction is common in human language, though it manifests in different ways for different languages. In language acquisition, children typically learn object words first, and then develop from that vocabulary an understanding of the alternate uses of such words.\n\nFor example, the word \"book\" refers objectively to a physical object constructed with bound pages, but in abstraction refers to a particular literary creation —regardless of how many physical copies of the \"book\" there are, it is one \"book.\" The word \"book\" then developed more abstract uses, such as in keeping a record (bookkeeping), or to keep a record of betting (booking), or as a verb for entering persons into a record (\"to book\"). Words may then be further abstracted and even have embedded puns, such as in 'to make history of oneself' (\"he booked\").\n\nAn early example of this kind of study came from John Horne Tooke, who in his conversational \"The Diversions of Purley\" (1786), proposed that the abstract word through came to English through both sound change and derivation from the Gothic:\nTooke was incorrect about \"through,\" but his insights about the way words migrated via geography, language, sound change, and meaning were innovative, and fundamentally correct.\n\nThe relation among syntax, semantics, and pragmatics has also been cashed out in terms of what could be called an \"abstraction hierarchy.\" For instance, Rudolf Carnap in his \"Introduction to Semantics\" (1942, Harvard University Press) writes:\n\nIf… explicit reference is made to the speaker, or, to put it in more general terms, to the user of a language, then we assign it to the field of pragmatics. (Whether in this case reference to designata is made or not makes no difference for this classification.) If we abstract from the user of the language and analyze only the expressions and their designata, we are in the field of semantics. And if, finally, we abstract from the designata also and analyze only the relations between the expressions, we are in (logical) syntax. The whole science of language, consisting of the three parts mentioned, is called semiotic. (p. 9)\n\nA related statement was made a few years earlier by Carnap's fellow American philosopher Charles W. Morris, PhD student of the sociologist and pragmatist philosopher George Herbert Mead, and heavily influenced by the pragmatist and founder of (analytical) semiotics, Charles Sanders Peirce: \n\"Syntactics, as the study of the syntactical relations of signs to one another in abstraction from the relations of signs to objects [i.e., semantics] or to interpreters [i.e., pragmatics], is the best developed of all the branches of semiotic.\" (p. 13)\nThe relation between abstraction and Morris' influential trichotomy is a matter of ongoing discussion.\n\nA kind of abstraction commonly considered in linguistics is the \"phoneme\", which abstracts speech sounds in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning. Other analogous kinds of abstractions (sometimes called \"emic units\") include morphemes, graphemes and lexemes.\n"}
{"id": "684336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=684336", "title": "Amelia Edwards", "text": "Amelia Edwards\n\nAmelia Ann Blanford Edwards (7 June 1831 – 15 April 1892), also known as Amelia B. Edwards, was an English novelist, journalist, traveller and Egyptologist. Her most successful literary works included the ghost story \"The Phantom Coach\" (1864), the novels \"Barbara's History\" (1864) and \"Lord Brackenbury\" (1880), and the Egyptian travelogue \"A Thousand Miles up the Nile\" (1877). In 1882, she co-founded the Egypt Exploration Fund. She also edited a poetry anthology published in 1878. Her address in London was 19 Wharton Street, Islington.\n\nBorn in London to an Irish mother and a father who had been a British Army officer before becoming a banker, Edwards was educated at home by her mother and showed early promise as a writer. She published her first poem at the age of seven and her first story at the age of twelve. Thereafter came a variety of poetry, stories, and articles in several periodicals, including \"Chambers's Journal\", \"Household Words\", and \"All the Year Round\". She also wrote for the \"Saturday Review\" and the \"Morning Post\".\n\nIn addition, Edwards became an artist and would illustrate some of her own writings. She would also paint scenes from other books she had read. She was talented enough at the age of 12 to catch the eye of George Cruikshank, who went as far to offer to teach her, but this talent was not supported by Edwards's parents, who saw it as a lesser profession and the artist way of life as scandalous. This negative decision haunted Edwards through her early life. She would wonder frequently whether art would not have been her true calling.\n\nThirdly, Edwards took up composing and performing music for some years, until she suffered a bout of Typhus in 1849 that was followed by a frequently sore throat, which made it hard for her to sing, caused her to lose interest in music and even regret the time she had spent on opera. Other interests she pursued included pistol shooting, riding, and mathematics.\n\nEarly in the 1850s, Edwards began to focus more exclusively on being a writer. Her first full-length novel was \"My Brother's Wife\" (1855). Her early novels were well received, but it was \"Barbara's History\" (1864), a novel involving bigamy, that established her reputation as a novelist. She spent much time and effort on the settings and backgrounds of her books, estimating that it took her about two years to complete the research and writing of each. This paid off when her last novel, \"Lord Brackenbury\" (1880), became a runaway success that went to 15 editions.\n\nEdwards wrote several ghost stories, including the frequently anthologised \"The Phantom Coach\" (1864). The background and characters in many of Edwards's writings are influenced by her own experiences. For example, \"Barbara's History\" (1864) uses Suffolk as the background, which she had visited for a few enjoyable summer holidays as a child.\n\nEdwards first heard about the Dolomites in 1853, through sketches which had been brought back to England from Italy. On 27 June 1872, she embarked on a trip through the mountains with her friend Lucy Renshawe. That day they left Monte Generoso for Venice, one of the three known ways to enter the Dolomites, but not before they had parted from Renshawe's maid and courtier, who disapproved such a journey. Instead the two women hired mountain guides from the region. On 1 July 1872, after a three-day stay in Venice, Edwards and Renshawe left for Longarone, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Pieve di Cadore, Auronzo di Cadore, Val Buona, Caprile, Agordo, Primiero, Predazzo, Fassa Valley, Passo Fedaia, Sasso Bianco, Forno di Zoldo, Zoppè di Cadore and Caprile, and ended their journey in Bolzano. At the time of Edwards's visit, the Dolomites were described as being terra incognita, and even educated persons had never heard of them. This journey was described in her book \"A Midsummer Ramble in the Dolomites (1873),\" later renamed \"Untrodden Peaks and Infrequent Valleys (1873)\". During the expedition, Edwards also searched for the works of Titian, finding a Madonna and Child in Serravalle (Vittorio Veneto) and two other paintings at a village church in Cadore. After her descent from the mountains, Edwards described civilized life as a \"dead-level World of Commonplace\".\n\nIn the summer of 1873, dissatisfied by the end of their journey, Edwards and Renshawe took to a walking tour of France. However, this was interrupted by torrential rains, a factor that influenced them in looking towards Egypt.\n\nEdwards, accompanied by several friends, toured Egypt in the winter of 1873–1874, discovering a fascination with the land and its cultures, ancient and modern. Journeying southwards from Cairo in a hired dahabiyeh (manned houseboat), the party visited Philae and ultimately reached Abu Simbel, where they remained for six weeks. Renshawe remained among her travelling companions. Another party member was the English painter Andrew McCallum, who discovered an unknown sanctuary that came to bear his name for some time afterwards. Their boat joined in a flotilla with another female English traveller, Marianne Brocklehurst, also travelling with a female companion. Brocklehurst and Edwards remained friends and Brocklehurst later supported her Egypt Exploration fund. \n\nEdwards wrote a vivid description of her Nile voyage entitled \"A Thousand Miles up the Nile\" (1877). Enhanced with her own illustrations, this travelogue was an immediate best-seller.\n\nEdwards' travels in Egypt made her aware of increasing threats to ancient monuments from tourism and modern development. She set out to hinder these through public awareness and scientific endeavour, becoming a tireless advocate for research and preservation of them. In 1882, she co-founded the Egypt Exploration Fund with Reginald Stuart Poole, Curator of the Department of Coins and Medals at the British Museum. Edwards became joint Honorary Secretary of the Fund until her death.\n\nTo advance the Fund's work, Edwards largely abandoned other writing in favour of Egyptology. She contributed to the ninth edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", to the American supplement of that work, and to the \"Standard Dictionary\". In addition, Edwards embarked on an strenuous lecture tour in the United States in 1889–1890. These lectures were later published as \"Pharaohs, Fellahs and Explorers\".\n\nAfter catching influenza, Edwards died on 15 April 1892 at Weston-super-Mare, having lived at Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol since 1864. She was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Henbury, Bristol, where her grave is marked by an obelisk, with a stone ankh at the foot. Alongside is the graves of her companion, Ellen Drew Braysher (9 April 1804 – 9 January 1892), with whom she had lived in Westbury-on-Trym, and of Ellen's daughter, Sarah Harriet Braysher (1832–1864). In September 2016, Historic England designated the grave as Grade II listed, celebrating it as a landmark in English LGBT history.\n\nEdwards bequeathed her collection of Egyptian antiquities and her library to University College London, together with a sum of £2,500 to found an Edwards Chair of Egyptology. Edwards was also a benefactor of Somerville College Library, having left many books, papers and watercolours to Somerville College, Oxford, along with a small collection of Greek and Roman pots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome dates and titles have been added from the catalogue of the British Library.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5992961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5992961", "title": "American civil religion", "text": "American civil religion\n\nAmerican civil religion is a sociological theory that a nonsectarian quasi-religious faith exists within the United States with sacred symbols drawn from national history. Scholars have portrayed it as a cohesive force, a common set of values that foster social and cultural integration. The very heavy emphasis on nondenominational religious themes is quite distinctively American and the theory is designed to explain this. The concept goes back to the 19th century, but in current form, the theory was developed by sociologist Robert Bellah in 1967 in his article, \"Civil Religion in America\". The topic soon became the major focus at religious sociology conferences and numerous articles and books were written on the subject. The debate reached its peak with the American Bicentennial celebration in 1976. There is a viewpoint that some Americans have come to see the document of the United States Constitution, along with the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights as cornerstones of a type of civic or civil religion or political religion. Political sociologist Anthony Squiers argues that these texts act as the sacred writ of the American civil religion because they are used as authoritative symbols in what he calls the politics of the sacred. The Politics of the Sacred, according to Squiers are \"the attempt to define and dictate what is in accord with the civil religious sacred and what is not. It is a battle to define what can and cannot be and what should and should not be tolerated and accepted in the community, based on its relation to that which is sacred for that community.\"\n\nAccording to Bellah, Americans embrace a common \"civil religion\" with certain fundamental beliefs, values, holidays, and rituals, parallel to, or independent of, their chosen religion. Presidents have often served in central roles in civil religion, and the nation provides quasi-religious honors to its martyrs—such as Abraham Lincoln and the soldiers killed in the American Civil War. Historians have noted presidential level use of civil religion rhetoric in profoundly moving episodes such as World War II, the Civil Rights Movement, and the September 11th attacks.\n\nIn a survey of more than fifty years of American civil religion scholarship, Squiers identifies fourteen principal tenets of the American civil religion:\n\n\nIn an examination of over fifty years of political discourse, Squiers finds that Filial piety, Reference to certain sacred texts and symbols of the ACR, The belief in God or a deity, America is a ‘city on a hill’ or a beacon of hope and righteousness, and America serves a higher purpose than self-interests are the most frequently referenced. He further found that there are no statistically significant differences in the amount of American civil religious language between Democrats and Republicans, incumbents and non-incumbents nor Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidates.\n\nThis belief system has historically been used to reject nonconformist ideas and groups. Theorists such as Bellah hold that American civil religion can perform the religious functions of integration, legitimation, and prophecy, while other theorists, such as Richard Fenn, disagree.\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville believed that Christianity was the source of the basic principles of liberal democracy, and the only religion capable of maintaining liberty in a democratic era. He was keenly aware of the mutual hatred between Christians and liberals in 19th-century France, rooted in the Enlightenment and the French Revolution. In France, Christianity was allied with the Old Regime before 1789 and the reactionary Bourbon Restoration of 1815-30. However he said Christianity was not antagonistic to democracy in the United States, where it was a bulwark against dangerous tendencies toward individualism and materialism, which would lead to atheism and tyranny.\n\nAlso important were the contributions of French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) and French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917).\n\nMost students of American civil religion follow the basic Bellah/Durkheimian interpretation. Other sources of this idea include philosopher John Dewey who spoke of \"common faith\" (1934); sociologist Robin Murphy Williams' \"American Society: A Sociological Interpretation\" (1951) which stated there was a \"common religion\" in America; sociologist Lloyd Warner's analysis of the Memorial Day celebrations in \"Yankee City\" (1953 [1974]); historian Martin Marty's \"religion in general\" (1959); theologian Will Herberg who spoke of \"the American Way of Life\" (1960, 1974); historian Sidney Mead's \"religion of the Republic\" (1963); and British writer G. K. Chesterton, who said that the United States was \"the only nation ... founded on a creed\" and also coined the phrase \"a nation with a soul of a church\".\n\nIn the same period, several distinguished historians such as Yehoshua Arieli, Daniel Boorstin, and Ralph Gabriel \"assessed the religious dimension of 'nationalism', the 'American creed', 'cultural religion' and the 'democratic faith'\".\n\nPremier sociologist Seymour Lipset (1963) referred to \"Americanism\" and the \"American Creed\" to characterize a distinct set of values that Americans hold with a quasi-religious fervor.\n\nToday, according to social scientist Ronald Wimberley and William Swatos, there seems to be a firm consensus among social scientists that there is a part of Americanism that is especially religious in nature, which may be termed civil religion. But this religious nature is less significant than the \"transcendent universal religion of the nation\" which late eighteenth century French intellectuals such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Alexis de Tocqueville wrote about.\n\nRonald Wimberley (1976) and other researchers collected large surveys and factor analytic studies which gave support to Bellah's argument that civil religion is a distinct cultural phenomenon within American society which is not embodied in American politics or denominational religion.\n\nExamples of civil religious beliefs are reflected in statements used in the research such as the following:\nLater research sought to determine who is civil religious. In a 1978 study by James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley, the researchers found that a wide cross section of American citizens have civil religious beliefs. In general though, college graduates and political or religious liberals appear to be somewhat less civil religious. Protestants and Catholics have the same level of civil religiosity. Religions that were created in the United States, the Latter Day Saints movement, Adventists, and Pentecostals, have the highest civil religiosity. Jews, Unitarians and those with no religious preference have the lowest civil religion. Even though there is variation in the scores, the \"great majority\" of Americans are found to share the types of civil religious beliefs which Bellah wrote about.\n\nFurther research found that civil religion plays a role in people's preferences for political candidates and policy positions. In 1980 Ronald Wimberley found that civil religious beliefs were more important than loyalties to a political party in predicting support for Nixon over McGovern with a sample of Sunday morning church goers who were surveyed near the election date and a general group of residents in the same community. In 1982 James Christenson and Ronald Wimberley found that civil religion was second only to occupation in predicting a person's political policy views.\n\nColeman has argued that civil religion is a widespread theme in history. He says it typically evolves in three phases: undifferentiation, state sponsorship in the period of modernization, differentiation. He supports his argument with comparative historical data from Japan, Imperial Rome, the Soviet Union, Turkey, France and The United States.\n\nThe American Revolution was the main source of civil religion. It produced a Moses-like leader (George Washington), prophets (Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine), apostles (John Adams, Benjamin Franklin) and martyrs (Boston Massacre, Nathan Hale), as well as devils (Benedict Arnold), sacred places (Valley Forge), rituals (raising the Liberty Tree), flags (the Betsy Ross flag), sacred holidays (July 4th) and a holy scripture (The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution).\n\nThe elitists who ran the Federalists were conscious of the need to boost voter identification with their party. Elections remained of central importance but for the rest of the political year celebrations, parades, festivals, and visual sensationalism were used. They employed multiple festivities, exciting parades, and even quasi-religious pilgrimages and \"sacred\" days that became incorporated into the American civil religion. George Washington was always its hero, and after his death he became a sort of demigod looking down from heaven to instill his blessings on the party.\n\nAt first the Federalists focused on commemoration of the ratification of the Constitution; they organized parades to demonstrate widespread popular support for the new Federalist Party. The parade organizers, incorporated secular versions of traditional religious themes and rituals, thereby fostering a highly visible celebration of the nation's new civil religion.\n\nThe Fourth of July became a semi-sacred day—a status it maintains in the 21st century. Its celebration in Boston proclaimed national over local patriotism, and included orations, dinners, militia musters, parades, marching bands, floats and fireworks. By 1800, the Fourth was closely identified with the Federalist party. Republicans were annoyed, and stage their own celebrations on the fourth—with rival parades sometimes clashing with each other. That generated even more excitement and larger crowds. After the collapse of the Federalists starting in 1815, the Fourth became a nonpartisan holiday.\n\nSince the days of George Washington presidents have assumed one of several roles in American civil religion, and that role has helped shape the presidency. Linder argues that:\n\nCharles W. Calhoun argues that in the 1880s the speeches of Benjamin Harrison display a rhetorical style that embraced American civic religion; indeed, Harrison was one of the credo's most adept presidential practitioners. Harrison was a leader whose application of Christian ethics to social and economic matters paved the way for the Social Gospel, the Progressive Movement and a national climate of acceptance regarding government action to resolve social problems.\n\nLinder argues that President Bill Clinton's sense of civil religion was based on his Baptist background in Arkansas. Commentator William Safire noted of the 1992 presidential campaign that, \"Never has the name of God been so frequently invoked, and never has this or any nation been so thoroughly and systematically blessed.\" Clinton speeches incorporated religious terminology that suggests the role of pastor rather than prophet or priest. With a universalistic outlook, he made no sharp distinction between the domestic and the foreign in presenting his vision of a world community of civil faith.\n\nBrocker argues that Europeans have often mischaracterized the politics of President George W. Bush (2001–2009) as directly inspired by Protestant fundamentalism. However, in his speeches Bush mostly actually used civil religious metaphors and images and rarely used language specific to any Christian denomination. His foreign policy, says Bocker, was based on American security interests and not on any fundamentalist teachings.\n\nHammer says that in his 2008 campaign speeches candidate Barack Obama portrays the American nation as a people unified by a shared belief in the American Creed and sanctified by the symbolism of an American civil religion.\n\nWould-be presidents likewise contributed to the rhetorical history of civil religion. The speeches of Daniel Webster were often memorized by student debaters, and his 1830 endorsement of \"Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable\" was iconic.\n\nAccording to Adam Goodheart, the modern meaning of the American flag, and the reverence of many Americans towards it, was forged by Major Robert Anderson's fight in defense of the flag at the Battle of Fort Sumter, which opened the American Civil War in April 1861. During the war the flag was used throughout the Union to symbolize American nationalism and rejection of secessionism. Goodheart explains the flag was transformed into a sacred symbol of patriotism:\n\nAn important dimension is the role of the soldiers, ready to sacrifice their lives to preserve the nation. They are memorialized in many monuments and semi-sacred days, such as Veterans Day and Memorial Day. Historian Jonathan Ebel argues that the \"soldier-savior\" is a sort of Messiah, who embodies the synthesis of civil religion, and the Christian ideals of sacrifice and redemption. In Europe, there are numerous cemeteries exclusively for American soldiers who fought in world wars. They have become American sacred spaces.\n\nPacifists have made some sharp criticisms. For example, Kelly Denton-Borhaug, writing from the Moravian peace tradition, argues that the theme of \"sacrifice\" has fueled the rise of what she calls \"U.S. war culture.\" The result is a diversion of attention from what she considers the militarism and the immoral, oppressive, sometimes barbaric conduct in the global American war on terror. However, some Protestant denominations such as the Churches of Christ, have largely turned away from pacifism to give greater support to patriotism and civil religion.\n\nKao and Copulsky argue the concept of civil religion illuminates the popular constitutional debate over the Pledge of Allegiance. The function of the pledge has aspects: preservationist, pluralist, priestly, and prophetic. The debate is not between those who believe in God and those who do not, but it is a dispute on the meaning and place of civil religion in America.\n\nCloud explores political oaths since 1787 and traces the tension between a need for national unity and a desire to affirm religious faith. He reviews major Supreme Court decisions involving the Pledge of Allegiance, including the contradictory \"Minersville School District v. Gobitis\" (1940) and \"West Virginia v. Barnette\" (1943) decisions. He argues that the Pledge was changed in 1954 during the Cold War to encourage school children to reject communism's atheistic philosophy by affirming belief in God.\n\nAdam Gamoran (1990) argues that civil religion in public schools can be seen in such daily rituals as the pledge of allegiance; in holiday observances, with activities such as music and art; and in the social studies, history and English curricula. Civil religion in schools plays a dual role: it socializes youth to a common set of understandings, but it also sets off subgroups of Americans whose backgrounds or beliefs prevent them from participating fully in civil religious ceremonies.\n\nThe Bellah argument deals with mainstream beliefs, but other scholars have looked at minorities outside the mainstream, and typically distrusted or disparaged by the mainstream, which have developed their own version of U.S. civil religion.\n\nWilson, noting the historic centrality of religion in Southern identity, argues that when the White South was outside the national mainstream in the late 19th century, it created its own pervasive common civil religion heavy with mythology, ritual, and organization. Wilson says the \"Lost Cause\"—that is, defeat in a holy war—has left some southerners to face guilt, doubt, and the triumph of what they perceive as evil: in other words, to form a tragic sense of life.\n\nWoodrum and Bell argue that black people demonstrate less civil religiosity than white people and that different predictors of civil religion operate among black and white people. For example, conventional religion positively influences white people's civil religion but negatively influences black peoples' civil religion. Woodrum and Bell interpret these results as a product of black American religious ethnogenesis and separatism.\n\nIwamura argues that the pilgrimages made by Japanese Americans to the sites of World War II-era internment camps have formed a Japanese American version of civil religion. Starting in 1969 the Reverend Sentoku Maeda and Reverend Soichi Wakahiro began pilgrimages to Manzanar National Historic Site in California. These pilgrimages included poetry readings, music, cultural events, a roll call of former internees, and a nondenominational ceremony with Protestant and Buddhist ministers and Catholic and Shinto priests. The event is designed to reinforce Japanese American cultural ties and to ensure that such injustices will never occur again.\n\nMexican-American labor leader César Chávez, by virtue of having holidays, stamps, and other commemorations of his actions, has practically become a \"saint\" in American civil religion, according to León. He was raised in the Catholic tradition and using Catholic rhetoric. His \"sacred acts,\" his political practices couched in Christian teachings, became influential to the burgeoning Chicano movement and strengthened his appeal. By acting on his moral convictions through nonviolent means, Chávez became sanctified in the national consciousness, says León.\n\nChristian language, rhetoric, and values helped colonists to perceive their political system as superior to the corrupt British monarchy. Ministers' sermons were instrumental in promoting patriotism and in motivating the colonists to take action against the evils and corruption of the British government. Together with the semi-religious tone sometimes adopted by preachers and such leaders as George Washington, and the notion that God favored the patriot cause, this made the documents of the Founding Fathers suitable as almost-sacred texts.\n\nThe National Archives Building in Washington preserves and displays the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Pauline Maier describes these texts as enshrined in massive, bronze-framed display cases. While political scientists, sociologists, and legal scholars study the Constitution and how it is used in American society, on the other hand, historians are concerned with putting themselves back into a time and place, in context. It would be anachronistic for them to look at the documents of the \"Charters of Freedom\" and see America's modern \"civic religion\" because of \"how much Americans have transformed very secular and temporal documents into sacred scriptures\". The whole business of erecting a shrine for the worship of the Declaration of Independence strikes some academic critics looking from point of view of the 1776 or 1789 America as \"idolatrous, and also curiously at odds with the values of the Revolution.\" It was suspicious of religious iconographic practices. At the beginning, in 1776, it was not meant to be that at all.\n\nOn the 1782 Great Seal of the United States, the date of the Declaration of Independence and the words under it signify the beginning of the \"new American Era\" on earth. Though the inscription, \"Novus ordo seclorum\", does not translate from the Latin as \"secular\", it also does not refer to a new order of heaven. It is a reference to generations of society in the western hemisphere, the millions of generations to come.\n\nEven from the vantage point of a new nation only ten to twenty years after the drafting of the Constitution, the Framers themselves differed in their assessments of its significance. Washington in his Farewell Address pleaded that \"the Constitution be sacredly maintained.\"' He echoed Madison in \"Federalist No. 49\", that citizen \"veneration\" of the Constitution might generate the intellectual stability needed to maintain even the \"wisest and freest governments\" amidst conflicting loyalties. But there is also a rich tradition of dissent from \"Constitution worship\". By 1816, Jefferson could write that \"some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched.\" But he saw imperfections and imagined that potentially, there could be others, believing as he did that \"institutions must advance also\".\n\nRegarding the United States Constitution, the position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is that it is a divinely inspired document.\n\nWhile the civil religion has been widely accepted by practically all denominations, one group has always stood against it. Seventh-Day Adventists deliberately pose as \"heretics\", so to speak, and refuse to perform in the sacred ceremonies like the Pledge of Allegiance or saluting the flag or treating Sundays as special. Indeed, says Bull, the denomination has defined its identity in contradistinction to precisely those elements of the host culture that have constituted civil religion.\n\nThe American identity has an ideological connection to these \"Charters of Freedom\". Samuel P. Huntington discusses common connections for most peoples in nation-states, a national identity as product of common ethnicity, ancestry and experience, common language, culture and religion. Levinson argues:\n\nThe creed, according to Huntington, is made up of (a) individual rights, (b) majority rule, and (c) a constitutional order of limited government power. American independence from Britain was not based on cultural difference, but on the adoption of principles found in the Declaration. Whittle Johnson in \"The Yale Review\" sees a sort of \"covenanting community\" of freedom under law, which, \"transcending the 'natural' bonds of race, religion and class, itself takes on transcendent importance\".\n\nBecoming a naturalized citizen of the United States requires passing a test covering a basic understanding of the Declaration, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, and taking an oath to support the U.S. Constitution. Hans Kohn described the United States Constitution as \"unlike any other: it represents the lifeblood of the American nation, its supreme symbol and manifestation. It is so intimately welded with the national existence itself that the two have become inseparable.\" Indeed, abolishing the Constitution in Huntington's view would abolish the United States, it would \"destroy the basis of community, eliminating the nation, [effecting] ... a return to nature.\"\n\nAs if to emphasize the lack of any alternative \"faith\" to the American nation, Thomas Grey in his article \"The Constitution as scripture\", contrasted those traditional societies with divinely appointed rulers enjoying heavenly mandates for social cohesion with that of the United States. He pointed out that Article VI, third clause, requires all political figures, both federal and state, \"be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution, but no religious test shall ever be required ...\" This was a major break not only with past British practice commingling authority of state and religion, but also with that of most American states when the Constitution was written.\n\nEscape clause. Whatever the oversights and evils the modern reader may see in the original Constitution, the Declaration that \"all men are created equal\"—in their rights—informed the Constitution in such a way that Frederick Douglass in 1860 could label the Constitution, if properly understood, as an antislavery document. He held that \"the constitutionality of slavery can be made out only by disregarding the plain and common-sense reading to the Constitution itself. [T]he Constitution will afford slavery no protection when it shall cease to be administered by slaveholders,\" a reference to the Supreme Court majority at the time. With a change of that majority, there was American precedent for judicial activism in Constitutional interpretation, including the Massachusetts Supreme Court, which had ended slavery there in 1783.\n\nAccumulations of Amendments under Article V of the Constitution and judicial review of Congressional and state law have fundamentally altered the relationship between U.S. citizens and their governments. Some scholars refer to the coming of a \"second Constitution\" with the Thirteenth Amendment, we are all free, the Fourteenth, we are all citizens, the Fifteenth, men vote, and the Nineteenth, women vote. The Fourteenth Amendment has been interpreted so as to require States to respect citizen rights in the same way that the Constitution has required the Federal government to respect them. So much so, that in 1972, the U.S. Representative from Texas, Barbara Jordan, could affirm, \"My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total ...\".\n\nAfter discussion of the Article V provision for change in the Constitution as a political stimulus to serious national consensus building, Sanford Levinson performed a thought experiment which was suggested at the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution in Philadelphia. If one were to sign the Constitution today, whatever our reservations might be, knowing what we do now, and transported back in time to its original shortcomings, great and small, \"signing the Constitution commits one not to closure but only to a process of becoming, and to taking responsibility for the political vision toward which I, joined I hope, with others, strive.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "219487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=219487", "title": "Bar association", "text": "Bar association\n\nA bar association is a professional association of lawyers. Some bar associations are responsible for the regulation of the legal profession in their jurisdiction; others are professional organizations dedicated to serving their members; in many cases, they are both. In many Commonwealth jurisdictions, the bar association comprises lawyers who are qualified as barristers or advocates in particular, versus solicitors (see \"bar council\"). Membership in bar associations may be mandatory or optional for practicing attorneys, depending on jurisdiction.\n\nThe use of the term \"bar\" to mean \"the whole body of lawyers, the legal profession\" comes ultimately from English custom. In the early 16th century, a railing divided the hall in the Inns of Court, with students occupying the body of the hall and readers or benchers on the other side. Students who officially became lawyers crossed the symbolic physical barrier and were \"admitted to the bar\". Later, this was popularly assumed to mean the wooden railing marking off the area around the judge's seat in a courtroom, where prisoners stood for arraignment and where a barrister stood to plead. In modern courtrooms, a railing may still be in place to enclose the space which is occupied by legal counsel as well as the criminal defendants and civil litigants who have business pending before the court.\n\nIn many Commonwealth jurisdictions, including in England and Wales, the \"bar association\" comprises lawyers who are qualified as barristers or advocates (collectively known as \"the bar\", or \"members of the bar\"), while the \"law society\" comprises solicitors. These bodies are sometimes mutually exclusive, while in other jurisdictions, the \"bar\" may refer to the entire community of persons engaged in the practice of law.\n\nIn Canada, one is \"called to the bar\" after undertaking a post-law-school training in a provincial law society program, and undergoing an apprenticeship or \"taking articles\". Legal communities are called \"provincial law societies\", except for Nova Scotia, where it is called the Nova Scotia Barristers' Society, and Quebec, where it is called the \"Barreau du Quebec\".\n\nThe Canadian Bar Association (and its provincial and territorial branches) is a professional association of barristers, solicitors and avocats that serves the roles of advocates for the profession, provides continuing legal education and member benefits. It does not play a part in the regulation of the profession, however.\n\nIn India under the legal framework set established under the Advocates Act, 1961, a law graduate is required to be enrolled with the Bar Council of India. The process of enrollment is delegated by the Bar Council of India to the state Bar Councils wherein almost each state has a Bar Council of its own. Once enrolled with a State Bar Council, the law graduate is recognized as an Advocate provisionally for a period of two years, within which they must clear the All India Bar Examination (AIBE) conducted by the Bar Council of India. Once the advocate clears the AIBE test, they are entitled to appear and practice before any court of law in India. There is no formal requirement for further membership of any Bar Association. However, Advocates do become members of various local or national bar associations for reasons of recognition and facilities which these associations offer. Some well-known Bar Associations in India include the Supreme Court Bar Association, Delhi High Court Bar Association, Bombay Bar Association, Delhi Bar Association, National Bar Association of India, All India Bar Association, etc.\n\nIn Pakistan, a person becomes a licensee of a Provincial Bar Council after fulfilling certain requirements. He must have a valid law degree LL.B from a recognized university by the Pakistan Bar council, must offer certain undertakings, and pay the Provincial Bar Council fees. Furthermore, he shall join any bar association as a member. Tehsil bar associations work under the umbrella of District Bar Association, District Bar Association under Provincial Bar councils, such as the Punjab Bar Council and Sindh Bar Council. To become an advocate, one must first complete six months pupillage with a practising advocate of High Court, whom they must assist on at least ten cases during a six-month pupillage.\n\nIn the United States, admission to the bar is permission granted by a particular court system to a lawyer to practice law in that system. This is to be distinguished from membership in a bar association. In the United States, some states require membership in the state bar association for all attorneys, while others do not.\n\nAlthough bar associations historically existed as unincorporated voluntary associations, nearly all bar associations have since been organized (or reorganized) as corporations. Furthermore, membership in some of them (see the next section below) is no longer voluntary, which is why some of them have omitted the word \"association\" and merely call themselves the \"state bar\" to indicate that they \"are\" the incorporated body that constitutes the entire admitted legal profession of a state.\n\nSome states require membership in the state's bar association to practice law there. Such an organization is called a mandatory, integrated, or unified bar, and is a type of government-granted monopoly. They exist at present in a slight majority of U.S. states: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington State, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands also have unified bars. The mandatory status of the Puerto Rico Bar Association was eliminated in 2009 by an act of the legislature, ratified by recently appointed majority of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court. By act of the Puerto Rico legislature, the mandatory status was reinstated in June, 2014. The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico struck down this act in October, 2014, finding that it unconstitutionally usurped its powers. \n\nIn some states, like Wisconsin, the mandatory membership requirement is implemented through an order of the state supreme court, which can be revoked or canceled at any time at the court's discretion. In others, like Oregon, the state legislature passed a law and created a government agency. California went farther than any other state and wrote the State Bar of California into its constitution.\n\nThe first state to have an integrated bar association was North Dakota in 1921.\n\nA voluntary bar association is a private organization of lawyers. However, the membership may not be restricted only to registered lawyers. The membership can extend to people interested in goals and purpose of the Association. Each Association chooses its own purposes (e.g., social, educational, and lobbying functions), but does not regulate the practice of law or admit lawyers to practice.\n\nThere is a statewide voluntary bar association in every state that has no mandatory or integrated bar association. There are also many voluntary bar associations organized by city, county, or other community. Such associations are often focused on common professional interests (such as bankruptcy lawyers or in-house counsel) or common ethnic interests (such as gender, race, religion, or national heritage), such as the Hispanic National Bar Association. The American Bar Association is the voluntary bar association with the largest membership. Such associations often advocate for law reform and provide information in bar journals, pro bono services or a lawyer referral service to the general public. In 2017, the California State Legislature split off the education, lobbying, and young lawyers sections of that state's Bar in order to create the voluntary California Lawyers Association. \n\nThere is no mandatory federal bar association. The Federal Bar Association is a private, voluntary group. \n\nThere are also a number of subject-specific private associations, which are not \"officially\" denominated as bar associations but which serve similar functions in terms of providing their members with useful publications, networking opportunities, and continuing legal education. The largest association of defense counsel is the Defense Research Institute (the \"Voice of the Defense Bar\"), while the largest association of plaintiffs' counsel is the American Association for Justice (formerly Association of Trial Lawyers of America). The National Lawyers Guild (NLG) is an association of progressive attorneys and legal workers, founded as the first national lawyer's association with membership open to all races and religions. \n\nMost American law schools have a student bar association, which is a student organization that fulfills various functions, including sometimes serving as the student government.\n\nJudges may or may not be members of the bar. Etymologically, they sit \"on the bench\", and the cases which come before them are \"at bar\" or \"at bench\". Many states in the United States require that some or all judges be members of the bar; typically these limit or completely prohibit the judges from practicing law while serving as a judge.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution contains no requirement that Federal judges or U.S. Supreme Court justices be members of the bar. However, there are no modern instances of the President nominating or the Congress approving any candidate who is not a member of any bar. There are various professional associations of judges, such as the American Judges Association, that perform some of the educational and other service functions of bar associations.\n\n"}
{"id": "33123430", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33123430", "title": "Buffett Rule", "text": "Buffett Rule\n\nThe Buffett Rule is part of a tax plan proposed by President Barack Obama in 2011. The tax plan would apply a minimum tax rate of 30 percent on individuals making more than one million dollars a year. According to a White House official, the new tax rate would directly affect 0.3 percent of taxpayers.\n\nThe Buffett Rule is named after American investor Warren Buffett, who publicly stated in early 2011 that he believed it was wrong that rich people, like himself, could pay less in federal taxes, as a portion of income, than the middle class, and voiced support for increased income taxes on the wealthy. The rule would implement a higher minimum tax rate for taxpayers in the highest income bracket, to ensure that they do not pay a lower percentage of income in taxes than less-affluent Americans. In October 2011, Senate leader Harry Reid (D–Nev.) proposed a 5.6 percent surtax on everyone making over a million dollars a year to pay for new stimulus provisions, but the change did not go through.\n\nA White House statement released in January 2012 defined the rule as part of \"measures to ensure everyone making over a million dollars a year pays a minimum effective tax rate of at least 30 percent ... implemented in a way that is equitable, including not disadvantaging individuals who make large charitable contributions.\" The White House also stated that \"no household making more than $1 million each year should pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than a middle-class family pays.\"\n\nThe Buffett Rule was not in the President's 2012 budget proposal and the White House initially stressed it as a guideline rather than a legislative initiative. The rule, however, was later submitted for deliberation as US Senate Bill S. 2059, \"Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012\". On April 16, 2012, the bill received 51 affirmative votes, but was stopped by a Republican filibuster that required 60 votes to proceed to debate and a vote on final passage.\n\nIf enacted, the rule change would result in $36.7 billion per year in additional tax revenue ($367 billion over the next decade), according to a January 2012 analysis by the Tax Foundation, a think tank. These figures assume that the 2001/2003/2010 tax cuts are not extended. If the 2001-2010 tax cuts do not expire as scheduled, estimated Buffett Rule revenues would total $162 billion over the decade. An alternative study released that same month by the Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal think tank which favors the change, stated that the change would add $50 billion per year in tax revenue ($500 billion over the decade). The United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation released a letter in March 2012 estimating that the Buffett Rule would raise $46.7 billion over the next decade. The divergent estimates come about because of different assumptions about the details of the Buffett Rule. For example, the Joint Committee on Taxation assumes that many high-income taxpayers would reduce the amount of capital gains realized in one year to fall beneath the Buffett Rule threshold.\n\nThe estimated $47 billion would offset by 0.7% the $6.4 trillion increase in spending over the next decade estimated by the Congressional Budget Office, based on President Obama's 2013 budget plan. Using the higher estimate from the Tax Foundation, the estimated $367 billion would offset by 5.7% the $6.4 trillion spending over the next decade.\n\nThe 2013 budget proposed by the Obama administration stated that the Buffett Rule should replace the Alternative Minimum Tax. The Joint Committee on Taxation calculated that the Buffett Rule plus the repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax would increase the deficit by $793.3 billion in the next decade. The $793.3 billion loss projected did not take into account additional proposed measures, such as incremental increases in retirement age and payroll tax lifetime contributions raised to $190,000 by 2020, about $22,000 higher than it would be under current law.\n\nPart of the reason for the inequality in taxation is that revenue from long-term capital gains is taxed at a maximum rate of 23.8%. It's not entirely clear how many individuals would be affected by the change. An October 2011 study by the Congressional Research Service found that a 30% minimum tax rate rule would mean up to 200,000 taxpayers, equivalent to 0.06% of all U.S. citizens, paying more.\n\nPaul Krugman, a \"New York Times\" columnist and Nobel Prize–winning economist, wrote in January 2012 that \"such low taxes on the very rich are indefensible\". He stated that \"the economic record certainly doesn’t support the notion that superlow taxes on the superrich are the key to prosperity\" asserting that since the U.S. economy added 11.5 million jobs during President Bill Clinton's first term, when the capital gains tax rate was over 29 percent, he thinks there's no real reason to keep from raising the tax rate.\n\nA CBS News/\"New York Times\" poll released in January 2012 found that 52 percent of Americans agreed that investments should be taxed at the same rate as income. A Gallup poll released in April 2012 also found that 60 percent of Americans support the rule. A similar poll released later that month by CNN found that 72 percent of Americans support the idea.\n\nRepresentative Paul Ryan (R–Wis.), who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee, criticized the new tax provisions. He labeled it as class warfare and also stated that it would negatively impact job creation and investment. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R–Ken.) said the conditions of the U.S. economy were ill-disposed to raising taxes. House Speaker John Boehner (R–Ohio) has spoken against the proposed rule and said that, \"there's a reason we have low rates on capital gains ... because it spurs new investment in our economy and allows capital to move more quickly.\" Dana Milbank from the \"Washington Post\" criticized the proposed tax as a gimmick, stating that President Obama was prioritizing the Buffett Rule over the Alternative Minimum Tax for political, not economic reasons.\n\n\n"}

Norwich progresses through the demise of the tetrarchic system and the rise of Constantine the Great as sole emperor, the foundation of Constantinople at the site of ancient Byzantium and the declaration of Christianity as state religion and the failure of Julian the Apostate's pagan reaction. Norwich then describes the period when the empire was split into two entities, one in the west and one in the east, which became known as the East Roman or Byzantine Empire. Norwich narrates the fall of the western empire and the era of Justinian I, the wars with the Persians under Heraclius, the beginning of the Muslim conquests and the eastern empire's fight for survival in the 7th century. The reaction to Byzantine Iconoclasm and the fall of the Isaurian dynasty lead to the ascension of Irene of Athens, and in turn to the coronation of the Frankish king Charlemagne as emperor in Christmas 800 in Rome by the Pope. Norwich chooses this event, which marks the end of the Byzantines' sole claim to imperial status and the unquestioned acceptance by the West of the emperor at Constantinople as sole head of all Christendom, as the decisive moment which defines the end of the early Byzantine period.\n\n\"The reader is conveyed in comfort, as it were in a very superior hovercraft, which glides smoothly over all the unevennes of the ground, to the regular, melodious sound of the author's prose.\" (\"Sunday Times\")\n\n\"He is brilliant... He writes like the most cultivated modern diplomat, attached by a freak of time to the Byzantine court, with intimate knowledge, tactful judgement and a consciousness of the surviving monuments.\" (\"The Independent\")\n\nThe book received a lukewarm review from \"The New York Times\". Norwich's writing was described as \"plummy\" and the historical detail he brings to the period is praised, but the reviewer thought at times the narrative was distant and the descriptions overly ornate.

The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.” Motion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An HVAC system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\nThe humidity and temperature of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock’s condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation.\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused.\n\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage. Such changes in character from the wood’s original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include “[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" \n\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This “[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.” \n\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock’s surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products “can actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.” Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\nA conservator who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to “[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].” Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as “Sometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].” Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\nHorological conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house Anglesey Abbey by the National Trust. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that \"The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune.\" The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. \"After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number.\" \n"}

It was built by Llywelyn the Great of the kingdom of Gwynedd but it was heavily modified following its capture by English forces of Edward I in the late 13th century.\n\nAlthough the stone castle was begun in the 1230s, there were three main building phases plus several periods of remodelling. The earliest part of the masonry castle is the inner ward which was started by Llywelyn the Great. Unlike most other Welsh native strongholds, the inner ward at Criccieth was protected by a gatehouse with twin D-shaped towers that was protected by a gate and portcullis, with murder holes in the passage, and outward facing arrowslits in each tower. This design might have been copied from English designs on the Marches at Beeston Castle, Cheshire or Montgomery Castle, Powys. The two towers of the gatehouse provided accommodation and their height was later increased in the Edwardian period. The castle's well was also in the gatehouse passage which was supplied by a spring fed cistern.\n\nIn the 1260s or 1270s, an outer ward was added during the second building phase under Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. A new gateway was added in the outer curtain with a large two-storey rectangular tower. The castle, although not a proper concentric design, now had two circuits of circular defences.\n\nCriccieth was taken by English forces in 1283. Under James of Saint George, another two storey rectangular tower connected to the rest of the castle by a curtain wall, the \"Engine Tower\" (now in ruins) might have been the foundation for a siege engine. The gatehouse had another storey added and several Welsh mural towers were strengthened. An outer barbican was added to the outer curtain wall.\n\nUnder Welsh stewardship, the principal residence was in the SW tower but when the castle was taken over by the English, accommodation was situated in the towers of the D-shaped gatehouse. Timber buildings, which included a great hall, were erected within the inner ward.\n\nA Motte and bailey stood at a different site in Criccieth before the masonry castle was built. In 1283 the castle was captured by English under the command of Edward I. It was then remodelled by James of St George.\n\nIn 1294, Madoc ap Llywelyn, a distant relation of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, began an uprising against English rule that spread quickly through Wales. Several English-held towns were razed and Criccieth (along with Harlech Castle and Aberystwyth Castle) were besieged that winter. Its residents survived until spring when the castle was resupplied.\n\nIn the 14th century the castle had a notable Welsh constable called Hywel ap Gruffydd, known as Howell the Axe, who fought for Edward III at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356.\n\nThe castle was used as a prison until 1404 when Welsh forces captured the castle during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr. The Welsh then tore down its walls and set the castle alight. Some stonework still show the scorch marks.\n\nCriccieth was also one of several locations Romantic artist Joseph Mallord William Turner used for his famous series of paintings depicting shipwrecked mariners.\n\nThe castle is maintained by Cadw. It includes exhibits and information on Welsh castles as well as the Anglo-Norman writer Gerald of Wales.\n\nThe constable of the castle was \"ex officio\" also the Mayor of Criccieth.\n\nSource The Castle Community: The Personnel of English and Welsh Castles, 1272-1422\n\n"}

Its stated objective was to \"examine the questions raised by the defence, the culture and the development of the French language and literature in Canada.\"\n\nOn February 14, 1911, the executive office of the Société du parler français au Canada (SPFC) resolved to organize and convoke a Congress on the French Language in Canada to be held in the course of 1912, in Quebec City, under the patronage of Université Laval. The SPFC set up an organizing committee composed of ten of its members, under the presidency of Mgr Paul-Eugène Roy, in order to set the date of the congress and see to the preparation of the event.\n\nSome two months later, on April 10, while the organizing was in progress, the committee sent a message \"to all the French Canadians and to all the Acadians who have at heart the conservation of their language and their nationality\" to invite them to take part to this first congress from Monday June 24 to Sunday June 30. While the Congress's name mentions the French language \"in Canada\", the organizers explicitly addressed their invitation to all the French speakers of America. Regional committees were formed by the general organizing committee to recruit members as much in Quebec as in Ontario, Western Canada, in the Atlantic provinces or the United States.\n\nThe organizing committee, wanting to make the congress a milestone event, sought the participation of civil society and the representatives of political and religious powers. The Quebec government, headed by Liberal premier Lomer Gouin was very favourable to holding the Congress in the historical capital of Quebec. In addition to the rooms of the Université Laval, the congress members were granted access to the rooms of the provincial Parliament Building.\n\nThe opening of the Congress on June 24 was intended to associate the event with a great day of patriotism and confer to it a solemn, popular and festive character. On June 23 and 24, just before the official opening of the Congress, its members were invited to participate to the \"National Day of the French Canadians\" which was organized by the Saint-Sauveur de Québec chapter of the Association Saint-Jean-Baptiste (ASJB) and other affiliated branches. As part of the programme were the traditional mass, procession, banquet, speeches, entertainment, etc.\n\nAt 8:00 PM on June 24, the opening session of the Congress held in the \"Salle des exercices militaires\" on Grande Allée street was the occasion of great pomp with music and speeches from the principal officers of the Congress, the Lieutenant Governor François Langelier, members of the Catholic clergy, the former prime minister of Canada Wilfrid Laurier, the premier of Quebec Lomer Gouin, Charles-Eudes Bonin, of the general consulate of France in Quebec City, Étienne Lamy, delegate of the Académie française, the mayor of Quebec Napoléon Drouin, ministers from the provinces of Ontario and the Maritimes, etc.\n\nThe room was decorated with the flags of Great Britain, Canada, Quebec, France, the United States, and also the Carillon Sacré-Cœur. The musicians played God Save the Queen, the national anthem of both Great Britain and the Dominion of Canada, Ô Canada, then the national anthem of French Canadians, as well as other patriotic or traditional airs such as \"Vive la Canadienne\", \"À la claire fontaine\", \"Ô Canada! mon pays, mes amours\", etc.\n\nThe Congress was made of four study sections: scientific, pedagogical, literary and propaganda. It held eight general sessions in addition to the various sessions of each section which occurred independently under the direction of their own executive office. In the sessions held by the study sections, participants presented memoirs, gave speeches, deliberated and formulated \"vows\" and propositions related to their study field. In the general sessions, participants gave patriotic speeches on the French language and \"rapporteurs\" gave an account of the work done by the sections before all congress members. The assembly of all congress members ratified the reports and voted for or against the vows and propositions coming from the sections.\n\nIndividuals who became member of the congress received a 96-page \"Guide du congressiste\", and a medal badge crafted by Alexandre Morlon on which were carved the words of French poet Gustave Zidler: \"C'est notre doux parler qui nous conserve frères.\" (\"It is our gentle speech that keeps us brothers.\")\n\nIn addition to the serious work of the different study sections, the programme of the Congress included activities of a more symbolic character such as the inauguration, Tuesday June 25 at 3:00PM, of the monument to Honoré Mercier on the Quebec parliamentary hill, the awarding of honorific diplomas from the Université Laval, as well as other activities that today would be judged \"touristic\", such as the Wednesday June 26 morning expedition to the Petit-Cap, the summer residence of the \"Messieurs\" of the Séminaire de Québec, located in Saint-Joachim de Montmorency. Abbott Charles Thellier de Poncheville and poet Gustave Zidler, who arrived on the morning of June 26, took part to this excursion where congress members feasted, sang songs, read poems, and gave more speeches.\n\nFriday June 28 was reserved to the delegates of New England, Armand Bédard, president of the Boston Franco-American Historical Society and Mr. Henri-T. Ledoux, president of the Union Saint-Jean-Baptiste d'Amérique, who came to Quebec to give the right hour on the situation of the francophone communities in the United States.\n\nOn the morning of Saturday June 29, the plenary assembly of the congress unanimously adopted the proposition of MM. Jean-Baptiste Lagacé and Adjutor Rivard to set up a Permanent Committee of the Congresses on the French language in America whose purpose was \"to defend, to cultivate, extend, and develop the French language and literature in Canada and in general among the Acadians and French Canadians of North America\". In addition to this general mandate, the permanent committee was given the specific mandate to \"ensure the publication of the acts, the realization of the vows, and the continuation of the work of the Congress on the French language in Canada\". At 9:00PM, at diner was held in the celebration room of the Château Frontenac, which in 1912 was only 20 years old.\n\nOn Sunday June 30, at 9:00AM, a mass was given at the Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral and in the afternoon, a procession organized by the Association catholique de la jeunesse canadienne-française (ACJC) circulated in Quebec City. A closing general session was held at the \"Salle des exercices militaires\", and afterwards all members were invited to attend a fireworks show before the Parliament.\n\nThe four sections of the Congress received a total of 65 memoirs.\n\nOf the 19 memoirs pertaining to scientific subjects, seven were concerned with the history of the French language in Canada, seven other pertained to the legal situation of French throughout the Canadian federation and in the United States, and the remaining five discussed the philological questions.\n\nThe 21 memoirs of the education section gave Congress members a statistical overview of the teaching of French in Canada and the United States.\n\nThe 10 memoirs presented to the literary section discussed the state and future of Canadian literature, its development and propagation, its place in schools, etc.\n\nThe 15 memoirs of the section on propaganda were concerned with the quality of French in the press, in the associations, at home, in industry, trade, sciences and public service.\n\nThe first congress led to the adoption of a long series of declarations and vows by the congress members who took part to the different study sections.\n\n\nThe sub-section on history formulated four vows:\n\n\nThe sub-section on law:\n\n\nThe sub-section on philology:\n\n\n\nConcerning primary education, the pedagogical section formulated the vows:\n\n\nConcerning secondary education, its vows were:\n\n\n\nThe literary section's vows were:\n\n\n\nThe three sub-sections of the propaganda section formulated numerous vows.\n\nSub-section A (associations) wanted:\n\n\nSub-section B (family, social relations, the press, etc.):\n\n\nSub-section C (commerce, industry, the arts and sciences):\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22577681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22577681", "title": "Flatness (art)", "text": "Flatness (art)\n\nIn art criticism of the 1960s and 1970s, flatness described the smoothness and absence of curvature or surface detail of a two-dimensional work of art. Critic Clement Greenberg believed that flatness, or two-dimensional, was an essential and desirable quality in painting, a criterion which implies rejection of painterliness and impasto. The valorization of flatness led to a number of art movements, including minimalism and post-painterly abstractionism.\n\nModernism of the arts happened during the second half of the 19th century and extended into most of the 20th. This period of art is identified by art forms consisting of an image on a flat two-dimensional surface. This art evolution began in the 1860s and culminated 50 years later. By this time almost all three-dimensional works had been eliminated. This new approach to painting was to create a visual appearance of realism. Looking at a surface with only two-dimensions our perception of depth is an illusion. The reduction of depth in painting was the consequence of investigation. This new essence of self-analysis attempted to establish an experience or effect from the viewer of the painting.\n\nThe term flatness can be used to describe much of the popular American art work of the 1950s and 1960s. The art of this period had a basic yet colorful design that held a degree of two dimensional form. Thus the term flatness is used to describe this medium. The ground work idea for Minimalism began in Russia in 1913 when Kazimir Malevich placed a black square on a white background claiming that: “Art no longer cares to serve the state and religion it no longer wishes to illustrate the history of manners, it wants to have nothing further to do with the object as such, and believes that it can exist in and for itself without things.”\n\nOne of the first Minimalism artworks was created in 1964 by Dan Flavin. He produced a neon sculpture titled \"Monument for V. Tatlin\". This work was a simplistic assembly of neon tubes that were not carved or constructed in any way. The idea was that they were not supposed to symbolize anything but to just merely exist. The Minimalist approach to art was to conceive by the mind before execution. Traditional modes of art composition were looked away from in favor of improvisation, spontaneity and automatism. This new expressionist style consisted of improvised pattern making where every stroke of the brush was viewed as expression and subjective freedom.\n\nThis concept inspired a whole new art form called Pop Art. It retained the color scheme and simplicity of Minimalism, but it borrowed images from pop culture to become relatable. The works now in question held a meaning for the viewer with familiar imagery but it still retained the avant-garde approach of Minimalism. Pop Art is a well-recognized movement for 1960s culture. This type of art was very free form fashionable and rebellious. It was wild and colorful but many works retained the idea of two dimensional flatness.\n\nPop Art fell out of fashion and a new movement came into being. Op Art or Optic Art was now the latest trend in home décor and fashion. This form of modern art shares a strong relationship with the culture thought and design of the 1960s. This new art form focused on non-objective painting that focused on design, color, form, and line. These paintings where hand drawn or created with a mechanical aid. They featured a flat looking two dimensional design that could appear to pop out in an almost three dimensional form. Some pieces look as if they are moving due to shape and line placement creating a trick of the eye. This form of art was created to test the limits of the conscious perception of the viewer.\n\nBright colors were no longer favored as much of Op Art is black and white with little use of color. The designs presented migrated back to the Minimalist idea of art simply existing and not representing an ideal. A well noted artist of this style is Bridget Riley who shaped the contemporary art scene of the early 50s and 70s. Her works are designed to pull the eye in such a way to stretch and disorder the perceptual sense. She is considered a ground breaking artist in the realm of modern art. Her work mainly consists of detailed line and circle patterns to create an optical challenge for the viewer.\n\nRiley composes her art with the thought in mind; that we all have a narrow view on how we see things and our vision is rarely stretched to new abilities. Her work confronts the observer with new imaginative sensations, and the overall purpose of the artist’s disappears and is replaced with what the viewer conceives. This form of art has no clear outlined theme therefore it allows total freedom for one to compose their imagination. Riley’s work ignores object and instead focuses on movement to create a seemingly endless pattern. Riley’s art appeared in the fashion of that era. Similar patterns still remain popular in clothing today.\n"}
{"id": "50066569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50066569", "title": "Gender democracy", "text": "Gender democracy\n\nGender democracy is a normative idea related to gender mainstreaming. Its aim is to achieve democratic conditions between men and women within society as a whole, as well as specifically within companies, bureaucracies, and other organizations. Among other things, this is realized by means of gender trainings that raise awareness of existing inequalities and develop methods to democratize relations between genders. The term gender democracy was first coined and developed by German sociologist Halina Bedkowski.\n\nAccording to Halina Bendkowski she developed the term and concept of gender democracy in the early 1990s during a \"research trip to the US, which had been commissioned by Austria's Minister for Women, Johanna Dohal, with the aim of identifying innovative projects against domestic violence.\" Subsequently, in 1993, the term appeared on the title of a publication edited by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Education and Women's Affairs, \"Test the West: Geschlechterdemokratie und Gewalt\" (Test the West: Gender Democracy and Violence).\n\nThe pioneers of gender democracy refused to provide a fixed and static definition of the term. Bedkowski stated: \"As soon as a term has been defined in a dictionary and recycled by other theorists, it will have lost most of its vitality. It is true, terms are alive - and this is especially true for terms that have been developed in the course of actual political conflicts.\" Gunda Werner, who in 1999 outlined the basic tenets of gender democracy for the Heinrich Böll Foundation, explained: \"Gender democracy has no ready-made theoretical or practical precepts. It is an exploratory movement in search of new outlooks and models.\" Despite this, some of the fundamentals of gender democracy can be defined:\n\n\nGender democracy aims to achieve the equal participation of women and men in politics, the corporate world, and in all parts of society by reforming and abolishing undemocratic structures and all forms of power that are based on oppression and violence. This approach is based on a broad definition of democracy - one that demands equal rights and opportunities for people in all their diversity. As there is a large number of gender identities, gender democracy rejects the male // female dichotomy, arguing instead that each human being - female, male, or otherwise - must have the right and the ability to self-determine their lifestyles, type of relationships in ways that go beyond stereotypical notions and any type of essentialism about men and women.\n\nGender democracy investigates and questions structures and contents of democratic systems that were developed by men in order to transform them in ways that provide for gender equality. A key tool for implementing gender democracy are the so-called \"gender traings\" that aim to question traditional gender roles, analyze the social framework, and develop methods that provide for greater gender equality within organizations.\n\nThe following are some examples for organizations that have made gender democracy part of their institutional structures:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This is especially prevalent in architecture, such as revival architecture. Through a combination of different styles or implementation of new elements, historicism can create completely different aesthetics than former styles. Thus it offers a great variety of possible designs.\n\nIn the history of art, after Neoclassicism which in the Romantic era could itself be considered a historicist movement, the 19th century saw a new historicist phase marked by an interpretation not only of Greek and Roman classicism, but also of succeeding stylistic eras, which were increasingly considered equivalent. In particular in architecture and in the genre of history painting, in which historical subjects were treated of with great attention to accurate period detail, the global influence of historicism was especially strong from the 1850s onwards. The change is often related to the rise of the bourgeoisie during and after the Industrial Revolution. By the end of the century, in the \"fin de siècle\", Symbolism and Art Nouveau followed by Expressionism and Modernism acted to make Historicism look outdated, although many large public commissions continued in the 20th century. The Arts and Crafts movement managed to combine a looser vernacular historicism with elements of Art Nouveau and other contemporary styles.\n\nInfluences of historicism remained strong until the 1950s in many countries.

He was the twenty-first president of the Association for Asian Studies and a scholar who specialized in the history of India during the time of the British Raj.\n\nBorn in Boston, Massachusetts in 1903, Furber was almost entirely educated in the Boston area, where he attended Brookline High School before graduating from Harvard University in 1924. He received his doctorate from Harvard in 1929 and at the same time attended Oxford University, where he completed a bachelor's degree in 1925 and a master's degree in 1930. In 1931, during his nine-year career as a lecturer at Harvard, he published his first book, \"Henry Dundas, First Viscount Melville\", followed within two years by his edition of \"The Correspondence of Sir John Shore, Governor General, with Henry Dundas, President of the Board of Control, 1793-1798\". Furber's potential as a young scholar was identified with the awarding of a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1937–38. He was appointed to the post of assistant professor at the University of Texas in 1940 but soon received an assignment to the Office of Strategic Services (which later became the CIA) to work as a social science analyst after the United States entered the Second World War. From 1943 to 1945, Furber served the US State Department as a specialist on the British Commonwealth, before returning to the University of Texas, where he stayed until 1948.\n\nIt was at that point that Furber published what was regarded as his most creative book, \"John Company at Work\". For this study of the country trade in Asia, European trade from one point in Asia to another, Furber pored through Dutch, French, and Danish, as well as British archives. He concluded that private British trading interests combined with Indian merchants to play a dynamic role in a network of trade which ultimately led to the establishment of the British Raj in India. The American Historical Association recognised the book with the Watumull Prize in 1949. In the meantime, Furber lectured at the University of Madras in 1948, before moving to the University of Pennsylvania, where he served as Professor of History until 1973. It was at Pennsylvania that he formed a close working relationship with W. Norman Brown and significantly contributed to the building of a program for studying the Indian subcontinent. He traveled to India in 1962 to deliver the Heras Lectures at the University of Bombay, which were published under the title \"The Bombay Presidency in the Mid-18th Century\". In 1965 co-edited the fifth volume of the series entitled \"The Correspondence of Edmund Burke\". This volume documented the period between July 1782 and June 1789 during which Burke's constructive interest in Indian affairs yielded to an \"implacable determination\" to defeat Hastings in the latter's impeachment trial. Furber interpreted these letters as re-enforcement for the \"view held in India today\" that Burke was a \"champion of Bengal's downtrodden millions.\"\n\nFurber was a member of the Royal Historical Society and was the president of the Association for Asian Studies from 1968 to 1969. In retirement, he published his ambitious survey, \"Rival Empires of Trade in the Orient 1600-1800\", which applied the themes elucidated in \"John Company at Work\" back to earlier times. Furber's last book was dedicated to Elizabeth Chapin Furber, his first wife and a scholar of medieval French history, who died at the time of his retirement. His second wife Lucy Richardson was the classmate of a widow, whom he escorted to his 50th reunion at Harvard. They married seven years later and they periodically lived at his summer home at Marblehead, Massachusetts, and her family home in Concord, Massachusetts. He died during his sleep on January 19, 1993 in Bedford, Massachusetts.\n"}
{"id": "9507460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9507460", "title": "In the Jailhouse Now", "text": "In the Jailhouse Now\n\n\"In the Jailhouse Now\" is an American novelty blues song originally found in vaudeville performances from the early 20th century, usually credited to Jimmie Rodgers. The song's first two verses trace the exploits of Ramblin’ Bob, who cheats at cards and gets caught, while the final verse tells about taking a girl named Susie out on the town and winding up in jail together.\n\nRodgers version of \"In the Jailhouse Now\" was recorded February 15, 1928, in Camden, New Jersey, and features Rodgers on vocals and guitar, with Ellsworth T. Cozzens playing banjo. Rodgers included his famous yodel throughout the song. He recorded a sequel titled \"In the Jailhouse Now—No. 2\" in Hollywood, California, in 1930, which follows the misadventures of a man named Campbell.\n\nThe song has been covered many times, most frequently with Jimmie Rodgers’ version. Artists who have sung it include Tommy Duncan, Webb Pierce, Pink Anderson, Johnny Cash, Jim Jackson, Leon Russell, Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions (featuring Jerry Garcia), Merle Haggard, Doc Watson, Prism, Suzy Bogguss (with Chet Atkins), and Tim Blake Nelson with The Soggy Bottom Boys in the film and soundtrack for \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\". It was also one of the first songs learned by a teenage Joan Baez. The song shows up under different titles including \"He's in the Jailhouse Now,\" and some versions use the line \"She's in the graveyard now\" in the chorus.\n\nPrior to 1930, several different versions of it were recorded and copyrighted. The earliest is Davis and Stafford's 1915 version, which has verses about a man named Campbell cheating at a card game and a corrupt election. In 1924, Whistler's Jug Band from Louisville, Kentucky, recorded it under the title \"Jail House Blues,\" which was the same title as a famous blues tune by Bessie Smith but was, in fact, the same song as \"In the Jailhouse Now\".\n\nIn 1927, Earl McDonald's Original Louisville Jug Band made another recording of the song. Two African-American bluesmen also recorded the song prior to Rodgers: Blind Blake (in 1927), and Jim Jackson (in January 1928). Jackson also copyrighted the song before Rodgers. Finally, in 1930, the Memphis Sheiks (a pseudonym for the Memphis Jug Band) recorded it in a version that scholars have often claimed, albeit mistakenly, was a cover of Jimmie Rodgers. The version of the melody and lyrics that they used, is clearly derived from the Louisville Jug Band performances, not Rodgers. On some of the Memphis Sheiks' records, an African-American vaudeville performer named Bert Murphy is given credit for writing the song.\n\nShortly after Rodgers recorded the song, three additional versions appeared that were decidedly not covers of Rodgers. Boyd Senter and his Senterpedes did a jazz version in 1929 for Victor Records (issued on #22010, and later reissued on Bluebird Records #5545); Gene Kardos and His Orchestra also did a jazz version in 1932 for Victor; and Billy Mitchell did a stride piano and shouter version of it in 1936 for the Bluebird label.\n\nAfter Rodgers, the best-known version of the song was by Webb Pierce, who had a No. 1 country hit with the song in 1955. Pierce's version spent No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" country chart for 21 weeks, becoming the third song in the chart's history to spend as long on the chart; previously, Eddy Arnold (\"I'll Hold You in My Heart (Till I Can Hold You in My Arms),\" 1947) and Hank Snow (\"I'm Movin' On,\" 1950) achieved the feat. For 58 years, those three songs held the longevity record for most weeks at No. 1 with 21 weeks, with only a handful of songs coming within a month of matching the record into the early 1960s. Finally, on August 10, 2013, \"Cruise\" by Florida Georgia Line surpassed Pierce's \"In the Jailhouse Now\" for most weeks at No. 1 when it spent its 22nd week at No. 1.\n\nWhen Johnny Cash recorded the song in 1962, he used lyrics that are different from Jimmie Rodgers' versions which Cash learned from the African-American jug band musicians in Memphis. In spite of this, most writers claim that Cash was covering Jimmie Rodgers' song, which further obscures that the song originated with African-American performers and was kept alive in a vaudeville and jug band tradition for many decades.\n\nThe song regained popularity years later when Sonny James recorded a live version during a 1976 concert at Tennessee State Prison. James' version included backing by the Tennessee State Prison Band, and peaked at No. 15 on the Hot Country Singles chart in 1977.\n\nThe Jimmie Rodgers version was sung by Gene Autry in his 1941 movie \"Back in the Saddle.\"\n\nIn \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\", \"Delmar\" (Tim Blake Nelson) sings a rendition, with \"Pete\" (John Turturro) yodeling between the verses, prior to the Soggy Bottom Boys' main number, \"Man of Constant Sorrow\". The other \"Soggy Bottom Boys\" songs are lip-synched, but Tim Blake Nelson sings his own vocals on this song, while Turturro's yodeling is actually performed by Pat Enright of the Nashville Bluegrass Band.\n\nIn 1979, the song was done in a blackface performance in the musical \"One Mo' Time\" by Vernel Bagneris. The musical was revived on Broadway in 2002. The version of the song used in the show was the same as that recorded by the Louisville Jug Bands in the 1920s.\n\nBrad Paisley used the chorus for the end of \"Mr. Policeman,\" a song on his 2007 album \"5th Gear\". New lyrics were written to provide an ending to the song's story.\n\n"}

He was born in Crossmolina, Co. Mayo, Ireland. A committed Roman Catholic, O'Hart originally planned to become Catholic priest but instead spent 2 years as a police officer. He was an Associate in Arts at the Queen's University of Belfast. He worked at the Commissioners of National Education during the years of the Great Irish Famine. He worked as a genealogist and took an interest in Irish history. He was an Irish nationalist. He died in 1902 in Clontarf near Dublin, at the age of 78.\n\nO'Hart's 800-page \"The Irish and Anglo-Irish landed gentry\" (Dublin 1884) was reprinted in 1969, with an introduction by Edward MacLysaght, the first Chief Herald of Ireland. Another work, \"Irish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation\", first published in 1876, has come out in several subsequent editions.\n\nTo complete his genealogies he used the writings of Cú Choigcríche Ó Cléirigh, Duald Mac Firbis and O'Farrell, along with the Annals of the Four Masters, for the medieval pedigrees. He used the works of Bernard Burke, John Collins and others to extend his genealogies past the 17th century.\n\nIn his \"Irish Pedigrees\", O'Hart presents the legendary origins of the Irish people, from the Biblical Adam and Eve through the kings of ancient Ireland. Irish tradition holds that every Irish person is descended from the king Milesius who emigrated from Spain in approximately 1700 BC, according to the Annals of the Four Masters. O'Hart started each of his genealogies with Adam recording Milesius as his 36th descendant.\n\nFrom the start; <br>\n(1) Adam, his son<br>\n(2) Seth, his son<br>\n(3) Enos, his son<br>\n(4) Cainan, his son<br>\n(5) Mahalaleel, his son<br>\n(6) Jared, his son<br>\n(7) Enoch, his son<br>\n(8) Methuselah, his son<br>\n(9) Lamech, his son<br>\n(10) Noah, his son<br>\n(11) Japhet, his son<br>\n(12) Magog, his son<br>\n(13) Baoth \"to whom Scythia came has his lot,\" his son<br>\n(14) Phoeniusa Farsaidh (Fenius Farsa) King of Scythia, his son<br>\n(15) Niul, his son<br>\n(16) Gaodhal (Gathelus), his son<br>\n(17) Asruth, his son<br>\n(18) Sruth (who fled Egypt to Creta), his son<br>\n(19) Heber Scut (returned to Scythia), his son<br>\n(20) Beouman, King of Scythia, his son<br>\n(21) Ogaman King of Scythia, his son<br>\n(22) Tait King of Scythia, his son<br>\n(23) Agnon (who fled Scythia by sea with the majority of his people), his son<br>\n(24) Lamhfionn (who led his people to Gothia or Getulia, where Carthage was afterwards built), his son<br>\n(25) Heber Glunfionn King of Gothia, his son<br>\n(26) Agnan Fionn King of Gothia, his son<br>\n(27) Febric Glas King of Gothia, his son<br>\n(28) Nenuall King of Gothia, his son<br>\n(29) Nuadhad King of Gothia, his son<br>\n(30) Alladh King of Gothia, his son<br>\n(31) Arcadh King of Gothia, his son<br>\n(32) Deag King of Gothia, his son<br>\n(33) Brath King of Gothia (who left Gothia with a large band of his people and settled in Galicia, Spain), his son<br>\n(34) Breoghan King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal, his son<br>\n(35) Bile King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal, and his son<br>\n(36) Galamh (also known as Milesius of Spain) King of Galicia, Andalusia, Murcia, Castile, and Portugal.\n\nAccording to O'Hart's account, Milesius had four sons, Heber, Ir, Heremon, and Amergin, who were involved, along with their uncle Ithe, in the invasion of ancient Ireland; Milesius, himself, had died during the planning. Because Amergin died during the invasion, he died without issue. It is from the four other invaders--Heber, Ir, Heremon, and Ithe—that the Irish are alleged to descend. These, according to O'Hart, are the four lines from which all true Irish descend. Conn of the Hundred Battles was a descendant of Erimon, and Brian Boru was descended from both Heber and Conn.\n\nIrish pedigrees; or, The origin and stem of the Irish nation (1892), by John O'Hart, is available in 2 volumes free on the Internet Archive.\n\nAnother book by John O'Hart is also available free on the Internet Archive.\n\n"}

The blunted edge of the weapon's tip also served as an effective bludgeon, as well as a hook. These weapons changed from bronze to iron in the New Kingdom period. The earliest known depiction of a khopesh is from the Stele of Vultures, depicting King Eannatum of Lagash wielding the weapon; this would date the khopesh to at least 2500 BC.\n\nThe word 'khopesh' may have derived from 'leg', as in 'leg of beef', because of their similarity in shape. The hieroglyph for \"ḫpš\" ('leg') is found as early as during the time of the Coffin Texts (the First Intermediate Period).\n\nThe blade is only sharpened on the outside portion of the curved end. The khopesh evolved from the epsilon or similar crescent-shaped axes that were used in warfare. The khopesh went out of use around 1300 BC. However, in the 196 BC Rosetta Stone it is referenced as the \"sword\" determinative in a hieroglyphic block, with the spelled letters of kh, p, and sh to say:\n\nVarious pharaohs are depicted with a khopesh, and some have been found in royal graves, such as the two examples found with Tutankhamun.\n\nAlthough some examples are clearly sharpened, many examples have dull edges that apparently were never intended to be sharp. It may therefore be possible that some khopeshes found in high status graves were ceremonial variants.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14136719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14136719", "title": "Lauriston Sharp", "text": "Lauriston Sharp\n\nLauriston Sharp (March 24, 1907 – December 31, 1993) was a Goldwin Smith Professor of Anthropology and Asian Studies at Cornell University. He was the first person appointed in anthropology at the university, and he created its Southeast Asia Program, research centers in Asia and North and South America, a multidisciplinary faculty and strong language program. He was a founding member of the Society for Applied Anthropology and a founding trustee of the Asia Society.\n\nSharp was born in 1907 in Madison, Wisconsin, where he grew up. His father was a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Sharp attended this same institution, studying for a Bachelor of Arts (BA). While majoring in philosophy, Sharp went with friends Clyde Kluckhohn and John J. Hanks on summer treks to archaeological sites on the Kaiparowitz Plateau in Arizona and Utah. These expeditions sparked his interest in the concrete, culturally informed anthropologist's perspective on human nature, in contrast to the more abstract, universalizing view of a philosopher.\n\nAfter graduating with his BA in 1929, Sharp identified anthropology and Southeast Asian studies as his career focus. He encountered Berber culture while on an expedition to Algeria in 1930 with the Beloit-Logan Museum. Sharp moved to Austria to study Southeast Asian Ethnology under Robert Heine-Geldern, receiving the Certificate in Anthropology from the University of Vienna in 1931. He enrolled in the PhD program at Harvard University in 1932 and completed his thesis in 1937, after two years of fieldwork studying Australian Aborigines.\n\nSharp married Ruth Burdick, and they had a family. She contributed to the Bennington-Cornell Thailand Project with expertise in anthropology and ceramics. They had a son named Alexander and a daughter named Suki.\n\nProfessor Sharp began teaching at Cornell in 1936; he was the university's first appointment in anthropology. He remained devoted to Cornell, creating and directing programs, and teaching at and remaining connected with the university for 56 years. He remained active as the Goldwin Smith Professor Emeritus, even after his formal retirement in 1973.\n\nDuring an appointment at the State Department in 1945 and 1946, Sharp was an assistant division chief for Southeast Asian affairs. Upon returning to Cornell, Sharp oversaw the expansion of the anthropology program, making it a leading center for graduate training and research. His vision of anthropology was to emphasize an applied orientation and focus on area studies. He established Cornell research centers in South and Southeast Asia and North and South America.\n\nIn 1947, Sharp began the Cornell-Thailand Project, a ground-breaking initiative to collate baseline data in a comprehensive study of a farming village (\"Bang Chan\") on the outskirts of Bangkok. Sharp also founded and was the first director between 1950 and 1960 of Cornell's Southeast Asia Program, for which he recruited a multi-disciplinary faculty, developed a strong language program and started what become the foremost library resource on South East Asia.\n\nSharp provided for scholars from the areas studied to receive training in such programs, in addition to hundreds of Western scholars. He chaired the Cornell Faculty Committee, which in 1961 saw the creation of the university's Center for International Studies. Aside from realizing Sharp's longtime dream of Southeast Asian research, the Thailand project also marked the start of his collaboration with Lucien Hanks and Jane Hanks of Bennington College. This continued in the Bennington-Cornell Project started in 1963, which entailed a broad regional survey of the upland and lowland peoples of northern Thailand. His wife, Ruth Burdick Sharp, contributed her acquired expertise in anthropology and ceramics to this project.\n\nDespite health problems which made field research difficult after retirement, Sharp maintained his activity at Cornell and abroad. He worked with his research documents on Thailand as well as on Australian Aborigines.\n\nSharp's professional career spanned wide geographical areas. As a scholar-researcher, he studied indigenous cultures on four continents. Several of his publications became classics in their fields: \"Steel Axes for Stone-Age Australians\" (1952), \"People Without Politics\" (1958), and \"Cultural Continuities and Discontinuities in Southeast Asia\" (1962). A number of his coauthored works exhibited his multidisciplinary research and interest in culture change, such as \"Siamese Rice Village\" (1953) and \"Bang Chan: Social History of A Rural Community in Thailand\" (1978). Sharp had a reputation for passion in passing on his experiences to future generations.\n\nSharp was president of the Association for Asian Studies from 1961 to 1962. He was a founding member of the Society for Applied Anthropology and a founding trustee of the Asia Society. He served on the governing boards of the American Anthropological Association and the Siam Society.\n\nHe won Guggenheim, Fulbright, and National Endowment for the Humanities fellowships. Upon retiring, he was presented with a two-volume \"festschrift\", one celebrating his contributions to studies of cultural change and applied anthropology, the other recognizing his contributions to Thai studies.\n\nHe died at the age of 86 at his Ithaca, New York home on December 31, 1993.\n\nCo-authored: \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19669", "title": "Marx Brothers", "text": "Marx Brothers\n\nThe Marx Brothers were an American family comedy act that was successful in vaudeville, on Broadway, and in motion pictures from 1905 to 1949. Five of the Marx Brothers' thirteen feature films were selected by the American Film Institute (AFI) as among the top 100 comedy films, with two of them (\"Duck Soup\" and \"A Night at the Opera\") in the top twelve. They are widely considered by critics, scholars, and fans to be among the greatest and most influential comedians of the 20th century. The brothers were included in AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars list of the 25 greatest male stars of Classic Hollywood cinema, the only performers to be inducted collectively.\n\nThe group is almost universally known today by their stage names: Chico, Harpo, Groucho, Gummo, and Zeppo. There was a 6th brother, the first born, named Manfred (Mannie), who died aged 7 months; Zeppo was given the middle name Manfred in his memory.\n\nThe core of the act was the three elder brothers: Chico, Harpo, and Groucho, each of whom developed a highly distinctive stage persona. After the group essentially disbanded in 1950, Groucho went on to begin a successful second career in television, while Harpo and Chico appeared less prominently. The two younger brothers, Gummo and Zeppo, never developed their stage characters to the same extent as the elder three. They each left the act to pursue business careers at which they were successful, and for a time ran a large theatrical agency through which they represented their brothers and others. Gummo was not in any of the movies; Zeppo appeared in the first five films in relatively straight (non-comedic) roles. The performing lives of the brothers owed much to their mother Minnie Marx, who acted as their manager until her death in 1929.\n\nThe Marx Brothers were born in New York City, the sons of Jewish immigrants from Germany and France. Their mother Miene \"Minnie\" Schoenberg (professionally known as Minnie Palmer, later the brothers' manager) was from Dornum in East Frisia, and their father Samuel (\"Sam\"; born Simon) Marx was a native of Alsace and worked as a tailor. (His name was changed to Samuel Marx, and he was nicknamed \"Frenchy\".) The family lived in the poor Yorkville section of New York City's Upper East Side, centered in the Irish, German and Italian quarters. The brothers are best known by their stage names:\n\nAnother brother, Manfred (\"Mannie\"), the first-born son of Sam and Minnie, was born in 1886 and died in infancy:\n\nThe Marx Brothers also had an older sister, actually a cousin, born in January 1885 who had been adopted by Minnie and Frenchie. Her name was Pauline, or \"Polly\". Groucho talked about her in his 1972 Carnegie Hall concert.\n\nMinnie Marx came from a family of performers. Her mother was a yodeling harpist and her father a ventriloquist; both were funfair entertainers. Around 1880, the family emigrated to New York City, where Minnie married Sam in 1884. During the early 20th century, Minnie helped her younger brother Abraham Elieser Adolf Schönberg (stage name Al Shean) to enter show business; he became highly successful on vaudeville and Broadway as half of the musical comedy double act Gallagher and Shean, and this gave the brothers an entree to musical comedy, vaudeville and Broadway at Minnie's instigation. Minnie also acted as the brothers' manager, using the name Minnie Palmer so that agents did not realize that she was also their mother. All the brothers confirmed that Minnie Marx had been the head of the family and the driving force in getting the troupe launched, the only person who could keep them in order; she was said to be a hard bargainer with theatre management.\n\nGummo and Zeppo both became successful businessmen: Gummo gained success through his agency activities and a raincoat business, and Zeppo became a multi-millionaire through his engineering business.\n\nThe brothers were from a family of artists, and their musical talent was encouraged from an early age. Harpo was particularly talented, learning to play an estimated six different instruments throughout his career. He became a dedicated harpist, which gave him his nickname. Chico was an excellent pianist, Groucho a guitarist and singer, and Zeppo a vocalist.\n\nThey got their start in vaudeville, where their uncle Albert Schönberg performed as Al Shean of Gallagher and Shean. Groucho's debut was in 1905, mainly as a singer. By 1907, he and Gummo were singing together as \"The Three Nightingales\" with Mabel O'Donnell. The next year, Harpo became the fourth Nightingale and by 1910, the group briefly expanded to include their mother Minnie and their Aunt Hannah. The troupe was renamed \"The Six Mascots\".\n\nOne evening in 1912, a performance at the Opera House in Nacogdoches, Texas, was interrupted by shouts from outside about a runaway mule. The audience hurried out to see what was happening. Groucho was angered by the interruption and, when the audience returned, he made snide comments at their expense, including \"Nacogdoches is full of roaches\" and \"the jackass is the flower of Tex-ass\". Instead of becoming angry, the audience laughed. The family then realized that it had potential as a comic troupe. (However, in his autobiography \"Harpo Speaks\", Harpo Marx stated that the runaway mule incident occurred in Ada, Oklahoma. A 1930 article in the \"San Antonio Express\" newspaper stated that the incident took place in Marshall, Texas.)\n\nThe act slowly evolved from singing with comedy to comedy with music. The brothers' sketch \"Fun in Hi Skule\" featured Groucho as a German-accented teacher presiding over a classroom that included students Harpo, Gummo, and Chico. The last version of the school act was titled \"Home Again\" and was written by their uncle Al Shean. The \"Home Again\" tour reached Flint, Michigan in 1915, where 14-year-old Zeppo joined his four brothers for what is believed to be the only time that all five Marx Brothers appeared together on stage. Gummo then left to serve in World War I, reasoning that \"anything is better than being an actor!\" Zeppo replaced him in their final vaudeville years and in the jump to Broadway, and then to Paramount films.\nDuring World War I, anti-German sentiments were common, and the family tried to conceal its German origin. Mother Minnie learned that farmers were excluded from the draft rolls, so she purchased a poultry farm near Countryside, Illinois — but the brothers soon found that chicken ranching was not in their blood. During this time, Groucho discontinued his \"German\" stage personality.\n\nBy this time, \"The Four Marx Brothers\" had begun to incorporate their unique style of comedy into their act and to develop their characters. Both Groucho's and Harpo's memoirs say that their now-famous on-stage personae were created by Al Shean. Groucho began to wear his trademark greasepaint mustache and to use a stooped walk. Harpo stopped speaking onstage and began to wear a red fright wig and carry a taxi-cab horn. Chico spoke with a fake Italian accent, developed off-stage to deal with neighborhood toughs, while Zeppo adopted the role of the romantic (and \"peerlessly cheesy\", according to James Agee) straight man.\n\nThe on-stage personalities of Groucho, Chico, and Harpo were said to have been based on their actual traits. Zeppo, on the other hand, was considered the funniest brother offstage, despite his straight stage roles. He was the youngest and had grown up watching his brothers, so he could fill in for and imitate any of the others when illness kept them from performing. \"He was so good as Captain Spaulding [in \"Animal Crackers\"] that I would have let him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience,\" Groucho recalled. (Zeppo stood in for Groucho in the film version of \"Animal Crackers\". Groucho was unavailable to film the scene in which the Beaugard painting is stolen, so the script was contrived to include a power failure, which allowed Zeppo to play the Spaulding part in near-darkness.) In December 1917 the Marx brothers were noted in an advertisement playing in a musical comedy act \"Home Again\".\n\nBy the 1920s, the Marx Brothers had become one of America's favorite theatrical acts, with their sharp and bizarre sense of humor. They satirized high society and human hypocrisy, and they became famous for their improvisational comedy in free-form scenarios. A famous early instance was when Harpo arranged to chase a fleeing chorus girl across the stage during the middle of a Groucho monologue to see if Groucho would be thrown off. However, to the audience's delight, Groucho merely reacted by commenting, \"First time I ever saw a taxi hail a passenger\". When Harpo chased the girl back in the other direction, Groucho calmly checked his watch and ad-libbed, \"The 9:20's right on time. You can set your watch by the Lehigh Valley.\"\n\nThe brothers' vaudeville act had made them stars on Broadway under Chico's management and with Groucho's creative direction—first with the musical revue \"I'll Say She Is\" (1924–1925) and then with two musical comedies: \"The Cocoanuts\" (1925–1926) and \"Animal Crackers\" (1928–1929). Playwright George S. Kaufman worked on the last two and helped sharpen the brothers' characterizations.\n\nOut of their distinctive costumes, the brothers looked alike, even down to their receding hairlines. Zeppo could pass for a younger Groucho, and played the role of his son in \"Horse Feathers\". A scene in \"Duck Soup\" finds Groucho, Harpo, and Chico all appearing in the famous greasepaint eyebrows, mustache, and round glasses while wearing nightcaps. The three are indistinguishable, enabling them to carry off the \"mirror scene\" perfectly.\n\nThe stage names of the brothers (except Zeppo) were coined by monologist Art Fisher during a poker game in Galesburg, Illinois, based both on the brothers' personalities and Gus Mager's \"Sherlocko the Monk\", a popular comic strip of the day that included a supporting character named \"Groucho\". As Fisher dealt each brother a card, he addressed him, for the very first time, by the names they kept for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe reasons behind Chico's and Harpo's stage names are undisputed, and Gummo's is fairly well established. Groucho's and Zeppo's are far less clear. Arthur was named Harpo because he played the harp, and Leonard became Chico (pronounced \"Chick-o\") because he was, in the slang of the period, a \"chicken chaser\". (\"Chickens\"—later \"chicks\"—was period slang for women. \"In England now,\" said Groucho, \"they were called 'birds'.\")\n\nIn his autobiography, Harpo explained that Milton became Gummo because he crept about the theater like a gumshoe detective. Other sources reported that Gummo was the family's hypochondriac, having been the sickliest of the brothers in childhood, and therefore wore rubber overshoes, called gumshoes, in all kinds of weather. Still others reported that Milton was the troupe's best dancer, and dance shoes tended to have rubber soles. Groucho stated that the source of the name was Gummo wearing galoshes. Whatever the details, the name relates to rubber-soled shoes.\n\nThe reason that Julius was named Groucho is perhaps the most disputed. There are three explanations:\n\n\nI kept my money in a 'grouch bag'. This was a small chamois bag that actors used to wear around their neck to keep other hungry actors from pinching their dough. Naturally, you're going to think that's where I got my name from. But that's not so. Grouch bags were worn on manly chests long before there was a Groucho.\n\n\nHerbert was not nicknamed by Art Fisher, since he did not join the act until Gummo had departed. As with Groucho, three explanations exist for Herbert's name \"Zeppo\":\n\n\nMaxine Marx reported in \"The Unknown Marx Brothers\" that the brothers listed their \"real\" names (Julius, Leonard, Adolph, Milton, and Herbert) on playbills and in programs, and only used the nicknames behind the scenes, until Alexander Woollcott overheard them calling one another by the nicknames. He asked them why they used their real names publicly when they had such wonderful nicknames, and they replied, \"That wouldn't be dignified.\" Woollcott answered with a belly laugh. Woollcott did not meet the Marx Brothers until the premiere of \"I'll Say She Is\", which was their first Broadway show, so this would mean that they used their real names throughout their vaudeville days, and that the name \"Gummo\" never appeared in print during his time in the act. Other sources reported that the Marx Brothers went by their nicknames during their vaudeville era, but briefly listed themselves by their given names when \"I'll Say She Is\" opened because they were worried that a Broadway audience would reject a vaudeville act if they were perceived as low class.\n\nThe Marx Brothers' stage shows became popular just as motion pictures were evolving to \"talkies\". They signed a contract with Paramount Pictures and embarked on their film career at Paramount's studios in New York City's Astoria section. Their first two released films (after an unreleased short silent film titled \"Humor Risk\") were adaptations of the Broadway shows \"The Cocoanuts\" (1929) and \"Animal Crackers\" (1930). Both were written by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind. Production then shifted to Hollywood, beginning with a short film that was included in Paramount's twentieth anniversary documentary, \"The House That Shadows Built\" (1931), in which they adapted a scene from \"I'll Say She Is\". Their third feature-length film, \"Monkey Business\" (1931), was their first movie not based on a stage production.\n\n\"Horse Feathers\" (1932), in which the brothers satirized the American college system and Prohibition, was their most popular film yet, and won them the cover of \"Time\" magazine. It included a running gag from their stage work, in which Harpo produces a ludicrous array of props from inside his coat, including a wooden mallet, a fish, a coiled rope, a tie, a poster of a woman in her underwear, a cup of hot coffee, a sword; and, just after Groucho warns him that he \"can't burn the candle at both ends,\" a candle burning at both ends.\n\nDuring this period Chico and Groucho starred in a radio comedy series, \"Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel\". Though the series was short lived, much of the material developed for it was used in subsequent films. The show's scripts and recordings were believed lost until copies of the scripts were found in the Library of Congress in the 1980s. After publication in a book they were performed with Marx Brothers impersonators for BBC Radio.\n\nTheir last Paramount film, \"Duck Soup\" (1933), directed by the highly regarded Leo McCarey, is the highest rated of the five Marx Brothers films on the American Film Institute's \"100 years ... 100 Movies\" list. It did not do as well financially as \"Horse Feathers\", but was the sixth-highest grosser of 1933. The film sparked a dispute between the Marxes and the village of Fredonia, New York. \"Freedonia\" was the name of a fictional country in the script, and the city fathers wrote to Paramount and asked the studio to remove all references to Freedonia because \"it is hurting our town's image\". Groucho fired back a sarcastic retort asking them to change the name of their town, because \"it's hurting our picture.\"\n\nAfter expiration of the Paramount contract Zeppo left the act to become an agent. He and brother Gummo went on to build one of the biggest talent agencies in Hollywood, helping the likes of Jack Benny and Lana Turner get their starts. Groucho and Chico did radio, and there was talk of returning to Broadway. At a bridge game with Chico, Irving Thalberg began discussing the possibility of the Marxes joining Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. They signed, now billed as \"Groucho, Chico, Harpo, Marx Bros.\"\n\nUnlike the free-for-all scripts at Paramount, Thalberg insisted on a strong story structure that made the brothers more sympathetic characters, interweaving their comedy with romantic plots and non-comic musical numbers, and targeting their mischief-making at obvious villains. Thalberg was adamant that scripts include a \"low point\", where all seems lost for both the Marxes and the romantic leads. He instituted the innovation of testing the film's script before live audiences before filming began, to perfect the comic timing, and to retain jokes that earned laughs and replace those that did not. Thalberg restored Harpo's harp solos and Chico's piano solos, which had been omitted from \"Duck Soup\".\n\nThe first Marx Brothers/Thalberg film was \"A Night at the Opera\" (1935), a satire on the world of opera, where the brothers help two young singers in love by throwing a production of \"Il Trovatore\" into chaos. The film—including its famous scene where an absurd number of people crowd into a tiny stateroom on a ship—was a great success, and was followed two years later by an even bigger hit, \"A Day at the Races\" (1937), in which the brothers cause mayhem in a sanitarium and at a horse race. The film features Groucho and Chico's famous \"Tootsie Frootsie Ice Cream\" sketch. In a 1969 interview with Dick Cavett, Groucho said that the two movies made with Thalberg were the best that they ever produced. Despite the Thalberg films' success, the brothers left MGM in 1937; Thalberg had died suddenly on September 14, 1936, two weeks after filming began on \"A Day at the Races\", leaving the Marxes without an advocate at the studio.\n\nAfter a short experience at RKO (\"Room Service\", 1938), the Marx Brothers returned to MGM and made three more films: \"At the Circus\" (1939), \"Go West\" (1940) and \"The Big Store\" (1941). Prior to the release of \"The Big Store\" the team announced they were retiring from the screen. Four years later, however, Chico persuaded his brothers to make two additional films, \"A Night in Casablanca\" (1946) and \"Love Happy\" (1949), to alleviate his severe gambling debts. Both pictures were released by United Artists.\n\nFrom the 1940s onward Chico and Harpo appeared separately and together in nightclubs and casinos. Chico fronted a big band, the Chico Marx Orchestra (with 17-year-old Mel Tormé as a vocalist). Groucho made several radio appearances during the 1940s and starred in \"You Bet Your Life\", which ran from 1947 to 1961 on NBC radio and television. He authored several books, including \"Groucho and Me\" (1959), \"Memoirs of a Mangy Lover\" (1964) and \"The Groucho Letters\" (1967).\n\nGroucho and Chico briefly appeared in a 1957 color short film promoting \"The Saturday Evening Post\" entitled \"Showdown at Ulcer Gulch,\" directed by animator Shamus Culhane, Chico's son-in-law. Groucho, Chico, and Harpo worked together (in separate scenes) in \"The Story of Mankind\" (1957). In 1959, the three began production of \"Deputy Seraph\", a TV series starring Harpo and Chico as blundering angels, and Groucho (in every third episode) as their boss, the \"Deputy Seraph.\" The project was abandoned when Chico was found to be uninsurable (and incapable of memorizing his lines) due to severe arteriosclerosis. On March 8 of that year, Chico and Harpo starred as bumbling thieves in \"The Incredible Jewel Robbery\", a half-hour pantomimed episode of the \"General Electric Theater\" on CBS. Groucho made a cameo appearance—uncredited, because of constraints in his NBC contract—in the last scene, and delivered the only line of dialogue (\"We won't talk until we see our lawyer!\").\nAccording to a September 1947 article in \"Newsweek\", Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo all signed to appear as themselves in a biopic entitled \"The Life and Times of the Marx Brothers\". In addition to being a non-fiction biography of the Marxes, the film would have featured the brothers reenacting much of their previously unfilmed material from both their vaudeville and Broadway eras. The film, had it been made, would have been the first performance by the Brothers as a quartet since 1933.\n\nThe five brothers made only one television appearance together, in 1957, on an early incarnation of \"The Tonight Show\" called \"Tonight! America After Dark\", hosted by Jack Lescoulie. Five years later (October 1, 1962) after Jack Paar's tenure, Groucho made a guest appearance to introduce the \"Tonight Show's\" new host, Johnny Carson.\n\nAround 1960, the acclaimed director Billy Wilder considered writing and directing a new Marx Brothers film. Tentatively titled \"A Day at the U.N.\", it was to be a comedy of international intrigue set around the United Nations building in New York. Wilder had discussions with Groucho and Gummo, but the project was put on hold because of Harpo's ill-health and abandoned when Chico died in 1961. He was 74. Three years later, on September 28, 1964, Harpo died at the age of 75 of a heart attack one day after heart surgery.\n\nIn 1966 Filmation produced a pilot for a Marx Brothers cartoon. Groucho's voice was supplied by Pat Harrington Jr. and other voices were done by Ted Knight and Joe Besser.\n\nIn 1970, the four Marx Brothers had a brief reunion of sorts in the animated ABC television special \"The Mad, Mad, Mad Comedians\", produced by Rankin-Bass animation (of \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" fame). The special featured animated reworkings of various famous comedians' acts, including W. C. Fields, Jack Benny, George Burns, Henny Youngman, the Smothers Brothers, Flip Wilson, Phyllis Diller, Jack E. Leonard, George Jessel and the Marx Brothers. Most of the comedians provided their own voices for their animated counterparts, except for Fields and Chico Marx (both had died), and Zeppo Marx (who had left show business in 1933). Voice actor Paul Frees filled in for all three (no voice was needed for Harpo). The Marx Brothers' segment was a reworking of a scene from their Broadway play \"I'll Say She Is\", a parody of Napoleon that Groucho considered among the brothers' funniest routines. The sketch featured animated representations, if not the voices, of all four brothers. Romeo Muller is credited as having written special material for the show, but the script for the classic \"Napoleon Scene\" was probably supplied by Groucho.\n\nOn January 16, 1977, the Marx Brothers were inducted into the Motion Picture Hall of Fame. With the deaths of Gummo in April 1977, Groucho in August 1977, and Zeppo in November 1979, the brothers were gone. But their impact on the entertainment community continues well into the 21st century.\n\nMany television shows and movies have used Marx Brothers references. \"Animaniacs\" and \"Tiny Toons\", for example, have featured Marx Brothers jokes and skits. Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) on \"M*A*S*H\" occasionally put on a fake nose and glasses, and, holding a cigar, did a Groucho impersonation to amuse patients recovering from surgery. Early episodes also featured a singing and off-scene character named Captain Spaulding as a tribute.\n\nBugs Bunny impersonated Groucho Marx in the 1947 cartoon \"Slick Hare\" (with Elmer Fudd dressing up as Harpo and chasing him with a cleaver) and in a later cartoon he again impersonated Groucho hosting a TV show called \"You Beat Your Wife,\" asking Elmer Fudd if he had stopped beating his wife. Tex Avery's cartoon \"Hollywood Steps Out\" (1941) featured appearances by Harpo and Groucho. They appeared, sometimes with Chico and Zeppo caricatured, in cartoons starring Mickey Mouse, Flip the Frog and others. In the \"Airwolf\" episode 'Condemned', four anti-virus formulae for a deadly plague were named after the four Marx Brothers.\n\nIn \"All in the Family\", Rob Reiner often did imitations of Groucho, and Sally Struthers dressed as Harpo in one episode in which she (as Gloria Stivic) and Rob (as Mike Stivic) were going to a Marx Brothers film festival, with Reiner dressing as Groucho. Gabe Kaplan did many Groucho imitations on his sit-com \"Welcome Back, Kotter\" and Robert Hegyes sometimes imitated both Chico and Harpo on the show. In Woody Allen's film \"Hannah and Her Sisters\" (1986), Woody's character, after a suicide attempt, is inspired to go on living after seeing a revival showing of \"Duck Soup\". In \"Manhattan\" (1979), he names the Marx Brothers as something that makes life worth living. In an episode of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" Murray calls the new station owner at home late at night to complain when the song \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\" is cut from a showing of \"Animal Crackers\" because of the new owners' policy to cut more and more from shows to sell more ad time, putting his job on the line.\n\nIn \"Everyone Says I Love You\" (1996), Woody Allen and Goldie Hawn dress as Groucho for a Marx Brothers celebration in France, and the song \"Hooray for Captain Spaulding\", from \"Animal Crackers\", is performed, with various actors dressed as the brothers, striking poses famous to Marx fans. (The film itself is named after a song from \"Horse Feathers\", a version of which plays over the opening credits.)\n\nHarpo Marx appeared as himself in a sketch on \"I Love Lucy\" in which he and Lucille Ball reprised the mirror routine from \"Duck Soup\", with Lucy dressed up as Harpo. Lucy had worked with the Marxes when she appeared in a supporting role in an earlier Marx Brothers film, \"Room Service\". Chico once appeared on \"I've Got a Secret\" dressed up as Harpo; his secret was shown in a caption reading, \"I'm pretending to be Harpo Marx (I'm Chico)\". The Marx Brothers were spoofed in the second act of the Broadway Review \"A Day in Hollywood/A Night in the Ukraine\".\n\nIn the 1989 film \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\", Professor Henry Jones (Sean Connery) mails his diary to his son Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) to keep it out of Nazi hands. When Indy misconstrues the purpose of being sent it and returns it to his father instead, his father berates him by saying \"I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers!\".\n\nIn the 1996 musical, By Jeeves, based on the Jeeves stories by P.G. Wodehouse, during \"The Hallo Song\", Gussie Fink-Nottle suggests \"You're either Pablo Picasso\", to which Cyrus Budge III replies \"or maybe Harpo Marx!\"\n\nIn Rob Zombie's 2003 film House of 1000 Corpses, the clown Captain Spaulding is named after the Marx brothers character, and this is mentioned in the movie.\n\nFilms with the four Marx Brothers:\n\nFilms with the three Marx Brothers (post-Zeppo):\n\nSolo endeavors:\n\nIn the 1974 Academy Awards telecast, Jack Lemmon presented Groucho with an honorary Academy Award to a standing ovation. The award was also on behalf of Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo, whom Lemmon mentioned by name. It was one of Groucho's final major public appearances. \"I wish that Harpo and Chico could be here to share with me this great honor,\" he said, naming the two deceased brothers (Zeppo was still alive at the time). Groucho also praised the late Margaret Dumont as a great straight woman who never understood any of his jokes.\n\nThe Marx Brothers were collectively named #20 on AFI's list of the Top 25 American male screen legends of Classic Hollywood. They are the only group to be so honored.\n\nThe \"Sweathogs\" of the ABC-TV series \"Welcome Back Kotter\" (John Travolta, Robert Hegyes, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, and Ron Palillo) patterned much of their on-camera banter in that series after the Marx Brothers. Series star Gabe Kaplan was reputedly a big Marx Brothers fan.\n\n\n\n"}

It is in effect a miniature version of stained-glass and is considered very challenging technically: high time consumption (up to 4 months per item), with a high failure rate. The technique is similar to that of cloisonné, but using a temporary backing that after firing is dissolved by acid or rubbed away. A different technique relies solely on surface tension, for smaller areas. In Japan the technique is known as shotai-jippo (shotai shippo), and is found from the 19th century on.\n\nThe technique was developed in the Byzantine Empire in 6th century AD. Some examples of Byzantine plique-à-jour survived in Georgian icons. The technique of plique-à-jour was adopted by Kievan Russia (strong trading partner of Constantinople) with other enamel techniques. Despite its complexity plique-à-jour tableware (especially \"kovsh\" bowls) was used by its aristocracy. Russian masters significantly developed plique-à-jour technique: in addition to cells cut in precious metal they worked with cells made of silver wire. Unfortunately the plique-à-jour technique of Kievan Russia was lost after the crushing Mongol invasion in the 13th century. Some surviving examples are exhibited in the Historical Museum in Moscow.\n\nWestern Europe adopted the plique-à-jour technique (cells cut in metal) of Byzantium. The term 'smalta clara' (\"clear enamel\"), probably meaning \"plique à jour\" appears in 1295 in the inventory of Pope Boniface VIII and the French term itself appears in inventories from the 14th century onwards. Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571) gives a full description of the process in his Treatises of Benvenuto Cellini on Gold-smithing and Sculpture of 1568. Pre-19th century pieces are extremely rare because of their \"extreme fragility ... which increases greatly with their size\", and the difficulty of the technique. Survivals \"are almost exclusively small ornamental pieces\". The outstanding early examples that survive are \"the decorative insets in the early fifteenth-century Mérode Cup (Burgundian cup) at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, a Swiss early sixteenth-century plique-a-jour enamel plaque representing the family of the Virgin Mary in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the eight pinnacle points over the front of the eleventh-century Saint Stephen's Crown in Hungary\". The technique was lost in both Western and Eastern Europe.\n\nThe technique was revived in the late 19th century movement of revivalist jewellery, and became especially popular in Russia and Scandinavia. Works by Pavel Ovchinikov, Ivan Khlebnikov, and some masters working for Faberge are real masterpieces of plique-à-jour. Russian masters predominately worked with tableware. Norwegian jewellers included David Andersen and J. Tostrup in Oslo, and Martin Hummer in Bergen. Art nouveau artists such as René Lalique. and other French and German artists predominantly used plique-à-jour in small jewellery, though the Victoria & Albert Museum has a tray of 1901 by Eugene Feuillâtre (1870–1916). \n\nCurrently plique-à-jour still not often used because it is challenging technically and mainly due to break in transferring of skills between generations of jewelers. Although some luxury houses (Tiffany in jewellery, Bulushoff in jewellery and tableware) produce limited numbers of products in plique-à-jour technique. Works in shotai shippo technique are also known from China and Iran.\n\nThere are four basic ways of creating plique-a-jour:\n\n1. Filigree plique-a-jour (\"Russian plique-a-jour\"): This is a building up process whereby a planned design is interpreted using gold or silver wires which are worked over a metal form (i.e. bowl). Wires are twisted or engraved, e.g. have additional micro patterns. The wires are soldered together. Enamels are ground and applied to each \"cell\" created by the metal wirework. The piece is fired in a kiln. This process of placing and firing the enamels is repeated until all cells are completely filled. Usually it takes up to 15-20 repeats.\n\n2. Pierced plique-a-jour (\"Western plique-a-jour\"): A sheet of gold or silver is pierced and sawed, cutting out a desired design. This leaves empty spaces or \"cells\" to fill with enamel powders (ground glass).\n\n3. Shotai shippo (\"Japanese plique-a-jour\"): A layer of flux (clear enamel) is fired over a copper form. Wires are fired onto the flux (similar to cloisonné) and the resulting areas are enameled in the colors of choice. When all the enameling is finished, the copper base is etched away leaving a translucent shell of plique-a-jour.\n\n4. Cloisonné on mica: Cells in precious metal are covered with fixed mica, which is stitched out with abrasives after enameling.\n\n"}
{"id": "18993927", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18993927", "title": "Popular culture", "text": "Popular culture\n\nPopular culture (also called pop culture) is generally recognized by members of a society as a set of the practices, beliefs and objects that are dominant or ubiquitous in a society at a given point in time. Popular culture also encompasses the activities and feelings produced as a result of interaction with these dominant objects. Heavily influenced in modern times by mass media, this collection of ideas permeates the everyday lives of people in a given society. Therefore, popular culture has a way of influencing an individual's attitudes towards certain topics. However, there are various ways to define pop culture. Because of this, popular culture is considered an empty conceptual category, or something that can be defined in a variety of conflicting ways by different people across different contexts. It is generally defined in contrast to other forms of culture such as folk culture, working-class culture, or high culture, and also through different theoretical perspectives such as psychoanalysis, structuralism, postmodernism, and more. The most common pop-culture categories are: entertainment (such as movies, music, television and video games), sports, news (as in people/places in the news), politics, fashion/clothes, technology, and slang.\n\nPopular culture is sometimes viewed by many people as being trivial and \"dumbed down\" in order to find consensual acceptance from (or to attract attention amongst) the mainstream. As a result, it comes under heavy criticism from various non-mainstream sources (most notably from religious groups and from countercultural groups) which deem it superficial, consumerist, sensationalist, or corrupt.\n\nThe term \"popular culture\" was coined in the 19th century or earlier. Traditionally, popular culture was associated with poor education and the lower classes, as opposed to the \"official culture\" and higher education of the upper classes. \nVictorian era Britain experienced social changes that resulted in increased literacy rates, and with the rise of capitalism and industrialisation, people began to spend more money on entertainment. Labelling penny dreadfuls the Victorian equivalent of video games, \"The Guardian\" described penny fiction as “Britain’s first taste of mass-produced popular culture for the young.” A growing consumer culture and an increased capacity for travel via the invention of railway (the first public railway, Stockton and Darlington Railway, opened in north-east England in 1825) created both a market for cheap popular literature, and the ability for it to be circulated on a large scale. The first penny serials were published in the 1830s to meet this demand.\n\nThe stress in the distinction from \"official culture\" became more pronounced towards the end of the 19th century, a usage that became established by the interbellum period.\n\nFrom the end of World War II, following major cultural and social changes brought by mass media innovations, the meaning of popular culture began to overlap with those of mass culture, media culture, image culture, consumer culture, and culture for mass consumption. Social and cultural changes in the United States were a pioneer in this with respect to other western countries.\n\nThe abbreviated form \"pop\" for popular, as in pop music, dates from the late 1950s. Although terms \"pop\" and \"popular\" are in some cases used interchangeably, and their meaning partially overlap, the term \"pop\" is narrower. Pop is specific of something containing qualities of mass appeal, while \"popular\" refers to what has gained popularity, regardless of its style.\n\nAccording to author John Storey, there are six definitions of popular culture. The quantitative definition of culture has the problem that much \"high culture\" (e.g., television dramatizations of Jane Austen) is also \"popular.\" \"Pop culture\" is also defined as the culture that is \"left over\" when we have decided what high culture is. However, many works straddle the boundaries, e.g., William Shakespeare and Charles Dickens.\n\nA third definition equates pop culture with \"mass culture\" and ideas. This is seen as a commercial culture, mass-produced for mass consumption by mass media. From a Western European perspective, this may be compared to American culture. Alternatively, \"pop culture\" can be defined as an \"authentic\" culture of the people, but this can be problematic as there are many ways of defining the \"people.\" Storey argued that there is a political dimension to popular culture; neo-Gramscian hegemony theory \"... sees popular culture as a site of struggle between the 'resistance' of subordinate groups in society and the forces of 'incorporation' operating in the interests of dominant groups in society.\" A postmodernist approach to popular culture would \"no longer recognize the distinction between high and popular culture.\"\n\nStorey claims that popular culture emerged from the urbanization of the Industrial Revolution. Studies of Shakespeare (by Weimann, Barber, or Bristol, for example) locate much of the characteristic vitality of his drama in its participation in Renaissance popular culture, while contemporary practitioners like Dario Fo and John McGrath use popular culture in its Gramscian sense that includes ancient folk traditions (the commedia dell'arte for example).\n\nPopular culture is constantly evolving and occurs uniquely in place and time. It forms currents and eddies, and represents a complex of mutually interdependent perspectives and values that influence society and its institutions in various ways. For example, certain currents of pop culture may originate from, (or diverge into) a subculture, representing perspectives with which the mainstream popular culture has only limited familiarity. Items of popular culture most typically appeal to a broad spectrum of the public. Important contemporary contributions for understanding what popular culture means have been given by the German researcher Ronald Daus, who studies the impact of extra-European cultures in North America, Asia, and especially in Latin America.\n\nAdaptations based on traditional folklore provide a source of popular culture. This early layer of cultural mainstream still persists today, in a form separate from mass-produced popular culture, propagating by word of mouth rather than via mass media, e.g. in the form of jokes or urban legend. With the widespread use of the Internet from the 1990s, the distinction between mass media and word-of-mouth has become blurred.\n\nAlthough the folkloric element of popular culture engages heavily with the commercial element, the public has its own tastes and it may not always embrace every cultural or subcultural item sold. Moreover, beliefs and opinions about the products of commercial culture spread by word-of-mouth, and become modified in the process and in the same manner that folklore evolves.\n\nMany people say that popular culture is a tool that higher ranking people in a society and elites (who often control mass media and popular culture outlets) use to control the people below them in society. It's also said that popular culture dulls the minds of the \"common man\", making them more passive and easier to control, although popular culture can also be used as a means of rebellion against the ways and culture of dominant subcultures.\n\nSources of popular culture include:\n\nFilms started massive popular culture. \n\nA television program is a segment of audiovisual content intended for broadcast (other than a commercial, trailer, or other content not serving as attraction for viewership).\n\nTelevision programs may be fictional (as in comedies and dramas), or non-fictional (as in documentary, news and reality television). It may be topical (as in the case of a local newscast and some made-for-television movies), or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series). They can be primarily instructional or educational, or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows.\n\nPopular music is music with wide appeal that is typically distributed to large audiences through the music industry. These forms and styles can be enjoyed and performed by people with little or no musical training. It stands in contrast to both art music and traditional or \"folk\" music. Art music was historically disseminated through the performances of written music, although since the beginning of the recording industry, it is also disseminated through recordings. Traditional music forms such as early blues songs or hymns were passed along orally, or to smaller, local audiences.\n\nSports include all forms of competitive physical activity or games which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants, and in some cases, entertainment for spectators.\n\nCorporate branding refers to the practice of promoting the brand name of a corporate entity, as opposed to specific products or services.\n\n"}

Most Public Analysts are also Agricultural Analysts who carry out similar work on animal feedingstuffs and fertilisers. Nowadays this includes checking that the food labelling is accurate. They also test drinking water, and may carry out chemical and biological tests on other consumer products. While much of the work is done by other scientists and technicians in the laboratory, the Public Analyst has legal responsibility for the accuracy of the work and the validity of any opinion expressed on the results reported. There is an Association of Public Analysts, which includes members with similar roles if different titles in other countries.\n\nThe office of Public Analyst was established in 1860, with the Act for Preventing the Adulteration of Articles of Food and Drink, the first three appointments being in London, Birmingham and Dublin. Since the separation of the UK and Ireland, they operate under different legislation, but the term and general duties are the same. The original work was chemical testing, and this is still a major part, but nowadays microbiological examination of food is an important activity, particularly in Scotland, where Public Analyst laboratories also carry out a statutory Food Examiner role.\n\nThe primary UK legislation is the Food Safety Act 1990. All local authorities are required to appoint a Public Analyst, although there have always been fewer Public Analysts and their laboratories than local authorities, most being shared by a number of local authorities. On the UK mainland there has always been a mixture of public sector and private sector laboratories. This remains the case today - but they all provide an equivalent service, and avoidance of conflicts of interest are ensured by the statutory terms of appointment. There is a statutory qualification requirement for Public Analysts, known as the Mastership in Chemical Analysis (MChemA), awarded by the Royal Society of Chemistry. This is a specialist postgraduate qualification by examination that verifies knowledge and understanding of food and its potential defects, interpretation of food law, and the application and interpretation of chemical analysis for food law enforcement.\n\nThe Public Analysts’ laboratories must be third-party accredited to British Standard ISO 17025.\n\nIn the mid 1980s there were some 40 Public Analyst Laboratories in the UK with over 100 appointed Public Analysts. By 1993 that had reduced to 34 Laboratories and around 80 Public Analysts, and by 2010 the number of Public Analyst Laboratories in the UK had reduced to 22 with only about 26 Public Analysts.\n\nEnforcement of food law in the UK is by local authorities, principally their environmental health officers and trading standards officers. Whilst these officers are empowered to take samples of food, the actual assessment in terms of chemical analysis or microbiological examination and subsequent interpretation that are necessary to determine whether a food complies with legislation is carried out by Public Analysts and Food Examiners respectively, scientists whose qualifications and experience are specified by regulations.\n\nPublic Analyst Laboratories in Cork, Dublin and Galway provide an analytical service to the Food Safety Authority.\n\nThe Public Analyst runs a laboratory which will:\n\nIn addition to their central rôle in relation to food law enforcement, Public Analysts provide expert scientific support to local authorities and the private sector in various other areas, for example they:\n\nSampling is largely outside the control of the Public Analyst.\n\nLocal authorities have a duty to check the safety of food and to provide adequate protection of the consumer. To achieve that they devise sampling plans, seeking to balance their need to monitor food against limited resources and other demands on their budgets. A typical sampling plan for a local authority might include samples of the following:\n\n\n"}

In 2009 the 17 stories collected in \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\" were published in their manuscript form, prior to Gordon Lish's extensive editing, under the title \"Beginners\".\n\nRaymond Carver's complete published works are collected in the following volumes:\n\n\nTwo texts which are not included in any of the collections above were published separately:\n\nCarver's 306 poems are collected in \"All Of Us\" (1996) after previously appearing in the collections: \"Near Klamath\" (1968), \"Winter Insomnia\" (1970), \"At Night The Salmon Move\" (1976), \"Fires\" (1983), \"Where Water Comes Together With Other Water\" (1985),\n\"This Water\" (1985), \"Ultramarine\" (1986), \"Early For The Dance\" (1986), \"Those Days: Early Writings By Raymond Carver: Eleven Poems And A Story\" (1987), \"In A Marine Light: Selected Poems\" (1987), \"A New Path To The Waterfall\" (1989), and \"No Heroics, Please\" (1991).\n\nNotable poems include \"Photograph of My Father in His Twenty-Second Year\", which grew out of the essay \"My Father's Life\", and \"Gravy\", which was published in \"The New Yorker\" in August 1988 following Carver's death. The poems \"Late Fragment\" and \"Gravy\" are both inscribed on his tombstone.\n\n\n\nCarver's first publication was in the Chico State student newspaper, \"The Wildcat\", on October 31, 1958. His contribution was a letter to the editor entitled \"Where Is Intellect?\", which complained about the apathy of students on campus. In 1962, Carver wrote an absurdist one-act play entitled \"Carnations\", which was staged on his college's campus on May 11 and received mostly negative feedback. The play was published in 1992 by Engdahl Typography.\n\nA fragment of Carver's unfinished novel \"The Augustine Notebooks\" was published in \"Iowa Review\" (Summer 1979), and later collected in \"Call If You Need Me\" (2000) and \"Collected Stories\" (2009). Additionally, Carver had accepted an advance on an unwritten novel from McGraw-Hill and planned to write a novel he imagined as \"an \"African Queen\" sort of thing\" set in German East Africa after World War I. Carver later admitted he stopped working on the novel after two weeks, and it appears that nothing of it exists beyond the published fragment.\n\nIn 1982, Carver was approached by director Michael Cimino with the idea of reworking a screenplay on the life of Fyodor Dostoevsky. Carver asked Tess Gallagher to assist him in the project. The movie was never produced but the screenplay, entitled \"Dostoevsky\", was published by Capra (Santa Barbara, 1985).\n\nCarver served as the founding editor of the Chico State literary magazine \"Selection\" in 1960 and the UC Santa Cruz journal \"Quarry\" (later \"Quarry West\") in 1971. He also edited the Spring 1963 issue of \"Toyon\" at Humboldt State. Carver also selected the contents for the book \"Syracuse Poems and Stories 1980\" (Syracuse, N.Y.: Department of English, Syracuse University, 1980). He also selected, along with Shannon Ravenel, the stories included in \"The Best American Short Stories 1986\" (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1986) and edited \"American Short Story Masterpieces\" (New York: Delacorte Press, 1987) with Tom Jenks.\n\n"}

{"id": "57971639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57971639", "title": "Spiritism (book)", "text": "Spiritism (book)\n\nSpiritism () is an 1885 book by German philosopher Eduard von Hartmann, the author of the famous treatise \"Philosophy of the Unconscious.\" In professor Corinna Treitel's opinion, publication of this book became one of the \"key events\" in history of the \"German occult movement.\" This book was \"one of the first works to attempt a complete psychological explanation of all occult phenomena.\" According to Charles Massey, one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research, publication of this book made the \"most brutal blow\" out of all ones that were ever directed against Spiritualism.\n\n\nAt the beginning of the first chapter Hartmann explains that \"the word 'Spiritism' is of French production\" but the English, and most part of the Germans prefer the term \"Spiritualism.\" The author presents to use the term \"Spiritualism\" to denote the metaphysical point of view, which is the opposite of materialism, and the explanation of mediumistic phenomena through participation of \"spirits\", he offers to call by the term \"Spiritism.\" He believes that most people, who are aspiring for Spiritism and read Spiritist journals, have no interest in a scientific study of the phenomena of mediumship, but instead seek \"the confirmation of their belief in immortality.\" Hartmann considers a reopening of the huge field of phenomena, that were rejected in the Age of Enlightenment, as a great merit of the modern spiritistic movement. However, in his opinion, Spiritism threatens to become a public disaster in Germany, therefore the state should use its authority in order to interest scientists in a study of the spiritistic phenomena. He writes that the public has the complete right to know about these things, and since it is not able to formulate its own opinion, it only remains to wait for the conclusions drawn by the official representatives of science.\n\nHartmann writes that in order to study the \"abnormal phenomena of human nature\" it is necessary to appeal to persons who are endowed with an abnormal organism. It should be remembered, he continues, that just as in \"experiments with an electrical friction machine\", there may be failures in experiments with mediums, but this should not prevent the \"investigation of abnormal phenomena.\" He believes that the scientific study of spiritism should be based on \"general methodological axioms\" which can not be \"transgressed with impunity.\"\n\"First, principles are not to be multiplied without necessity; thus a second sort of causes are not to be supposed, as long as a single sort will suffice. Secondly, we should as long as possible abide by causes whose existence is guaranteed by experience or indubitable inference, and should not unnecessarily catch at causes of doubtful or unproven existence, such as are to be first established by their value as hypothesis for the explanation of phenomena in question. Thirdly, we should as long as possible try to do with natural causes and not touch supernatural ones without urgent necessity. Against these three axioms Spiritism offends.\"\n\nThe study of \"masked somnambulism,\" as Hartmann argues, can give an understanding of the \"whole area\" of mediumistic phenomena. He explains that an \"universal medium must be more than autosomnambule; he must be at the same time a powerful magnetiser.\" In his opinion, on a spiritistic séance medium plunges itself into a state of \"masked or open somnambulism.\" Further, such a medium-autosomnambule has hallucinations, considered by him for reality, and at the same time, he possesses a strong desire that those present should see this imaginary reality, i.e. would have the same hallucinatory ideas as he himself.\n\nHartmann believes that \"from the scientific psychological standpoint\" every participator of mediumistic séance must constantly think on himself that he is under the influence of a very powerful mesmerist who aims to immerse him in masked somnambulism and thus taint him with his hallucinations.\n\"The mediums in their state of masked or open somnambulism have a size of nerve force, be it self-produced or extracted and accumulated by those present, as no magnetiser in his waking state has made it unfold, so surely theirs ability must with the help of this superior quantity of force to put those present in a state of open or masked somnambulism, greater than that of any magnetiser acting in the awake state.\"\nAccording to Hartmann, the waking will of the medium in the somnambulic state fulfills the function of a magnetiser, giving the somnambulic consciousness a certain direction in relation to emerging hallucinations. If a medium \"has the hallucination\" of no longer being itself but of being the \"spirit of Katie King,\" for example, and of appearing as such, the hallucination will also be transmitted to the recipients, that the medium who emerges from the curtain really is \"Katie King.\" He believes that materialisation is most often just a transfiguration of medium himself, because when the phantom was separating from the medium it always appeared that it was completely coming from the medium and returning to him.\n\nThe hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann rejects the possibility of obtaining photographs on which both the medium and the materialised figure would be simultaneously placed, since hallucination can not be photographed, thus, in the opinion of its author, all such photographs are fake. For example, about a photograph taken by William Crookes, on which can seen the medium simultaneously with the phantom, Hartmann writes that it is exposed to the strong suspicion that \"instead of the supposed phantom the medium, and instead of the supposed medium the dress of the medium, stuffed with a cushion in a half-concealed position, have been photographed.\"\n\nAccording to Hartmann, any physical phenomena of mediumship, regardless of their complexity, are always fulfilled due to \"mediumistic nerve force,\" which is nothing else than a physical force that is \"produced\" by medium's nervous system and passes unhindered through any substance, \"like magnetism.\" The medium's will must direct this force and control the one, and the distribution of the one depends on the \"fantastic image that is in the somnambulistic conscious of the medium.\" In addition, physical phenomena that require \"a special strain of nerve force\" are occurring when mediums sink into \"an open somnambulism.\" The author confirms that the imprints of organic forms belong to \"the most striking phenomena\" of mediumship—they had been surpassed only cases of \"matter's penetration through matter.\" He admits that the imprints undoubtedly prove that in this case there is no transfer of hallucinations but \"an objective-real impact of mediumistic force on matter,\" and explains this phenomenon as follows:\n\"If we imagine another arrangement of the pressure and tension lines of the mediumistic nerve force—an arrangement corresponding to those pressures that are produced by inner side of the flat laying hand on a soft substance capable of perceiving the imprint, then the movement of the particles of matter caused by such a dynamical system should again be consistented with that, which is caused by direct pressure of the hand, i.e. imprint of an organic form would have been obtained, although such a form, capable of producing such imprint, might not has been in material kind.\"\n\nSome of the phenomena Hartmann explains by the fact that medium in a state of somnambulism allegedly combines \"the hallucination of the emerging image\" with the idea on the need to move a real object and unconsciously produces this displacement \"with the help of his mediumistic nerve force,\" while remaining confident that it was performed by own force of the fantastic image that has appeared by him, that is, through the \"transfer of his hallucination to the audience,\" he unconsciously inspires them with the idea that the displacement that occurred really was fulfilled by that ghost which is just his hallucination.\n\nRegarding spiritistic messages, Hartmann argues that only \"the somnambulistic consciousness\" can be the source of their content. He writes, \"All messages have a content corresponding to the mental level and views of the medium.\" As a rule, this level happens to be \"below the spiritual level\" of the medium and participants of the séance, less often it equals, but it happens to be never higher.\n\nThe author writes that some mediums, with their \"mimic transfigurations\", exhibit striking linguistic abilities. They can reproduce words and phrases \"in strange, incomprehensible dialects\", which they had previously accidentally heard without paying attention to this. According to Hartmann, only a medium, who can write, can \"produce automatic writing or perform writing at a distance [without the involvement of the hand].\"\n\nIn principle, Hartmann admits the possibility of a mediumistic phenomenon of \"the penetration of matter\", as well as allows for the possibility of all other phenomena confirmed by the testimony of witnesses. However, he opposes the hypothesis by German astronomer Zöllner about the fourth dimension of space, preferring, rather, the statement \"on the molecular shakes of material bonds in the body, than the one on movements and vibrations outside of three-dimensional space.\" According to Hartmann, neither the sack nor the cage in which the medium can be contained will not be a hindrance to him: if he can pass through a substance in a state of sleep, \"nothing prevents him from appearing as a phenomenon in front of the audience, in spite of all these precautions.\"\n\nAfter the mentioning to the \"expansive action\" of the mediumistic nerve force that overcomes the \"cohesion of material particles\" and leads to acoustic phenomena, Hartmann proceeds to spiritistic phenomena related to \"penetration of matter\", classifying them as \"an especially incredible field of phenomena.\" He refers to the confirmed experiments of Zöllner and the facts of \"a transference\" of objects into a locked room, which repeatedly observed under the most stringent conditions of control. He lists various types of \"the penetration of matter\": the passing an iron ring through the hand of a medium, penetration of coins, slate-pencils, etc. in completely closed boxes, the inserting a ring on the table's leg, the tying of knots on ropes and belts with \"sealed\" ends, the bringing into the séance's room the items from another room or other houses, as well as bringing of flowers which were growing outside the room.\n\nAccording to Hartmann, medium can't by only his will or by his purely psychological influence, cause the above-mentioned physical phenomena in inanimate objects. The main action of the will is a release the \"mediumistic nerve force\" out the nervous system and its directing with a certain way on the living or dead objects. Nevertheless, according to him, in the study of any phenomena of mediumism, with the exception of clairvoyance, there is no need to go \"beyond the bounds of the natural explanations.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Hartmann assesses the central idea of spiritism:\n\"Thus the whole hypothesis of spirits has dissolved into pure nothingness, after first the direct physical power, then the production of the phenomena of materialisation, and finally production of the ideality of the manifestations, have shifted from the presupposed spirits to the mediums. Whether there are spirits or not, we do not have to examine here; in any case, if there are any, they are referred back to that other world from which Spiritualism believed them to have sunk into this world.\"\n\nOne of the most active critics of Hartmann's book was Alexander Aksakov. The proofs which Aksakov used to \"disprove Hartmann's hallucination hypothesis\" were the photographs of spirits. The pictures \"taken during the séances, in which both the medium and the materialised form were visible,\" were convincingly demonstrating, according to Aksakov, that materialisation is \"an objective phenomenon\", and not a kind the mass hypnosis (see the photo on the left). Criticism by Aksakov was supported in the publications of occultists in the journal , where \"Hartmann was portrayed variously as obtuse or dishonest for his refusal to recognise his logical errors.\" Aksakov has been emphasizing that Hartmann had no practical experience and did not pay enough attention to those facts that did not correspond to his convictions, and many phenomena were \"completely unknown\" to him.\n\nProfessor wrote that Hartmann uses his hypotheses, according to how it is more convenient to him: if a materialised figure appears on séance, then for him it is just a hallucination imagined by the participators of the séance; if this phantom is displayed in the photo, then its appearance is explained by the action of the mediumistic nerve force, since otherwise it could not be photographed. But the view arbitrarily using such unstable explanations is \"scientifically untenable.\" Commenting on Hartmann's statement that imprints of the organic forms are produced by the mediumistic nerve force, Aksakov wrote that this hypothesis necessarily leads to \"the acceptance of the length, thickness, and density\" of this force, in other words, to that which usually serves to define the body, thus such imprints should be produced \"by the action of an invisible body formed with help of the medium,\" that is, by the materialised form. Hartmann also speaks that mediumistic nerve force \"can cause thermal and light phenomena,\" for example, it can produce certain forms, \"at least inorganic ones: crosses, stars, a bright field with light points shimmering on it.\" Hence, here, according to Aksakov's commentary, the nerve force becomes visible and does not constitute a hallucination. Why then does the same force that has become visible in a materialized organic image, sometimes in a luminous one, turns into a hallucination? According to Aksakov, the hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann is destroyed \"by his own logic.\"\n\nIn connection with the hypothesis of the author, explaining the physical phenomena of mediumship, Massey noted that \"the opinion of most persons conversant with them will be that Hartmann's hypothesis is too complicated in itself, and even thus is unadequate to the facts.\" Karl Du Prel brought such Hartmann's statement from the first chapter of his book: \"Since I never attended a séance myself, I am not in a condition to form a judgment on the reality of the phenomena in question... On the other hand, I hold myself at any rate competent to offer a conditional judgment on the conclusions to be drawn from these phenomena in case of their reality, for this is peculiarly the office of the philosopher.\" Then he commented on this passage as follows:\n\"I must admit, I always believed that there is 'a golden rule for the philosopher'—to remain silent where he has no experience, so that no one could be told: 'Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses!' (If you had been silent, you would have remained a philosopher!) That is why my final verdict lies in the fact that Hartmann, with his writings against spiritism, has certainly contributed to eristic but not in philosophy.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "349487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=349487", "title": "Staples thesis", "text": "Staples thesis\n\nIn economic development, the staples thesis is a theory of export-led growth based on Canadian experience. The theory \"has its origins in research into Canadian social, political, and economic history carried out in Canadian universities...by members of what were then known as departments of political economy\". From these groups of researchers, \"the two most prominent scholars following this approach were Harold Innis and W.A. Mackintosh\".\n\nThe thesis explains Canadian economic development as a lateral, east-west conception of trade. Innis argued that Canada developed as it did because of the nature of its staple commodities: raw materials, such as fish, fur, lumber, agricultural products and minerals, that were exported to Britain and the West Indies. This trading link cemented Canada's cultural links to Britain. The search for and exploitation of these staples led to the creation of institutions that defined the political culture of the nation and its regions.\n\nInnis argues that different staples led to the emergence of regional economies (and societies) within Canada. For instance, the staple commodity in Atlantic Canada was cod. This industry was very decentralized, but also very co-operative. In western Canada the central staple was wheat. Wheat farming was a very independent venture, which led to a history of distrust of government and corporations in that part of the country. (Also important, however, were the shocks caused by volatility in the market for wheat and by the weather itself on the growing season.) In Central Canada, the main staple was fur, and the fur trade dominated the economy for many years. This fur trade was controlled by large firms, such as the Hudson's Bay Company and thus produced the much more centralized, business-oriented society that today characterizes Montreal and Toronto.\n\nInnis depicted the relationship between regions of Canada as one of \"heartland\" to \"hinterland\":The periphery, or hinterland, is dominated by the core, or heartland. Because the heartland was dependent upon the search for and accumulation of staples (which were located in the hinterland) to perpetuate the economy, it sought to gain economic and political power by exploiting the hinterland.\n\nTo Innis, it was the fur trade that created the geographical boundaries of Canada. The early links between the Canadian interior and eastern ports led to Canadian unity and its distinctiveness from the United States. However, the importance of fur as a staple product also resulted in the northern half of the continent remaining dependent on Britain for trade and thus essentially British for so much of its history.\n\nMel Watkins revived the theory during the 1960s and 1970s through his work on resource capitalism and Canadian political economy. While the staples thesis originally described the evolution of the Canadian state, it has since been used to study the economies of many nations that are dependent upon resource extraction and primary industries.\n\nThe staples thesis states that export of raw materials can sustain economic growth, while its critics argue that reliance on commodity export should not delay the development of basic manufacturing and provision of services. Among his strongest critics was Robin Neill who advocated a post-Innisian thesis, explaining the economic development of Canada as an expression of variegated regions (population density, cultural politics, geographic characteristics) and of their particular north-south relationships with the United States.\n\nHistorians continue to use elements of the Innis Core-periphery model, applying it for example to British Columbia. That province's economic structure exemplifies the \"core-periphery\" structure of intra-regional relationships. The core is metropolitan Vancouver, with its concentration of corporate management and transportation functions and manufacturing growth. It dominates an underdeveloped periphery that depends on production and export of staple commodities.\n\n"}

{"id": "12319832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12319832", "title": "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen", "text": "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\n\nTransformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a 2009 American science fiction action film directed by Michael Bay and based on the Transformers toy line. It is the sequel to 2007's \"Transformers\", as well as the second installment in the live-action \"Transformers\" film series. Taking place two years after its predecessor, the plot revolves around Sam Witwicky, who is caught in the war between two factions of alien robots, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons, led by Megatron. Sam is having strange visions of Cybertronian symbols, and being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named The Fallen, who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an energon source, destroying the Sun and all life on Earth in the process. Returning Transformers include Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, Megatron, Starscream, and Scorponok.\n\nWith deadlines jeopardized by possible strikes by the Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild, Bay managed to finish the production on time with the help of previsualization and a scriptment by his writers David Marconi, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and series newcomer Ehren Kruger. Shooting took place from May to November 2008, with locations in Egypt, Jordan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and California, as well as air bases in New Mexico and Arizona. This was the last film in the series to star Megan Fox, and was also the last film in the series to be co-produced by DreamWorks Pictures, leaving Paramount Pictures as the sole distributor of its future films, starting with \"\".\n\n\"Revenge of the Fallen\" premiered on June 8, 2009 in Tokyo and was released on June 24, 2009 in the United States. Critical reception was widely negative, and the film is considered inferior to the first film. Metacritic said the film received \"generally unfavorable reviews\"; the Rotten Tomatoes consensus says it is \"a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch\". The film won three Golden Raspberry Awards at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony and became the highest-grossing film to win the Worst Picture award. The film surpassed its predecessor at the box office, grossing a total of $402.1 million in the US and Canada and $434.2 million in other territories, for a total of $836.3 million worldwide. It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2009, 32nd domestically and fourth-highest of the year worldwide. With over 11 million home media sales in 2009, it was also the top-selling film of the year in the United States. It was followed by \"\" in 2011, \"\" in 2014, and \"\" in 2017.\n\nIn 17,000 B.C., the Seven Primes travel across the universe to create Energon with star-absorbing machines called Sun Harvesters, which destroy stars in order to collect their raw material. One of them later known as \"The Fallen\", defies their rule to never to destroy planets with life by establishing a Sun Harvester on Earth. He is confronted by, the other Primes, who imprison the Fallen before he can harvest the planet's Sun using the Matrix of Leadership. The rest of the Primes then sacrifice themselves to hide the Matrix in an unknown location.\nIn the present, two years after Megatron's defeat, the Autobots and the U.S. military have formed the Non-biological Extraterrestrial Species Treaty (NEST), a classified international task force used to eliminate the surviving Decepticons. In Shanghai, the Autobots intercept two Decepticons, Demolisher and Sideways. Sideways is killed by the Autobot Sideswipe, while Optimus Prime kills Demolisher, but not before he warns them of the Fallen's return. At NEST's secure headquarters in Diego Garcia, National Security Adviser Theodore Galloway concludes the Decepticons are still on Earth to hunt the Autobots, since Megatron's corpse is at the bottom of the Laurentian Abyss and the last-known AllSpark shard is secured in the base. Soundwave hacks into a military satellite, overhears the information, and sends Ravage to retrieve the shard.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam Witwicky is preparing to attend college, leaving his girlfriend Mikaela Banes and guardian Bumblebee behind. He finds a smaller AllSpark shard and picks it up, causing him to see Cybertronian symbols. As a side effect, the shard's energy brings various kitchen appliances to life, who then attack Sam and his family. After Bumblebee kills the living appliances, Sam gives the shard to Mikaela, who later captures Decepticon Wheelie when he attempts to steal it. The Constructicons resurrect Megatron by brutally ripping apart the Constructicon Scrapmetal to provide parts for him, as well as using the stolen shard. Megatron then travels to one of Saturn's moons, where he reunites with his master, the Fallen, who orders him to capture Sam alive and kill Optimus, as he is the only Transformer who can defeat the Fallen. After killing Alice, a Decepticon Pretender disguised as a college student, Sam, Mikaela and his college roommate, Leo are captured by the Decepticon Grindor and taken to an abandoned factory. Megatron reveals that the symbols in Sam's mind will lead the Decepticons to a new Energon source before Optimus and Bumblebee arrive to rescue the trio. Optimus engages Megatron, Starscream, and Grindor; though Optimus injures Starscream by cutting his arm off and killing Grindor, Megatron kills Optimus by impaling him through the chest, destroying his spark. The other Autobots arrive and repel the Decepticons, forcing Megatron and Starscream to retreat. The Decepticons launch devastating simultaneous attacks around the world, destroying ships in the Second Fleet and damaging Paris. The Fallen hijacks Earth's telecommunications systems, demanding that Sam be handed to him. \n\nSam, Mikaela, and Leo enlist the help of former Sector Seven agent, Seymour Simmons, who reveals that the Transformers visited Earth eons ago and the most ancient, known as Seekers, remained on Earth, hiding in secret. With help from Wheelie, they track down a Decepticon Seeker named at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. They use their shard to revive Jetfire, who teleports the group to Egypt and explains the story of the Fallen. Jetfire and Wheelie turn against the Decepticons, and order them to locate the Matrix, which could revive Optimus. Sam's group finds the Matrix in Petra, but it disintegrates into dust in Sam's hands. Undeterred, Sam stuffs the Matrix's remains into his sock.\nMeanwhile, NEST forces and the Autobots land near the Giza pyramid complex but are attacked by a large force of Decepticons. During the battle, many Constructicons combine to form Devastator, who destroys one of the pyramids to reveal the Sun Harvester inside, before he is killed by a destroyer's railgun called in by Simmons. Ravage and the Decepticon Rampage attempt to spring a trap with Sam's captured parents as bait, in order to force Sam to give them the Matrix, but Bumblebee interferes and kills them both. Major William Lennox and Master Sergeant Robert Epps call in an airstrike, which kills the majority of the Decepticon ground forces. However, Megatron manages to shoot Sam, seemingly killing him, before retreating upon getting attacked. Nearing his death, the Primes contact Sam through a vision, telling him the Matrix is earned, not found, and that he earned the right to bear it. They restore Sam's life and the Matrix, which he uses to revive Optimus.\nThe Fallen teleports to their location and steals the Matrix from Optimus, then returns to the pyramid with Megatron and activates the Sun Harvester. Jetfire, who was gravely wounded during the battle by Scorponok but did manage to kill his attacker, sacrifices himself in order to transplant his parts to Optimus, which give him immense strength and the ability to fly. Optimus knocks the Fallen and Megatron off the pyramid, destroying the Sun Harvester in the process. In the battle, Optimus disables Megatron and kills the Fallen; vowing vengeance, Megatron retreats with Starscream. The victorious Autobots and their allies then return to the United States as Sam resumes to attend to college.\n\n\n\n\nSeveral clones of Scrapper, Mixmaster, Bonecrusher, Long Haul and Rampage are seen during the final battle in Egypt. An unnamed Decepticon bulldozer and dump truck, possibly clones of Rampage and Long Haul, were seen combining to form Devastator's left hand and left leg, respectively.\n\nMajor hurdles for film's initial production stages included the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike as well as the threat of strikes by other guilds. Prior to a potential Directors Guild of America strike, Bay began creating animatics of action sequences featuring characters rejected for the 2007 film. This would allow animators to complete sequences if the Directors Guild of America went on strike in July 2008, which ultimately did not happen. Bay considered making a small project in between \"Transformers\" and its sequel, but decided against the idea, saying \"you have your baby and you don't want someone else to take it\".\n\nScreenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who had written the first film, originally passed on the opportunity to write a sequel due to schedule conflicts. The studio began courting other writers in May 2007, but were unimpressed with other pitches and eventually convinced Orci and Kurtzman to return. The studio also hired Ehren Kruger, who had impressed Bay and Hasbro president Brian Goldner with his knowledge of the \"Transformers\" mythology. The writing trio were paid $8 million. Screenwriting was interrupted by the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, but to avoid production delays, the writers spent two weeks writing a treatment, which they handed in the night before the strike began. Bay then expanded the outline into a 60-page scriptment, which included more action, humor, and characters. The three writers spent four months finishing the screenplay while \"locked\" in two hotel rooms by Bay; Kruger wrote in his own room and the trio would check on each other's work twice a day.\n\nOrci described the film's theme as \"being away from home\", with the Autobots contemplating living on Earth as they cannot restore Cybertron, while Sam goes to college. He wanted the focus between the robots and humans \"much more evenly balanced\", \"the stakes [to] be higher\", and more focused on the science fiction elements. Orci added he wanted to \"modulate\" the humor more, and felt he managed the more \"outrageous\" jokes by balancing them with a more serious plot approach to the \"Transformers\" mythology. Bay concurred that he wanted to please fans by making the tone darker, and that \"mums will think it[']s safe enough to bring the kids back out to the movies.\" Two elements were added late into the film: the Autobot Jolt—as General Motors wanted to advertise the Chevrolet Volt—and the railgun that kills Devastator, a new acquisition by the U.S. Military.\n\nIn September 2007, Paramount announced a late June 2009 release date for the sequel to \"Transformers\". The film was given a $200 million budget, which was $50 million more than the first film, and some of the action scenes rejected for the original were written into the sequel. Producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura later stated the studio proposed filming two sequels simultaneously, but he and Bay agreed that the idea was not the right direction for the series.\n\nPrior to the first film's release, producer Tom DeSanto had \"a very cool idea\" to introduce the Dinobots, while Bay was interested in including an aircraft carrier, which was dropped from the 2007 film. Orci claimed they did not incorporate these characters into \"Revenge of the Fallen\" because they could not think of a way to justify the Dinobots' choice of form, and were unable to fit in the aircraft carrier. Orci also admitted he was dismissive of the Dinobots because he does not like dinosaurs, saying \"I recognize I am weird in that department.\" However, he became fonder of them during filming because of their popularity with fans. He added \"I couldn't see why a Transformer would feel the need to disguise himself in front of a bunch of lizards. Movie-wise, I mean. Once the general audience is fully on board with the whole thing, maybe Dinobots in the future.\" When asked on the subject, Michael Bay said he hated the Dinobots and they had never been in consideration for being featured in the movies.\n\nDuring production, Bay attempted to create a misinformation campaign to increase debate over what Transformers would be appearing in the film, as well as to try to throw fans off from the story of the film; however, Orci confessed it was generally unsuccessful. The studio went as far as to censor MTV and Comic Book Resources interviews with Mowry and Furman, who confirmed Arcee and The Fallen would be in the picture. Bay told \"Empire\" that Megatron would not be resurrected, claiming his new tank form was a toy-only character, only for Orci to confirm Megatron would return in the film in February 2009. Bay also claimed he faked the leaking of daily call sheets from the first week of filming, that revealed Ramón Rodríguez's casting, and the appearance of Jetfire and the twins.\n\nInspired by its use in Christopher Nolan's \"The Dark Knight\", three action sequences in \"Revenge of the Fallen\" were shot using IMAX cameras. Although screenwriter Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be 3D, Bay later said he found 3D too \"gimmicky\". Bay added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras.\n\nThe majority of interior scenes for the film were shot in the former Hughes Aircraft soundstages at Playa Vista. From June 2–4, the production filmed an action sequence at the Bethlehem Steel site in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, which was used to represent a portion of Shanghai. Afterwards, they shot at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. The crew moved to Philadelphia on June 9, where they shot at a defunct PECO Richmond power station, the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, the Eastern State Penitentiary, Fairmount Park, Philadelphia City Hall, Rittenhouse Square, historic Chancellor Street (which represents a street near Place de la Concorde in Paris), and Wanamaker's. The production moved to Princeton University on June 22. Filming there angered some students at the University of Pennsylvania, believing Bay had chosen to reshoot scenes at Princeton and script Princeton's name in the film. One shot that was filmed in the University of Pennsylvania was the party scene, filmed at what students call \"The Castle\". \"The Castle\" is home to the prestigious Psi Upsilon Fraternity. However, neither the University of Pennsylvania nor Princeton gave Bay permission to be named in the film because of a scene that both institutions felt \"did not represent the school\" in which Sam's mother ingests marijuana-laced brownies.\nBay scheduled a break for filming beginning on June 30, turning his attention to animation and second unit scenes because of the potential guild strike. Shooting for the Shanghai battle later continued in Long Beach, California. In September, the crew shot at Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. The two locations were used for Qatar in \"Transformers\" and stood in for Egypt in this film. A scale model in Los Angeles was also used for some close-ups of the pyramids. Shooting at Tucson International Airport and the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group's aircraft boneyard took place in October under the fake working title \"Prime Directive\" (a reference to \"Star Trek\"). Filming also took place at Camp Pendleton and Davis–Monthan Air Force Base.\n\nThe first unit then shot for three days in Egypt at the Giza pyramid complex and Luxor. The shoot was highly secretive, but according to producer Lorenzo di Bonaventura, a crew of 150 Americans and \"several dozen local Egyptians\" ensured a \"remarkably smooth\" shoot. Bay earned the Egyptian government's approval to film at the pyramids by contacting Zahi Hawass, whom Bay said \"put his arm around me and said, 'Don't hurt my pyramids. A camera crane was used at the location. Bay stated he found the climax of the first film to be weak, partly because it was shot across five different city blocks, making the action confusing and hard to follow. On this film, the final battle in Egypt was devised to make it easier to follow the action.\n\nFour days were then spent in Jordan; the Royal Jordanian Air Force aided in filming at Petra, Wadi Rum and Salt because King Abdullah II is a big fan of science fiction movies. Filming continued at the Place de la Concorde in Paris with second unit shots of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. The cast and crew finished principal photography on the aircraft carrier USS \"John C. Stennis\" on November 2, 2008.\n\nHasbro became more involved in the designs of the robots than the company was for \"Transformers\". The company, along with Takara Tomy, suggested to the filmmakers that combining robots be the main draw for the sequel. They insisted on keeping the alternate modes of some of the returning characters similar so that consumers would not have to buy toys of the same characters. Bay used real F-16 Fighting Falcon and tank fire when filming the battles. Many of the new Autobot cars supplied by General Motors were brightly colored to look distinctive on screen. \"Revenge of the Fallen\" features 46 robots, while the original movie had 14.\n\nScott Farrar returned as visual effects supervisor and anticipated moodier use of lighting as well as deeper roles for the Decepticons. He stated that with the bigger deadline, post-production would become a \"circus\". The producers expected that with a bigger budget and the special effects worked out, the Transformers would have a larger role. Peter Cullen recalled, \"Don Murphy mentioned to me, 'Only because of the tremendous expense to animate Optimus Prime, he'll be in just a certain amount of [\"Transformers\"].' But he said, 'Next time, if the movie is a success, you're gonna be in it a ton.'\" Michael Bay hoped to include more close-ups of the robots' faces. The heads had to be designed with more pieces in order to express emotions in a more convincing way. Farrar said the animators implemented more \"splashes and the hits and the fighting on dirt or moving, banging into trees, [...] things splinter and break, [the robots] spit, they outgas, they sweat, they snort.\" Shooting in the higher resolution of IMAX required up to 72 hours to render a single frame of animation. While ILM used 15 terabytes for \"Transformers\", they used 140 for the sequel. Particularly problematic effects were the lighting, with scenes such as Jetfire inside the Smithsonian requiring 41 light sources, and the destruction of the pyramid, which appears in about five shots and required seven months to simulate the behavior of the blocks. Orci hinted the majority of the Decepticons were entirely computer-generated in both robot and alternate modes, making it easier to write additional scenes for them in post-production. Rendering the Devastator took over 85% of ILM's render farm capacity, and the complexity of the scene and having to render it at IMAX resolution caused one computer to \"explode\".\n\nThe score to \"Revenge of the Fallen\" was composed by Steve Jablonsky, who reunited with director Michael Bay to record his score with a 71-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage. Jablonsky and his score producer Hans Zimmer composed various interpretations of a song by Linkin Park called \"New Divide\" for the score.\n\nAn additional $150 million was spent to market the film globally. Hasbro's included new molds of new and returning characters, as well as 2007 figures with new mold elements or new paint schemes. The first wave was released on May 30, although Bumblebee and Soundwave debuted beforehand. The second wave came in August 2009, which introduced toys such as 2¼-inch human action figures that fit inside the transforming robots, and non-transforming replicas of the cars that can be used on a race track. Product placement partners on the film include Burger King, 7-Eleven, LG phones, Kmart, Wal-Mart, YouTube, Nike, Inc. and M&M's, as well as Jollibee in the Philippines. General Motors' financial troubles limited its involvement in promotion of the sequel, although Paramount acknowledged with or without GM, their marketing campaign was still very large and had the foundation of the 2007 film's success. Kyle Busch drove a \"Revenge of the Fallen\" decorated car at Infineon Raceway on June 21, 2009, while Josh Duhamel drove a 2010 Camaro at the Indianapolis 500. At the movie's launch in China, a version of Bumblebee was constructed using a Volkswagen Jetta.\n\nChris Mowry and artist Alex Milne, who had collaborated on \"\" comic book, reunited for IDW Publishing's prequel to the film. Originally set to be a five-part series entitled \"Destiny\", it was split into two simultaneously published series, titled \"Alliance\" and \"Defiance\". \"Alliance\" is drawn by Milne and began in December 2008; it focuses on the human and Autobot perspectives. \"Defiance\", which started the following month, is drawn by Dan Khanna and is set before either film, showing the beginnings of the war.\n\nAfter the 2007 film, and serving as a bridge between the two films, Alan Dean Foster wrote \"\", originally titled \"Infiltration\". During the writing, Foster collaborated with IDW to make sure their stories did not contradict each other.\n\nThe first printed media directly related to the second film was a 32-page coloring and activity book by publisher HarperCollins, which became available on May 5, 2009 and was the first official source to openly give out key plot points to the film. On June 1, 2009 DK Publishing published a 96-page book entitled \"Transformers: The Movie Universe\", which intended to provide factual data on the characters of the film.\n\nOn June 10, 2009, the comic book adaptation of the film, written by Simon Furman was released. Additionally, Alan Dean Foster also wrote the novelization for the film. Meanwhile, Dan Jolley wrote \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: The Junior Novel\", a 144-page book oriented at a younger audience than the one by Foster. Lastly, a book titled \"Transformers: The Art of the Movies\" was released, documenting behind-the scenes aspects of the making of the film.\n\nOther minor tie-in publications include \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: The Last Prime\", \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: The Reusable Sticker Book\", \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Made You Look!\", \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Rise of the Decepticons\", \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Spot the 'Bots\", \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen: Mix and Match\", \"Operation Autobot\", \"When Robots Attack\" and \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen 2010 Wall Calendar\".\n\n\"Revenge of the Fallen\" video games are available on the following platforms:\n\n\"Revenge of the Fallen\" premiered on June 8, 2009 in Tokyo, Japan. After its UK release on June 19, 2009, it was released in regular and IMAX theaters in North America on June 24 (though some theaters held limited-access advance screenings on June 22). The IMAX release featured additional scenes of extended robot fighting sequences, which were not seen in the regular theatre version.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, \"Revenge of the Fallen\" has an approval rating of 19% based on 244 reviews and an average rating of 3.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" is a noisy, underplotted, and overlong special effects extravaganza that lacks a human touch.\" On Metacritic gave the film an average score of 35 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"generally unfavorable reviews\". In CinemaScore polls, however, users gave the film a \"B+\", compared to the \"A\" that the original film had scored. \n\nActor Shia LaBeouf was unimpressed with the film, stating \"We got lost. We tried to get bigger. It's what happens to sequels. It's like, how do you top the first one? You've got to go bigger. Michael Bay went so big that it became too big, and I think you lost the anchor of the movie...You lost a bit of the relationship. Unless you have those relationships, then the movie doesn't matter. Then it's just a bunch of robots fighting each other.\" Bay has admitted his disappointment with the film and has apologized, saying the film was \"crap\" and blaming the 2007–08 Writers' strike, saying \"It was very hard to put (the sequel) together that quickly after the writers' strike (of 2007–08)\". \n\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\", \"Revenge of the Fallen\" was Bay's worst-reviewed film at the time of release, faring even worse than \"Pearl Harbor\" (2001). Betsy Sharkey of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the film as \"in-your-face, ear-splitting and unrelenting. It's easy to walk away feeling like you've spent 2 hours in the mad, wild, hydraulic embrace of a car compactor\".\n\nRoger Ebert, who had given the 2007 film three stars, gave the sequel only one, calling it \"...a horrible experience of unbearable length\", a phrase which later became the title of his third bad-movie-reviews collection. Later in his review, Ebert discouraged movie-goers from seeing the film by saying \"If you want to save yourself the ticket price, go into the kitchen, cue up a male choir singing the music of hell, and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together. Then close your eyes and use your imagination.\" He later wrote on his blog about the film, \"The day will come when \"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" will be studied in film classes and shown at cult film festivals. It will be seen, in retrospect, as marking the end of an era. Of course there will be many more CGI-based action epics, but never again one this bloated, excessive, incomprehensible, long (149 minutes) or expensive ($200 million).\" Ebert would continue to lambast the film (and, sometimes, the \"Transformers\" franchise in general) in other movie reviews and responses to letters and emails sent to him. \"Rolling Stone\" critic Peter Travers did not give the film any stars, considering that \"\"Revenge of the Fallen\" has a shot at the title 'Worst Movie of the Decade'.\" Which he later did name it the \"worst film of the decade\". Other reviewers, while still critical, were less damning of the film, \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a \"C-\", complaining about the writing and length, but mentioning the effects and action scenes were impressive. Among positive reviews, Robbie Collin of \"News of the World\" remarked \"It's bigger. Badder. Boobier. And many other words beginning with B, including boneheadedly brilliant.\" Amy Biancolli of the \"Houston Chronicle\" called it \"a well-oiled, loudly revving summer action vehicle that does all that's required, and then some\", Jordan Mintzer from \"Variety\" said it \"takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence\", and Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" wrote that \"\"Revenge of the Fallen\" may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil. But it knows how to feed your inner 10-year-old's appetite for destruction.\"\n\nOn a year-end poll administered by Moviefone, the film was voted the \"worst film of 2009\", and Fox's performance the worst by an actress that year. Comcast ranked the film as the 4th-worst sequel of all time. \"Empire\" named the film the 25th-worst movie ever made. In June 2009, David Germain from the Associated Press called the film the \"worst-reviewed $400 million hit ever\".\nThere was considerable negative reaction to the characters Mudflap and Skids, who some perceived as embodying racist stereotypes. Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" said that \"the characters [...] indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas\". Critic Scott Mendelson said \"To say that these two are the most astonishingly racist caricatures that I've ever seen in a mainstream motion picture would be an understatement.\" Harry Knowles, founder of Ain't It Cool News, went further, asking his readers \"not to support this film\" because \"you'll be taking [your children] to see a film with the lowest forms of humor, stereotypes, and racism around.\" Bay (the director) has attempted to defend the film as \"good clean fun\" and insisted that \"We're just putting more personality in.\" Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman responded to the controversy with \"It's really hard for us to sit here and try to justify it. I think that would be very foolish, and if someone wants to be offended by it, it's their right. We were very surprised when we saw it, too, and it's a choice that was made. If anything, it just shows you that we don't control every aspect of the movie.\"\n\nAnother major complaint about the film was Bay's usage of the IMAX format. Instead of using IMAX for complete unbroken sequences similar to director Christopher Nolan's approach for \"The Dark Knight\", Bay chose to use the format primarily on a shot-by-shot basis, combining conventional 35mm footage and IMAX shots in the same sequence. That approach, combined with rapid cutting, created a jarring, highly unpleasant experience for most moviegoers.\n\nDespite mostly negative reviews from critics, the film was a box office success. \"Revenge of the Fallen\" grossed $16 million from midnight showings, at the time the most ever for a Wednesday midnight debut. The film proceeded to beat \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\"'s record ($44.2 million) for the biggest Wednesday opening in history, bringing in $62 million in total receipts on its first day (until \"\" topped this record with $68.5 million in 2010), additionally ranking it as the second biggest opening day ever at the time, behind \"The Dark Knight\". The film grossed $108.9 million on its first weekend, the seventh-largest in history at the time, and brought in $200 million in its first five days, putting it in second place behind \"The Dark Knight\"s $203.7 million for the all-time biggest five-day opening. Its gross from Friday to Sunday was also the biggest June opening weekend for one year, breaking \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\"'s record ($93.7 million), until \"Toy Story 3\" claimed that record the following year ($110.3 million).\n\n\"Revenge of the Fallen\" remained #1 at the box office for two weeks straight by a close margin. Initial studio estimates showed a tie between it and that weekend's new release \"\", but the actual totals showed \"Revenge of the Fallen\" taking the #1 spot yet again with $42.3 million. Also, it was the first film of 2009 to reach the $300 million mark in North America. On July 27, a month after its release, the movie reached $379.2 million in the US, which brought it into the top 10 highest-grossing movies ever in that country as of August 2009. \"Revenge of the Fallen\" closed its box office run with $402.1 million in the U.S. & Canada and $836.3 million worldwide, being the thirty-second-highest-grossing film of all time domestically, and the 84th-highest-grossing film of all time. Among 2009 films, it was the second-highest-grossing in the United States and Canada, behind \"Avatar\", and fourth globally behind \"Avatar\", \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", and \"Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs\". As of 2013, the film marks as the second-highest-grossing Hasbro film of all time, behind only its sequel \"\". Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 53 million tickets in the US.\n\nThe film was released in two-disc Blu-ray and DVD editions, and a single-disc DVD version on October 20, 2009 in North America. Michael Bay has revealed that the Blu-ray release of the film, produced by Charles de Lauzirika, features variable aspect ratio for the scenes shot in IMAX format. A special IMAX edition was available exclusively at Walmart.\nHome versions include over three hours of bonus content and several interactive features, including \"The AllSpark Experiment\", which reveals Michael Bay's plans for in the series. At Target, the DVD and Blu-ray versions includes a transformable Bumblebee case. Both two-disc editions are the first to include Paramount's Augmented Reality feature, which allows the user to handle a 3D model of Optimus Prime on a computer by moving the package in front of a webcam. First-week sales of the DVD reached 7.5 million copies, making it the best-selling DVD of 2009. The Blu-ray version had the best first-week sales of 2009, with 1.2 million units.\n\n\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\" was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on December 5, 2017.\n\n\"Revenge of the Fallen\" was among the films shortlisted for the Best Visual Effects at the 82nd Academy Awards, but was only nominated for Best Sound Mixing (Greg P. Russell, Gary Summers and Geoffrey Patterson), eventually losing to \"The Hurt Locker\". The film won five Scream Awards, for Best Actress (Megan Fox), Breakout Performance-Female (Isabel Lucas), Best Sequel, Best F/X, and Scream Song of the Year (\"New Divide\"); and two Teen Choice Awards, for Choice Summer Movie Star: Female (Megan Fox) and Choice Summer Movie Star: Male (Shia LaBeouf). \"Revenge of the Fallen\" was also nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film but lost to \"Avatar\", Satellite Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound, a VES Award for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Visual Effects Driven Feature Motion Picture, a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Stunt Ensemble, and an MTV Movie Award for Best WTF Moment (Isabel Lucas turning into a Decepticon). Shia LaBeouf, the film and Megan Fox was nominated for a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for Favorite Movie Actor, Favorite Movie and Favorite Movie Actress, but all lost to Taylor Lautner, \"\" and Miley Cyrus, respectively.\n\nOn the other hand, it was nominated for seven Razzie Awards including Worst Actress for Megan Fox (also for \"Jennifer's Body\"), Worst Supporting Actress for Julie White, Worst Screen Couple (for Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox) and Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, winning three in the Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay categories at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards.\n\nThe third film, \"Dark of the Moon\" was released June 29, 2011. The fourth film, \"Age of Extinction\" was released June 27, 2014. The fifth film, \"The Last Knight\" was released on June 21, 2017.\n\n"}
{"id": "2818958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2818958", "title": "Vardzia", "text": "Vardzia\n\nVardzia () is a cave monastery site in southern Georgia, excavated from the slopes of the Erusheti Mountain on the left bank of the Kura River, thirty kilometres from Aspindza. The main period of construction was the second half of the twelfth century. The caves stretch along the cliff for some five hundred meters and in up to nineteen tiers. The Church of the Dormition, dating to the 1180s during the golden age of Tamar and Rustaveli, has an important series of wall paintings. The site was largely abandoned after the Ottoman takeover in the sixteenth century. Now part of a state heritage reserve, the extended area of Vardzia-Khertvisi has been submitted for future inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List.\n\nSoviet-era excavations have shown that the area of Vardzia was inhabited during the Bronze Age and indicated the reach of Trialeti culture. Cave settlements such as Uplistsikhe are known along the Kura River from at least the fifth century BC, while rock cut architecture in the context of Georgian Christianity is known from Zedazeni and Garedzhi from the sixth century AD, and more locally from Vanis Kvabebi, Cholta and Margastani from the eighth century. Four distinct building phases have been identified at Vardzia: the first during the reign of Giorgi III (1156–1184), when the site was laid out and the first cave dwellings excavated; the second between his death and the marriage of his successor Tamar in 1186, when the Church of the Dormition was carved out and decorated; the third from that date until the Battle of Basian c.1203, during which time many more dwellings as well as the defences, water supply, and irrigation network were constructed; while the fourth was a period of partial rebuilding after heavy damage in the earthquake of 1283.\n\nA number of documentary sources supplement the knowledge derived from the site's physical fabric. The collection of chronicles known as the \"History of Georgia\" refers to Tamar erecting a church to house the icon of the Virgin of Vardzia after receiving divine help in her campaigns, before transferring the monastery from Upper or Zeda Vardzia. Tamar is said to have departed from Vardzia during her campaign against the Muslims, and her ensuing victory at Basian is celebrated in the \"Hymns in Honour of the Virgin of Vardzia\" by Ioane Shavteli. The \"History of Georgia\" also relates how Vardzia escaped the Mongol invaders in the 1290s. The Persian Safavid chronicler Hasan Bey Rumlu describes Vardzia as a \"wonder\", \"impregnable as the wall of Alexander the Great\", before recounting its sack by the Persians under Shah Tahmasp I in 1551; a near-contemporary note in the Vardzia Gospel tells of its repatriation from a Persian bazaar. After the arrival of the Ottomans in 1578, the monks departed and the site was abandoned.\n\nThe greater Vardzia area includes also the early eleventh-century church at Zeda Vardzia and the tenth- to twelfth-century rock village and cave churches of Ananauri. The main lower site was carved from the cliff's central stratum of tufaceous breccia at an elevation of thirteen hundred metres above sea level. It is divided into an eastern and a western part by the Church of the Dormition. In the eastern part of the complex are seventy-nine separate cave dwellings, in eight tiers and with a total of 242 rooms, including six chapels, \"Tamar's Room\", a meeting room, reception chamber, pharmacy, and twenty-five wine cellars; 185 wine jars sunk into the floor document the importance of viticulture to the monastic economy. In the western part, between the bell tower and the main church, are a further forty houses, in thirteen tiers and with a total of 165 rooms, including six chapels, a refectory with a bakery, other ovens for baking bread, and a forge. Beyond the bell tower the complex rises to nineteen tiers, with steps leading to a cemetery. Infrastructure includes access tunnels, water facilities, and provision for defence.\n\nThe Church of the Dormition was the central spiritual and monumental focus of the site. Carved similarly from the rock, its walls reinforced in stone, it measures by , rising to a height of . Both church and narthex are painted; these paintings are of \"crucial significance in the development of the Medieval Georgian mural painting\". Its patron, Rati Surameli, is commemorated in a donor portrait on the north wall; the accompanying inscription reads \"Mother of God, accept ... the offering of your servant Rati, \"eristavi\" of Kartli, who has zealously decorated this holy church to your glory\". On the same north wall are portraits of the royal founders, Giorgi III and Tamar; she lacks the ribbon that is the attribute of a married woman and her inscription includes the formula \"God grant her a long life\", while that of Giorgi does not; this helps date the paintings to between Giorgi's death in 1184 and Tamar's marriage in 1186. Episodes from the life of Christ occupy the vaults and upper walls in a sequence, starting with the Annunciation, followed by the Nativity, Presentation in the Temple, Baptism, Transfiguration, Raising of Lazarus, Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem, Last Supper, Washing of the Feet, Crucifixion, Harrowing of Hell, Ascension, Descent of the Holy Spirit, and Dormition (the church is sometimes known as the Church of the Assumption, which corresponds with the Orthodox Feast of the Dormition). At a lower level, more accessible as intercessors, are paintings of saints and stylites. On the rear wall of the sanctuary, behind the altar, are Twelve Church Fathers. In the narthex are scenes of the Last Judgment, Bosom of Abraham, Angels bearing a Medallion with the Cross, and three scenes from the life of Saint Stephen; other paintings were lost in the 1283 earthquake. The paintings are not frescoes, but executed in \"secco\", and \"testify to contacts with the Christian Orient and the Byzantine world, but applied using local artistic traditions\".\n\nSince 1985 the site has formed part of the Vardzia Historical–Architectural Museum-Reserve, which includes forty-six architectural sites, twelve archaeological sites, and twenty-one sites of monumental art. In 1999 Vardzia-Khertvisi was submitted for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List as a Cultural Site in accordance with criteria ii, iii, iv, v, and vi. In their evaluation, advisory body ICOMOS cited Göreme in Cappadocia as the closest amongst cave monastery sites of international significance. In 2007 Vardzia-Khertvisi was resubmitted as a mixed Cultural and Natural Site in accordance also with criterion vii. From 2012, conservation of the wall paintings in the Church of the Dormition is to be carried out by the Courtauld Institute of Art in conjunction with the National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia and Tbilisi State Academy of Arts. \n\n\n"}
