It is one of the first institutions of its kind in the United States to collect African American ethnic historical records and to document the modern Civil Rights Movement.\n\nThe ARC has approximately 15 million holdings, emphasizing documents, and also including books, pamphlets, periodicals, photographs, and fine arts. It additionally has digitized holdings to enable research and education by scholars and students at locations distant from the ARC. Although the ARC documents history and race relations in the United States its holdings extend beyond African-American history and also include the ethnic heritage of Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans, Appalachian whites, and the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe ARC traces its history to the events leading to the 1841 U.S. Supreme Court case United States v. The Amistad. The abolitionists who aided the Amistad Africans in their defense in that court case eventually helped to found the American Missionary Association (AMA), as an anti-caste, integrated abolitionist group. During and following the United States Civil War, the AMA founded hundreds of schools for the freedmen and other ethnic communities across the United States, including common schools, colleges and universities.\n\nThe AMA became a division within the Board of Home Missions of the Congregational Churches following a 1927 merger. It continued to work toward causes of civil rights, race relations, and the educational work of the church throughout the mergers of the Congregation, Christian, Evangelical and Reformed churches that occurred in 1931 and in 1956. It eventually fell under the umbrella of the United Church Boards of Homeland Ministries (UCBHM) of the United Church of Christ (UCC). As the AMA division's awareness of the problems of discrimination and segregation of African-Americans became evident, a two-day seminar on \"racialism\" was held at the Broadway Tabernacle Church in New York City in October 1941. The seminar was attended by AMA officers, presidents of the historically black colleges and universities, representatives of philanthropic organizations, and U.S. government officials. The results of the seminar was the establishment of the Race Relations Department of the UCBHM at Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee in 1942. The Amistad Research Center was established within the Race Relations Department to house the historical records of the American Missionary Association in 1966.\n\nClifton H. Johnson was appointed as director of the Race Relations Department in 1966 making him the ARC's first administrator. Johnson was a suitable choice for the ARC because of his experience with the AMA archives. He wrote his dissertation on the AMA while a doctoral candidate at the University of North Carolina, organized the AMA archives, and initiated a proposal to the AMA suggesting that they use their archives as a nucleus to collect primary documents on the history of ethnic minorities in the United States. Johnson's initial intent for Amistad Research Center was that it would supply primary resources for scholars interested in any aspect of African American history. The UCBHM eventually closed the Race Relations Department but chose to keep the ARC and it was incorporated into an independent non-profit archive in 1969.\n\nAfter incorporation in 1969, the first meeting of the ARC's board members was held in the New York City office of the AMA. Dr. Albert W. Dent, retired president of Dillard University, approached Johnson, with an open invitation from Dr. T.S. Lawless, chairman of the university's board of trustees, about moving the ARC to the campus of Dillard University. In 1970 the ARC moved to Dillard University. The university housed the ARC free of charge in its library with a promise to donate land for the construction of a permanent home on its campus. The funds for a new building at Dillard never crystallized and the Center was forced to seek a new location to house its collections that had grown beyond the space it occupied in Dillard's Library.\n\nThe Amistad Research Center moved to the New Orleans Mint in 1980 after its collection became too large for its space at Dillard University. The United States government had given the Old U.S. Mint building to the State of Louisiana, which in turn had given it to the Louisiana State Museum. Johnson reached agreement with the director of the museum about re-locating the ARC to the Old U.S. Mint building. The terms including renting the floor space to the ARC for $1 per year. The ARC spent $500,000 on renovations to the new space, anticipating that the Old U.S. Mint building could accommodate its collections for the next 15 years. Johnson underestimated the growth of the ARC's collections, and after five years the ARC ran out of space again. Johnson and the ARC's Board of Trustees searched for another location that would accommodate the institution in its continued growth.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the ARC was in need of adequate space and invitations came from various universities to house the ARC. Harvard University, Rutgers University, the University of North Carolina, the University of Georgia, Howard University, Hampton University, the University of Mississippi, Tulane University and Prairie View A&M sent delegations to make presentations to the ARC's board. There was strong opposition to both Mississippi and Tulane housing the Center because of their past histories of denying Black students admission to their schools. However, there was strong support from the local community to keep the Center in New Orleans. The local chapter of the Friends of Amistad collected hundreds of signatures from Black residents in favor of Tulane. Rosa Keller, Tulane University President Eamon Kelly, the Tulane University Board of Administrators, and New Orleans Mayor Ernest Morial advocated for the ARC to be located at Tulane University. The board voted to relocate to Tulane University, and the ARC has been on its campus in Uptown New Orleans since 1987. In 1996, Donald DeVore became the first African-American to serve as director of the ARC and the third director in its history.\n\nThe ARC has approximately 800 manuscript collections that document cultural movements, civil rights, race relations, education, politics, and art. It has 250,000 photographs dating from 1860 in various formats including tintypes and glass plate negatives. Microfilm holdings of collections at the ARC and from other repositories total approximately 14,000 reels. The moving image and sound recordings holdings include nearly 8,000 items on video and audiotape, motion picture film, phonographic and optical discs. Featured within the collections are oral histories with civil rights activists, community leaders, artists, and musicians. The Center also has archival materials related to W.E.B. DuBois, Mary McLeod Bethune, Langston Hughes, Alain Locke, Zora Neale Hurston, Homer Plessy, Frederick Douglass and Claude McKay.\n\nArchival and manuscript holdings include the papers and records of:\n\nThe ARC's library serves as a complement to the manuscripts collection and serves to document the ethnic experience in the United States by housing pamphlets, broadsides, reports, literary first and notable editions, newspapers and monographs related to its focus. The ARC contains a diverse collection of approximately 45,000 books including rare and first editions, more than 2,000 runs of periodicals dating from 1826, 1.5 million newspaper articles, and 30,000 pamphlets.\n\nIn addition to significant holdings in the area of African American literature, Amistad holds works from the personal libraries of authors Countee Cullen, Chester Himes, and Thomas Dent and a Comics and Graphic Novels Collection, in addition to a growing collection of zines. Of significance to the Amistad Case, the ARC's collections include Lewis Tappan's bound volume of contemporary pamphlets on the legal proceedings with his handwritten notes. Other highlights include 18th century slave ordinances in French Louisiana, an edition of Black Majesty by John W. Handercock with an unpublished handwritten poem titled \"Black Majesty\" by Countee Cullen on the title page verso, and Lewis Tappan's annotated copy of the 1839 edition of by Theodore Dwight Weld.\n\nThe ARC owns a significant collection of African American art consisting of approximately 400 works. Many of the artworks were a part of the collection formed by the William E. Harmon Foundation and include examples from the growing African American visual arts movement of the mid-twentieth century. The works fall within the traditional fine art categories of portraiture, landscape, and genre. Many of these are available in digital form.\n\nBecause of space limitations, the ARC's artworks are often displayed at major museums, including the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the DuSable Museum of African American History, El Museo del Barrio, and the Perez Art Museum Miami.\n\nAmong the prominent works in the collection are the 41 paintings in the Toussaint L'Ouverture series, completed in 1938 by Jacob Lawrence (1917–2000), a celebrated American artist of the 20th century. Toussaint was Lawrence's first series, completed when he was a 21 years old student. The paintings document the historic events of the Haitian Revolution.\n\nEllis Wilson's oil painting entitled Funeral Procession is a collection highlight, especially since it was the subject of an episode of a popular television show in the 1980s.\n\nThe ARC's art holdings include works from\n"}
{"id": "48203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48203", "title": "Article (grammar)", "text": "Article (grammar)\n\nAn article (with the linguistic glossing abbreviation ) is a word that is used with a noun (as a standalone word or a prefix or suffix) to specify grammatical definiteness of the noun, and in some languages extending to volume or numerical scope.\n\nThe articles in English grammar are \"the\" and \"a/an\", and in certain contexts \"some\". \"An\" and \"a\" are modern forms of the Old English \"an\", which in Anglian dialects was the number \"one\" (compare \"on\" in Saxon dialects) and survived into Modern Scots as the number \"owan\". Both \"on\" (respelled \"one\" by the Norman language) and \"an\" survived into Modern English, with \"one\" used as the number and \"an\" (\"a\", before nouns that begin with a consonant sound) as an indefinite article.\n\nIn many languages, articles are a special part of speech which with other parts of speech. In English grammar, articles are frequently considered part of a broader category called determiners, which contains articles, demonstratives (such as \"this\" and \"that\"), possessive determiners (such as \"my\" and \"his\"), and quantifiers (such as \"all\" and \"few\"). Articles and other determiners are also sometimes counted as a type of adjective, since they describe the words that they precede.\n\nIn languages that employ articles, every common noun, with some exceptions, is expressed with a certain definiteness, definite or indefinite, as an attribute (similar to the way many languages express every noun with a certain grammatical number—singular or plural—or a grammatical gender). Articles are among the most common words in many languages; in English, for example, the most frequent word is \"the\".\n\nArticles are usually categorized as either \"definite\" or \"indefinite\". A few languages with well-developed systems of articles may distinguish additional subtypes. Within each type, languages may have various forms of each article, due to conforming to grammatical attributes such as gender, number, or case. Articles may also be modified as influenced by adjacent sounds or words as in elision (e.g., French \"le\" becoming \"l'\" before a vowel), epenthesis (e.g., English \"a\" becoming \"an\" before a vowel), or contraction (e.g. Irish \"i + na\" becoming \"sna\").\n\nThe definite article is used to refer to a particular member of a group or class. It may be something that the speaker has already mentioned or it may be something uniquely specified. There is one definite article in English, for both singular and plural nouns: \"the\":\nThe sentence above refers to specific children and a specific way home; it contrasts with the much more general observation that:\nThe latter sentence refers to children in general and their specific ways home. Likewise,\nrefers to a specific book whose identity is known or obvious to the listener; as such it has a markedly different meaning from \nwhich uses an indefinite article, which does not specify what book is to be given.\n\nThe definite article can also be used in English to indicate a specific class among other classes:\nHowever, recent developments show that definite articles are morphological elements linked to certain noun types due to lexicalization. Under this point of view, definiteness does not play a role in the selection of a definite article more than the lexical entry attached to the article.\n\nAn \"indefinite\" article indicates that its noun is not a particular one identifiable to the listener. It may be something that the speaker is mentioning for the first time, or the speaker may be making a general statement about any such thing. \"a/an\" are the indefinite articles used in English. The form \"an\" is used before words that begin with a vowel sound (even if spelled with an initial consonant, as in \"an hour\"), and \"a\" before words that begin with a consonant sound (even if spelled with a vowel, as in \"a European\").\n\nBefore some words beginning with a pronounced (not silent) \"h\" in an unstressed first syllable, such as \"historic(al)\", \"hallucination\", \"hilarious\", \"horrendous\", and \"horrific\", some (especially older) British writers prefer to use \"an\" over \"a\" (\"an historical event\", etc.). \"An\" is also preferred before \"hotel\" by some writers of British English (probably reflecting the relatively recent adoption of the word from French, in which the \"h\" is not pronounced). The use of \"an\" before words beginning with an unstressed \"h\" is more common generally in British English than in American. American writers normally use \"a\" in all these cases, although there are occasional uses of \"an historic(al)\" in American English. According to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, such use is increasingly rare in British English too. Unlike British English, American English typically uses \"an\" before \"herb\", since the \"h\" in this word is silent for most Americans. The correct usage in respect of the term \"hereditary peer\" was the subject of an amendment debated in the UK Parliament.\nThe word \"some\" can be viewed as functionally a plural of \"a/an\" in that, for example, \"an apple\" never means more than one apple but \"give me \"some\" apples\" indicates more than one is desired but without specifying a quantity. In this view it is functionally homologous to the Spanish plural indefinite article \"unos/unas\"; \"un/una\" (\"one\") is completely indistinguishable from the unit number, except where it has a plural form (\"unos/unas\"). Thus \"Dame una manzana\" (\"Give me an apple\")\" but \"Dame \"unas\" manzanas\" (\"Give me \"some\" apples\"). The indefiniteness of \"some\" or \"unos\" can sometimes be semiquantitatively narrowed, as in \"There are \"some\" apples there, but not many.\"\n\n\"Some\" also serves as a singular indefinite article, as in \"There is \"some\" person on the porch\".\n\nA proper article indicates that its noun is proper, and refers to a unique entity. It may be the name of a person, the name of a place, the name of a planet, etc. The Maori language has the proper article \"a\", which is used for personal nouns; so, \"a Pita\" means \"Peter\". In Maori, when the personal nouns have the definite or indefinite article as an important part of it, both articles are present; for example, the phrase \"a Te Rauparaha\", which contains both the proper article \"a\" and the definite article \"Te\" refers to the person name Te Rauparaha.\n\nThe definite article is sometimes also used with proper names, which are already specified by definition (there \"is\" just one of them). For example: \"the Amazon, the Hebrides\". In these cases, the definite article may be considered superfluous. Its presence can be accounted for by the assumption that they are shorthand for a longer phrase in which the name is a specifier, i.e. \"the Amazon River\", \"the Hebridean Islands\". Where the nouns in such longer phrases cannot be omitted, the definite article is universally kept: \"the United States\", \"the People's Republic of China\". This distinction can sometimes become a political matter: the former usage \"the Ukraine\" stressed the word's Russian meaning of \"borderlands\"; as Ukraine became a fully independent state following the collapse of the Soviet Union, it requested that formal mentions of its name omit the article. Similar shifts in usage have occurred in the names of Sudan and both Congo (Brazzaville) and Congo (Kinshasa); a move in the other direction occurred with The Gambia. In certain languages, such as French and Italian, definite articles are used with all or most names of countries: \"la France/le Canada/l'Allemagne, l'Italia/la Spagna/il Brasile\".\n\nSome languages also use definite articles with personal names. For example, such use is standard in Portuguese (\"a Maria\", literally: \"the Maria\"), in Greek (η Μαρία, ο Γιώργος, ο Δούναβης, η Παρασκευή) and in Catalan (la Núria, el/en Oriol). It also occurs colloquially in Spanish, German, French, Italian and other languages. In Hungary it is considered to be a Germanism.\n\nRarely, this usage can appear in English. A prominent example is how President of The United States and businessman Donald Trump is known as \"The Donald\", this wording being used by many publications such as \"Newsweek\" and \"New York Post\". (This is derived from his ex-wife Ivana Trump's use of the article with his name, a second-language error influenced by the lack of articles in her native Slovene.) Another is US President Ronald Reagan's nickname of \"The Gipper\"; publisher Townhall.com issued an article after Reagan's death titled simply \"Goodbye to 'the Gipper'\".\n\nA partitive article is a type of article, sometimes viewed as a type of indefinite article, used with a mass noun such as \"water\", to indicate a non-specific quantity of it. Partitive articles are a class of determiner; they are used in French and Italian in addition to definite and indefinite articles. (In Finnish and Estonian, the partitive is indicated by inflection.) The nearest equivalent in English is \"some\", although the latter is classified as a determiner but not in all authorities' classifications as an indefinite article, and English uses it less than French uses \"de\". \n\nHaida has a partitive article (suffixed \"-gyaa\") referring to \"part of something or... to one or more objects of a given group or category,\" e.g., \"tluugyaa uu hal tlaahlaang\" \"he is making a boat (a member of the category of boats).\"\n\nA negative article specifies \"none\" of its noun, and can thus be regarded as neither definite nor indefinite. On the other hand, some consider such a word to be a simple determiner rather than an article. In English, this function is fulfilled by \"no\", which can appear before a singular or plural noun: \n\nThe zero article is the absence of an article. In languages having a definite article, the lack of an article specifically indicates that the noun is indefinite. Linguists interested in X-bar theory causally link zero articles to nouns lacking a determiner. In English, the zero article rather than the indefinite is used with plurals and mass nouns, although the word \"some\" can be used as an indefinite plural article.\n\nArticles are found in many Indo-European languages, Semitic languages (only the definite article), and Polynesian languages, but are formally absent from many of the world’s major languages, such as Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese, Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu, the majority of Slavic and Baltic languages (incl. Russian), Yoruba, and the Bantu languages. In some languages that do have articles, like for example some North Caucasian languages, the use of articles is optional but in others like English and German it is mandatory in all cases.\n\nLinguists believe the common ancestor of the Indo-European languages, Proto-Indo-European, did not have articles. Most of the languages in this family do not have definite or indefinite articles: there is no article in Latin or Sanskrit, nor in some modern Indo-European languages, such as the families of Slavic languages (except for Bulgarian and Macedonian, which are rather distinctive among the Slavic languages in their grammar) and Baltic languages. Although Classical Greek had a definite article (which has survived into Modern Greek and which bears strong functional resemblance to the German definite article, which it is related to), the earlier Homeric Greek used this article largely as a pronoun or demonstrative, whereas the earliest known form of Greek known as Mycenaean Greek did not have any articles. Articles developed independently in several language families.\n\nNot all languages have both definite and indefinite articles, and some languages have different types of definite and indefinite articles to distinguish finer shades of meaning: for example, French and Italian have a partitive article used for indefinite mass nouns, whereas Colognian has two distinct sets of definite articles indicating focus and uniqueness, and Macedonian uses definite articles in a demonstrative sense, with a tripartite distinction (proximal, medial, distal) based on distance from the speaker or interlocutor. The words \"this\" and \"that\" (and their plurals, \"these\" and \"those\") can be understood in English as, ultimately, forms of the definite article \"the\" (whose declension in Old English included \"thaes\", an ancestral form of this/that and these/those).\n\nIn many languages, the form of the article may vary according to the gender, number, or case of its noun. In some languages the article may be the only indication of the case. Many languages do not use articles at all, and may use other ways of indicating old versus new information, such as topic–comment constructions.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Grammatically speaking Finnish has no articles, but the words \"se\" (it) and \"yks(i)\" (one) are used in the same fashion as \"the\" and \"a/an\" in English and are, for all intents and purposes, treated like articles when used in this manner in colloquial Finnish. \n\nThe following examples show articles which are always suffixed to the noun:\n\n\nExamples of prefixed definite articles: \n\nA different way, limited to the definite article, is used by Latvian and Lithuanian. \nThe noun does not change but the adjective can be defined or undefined. In Latvian: \"galds\", a table / the table; \"balts galds\", a white table; \"baltais galds\", the white table. In Lithuanian: \"stalas\", a table / the table; \"baltas stalas\", a white table; \"baltasis stalas\", the white table.\n\nLanguages in the above table written in \"italics\" are constructed languages and are not natural, that is to say that they have been purposefully invented by an individual (or group of individuals) with some purpose in mind. They do, however, all belong to language families themselves. Esperanto is derived from European languages and therefore all of its roots are found in Proto-Indo-European and cognates can be found in real-world languages like French, German, Italian and English. Interlingua is also based on European languages but with its main source being that of Italic descendent languages: English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, with German and Russian being secondary sources, with words from further afield (but internationally known and often borrowed) contributing to the language's vocabulary (such as words taken from Japanese, Arabic and Finnish). The result is a supposedly easy-to-learn language for the world. As well as these \"auxiliary\" languages the list contains two more: Quenya and Sindarin; these two languages were created by Professor Tolkien and used in his fictional works. They are not based on any real-world language family (as are Esperanto and Interlingua), but do share a common history with roots in Common Eldarin. \n\nWhen using a definite article in Tokelauan language, unlike in some languages like English, if the speaker is speaking of an item, they need not to have referred to it previously as long as the item is specific. This is also true when it comes to the reference of a specific person. So, although the definite article used to describe a noun in the Tokelauan language is \"te\", it can also translate to the indefinite article in languages that requires the item being spoken of to have been referenced prior. When translating to English, \"te\" could translate to the English definite article \"the\", or it could also translate to the English indefinite article \"a\". An example of how the definite article \"te\" can be used as an interchangeable definite or indefinite article in the Tokelauan language would be the sentence “\"Kua hau te tino\"”. In the English language, this could be translated as “A man has arrived” or “The man has arrived” where using \"te\" as the article in this sentence can represent any man or a particular man. The word \"he\", which is the indefinite article in Tokelauan, is used to describe ‘any such item’. The word \"he\" is used in negative statements because that is where it is most often found, alongside its great use in interrogative statements. Though this is something to make note of, \"he\" is not used in just in negative statements and questions alone. Although these two types of statements are where \"he\" occurs the most, it is also used in other statements as well. An example of the use of \"he\" as an indefinite article is “\"Vili ake oi k'aumai he toki\" ”, where ‘\"he toki\" ’ mean ‘an axe’. The use of \"he\" and \"te\" in Tokelauan are reserved for when describing a singular noun. However, when describing a plural noun, different articles are used. For plural definite nouns, rather than \"te\", the article \"nā\" is used. ‘\"Vili ake oi k'aumai nā nofoa\"’ in Tokelauan would translate to “Do run and bring me the chairs” in English. There are some special cases in which instead of using \"nā\", plural definite nouns have no article before them. The absence of an article is represented by \"0\". One way that it is usually used is if a large amount or a specific class of things are being described. Occasionally, such as if one was describing an entire class of things in a nonspecific fashion, the singular definite noun \"te\" would is used. In English, ‘\"Ko te povi e kai mutia\"’ means “Cows eat grass”. Because this is a general statement about cows, \"te\" is used instead of \"nā\". The \"ko\" serves as a preposition to the “\"te\"” The article \"ni\" is used for describing a plural indefinite noun. ‘\"E i ei ni tuhi?\"’ translates to “Are there any books?”\n\nArticles have developed independently in many different language families across the globe. Generally, articles develop over time usually by specialization of certain adjectives or determiners, and their development is often a sign of languages becoming more analytic instead of synthetic, perhaps combined with the loss of inflection as in English, Romance languages, Bulgarian, Macedonian and Torlakian.\n\nJoseph Greenberg in\nUniversals of Human Language\ndescribes \"the cycle of the definite article\": Definite articles (Stage I) evolve from demonstratives, and in turn can become generic articles (Stage II) that may be used in both definite and indefinite contexts, and later merely noun markers (Stage III) that are part of nouns other than proper names and more recent borrowings. Eventually articles may evolve anew from demonstratives.\n\nDefinite articles typically arise from demonstratives meaning \"that\". For example, the definite articles in most Romance languages—e.g., \"el\", \"il\", \"le\", \"la\", \"lo\" — derive from the Latin demonstratives \"ille\" (masculine), \"illa\" (feminine) and \"illud\" (neuter).\n\nThe English definite article \"the\", written \"þe\" in Middle English, derives from an Old English demonstrative, which, according to gender, was written \"se\" (masculine), \"seo\" (feminine) (\"þe\" and \"þeo\" in the Northumbrian dialect), or \"þæt\" (neuter). The neuter form \"þæt\" also gave rise to the modern demonstrative \"that\". The \"ye\" occasionally seen in pseudo-archaic usage such as \"Ye Olde Englishe Tea Shoppe\" is actually a form of \"þe\", where the letter thorn (\"þ\") came to be written as a \"y\".\n\nMultiple demonstratives can give rise to multiple definite articles. Macedonian, for example, in which the articles are suffixed, has \"столот\" (\"stolot\"), the chair; \"столов\" (\"stolov\"), this chair; and \"столон\" (\"stolon\"), that chair. These derive from the Common Slavic demonstratives \"*tъ\" \"this, that\", \"*ovъ\" \"this here\" and \"*onъ\" \"that over there, yonder\" respectively. Colognian prepositions articles such as in \"dat Auto\", or \"et Auto\", the car; the first being specifically selected, focused, newly introduced, while the latter is not selected, unfocused, already known, general, or generic. Standard Basque distinguishes between proximal and distal definite articles in the plural (dialectally, a proximal singular and an additional medial grade may also be present). The Basque distal form (with infix \"-a-\", etymologically a suffixed and phonetically reduced form of the distal demonstrative \"har-/hai-\") functions as the default definite article, whereas the proximal form (with infix \"-o-\", derived from the proximal demonstrative \"hau-/hon-\") is marked and indicates some kind of (spatial or otherwise) close relationship between the speaker and the referent (e.g., it may imply that the speaker is included in the referent): \"etxeak\" (\"the houses\") vs. \"etxeok\" (\"these houses [of ours]\"), \"euskaldunak\" (\"the Basque speakers\") vs. \"euskaldunok\" (\"we, the Basque speakers\").\n\nIndefinite articles typically arise from adjectives meaning \"one\". For example, the indefinite articles in the Romance languages—e.g., \"un\", \"una\", \"une\"—derive from the Latin adjective \"unus\". Partitive articles, however, derive from Vulgar Latin \"de illo\", meaning \"(some) of the\".\n\nThe English indefinite article \"an\" is derived from the same root as \"one\". The \"-n\" came to be dropped before consonants, giving rise to the shortened form \"a\". The existence of both forms has led to many cases of juncture loss, for example transforming the original \"a napron\" into the modern \"an apron\".\n\nThe Persian indefinite article is \"yek\", meaning one.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15144359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15144359", "title": "Black Hispanic and Latino Americans", "text": "Black Hispanic and Latino Americans\n\nIn the United States, a Black Hispanic or Afro-Hispanic (), is an American citizen or resident who is officially classified by the United States Census Bureau, Office of Management and Budget and other U.S. government agencies as a black person or racially black of Hispanic descent.\"\n\nHispanicity, which is independent of race, is the only \"ethnic\" category, as opposed to racial category, which is officially collated by the U.S. Census Bureau. The distinction made by government agencies for those within the population of any official race category, including \"Black\", is between those who report Hispanic backgrounds and all others who do not. \"Non-Hispanic Blacks\" consists of an ethnically diverse collection of all others who are classified as Black or African American that do not report Hispanic ethnic backgrounds.\n\nStates like New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Connecticut have some of the highest percentages of Hispanics identifying as Black, where up to 25% of Hispanics identify as black, compared to 2.5% of Hispanics nationwide. Overall, the Northeast region has the largest concentration of Black Hispanics, this is partly because of the large Puerto Rican, Dominican, and other mostly or partly African descended Hispanic populations in the region.\n\nBlack Hispanics account for 2.5% of the entire U.S. Hispanic population. Most Black Hispanics in the United States come from within the Dominican and Puerto Rican populations. Aside from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, large numbers of Black Hispanics can also be found in populations originating from Cuba, northern South America, and the Caribbean coast of Central America as well, including the Cuban, Panamanian, and Colombian communities, among others.\n\nThe main aspects which distinguish Black Hispanics born in the United States of America from African Americans is having Spanish as their mother tongue or most recent ancestors' native language, their culture passed down by their parents, and their Spanish surnames. Of all Hispanic groups, Puerto Ricans have the closest relationship with the African American community, and because of this there is also increasing intermarriages and offspring between non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics of any race, mainly between Puerto Ricans and African Americans, which increases both the Hispanic ethnic and black racial demographics.\n\nSince the early days of the movie industry in the United States of America, when Black Hispanic actors were given roles, they would usually be cast as African Americans. For those with Spanish-speaking accents that betrayed an otherwise presumed African American, they may seldom have been given roles as Hispanics, and the mixed race Hispanic and Latino actors of African appearance were mostly given Hispanic roles.\n\nThose who claim that Black Hispanics are not sought to play Hispanic roles in the United States allege this unfairly leads the masses of viewers to an ignorance to the existence of darker skinned Hispanics. Further, some Black Hispanics who identify themselves as black but of also mixed race heritage once affirming their Hispanicity may be deprived of their status as Black people among African Americans, and categorized by society as non-Black in the American historical context.\n\nSame situation happens in U.S. Hispanic media; critics accuse U.S. Hispanic media, including Latin American media, of overlooking black Hispanic and Latino Americans and black Latin Americans in the \"telenovelas\", mostly stereotyping them as impoverished people.\n\nA review of twenty-one studies found Black Hispanics to have poorer health compared to White Hispanics. The causes are still unknown, but researchers suggested that racial discrimination and segregation may contribute to racial health differences among the Hispanic population in the United States.\n\nAlthough Black Hispanics are often overlooked or dichotomized as either \"black\" or \"hispanic\" in the United States of America, Black Hispanic writers often reflect upon their racialized experience in their works. The most commonly used term in literature to speak of this ambiguity and multilayered hybridity at the heart of Latino/a identity and culture is \"miscegenation\". This \"mestizaje\" depicts the multi-faceted racial and cultural identity that characterize Black Hispanics and highlights that each individual Black Hispanic has a unique experience within a broader racial and ethnic range. The memoirs, poetry, sociological research, and essays written by the following Afro-Latino writers reflect this concept of mestizaje in addition to revealing the confusion and uncertainty about one's self-image of being both \"Black\" and \"Hispanic\". The psychological and social factors also prove to be central in determining how one ultimately defines him/herself.\n\n\n\n"}

It was founded by Omar Ronda, Alex Angi, Renzo Nucara, Carlo Rizzetti, Marco Veronese and Vittorio Valente who left the group almost immediately replaced by Kicco. In 2001 Alessandro Pianca has been part of the group for one year. In 2003 William Sweetlove joined the movement. In 2008, Omar Ronda, the founder, abandoned the project in order to follow his personal career.\n\nCracking Art movement is currently formed by five artists: Alex Angi, Renzo Nucara, Marco Veronese, William Sweetlove and Kicco. The common aim is to change the history of art through a strong social and environmental commitment that, combined with an innovative use of plastic materials, evokes the close relationship between natural and artificial reality.\n\nThe name \"Cracking Art\" comes from the verb \"to crack\" which indicates the state of being split, broken, crashed. Moreover, the catalytic cracking is the name that stands for the chemical reaction occurring when the raw crude oil is converted into plastic. This is the reason why for the movement \"cracking\" represents the moment when something natural becomes artificial, the most important instant that for the artists of the movement should be represented through art.\n\n\nThe concept of Regeneration enlivens the artistic history of the movement since its origins. The plastic, chosen material of the movement, has the eternal property of being crushed and reshaped into other sculptures. The artworks are designed to inspire sensibility in recycling plastic for the environment while leaving a significant artistic value to the world we live in. Recycling plastic means to subtract toxic destruction which devastates nature, as well as creating plastic artworks means to communicate through an universal language while paying strong attention to the planet.\n\nThe aim is to connect common reasoning to individual meditation, creating installations with animals that appear unexpectedly in everyday places. The astonishment of meeting an ordinary subject transformed into something extraordinary through its super size, color and shape catches people attention and invites them to see urban life and cities in a different way.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "881233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=881233", "title": "Demarcation problem", "text": "Demarcation problem\n\nThe demarcation problem in the philosophy of science is about how to distinguish between science and non-science, including between science, pseudoscience, and other products of human activity, like art and literature, and beliefs. The debate continues after over two millennia of dialogue among philosophers of science and scientists in various fields, and despite broad agreement on the basics of scientific method.\n\nAn early attempt at demarcation can be seen in the efforts of Greek natural philosophers and medical practitioners to distinguish their methods and their accounts of nature from the mythological or mystical accounts of their predecessors and contemporaries.\nIn Charmides Plato discusses a \"science of science\". Although the subject in the dialogue is epistemological, it is an early version of the demarcation problem.\n\nG. E. R. Lloyd notes that there was a sense in which the groups engaged in various forms of inquiry into nature set out to \"legitimate their own positions,\" laying \"claim to a new kind of wisdom ... that purported to yield superior enlightenment, even superior practical effectiveness.\" Medical writers in the Hippocratic tradition maintained that their discussions were based on necessary demonstrations, a theme developed by Aristotle in his Posterior Analytics. One element of this polemic for science was an insistence on a clear and unequivocal presentation of arguments, rejecting the imagery, analogy, and myth of the old wisdom. Some of their claimed naturalistic explanations of phenomena have been found to be quite fanciful, with little reliance on actual observations.\n\nLogical positivism, formulated in the 1920s, held that only statements about matters of fact or logical relations between concepts are meaningful. All other statements lack sense and are labelled \"metaphysics\" (see the verifiability theory of meaning also known as verificationism). This distinction between science, which in the view of the Vienna Circle possessed empirically verifiable statements, and what they pejoratively called \"metaphysics\", which lacked such statements, can be seen as representing another aspect of the demarcation problem. Logical positivism is often discussed in the context of the demarcation between science and non-science or pseudoscience. However, \"The verificationist proposals had the aim of solving a distinctly different demarcation problem, namely that between science and metaphysics.\"\n\nFalsifiability is the demarcation criterion proposed by Karl Popper as opposed to verificationism: \"statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable observations\". Popper saw demarcation as a central problem in the philosophy of science. Unlike the Vienna Circle, Popper stated that his proposal was not a criterion of \"meaningfulness\".\n\nIn Popper's later work, he stated that falsifiability is both a necessary and a sufficient criterion for demarcation. He described falsifiability as a property of \"the logical structure of sentences and classes of sentences,\" so that a statement's scientific or non-scientific status does not change over time. This has been summarized as a statement being falsifiable \"if and only if it logically contradicts some (empirical) sentence that describes a logically possible event that it would be logically possible to observe.\"\n\nNicholas Maxwell has argued that physics only accepts theories that are sufficiently unified, this persistent preference for unity committing physics to accepting an implicit metaphysical (i.e. non-falsifiable) thesis concerning the unity of nature. For good Popperian reasons, this implicit metaphysical thesis needs to be made explicit within physics so that it can be critically assessed and, we may hope, improved. Popper's demarcation criterion is refuted: an unfalsifiable, metaphysical thesis is a basic tenet of scientific knowledge within physics, whether this is recognized or not.\n\nThomas Kuhn, an American historian and philosopher of science, is often connected with what has been called postpositivism or postempiricism. In his 1962 book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", Kuhn divided the process of doing science into two different endeavors, which he called normal science and extraordinary science (which he sometimes also called \"revolutionary science\"). \"In Kuhn's view, 'it is normal science, in which Sir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from other enterprises'…\" That is, the utility of a scientific paradigm for puzzle-solving lies in its suggesting solutions to new problems while continuing to satisfy all of the problems solved by the paradigm that it replaces.\n\nPopper criticized Kuhn's demarcation criterion, saying that astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and that therefore Kuhn's criterion recognized astrology as a science. He stated that Kuhn's criterion leads to a \"major disaster…[the] replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological one\".\n\nKuhn's work largely called into question Popper's demarcation, and emphasized the human, subjective quality of scientific change. Paul Feyerabend was concerned that the very question of demarcation was insidious: science itself had no need of a demarcation criterion, but instead some philosophers were seeking to justify a special position of authority from which science could dominate public discourse. Feyerabend argued that science does not in fact occupy a special place in terms of either its logic or method, and no claim to special authority made by scientists can be upheld. He argued that, within the history of scientific practice, no rule or method can be found that has not been violated or circumvented at some point in order to advance scientific knowledge. Both Imre Lakatos and Feyerabend suggest that science is not an autonomous form of reasoning, but is inseparable from the larger body of human thought and inquiry.\n\nPaul R. Thagard has proposed another set of principles to try to overcome these difficulties, and believes it is important for society to find a way of doing so. According to Thagard's method, a theory is not scientific if it satisfies two conditions:\n\nThagard specifies that sometimes theories will spend some time as merely \"unpromising\" before they truly deserve the title of pseudoscience. He cites astrology as an example: it was stagnant compared to advances in physics during the 17th century, and only later became \"pseudoscience\" in the advent of alternative explanations provided by psychology during the 19th century.\n\nThagard also states that his criteria should not be interpreted so narrowly as to allow willful ignorance of alternative explanations, or so broadly as to discount our modern science compared to science of the future. His definition is a practical one, which generally seeks to distinguish pseudoscience as areas of inquiry which are stagnant and without active scientific investigation.\n\nMany historians of science are concerned with the development of science from its primitive origins; consequently they define science in sufficiently broad terms to include early forms of natural knowledge. In the article on science in the eleventh edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", the scientist and historian William Cecil Dampier Whetham defined science as \"ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them.\" In his study of Greek science, Marshall Clagett defined science as \"first, the orderly and systematic comprehension, description and/or explanation of natural phenomena and, secondly, the [mathematical and logical] tools necessary for the undertaking.\" A similar definition appeared more recently in David Pingree's study of early science: \"Science is a systematic explanation of perceived or imaginary phenomena, or else is based on such an explanation. Mathematics finds a place in science only as one of the symbolical languages in which scientific explanations may be expressed.\" These definitions tend to focus more on the subject matter of science than on its method and from these perspectives, the philosophical concern to establish a line of demarcation between science and non-science becomes \"problematic, if not futile.\"\n\nLarry Laudan concluded, after examining various historical attempts to establish a demarcation criterion, that \"philosophy has failed to deliver the goods\" in its attempts to distinguish science from non-science—to distinguish science from pseudoscience. None of the past attempts would be accepted by a majority of philosophers nor, in his view, should they be accepted by them or by anyone else. He stated that many well-founded beliefs are not scientific and, conversely, many scientific conjectures are not well-founded. He also stated that demarcation criteria were historically used as in polemical disputes between \"scientists\" and \"pseudo-scientists.\" Advancing a number of examples from everyday practice of football and carpentry and non-scientific scholarship such as literary criticism and philosophy, he saw the question of whether a belief is well-founded or not to be more practically and philosophically significant than whether it is scientific or not. In his judgment, the demarcation between science and non-science was a pseudo-problem that would best be replaced by focusing on the distinction between reliable and unreliable knowledge, without bothering to ask whether that knowledge is scientific or not. He would consign phrases like \"pseudo-science\" or \"unscientific\" to the rhetoric of politicians or sociologists.\n\nOthers have disagreed with Laudan. Sebastian Lutz, for example, argues that demarcation does not have to be a single necessary and sufficient condition as Laudan implied. Rather, Laudan's reasoning at the most establishes that there has to be one necessary criterion and one possibly different sufficient criterion. Other critics have argued for multiple demarcation criteria suggesting that there should be one set of criteria for the natural sciences; another set of criteria for the social sciences, and claims involving the supernatural could have a set of pseudoscientific criteria. Massimo Pigliucci wrote that science generally conforms to Ludwig Wittgenstein's concept of family resemblances.\n\nConcerning science education, Michael D. Gordin wrote:\nDiscussions of the demarcation problem highlight the rhetoric of science and promote critical thinking. Citizens thinking critically, and expressing themselves with reasoned argument in policy discussion, contribute to enlightened democracy. For example, Gordin stated\nThe demarcation problem has been compared to the problem of differentiating fake news from real news, which rose to prominence in the 2016 United States presidential election.\n\n"}

{"id": "3491725", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3491725", "title": "Gaspar Saladino", "text": "Gaspar Saladino\n\nGaspar Saladino (September 1, 1927 – August 4, 2016) was an American letterer and logo designer who worked for more than sixty years in the comic book industry, mostly for DC Comics. Eventually Saladino went by one name, \"Gaspar,\" which he wrote in his trademark calligraphy.\n\nFrom 1966 to the 1990s he lettered many of the logos, titles, captions and balloons on DC Comics covers. For a period in the 1970s, he was also \"page-one letterer\" for many Marvel Comics books.\n\nSaladino was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and attended Manhattan's School of Industrial Art. While in school Saladino did some comic-book inking for Lloyd Jacquet's \"Funnies, Inc.\", one of several \"packagers\" of the time that produced outsourced comics for publishers entering the new medium. After graduating from high school, Saladino enlisted in the U.S. Army, which stationed him in Japan in a public relations capacity. He returned home in 1947.\n\nIn 1949, he approached DC Comics, where production chief Sol Harrison showed Saladino's art samples to editors. One, Julius Schwartz, while unimpressed with the art, offered Saladino regular work as a letterer. Though working in the office, ensconced between letterer Ira Schnapp and production artist Mort Drucker, Saladino was employed as a freelancer, earning $2 a page and generally earning $90 a week. He recalled in a 2007 interview, \"DC wanted a full-time letterer and by being present I got first choice of assignments. I also thought it was beneficial to be able to work hand in hand with the artists.\"\n\nSaladino recalled in 2007 that his first job for DC was a \"cowboy romance\" comic. The title was \"Romance Trail\" #5 (March–April 1950) in which he lettered two stories, \"Romance By Mail\" with art by Carmine Infantino and Joe Giella, and a one-page poem \"Western Serenade\" with art by Alex Toth. These were Saladino's first printed works for DC. They were followed by more work in \"Romance Trail\" and the western series \"Jimmy Wakely\", starting with issue #5 (June 1950).\n\nHe did much of the lettering for the humor strips of Henry Boltinoff in \"Action Comics\". In the late 1950s and 1960s, Saladino was a mainstay on DC editor Julius Schwartz's books, like \"Strange Adventures\", \"Mystery in Space\", \"Justice League of America\", \"The Flash\", \"Showcase\", and many more.\n\nWhen Carmine Infantino came on as DC's art director and then editorial director in 1966/1967, he gradually shifted all of DC's premiere lettering tasks: logos, cover lettering and house ads, from veteran letterer Ira Schnapp to Saladino. This changed the whole line's look, adding Saladino's bold, dynamic style., Saladino continued to letter many interior pages as well.\n\nIn the late 1960s, while freelancing for DC, Saladino began freelancing for Marvel as well, using the pseudonym L.P. Gregory and lettering titles including \"Iron Man\", \"The Avengers\" and \"Tales to Astonish\". In the mid-to-late 1970s Saladino became the uncredited \"page-one letterer\" for many Marvel Comics titles. He eventually credited himself as simply either Gaspar or Gaspar S.\n\nIn 1976, Saladino lettered the historic DC-Marvel crossover comic \"Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man\". He also lettered the oversize special issue \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\". By 1977, Saladino was lettering most of DC's war comics, in addition to many superhero and mystery stories. From 1976 to 1977, he lettered the Los Angeles Times Syndicate comic strip \"The Virtue of Vera Valiant\", by writer Stan Lee and artist Frank Springer.\n\nSaladino's output after 2002 was minimal.\n\nSaladino designed the logos for DC's \"Swamp Thing\", \"Vigilante\", \"Phantom Stranger\", \"Metal Men\", \"Adam Strange\", \"House of Mystery\", \"House of Secrets\", and \"Unknown Soldier\", among others. He also re-designed established character logos to make them more contemporary and stylish, such as with \"Green Lantern\". He also did the lettering for cover blurbs for a wide variety of titles and for seasonal house ads that ran in several issues at a time.\n\nFor Marvel, Saladino's logos, which he either created or updated, include \"The Avengers\", \"Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos\", \"Captain America and the Falcon\", and \"Marvel Triple Action\".\n\nIn 1974, with the launch of the short-lived publisher Atlas Comics, Saladino designed logos for all the company's titles.\n\nIn the 1980s he designed logos for Neal Adams' Continuity Comics and for some titles published by Eclipse Comics.\n\nIn the 1990s he designed product logos for the Lucky Mojo Curio Company, a metaphysical supply manufactory founded by Catherine Yronwode, the former editor-in-chief of Eclipse Comics.\n\nSaladino's default dialoguing style was curvy and naturally enmeshed with the artwork. When producing house ads or cover blurbs, he sometimes altered the standard letterforms in order to interlock letters. One trademark was his use of big, bold, oversized exclamation points.\n\nDuring the early 1970s Saladino lettered the interiors for the then-new title \"Swamp Thing\". It was in the pages of this series that he created the concept of character-designated fonts, with Swamp Thing's distinctive outlined, \"drippy\" letters.\n\nSaladino always lettered by hand. Likewise, his word balloons were drawn freehand, never with a template.\n\nSaladino and his wife Celeste were married in 1957. At first the couple lived in Queens Village, then moved to a home in Plainview, Long Island in 1959, where they lived the rest of Gaspar's life. They had three children, Greg (born in 1960), Lisa (1962) and Peter (1965). At present there are five grandchildren: Jordan, Brea, Jackson, Alyssa and Kaila. In April 2013, he was named honorary chief of the Plainview Fire Department as a 50-year member. \n\n\n"}
{"id": "728770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=728770", "title": "Hans-Peter Martin", "text": "Hans-Peter Martin\n\nHans-Peter Martin (born 11 August 1957) is an Austrian author and journalist and former politician who has been a Member of the European Parliament between 1999 and 2014.\n\nBorn in Bregenz, Vorarlberg, Martin worked for the German weekly news magazine \"Der Spiegel\". As a freelance writer, he has written and co-authored several popular books, among them the best-selling \"The Global Trap: Globalization and the Assault on Prosperity and Democracy\" (\"Die Globalisierungsfalle\", 1996), \"Bitter Pills\" (\"Bittere Pillen\") about the pros and cons of pharmaceuticals and \"The European Trap\" (\"Die Europafalle\", only available in German but a partial translation is available on Martin's website), an inside analysis of European integration, faults of the European bureaucracy and lobbyism in the EU.\n\nThe publishing house Penguin Random House released a new book by Hans-Peter Martin carrying the title \"Game Over: Wellbeing for the few, Democracy for no one, Nationalism for all - and then?\" in September 2018.\"Game over\" was shortlisted, together with nine other books, for the best German Economic Book of the year 2018.\n\nIn the 1999 European Parliament elections Martin was selected as leader of the Social Democratic Party of Austria's group. However, differences with the party's leadership led to his complete break with the SPÖ.\n\nSince then Martin has been reelected twice through his independent candidate list, Hans-Peter Martin's List.\n\nEarly in 2004, he accused MEPs of all parties of falsely claiming reimbursement of travel and subsistence expenses. He produced evidence of MEP's signing the register in the morning to receive their daily allowance, and then immediately leaving the building. Broadcast on German TV, the accusations caused an uproar. The then European Parliament spokesman Hans Gert Pöttering dismissed Martin's accusations as unnecessarily aggressive and the President of the Parliament Pat Cox said that he would have preferred to deal with the case internally.\n\nIn response, Martin was accused of claiming too much in meal expenses. He was later cleared of this charge.\n\nEventually the disclosures and the public outrage Martin's revelations induced resulted in a change of the expense system.\n\nIn the 2004 European Parliament elections Hans-Peter Martin decided to compete on his own party list \"Hans-Peter Martin's List – For genuine control and transparency in Brussels\" (\"Liste Dr. Hans-Peter Martin – Für echte Kontrolle in Brüssel\"). For an independent he received a surprising 14% of the vote – more than the Greens or the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party – and gained two of Austria's seats in the European Parliament. He has been widely credited with having reduced the vote share of the far-right parties.\n\nThe second mandate went to Austrian Karin Resetarits, a former journalist with the Austrian public broadcaster ORF and a private radio station. However, Martin and Resetarits soon found themselves in heavy disagreement and ceased to work together. She later joined the Liberal group in the European Parliament on June 7, 2005 and was not reelected.\n\nMartin's list also competed in the Austrian legislative elections of 2006, but received only 2.8% of the vote and thus was blocked from entry into the Austrian parliament by the requirement to at least have 4% of the vote. Martin explained the unexpectedly low result with accusations of \"expedient but contrary to the rule\" use of the secretarial allowance, which were widely publicised in the Austrian media. The later court ruling stated that Martin used the funds correctly and did not benefit from the money, but as he did not follow some formal requirements he was ordered to repay the funds. Martin argued that this was a political decision.\n\nIn 2009, Martin flirted with the idea of heading a planned Austrian list of the pan-European eurosceptical alliance Libertas.eu, but later rebuffed Libertas' advances.\n\nWhile Libertas finally didn't manage to set up a list at all, Martin successfully competed again with his independent Hans-Peter Martin's List. He even surprised many by increasing his vote share to 18%, giving his list three seats in the European Parliament.\n\nDuring his mandate Martin vocally campaigned for transparency and against lobbying. Since 2011 he collects and publishes all lobby invitations his office receives and in 2013 published an analysis.

The term \"healthism\" was most likely first used by the political economist Robert Crawford, whose article \"Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life\" was published in 1980. In this article Crawford describes how the new political ideology, which emerged in the US during the 1970s, \"[situated] the problem of health and disease at the level of the individual.\" The term is also known for its use in the 1994 book \"The Death of Humane Medicine and the Rise of Coercive Healthism\" by Petr Skrabanek. Skrabanek's use of \"healthism\", and most subsequent uses, are pejorative in intent. However, there is also a growing movement in the 21st century which see healthism as a positive empowering phenomenon which is not inherently coercive. This is exemplified through its popular uptake in the form of preventive medicine, yoga, meditation, fitness regimes, diets and the emphasis on lifestyle changes in Western society.\n\n"}

{"id": "12934827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12934827", "title": "Information manipulation theory", "text": "Information manipulation theory\n\nInformation manipulation theory (IMT) (McCornack 1992) & (McCornack et al. 1992) is a way of looking at interpersonal communication. It deals with the way a sender might assemble information packages (in the form of messages) to a receiver in order to give an impression that is false from the perspective of the sender. The sender chooses certain facts in the message from an available amount of information—but omits, alters, or falsifies others. The act of trying to get someone to believe something untrue is \"deceit\". The type of communication created by such deceitful intent is called a deceptive message. The senders management of given information to provide a receiver with a false perception of that same information is called \"information manipulation\". Departing from the focus on the communication mode found in Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT), IMT is more concerned with the content of the deceptive messages, the situational contexts that bring them about, the degree to which the detection of such a message affects perception of deception and the relational consequences associated with deceptive messages.\n\nInformation manipulation theory (IMT) was formulated by Steven A. McCornack while an assistant professor and a Lilly Endowment Teaching Fellow at Michigan State University. In 1992, McCornack published two articles that are recognized as the seminal works in information manipulation theory. In his first article, McCornack lays out the basic foundation of this theoretical option for examining the phenomenon of creating and relaying deceptive messages. As stated, IMT “suggests that deceptive messages function deceptively because they violate the principles that govern conversational exchanges” (McCornack 1992). The second article (McCornack et al. 1992) provided an empirical test of the theory.\n\nTimothy Levine (PhD, Michigan State University, 1992) was present for the first empirical test for information manipulation theory, has been a significant contributor to the development of IMT, and is a leader in developing new paradigms for deception detection research. IMT provided impetus to the development of a message-based theory of deception detection that calls into question psychophysical and emotion-based theories of deception detection as well as the interaction-based IDT.\n\nInformation manipulation theory, not unlike Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT) is a subset and functional manifestation of interpersonal communication. According to David Buller and Judee Burgoon, “Deception is conceptualized as a form of information management, something that is fundamental to human communication (Buller & Burgoon 1998).” IMT is concerned with the way that relational goals and situational pressures influence the interpersonal communication process, and ultimately leads to the formation and implementation of deceptive verbal messages.\n\nPrior to the introduction of information manipulation theory as a potential way to observe the phenomenon of verbally controlling information there was literature on the subject of information control and deception in general. McCornack cites Turner, Edgley and Olmstead (1975) and how they “noted several forms of information control in their study of conversations (e.g. “lies,” “exaggerations,” “half-truths,” “secrets,” and diversionary responses) (McCornack et al. 1992).” Buller and Burgoon again draw upon Turner et al. when referring to deception as “a very common form of information management in human interaction (Buller and Burgoon 1998).” With the notion of deception already being established in circles of communication studies and behavioral science as a topic of discussion and analysis by the 1980s, we have the development of conceptual constructs regarding the topic. In 1984, Hopper and Bell introduce a typology of deceptive types using English terms. The types noted in McCornack’s work are listed as follows: unlies, playings, fiction, masks, lies, and crimes (McCornack et al. 1992). In another oft-cited work from the 1980s, we are given another typology. In 1986, Metts and Chronis proposed another four types and in 1989 Metts asserted that regardless of the differences in semantics, all the “taxonomies” to date reflected a similarity in the formulation of deceptive messages. Metts states “the observable variation in deceptive message design reflects “a continuum of covert to overt misrepresentation of information.” (McCornack et al., 1992) Finally, you have Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT) introduced in 1988 by David Buller and Judee Burgoon, which proposes that deception is a distinct communicative process that relies on interaction between the sender and receiver. IDT focuses on emotion both as a motivator and message in the process as well as the mechanical aspects of how that communication takes place (Buller and Burgoon 1998).\n\nInformation manipulation theory departs from Interpersonal Deception Theory in the substance of the focus of its studies. Whereas Interpersonal Deception Theory (IDT) spends more time studying the physiological challenges and channels of communication involved in the detection of deceptive messages, information manipulation theory is more involved with the content of the messages and why they are employed. This is a distinction that can be examined in terms of how these theories approach the divergence from communication norms. IDT is more involved with the physical and biological deviation of normal behavior exhibited in communication. IMT is more fixed on the departure from conversational standards. Both theories aimed at discovering more about the relational effect of discovering that an act of deception has taken place.\n\nBefore the advent of information manipulation theory, researchers were not interested in the formulation or design of the deceptive message. Previous studies on deception were more concerned with the mode of communication because deception was thought to occur in typical human interactions in unnatural polarized ways. Additionally, use of recollection as a method generating “normal” cognitive examples of deception scenarios further led to this dichotomous perspective. Truth in communication was thought to be clear or unclear. Bavelas et al. (1990) speak to this issue (McCornack 1992). Deception was also viewed to have manifested as either one of two of things: a type or a strategy. McCornack sought to depart from that and present another argument for how deceptive messages might be analyzed. IMT recognizes deception as a unique mode of communication that departs from more traditional, rational communicative behavior. IMT is more directed at answering the question of how a sender might go about engaging in the development and dispensation of a deceptive message and what about that process makes it more or less deceptive (McCornack 1992).\n\nInformation manipulation theory proposes that in any given conversation there exists a set of basic, reasonable assumptions about how transmission of information occurs. This premise is based on the work of Paul Grice. Taken from his speeches in 1967 to writings in 1975 and 1989, Grice promoted notions regarding language usage that has come to be known as his theory of “conversational implicature” (CI) (McCornack 1992).\n\nJacobs, Dawson and Brashers (1996) recount Grice stating “communication is made possible by communicators’ mutually orienting toward general principles of cooperation and rationality.” The vehicles that deliver CI are what Grice refers to as conversational maxims (CM). CM can be used as dimensions to determine the degree of deceptiveness.\n\n\nThese maxims are as follows:\n(McCornack 1992)\n\n\nGrice posits that the resulting ‘norm’ that arises from adherence to CM is by virtue of what is called the Cooperative Principle (CP).\n\nThese maxims are only totally adhered to in what is called ‘a philosopher’s paradise’ but generally these maxims can be adhered to within a conversational context. Grice calls the obvious real world violation of a CM as “flouts”; when one CM opposes another, this is referred to as a “clash” (Jacobs et al. 1996). In the case of the former this violation can happen “quietly.”\nIt is a major tenet of IMT that the subtle and covert nature of these violations of conversational norm assumptions is precisely what makes a message deceptive. A message can be identified in terms of its deceptiveness dependent on where it is measured according to the dimensions of the conversational maxims (McCornack 1992).\n\n\n\nIMT as it is applied in cultural contexts varies. When evaluating Western culture it was discovered that all methods of manipulation were viewed as deceptive with manipulation of quality rated as most deceptive. Conversely, IMT participants in Hong Kong only rated statements involved with quality and/or relevance as more manipulative and deceptive (Zhou & Lutterbie 2005). Both researchers agree that the Bottom-Up approach is an effective method for examining general patterns of deception across cultures while the Top-Down approach can account for situational variations to explain deceptive behavior patterns in order to create an applicable cross-cultural IMT model.\n\n\nResearch suggests young children's view of how information is perceived as deceptive varies as children grow older. This variation in moral judgment suggests that moral development is critical in perceptions of right or wrong. As individuals experience a series of (moral) developmental stages such as avoiding punishment, gaining rewards, identifying individual duty role in society to meet expectations of others (Zhou & Lutterbie 2005), different behavior modeling criteria is established through communication situations that cognitively stimulates and challenges moral judgment. These stages, frequency and types of development models are theorized to be more or less universal across cultures. However, moral judgment in IMT should be reserved for other communication theory that more distinctly addresses broad, generic cultural criteria patterns and specific requirements of societies to establish what does or does not covertly violate global conversational maxims.\n\nIMT supports the idea that deception may or may not be detectable. When participants are asked to rate message features like how much information was false, omitted, equivocal and/or irrelevant, researchers can reasonably measure and describe such multidimensional deceptive messages. However, the measurability results and conceptual meaning of degrees of deception and its impact is unclear (Levine, Asada & Lindsey 2003). Information that is manipulated on a continuum from trivial deception to important deception can range from socially acceptable to morally reprehensible. The more severe lies are rated, the more deceptive the lies than inconsequential ones. Deceiving others about important information is more likely to result in adverse moral judgment and/or moral condemnation.\n\nThe most significant criticism of information manipulation theory has come in the form of the following two arguments:\n\n\nBavelas, J.B., Black, A., Chovil, N., & Mullett, J.

His work often deals with themes such as death, corpses (and sometimes dismembered portions thereof), and various outsiders such as people with dwarfism, transgender and intersex persons, as well as physically deformed people. Witkin's complex tableaux often recall religious episodes or classical paintings.\n\nWitkin was born to a Jewish father and Roman Catholic mother. His twin brother, Jerome Witkin, and son Kersen Witkin, are also painters. Witkin's parents divorced when he was young because they were unable to overcome their religious differences. He attended grammar school at Saint Cecelia's in Brooklyn and went on to Grover Cleveland High School. In 1961 Witkin enlisted in the United States Army with the intention of capturing war photography during the Vietnam war. However, due to scheduling conflicts, Witkin never saw combat in Vietnam. Witkin spent his military time at Fort Hood, Texas, and was mostly in charge of Public Information and classified photos. In 1967, he became the official photographer for City Walls Inc. He attended Cooper Union in New York, where he studied sculpture, attaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974. Columbia University granted him a scholarship for graduate school, but his Master of Fine Arts degree is from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque\n\nWitkin claims that his vision and sensibility spring from an episode he witnessed as a young child, an automobile accident in front of his house in which a little girl was decapitated.\n\nHe says his family's difficulties also influenced his work. His favorite artist is Giotto. His photographic techniques draw on early Daguerreotypes and on the work of E. J. Bellocq.\n\nThose of Witkin's works which use corpses have had to be created in Mexico in order to get around restrictive US laws. Because of the transgressive nature of the contents of his images, his works have been labelled exploitative and have sometimes shocked public opinion.\n\nHis techniques include scratching the negative, bleaching or toning the print, and using a hands-in-the-chemicals printing technique. This experimentation began after seeing a 19th-century ambrotype of a woman and her ex-lover who had been scratched from the frame.\n\nJoel-Peter Witkin's photograph \"Sanitarium\" inspired the final presentation of Alexander McQueen's Spring/Summer 2001 collection based on avian imagery, the walls of another box within the faux psychiatric ward collapsed to reveal a startling tableau vivant: a reclining, masked nude breathing through a tube and surrounded by fluttering moths.\n\nIn July 2011, filming began on the feature-length documentary, . The film, directed by Thomas Marino, examines Witkin's life and photographs. Along with interviews with Joel-Peter Witkin, the film features interviews from gallery owners, prominent artists, photographers, and scholars who share insight into the impact of Witkin's work and influence on modern culture. Filming took place in Albuquerque, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris. The film was released on July 6, 2013 for digital download and streaming/rental. The film will be part of the permanent collections at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris, France, and the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile in Santiago, Chile.\n\n\"Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye\" was first publicly shown in Santiago, Chile at the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile on July 31, 2013, as part of the opening of the exhibition, \"Vanitas: Joel-Peter Witkin en Chile\".

They were devout Protestants with a history of service as civil servants to the Duchy of Württemberg. Moser's father was Johann Jacob Moser of Filseck (born 1660 in Stuttgart, died 1716), and his mother was Helene Catharine \"née\" Misler (born 1672 in Stade, died 1741 in Stuttgart).\n\nMoser was born and died in Stuttgart. He had six brothers and sisters but his parents managed to fund his pursuit of an academic career. After attending Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium,\n\nMoser studied state journalism at the University of Tübingen. He was mostly self-taught and at 18 years of age he became a professor of the law faculty. However he found his income insufficient, and he so that it had to look around for other possibilities. he studied at the University of Tübingen, and was brilliant enough to be already at the age of 19 appointed a professor of Law in the same university.\n\nIn 1721 Moser married Friederike Rosine Vischer, daughter of a Württembergian Upper Council President. Their oldest son, Friedrich Karl von Moser, was born on 18 December 1723 in Stuttgart, and became a jurist, political writer and a statesman.\n\nFrom 1721-1726 he worked in Vienna. In 1724 he became an adviser to the state vice-chancellor Count Schönborn. Moser was not able to pursue a career in the imperial service, because he refused to convert to Catholicism. Soon afterwards he entered the civil service of the Holy Roman Empire, and was appointed as a \"state adviser\" in the Imperial Court. In 1726 Moser returned to Stuttgart as a government advisor. In 1727 he was appointed professor at the Tübingen Collegium. The job conflicted with his role as a government advisor and he quit (which job?) in 1732. He held a long series of administrative appointments, giving him a thorough knowledge of political and constitutional issues.\n\nIn 1736 he was called to head the Faculty of Law at the University of Frankfurt (Oder), but had to leave after three years due to his thoroughly Liberal ideas which were disliked by King Frederick William I of Prussia. Between 1739 and 1751, he had various jobs.\n\nHe spent the years 1739 to 1747 at Ebersdorf, mainly concerned with completing the monumental 53 volumes of his \"Deutsches Staatsrecht\" (\"German Constitutional Law\"), a pioneering research analysing the named subject matter more systematically than ever done before, and based on a through study of the sources.\n\nIn 1751 Moser became a consultant on land reform to the Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg. He came into conflict with the Duke by opposing the Duke's absolutist tendencies. In July 1759 he was arrested and imprisoned without judicial procedure in solitary confinement in the fortress Hohentwiel, on the charge of authoring subversive writings. He completed his five-year detention with his mental and physical health and his faith in god unbroken. In order to meet his desire to write, without writing materials, he wrote religious songs on the walls with soot from the fireplace on the walls. In 1764, aged 63, he was released, in part due to the intercession of Friedrich the Great of Prussia, and was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles.\n\nIn 1764 he was released, due in part to the intercession of Friedrich the Great of Prussia (son of the king who had hounded Moser in 1739). He was rehabilitated and restored to his position, rank and titles. He retired on 16 July 1770 aged 69. During the next 15 years, he wrote many books. Over his entire life he wrote 500-600 books. This prolific output led sometimes to careless representations of the facts in his works.\n\nJohann Jacob Moser wrote the first description of the German state based not on abstract principles but on concrete legal rules and judicial decisions. He collected material and organised it systematically. Thus he argued against the deductive systems of natural law advocated by Christian Thomasius (1655-1728) and Christian Wolff (1679-1754). He gave the same treatment to international law, describing how it was actually practiced, rather than attempting to derive it from nature. Moser is considered as laying the foundations for the modern German state and positive international law. He defended the traditional order by defending actual legal rules.\n\nApart from his work on state law, he was also interested in the local law of the numerous territories of the state. However, because of their great variety, he was not able to describe them with the same comprehensiveness.\n\nAmong his important later works can be mentioned \"Neues deutsches Staatsrecht\", (\"New German Constitutional Law\"), published in 24 volumes between 1766 and 1782. His overall ouvre includes about 500 works, on law as well as theology.\n\n"}

The site was first inhabited in the 11th century by a settlement of Kurdish troops garrisoned there by the Mirdasids. As a result, it was known as \"Hisn al-Akrad\", meaning the \"Castle of the Kurds\". In 1142 it was given by Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, to the Knights Hospitaller. It remained in their possession until it fell in 1271. It became known as \"Crac de l'Ospital\"; the name \"Krak des Chevaliers\" was coined in the 19th century.\n\nThe Hospitallers began rebuilding the castle in the 1140s and were finished by 1170 when an earthquake damaged the castle. The order controlled a number of castles along the border of the County of Tripoli, a state founded after the First Crusade. Krak des Chevaliers was among the most important, and acted as a center of administration as well as a military base. After a second phase of building was undertaken in the 13th century, Krak des Chevaliers became a concentric castle. This phase created the outer wall and gave the castle its current appearance. The first half of the century has been described as Krak des Chevaliers' \"golden age\". At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to exact tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse and in 1271 Mamluk Sultan Baibars captured Krak des Chevaliers after a siege lasting 36 days, supposedly by way of a forged letter purportedly from the Hospitallers' Grand Master that caused the Knights to surrender.\n\nRenewed interest in Crusader castles in the 19th century led to the investigation of Krak des Chevaliers, and architectural plans were drawn up. In the late 19th or early 20th century a settlement had been created within the castle, causing damage to its fabric. The 500 inhabitants were moved in 1933 and the castle was given over to the French state, which carried out a program of clearing and restoration. When Syria declared independence in 1946, it assumed control. \n\nToday, a village called al-Husn exists around the castle and has a population of nearly 9,000. Krak des Chevaliers is located approximately west of the city of Homs, close to the border of Lebanon, and is administratively part of the Homs Governorate. Since 2006, the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Qal'at Salah El-Din have been recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. It was partially damaged in the Syrian civil war from shelling and recaptured by the Syrian government forces in 2014. Since then, reconstruction and conservation work on the site had begun. Reports by the UNESCO and the Syrian government on the state of the site are produced yearly.\n\nThe modern Arabic word for a castle is \"Kalaa\" (), but Krak des Chavaliers is known as a \"Hosn\" (), or \"fort\". This derives from the name of an earlier fortification on the same site called \"Ḥoṣn al-Akrād\" (), meaning \"fort of the Kurds\". It was called by the Franks and then by a confusion with \"karak\" (fortress), . \"Crat\" was probably the Frankish version of \"Akrād\", the word for Kurds. After the Knights Hospitaller took control of the castle, it became known as ; the name (alternatively spelt ) was introduced by Guillaume Rey in the 19th century.\n\nThe castle sits atop a hill east of Tartus, Syria, in the Homs Gap. On the other side of the gap, away, was the 12th-century Gibelacar Castle (Hisn Ibn Akkar). The route through the strategically important Homs Gap connects the cities of Tripoli and Homs. To the north of the castle lies the Jebel Ansariyah, and to the south Lebanon. The surrounding area is fertile, benefiting from streams and abundant rainfall. Compared to the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the other Crusader states had less land suitable for farming; however, the limestone peaks of Tripoli were well-suited to defensive sites.\n\nProperty in the County of Tripoli, granted to the Knights in the 1140s, included the Krak des Chevaliers, the towns of Rafanea and Montferrand, and the Beqa'a plain separating Homs and Tripoli. Homs was never under Crusader control, so the region around the Krak des Chevaliers was vulnerable to expeditions from the city. While its proximity caused the Knights problems with regard to defending their territory, it also meant Homs was close enough for them to raid. Because of the castle's command of the plain, it became the Knights' most important base in the area.\n\nAccording to the 13th-century Arab historian Ibn Shaddad, in 1031, the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo and Homs, Shibl ad-Dawla Nasr, established a settlement of Kurdish tribesmen at the site of the castle, which was then known as \"Ḥiṣn al-Safḥ\". Nasr restored Hisn al-Safh to help reestablish the Mirdasids' access to the coast of Tripoli after they lost nearby Hisn Ibn Akkar to the Fatimids in 1029. Due to Nasr's garrisoning of Kurdish troops at the site, the castle became known as \"Ḥiṣn al-Akrād\" (Castle of the Kurds). The castle was strategically located at the southern edge of the Jibal al-Alawiyin mountain range and dominated the road between Homs and Tripoli. When building castles, engineers often chose elevated sites, such as hills and mountains, that provided natural obstacles.\n\nIn January 1099 on the journey to Jerusalem during the First Crusade, the company of Raymond IV of Toulouse came under attack from the garrison of Hisn al-Akrad, the forerunner of the Krak, who harried Raymond's foragers. The following day Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February of the same year but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in 1110 when Tancred, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace of this first castle survives at the site.\n\nThe origins of the Knights Hospitaller are unclear, but the order probably emerged around the 1070s in Jerusalem. It started as a religious order which cared for the sick, and later looked after pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the success of the First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem in 1099, many crusaders donated their new property in the Levant to the Hospital of St John. Early donations were in the newly formed Kingdom of Jerusalem, but over time the order extended its holdings to the Crusader states of the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch. Evidence suggests that in the 1130s the order became militarised when Fulk, King of Jerusalem, granted the newly built castle at Beth Gibelin to the order in 1136. A papal bull from between 1139 and 1143 may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims. There were also other military orders, such as the Knights Templar, which offered protection to pilgrims.\nBetween 1142 and 1144 Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, granted the order property in the county. According to historian Jonathan Riley-Smith, the Hospitallers effectively established a \"palatinate\" within Tripoli. The property included castles with which the Hospitallers were expected to defend Tripoli. Along with Krak des Chevaliers, the Hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state which allowed the order to dominate the area. The order's agreement with Raymond II stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign, the spoils belonged entirely to the order, and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order. Raymond II could further not make peace with the Muslims without the permission of the Hospitallers. The Hospitallers made Krak des Chevaliers a center of administration for their new property, undertaking work at the castle that would make it one of the most elaborate Crusader fortifications in the Levant.\n\nAfter acquiring the site in 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle's chapel, which was replaced by the present chapel. In 1163 the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.\n\nDrought conditions between 1175 and 1180 prompted the Crusaders to sign a two-year truce with the Muslims, but without Tripoli included in the terms. During the 1180s, raids by Christians and Muslims into each other's territory became more frequent. In 1180, Saladin ventured into the County of Tripoli, ravaging the area. Unwilling to meet him in open battle, the Crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications. Without capturing the castles, Saladin could not secure control of the area, and once he retreated the Hospitallers were able to revitalise their damaged lands. The Battle of Hattin in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the Crusaders: Guy of Lusignan, King of Jerusalem, was captured, as was the True Cross, a relic discovered during the First Crusade. Afterwards Saladin ordered the execution of the captured Templar and Hospitaller knights, such was the importance of the two orders in defending the Crusader states. After the battle, the Hospitaller castles of Belmont, Belvoir, and Bethgibelin fell to Muslim armies. Following these losses, the Order focused its attention on its castles in Tripoli. In May 1188 Saladin led an army to attack Krak des Chevaliers, but on seeing the castle decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the Hospitaller castle of Margat, which he also failed to capture.\n\nAnother earthquake struck in 1202, and it may have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace of it has been discovered.\n\nThe first half of the 13th century has been characterised as Krak des Chevaliers' \"golden age\". While other Crusader strongholds came under threat, Krak des Chevaliers and its garrison of 2,000 soldiers dominated the surrounding area. It was effectively the center of a principality which remained in Crusader hands until 1271 and was the only major inland area to remain constantly under Crusader control during this period. Crusaders who passed through the area would often stop at the castle, and probably made donations. King Andrew II of Hungary visited in 1218 and proclaimed the castle the \"key of the Christian lands\". He was so impressed with the castle that he gave a yearly income of 60 marks to the Master and 40 to the brothers. Geoffroy de Joinville, uncle of the noted chronicler of the Crusades Jean de Joinville, died at Krak des Chevaliers in 1203 or 1204 and was buried in the castle's chapel.\n\nThe main contemporary accounts relating to Krak des Chevaliers are of Muslim origin and tend to emphasise Muslim success while overlooking setbacks against the Crusaders although they suggest that the Knights Hospitaller forced the settlements of Hama and Homs to pay tribute to the Order. This situation lasted as long as Saladin's successors warred between themselves. The proximity of Krak des Chevaliers to Muslim territories allowed it to take on an offensive role, acting as a base from which neighboring areas could be attacked. By 1203 the garrison were making raids on Montferrand (which was under Muslim control) and Hama, and in 1207 and 1208 the castle's soldiers took part in an attack on Homs. Krak des Chevaliers acted as a base for expeditions to Hama in 1230 and 1233 after the amir refused to pay tribute. The former was unsuccessful, but the 1233 expedition was a show of force that demonstrated the importance of Krak des Chevaliers.\n\nIn the 1250s, the fortunes of the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers took a turn for the worse. A Muslim army estimated to number 10,000 men ravaged the countryside around the castle in 1252 after which the Order's finances declined sharply. In 1268 Master Hugh Revel complained that the area, previously home to around 10,000 people, now stood deserted and that the Order's property in the Kingdom of Jerusalem produced little income. He also noted that by this point there were only 300 of the Order's brethren left in the east. On the Muslim side, in 1260 Baibars became Sultan of Egypt, following his overthrow of the incumbent ruler Qutuz, and went on to unite Egypt and Syria. As a result, Muslim settlements that had previously paid tribute to the Hospitallers at Krak des Chevaliers no longer felt intimidated into doing so.\n\nBaibars ventured into the area around Krak des Chevaliers in 1270 and allowed his men to graze their animals on the fields around the castle. When he received news that year of the Eighth Crusade led by King Louis IX of France, Baibars left for Cairo to avoid a confrontation. After Louis died in 1271 Baibars returned to deal with Krak des Chevaliers. Before he marched on the castle the Sultan captured the smaller castles in the area, including Chastel Blanc. On 3 March, Baibars' army arrived at Krak des Chevaliers. By the time the Sultan appeared on the scene, the castle may already have been blockaded by Mamluk forces for several days. Of the three Arabic accounts of the siege only one was contemporary, that of Ibn Shaddad, although he was not present at the siege. Peasants who lived in the area had fled to the castle for safety and were kept in the outer ward. As soon as Baibars arrived he erected mangonels, powerful siege weapons which he would later turn on the castle. In a probable reference to a walled suburb outside the castle's entrance, Ibn Shaddad records that two days later the first line of defences fell to the besiegers.\n\nRain interrupted the siege, but on 21 March, immediately south of Krak des Chevaliers, Baibar's forces captured a triangular outwork possibly defended by a timber palisade. On 29 March, the attackers undermined a tower in the southwest corner causing it to collapse whereupon Baibars' army attacked through the breach. In the outer ward they encountered the peasants who had sought refuge in the castle. Though the outer ward had fallen, with a handful of the garrison killed in the process, the Crusaders retreated to the more formidable inner ward. After a lull of ten days, the besiegers conveyed a letter to the garrison, supposedly from the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Tripoli, which granted permission for them to surrender. Although the letter was a forgery, the garrison capitulated and the Sultan spared their lives. The new owners of the castle undertook repairs, focused mainly on the outer ward. The Hospitaller chapel was converted to a mosque and two \"mihrabs\" (prayer niches) were added to the interior.\n\nAfter the Franks were driven from the Holy Land in 1291, European familiarity with the castles of the Crusades declined. It was not until the 19th century that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles in the Holy Land. In 1871 he published the work \"Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre\"; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.\n\nPaul Deschamps visited the castle in February 1927. Since Rey had visited in the 19th century a village of 500 people had been established within the castle. Renewed inhabitation had damaged the site: underground vaults had been used as rubbish tips and in some places the battlements had been destroyed. Deschamps and fellow architect François Anus attempted to clear some of the detritus; General Maurice Gamelin assigned 60 Alawite soldiers to help. Deschamps left in March 1927, and work resumed when he returned two years later. The culmination of Deschamp's work at the castle was the publication of \"Les Châteaux des Croisés en Terre Sainte I: le Crac des Chevaliers\" in 1934, with detailed plans by Anus. The survey has been widely praised, described as \"brilliant and exhaustive\" by military historian D. J. Cathcart King in 1949 and \"perhaps the finest account of the archaeology and history of a single medieval castle ever written\" by historian Hugh Kennedy in 1994.\n\nAs early as 1929 there were suggestions that the castle should be taken under French control. On 16 November 1933 Krak des Chevaliers was given into the control of the French state, and cared for by the Académie des Beaux-Arts. The villagers were moved and paid F1 million between them in compensation. Over the following two years a programme of cleaning and restoration was carried out by a force of 120 workers. Once finished, Krak des Chevaliers was one of the key tourist attractions in the French Levant. Pierre Coupel, who had undertaken similar work at the Tower of the Lions and the two castles at Sidon, supervised the work. Despite the restoration, no archaeological excavations were carried out. The French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon, which had been established in 1920, ended in 1946 with the declaration of Syrian independence. The castle was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, along with Qal’at Salah El-Din, in 2006, and is owned by the Syrian government.\n\nSeveral of the castle's former residents built their houses outside the fortress and a village called al-Husn has since developed. Many of the al-Husn's roughly 9,000 Muslim residents benefit economically from the tourism generated by the site.\n\nDuring the Syrian Civil War which began in 2011, UNESCO voiced concerns that the war might lead to the damage of important cultural sites such as Krak des Chevaliers. It has been reported that the castle was shelled in August 2012 by the Syrian Arab Army, and the Crusader chapel has been damaged. The castle was reported to have been damaged in July 2013 by an airstrike during the Siege of Homs, and once more on 18 August 2013 it was clearly damaged yet the amount of destruction is unknown. The Syrian Arab Army recaptured the castle and the village of al-Hosn from rebel forces on March 20, 2014. Since then, both the UNESCO and the Syrian government have produced periodic reports about the state of the site, required reconstruction and conservation measures, and advance in these.\n\nWriting in the early 20th century, T. E. Lawrence, popularly known as Lawrence of Arabia, remarked that Krak des Chevaliers was \"perhaps the best preserved and most wholly admirable castle in the world, [a castle which] forms a fitting commentary on any account of the Crusading buildings of Syria\". Castles in Europe provided lordly accommodation for their owners and were centers of administration; in the Levant the need for defence was paramount and was reflected in castle design. Kennedy suggests that \"The castle scientifically designed as a fighting machine surely reached its apogee in great buildings like Margat and Crac des Chevaliers.\"\n\nKrak des Chevaliers can be classified both as a spur castle, due to its site, and after the 13th-century expansion a fully developed concentric castle. It was similar in size and layout to Vadum Jacob, a Crusader castle built in the late 1170s. Margat has also been cited as Krak des Chevaliers' sister castle. The main building material at Krak des Chevaliers was limestone; the ashlar facing is so fine that the mortar is barely noticeable. Outside the castle's entrance was a \"walled suburb\" known as a \"burgus\", no trace of which remains. To the south of the outer ward was a triangular outwork and the Crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it. It is unknown how it was defended at the time of the 1271 siege, though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber palisade. South of the castle the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill, so that siege engines can approach on level ground. The inner defences are strongest at this point, with a cluster of towers connected by a thick wall.\n\nBetween 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller undertook a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers on the eastern side, and there was a postern gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction.\n\nWhen Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13th century, new walls surrounding the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, with a narrow gap between them in the west and south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could unleash missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. Machicolations were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an aqueduct. It acted both as a moat and water supply for the castle.\n\nAt the north end of the small courtyard is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage and could have acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12th century, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.\n\nThe current chapel was probably built to replace the one destroyed by an earthquake in 1170. Only the east end of the original chapel, which housed the apse, and a small part of the south wall survive from the original chapel. The later chapel had a barrel vault and an uncomplicated apse; its design would have been considered outmoded by contemporary standards in France, but bears similarities to that built around 1186 at Margat. It was divided into three roughly equal bays. A cornice runs round the chapel at the point where the vault ends and the wall begins. Oriented roughly east to west, it was long and wide with the main entrance from the west and a second smaller one in the north wall. When the castle was remodelled in the early 13th century, the entrance was moved to the south wall. The chapel was lit by windows above the cornice, one at the west end, one on either side of the east bay, and one on the south side of the central bay, and the apse at the east end had a large window. In 1935 a second chapel was discovered outside the castle's main entrance, however it no longer survives.\n\nThe second phase of building work undertaken by the Hospitallers began in the early 13th century and lasted decades. The outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site, lending the Krak des Chevaliers its current appearance. Standing high, the outer circuit had towers that projected strongly from the wall. While the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall, the towers of the 13th-century outer walls were rounded. This design was new and even contemporary Templar castles did not have rounded towers. The technique was developed at Château Gaillard in France by Richard the Lionheart between 1196 and 1198. The extension to the southeast is of lesser quality than the rest of the circuit and was built at an unknown date. Probably around the 1250s a postern was added to the north wall.\n\nArrow slits in the walls and towers were distributed to minimise the amount of dead ground around the castle. Machicolations crowned the walls, offering defenders a way to hurl projectiles towards enemies at the foot of the wall. They were so cramped archers would have had to crouch inside them. The box machicolations were unusual: those at Krak des Chevaliers were more complex that those at Saône or Margat and there were no comparable features amongst Crusader castles. However, they bore similarities to Muslim work, such as the contemporary defences at the Citadel of Aleppo. It is unclear which side imitated the other, as the date they were added to Krak des Chevaliers is unknown, but it does provide evidence for the diffusion of military ideas between the Muslim and Christian armies. These defences were accessed by a wall-walk known as a chemin de ronde. In the opinion of historian Hugh Kennedy the defences of the outer wall were \"the most elaborate and developed anywhere in the Latin east ... the whole structure is a brilliantly designed and superbly built fighting machine\".\n\nWhen the outer walls were built in the 13th century the main entrance was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for , and along its length were murder-holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.\n\nDespite its predominantly military character, the castle is one of the few sites where Crusader art (in the form of frescoes) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white-wash had decayed. The frescos were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian Jaroslav Folda noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170–1202 rebuild. Mold, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess. The one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.\n\n\n\n\n"}

'Alan' Watson to indicate the moving of a rule or a system of law from one country to another (A. Watson, \"Legal Transplants: An Approach to Comparative Law\", Edinburgh, 1974). The notion of legal transplantation is diffusionism-based and according to this concept most changes in most legal systems occur as the result of borrowing. As maintained by Watson, transplantation is the most fertile source of legal development.\n\nLaws are commonly inspired by foreign policies and experiences. Regardless of the academic discourses on whether legal transplants are sustainable as a notion in the legal theory, they are common practice. Nevertheless, the degree to which new laws are inspired by foreign examples can vary. A frequent and often justified criticism is that imported laws are not suited for a certain local context.\n\nGerman jurist Friedrich Carl von Savigny and his historical school of jurisprudence, which was inspired by the 19th-century Romanticism, have notably promoted the origins of the German people and their distinctive ethos, or Volksgeist (“the spirit of a people”). Savigny’s school of legal thought expressed the need of legal change to respect the continuity of the Volksgeist offering a pre-Darwinian concept of juristic evolution. However, this concept of juristic evolution did not leave much space for notions such as legal transplants and the diffusion of law. More recently, Pierre Legrand is one of the strongest opponents of legal transplants.\n\nToday, legal transplants are often mentioned in the broader process of diffusion of law or legal acculturation. J.W. Powell is credited with coining the word “acculturation”, first using it in an 1880 report by the US Bureau of American Ethnography. He explained that this term refers to the psychological changes induced by cross-cultural imitation. In a broader context, such notion is by many contemporary scholars applied to legal thought. The diffusion of law is a process of legal change in today’s age of globalization. Studies on diffusion of law are notably a new area of research in the 21st century.\n\n"}

{"id": "51119", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51119", "title": "Literary theory", "text": "Literary theory\n\nLiterary theory in a strict sense is the systematic study of the nature of literature and of the methods for analyzing literature. However, literary scholarship since the 19th century often includes—in addition to, or even instead of literary theory in the strict sense—considerations of intellectual history, moral philosophy, social prophecy, and other interdisciplinary themes which are of relevance to the way humans interpret meaning. In the humanities in modern academia, the latter style of scholarship is an outgrowth of critical theory and is often called simply \"theory\".\nAs a consequence, the word \"theory\" has become an umbrella term for a variety of scholarly approaches to reading texts. Many of these approaches are informed by various strands of Continental philosophy and of sociology.\n\nThe practice of literary theory became a profession in the 20th century, but it has historical roots that run as far back as ancient Greece (Aristotle's \"Poetics\" is an often cited early example), ancient India (Bharata Muni's \"Natya Shastra\"), ancient Rome (Longinus's \"On the Sublime\") and medieval Iraq (Al-Jahiz's \"al-Bayan wa-'l-tabyin\" and \"al-Hayawan\", and ibn al-Mu'tazz's \"Kitab al-Badi\"). The aesthetic theories of philosophers from ancient philosophy through the 18th and 19th centuries are important influences on current literary study. The theory and criticism of literature are, of course, also closely tied to the history of literature.\n\nHowever, the modern sense of \"literary theory\" only dates to approximately the 1950s when the structuralist linguistics of Ferdinand de Saussure began to strongly influence English language literary criticism. The New Critics and various European-influenced formalists (particularly the Russian Formalists) had described some of their more abstract efforts as \"theoretical\" as well. But it was not until the broad impact of structuralism began to be felt in the English-speaking academic world that \"literary theory\" was thought of as a unified domain.\n\nIn the academic world of the United Kingdom and the United States, literary theory was at its most popular from the late 1960s (when its influence was beginning to spread outward from elite universities like Johns Hopkins, Yale, and Cornell) through the 1980s (by which time it was taught nearly everywhere in some form). During this span of time, literary theory was perceived as academically cutting-edge, and most university literature departments sought to teach and study theory and incorporate it into their curricula. Because of its meteoric rise in popularity and the difficult language of its key texts, theory was also often criticized as faddish or trendy obscurantism (and many academic satire novels of the period, such as those by David Lodge, feature theory prominently). Some scholars, both theoretical and anti-theoretical, refer to the 1970s and 1980s debates on the academic merits of theory as \"the theory wars\".\n\nBy the early 1990s, the popularity of \"theory\" as a subject of interest by itself was declining slightly (along with job openings for pure \"theorists\") even as the texts of literary theory were incorporated into the study of almost all literature. By 2010, the controversy over the use of theory in literary studies had quieted down, and discussions on the topic within literary and cultural studies tend now to be considerably milder and less lively. However, some scholars like Mark Bauerlein continue to argue that less capable theorists have abandoned proven methods of epistemology, resulting in persistent lapses in learning, research, and evaluation. Some scholars do draw heavily on theory in their work, while others only mention it in passing or not at all; but it is an acknowledged, important part of the study of literature.\n\nOne of the fundamental questions of literary theory is \"what is literature?\" – although many contemporary theorists and literary scholars believe either that \"literature\" cannot be defined or that it can refer to any use of language. Specific theories are distinguished not only by their methods and conclusions, but even by how they create meaning in a \"text\". However, some theorists acknowledge that these texts do not have a singular, fixed meaning which is deemed \"correct\".\n\nSince theorists of literature often draw on a very heterogeneous tradition of Continental philosophy and the philosophy of language, any classification of their approaches is only an approximation. There are many types of literary theory, which take different approaches to texts. Even among those listed below, many scholars combine methods from more than one of these approaches (for instance, the deconstructive approach of Paul de Man drew on a long tradition of close reading pioneered by the New Critics, and de Man was trained in the European hermeneutic tradition).\n\nBroad schools of theory that have historically been important include historical and biographical criticism, New Criticism, formalism, Russian formalism, and structuralism, post-structuralism, Marxism, feminism and French feminism, post-colonialism, new historicism, deconstruction, reader-response criticism, and psychoanalytic criticism.\n\nThe different interpretive and epistemological perspectives of different schools of theory often arise from, and so give support to, different moral and political commitments. For instance, the work of the New Critics often contained an implicit moral dimension, and sometimes even a religious one: a New Critic might read a poem by T. S. Eliot or Gerard Manley Hopkins for its degree of honesty in expressing the torment and contradiction of a serious search for belief in the modern world. Meanwhile, a Marxist critic might find such judgments merely ideological rather than critical; the Marxist would say that the New Critical reading did not keep enough critical distance from the poem's religious stance to be able to understand it. Or a post-structuralist critic might simply avoid the issue by understanding the religious meaning of a poem as an allegory of meaning, treating the poem's references to \"God\" by discussing their referential nature rather than what they refer to. A critic using Darwinian literary studies might use arguments from the evolutionary psychology of religion.\n\nSuch a disagreement cannot be easily resolved, because it is inherent in the radically different terms and goals (that is, the theories) of the critics. Their theories of reading derive from vastly different intellectual traditions: the New Critic bases his work on an East-Coast American scholarly and religious tradition, while the Marxist derives his thought from a body of critical social and economic thought, the post-structuralist's work emerges from twentieth-century Continental philosophy of language, and the Darwinian from the modern evolutionary synthesis. To expect such different approaches to have much in common would be naïve; so calling them all \"theories of literature\" without acknowledging their heterogeneity is itself a reduction of their differences.\n\nIn the late 1950s, the Canadian literary critic Northrop Frye attempted to establish an approach for reconciling historical criticism and New Criticism while addressing concerns of early reader-response and numerous psychological and social approaches. His approach, laid out in his \"Anatomy of Criticism\", was explicitly structuralist, relying on the assumption of an intertextual \"order of words\" and universality of certain structural types. His approach held sway in English literature programs for several decades but lost favor during the ascendance of post-structuralism.\n\nFor some theories of literature (especially certain kinds of formalism), the distinction between \"literary\" and other sorts of texts is of paramount importance. Other schools (particularly post-structuralism in its various forms: new historicism, deconstruction, some strains of Marxism and feminism) have sought to break down distinctions between the two and have applied the tools of textual interpretation to a wide range of \"texts\", including film, non-fiction, historical writing, and even cultural events.\n\nMikhail Bakhtin argued that the \"utter inadequacy\" of literary theory is evident when it is forced to deal with the novel; while other genres are fairly stabilized, the novel is still developing.\n\nAnother crucial distinction among the various theories of literary interpretation is intentionality, the amount of weight given to the author's own opinions about and intentions for a work. For most pre-20th century approaches, the author's intentions are a guiding factor and an important determiner of the \"correct\" interpretation of texts. The New Criticism was the first school to disavow the role of the author in interpreting texts, preferring to focus on \"the text itself\" in a close reading. In fact, as much contention as there is between formalism and later schools, they share the tenet that the author's interpretation of a work is no more inherently meaningful than any other.\n\nListed below are some of the most commonly identified schools of literary theory, along with their major authors. In many cases, such as those of the historian and philosopher Michel Foucault and the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, the authors were not primarily literary critics, but their work has been broadly influential in literary theory.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

On its sides are a number of pre-Hispanic structures built on terraces built into the hill. The main structures are at the top. This is one of the most important Aztec sites and was discovered in 1933, and explored by José Garía Payón in 1935. The visible complex dates from the Aztec Empire but the site’s use as a ceremonial center appears to be much older. The sanctuary complex was built from the mid 15th century to the beginnings of the 16th. To get to the Cerro de los Idolos one must climb 426 stairs up 125 meters. Along the stairway leading to the site, there are signs with area’s history written in Spanish, English and Nahuatl. The site contains six buildings. The Cuauhcalli or House of the Eagles, which dates from 1501, is the main building, which is significant in that it is carved out of the hill itself. The building is in the shape of a truncated pyramid, built this way due to the lack of space on the hill. The monolithic Cuauhcalli has been compared to the Ellora in India, Petra on the shores of the Dead Sea and Abu Simbel in Egypt. This was a sanctuary for the Eagle Warriors for rites such as initiation. A thirteen-step staircase leading into this temple is flanked by side struts. and two feline sculptures that face the plaza in front. The Cuauhcalli consists of two rooms, one rectangular and the other circular, with an opening in the wall between the two. After being carved out of the rock, the walls and ceiling were covered in stucco and painted with murals, most of which are almost completely gone. In the upper part, the entrance is symbolized by the open jaws of a serpent, complete with fangs, eyes and a forked tongue, which was painted red. This upper portion is covered by a thatched roof of the grass the area is named for.\n\nJust inside of the entrance, on the east side, there is a sculpture of a serpent’s head on which rests the remains of a statue of an Eagle Warrior. To the west, there is another sculpture in the shape of a large pedestal, symbolizing a tlapanhuéhuetl (war drum). Above this is a sculpture of a cipactli, which is a primeval being, occasionally called a “monster of the earth.” The cipactli is holding up a person, of which only the sandals remain. It is thought the two statues functioned as standards. Further inside is a bench that surrounds a space similar to a hemicycle. The horseshoe bench has four sculptures, the most outstanding one being an eagle that faces the entrance. Two others are also of eagles while the fourth is a jaguar. The jaguar statue has its skin spread out as if it were a mounted trophy. Behind the eagles there is a cuauhxicalli or sacred vessel in which to put the hearts of sacrifice victims, who then turn into messengers of the sun. The orientation of the building relates to the movement of the stars. Before it was covered with a thatched roof to preserve it, openings in the walls provoked light phenomena at certain times such as at the summer solstice.\n\nFrom here was found a large wooden huéhuetl or ceremonial war drum, which is now in the Museum of Anthropology and History in the Mexiquense Cultural Center in Toluca. At the spring and fall equinoxes some 5,000 to 7,000 people visit the site. The conical thatched roof that covers the main building is a reproduction of the kind of roof it probably had in antiquity, but the shed-like porch is less faithful to the original. Despite acts of vandalism, the interior of this building is still in good condition.\n\n\n"}

Knowledge of her place in Wyatt's life was concealed by Josephine Earp, his later common-law wife, who worked hard to protect her and Wyatt's reputation in their later years.\n\nMattie was born Celia Ann Blaylock in Monroe Township, Johnson County, Iowa, near Fairfax, Iowa, to Henry Blaylock and Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Vance. She was their third child and second daughter. The family lived on a small farm that Henry had obtained in 1846. Henry and his wife were stern parents and adhered to the principle, \"spare the rod and spoil the child,\" and \"children should be seen and not heard.\"\n\nCelia, or \"Celie\" as she was known as a child, attended Sunday school, learned Biblical parables, and was taught to live by the Ten Commandments. When her older sister Martha Jane was 17 she married Charles Probst on July 1, 1870. Celia had no desire to live on a farm the rest of her life.\n\nIn mid-1868, Celia ran away with her younger sister Sarah to avoid farm life. Celia was a reasonably skilled seamstress and may have sought work in that field, but both girls found life on their own very difficult. There were few employment possibilities for young girls. They likely headed west to one of the growing towns along the Kansas-Iowa-Missouri border area. Sarah returned home less than a year later, chagrined and shamed by her experience. Her parents greeted her cheerlessly and took her back in disgrace.\n\nAt some point after leaving home, Celia chose the alias \"Mattie\", probably in an effort to conceal her identity and remain as anonymous as possible. However, court records indicate that she continued to call herself by her childhood nickname of \"Celie\", which was often phonetically spelled by court clerks as \"Sally\"; no court records have been found throughout her life using the name \"Mattie\". The first known record of Mattie's presence is a picture taken in Fort Scott in 1871. It's not known where she and Sarah spent the intervening time. Court records show that she adopted prostitution as her profession beginning in 1872 in Fort Scott, then later in Dodge City.\n\nMattie Blaylock may have met Wyatt between 1871 and 1873. She continued to work as a prostitute during their early years together. In the 1880 United States Census Blaylock is listed as Wyatt's wife though there is no record of a legal marriage.\n\nBlaylock was said to have suffered from headaches, and while in Tombstone, Arizona, she became addicted to laudanum, a common opiate and pain killer. It is not known exactly when Earp and Blaylock ended their relationship. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Earp and his next common-law wife, Josephine \"Sadie\" Marcus, together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. Frank Waters wrote in \"The Earp Brothers of Tombstone\" of public fights between Sadie Marcus and Blaylock and how the affair was a public scandal. However, Waters' book has been criticized as biased for its negative portrayal of Wyatt Earp and for including details not mentioned in the original manuscript by Allie Earp (the common-law wife of Wyatt Earp's brother Virgil).\n\nAfter the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and the March 18, 1882, assassination of Morgan Earp, Wyatt Earp, his youngest brother Warren, and a posse of other deputies began a vendetta. They hunted down some of the outlaw Cowboys they believed responsible for maiming Virgil Earp and killing Morgan. In early April, Wyatt left Arizona for New Mexico and then Colorado.\n\nBlaylock left Tombstone with other Earp family members for Colton, California. She apparently expected to receive a telegram from Earp telling her where to meet him, but it never arrived. Instead, Earp went to San Francisco in late 1882 and began a relationship with Josephine \"Sadie\" Marcus, who had been the common-law wife of Johnny Behan in Tombstone. Blaylock left Colton for Pinal City, Arizona Territory, a town that Blaylock and Earp had stopped in for two months in 1879 on their way to Tombstone. When the couple had been there three years earlier, it was a booming silver town. Upon Mattie's return, however, the silver boom had died down and the bulk of the town's population had moved on. Blaylock had planned a return to prostitution in Pinal City, but with most of the prospective clientele gone with the silver, making a living there proved difficult.\n\nOn July 3, 1888, Blaylock took a lethal dose of laudanum and alcohol. Her death was ruled as \"suicide by opium poisoning\". A long time abuser of laudanum and alcohol, it is possible she overdosed by accident and died of respiratory depression. The coroner's report of her death is brief. She is buried in the cemetery at Pinal City, now a ghost town, and located just west of the former cement and mining town of Superior, Arizona.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3538425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3538425", "title": "Media blackout", "text": "Media blackout\n\nMedia blackout refers to the censorship of news related to a certain topic, particularly in mass media, for any reason. A media blackout may be voluntary, or may in some countries be enforced by the government or state. The latter case is controversial in peacetime, as some regard it as a human rights violation and repression of free speech. Press blackout is a similar phrase, but refers specifically to printed media.\n\nMedia blackouts are used, in particular, in times of declared war, to keep useful intelligence from the enemy. In some cases formal censorship is used, in others the news media are usually keen to support their country voluntarily as in the UK D- (later DA-)Notice system in the Second World War.\n\nSome examples of media blackout would include the media bans of southern Japan during the droppings of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the lack of independent media correspondence from Iraq during the Persian Gulf War.\n\nDuring World War II, the US Office of Censorship sent messages to newspapers and radio stations, which were acted on by recipients, asking them not to report any sightings or explosions of fire balloons, so the Japanese would have no information on the balloons' effectiveness when planning future actions. As a result, the Japanese learned the fate of only one of their bombs, which landed in Wyoming, but failed to explode. The Japanese stopped all launches after less than six months. The press blackout in the U.S. was lifted after the first deaths from fire balloons, to ensure that the public was warned, though public knowledge of the threat could have possibly prevented the deaths. News of the loss of over 4,000 lives when UK ship RMS \"Lancastria\" was sunk during the war was voluntarily suppressed to prevent it affecting civilian morale, but was published after it became known overseas.\n\nSome media critics have questioned whether the 2000 Wichita Massacre received little to no coverage in the mainstream media due to political correctness regarding the race of the perpetrators and the victims. Such critics also cite the 2007 Murders of Channon Christian and Christopher Newsom in Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\nA media blackout was used during the 2005 New York City transit strike to allow for more effective contract negotiation between the two sides of the dispute. Most typically, the more freedom of the press that any particular country has, and the more sensational the story, the more likely it is that at least one news organization will ignore the \"blackout\" and run the story.\n\nThe 2008 abduction of Canadian journalist Mellissa Fung was given a media blackout to assure her safe return. All media sources obliged making the Canadian public unaware of the fate of Fung.\n\nIn 2008, the fact that Prince Harry, then third in line to the British throne, was serving on active duty in Afghanistan was subject to a blackout in the British media for his own safety. He was brought home early after the blackout was broken by foreign media.\n\nOn 22 June 2009, when news came that \"New York Times\" reporter David Rohde had escaped from his Taliban captors, few knew he had even been kidnapped, because for the seven months he and two Afghan colleagues were in the Taliban's hands, The Times kept that information under wraps. Out of concern for the reporter's safety, \"The Times\" asked other major news organizations to do the same; NPR was among dozens of news outlets that did not report on the kidnapping at the urging of Rohde's colleagues. Kelly McBride, who teaches ethics to journalists at the Poynter Institute, says she was \"really astounded\" by the media blackout. \"I find it a little disturbing, because it makes me wonder what else 40 international news organizations have agreed not to tell the public,\" she tells NPR's Melissa Block. McBride says the blackout could hurt the credibility of news organizations. \"I don't think we do ourselves any favors long term for our credibility when we have a total news blackout on something that's clearly of interest to the public,\" she says.\n\nIn 2009, on the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, a number of social media websites were made inaccessible and foreign television reception disrupted in China.\n\nOn 18 January 2012, Wikipedia participated in a voluntary media blackout to protest SOPA.\n\nSome blackouts, or media dereliction, may arise due to social factors rather than mandates, such as the Kermit Gosnell abortion trial having been avoided by all media. Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn and 71 other Members of Congress condemned the blackout. It was also termed a blackout by Troy Newman, president of the Kansas-based pro-life Operation Rescue.\n\n\"Writing for The Washington Post, Melinda Henneberger responded that \"we didn’t write more because the only abortion story most outlets ever cover in the news pages is every single threat or perceived threat to abortion rights. In fact, that is so fixed a view of what constitutes coverage of that issue that it’s genuinely hard, I think, for many journalists to see a story outside that paradigm as news. That’s not so much a conscious decision as a reflex, but the effect is one-sided coverage\". Explaining why some of her colleagues did not report on the story, Henneberger wrote, \"One colleague viewed Gosnell’s alleged atrocities as a local crime story, though I can’t think of another mass murder, with hundreds of victims, that we ever saw that way. Another said it was just too lurid, though that didn’t keep us from covering Jeffrey Dahmer, or that aspiring cannibal at the NYPD.\"[140] Writing for Bloomberg View, Jeffrey Goldberg said that this story \"upsets a particular narrative about the reality of certain types of abortion, and that reality isn’t something some pro-choice absolutists want to discuss\".\"\n\nIn late 2015 to mid 2016, the supporters and campaign of Democratic Party (United States) candidate Bernie Sanders accused Sanders was being subject to a mass media blackout, citing that Sanders had received only 20 seconds of media coverage by ABC Television Network's \"World News Tonight\" in contrast to 81 minutes of Donald Trump media coverage.\n\nIn 2016 many speculate that the UK government blacked-out the media relating to the Nuit debout due to the upcoming UK Referendum vote on the EU Membership.\n\nOn 24 January 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump instituted a media blackout at the Environmental Protection Agency and barred staff from awarding any new contracts or grants, the same day he signed an order to move controversial Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines forward.\n\nIn association football, a press or media blackout is also referred to as a \"silenzio stampa\" (literally \"press silence\") from the corresponding Italian phrase. It specifically refers to when a football club or national team and the players refuse to give interviews or in any other way cooperate with the press, often during important tournaments, or when the club feels that the media does not depict the club and their activities in an objective way. The phrase \"silenzio stampa\" was born during the 1982 FIFA World Cup, when the Italian team created a news blackout due to rumors and untrue stories circulating in the press.\n\n"}

After the secession of Belgium in 1830, Orangist sentiment in Flanders and Wallonia for a time sought a restoration of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. It was a movement directed by William I of the Netherlands as part of his \"Volhardingspolitiek\" and containing most of the Belgian elites (nobility, industrials). Some of the most prominent Flemish Orangists were Jan Frans Willems and Hippolyte Metdepenningen. Although refusing to participate in parliamentary elections as they deemed Belgian national institutions as illegitimate, the Orangists did take part in local elections (province and municipal) from which they activated against the new Belgian state through political actions and an activist press. At least three Orangist coups were foiled during the 1830s. Although losing Dutch financial and political support after the Treaty of London (1839) and William I's abdication (1840), the weakening Belgian Orangism survived well into the 1850s, strongly opposing the Belgian Revolution and rallying against independence.\n\nIt was one inspiration for the later Greater Netherlands movement, although that movement was not all monarchist.\n\n\n\n"}

A related stylistic device is antanaclasis, in which the same word is repeated, but each time with a different sense. Another related term is figura etymologica.\n\nIn inflected languages polyptoton is the same word being repeated but appearing each time in a different case. (for example, \"Iuppiter\", \"Iovis\", \"Iovi\", \"Iovem\", \"Iove\" [in Latin being the nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative forms of \"Iuppiter\" (the god Jupiter), respectively]).\n\nThe form is relatively common in Latin Christian poetry and prose in a construction called the superlative genitive, in phrases such as sanctum sanctorum (\"holy of holies\"), and found its way into languages such as Old English, which naturally preferred the prevalent alliteration that is part and parcel of polyptoton—in fact, polyptoton is \"much more prevalent in Old English verse than in Latin verse.\" The specific superlative genitive in Old English, however, occurs only in Latinate Christian poems, not in secular poetry.\n\nIt is also used in public speaking, and several examples can be found in Churchill's speeches. \n\nG. K. Chesterton frequently employed this device to create paradox: \nIn combination with verbal active and passive voices, it points out the idea of a latent reciprocity:\n\nAn alternative way to use the device is to develop polyptoton over the course of an entire novel, which is done in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Shelley combines polyptoton with periphrastic naming, which is the technique of referring to someone using several indirect names. The creature in Frankenstein is referred to by many terms, such as \"fiend\", \"devil\", \"being\", and \"ogre\". However, the first term that Shelley uses in reference to the creature is \"wretch\". Throughout the novel, various forms of this are used, such as \"wretchedly\" and \"wretchedness\", which may be seen as polyptoton. According to Duyfhuizen, the gradual development of polyptoton in \"Frankenstein\" is significant because it symbolizes the intricacies of one's own identity.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57136049", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57136049", "title": "Postvaccinal encephalitis", "text": "Postvaccinal encephalitis\n\nPostvaccinal encephalitis (PVE) is postvaccinal complication which was associated with vaccination with vaccinia virus during worldwide smallpox eradication campaign. With mortality ranging between 25 – 30% and lifelong consequences between 16 – 30% it was one of the most severe adverse events associated with this vaccination. The mechanism of its underlying condition is unknown.\n\nPVE symptoms start to appear between 8th and 14th day after vaccination. Amongst the first are fever, headache, confusion and nausea. With passing time lethargy, seizures, short and long term memory dysfunctions, localized paralysis, hemiplegia, polyneuritis and convulsions. In extreme cases PVE can lead to coma and death.\n\nVaccinia immunoglobulin was given to patients with PVE. But some significant effects of this treatment were observed only if given before PVE developed. That is why only supportive treatment was given to patients with PVE to attenuate symptoms. Source\n\nInflammatory extra-adventitial lesions are found not only in brain but in spinal cord as well. Lesions might be uniform in acute phase or disseminated in subacute phase. Unlike in cases of encephalitis lethargica the main damage is found in white brain matter. Meninges are infiltrated with T cells, plasmatic cells and phagocytic cells. Polymorfonuclear cells were found only in severe lesions. Apart from cellular infiltrate in perivascular space there is a tissue rarefication in spaces close to damaged blood vessels. Accumulated small nuclei are found in places of such rarefication. Strong demyelination with rapid clearance of degraded myelin is also observed in cases of PVE. Tissue damage leads to necrosis in the end.\n\nVaccination with vaccinia virus was accompanied with a spectrum of adverse events. Some of them lethal. Generally accepted number of deaths after vaccination with live vaccine is one per one million vaccinations. But during the eradication campaign more than one vaccination strain was used and these strains differed significantly in causing adverse events.\n\nThe incidence of PVE was between 44.9 cases per one million vaccinations with Bern strain used in western Europe to 2.9 cases per one million vaccinations with NYCBH strain used in the US. Number of deaths directly connected to PVE also differed from strain to strain. With 11 deaths per one million vaccinations with the Bern strain to 1.2 deaths per one million vaccinations with the NYCBH strain. PVE incidence also depended on the age of the vaccinated person. That is why in the US children up to one year of age and in Europe children up to three years of age were excluded from vaccination.\n\nComplications with the central neural system after smallpox vaccination were observed for the first time right after the vaccination begun. The first diagnosed case of PVE was in 1905.\n\nIn times of the smallpox eradication campaign, when PVE was a serious problem, there were no tools for identification of immune mechanism behind PVE available. Considering the fact that modern smallpox vaccines are much safer and only chosen personnel are vaccinated, PVE is no longer in the centre of attention. Nevertheless, for its similarity with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), which is also postvaccinal adverse reaction (observed for example after anti hepatitis A or B virus vaccination), PVE is considered to be of autoimmune nature. There is no final proof of PVE being caused directly by vaccine virus replication in neural tissues.\n"}
{"id": "43507260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43507260", "title": "Quantifier (logic)", "text": "Quantifier (logic)\n\nIn logic, quantification specifies the quantity of specimens in the domain of discourse that satisfy an open formula. The two most common quantifiers mean \"for all\" and \"there exists\". For example, in arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever, by writing that \"for all\" n (where n is a natural number), there is another number (say, the successor of n) which is one bigger than n.\n\nA language element which generates a quantification (such as \"every\") is called a quantifier. \nThe resulting expression is a quantified expression, it is said to be quantified over the predicate (such as \"the natural number \"x\" has a successor\") whose free variable is bound by the quantifier. \nIn formal languages, quantification is a formula constructor that produces new formulas from old ones. \nThe semantics of the language specifies how the constructor is interpreted.\nTwo fundamental kinds of quantification in predicate logic are universal quantification and existential quantification. \nThe traditional symbol for the universal quantifier \"all\" is \"∀\", a rotated letter \"A\", and for the existential quantifier \"exists\" is \"∃\", a rotated letter \"E\". These quantifiers have been generalized beginning with the work of Mostowski and Lindström.\n\nQuantification is used as well in natural languages; examples of quantifiers in English are \"for all\", \"for some\", \"many\", \"few\", \"a lot\", and \"no;\" see Quantifier (linguistics) for details.\n\nConsider the following statement:\nThis has the appearance of an \"infinite conjunction\" of propositions. From the point of view of formal languages this is immediately a problem, since syntax rules are expected to generate finite objects. The example above is fortunate in that there is a procedure to generate all the conjuncts. However, if an assertion were to be made about every irrational number, there would be no way to enumerate all the conjuncts, since irrationals cannot be enumerated. A succinct formulation which avoids these problems uses \"universal quantification\":\nA similar analysis applies to the disjunction,\nwhich can be rephrased using \"existential quantification\":\n\nIt is possible to devise abstract algebras whose models include formal languages with quantification, but progress has been slow and interest in such algebra has been limited. Three approaches have been devised to date:\n\nThe two most common quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. The traditional symbol for the universal quantifier is \"∀\", a rotated letter \"A\", which stands for \"for all\" or \"all\". The corresponding symbol for the existential quantifier is \"∃\", a rotated letter \"E\", which stands for \"there exists\" or \"exists\".\n\nAn example of translating a quantified English statement would be as follows. Given the statement, \"Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach,\" we can identify key aspects and rewrite using symbols including quantifiers. So, let \"X\" be the set of all Peter's friends, \"P\"(\"x\") the predicate \"\"x\" likes to dance\", and \"Q\"(\"x\") the predicate \"\"x\" likes to go to the beach\". Then the above sentence can be written in formal notation as formula_1, which is read, \"for every \"x\" that is a member of \"X\", \"P\" applies to \"x\" or \"Q\" applies to \"x\".\"\n\nSome other quantified expressions are constructed as follows, \nfor a formula \"P\". These two expressions (using the definitions above) are read as \"there exists a friend of Peter who likes to dance\" and \"all friends of Peter like to dance\" respectively.\nVariant notations include, for set \"X\" and set members \"x\":\nAll of these variations also apply to universal quantification.\nOther variations for the universal quantifier are\n\nSome versions of the notation explicitly mention the range of quantification. The range of quantification must always be specified; for a given mathematical theory, this can be done in several ways:\n\nOne can use any variable as a quantified variable in place of any other, under certain restrictions in which \"variable capture\" does not occur. Even if the notation uses typed variables, variables of that type may be used.\n\nInformally or in natural language, the \"∀\"x\"\" or \"∃\"x\"\" might appear after or in the middle of \"P\"(\"x\"). Formally, however, the phrase that introduces the dummy variable is placed in front.\n\nMathematical formulas mix symbolic expressions for quantifiers, with natural language quantifiers such as\nKeywords for uniqueness quantification include:\nFurther, \"x\" may be replaced by a pronoun. For example, \n\nThe order of quantifiers is critical to meaning, as is illustrated by the following two propositions:\nThis is clearly true; it just asserts that every natural number has a square. The meaning of the assertion in which the quantifiers are turned around is different:\nThis is clearly false; it asserts that there is a single natural number \"s\" that is at the same time the square of \"every\" natural number. This is because the syntax directs that any variable cannot be a function of subsequently introduced variables.\n\nA less trivial example from mathematical analysis are the concepts of uniform and pointwise continuity, whose definitions differ only by an exchange in the positions of two quantifiers.\nA function \"f\" from R to R is called\nIn the former case, the particular value chosen for \"δ\" can be a function of both \"ε\" and \"x\", the variables that precede it.\nIn the latter case, \"δ\" can be a function only of \"ε\", i.e. it has to be chosen independent of \"x\".\nFor example, \"f\"(\"x\") = \"x\" satisfies pointwise, but not uniform continuity.\nIn contrast, interchanging the two initial universal quantifiers in the definition of pointwise continuity does not change the meaning.\n\nThe maximum depth of nesting of quantifiers inside a formula is called its quantifier rank.\n\nIf \"D\" is a domain of \"x\" and \"P\"(\"x\") is a predicate dependent on \"x\", then the universal proposition can be expressed as\n\nThis notation is known as restricted or relativized or bounded quantification. Equivalently,\n\nThe existential proposition can be expressed with bounded quantification as\n\nor equivalently\n\nTogether with negation, only one of either the universal or existential quantifier is needed to perform both tasks:\n\nwhich shows that to disprove a \"for all \"x\"\" proposition, one needs no more than to find an \"x\" for which the predicate is false. Similarly,\n\nto disprove a \"there exists an \"x\" proposition, one needs to show that the predicate is false for all \"x\".\n\nEvery quantification involves one specific variable and a \"domain of discourse\" or \"range of quantification\" of that variable. The range of quantification specifies the set of values that the variable takes. In the examples above, the range of quantification is the set of natural numbers. Specification of the range of quantification allows us to express the difference between, asserting that a predicate holds for some natural number or for some real number. Expository conventions often reserve some variable names such as \"n\" for natural numbers and \"x\"\" for real numbers, although relying exclusively on naming conventions cannot work in general since ranges of variables can change in the course of a mathematical argument.\n\nA more natural way to restrict the domain of discourse uses \"guarded quantification\". For example, the guarded quantification \nmeans\n\nIn some mathematical theories a single domain of\ndiscourse fixed in advance is assumed. For example, in Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, variables range over all sets. In this case, guarded quantifiers can be used to mimic a smaller range of quantification. Thus in the example\nabove to express\nin Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, it can be said\nwhere N is the set of all natural numbers.\n\nMathematical Semantics is the application of mathematics to study the meaning of expressions in a formal language. It has three elements: A mathematical specification of a class of objects via syntax, a mathematical specification of various semantic domains and the relation between the two, which is usually expressed as a function from syntactic objects to semantic ones. This article only addresses the issue of how quantifier elements are interpreted.\n\nGiven a model theoretical logical framework, the syntax of a formula can be given by a syntax tree. Quantifiers have scope and a variable \"x\" is free if it is not within the scope of a quantification for that variable. Thus in\nthe occurrence of both \"x\" and \"y\" in \"C\"(\"y\",\"x\") is free.\nAn interpretation for first-order predicate calculus assumes as given\na domain of individuals \"X\". A formula \"A\" whose free variables\nare \"x\", ..., \"x\" is interpreted as a\nboolean-valued function \"F\"(\"v\", ...,\n\"v\") of \"n\" arguments, where each argument ranges\nover the domain \"X\". Boolean-valued means that the function assumes one of the values T (interpreted as truth) or F (interpreted as falsehood). The interpretation of the formula\nis the function \"G\" of \"n\"-1 arguments such that \"G\"(\"v\", ...,\"v\") = T if and only if \"F\"(\"v\", ..., \"v\", \"w\") = T for every \"w\" in \"X\". If \"F\"(\"v\", ..., \"v\", \"w\") = F for at least one value of \"w\", then \"G\"(\"v\", ...,\"v\") = F. Similarly the interpretation of the formula\nis the function \"H\" of \"n\"-1 arguments such that \"H\"(\"v\", ...,\"v\") = T if and only if \"F\"(\"v\", ...,\"v\", \"w\") = T for at least one \"w\" and \"H\"(\"v\", ..., \"v\") = F otherwise.\n\nThe semantics for uniqueness quantification requires first-order predicate calculus with equality. This means there is given a distinguished two-placed predicate \"=\"; the semantics is also modified accordingly so that \"=\" is always interpreted as the two-place equality relation on \"X\". The interpretation of \nthen is the function of \"n\"-1 arguments, which is the logical \"and\" of the interpretations of \n\nNone of the quantifiers previously discussed apply to a quantification such as\n\nOne possible interpretation mechanism can be obtained as follows: Suppose that in addition to a semantic domain \"X\", we have given a probability measure P defined on \"X\" and cutoff numbers 0 < \"a\" ≤ \"b\" ≤ 1. If \"A\" is a formula with free variables \"x\"...,\"x\" whose interpretation is\nthe function \"F\" of variables \"v\"...,\"v\"\nthen the interpretation of \nis the function of \"v\"...,\"v\" which is T if and only if\nand F otherwise. Similarly, the interpretation of \nis the function of \"v\"...,\"v\" which is F if and only if\nand T otherwise.\nA few other quantifiers have been proposed over time. In particular, the solution quantifier, noted § (section sign) and read \"those\". For example:\nis read \"those \"n\" in N such that \"n\" ≤ 4 are in {0,1,2}.\" The same construct is expressible in set-builder notation:\n\nSome other quantifiers sometimes used in mathematics include:\n\nTerm logic, also called Aristotelian logic, treats quantification in a manner that is closer to natural language, and also less suited to formal analysis. Term logic treated \"All\", \"Some\" and \"No\" in the 4th century BC, in an account also touching on the alethic modalities.\n\nIn 1827, George Bentham published his \"Outline of a new system of logic, with a critical examination of Dr Whately's Elements of Logic\", describing the principle of the quantifier, but the book was not widely circulated.\nWilliam Hamilton claimed to have coined the terms \"quantify\" and \"quantification\", most likely in his Edinburgh lectures c. 1840. Augustus De Morgan confirmed this in 1847, but modern usage began with De Morgan in 1862 where he makes statements such as \"We are to take in both \"all\" and \"some-not-all\" as quantifiers\".\n\nGottlob Frege, in his 1879 \"Begriffsschrift\", was the first to employ a quantifier to bind a variable ranging over a domain of discourse and appearing in predicates. He would universally quantify a variable (or relation) by writing the variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line appearing in his diagrammatic formulas. Frege did not devise an explicit notation for existential quantification, instead employing his equivalent of ~∀\"x\"~, or contraposition. Frege's treatment of quantification went largely unremarked until Bertrand Russell's 1903 \"Principles of Mathematics\".\n\nIn work that culminated in Peirce (1885), Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell independently invented universal and existential quantifiers, and bound variables. Peirce and Mitchell wrote Π and Σ where we now write ∀\"x\" and ∃\"x\". Peirce's notation can be found in the writings of Ernst Schröder, Leopold Loewenheim, Thoralf Skolem, and Polish logicians into the 1950s. Most notably, it is the notation of Kurt Gödel's landmark 1930 paper on the completeness of first-order logic, and 1931 paper on the incompleteness of Peano arithmetic.\n\nPeirce's approach to quantification also influenced William Ernest Johnson and Giuseppe Peano, who invented yet another notation, namely (\"x\") for the universal quantification of \"x\" and (in 1897) ∃\"x\" for the existential quantification of \"x\". Hence for decades, the canonical notation in philosophy and mathematical logic was (\"x\")\"P\" to express \"all individuals in the domain of discourse have the property \"P\",\" and \"(∃\"x\")\"P\"\" for \"there exists at least one individual in the domain of discourse having the property \"P\".\" Peano, who was much better known than Peirce, in effect diffused the latter's thinking throughout Europe. Peano's notation was adopted by the \"Principia Mathematica\" of Whitehead and Russell, Quine, and Alonzo Church. In 1935, Gentzen introduced the ∀ symbol, by analogy with Peano's ∃ symbol. ∀ did not become canonical until the 1960s.\n\nAround 1895, Peirce began developing his existential graphs, whose variables can be seen as tacitly quantified. Whether the shallowest instance of a variable is even or odd determines whether that variable's quantification is universal or existential. (Shallowness is the contrary of depth, which is determined by the nesting of negations.) Peirce's graphical logic has attracted some attention in recent years by those researching heterogeneous reasoning and diagrammatic inference.\n\n\n\n"}

Sprague de Camp, about an apparently immortal Neanderthal Man surviving into the present day.\n\nThe story was first published in the magazine \"Unknown\" for June, 1939 and first appeared in book form in de Camp's collection \"The Wheels of If and Other Science Fiction\" (Shasta, 1948). It later appeared in the subsequent de Camp collections \"The Best of L. Sprague de Camp\" (Doubleday, 1978), \"Aristotle and the Gun and Other Stories\" (Five Star, 2002), and \"\" (NESFA Press, 2005).\n\nThe story has also appeared in the magazines \"Fantastic Story Magazine\" for July, 1953 and \"Jim Baen's Universe\" for April, 2007, and the anthologies \"Human?\" (Lion Books, 1954), \"The Unknown\" (Pyramid Books, 1963), \"The Freak Show\" (Rapp & Whiting, 1970), \"The Great Science Fiction Stories Volume 1, 1939\" (DAW Books, 1979), \"Dawn of Time\" (Elsevier/Nelson Books, 1979), \"\" (Bonanza Books, 1983), \"Neanderthals\" (Signet/NEL, 1987), \"\" (Galahad Books, 1988), \"Modern Classics of Fantasy\" (St. Martin's Press, 1997), and \"My Favorite Fantasy Story\" (DAW Books, 2000). The story has been translated into Dutch, French, German and Italian.\n\nVisiting a freak show, scientist Dr. Matilda Sandler takes an interest in the ape-man \"Ungo-Bungo\", who appears to exhibit genuine atavistic features. After the show she goes backstage and meets the man behind the role to ask if he will agree to be examined for scientific purposes. Ungo-Bungo, who calls himself Clarence Aloysius Gaffney, proves affable but reticent about his past and reluctant to submit to examination. In time, however, he warily consents in return for surgery to correct some old injuries.\n\nEventually it comes out that Gaffney is actually Shining Hawk, a Neanderthal Man over 50,000 years old, whose aging process was frozen early in life when he was struck by lightning. He had survived by his wits on the periphery of human society since the extinction of his own kind, using a succession of false identities and getting by as a blacksmith or in menial professions like his present one. He has been a witness to much of history from the margins, making little personal impact on it—though it is suggested that he may have been the original basis for the tales of the divine lame blacksmith Vulcan (his leg injury is very old).\n\nAs it happens, however, Gaffney's caution proves well-founded; not only does Sandler develop an unwelcome crush on him, but the revelation of his secret brings out the worst in some of the scientists to whom it is confided. Discovering that the surgeon who is to perform his operation secretly intends to dissect him, Gaffney skips out. Later, from an undisclosed location, he sends his apologies and regrets to those who have befriended and aided him.\n\nAccording to Sam Moskowitz, the story \"broke ground for an entirely new approach on the treatment of such material,\" which was \"most notably emulated by Philip José Farmer in 'The Alley Man'.\"\n\nDon D'Ammassa wrote \"[t]he forthrightly sentimental \"The Gnarly Man\" is one of the most moving portraits ever to appear in the [science fiction] field.\"\n\nMore recently, Robert Wilfred Franson called the work \"a good specimen of the distinct category of stories about Neanderthal Man in science fiction (or fantasy if you prefer).\" He notes it \"is a humorous story, but it may make you think even while you're enjoying it,\" and observes that \"[d]e Camp obviously has fun here thinking through the likely practical concerns of someone living so long.\" He rates \"[t]he character of Clarence [as] very well sketched in the space of a novelet,\" going on to say \"[h]e brings to my mind a comparison with the title character, a speaking gorilla, in Daniel Quinn's novel \"Ishmael\". The advantage is all Clarence's, as he is a man; whereas poor Ishmael is an ideological mouthpiece.\"\n\nDe Camp wrote that he got the subject for the story from his friend P. Schuyler Miller, who was also writing a story about a Neanderthal man in modern times. The Miller piece, \"Old Man Mulligan,\" appeared in the December, 1940 issue of \"Astounding Science-Fiction\". De Camp noted that the two stories were completely different, and used the incident to illustrate the principle that two science fiction writers, using the same idea, will write different stories, so there is nothing wrong with copying someone else's idea.\n\nDe Camp also featured Neanderthals in his later fantasy novel \"The Pixilated Peeress\" (1991). In the parallel world of that novel the species forms a relict population pushed by humanity into the higher elevations of the Alps. The fugitive hero Thorolf Zigramson takes refuge among a tribe of these \"trolls,\" as they are known, and is adopted into their society and aided by them.\n\n\"The Gnarly Man\" is one of de Camp's most notable works. The story's popularity has been demonstrated by frequent reprinting and anthologization.\n"}

According to him, \"The Hobbit\" was not originally a part of the Middle-earth universe and was attached to his father's earlier, far darker legendarium only superficially, although the existence of \"The Hobbit\" forever altered the legendarium.\n\nAs Christopher Tolkien was not going to embark on a published study of \"The Hobbit\", the task was given to Taum Santoski in the 1980s. Santoski had connections to the Marquette collection of Tolkien material, which is where the original manuscripts reside. He died in 1991, and ultimately the task passed to John Rateliff. Although Christopher Tolkien did not work directly on \"The History of The Hobbit\", the work is in a very similar vein to the \"literary archaeology\" of his \"History of Middle-earth\".\n\nRateliff submitted a finished draft of the book to Christopher Tolkien, who, approving of the work, gave \"The History of The Hobbit\" his personal blessing to be published in association with his father’s other works.\n\n\n"}

The opposite of verbosity is plain language.\nSome teachers, including the author of \"The Elements of Style\", warn writers not to be verbose. Similarly, some authors, including Mark Twain and Ernest Hemingway, are known for their avoidance of verbosity. \n\nSynonyms for verbosity include wordiness, verbiage, prolixity, grandiloquence, garrulousness, expatiation, logorrhea, and sesquipedalianism. \n\nExamples of verbosity are common in political speech, academic prose, and other genres.\n\nThe word \"verbosity\" comes from Latin \"verbosus\", \"wordy\". There are many other English words that also refer to the use of excessive words.\n\n\"Prolixity\" comes from Latin \"prolixus\", \"extended\". \"Prolixity\" can also be used to refer to the length of a monologue or speech, especially a formal address such as a lawyer's oral argument.\n\n\"Grandiloquence\" is complex speech or writing judged to be pompous or bombastic diction. It is a combination of the Latin words \"grandis\" (\"great\") and \"loqui\" (\"to speak\").\n\n\"Logorrhea\" or \"logorrhoea\" (from Greek λογόρροια, \"logorrhoia\", \"word-flux\") is an excessive flow of words. It is often used pejoratively to describe prose that is hard to understand because it is needlessly complicated or uses excessive jargon. The term is also sometimes applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general.\n\n\"Sesquipedalianism\" is a linguistic style that involves the use of long words. Roman poet Horace coined the phrase \"sesquipedalia verba\" in his Ars Poetica. It is a compound of \"sesqui\", \"one and a half\", and \"pes\", \"foot\", a reference to meter. The earliest recorded usage in English of \"sesquipedalian\" is in 1656, and of \"sesquipedalianism\", 1863.\n\n\"Garrulous\" comes from Latin \"garrulus\", \"talkative\", a form of the verb \"garrīre\", \"to chatter\". The adjective may describe a person who is excessively talkative, especially about trivial matters, or a speech that is excessively wordy or diffuse\n\nThe noun \"expatiation\" and the verb \"expatiate\" come from Latin \"expatiātus\", past participle from \"spatiārī\", \"to wander\". They refer to enlarging a discourse, text, or description.\n\nThe word \"logorrhea\" is often used pejoratively to describe highly abstract prose that contains little concrete language. Since abstract writing is hard to visualize, it often seems confusing or excessive. Works in academic fields that involve many abstract ideas, such as philosophy, often fail to include extensive concrete examples of their ideas.\nIn an attempt to prove that \"logorrhea\" accompanies a lack of academic rigor, physics professor Alan Sokal wrote a nonsensical essay, and had it published in a respected journal (\"Social Text\") as a practical joke. The journal defended the article as genuine even after Sokal denounced his own article publicly. The episode has come to be known as the Sokal Affair.\n\nThe term is sometimes also applied to unnecessarily wordy speech in general; this is more usually referred to as \"prolixity\". Some people defend the use of additional words as idiomatic, a matter of artistic preference, or helpful in explaining complex ideas or messages.\n\nWarren G. Harding, the 29th President of the United States, was notably verbose even in his era. A Democratic leader, William Gibbs McAdoo, described Harding's speeches as \"an army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea.\"\n\nSenator Robert C. Byrd (Democrat, of West Virginia) lost his position as Majority Leader in 1989 because his colleagues felt his speeches, which often employed obscure allusions to ancient Rome and Greece, were not an asset to the party base.\n\nThe \"Michigan Law Review\" published a 229-page parody of postmodern writing titled \"Pomobabble: Postmodern Newspeak and Constitutional 'Meaning' for the Uninitiated\". The article consists of complicated and context-sensitive self-referencing narratives. The text is peppered with number of parenthetical citations and asides, which is supposed to mock the cluttered style of postmodern writing.\n\nIn \"The King's English\", Fowler gives a passage from \"The Times\" as an example of verbosity: \"\"The Emperor\" received yesterday and to-day General Baron von Beck... It may therefore be assumed with some confidence that the terms of a feasible solution are maturing themselves in \"His Majesty's\" mind and may form the basis of further negotiations with Hungarian party leaders when \"the Monarch\" goes again to Budapest.\" Fowler objected to this passage because \"The Emperor\", \"His Majesty\", and \"the Monarch\" all refer to the same person: \"the effect\", he pointed out in \"Modern English Usage\", \"is to set readers wondering what the significance of the change is, only to conclude that there is none.\"\n\nWhile verbosity may be rhetorically useful verbose parts in communications are sometimes referred to as \"fluff\" or \"fuzz\".\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Callimachus is quoted as saying \"Big book, big evil\" (μέγα βιβλίον μέγα κακόν, \"mega biblion, mega kakon\"), rejecting the epic style of poetry in favor of his own.\n\nWilliam Strunk, an American professor of English advised in 1918 to \"Use the active voice: Put statements in positive form; Omit needless words.\"\n\nIn \"A Dictionary of Modern English Usage\" (1926) Henry Watson Fowler says, \"It is the second-rate writers, those intent rather on expressing themselves prettily than on conveying their meaning clearly, & still more those whose notions of style are based on a few misleading rules of thumb, that are chiefly open to the allurements of elegant variation,\" Fowler's term for the over-use of synonyms. Contrary to Fowler's criticism of several words being used to name the same thing in English prose, in some other languages, including French, it might be thought to be a good writing style.\n\nMark Twain (1835–1910) wrote \"generally, the fewer the words that fully communicate or evoke the intended ideas and feelings, the more effective the communication.\"\n\nErnest Hemingway (1899–1961), the 1954 Nobel laureate for literature, defended his concise style against a charge by William Faulkner that he \"had never been known to use a word that might send the reader to the dictionary.\" Hemingway responded by saying, \"Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use.\"\n\nAn inquiry into the 2005 London bombings found that verbosity can be dangerous if used by emergency services. It can lead to delay that could cost lives.\n\nA 2005 study from the psychology department of Princeton University found that using long and obscure words does not make people seem more intelligent. Dr. Daniel M. Oppenheimer did research which showed that students rated short, concise texts as being written by the most intelligent authors.

They were active professionally from the early 1940s until the late 1980s, first as a live act, then on radio, then as part of \"The Army Show\" that entertained troops in Europe during World War II, and then on both Canadian and American television.\n\nWayne (born Louis Weingarten; May 28, 1918 – July 18, 1990) and Shuster (September 5, 1916 – January 13, 2002) were well known in Canada, and were Ed Sullivan's most frequently recurring guests, appearing a record 67 times on his show. Despite repeated suggestions that they should move to the United States to further their careers, the duo chose to stay in Canada.\n\nWayne and Shuster were born in the same neighbourhood in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and met in grade school. In 1931, while students at Harbord Collegiate Institute, they performed their first skit together for their Boy Scout troop, and, as part of the school drama club, continued to entertain fellow students. They both studied at the University of Toronto, where they wrote and performed as \"Shuster and Wayne\".\n\nIn 1941, they made their radio debut on CFRB in their own show, \"The Javex Wife Preservers\", for which they were each paid $12.50 per week to dispense household hints in a humorous fashion. Their popularity on CFRB, at the time a top-rated Toronto radio station, soon landed the pair on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC)'s Trans-Canada Network as part of the Buckingham Cigarette \"Blended Rhythm Show\".\n\nThey enlisted in the Canadian Army in 1942, and were immediately assigned to \"The Canadian Army Radio Show\", which was produced in Montreal. Shuster and Wayne wrote most of the music, lyrics and skits, and were part of a cast that featured the singers Jimmie Shields and Raymonde Maranda. The radio show was a success, resulting in \"The Army Show\", a touring stage version that opened in Toronto in April 1943 to popular acclaim. \"Time Magazine\" called it \"a high-spirited, always likeable, often lavish soldier show... Two Toronto sergeants, 26-year-old Frank Shuster and 24-year-old Johnny Wayne, had authored a peppy book, some perky tunes and lyrics.\" The revue travelled across Canada in 1943 to entertain troops and help with the sale of Victory Bonds, and included a stop at the Quebec Conference. In addition to Shuster and Wayne, the cast included the singer Roger Doucet, Brian and Dennis Farnon, Denny Vaughan, and Lois Hooker (who later, as Lois Maxwell, starred as Miss Moneypenny in fourteen James Bond films). In late 1943, the revue was split up into five units and sent to England to entertain troops. Shuster and Wayne again prepared most of the material for all the units, and were assigned to a unit that followed Canadian troops into France following D-Day. The duo often performed close enough to the front lines that they had to contend with snipers, strafing and even a relatively close encounter with an exploding V-1 \"buzz bomb\".\n\nAfter demobilization, Shuster and Wayne returned to Toronto and started \"The RCA Victor Show\" on CBC Radio. An advertising executive suggested that \"Wayne & Shuster\" sounded better than \"Shuster & Wayne\". Since the order of their names wasn't important to the two, they agreed to the change. (Alex Barris later recalled that they had a CBC office with two doors — one read \"Wayne & Shuster\", the other was \"Shuster & Wayne\".) Their popularity rapidly grew and CBC changed the name of their radio programme to \"The Wayne & Shuster Show.\" By 1950, their Canadian weekly audience numbered 3 million. They also began to make a name for themselves in the U.S. when they were hired to make a radio network series to replace William Bendix's \"The Life of Riley\" while it was on summer hiatus in 1947.\n\nWayne & Shuster first appeared on television in 1950, but not in Canada, which did not have network TV until 1952. Their radio sponsor, Toni Home Permanent, also sponsored an American television show, \"Toni Twin Time\", hosted by Jack Lemmon. The sponsor asked the duo to make regular appearances on the TV program, which was not doing well. After two shows, a sponsor executive asked them to take over the hosting duties from Lemmon, who was young, inexperienced, and obviously nervous. However, they were unsure about this new medium of television, and turned down the offer.\n\nIn 1952, CBC producer Mavor Moore approached them about doing a regular live comedy show on the new CBC Television network, but after watching Milton Berle dealing with all of the details of lighting, sound, music and audience while broadcasting live from New York City, the two were even more concerned about the demands of live television. They agreed to make an appearance in one CBC television show in 1952 in Montreal, but turned down the opportunity to produce a regular show in Toronto. Wayne said, \"You guys don't know anything about television. We don't either. Why don't we wait until we both know something about it?\"\n\nTwo years later, in 1954, they finally agreed to host a regular comedy show on CBC. In 1955, on one of their shows, they presented a mock-Shakespearean sketch called \"Rinse the Blood Off My Toga\", which they also presented on British television the same year. A literate mash-up of William Shakespeare and Mickey Spillane, the sketch featured a hard-boiled Roman private eye hired by Brutus to investigate the murder of Julius Caesar on the Ides of March. As with many of their scripts, \"Rinse the Blood Off My Toga\" assumed the audience had a working knowledge of history, Shakespeare, and sometimes even Latin. In 1958, after the opening of the Stratford Festival of Canada in 1958, they created \"A Shakespearean Baseball Game\", written in iambic pentameter and rhyming couplets, and featuring lines lifted from \"Hamlet\" and \"Macbeth\". (\"O, what a rogue and bush league slob am I!... O, curséd fate, that I, who led the league, should bat .208.\") In later years, they considered this their favourite script.\n\nLorraine Thomson, who often appeared on their live broadcasts in the 1950s, called their writing \"a kind of cross between a more erudite British sense of humour and the more American vaudevillian sense of humour. They treated their audiences with respect.\"\n\nIn 1958, they signed a one-year contract with Ed Sullivan to appear regularly on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" for $7500 a show; that included a handshake agreement that Sullivan would not cut or edit their sketches, which tended to run 12 minutes or longer; their first sketch was an 14-minute re-run of the sketch they had done for CBC and British television, \"Rinse the Blood Off My Toga\". (Singer Eartha Kitt once asked Frank Shuster, \"What have you got on Ed Sullivan?\" after Sullivan cut one of her songs from a program, but left Wayne & Shuster's 12-minute sketch intact.) The only time Sullivan asked for an edit was in order to remove a joke about Southern lynchings; he was worried about offending network stations in the Southern U.S. Sullivan loved the Canadian duo and renewed their contract repeatedly; they appeared on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" a record 67 times over the next 11 years. Frank Shuster later disputed this, telling TV critic Jim Bawden that \"We were on Ed 58 times. The record books say 67, but that's wrong.\"\n\nEd Sullivan advised the two, despite their success in the U.S., to remain in Toronto. They took his advice and turned down many offers to move to the United States permanently. In later years, Shuster often told the story of one agent who tried to get them to move to Hollywood, insisting, \"You know, Frank, there's more to life than happiness.\"\n\nRegardless of their home address, in 1962, and again in 1963, they were ranked as the best comedy routine in America by Motion Picture Daily and Television Today, and co-starred in a CBS-TV sitcom, \"Holiday Lodge\", which aired as a summer replacement for [and was produced by] Jack Benny in 1961.\n\nIn 1964, Wayne & Shuster created a series of six short documentaries for CBS about comedians such as W. C. Fields and the Marx Brothers, with music scored by John Williams, titled \"Wayne & Shuster Take an Affectionate Look at...\". They made another six episodes the following year. In 1965 \"The Wayne & Shuster Hour\" won the Silver Rose at the Rose d'Or Television Festival.\n\nIn the 1960s, they moved from a weekly television show to monthly \"Wayne & Shuster\" comedy specials on CBC Television. By the 1970s, they were producing three to four comedy specials per year, which often drew Canadian television ratings of more than two million viewers.\n\nWayne and Shuster's skits often employed large casts of characters, and supporting players included Canadian actors Don Cullen, Jack Duffy, Tom Harvey, Bill Kemp, Paul Kligman, Ben Lennick, Sylvia Lennick, Peggi Loder, Les Rubie, Eric Christmas, Joe Austin, Larry Mann, Paul Soles, Marilyn Stuart, Roy Wordsworth, John Davies, Carol Robinson, Lou Pitoscia, Peggy Mahon, Don Ewer and Keith Hampshire. For many years, their music director was Canadian jazz artist Norman Amadio.\n\nWayne and Shuster were infamous for their vociferous arguments during scriptwriting sessions, television production and editing sessions. Wayne especially was particularly exacting during production and often took the studio crew to task for perceived faults. The technicians often responded by refusing to work overtime at the end of the day. During one sketch, some crew members were instructed to throw fruit and vegetables at both of the comedians from off-camera. Instead, the crew only hurled fruit at Wayne. One floor director remembered Wayne as \"two people. On the [studio] floor he was a son of a bitch, but outside he was one of the nicest guys you could meet.\" Despite their temperamental reputation in the studio, both were friendly, thoughtful and welcoming outside of work.\n\nBecause of their combative natures in the studio, the two agreed early on to not mix socially. Shortly after their CBC radio show became popular, Wayne told Shuster that he was organizing a party, but that he wasn't going to invite his partner \"because we're always together and we'll start in about the business. So, to hell with that.\" Shuster agreed, and from that point on, they led completely separate lives away from work, with different interests and hobbies.\n\nBy the late 1970s, critics were calling their comedy irrelevant and out of date, but their Canadian TV ratings remained strong. In 1980, CBC re-packaged their material into 80 half-hour specials that were syndicated worldwide.\n\nThe pair continued to produce comedy specials until Wayne's death from cancer in 1990. After Wayne's death, Shuster went back into the editing suite and from almost 40 years of their television shows, produced a retrospective series of twenty-two shows, which he also hosted. In 1999, three years before his death, he hosted a one-hour compendium of their work, \"Wayne & Shuster: The First Hundred Years\".\n\n\nIn 2000, Australian music group The Avalanches created a track called \"Frontier Psychiatrist\", which was built on various samples of previously recorded material, most noticeably the Wayne & Shuster sketch \"Frontier Psychiatrist\". (Audio clips of two other Wayne and Shuster sketches were also used in creating the track, along with samples of dozens of pieces of music.) \"Frontier Psychiatrist\" was released as a single, and became a hit in the UK, reaching No. 18 on the charts. Johnny Wayne vocalizes the song's repeated refrain \"that boy needs therapy\"; both Wayne and Frank Shuster are the featured voices throughout verses one and two.\n\n"}
