The region was once called \"El Cauce\". The tracks are fossil Late Holocene human footprints left behind in volcanic ash and mud, which solidified about 2,120±120 years ago, shortly after the group of up to 15 people passed by.\n\nIt is sometimes reported that the people were running to escape from a volcanic explosion, but the distance between the footprints indicates a walking gait. Fossilized footprints of several animals are also present, but the fact that they intersect the human footprints shows they were not traveling with the people.\n\nIn 1874, construction workers discovered the footprints. The United States medical doctor and archaeological collector, Earl Flint, brought the footprints to the attention of the international science community and media in 1884.\n\nThe Carnegie Institution of Washington began the first scientific analysis and excavations of the area in 1941 and 1942. They also constructed a museum and a building to protect the footprints.\n\nWork was continued by Joaquín Matilló, Allan L. Bryan and Jorge Espinosa in the 1960s and 1970s. Allan L. Bryan, from the University of Alberta, used radiocarbon dating to determine the age of soil humates, from a buried soil directly underlying the footprints, to 5,945±145 radiocarbon years Before Present. Based upon this date, he estimated that the footprints dated to about 5,000 Before Present. But, later dating of the volcanic deposits in which they occur, known as the Masaya Triple Layer, demonstrated that the fossil tracks are only about 2,120 ± 120 years old. In 1978, the Nicaraguan researcher Jorge Espinosa continued the excavation near the termination of the original excavation. He uncovered more footprints at a depth of 4 meters. The track is believed to continue further.\n\nSpecimens of these footprints can be viewed at both the Peabody Museum of Archaeology at Harvard University and the United States National Museum.\n\nThe \"Museo Sitio Huellas de Acahualinca\" is located at west of Managua, in the eponymous Acahualinca town. The museum was founded in 1953 by Nicaraguan scientist Leonor Martínez, later in 1989, was rescued, restored and fitted out with the support of \"ASDI\" and the Historical Museum of Sweden. In addition to footprints, the museum features a small collection of pottery and other items of archaeological interest from several sites in Nicaragua. Previously there were stone tools and a skull from León Viejo.\n\n\n"}

The term Buddhology was coined in the early 20th-century by Estlin Carpenter – a Unitarian minister, to mean the \"study of Buddhahood, the nature of the Buddha, and doctrines of a Buddha\", but the terms Buddhology and Buddhist studies are generally synonymous in the contemporary context. According to William M. Johnston, in some specific contexts, Buddhology may be viewed as a subset of Buddhist studies, with a focus on Buddhist hermeneutics, exegesis, ontology and Buddha's attributes. Scholars of Buddhist studies focus on the history, culture, archaeology, arts, philology, anthropology, sociology, theology, philosophy, practices, interreligious comparative studies and other subjects related to Buddhism.\n\nIn contrast to the study of Judaism or Christianity, the field of Buddhist studies has been dominated by \"outsiders\" to Buddhist cultures and traditions. However, Japanese universities have also made major contributions, as have Asian immigrants to Western countries, and Western converts to Buddhism.\n\nThe first graduate program in Buddhist studies in North America started in 1961 at the University of Wisconsin–Madision. According to Prebish, Buddhist studies in the United States prior to 1975 was dominated by the University of Wisconsin, Harvard University and the University of Chicago. Prebish cites two surveys by Hart in which the following university programs were found to have produced the most scholars with U.S. university posts: Chicago, Wisconsin, Harvard, Columbia, Yale, Virginia, Stanford, Berkeley, Princeton, Temple, Northwestern, Michigan, Washington, and Tokyo.\n\nOther regionally-accredited U.S. institutions with programs in Buddhism include the University of the West, Institute of Buddhist Studies, Naropa University, and the California Institute of Integral Studies. (A number of dharma centers offer semi-academic, unaccredited study; some of these seem likely eventually to win accreditation.)\n\nProminent European programs include Oxford University and Cambridge University, School of Oriental and African Studies, Humboldt University of Berlin, University of Hamburg, University of Munich, University of Heidelberg, University of Bonn, University of Vienna, Ghent University, and the Sorbonne. In Asia, University of Tokyo and Rissho University have long been a major centers for Buddhist research, and Nalanda University launched a master program at 2016.\n\nCharles Prebish, a scholar-practitioner and Chair of Religious Studies at Utah State University, states that the Buddhist studies and academics in North American universities include those who are practicing Buddhists, the latter he terms as “scholar-practitioners.”.\n\nJournals specializing in Buddhist Studies (in alphabetical order):\n\nIn addition, many scholars publish in journals devoted to area studies (such as Japan, China, etc.), general Religious Studies, or disciplines such as history, anthropology, or language studies.

A number of scholars have published through \"dharma presses\" such as Snow Lion Publications, Wisdom Publications, or Shambhala.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1551204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1551204", "title": "Chiastic structure", "text": "Chiastic structure\n\nChiastic structure, or chiastic pattern, is a literary technique in narrative motifs and other textual passages. An example of chiastic structure would be two ideas, A and B, together with variants A' and B', being presented as A,B,B',A'. Alternative names include ring structure, because the opening and closing 'A' can be viewed as completing a circle, palistrophe, or symmetric structure. It may be regarded as chiasmus scaled up from clauses to larger units of text.\n\nThese often symmetrical patterns are commonly found in ancient literature such as the epic poetry of the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\". Classicist Bruno Gentili describes this technique as \"the cyclical, circular, or 'ring' pattern (\"ring composition\"). Here the idea that introduced a compositional section is repeated at its conclusion, so that the whole passage is framed by material of identical content\". Meanwhile in classical prose, scholars often find chiastic narrative techniques in the \"Histories\" of Herodotus: \"Herodotus frequently uses ring composition or ‘epic regression’ as a way of supplying background information for something discussed in the narrative. First an event is mentioned briefly, then its precedents are reviewed in reverse chronological order as far back as necessary; at that point the narrative reverses itself and moves forward in chronological order until the event in the main narrative line is reached again.\" Various chiastic structures are also seen in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, and the Quran. \n\nChiastic structures also appear in Ancient Greek sculpture. The contrapposto technique of sculpture in Ancient Greek sculpture often lead to this chiastic structure, such as in the Diadumenos of Polykleitos.\n\nThe term \"chiastic\" derives from the mid-17th century term chiasmus, which refers to a \"crosswise arrangement\" of concepts or words that are repeated in reverse order. \"Chiasmus\" derives from the Greek word \"khiasmos\", a word that is \"khiazein\", marked with the letter \"khi\". From \"khi\" comes \"chi\".\n\n\"Chi\" is made up of two lines crossing each other as in the shape of an \"X\". The line that starts leftmost on top, comes down, and is rightmost on the bottom, and vice versa. If one thinks of the lines as concepts, one sees that concept A, which comes first, is also last, and concept B, which comes after A, comes before A. If one adds in more lines representing other concepts, one gets a chiastic structure with more concepts.\nSee Proverbs 1:20-33; vs 20-21=A, v 22=B, v 23=C, vs 24-25=D, vs 26-28=E, vs 29-30=D', v 31=C', v 32=B', v 33=A'.\n\nOral literature is especially rich in chiastic structure, possibly as an aid to memorization. In his study of the Iliad and the Odyssey, Cedric Whitman, for instance, finds a chiastic structure \"of the most amazing virtuosity\" that simultaneously performed both aesthetic and mnemonic functions, permitting the oral poet to easily recall the basic formulae of the composition during performances.\n\nIn 1986, William H. Shea proposed that the Book of Daniel is composed of a \"double-chiasm\". He argued that the chiastic structure is emphasized by the two languages that the book is written in: Aramaic and Hebrew. The first chiasm is written in \"Aramaic\" from chapters 2-7 following an ABC...CBA pattern. The second chiasm is in \"Hebrew\" from chapters 8-12, also using the ABC...CBA pattern. However, Shea represents Daniel 9:26 as \"D\", a break in the center of the pattern.\n\nGordon Wenham has analyzed the Genesis Flood narrative and has shown that it is essentially an elaborate chiasm. Based on the earlier study of grammatical structure by F. I. Andersen, Wenham illustrated a chiastic structure as displayed in the following two tables.\n\nWithin this overall structure, there is a numerical mini-chiasm of 7s, 40s, and 150s:\nThe two mentions of the 150 days refer to the same period, and the first 40 days (7:13,17) are part of the 150 days. All this is consistent with the date in 8:4. There was no compelling reason to repeat the first 7-day figure of waiting to enter the Ark except for the corresponding two 7-day figures for the dove. The second mention of the 150 days was also because of the chiasmus. The chiastic structure explains the repetition of these figures. Before these ancient literary conventions were recognized, followers of the Documentary Hypothesis explained the repetition by hypothesizing two different authors or redactors (J or Jahwist and P or Priestly sources). The repetition may also show the literary artistry of a single author or editor, either working from one tradition or weaving together the J and P sources in chiastic fashion.\n\nWhile there are many examples of chiastic structure in the Quran, perhaps the most well known is in the 'Verse of the Throne' or 'Ayat al-Kursi'. The verse contains 9 sentences which exhibit chiasmus, but perhaps more interesting is that it is found in the longest chapter of the Quran, Al-Baqara, which itself contains a fractal chiastic structure in its 286 verses, i.e. where each (outer) chiasm is composed of (inner) chiastic structures reflected in some sense in the analogue outer chiasm. One such analysis of the chapter is shown below (from ; alternate and/or more detail analyses can be found in , , ).\n\nMuhammad Rizvi, an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, has identified chapter-wide chiastic structures in Sura al-Yasin, Sura al-Zukhruf, Sura al-Faatir, Sura al-Qalam, Sura al-Muzammil, and other chapters of the Quran .\n\nChaism in 3 Nephi 5 - Covenant Promises of Jacob\n\nA: as surely as the Lord liveth (3 Nephi 5:24)\n\nB: gather in from the four quarters of the earth (3 Nephi 5:24)\n\nC: restoring all the house of Jacob unto the knowledge of the covenant (3 Nephi 5:25)\n\nC': then shall they know their Redeemer, who is Jesus Christ (3 Nephi 5:26)\n\nB': gathered in from the four quarters of the earth unto their own land (3 Nephi 5:26)\n\nA': as the Lord liveth (3 Nephi 5:26)\n\nChaism in Alma 36 - The Conversion of Alma\n\nA: inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land (Alma 36:1)\n\nB: remembering the captivity of our fathers (Alma 36:2)\n\nC: whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials (Alma 36:3)\n\nD: \n\nI racked, even with the pains of a damned soul (Alma 36:12)\n\nI remembered...the coming of one Jesus Christ, a Son of God, to atone for the sins of the world (Alma 36:17)\n\nO Jesus, thou Son of God, have mercy on me (Alma 36:19)\n\nI could remember my pains no more (Alma 36:19)\n\nD': \n\nC': I have been supported under trials (Alma 36:27)\n\nB': delivered them out of bondage and captivity (Alma 36:29)\n\nA': inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land (Alma 36:30)\n\nIn literary texts with a possible oral origin, such as \"Beowulf\", chiastic or ring structures are often found on an intermediate level, that is, between the (verbal and/or grammatical) level of chiasmus and the higher level of chiastic structure such as noted in the Torah. John D. Niles provides examples of chiastic figures on all three levels. He notes that for the instances of ll. 12–19, the announcement of the birth of (Danish) Beowulf, are chiastic, more or less on the verbal level, that of chiasmus. Then, each of the three main fights are organized chiastically, a chiastic structure on the level of verse paragraphs and shorter passages. For instance, the simplest of these three, the fight with Grendel, is schematized as follows:\n\nA: Preliminaries\nA': Aftermath\n\nFinally, Niles provides a diagram of the highest level of chiastic structure, the organization of the poem as a whole, in an introduction, three major fights with interludes before and after the second fight (with Grendel's mother), and an epilogue. To illustrate, he analyzes Prologue and Epilogue as follows:\n\nPrologue<br>\nA: Panegyric for Scyld<br>\n\nEpilogue<br>\nA': Eulogy for Beowulf\n\nThe overall chiastic structure of John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\" is also of the ABC…CBA type:\n\nA: Satan's sinful actions (Books 1–3)<br>\nA': Humankind's sinful actions (Books 10–12)\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "89670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=89670", "title": "Child actor", "text": "Child actor\n\nThe term child actor or child actress is generally applied to a child acting on stage or in motion pictures or television, but also to an adult who began their acting career as a child. To avoid confusion, the latter is also called a \"former child actor\". Closely associated is teenage actor or teen actor, an actor who reached popularity as a teenager.\n\nMany child actors find themselves struggling to adapt as they become adults. Lindsay Lohan and Macaulay Culkin are two particular famous child actors who eventually experienced much difficulty with the fame they acquired at a young age. Many child actors also become successful adult actors as well, a prime example of this being Jodie Foster, whose career includes such films like the 1976 film \"Taxi Driver\", the 1991 film \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and the 2007 film \"The Brave One\".\n\nIn the United States, the activities of child actors are regulated by the governing labor union, if any, and state laws. Some projects film in remote locations specifically to evade regulations intended to protect the child. Longer work hours or risky stunts prohibited in California, for example, might be permitted to a project filming in British Columbia. US federal law \"specifically exempted minors working the Entertainment Business from all provisions of the Child Labor Laws.\" Any regulation of child actors is governed by disparate state law.\n\nDue to the large presence of the entertainment industry in California, it has some of the most explicit laws protecting child actors. Being a minor, a child actor must secure an entertainment work permit before accepting any paid performing work. Compulsory education laws mandate that the education of the child actor not be disrupted while the child is working, whether the child actor is enrolled in public school, private school or even home school. The child does his/her schoolwork under the supervision of a studio teacher while on the set.\n\nBefore the 1930s, many child actors never got to see the money they earned because they were not in charge of this money. Jackie Coogan earned millions of dollars from working as a child actor only to see most of it squandered by his parents. In 1939, California weighed in on this controversy and enacted the Coogan Bill which requires a portion of the earnings of a child to be preserved in a special savings account called a blocked trust. A trust that is not actively monitored can also be problematic however as in the case of Gary Coleman who after working from 1974, later sued his adoptive parents and former business advisor for $3.8 million over misappropriation of his trust fund.\n\nSome people also criticize the parents of child actors for allowing their children to work, believing that more \"normal\" activities should be the staple during the childhood years. Others observe that competition is present in all areas of a child's life—from sports to student newspaper to orchestra and band—and believe that the work ethic instilled or the talent developed accrues to the child's benefit.\n\nThe child actor may experience unique and negative pressures when working under tight production schedules. Large projects which depend for their success on the ability of the child to deliver an effective performance add to the pressure.\n\nEthel Merman, who several times worked in long-running stage productions with child actors, disliked what she eventually saw as their overprofessionalization - \"acting more like midgets than children\" - and disapproved of parents pushing adulthood on them.\n\nIn many cases, the failure to retain stardom and success and exposure at a young age has caused many child actors to lead adult lives plagued by legal troubles, bankruptcy and drug abuse.\n\nExamples include the cast members of the American sitcom \"Diff'rent Strokes\", which starred child actors Todd Bridges, Gary Coleman, and Dana Plato. Plato went on to pose for \"Playboy\" magazine and was featured in several softcore pornography films. She was arrested twice for armed robbery and forging prescriptions, and died in May 1999 from an overdose of prescription medication, deemed suicide. Coleman famously sued his parents for misuse of his trust fund and, although awarded over $1,000,000, filed for bankruptcy in 1999. After many charges of assault throughout the next years, Coleman died in May 2010. Bridges was plagued with many legal troubles as well as an addiction to cocaine. After breaking this habit, he traveled across the U.S., touring schools and warning about the dangers of drug abuse. He has since made several cameo appearances on multiple television programs.\n\nThe popular television sitcom \"Full House\" made child stars out of Jodie Sweetin and the Olsen twins. After the show, Sweetin went on to develop an addiction to methamphetamine, as well as alcoholism. She later overcame this and wrote a memoir describing her experiences. Mary-Kate Olsen and Tracey Gold (\"Growing Pains\") developed eating disorders, for which they were treated with intensive rehab. Anissa Jones, of \"Family Affair\" fame, overdosed on August 28, 1976 at age 18.\n\nJonathan Brandis, who appeared in a number of films as a child and teenager, committed suicide in 2003 at the age of 27 due to reasons possibly related to his lack of continued success into adulthood. Likewise, Sawyer Sweeten, a child actor who portrayed Geoffrey Barone on the American sitcom \"Everybody Loves Raymond\", took his life in 2015 at the age of 19 after a period of depression.\n\nDrew Barrymore was notorious for her illegal and public antics beginning shortly after her first role in \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\". Barrymore admits to smoking cigarettes at age nine, drinking alcohol by the time she was eleven, smoking marijuana at the age of twelve, and snorting cocaine at the age of thirteen. At the age of fourteen, she attempted suicide.\n\nAnother popular example today of child actors with post-success troubles would be Lindsay Lohan. Famous for her starring roles in \"The Parent Trap\" (1998), \"Freaky Friday\" (2003), \"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen\" (2004), \"Mean Girls\" (2004), \"\" (2005), \"Just My Luck\" (2006) and \"Georgia Rule\" (2007), Lohan has since run into much trouble with the law. In May 2007, Lohan was arrested on a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI.) Lohan entered the Promises Treatment Center rehabilitation facility where she stayed for 45 days. In July of that year, less than two weeks out of rehab, Lohan was arrested a second time on charges of possession of cocaine, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license. In August, Lohan pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cocaine use and driving under the influence and was sentenced to an alcohol education program, community service, one day in jail, and was given three years probation. The same month Lohan entered the Cirque Lodge Treatment Center in Sundance, Utah for a third stint at rehabilitation, staying for three months until her discharge in October. In November Lohan served 84 minutes in jail. A sheriff spokesman cited overcrowding and the nonviolent nature of the crime as reasons for the reduced sentence.\n\nIn 1990, actor and writer Paul Petersen founded a support group for child actors, \"A Minor Consideration\", following the suicide of another former child star, Rusty Hamer. The group seeks to improve working conditions for child actors and to assist in the transition to adult life, whether in acting or other professions.\n\nThere are many instances of troubled adult lives due to the stressful environment to which child actors are subjected. It is common to see a child actor grow up in front of the camera, whether in films, television shows or both. However, it is not uncommon to see child actors continue their careers throughout as actors or in a different professional field.\n\nJodie Foster, who started to act at the age of 3, became the most quintessential child actor during the 1970s with roles in films like \"Tom Sawyer\" (1973) \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\" (1974), \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), \"Bugsy Malone\" (1976), \"The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane\" (1976), and \"Freaky Friday\" (1977). She garnered her first Academy Award nomination at the age of 14 and later took a sabbatical from films to attend Yale University. She made a successful transition to adult roles, winning two Academy Awards for Best Actress before the age of 30, and starring in numerous successful and acclaimed films like; \"The Accused\" (1988), \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991), \"Nell\" (1994), \"Maverick\" (1994), \"Contact\" (1997), and \"The Brave One\" (2007). Thus, establishing herself as one of the most accomplished actresses of all-time. She has also ventured into direction, with her directing credits including films like \"Little Man Tate\" (1991) and \"Money Monster\" (2016) and television shows like \"House of Cards\", \"Orange is the New Black\" and \"Black Mirror\".\n\nNow adults, the cast of \"Harry Potter\" (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint) were all featured in each of the eight installments of the movie franchise, and continue to act in feature films and theater in their late twenties and early thirties.\n\nDakota Fanning, who rose to prominence after her breakthrough performance at age seven in the 2001 film \"I Am Sam\". Her performance earned her a nomination for a Screen Actors Guild Award at age eight in 2002, making her the youngest nominee in history. She later appeared in the mega productions of Hollywood in such acclaimed blockbuster films as \"Man on Fire\", \"War of the Worlds\", \"Charlotte's Web\", \"Hounddog\", \"The Secret Life of Bees\", \"Coraline\", \"The Runaways\", \"The Motel Life\", and the franchise \"The Twilight Saga\". Fanning's younger sister, Elle Fanning is also a child and teen actress who has starred in many film roles since before she turned 3.\n\nMiranda Cosgrove, known mainly for her role on \"Drake & Josh\" as a child gained more attention in her role as a teenager in the show \"iCarly\". Since the end of the show she has been featured in other roles, including as the voice of Margo in \"Despicable Me\" and its sequel, \"Despicable Me 2\". Once she was of age she decided to pursue a college degree in film at the University of Southern California.\n\nShirley Temple became a public figure and diplomat beginning in the 1960s. Some of her duties included representing the United Nations, and becoming a US ambassador in countries such as Ghana and Czechoslovakia.\n\nMary-Kate Olsen was treated for an eating disorder, deemed anorexia, but her twin sister remained less troubled. In an article with the magazine \"Marie Claire\", Mary-Kate expressed the bittersweet nature of the twins' childhood. \"I look at old photos of me, and I don't feel connected to them at all,\" she said. \"I would never wish my upbringing on anyone... but I wouldn't take it back for the world.\" The twins now have continued success in the fashion industry with an estimated net worth of approximately $100 million.\n\nDrew Barrymore started acting at three years of age. During her childhood she battled with drugs, but today she continues to act in films. Natalie Portman took a small break in acting to get a bachelor's degree in Psychology from Harvard University before continuing her career as an actress. Rider Strong, known as “Shawn Hunter” in \"Boy Meets World\", was educated at Columbia University and now runs a successful blog and published a graphic novel. Neil Patrick Harris got his acting start in \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" He continues to act in television, films and theater.\n\nJonathan Lipnicki, known mostly for the \"Stuart Little\" films, now successfully competes in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. Sara Gilbert is known for her role on \"Roseanne\" and is now successful as a talk show host on \"The Talk.\" Also from \"Rosanne\", Michael Fishman continued to work in film, but behind the scenes and has since been nominated for an Emmy in the work he did in \"Sports Science\".\n\nRoddy McDowall, who had a long and distinguished career including as the regular star of the \"Planet of the Apes\" series; Micky Dolenz, who started his career as a child star in the 1950s, grew up to be a musician of the successful 1960s pop group The Monkees, which had its own successful television show; Ron Howard, who, in addition to being the star of both of the long running \"The Andy Griffith Show\" and \"Happy Days\" television series, became an Oscar-winning director in adulthood; Elijah Wood, who continued his career successfully into adulthood playing Frodo Baggins in \"The Lord of the Rings\" film series and starring as Ryan Newman in the T.V. series \"Wilfred\". Other child actors who have continued their careers into adulthood include Rose Marie, Hayley Mills, Ann Jillian, Johnny Whitaker, Kathy Garver, Tim Matheson, Bonnie Franklin, Melissa Gilbert, Danielle Brisebois, Erika Eleniak, Max Pomeranc, Christina Ricci, Shelley Fabares, Candace Cameron Bure, Karron Graves, Gaby Hoffmann, Hilary Duff, Molly Ringwald, Stacy Ferguson, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Lisa Whelchel, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Soleil Moon Frye, Melissa Joan Hart, Dean Stockwell, Fred Savage, Neil Patrick Harris, Michelle Chia, Shawn Lee, Joshua Ang, Aloysius Pang, and other Academy Award winners and nominees include; Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Jake Gyllenhaal, Joaquin Phoenix, Helen Hunt, Irene Cara, Reese Witherspoon, Hilary Swank, Christian Bale, Saoirse Ronan, Brie Larson, Elizabeth Taylor, and Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nMany actors' careers are short-lived and this is also true of child actors. Peter Ostrum, for example, is now a successful large-animal veterinarian after a starring role in \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\". Shirley Temple became a public figure and diplomat. Jenny Lewis, formerly of \"Troop Beverly Hills\", is a well-known indie rock musician.\n\nIn Poland, child actor identical twin brothers Lech and Jarosław Kaczyński became very successful politicians, at one time Lech being President and Jarosław the Prime Minister.\n\n\n"}

There is a Chinese saying: \"good things come in pairs\". It is common to repeat characters in product brand names, such as the character 喜 (), can be repeated to form the character 囍 (). \nIn Cantonese, 2 (二 or 兩, ) is homophone with the characters for \"easy\" (易, ) and \"bright\" (亮, ). \n\nThe number 3 (三, ) sounds like 生 (), which means \"to live\" or \"life\" so it's considered a good number. It's significant since it is one of three important stages in a person’s life (birth, marriage, and death).<br>On the other hand, number 3 (三,) sounds like 散 () which means \"to split\" or \"to separate\" or \"to part ways\" or \"to break up with\" so it's a bad number too.\n\nThe number 4 (四, ) is considered an unlucky number in Chinese because it is nearly homophonous to the word \"death\" (死 ). \nThus, some buildings in East Asia omit floors and room numbers containing 4, similar to the Western practice of some buildings not having a 13th floor because 13 is considered unlucky. \nWhere East Asian and Western cultures blend, such as in Hong Kong, it is possible in some buildings that the thirteenth floor along with all the floors with 4s to be omitted. Thus a building whose top floor is numbered 100 would in fact have just eighty one floors.\n\nThe number 5 (五, ) sounds like \"not\" in Mandarin (無, ) and Cantonese (唔, ). \n\nFive is also associated with the five elements (Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, and Metal) in Chinese philosophy, and in turn was historically associated with the Emperor of China. For example, the Tiananmen gate, being the main thoroughfare to the Forbidden City, has five arches.\n\nThe number 6 (六, ) in Mandarin sounds like \"slick\" or \"smooth\" (溜, ). In Cantonese, 6 () sounds like \"good fortune\" or \"happiness\" (祿, 樂 ).\nTherefore six is considered a good number for business.\n\nThe number 7 (七, ) in Mandarin sounds like \"even\" in Mandarin (齊, ), so it is a good number for relationships. It also sounds like \"arise\" (起, ) and \"life essence\" (氣, ) in Mandarin.\nSeven can also be considered an unlucky number since the 7th month (July) is a \"ghost month\". It also sounds like \"to deceive\" (欺, ) in Mandarin.\nIn Cantonese, 7 () sounds like 𨳍 (), which is a vulgar way of saying \"penis\".\n\nThe number 8 (八, ) sounds like \"發\" ().\nThere is also a visual resemblance between 88 and 囍 (), a popular decorative design composed of two stylized characters 喜 ().\n\nThe number 8 is viewed as such an auspicious number that even being assigned a number with several eights is considered very lucky.\n\nThe number 9 (九, ) was historically associated with the Emperor of China, and the number was frequently used in matters relating to the Emperor, before the establishment of the imperial examinations officials were organized in the nine-rank system, the nine bestowments were rewards the Emperor made for officials of extraordinary capacity and loyalty, while the nine familial exterminations was one of the harshest punishments the Emperor sentenced; the Emperor's robes often had nine dragons, and Chinese mythology held that the dragon has nine children.\nAlso, the number 9 sounds like \"long lasting\" (久, ), so it is often used in weddings.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Foreshadowing often appears at the beginning of a story, or a chapter, and it helps the reader develop expectations about the upcoming events. \n\nA writer may implement foreshadowing in many different ways. Some of these ways include: character dialogues, plot events, and changes in setting. Even the title of a work or a chapter can act as a clue that suggests what is going to happen. Foreshadowing in fiction creates an atmosphere of suspense in a story, so that the readers are interested and want to know more.\n\nThis literary device is generally used to build anticipation in the minds of readers about what might happen next, thus adding dramatic tension to a story. Moreover, foreshadowing can make extraordinary and bizarre events appear credible, as the events are predicted beforehand so that readers are mentally prepared for them. \n\nThis literary device is frequently adapted for use by composers of theatrical music, in the composition of operas, musicals, radio, film, television, gaming, podcast, and internet scores and underscores, and incidental music for spoken theatrical productions.\n\nForeshadowing is often confused with other literary techniques. Some of these techniques include:\nBy analogy to foreshadowing, the literary critic Gary Morson describes its opposite, sideshadowing. Found notably in the epic novels of Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky, it is the practice of including scenes that turn out to have no relevance to the plot. This, according to Morson, increases the verisimilitude of the fiction because the audience knows that in real life, unlike in novels, most events are in fact inconsequential. This \"sense of structurelessness\" invites the audience to \"interpret and question the events that actually do come to pass\".\n"}

It featured four of the top freerunning and parkour teams in the United States participating in a parkour competition. Each week, the athletes competed in different parkour challenges spread out across the streets of Seattle. The series ran for eight episodes and was not renewed for a second season. Team Tempest, led by Levi Meeuwenberg and Brian Orosco of American Ninja Warrior fame, won the competition.\n\n\"Jump City: Seattle\" was promoted as the first American championship parkour competition. It was hosted by G4 correspondent Blair Herter and Parkour veteran Brady Romberg. Filming of the show was based in Seattle, and the show was produced by Fremantle Media, North America. The series premiere aired on February 15, 2011 with the season finale episode airing on April 5, 2011.\n\nThe show follows four teams participating in the Pro Parkour League (PPL), which was created specifically for the show. Four locations were used for the competition: Seattle City Hall, Freeway Park, Pioneer Square, Seattle Center, and Qwest Field.\n\nAfter the show aired, several athletes competed in the subsequent season of American Ninja Warrior, which then aired on G4. Two of the show's participants, Drew Drechsel and David \"Young Flip\" Rodriguez, remain top competitors to this day.\n\nEach episode featured two of the four teams competing in a parkour \"match\", which consisted of two rounds: the Speed round and the Freestyle round. Should the teams split the two rounds, a sudden death tiebreaker would be used.\n\nDuring the Pro Parkour League regular season, the four teams competed in a round-robin format, with the second and third placed teams competing in the semifinal match for the right to face the first place team in the Championship match at Qwest Field.\n\nThree of the four members of the team participated in a relay race through a pre-determined set of parkour obstacles. Each leg of the relay had several \"fly zones\"; the competitors were required to touch every \"fly zone\" in their leg but were allowed to use any means by which to reach them. The team would incur a five-second penalty for each missed \"fly zone\". The team that completed the course the fastest, after penalties, won the round.\n\nThree of the four members of the team received 45 seconds each to perform a freestyle parkour routine, utilizing anything in the area. After their run, competitors were judged on a scale of 1 to 10. Judging consisted of three elements:\nThe team with the higher sum of their three scores won the round.\n\nShould a sudden death tiebreaker be required, one member of each team would perform another parkour routine, this time lasting just 30 seconds. Judging worked the same as the freestyle round. The team with the higher score was declared the winner.\n\nBased in Los Angeles, Tempest Freerunning was founded in 2007. Many of the team's members work as stuntmen in Hollywood.\n\nMiami Freerunning emanates from Miami, Florida. The team members met in 2008. In order to become an official member, they have a ritual of being shot with a stun gun.\n\nFounded in Washington, D.C., Tribe is America's first parkour team.

This is being able to take your life into your own hands, so it wouldn't just be about kids on YouTube doing crazy stuff.\"\n\nTeam Rogue was specifically created for the show with the intent on highlighting up-and-coming freerunners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: The course was entirely changed from its Week 1 set-up so as not to give Team Rogue an advantage.\n\n(C) = Championship Berth / (X) = Eliminated / * = Eliminated in the play-offs\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "298070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298070", "title": "Law and economics", "text": "Law and economics\n\nLaw and economics or economic analysis of law is the application of economic theory (specifically microeconomic theory) to the analysis of law that began mostly with scholars from the Chicago school of economics. Economic concepts are used to explain the effects of laws, to assess which legal rules are economically efficient, and to predict which legal rules will be promulgated.\n\nAs used by lawyers and legal scholars, the phrase \"law and economics\" refers to the application of microeconomic analysis to legal problems. Because of the overlap between legal systems and political systems, some of the issues in law and economics are also raised in political economy, constitutional economics and political science.\n\nApproaches to the same issues from Marxist and critical theory/Frankfurt School perspectives usually do not identify themselves as \"law and economics\". For example, research by members of the critical legal studies movement and the sociology of law considers many of the same fundamental issues as does work labeled \"law and economics,\" though from a vastly different perspective.\n\nThe one wing that represents a non-neoclassical approach to \"law and economics\" is the Continental (mainly German) tradition that sees the concept starting out of the governance and public policy (\"Staatswissenschaften\") approach and the German Historical school of economics; this view is represented in the \"Elgar Companion to Law and Economics\" (2nd ed. 2005) and—though not exclusively—in the \"European Journal of Law and Economics\". Here, consciously non-neoclassical approaches to economics are used for the analysis of legal (and administrative/governance) problems.\n\nAs early as in the 18th century, Adam Smith discussed the economic effects of mercantilist legislation. However, to apply economics to analyze the law regulating nonmarket activities is relatively new. A European law & economics movement around 1900 did not have any lasting influence. In 1961, Ronald Coase and Guido Calabresi independently from each other published two groundbreaking articles: \"The Problem of Social Cost\" and \"Some Thoughts on Risk Distribution and the Law of Torts\". This can be seen as the starting point for the modern school of law and economics.\n\nHarold Luhnow, the head of the Volker Fund, not only financed F. A. Hayek in the U.S. starting in 1946, but he shortly thereafter financed Aaron Director's coming to the University of Chicago in order to set up there a new center for scholars in law and economics. The University was headed by Robert Maynard Hutchins, a close collaborator of Luhnow's in setting up this \"Chicago School\". The University already had Frank Knight, George Stigler, Henry Simons, and Ronald Coase—a strong base of libertarian scholars. Soon, it would also have not just Hayek himself, but Director’s brother-in-law and Stigler's friend Milton Friedman, and also Robert Fogel, Robert Lucas, Eugene Fama, Richard Posner, and Gary Becker.\n\nThe historians Robert van Horn and Philip Mirowski described these developments, in their \"The Rise of the Chicago School of Economics\" chapter in \"The Road from Mont Pelerin \"(2009); and historian Bruce Caldwell (a great admirer of von Hayek) filled in more details of the account in his chapter, \"The Chicago School, Hayek, and Neoliberalism\", in \"Building Chicago Economics\" (2011). Van Horn (a Hayek critic) filled in yet more details of this history in a \"Seattle University Law Review\" article (\"Chicago's Shifting Attitude Toward Concentrations of Business Power [1934–1962]\") explaining how the influence of Luhnow and other corporate funders wrenched the Chicago School away from its predecessors' common support for anti-trust. Van Horn argues that the opposition to antitrust, and the acceptance of corporate monopoly power and control by oligopolies (such as Germany's and Italy's fascists had always supported), which came to be championed by Robert Bork and others at Chicago, had their actual origins in America's corporate boardrooms.\n\nIn 1958, Director founded the \"Journal of Law & Economics\", which he co-edited with Nobel laureate Ronald Coase, and which helped to unite the fields of law and economics with far-reaching influence. In 1962, he helped to found the Committee on a Free Society.\nDirector's appointment to the faculty of the University of Chicago Law School in 1946 began a half-century of intellectual productivity, although his reluctance about publishing left few writings behind. He taught antitrust courses at the law school with Edward Levi, who eventually would serve as Dean of Chicago's Law School, President of the University of Chicago, and as U.S. Attorney General in the Ford administration.\nAfter retiring from the University of Chicago School of Law in 1965, Director relocated to California and took a position at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. He died September 11, 2004, at his home in Los Altos Hills, California, ten days before his 103rd birthday.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Henry Manne (a former student of Coase) set out to build a center for law and economics at a major law school. He began at Rochester, worked at Miami, but was soon made unwelcome, moved to Emory, and ended up at George Mason. The last soon became a center for the education of judges—many long out of law school and never exposed to numbers and economics. Manne also attracted the support of the John M. Olin Foundation, whose support accelerated the movement. Today, Olin centers (or programs) for Law and Economics exist at many universities.\n\nEconomic analysis of law is usually divided into two subfields: positive and normative.\n\n'Positive law and economics' uses economic analysis to predict the effects of various legal rules. So, for example, a positive economic analysis of tort law would predict the effects of a strict liability rule as opposed to the effects of a negligence rule. Positive law and economics has also at times purported to explain the development of legal rules, for example the common law of torts, in terms of their economic efficiency.\n\n\"Normative law and economics\" goes one step further and makes policy recommendations based on the economic consequences of various policies. The key concept for normative economic analysis is efficiency, in particular, allocative efficiency.\n\nA common concept of efficiency used by law and economics scholars is Pareto efficiency. A legal rule is Pareto efficient if it could not be changed so as to make one person better off without making another person worse off. A weaker conception of efficiency is Kaldor-Hicks efficiency. A legal rule is Kaldor-Hicks efficient if it could be made Pareto efficient by some parties compensating others as to offset their loss.\n\nImportant figures include the Nobel Prize–winning economists Ronald Coase and Gary Becker, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit judges Frank Easterbrook and Richard Posner, Andrei Shleifer and other distinguished scholars such as Robert Cooter, Hans-Bernd Schäfer, Henry Manne, William Landes, and A. Mitchell Polinsky. Guido Calabresi, judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, wrote in depth on this subject; his book \"\" (1970) has been cited as influential in its extensive treatment of the proper incentives and compensation required in accident situations.\nCalabresi took a different approach in \"Ideals, Beliefs, Attitudes, and the Law\" (1985), where he argued, \"who is the cheapest avoider of a cost, depends on the valuations put on acts, activities and beliefs by the whole of our law and not on some objective or scientific notion\" (69).\n\nThe economic analysis of law has been influential in the United States as well as elsewhere. Judicial opinions use economic analysis and the theories of law and economics with some regularity, in the US but also, increasingly, in Commonwealth countries and in Europe. The influence of law and economics has also been felt in legal education, with graduate programs in the subject being offered in a number of countries. The influence of law and economics in civil law countries may be gauged from the availability of textbooks of law and economics, in English as well as in other European languages (Schäfer and Ott 2004; Mackaay 2013).\n\nMany law schools in North America, Europe, and Asia have faculty members with a graduate degree in economics. In addition, many professional economists now study and write on the relationship between economics and legal doctrines. Anthony Kronman, former dean of Yale Law School, has written that \"the intellectual movement that has had the greatest influence on American academic law in the past quarter-century [of the 20th Century]\" is law and economics.\n\nDespite its influence, the law and economics movement has been criticized from a number of directions. This is especially true of normative law and economics. Because most law and economics scholarship operates within a neoclassical framework, fundamental criticisms of neoclassical economics have been drawn from other, competing frameworks, though there are numerous internal critiques as well. Yet other schools of economic thought have emerged and have been applied to the work of law and economics in, for example, the work of Edgardo Buscaglia and Robert Cooter on \"Law and Economics of Development\".\n\nCritics of the law and economics movements have argued that normative economic analysis does not capture the importance of human rights and concerns for distributive justice. Some of the heaviest criticisms of the \"classical\" law and economics come from the critical legal studies movement, in particular Duncan Kennedy and Mark Kelman.\n\nRelatedly, additional critique has been directed toward the assumed benefits of law and policy designed to increase allocative efficiency when such assumptions are modeled on \"first-best\" (Pareto optimal) general-equilibrium conditions. Under the theory of the second best, for example, if the fulfillment of a subset of optimal conditions cannot be met under any circumstances, it is incorrect to conclude that the fulfillment of \"any\" subset of optimal conditions will necessarily result in an increase in allocative efficiency.\n\nConsequently, any expression of public policy whose purported purpose is an unambiguous increase in allocative efficiency (for example, consolidation of research and development costs through increased mergers and acquisitions resulting from a systematic relaxation of anti-trust laws) is, according to critics, fundamentally incorrect, as there is no general reason to conclude that an increase in allocative efficiency is more likely than a decrease.\n\nEssentially, the \"first-best\" neoclassical analysis fails to properly account for various kinds of general-equilibrium feedback relationships that result from intrinsic Pareto imperfections.\n\nAnother critique comes from the fact that there is no unique optimal result. Warren Samuels in his 2007 book, \"The Legal-Economic Nexus\", argues, \"efficiency in the Pareto sense cannot dispositively be applied to the definition and assignment of rights themselves, because efficiency requires an antecedent determination of the rights (23–4)\".\n\nLaw and economics has adapted to some of these criticisms (see \"contemporary developments\", below). One critic, Jon D. Hanson of Harvard Law School, argues that our legal, economic, political, and social systems are unduly influenced by an individualistic model that assumes \"dispositionism\"—the idea that outcomes are the result of our \"dispositions\" (economists would say \"preferences\"). Instead, Hanson argues, we should look to the \"situation\", both inside of us (including cognitive biases) and outside of us (family, community, social norms, and other environmental factors) that have a much larger impact on our actions than mere \"choice\". Hanson has written many law review articles on the subject.\n\nLaw and economics has developed in a variety of directions. One important trend has been the application of game theory to legal problems. Other developments have been the incorporation of behavioral economics into economic analysis of law, and the increasing use of statistical and econometrics techniques. Within the legal academy, the term socio-economics has been applied to economic approaches that are self-consciously broader than the neoclassical tradition.\n\n\n"}

Both are primarily fields of applied ethics, the study of moral values and judgments as they apply to the specific contexts of medicine and military affairs, respectively. MME encompasses the practical application of ethics by military physicians and other healthcare practitioners to dilemmas in military clinical and public health settings in which the patients may be friendly or enemy personnel or in which civilians are affected by military operations.\n\nWithin a garrison (peacetime or non-deployed) setting, precepts of MME may not differ much from medical ethics in a civilian context and usually employ the same decision-making processes. (Military physicians in the United States, for example, are licensed by at least one of the state medical boards and so are required to practice medicine according to the ethical stipulations of that state.) There is an intrinsic dichotomy, however, between medicine’s healing mission and a military’s (sometimes) destructive operations. Because military operations may result in the injury or death of enemy personnel (often deliberately so) and may involve the detention and interrogation of captured enemy personnel, medical ethics considerations for clinical providers assigned or attached to a military unit in a deployment or combat situation cannot always be identical to those in the civilian world. Ethical conflicts may emerge in the tension between responsibilities to the patient and duties to the command structure. The degree to which principles of medical ethics may justifiably be informed by, or even altered to accommodate, issues of national security is controversial.\n\nDiscussions of MME often take as a point of departure the lessons to be learned from the perversion of medical practice by military physicians and others in the period leading up to and during World War II in Germany and Japan. They may also entail the more recently revealed Cold War radiation experiments undertaken by the United States government. Such discussions often center upon questions of whether these widely deplored activities of the past can be reasonably compared to present-day MME dilemmas.\n\nEagan, Sheena M. “Medicine as a Non-Lethal Weapon: The Ethics of ‘Winning Hearts and Minds’. ” Ethics and Armed Forces.

She is known for helping to establish the Afro-Caribbean women's movement and maintaining that lesbianism is neither an identity, orientation nor sexual preference, but rather a political position. She is one of the most prominent feminist scholars in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nRosa Inés Curiel Pichardo was born on 15 March 1963, in Santiago, Dominican Republic, and attended primary school at the Women's Polytechnic Our Lady of Mercy. After graduating, she enrolled at the Pontificia Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra and obtained a bachelor's degree in Social Work.\n\nIn the late 1980s, she began working at the Dominican Center for Education Studies in Santo Domingo and co-founded \"Ce-mujer\", a women's NGO and advisory group. At the time, there was a nascent feminist movement in the Dominican Republic, which was more closely tied to Latin American identification than to Afro-Caribbean, despite the fact that the country was predominantly Afro-Dominican. It also was more class-focused, in that the movement looked more at the problems of the middle class. Each NGO operated as an autonomous organization, rather than collectively. Efforts were small grassroots activist organizations addressing the needs of individual communities or groups, but two voices, Curiel and Sergia Galvan began pressing for broader discussions on women's issues which included racism and sexism. It was a challenging discussion in the Dominican Republic where the social lens typically classifies Haitians as black and Dominicans as mestizo or mulatto.\nBeginning in the early 1990s, it became apparent that collectivism and nesting were effective in combating intersections of discrimination and that by banding together, NGOs might jointly combat racism and misogyny. Curiel joined the board of an organization called \"Casa por la Identidad de las Mujeres Afro\" (House of Women with African Identity), which aimed to combat the dual-discrimination faced by Afro-Dominican women. The identity politics that Curiel embraced was counter to the governmental aim of creating a homogeneous society, but one that she felt was pivotal. Without embracing their blackness, racism could always be denied. But by claiming their solidarity in attaining socioeconomic, political and cultural parity the women of \"Identidad\" were able to create a collective voice. Soon afterwards, Curiel joined regional organizations such as \"Afro-latino-American Women\" and the \"Afro-Caribbean Network\" and began planning the Primer Encuentro de Mujeres Negras de América Latina y El Caribe (First Meeting of Black Women of Latin America and the Caribbean). The conference, held in Santo Domingo between 19 and 25 July 1992, brought together over 300 participants from 32 countries to discuss how systemic bias has obscured the accomplishments of black women and develop strategies to improve their lives.\n\nCuriel soon began to recognize that her lesbianism was another part of the equation. Though there had been lesbians in the Dominican feminist movement, she recognized that their aspirations could not be transformed into political goals without openness. By 1996, her ideas had congealed into what she called \"feminist lesbianism\". Curiel's theory sets forth the idea that lesbianism is neither an identity, orientation nor sexual preference, but rather a political position, which strives to counterbalance the heteronormativity of laws, media, religion, and other aspects of society. She argues that heterosexuality has erased women's autonomy and that it is only through reclaiming their non-subservient status and daring to assert that men are not needed for their survival, that women will reclaim their freedom. Curiel continued teaching and organizing conferences in the Dominican Republic until 2001.\n\nSoon thereafter, Curiel moved to Mexico, where she began lecturing at the Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo. She was one of the participants in the first lesbian march held in Mexico in 2003. The following year, she went to Europe and was a featured musician at the Teddy Awards in Berlin. While she was there, she met with Jules Falquet from France and Sabine Masson from Switzerland, and they discussed how western feminist theorists and works were shaping feminist discourse. Curiel felt that part of the discussion was missing because Latin American women's voices were not heard in Europe while some European works were not available to Latinas because of language variances. They worked together on a series of articles to bridge this gap in feminist theory.\n\nIn 2006, Curiel moved to Colombia, where she began teaching two courses at the National University of Colombia (UNC), one on Racism and Patriarchy, the other on Lesbian Feminism. Continuing her own studies, Curiel earned a master's degree in social anthropology in Bogotá from UNC in 2010 and began serving as Coordinator of the graduate curriculum for Gender Studies. She has shown interest in decolonial theory, which evaluates not just the ending of colonization, but how entrenched cultural ideas concerning classism, heterosexism and racism can be deconstructed. Among the scholars who have influenced her work are several indigenous women: the Bolivian Julieta Paredes, founder of Mujeres Creando; Yuderkys Espinosa from the Dominican Republic, who evaluates the intersection of ; Breny Mendoza, who critiques transnational feminism for its failure to provide non-colonizing alternatives; the Guatemalan feminist Aura Cumes, who evaluates patriarchy, colonization, indigenous intersections of feminism; and even male theorists, such as Anibal Quijano. As she became more immersed in indigenous and African theory and culture, Curiel recognized that pre-colonial societies, such and the Inca and Aztec along with those in Kenya, South Africa and others, had differing social constructs centering on community strength, rather than top-down power arrangements. She began moving away from transnational feminism in an attempt to understand the underlying causes of oppression. For Curiel, recognizing that poor black women exist and have faced bias, is not sufficient nor is recognition that they have some commonalities with other women. Those who have privilege have the freedom to question their identity in ways that others do not. Curiel posits that until one examines privilege and what is important to specific groups, one cannot fully understand exploitation.\n\nCuriel has lectured throughout Latin America, North America and Europe discussing her various theories. She has been a featured lecturer at many conferences and universities and is considered one of the most prominent Latin American-Caribbean feminist scholars. She has published a wide body of work on \"Négritude\" and feminist theories.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "771465", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=771465", "title": "Ostensive definition", "text": "Ostensive definition\n\nAn ostensive definition conveys the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. This type of definition is often used where the term is difficult to define verbally, either because the words will not be understood (as with children and new speakers of a language) or because of the nature of the term (such as colors or sensations). It is usually accompanied with a gesture pointing to the object serving as an example, and for this reason is also often referred to as \"definition by pointing\". \n\nOstensive definition assumes the questioner has sufficient understanding to recognize the type of information being given. Ludwig Wittgenstein writes: \nSo one might say: the ostensive definition explains the use—the meaning—of the word when the overall role of the word in language is clear. Thus if I know that someone means to explain a colour-word to me the ostensive definition \"That is called 'sepia' \" will help me to understand the word... One has already to know (or be able to do) something in order to be capable of asking a thing's name. But what does one have to know?\nThe limitations of ostensive definition are exploited in a famous argument from the \"Philosophical Investigations\" (which deal primarily with the philosophy of language), the private language argument, in which Wittgenstein asks if it is possible to have a private language that no one else can understand.\n\nJohn Passmore states that the term was first defined by the British logician William Ernest Johnson (1858–1931):\n\n\"His neologisms, as rarely happens, have won wide acceptance: such phrases as \"ostensive definition\", such contrasts as those between ... \"determinates\" and \"determinables\", \"continuants\" and \"occurrents\", are now familiar in philosophical literature\" (Passmore 1966, p. 344).\nThe term ostension is also used by those who study folklore and urban legends to indicate real-life happenings that parallel the events told in pre-existing and well-established legends and lore. Semiotician Umberto Eco was the first to use the term to describe the way in which people communicate messages through miming actions, as by holding up a pack of cigarettes to say, \"Would you like one?\" The concept was applied to contemporary legends by folklorists Linda Dégh and Andrew Vázsonyi, who argued that the most direct form of ostension involved committing an actual crime mentioned in a well-known urban legend, such as microwaving someone's pet animal or placing poison in a child's Halloween candy. While such events are rare, the authors stressed that folklorists must recognize \"that fact can become narrative and narrative can become fact.\"\n\nDégh and Vázsonyi, followed by other analysts, argued that there were two other forms of ostension that did not necessarily involve literal acting out of legends.\n\n\"Quasi-ostension\" involves interpretation of ambiguous events in terms of a legend, as when a murder is first believed to have been a \"cult\" sacrifice or \"gang\" murder when in fact the perpetrator had other motives. Many local media panics are based in this form of ostension.\n\n\"Pseudo-ostension\" involves legend-like events intentionally acted out by persons aware of the original narrative. For example, in 1991, \"Ebony\" published a letter written by \"C.J.\" a Dallas-area woman who said she was HIV-positive, but intentionally having sex with as many men as possible. Soon after, a local radio talk-show broadcast a phone call from a woman who said she was the real \"C.J.\" \"I blame it on men, period,\" she said to the talk-show host. \"I'm doing it to all the men because it was a man that gave it to me.\" After a huge spike in males seeking HIV screening in the Dallas-Fort-Worth area, both the author of the letter and the talk-show caller were identified as hoaxers intending to raise consciousness of the disease.\n\nOstension has become an important concept for folklorists studying the ways in which folklore affects everyday people's real lives, ranging from supernatural rituals such as legend tripping to the complex ways in which awareness of AIDS has affected people's sexual habits. Folklorist John McDowell, in an article preceding Dégh and Vázsonyi by a year, explored the relationship between iconicity—representation—and ostension—presentation—in mythic narrative, finding in episodes of ostention a virtual encounter with the experiential substrate, an experience that he termed \"narrative epiphany\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2162018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2162018", "title": "Ottonian art", "text": "Ottonian art\n\nOttonian art is a style in pre-romanesque German art, covering also some works from the Low Countries, northern Italy and eastern France. It was named by the art historian Hubert Janitschek after the Ottonian dynasty which ruled Germany and northern Italy between 919 and 1024 under the kings Henry I, Otto I, Otto II, Otto III and Henry II. With Ottonian architecture, it is a key component of the Ottonian Renaissance (circa 951–1024). However, the style neither began nor ended to neatly coincide with the rule of the dynasty. It emerged some decades into their rule and persisted past the Ottonian emperors into the reigns of the early Salian dynasty, which lacks an artistic \"style label\" of its own. In the traditional scheme of art history, Ottonian art follows Carolingian art and precedes Romanesque art, though the transitions at both ends of the period are gradual rather than sudden. Like the former and unlike the latter, it was very largely a style restricted to a few of the small cities of the period, and important monasteries, as well as the court circles of the emperor and his leading vassals.\n\nAfter the decline of the Carolingian Empire, the Holy Roman Empire was re-established under the Saxon Ottonian dynasty. From this emerged a renewed faith in the idea of Empire and a reformed Church, creating a period of heightened cultural and artistic fervour. It was in this atmosphere that masterpieces were created that fused the traditions from which Ottonian artists derived their inspiration: models of Late Antique, Carolingian, and Byzantine origin. Surviving Ottonian art is very largely religious, in the form of illuminated manuscripts and metalwork, and was produced in a small number of centres for a narrow range of patrons in the circle of the Imperial court, as well as important figures in the church. However much of it was designed for display to a wider public, especially of pilgrims.\n\nThe style is generally grand and heavy, sometimes to excess, and initially less sophisticated than the Carolingian equivalents, with less direct influence from Byzantine art and less understanding of its classical models, but around 1000 a striking intensity and expressiveness emerge in many works, as \"a solemn monumentality is combined with a vibrant inwardness, an unworldly, visionary quality with sharp attention to actuality, surface patterns of flowing lines and rich bright colours with passionate emotionalism\".\n\nFollowing late Carolingian styles, \"presentation portraits\" of the patrons of manuscripts are very prominent in Ottonian art, and much Ottonian art reflected the dynasty's desire to establish visually a link to the Christian rulers of Late Antiquity, such as Constantine, Theoderic, and Justinian as well as to their Carolingian predecessors, particularly Charlemagne. This goal was accomplished in various ways. For example, the many Ottonian ruler portraits typically include elements, such as province personifications, or representatives of the military and the Church flanking the emperor, with a lengthy imperial iconographical history. As well as the reuse of motifs from older imperial art, the removal of spolia from Late Antique structures in Rome and Ravenna and their incorporation into Ottonian buildings was a device intended to suggest imperial continuity. This was clearly the intention of Otto I when he removed columns, some of porphyry, and other building materials from the Palace of Theoderic in Ravenna and reused them in his new cathedral at Magdeburg. The one thing the ruler portraits rarely attempt is a close likeness of the individual features of a ruler; when Otto III died, some manuscript images of him were re-purposed as portraits of Henry II without the need being felt to change the features.\n\nIn a continuation and intensification of late Carolingian trends, many miniatures contain presentation miniatures depicting the donors of the manuscripts to a church, including bishops, abbots and abbesses, and also the emperor. In some cases successive miniatures show a kind of relay: in the Hornbach Sacramentary the scribe presents the book to his abbot, who presents it to St Pirmin, founder of Hornbach Abbey, who presents it to St Peter, who presents it to Christ, altogether taking up eight pages (with the facing illuminated tablets) to stress the unity and importance of the \"command structure\" binding church and state, on earth and in heaven.\n\nByzantine art also remained an influence, especially with the marriage of the Greek princess Theophanu to Otto II, and imported Byzantine elements, especially enamels and ivories, are often incorporated into Ottonian metalwork such as book covers. However, if there were actual Greek artists working in Germany in the period, they have left less trace than their predessors in Carolingian times. The manuscripts were both scribed and illuminated by monks with specialized skills, some of whose names are preserved, but there is no evidence as to the artists who worked in metal, enamel and ivory, who are usually assumed to have been laymen, though there were some monastic goldsmiths in the Early Medieval period, and some lay brothers and lay assistants employed by monasteries. While secular jewellery supplied a steady stream of work for goldsmiths, ivory carving at this period was mainly for the church, and may have been centred in monasteries, although (see below) wall-paintings seems to have been usually done by laymen.\n\nOttonian monasteries produced most if not all of the most magnificent medieval illuminated manuscripts. They were a major art form of the time, and monasteries received direct sponsorship from emperors and bishops, having the best in equipment and talent available. The range of heavily illuminated texts was very largely restricted (unlike in the Carolingian Renaissance) to the main liturgical books, with very few secular works being so treated.\n\nIn contrast to manuscripts of other periods, it is very often possible to say with certainty who commissioned or received a manuscript, but not where it was made. Some manuscripts also include relatively extensive cycles of narrative art, such as the sixteen pages of the Codex Aureus of Echternach devoted to \"strips\" in three tiers with scenes from the \"Life of Christ\" and his parables. Heavily illuminated manuscripts were given rich treasure bindings and their pages were probably seen by very few; when they were carried in the grand processions of Ottonian churches it seems to have been with the book closed to display the cover.\n\nThe Ottonian style did not produce surviving manuscripts from before about the 960s, when books known as the \"Eburnant group\" were made, perhaps at Lorsch, as several miniatures in the Gero Codex (now Darmstadt), the earliest and grandest of the group, copy those in the Carolingian Lorsch Gospels. This is the first stylistic group of the traditional \"Reichenau school\". The two other major manuscripts of the group are the sacramentaries named for Hornbach and Petershausen. In the group of four presentation miniatures in the former described above \"we can almost follow ... the movement away from the expansive Carolingian idiom to the more sharply defined Ottonian one\".\nA number of important manuscripts produced from this period onwards in a distinctive group of styles are usually attributed to the scriptorium of the island monastery of Reichenau in Lake Constance, despite an admitted lack of evidence connecting them to the monastery there. C.R. Dodwell was one of a number of dissident voices here, believing the works to have been produced at Lorsch and Trier instead. Wherever it was located, the \"Reichenau school\" specialized in gospel books and other liturgical books, many of them, such as the Munich Gospels of Otto III (c. 1000) and the Pericopes of Henry II (Munich, Bayerische Nationalbibl. clm. 4452, c. 1001–1024), imperial commissions. Due to their exceptional quality, the manuscripts of Reichenau were in 2003 added to the UNESCO Memory of the World International Register.\n\nThe most important \"Reichenau school\" manuscripts are agreed to fall into three distinct groups, all named after scribes whose names are recorded in their books. The \"Eburnant group\" covered above was followed by the \"Ruodprecht group\" named after the scribe of the Egbert Psalter; Dodwell assigns this group to Trier. The Aachen Gospels of Otto III, also known as the Liuthar Gospels, give their name to the third \"Liuthar group\" of manuscripts, most from the 11th century, in a strongly contrasting style, though still attributed by most scholars to Reichenau, but by Dodwell also to Trier.\n\nThe outstanding miniaturist of the \"Ruodprecht group\" was the so-called Master of the \"Registrum Gregorii\", or Gregory Master, whose work looked back in some respects to Late Antique manuscript painting, and whose miniatures are notable for \"their delicate sensibility to tonal grades and harmonies, their fine sense of compositional rhythms, their feelings for the relationship of figures in space, and above all their special touch of reticence and poise\". He worked chiefly in Trier in the 970s and 980s, and was responsible for several miniatures in the influential \"Codex Egberti\", a gospel lectionary made for Archbishop Egbert of Trier, probably in the 980s. However, the majority of the 51 images in this book, which represent the first extensive cycle of images depicting the events of Christ's life in a western European manuscript, were made by two monks from Reichenau, who are named and depicted in one of the miniatures.\n\nThe style of the \"Liuthar group\" is very different, and departs further from rather than returning to classical traditions; it \"carried transcendentalism to an extreme\", with \"marked schematization of the forms and colours\", \"flattened form, conceptualized draperies and expansive gesture\". Backgrounds are often composed of bands of colour with a symbolic rather than naturalistic rationale, the size of figures reflects their importance, and in them \"emphasis is not so much on movement as in gesture and glance\", with narrative scenes \"presented as a quasi-liturgical act, dialogues of divinity\". This gestural \"dumb-show [was] soon to be conventionalized as a visual language throughout medieval Europe\".\n\nThe group were produced perhaps from the 990s to 1015 or later, and major manuscripts include the Munich Gospels of Otto III, the Bamberg Apocalypse and a volume of biblical commentary there, and the Pericopes of Henry II, the best known and most extreme of the group, where \"the figure-style has become more monumental, more rarified and sublime, at the same time thin in density, insubstantial, mere silhouettes of colour against a shimmering void\". The group introduced the background of solid gold to Western illumination.\n\nTwo dedication miniatures added to the Egmond Gospels around 975 show a less accomplished Netherlandish version of Ottonian style. In Regensburg St. Emmeram's Abbey held the major Carolingian Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which probably influenced a style with \"an incisive line and highly formal organization of the page\", giving in the Uta Codex of c. 1020 complex schemes where \"bands of gold outline the bold, squares circles, ellipses, and rhombs that enclose the figures\", and inscriptions are incorporated in the design explicating its complex theological symbolism. This style was to be very influential on Romanesque art in several media.\n\nEchternach Abbey became important under Abbot Humbert, in office from 1028 to 1051, and the pages (as opposed to the cover) of the Codex Aureus of Echternach were produced there, followed by the Golden Gospels of Henry III in 1045–46, which Henry presented to Speyer Cathedral (now Escorial), the major work of the school. Henry also commissioned the Uppsala Gospels for the cathedral there (now in the university library). Other important monastic scriptoria that flourished during the Ottonian age include those at Salzburg, Hildesheim, Corvey, Fulda, and Cologne, where the Hitda Codex was made.\n\nThis scene was often included in Ottonian cycles of the Life of Christ. Many show Jesus (with crossed halo) twice, once asleep and once calming the storm.\n\nObjects for decorating churches such as crosses, reliquaries, altar frontals and treasure bindings for books were all made of or covered by gold, embellished with gems, enamels, crystals, and cameos. This was a much older style, but the Ottonian version has distinctive features, with very busy decoration of surfaces, often gems raised up from the main surface on little gold towers, accompanied by \"beehive\" projections in gold wire, and figurative reliefs in repoussé gold decorating areas between the bars of enamel and gem decoration. Relics were assuming increasing importance, sometimes political, in this period, and so increasingly rich reliquaries were made to hold them. In such works the gems do not merely create an impression of richness, but served both to offer a foretaste of the bejewelled nature of the Celestial city, and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various \"scientific\", medical and magical respects, as set out in the popular lapidary books. The few surviving pieces of secular jewellery are in similar styles, including the crown worn by Otto III as a child, which he presented to the Golden Madonna of Essen after he outgrew it.\n\nExamples of \"crux gemmata\" or processional crosses include an outstanding group in the Essen Cathedral Treasury; several abbesses of Essen Abbey were Ottonian princesses. The Cross of Otto and Mathilde, Cross of Mathilde and the Essen cross with large enamels were probably all given by Mathilde, Abbess of Essen (died 1011), and a fourth cross, the Theophanu Cross came some fifty years later. The Cross of Lothair (Aachen) and Imperial Cross (Vienna) were imperial possessions; Vienna also has the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire. The book cover of the Codex Aureus of Echternach (Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg) is in a very comparable style. Other major objects include a reliquary of St Andrew surmounted by a foot in Trier, and gold altar frontals for the Palace Chapel, Aachen and Basel Cathedral (now in Paris). The Palace Chapel also has the pulpit or Ambon of Henry II. The late Carolingian upper cover of the Lindau Gospels (Morgan Library, New York) and the Arnulf Ciborium in Munich were important forerunners of the style, from a few decades before and probably from the same workshop.\n\nLarge objects in non-precious metals were also made, with the earliest surviving wheel chandeliers from the end of the period, a huge candelabra in Essen, and in particular a spectacular collection of ambitious large bronze works, and smaller silver ones, at Hildesheim Cathedral from the period of Bishop Bernward (died 1022), who was himself an artist, although his biographer was unusually honest in saying that he did not reach \"the peaks of perfection\". The most famous of these is the pair of church doors, the Bernward Doors, with biblical figure scenes in bronze relief, each cast in a single piece, where the powerfully simple compositions convey their meanings by emphatic gestures, in a way comparable to the Reichenau miniatures of the same period. There is also a bronze columnm the Bernward Column, over twelve feet high, originally the base for a crucifix, cast in a single hollow piece. This unusual form is decorated with twenty-four scenes from the ministry of Jesus in a continuous strip winding round the column in the manner of Trajan's Column and other Roman examples.\n\nAround 980, Archbishop Egbert of Trier seems to have established the major Ottonian workshop producing cloisonné enamel in Germany, which is thought to have fulfilled orders for other centres, and after his death in 993 possibly moved to Essen. During this period the workshop followed Byzantine developments (of many decades earlier) by using the \"senkschmelz\" or \"sunk enamel\" technique in addition to the \"vollschmelz\" one already used. Small plaques with decorative motifs derived from plant forms continued to use \"vollschmelz\", with enamel all over the plaque, while figures were now usually in \"senkschmelz\", surrounded by a plain gold surface into which the outline of the figure had been recessed. The Essen cross with large enamels illustrated above shows both these techniques.\n\nMuch very fine small-scale sculpture in ivory was made during the Ottonian period, with Milan probably a site if not the main centre, along with Trier and other German and French sites. There are many oblong panels with reliefs which once decorated book-covers, or still do, with the \"Crucifixion of Jesus\" as the most common subject. These and other subjects very largely continue Carolingian iconography, but in a very different style.\n\nA group of four Ottonian ivory situlae appear to represent a new departure for ivory carving in their form, and the type is hardly found after this period. Situlae were liturgical vessels used to hold holy water, and previously were usually of wood or bronze, straight-sided and with a handle. An aspergillum was dipped in the situla to collect water with which to sprinkle the congregation or other objects. However the four Ottonian examples from the 10th century are made from a whole section of elephant tusk, and are slightly larger in girth at their tops. All are richly carved with scenes and figures on different levels: the Basilewsky Situla of 920 in the Victoria & Albert Museum, decorated with scenes from the \"Life of Christ\" on two levels, the \"Situla of Gotofredo\" of c. 980 in Milan Cathedral, one in the Aachen Cathedral Treasury, and one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. All came from the milieu of the Ottonian court: an inscription says that Archbishop Gotfredus presented the Milan example in anticipation of a visit by the Emperor, also referred to in the London example which was possibly from the same workshop. The latest and most lavish is the Aachen example, which is studded with jewels and shows an enthroned Emperor, surrounded by a pope and archbishops. This was probably made in Trier about 1000.\n\nAmong various stylistic groups and putative workshops that can be detected, that responsible for pieces including the panel from the cover of the Codex Aureus of Echternach and two diptych wings now in Belin (all illustrated below) produced particularly fine and distinctive work, perhaps in Trier, with \"an astonishing perception of the human form ... [and] facility in handling the material\".\n\nA very important group of plaques, now dispersed in several collections, were probably commissioned (perhaps by Otto I) for Magdeburg Cathedral and are called the \"Magdeburg plaques\", the \"plaques from the Magdeburg Antependium\" or similar names. They were probably made in Milan in about 970, to decorate a large flat surface, though whether this was a door, an antependium or altar frontal, the cover of an exceptionally large book, a pulpit, or something else, has been much discussed. Each nearly square plaque measures about 13x12 cm, with a relief scene from the \"Life of Christ\" inside a plain flat frame; one plaque in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York has a \"dedication\" scene, where a crowned monarch presents Christ with a model church, usually taken to be Otto I with Magdeburg Cathedral. Altogether seventeen survive, probably fewer than half of the original set. The plaques include background areas fully cut through the ivory, which would presumably originally have been backed with gold. Apart from the spaces left beside buildings, these openwork elements include some that leave chequerboard or foliage patterns. The style of the figures is described by Peter Lasko as \"very heavy, stiff, and massive ... with extremely clear and flat treatment of drapery ... in simple but powerful compositions\".\n\nAlthough it is clear from documentary records that many churches were decorated with extensive cycles of wall-painting, survivals are extremely rare, and more often than not fragmentary and in poor condition. Generally they lack evidence to help with dating such as donor portraits, and their date is often uncertain; many have been restored in the past, further complicating the matter. Most survivals are clustered in south Germany and around Fulda in Hesse; though there are also important examples from north Italy. There is a record of bishop Gebhard of Constance hiring lay artists for a now vanished cycle at his newly foundation (983) of Petershausen Abbey, and laymen may have dominated the art of wall-painting, though perhaps sometimes working to designs by monastic illuminators. The artists seem to have been rather mobile: \"at about the time of the Oberzell pictures there was an Italian wall-painter working in Germany, and a German one in England\".\n\nThe church of St George at Oberzell on Reichenau Island has the best-known surviving scheme, though much of the original work has been lost and the remaining paintings to the sides of the nave have suffered from time and restoration. The largest scenes show the miracles of Christ in a style that both shows specific Byzantine input in some elements, and a closeness to Reichenau manuscripts such as the Munich Gospels of Otto III; they are therefore usually dated around 980–1000. Indeed, the paintings are one of the foundations of the case for Reichenau Abbey as a major centre of manuscript painting.\n\nVery little wood carving has survived from the period, but the monumental painted figure of Christ on the Gero Cross (around 965–970, Cologne Cathedral) is one of the outstanding masterpieces of the period. Its traditional dating by the church, long thought to be implausibly early, was finally confirmed by dendrochronology. The Golden Madonna of Essen (about 1000, Essen Cathedral, which was formerly the abbey) is a virtually unique survival of a type of object once found in many major churches. It is a smaller sculpture of the Virgin and Child, which is in wood which was covered with gesso and then thin gold sheet. Monumental sculpture remained rare in the north, though there are more examples in Italy, such as the stucco reliefs on the ciborium of Sant' Ambrogio, Milan, and also on that in San Pietro al Monte, Civate, which relate to ivory carving of the same period, and some stone sculpture.\n\nSurviving Ottonian works are very largely those in the care of the church which were kept and valued for their connections with either royal or church figures of the period. Very often the jewels in metalwork were pilfered or sold over the centuries, and many pieces now completely lack them, or have modern glass paste replacements. As from other periods, there are many more surviving ivory panels (whose material is usually hard to re-use) for book-covers than complete metalwork covers, and some thicker ivory panels were later re-carved from the back with a new relief. Many objects mentioned in written sources have completely disappeared, and we probably now only have a tiny fraction of the original production of reliquaries and the like. A number of pieces have major additions or changes made later in the Middle Ages or in later periods. Manuscripts that avoided major library fires have had the best chance of survival; the dangers facing wall-paintings are mentioned above. Most major objects remain in German collections, often still church libraries and treasuries.\n\nThe term \"Ottonian art\" was not coined until 1890, and the following decade saw the first serious studies of the period; for the next several decades the subject was dominated by German art historians mainly dealing with manuscripts, apart from Adolph Goldschmidt's studies of ivories and sculpture in general. A number of exhibitions held in Germany in the years following World War II helped introduce the subject to a wider public and promote the understanding of art media other than manuscript illustrations. The 1950 Munich exhibition \"Ars Sacra\" (\"sacred art\" in Latin) devised this term for religious metalwork and the associated ivories and enamels, which was re-used by Peter Lasko in his book for the \"Pelican History of Art\", the first survey of the subject written in English, as the usual art-historical term, the \"minor arts\", seemed unsuitable for this period, where they were, with manuscript miniatures, the most significant art forms. In 2003 a reviewer noted that Ottonian manuscript illustration was a field \"that is still significantly under-represented in English-language art-historical research\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3496839", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3496839", "title": "Phallocentrism", "text": "Phallocentrism\n\nPhallocentrism is the ideology that the phallus, or male sexual organ, is the central element in the organization of the social world. Phallocentrism has been analyzed in literary criticism, psychoanalysis and psychology, linguistics, medicine and health care, and philosophy. \n\nThe term was coined in 1927 by Ernest Jones, as part of his debate with Freud over the role of the phallic stage in childhood development, when he argued that “men analysts have been led to adopt an unduly phallo-centric view”. Drawing on the earlier arguments of Karen Horney, Jones, in a series of articles, maintained the position that women were not disappointed creatures driven by penis envy. Instead, this belief was itself a theoretical defense against castration anxiety. Freud, however, remained unmoved in his opposition to the Horney/Jones thesis, and his was the predominant psychoanalytic position thereafter, though some like Janet Malcolm would modify his position to the effect that “Freud's concept, of course, is... a \"description\" of phallocentrism, not a recommendation of it”.\n\nJacques Lacan added a linguistic turn to the debate with his article “The Signification of the Phallus” (1958/65), arguing that the phallus was not a part-object, an imaginary object, or a physical organ, but rather “the signifier intended to designate as a whole the effects of the signifier... this signifying function of the phallus”.\n\nJacques Derrida challenged his thesis as phallocentric, and the charge was taken up by second-wave feminism, extending the focus of protest from Lacan to Freud, psychoanalysis, and male-centered thinking as a whole: the way that “[t]he phallus, centre of meaning, became man's identity with himself... a masculine symbolic”.\n\nHowever conflict arose within feminism over the issue. Some French feminists, seeing phallocentrism and feminism as two sides of the same coin, sought to make a postphallicist breakthrough. Others, like the English feminist Jacqueline Rose, while accepting that “Lacan was implicated in the phallocentrism he described,” nevertheless considered his analysis as important for an understanding of how women were constituted as a split subject in society.\n\nFrom a postcolonial perspective, however, such theoretical debates revealed the irrelevance of first world feminists, with their phallocentric preoccupations, to the ordinary life of the subaltern woman in the Third World; and Third-wave feminism, with its concern for the marginalised, the particular, and for intersectionality, has also broadly seen the theoreticism and essentialism of feminism's earlier concern for phallocentrism as irrelevant to daily female experience. Gayatri Spivak suggests that feminism needs to negotiate an accommodation with phallocentrism.\n\n"}

{"id": "31173677", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31173677", "title": "Pioneer Woman", "text": "Pioneer Woman\n\nThe Pioneer Woman monument is a bronze sculpture in Ponca City, Oklahoma, designed by Bryant Baker and dedicated on April 22, 1930. The statue is of a sunbonneted woman leading a child by the hand. It was donated to the State of Oklahoma by millionaire oilman E. W. Marland. He commissioned models from twelve well-known sculptors and financed a nationwide tour to get feedback from art critics and the general public in order to decide which model to use for the final statue.\n\nAround 1925 Marland sketched out an ambitious sculptural program to sculptor Jo Davidson involving numerous statues based on the theme of the settling of the American West and attempted to persuade Davidson to take it on. When Davidson declined Marland replies that he could pay for it, prompting Davidson to come back with \"I don't doubt it for a minute, but I don't see myself working for you for the rest of my life.\" Marland ultimately convinced Davidson to go to Ponca City, Marland's then home town, and create three statues for him: one of Marland and one of each of Marland's adopted children, Lydie and George.\n\nWhile Davidson was producing his three Marland statues E.W. told him of another project that he has in mind, \"E.W.'s most cherished dream.\" Davidson writes, \" It was to be a twenty-five foot figure, which he planned to put up on a hill where it could be seen for miles ... E.W. brought his friends to see what I was doing. He acted as if he was the sculptor, and in conversation would say that he was doing the figure - that I was his hands.\"\n\nMarland's inspiration for this project included his pioneering mother and grandmother.\n\nAt that point Marland sent out invitations to many of America's leading sculptors, offering them each a $10,000 honorarium to produce a roughly tall bronze model for the statue. He further proposed that the models tour the United States and that the American public vote as to which of the models would be erected in Ponca City. Several sculptors, Daniel Chester French, George Grey Barnard and Paul Manship turned Marland down, also declining were the only two women invited, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and Anna Hyatt Huntington, leaving him with an even dozen artists, all males. The artists who submitted models were Bryant Baker, A, Stirling Calder, Jo Davidson, James Earle Fraser, John Gregory, F. Lynn Jenkins, Mario Korbel, Arthur Lee, Hermon Atkins MacNeil, Maurice Sterne, Mahonri Young, and Wheeler Williams. The models were to tour America and everyone who visited the sites where they were exhibited was allowed to vote for their favorite.\n\nMarland's original idea was to have a woman in pioneer dress accompanied by a child, and so he provided a sunbonnet to each sculptor. While the artists were not limited to these ideas, nine of the twelve models included a sunbonnet and all save for Jo Davidson's included a child. Both Davidson and Calder visited Oklahoma to gain further inspiration.\n\nMahonri Young's biographer Thomas Toone relates that Young produced not only the required three foot tall statuette, but also a plaster version of the entire Pioneer Memorial as he envisioned it, replete with detailed bas-reliefs of western scenes around the base of a massive pedestal and platform, on top of which the pioneer woman \"holds her child in the embrace of a Renaissance Madonna.\" A pair of spirited bison guard the stairs leading up the base. The voting public was not privy to Young's vision and his work showed poorly in the balloting. Young, who described not winning the competition as the worst disappointment in his career, did manage to get some of his ideas out in later works.\n\nToone also adds that the winning sculptor, Baker Bryant used, \"a professional actress as his model, which produced a glamorous figure, representing Western myth more than reality.\"\n\nThere are some questions raised about the winning design by Donald De Lue, at that time Baker Bryant's assistant. De Lue's biographer, D. Roger Howlett makes several points about the \"Pioneer Woman\" statue.\n\n\"it was especially on the \"Pioneer Woman\" that De Lue manifest his talent. . . ... Baker claimed that the conception and movement of the final monument was developed in an eight-to-ten inch sketch model made by him a few hours after he learned about the competition. De Lue executed the thirty-three inch competition model for the sculpture in 1927, with Baker supervising and completing the face.\" Baker was also the last sculptor to enter the contest having only one month to prepare his model.\n\nJames Earle Fraser based his almost Impressionistic statue on his favorite aunt, Dora, who was herself a pioneer woman. This model is unique among the ones submitted to the competition, and perhaps in the entire world of \"Pioneer Women\" Statues, in that the woman, caught breast feeding her child, exposes a bare breast. No stranger to multi-tasking, she still manages to hold on to her rifle while feeding the baby.\n\nMany years after the competition Wheeler Williams' model was re-discovered, enlarged, cast, and now sits in front of the public library in Liberty, Kansas.\n\nThe submitted bronze models were unveiled at the Reinhardt Galleries in New York on February 26, 1927 where they remained in exhibition until March 19. At a dinner for the twelve finalists the evening before the models were revealed to the public, Marland announced:\n\nMarland reserved the right to make the final choice for the monument, but he sought input from the public and so these models then began a tour of museums and art galleries across the nation. From its opening at the Reinhardt Galleries, the tour moved on. Stops included Boston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Detroit, Indianapolis, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, Oklahoma City, Fort Worth, and Ponca City. At each location visitors were invited to vote for their three favorite models. In all over 750,000 people viewed the models and over 120,000 votes were placed.\n\nThe models were the subject of much discussion at the time, and photographs of them were included in full-page pictorials of both the \"New York Times\" and the \"LA Times\". Art critics discussed the merits of one model over another and almost universally lambasting the sunbonnets as \"terrible headwear\". The models were even the subject of writing assignments for elementary school art classes.\n\nThe \"L.A. Times\" reported that art critic Helen Appleton Read felt that \"no adequate tribute had been paid to the pioneer woman\" and that \"most of the competitors failed to produce anything monumental\".\n\nOn December 20, 1927, E. W. Marland's son George announced that Bryant Baker's model was selected as the winner. Baker's model received the most votes in 11 cities and Gregory's was the second most popular, being the favorite in three cities.\n\nWhen the tour of the models was over, Baker's \"Pioneer Woman\" had won first place, out-balloting John Gregory's effort 42,478 to 37,782. \"De Lue set to work in 1928 and 1929, modeling it in Baker's Brooklyn studio, working with Jean La Seure, the enlarger. De Lue later remembered: \"One day Bryant decided he would work on it, and did some work. I said, 'Look, Bryant, if I were you I'd get the hell out of here, because you're not helping at all,' He said, 'Thank you very much.' and he went.\"\n\nThe cost of the \"Pioneer Woman\" project was approximately $350,000. This included a $10,000 honorarium for each of the twelve finalists plus $100,000 for the winner Bryant Baker. The remainder of the costs were accrued during the tour around the country and arranging the base for the statue. While the vast majority of the project was funded by Marland, his fortunes were on the decline at this time and so he was forced to seek additional funding to complete the project. Some private fundraising helped to defray the final costs and $25,000 was supplied by Lew Wentz, Marland's long-time business rival as well as fellow philanthropist of Ponca City. After much private debate and encouragement, Lew Wentz in 1929 loaned money to Marland enabling him to make final payments for the statue, secured by a real estate mortgage and arranged by a local banker, resulting in Wentz filing a lawsuit in 1936 to collect on the non-performing loan [see \"Ada Weekly News\", 12 March 1936].\n\nMarland had purchased 2,000 acres on which to place the statue. The area where the statue was erected stands just off of U.S. Route 77, a mile northeast of the center of Ponca City.\n\nBaker said the work took years off of his life and he was afraid he would die before completion.\n\nOn April 16, 1930 it was announced that the statue would be unveiled on April 22, 1930 on the 41st anniversary of the Land Run of 1889 which opened the Oklahoma Territory to settlers. The day was declared a state holiday by the governor and the celebration in Ponca City included a parade, 19-gun salute. An estimated 40,000 people attended the unveiling.\n\nThe dedication itself began at 1:30 pm central time with a nationwide radio address on WJZ by United States President Herbert Hoover broadcasting from the White House. He introduced the native Oklahoman, Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley who had intended to attend the unveiling in person before his visit was curtailed by illness and so spoke from his home. After the first half-hour the broadcast continued from Ponca City. Other speakers during the 90 minute broadcast were Marland, Baker, Episcopal Bishop of Oklahoma Thomas Casady, Oklahoma Governor William J. Holloway, and Oklahoma humorist, Will Rogers, who closed the unveiling ceremonies.\n\nThe area surrounding the statue has been designated as Pioneer Woman State Park.\n\nOn September 16, 1958, the 65th anniversary of the opening of the Cherokee Outlet which included the land of Ponca City, the state opened the Pioneer Woman Museum, on land adjacent to the monument. An image of the \"Pioneer Woman\" statue serves as the de facto logo of the museum.\n\nThe statue resides on a park.\n\nThe bronze statue itself stands tall and weighs . It stands on a pyramidal stepped base of granite blocks which brings the total height of the monument to .\n\nThe statue faces to the southwest, symbolising that the majority of the settlers had come from the northeast.\n\nThere is a plaque on the first step beneath the statue which reads:\n\nThe image of the \"Pioneer Woman\" has long been a symbol of Ponca City.\n\nIn 1941 as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations the General Federation of Women's Clubs presented gold and bronze medals with a bas-relief of the \"Pioneer Woman\" to prominent and long-standing members.\n\nThe statue is also the official emblem of the four-state Ozark Frontier Trail.\n\nWhen the State Quarter for Oklahoma was to be issued in 2008, there was a statewide call for proposals to be sent to the Mint for final design work. From the thousands of designs received, five were sent along to the mint. Four of the five submitted designs included the \"Pioneer Woman\". When the professional designs returned from the mint in order for the people of Oklahoma to decide on the final design by voting amongst them, none of the designs included the book which is held under the \"Pioneer Woman\"s arm. As this book is often thought to be a Bible, this was viewed as an attempt at censorship by the government and caused a statewide controversy. Eventually the fifth design was selected.\n\nThat the book was intended to be the Bible was made clear by Baker in an interview in which he stated, \"In trying to symbolize the Pioneer Woman of America I wanted to depict Courage and Faith... The Bible was a vital factor in building up this country, and it often was the one indispensable book, recording the facts of the family life, of births, marriages and death and often the only reading material available for mothers to teach their children to read and write in those days.\"\n\nThere have been several notable works of sculpture proposed or produced in the years following the unveiling of the \"Pioneer Woman\" based on it. The first one was the Kansas Pioneer Woman Memorial. A competition by the Pioneer Women's Memorial association was held and, as in the competition for the Ponca City statue, Bryant Baker was the winner. A Kansas critic at the time pointed out, \"There is a striking similarity in the appearance of the two works despite many actual differences.\" However this version of a Kansas monument was never completed. In 1937 the Pioneer Women's Memorial association presided over the unveiling of the Kansas Pioneer Memorial by Kansas born sculptor Merrell Gage, a work very different from Baker's.\n\nIn 1959 a 36' tall fiberglass sculpture by Gordon Shumaker was produced to commemorate the first 100 years of the Minnesota State Fair. It stands in front of the Pioneer Building. Like the Ponca City statue, it depicts a bonneted woman in ankle length dress striding forward, and like its predecessor, she holds a large book/Bible in her right crooked arm as well as carrying a large bundle on the same arm. At 36 feet tall she more closely approaches the monumentality that Marland was originally seeking for his work.\n\n\"Hardship and Dreams\" was the title of a sculpture by Dorothy Koelling (1913-2004) unveiled in Wichita, Kansas on June 28, 1994. A newspaper article at that time described the work as being, \"inspired by the monumental 'Pioneer Woman' in Ponca City, Okla.\" Koeling's six foot tall statue depicts the bonneted pioneer woman, carrying a large book/Bible and bundle in her right arm, marching forward with her flatfooted son, whose hand she holds, next to her.\n\n\n"}

It is located on a strategic mountain top, five km to the south of San Vicente de Tagua Tagua, near the dry lagoon (Laguna de Tagua Tagua). This is believed to be the southernmost fort of the Inca Empire.\n\nThe Inca invasion, having advanced beyond the Choapa river, came to Picunche territory. They established in the zone several storage facilities and the fortress of Cerro La Muralla.\n\nLocated on the strategic top of the hill, the fortress is near the lagoon that is now dry.\n\nIt is located between the Cachapoal River and Tinguiririca River.\n\nIt is presumed that the fort was used as point of observation, since from here, the north valley can be controlled. The lagoon was also useful for defence.\n\nIn the top of the Hill, the walls tracing an eagle in flight like another Inca structures. It has three defensive walls and two sectors with housings. Abundant ceramics and stone cups have been found. To 100 m of the first wall they realized works of recognition in the strength, that alone them esplanade, that apparently served as field of cultures. Evidence is that this construction was effected by the Incas, due to the work of the stone in blocks, the dimension of the enclosures and the structural terrace shapes of some sectors. Integral forms a part with Laguna de Tagua Tagua, since it does not have south wall, which was covered by the lagoon.\n\nClaudio Gay described his ascent to Cerro La Muralla, which then was called an Inca fortress. In 1974, scientists of the Chilean National Museum of Natural History, decided that this Indian fortress was constructed before the arrival of the Spanish to this place.\n\nNearby is an image of the Virgin of Fátima, since habitual age in the Spanish Conquest. Any suspicious site of adoration to other deities was covered with icons of Catholic adoration. In this sector every year on the second Sunday of September celebrates a mass, to which he represents a parishioners' great quantity. This hurts the archaeological site.\n\nAt San Vicente of Tagua Tagua there are a project to have a museum and to recover the pieces extracted in the zone and that were extracted of the place by the investigators. In addition one tries to create museums in situ, and to medium term a route controlled to the pucará of The Wall.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "177755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177755", "title": "Puebla (city)", "text": "Puebla (city)\n\nPuebla () (Spanish: Puebla de Zaragoza), formally Heroica Puebla de Zaragoza and also known as Puebla de los Ángeles, is the seat of Puebla Municipality, the capital and largest city of the state of Puebla, and one of the five most important Spanish colonial cities in Mexico. A colonial era-planned city, it is located in (southern) Central Mexico on the main route between the capital, Mexico City, and Mexico's main Atlantic port, Veracruz—about 100km east southeast of Mexico City and about 220 km west of Veracruz. \n\nThe city was founded in 1531 in an area called Cuetlaxcoapan, which means \"where serpents change their skin\", in between of two of the main indigenous settlements at the time, Tlaxcala and Cholula. This valley was not populated in the 16th century as in the pre-Hispanic period; this area was primarily used to the \"flower wars\" between a number of populations. Due to its history and architectural styles ranging from Renaissance to Mexican Baroque, the city was named a World Heritage Site in 1987. The city is also famous for mole poblano, chiles en nogada and Talavera pottery. However, most of its economy is based on industry.\n\nBeing both the fourth largest city in Mexico and the fourth largest Metropolitan area in Mexico, it has a current population of 3,250,000 people, the city serves as one of the main hubs for eastern Central Mexico. Many students come from all over the country to study in its many renowned and prestigious colleges, such as BUAP, UDLAP, Ibero, UPAEP and Tecnológico de Monterrey, among others. The city also excels because of its industry, with the world's largest Volkswagen factory outside Germany located in the Municipality of Cuautlancingo and Audi plant in San José Chiapa being the most technologically advanced plant in the western hemisphere. As a result, many suppliers to Volkswagen and Audi assembly plants have opened factories in the metropolitan area of Puebla.\n\nSome historians consider that the area where the city is located nowadays was not inhabited in the Pre-Columbian era, except in the 15th century, when this valley was set aside for use for the so-called Flower Wars among the populations of Itzocan, Tepeaca, Huejotzingo, Texmelucan and Tlaxcala, with those soldiers captured being used as sacrifice victims.\n\nThe foundation of Puebla begins with a letter from the bishop of Tlaxcala in 1530, Julián Garcés, to the Spanish queen outlining the need for a Spanish settlement between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz. According to legend, the bishop had a dream about where to build the city. In this dream, he saw a valley with woods and meadows crossed by a clear river and dotted with fresh-water springs on fertile land. While he was contemplating this scenery, he supposedly saw a group of angels descend from heaven and trace out the city. Convinced he had seen a divine vision, he celebrated Mass, and took some of the brothers out in search of the place. Five leagues from the monastery he declared they had found the place shown in the dream. This legend is the source of Puebla’s original name, Puebla de los Ángeles, and its current nickname Angelópolis (literally, \"City of Angels\").\n\nThe city's coat of arms refers to a city (the castle with 5 towers) which is protected by angels; the letters K. V. refer to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (), also referred to as Charles I of Spain; below are 7 rivers which cross the city.\n\nThe city was founded in 1531 within the Valley of Cuetlaxcoapan as a Spanish city, not on the foundation of an existing indigenous city-state. Official date of foundation is 16 April 1531, however, this first attempt at settlement failed due to constant flooding of the site right next to the river. Several rivers flow through the Valley of Puebla, the San Francisco, Atoyac and the Alseseca. This valley was bordered by the indigenous city-states turned colonial towns of Cholula, Tlaxcala, Huejotzingo and Tepeaca, all of which had large indigenous populations. After the city’s foundation, this valley became the main route between Mexico City and Veracruz, the port on the Caribbean coast and the connection to Spain.\n\nPuebla was an important city and region in the history of New Spain, since it was in the center region of Spanish settlement, midway between the main port and the capital, had a large indigenous population, and drew many Spanish settlers. It supplied the capital with commercially grown agricultural products and became a center of local textile production. It was well connected to Mexico's North, particularly the silver-mining region around Zacatecas.\n\nMost of the population moved away from the west bank of the San Francisco River to a higher site. A few families remained behind and renamed the original settlement Alto de San Francisco. The Spanish Crown supported the founding of Puebla as a city without encomiendas, as this system was being abused and a number of Spaniards were finding themselves landless. Puebla received its coat-of-arms in 1538, and the titles \"Noble y Leal\" (Noble and Loyal) in 1558, \"Muy Noble y Leal Ciudad\" (Very Noble and Loyal City) in 1561 and \"Muy Noble y Muy Leal Ciudad\" (Very Noble and Very Loyal City) in 1576.\n\nThe layout of the city is of classic Spanish design, centered on a main plaza, today called the Zócalo. This main plaza originally was rectangular, but later made square because the earlier version was considered to be ugly. Another major feature of the city were the weekly markets (tianguis), in which indigenous sellers would come with their wares and foodstuffs to sell to the population. By the mid-16th century, water was brought in to the main plaza to a newly installed fountain. By the end of the century, the city occupied 120 blocks, much of which was under construction, with the new Cathedral begun in 1575. Its favorable climate and strategic location helped the city to prosper, quickly becoming the second most important city in New Spain. Juan Gutiérrez de Padilla, the preeminent 17th-century composer in the New World, spent most of his life at the Cathedral, from about 1620 to 1664.\n\nThe city council of Puebla, being made up of only Spaniards, had a certain amount of autonomy in the politics of the city and the land under its jurisdiction. This council annexed the towns of Amozoc, Totimehuacán, and Cuautinchán to its territory in 1755. By 1786, Puebla’s lands reached from what is now Veracruz to Guerrero states. The city continued to grow and be more regulated during the 17th and 18th centuries. A new city hall was built in 1714 and the tianguis in the main plaza was replaced by wood stalls by the 1770s. The streets were paved with stone between 1786 and 1811.\n\nCommercial activity was dislodged from the main plaza completely by the early 19th century and placed in the San Francisco Parian market. Other plazas, such as the San Luis, San Antonio, El Carmen, La Concordia and Santa Inés were built. The main plaza underwent several transformations, adding statues and gardens. During the Mexican War of Independence, Puebla’s main role was the printing and distribution of the plan for independence. In 1827, after Independence, all Spaniards (\"peninsulares\") were expelled from the city’s lands.\n\nIn 1847, the city was taken by U.S. forces under General Winfield Scott, without a shot fired. The American garrison was besieged in the city from 14 September – 12 October 1847 by the irregular forces of General Joaquín Rea and later reinforced by Antonio López de Santa Anna. The siege was broken by the force of General Joseph Lane that fought its way from Veracruz into the city after defeating Santa Ana in the Battle of Huamantla on 9 October 1847. Puebla was then the base for General Lane's campaign against General Rea and the other guerrillas that harassed the U. S. Army line of communications. These forces left in July 1848 after the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was ratified.\n\nDuring the French intervention in Mexico on 5 May 1862 in the Battle of Puebla, defending Mexican forces under Ignacio Zaragoza defeated the French army under Count de Lorencez, which was considered to be the most powerful in the world at the time. The city’s name was changed to Puebla de Zaragoza in 1862, by a decree issued by Benito Juárez and the holiday \"5 de Mayo\" (Cinco de Mayo) is a major annual event here. The city was attacked again by the French in 1863, who succeeded in taking it. French forces left in 1866 and reconstruction began in 1867.\n\nDuring the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Puebla remained important culturally and economically. It had a thriving textile industry at this time. Immigration from Europe was encouraged and people from Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Lebanon came to live in the city.\n\nIn what became a precursor to the Mexican Revolution, siblings Carmen, Máximo y Aquiles Serdán were behind one of the first conspiracies against the Porfirio Diaz government. Their plans were discovered and their house, located on 6 Oriente street was surrounded by federal troops. A gun battle ensued, killing both Serdán brothers on 18 November 1910. During the Mexican Revolution, the city was taken by forces under General Pablo Gonzalez Garza, then later was under Zapatista control.\n\nFrom 1931 until the end of the 20th century, growth of the city spurred the absorption of the municipalities of Ignacio Mariscal, San Felipe Hueyotlipan, Resurreccion, San Jeronimo Caleras, San Miguel Canoa and San Francisco Totimehuacán into the city. In 1950, by decree of the state congress, the city received the title of Heroica Puebla de Zaragoza. In 1977, the federal government declared the city a Zone of Historical Monuments. In 1987, the historic center of Puebla was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nThe City of Puebla submitted its candidacy to hold the headquarters of the Free Trade Area of the Americas, and briefly served as interim secretariat headquarters until negotiations were stopped in 2005.\n\nThe municipality is located in the west-central region of the State of Puebla, bordering the municipalities of Santo Domingo Huehutlán, San Andrés Cholula, Teopantlán, Amozoc, Cuauthinchán, Tzicatlacoyan, Cuautlancingo, and Ocoyucan, and the State of Tlaxcala.\n\nAs municipal seat, the city of Puebla is the government for 482 other communities with a total area of 534.32km2. However, 94% of the municipality’s population of 1,485,941 lives in the city proper.\n\nMost of the municipality has been deforested, including the lower portions of the Malinche volcano and all the Sierra de Amozoc, due to logging and seasonal farming.\n\nThe Sierra del Tentzon and higher elevations of Malinche volcano still conserve the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests ecoregion – with forests of pine, holm oak and other tree species. In the pine forests, Montezuma Pine \"(Pinus montezumae)\" is generally predominant, with Hartweg's Pine \"(Pinus hartwegii)\" and \"Pinus teocote\" in dry areas with shallow soils. Pine-fir forests are composed almost entirely of Hartweg's Pine \"(Pinus hartwegii)\" and Sacred Fir \"(Abies religiosa)\".\n\nAnimal life consists mostly of small mammals such as rabbits and skunks, as well as birds such as owls, buzzards and wild waterfowl.\n\nSome agriculture still takes place in the municipality but environmental degradation and the growth of the city is making this a smaller sector of the economy. Crops raised include corn, beans, wheat, oats, avocados, pears, apples, peaches, choke cherries, Mexican hawthorns, nuts and white sapotes. Most agriculture takes place on small plots on the edges of the municipality. Similarly livestock such as cattle, pigs, sheep and horses are raised.\n\nIndustry accounts for about eighty percent of the economy and is mostly based in the outskirts of the city as well as in some surrounding municipalities. Main products include basic metals, chemicals, electrical items and textiles. The main employers are Hylsa and the Volkswagen automotive plant. A growing sector is food processing. Many industries are consolidated into parks such as the 5 de Mayo Industrial Park, the Resurrección Industrial Zone and the Puebla 2000 Industrial Park.\n\nShopping centers include the Angelópolis Lifestyle Center and Parque Puebla.\n\nPuebla is located at the Valley of Puebla also known as the Valley of Cuetlaxcoapan, a large valley surrounded on four sides by the mountains and volcanoes of the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt. It is located east of the Popocatépetl and Iztaccíhuatl volcanoes, giving residents views of their snow-topped peaks. Due to the proximity to the Popocatépetl, Puebla is some times exposed to the ash and dust that emanate from the volcano during its active periods, the most recent occurring on 8 May 2013.\n\nLa Malinche dormant volcano is located to the north of the city, and the Pico de Orizaba to the east. Hydrologically, the city is part of the Atoyac river basin; the river runs through northern, eastern and southern portions of the municipality, and connects to the Lake of Valsequillo, where the Manuel Ávila Camacho dam has been built. Other rivers that cross the area are the Alseseca and San Francisco.\n\nUnder the Köppen climate classification (Köppen: Cwb), Puebla features a Subtropical highland climate. The climate is moderated by its high altitude of . As a result, it rarely gets truly hot in Puebla, with an average of only three days seeing temperatures rise above . Night temperatures are cool at all times of the year. Puebla experiences a dry season from November through April and a rainy season from May–October. The valley has a temperate climate while the higher elevations have cold climates. Most rain falls in the summer and early fall.\n\nThe historical and cultural value of Puebla's architecture is a major reason the city was chosen as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Various styles and techniques such as Baroque, Renaissance and Classic are represented here in over 5,000 buildings included in the catalogue. The historic center is filled with churches, monasteries, mansions and the like, mostly done in gray cantera stone, red brick and decorated with multicolored tiles. Puebla is also considered to be the \"cradle of Mexican Baroque\" both in architecture and in the decorative arts, and one of the five most important colonial cities in Mexico.\n\nIn spite of the many shopping malls that exist in Puebla today, the Zócalo, the main square, remains the cultural, political and religious center of the city. It was the first block to be laid out, with the rest of the historic center traced out from it in the form of a checkerboard. This main plaza originally was rectangular, but later made square because the earlier version was considered to be ugly. Until the end of the 18th century, this was the main market for the town. For much of the colonial period, it was the main source of potable water via a fountain that had been installed in the center in the mid-16th century. Many political and cultural events have been and continue to be held here. Bullfights were held in the main square from 1566 to 1722. Today, the Zocalo is a tree-filled plaza and contains a large number of sculptures, but the most noted is the one of the Archangel Michael that is in a fountain placed in the center in 1777. Many notable buildings surround the Zocalo including City Hall, the Casa de los Muñecos and the Cathedral. Most of the streets in Puebla are named on a numbering system, which centers on the northwest corner of the Zocalo. El Parian is an arts and crafts market, within walking distance of the plaza. It consists mostly of permanent stalls but there is an area provided for vendors who visit and sell their wares on blankets spread on the ground.\n\nThe Amparo Museum is housed in two colonial-era buildings from the 17th and 18th centuries that were popularly known as El Hospitalito. One was the Hospital of San Juan de Letrán, which was converted into a college for women. The other is a mansion from the 18th century. It was joined to the hospital and then became the \"Deposito de Mujeres Casadas\" (Refuge of Married Women) This was established in 1606 for women whose husbands were gone for long periods of time. However, the idea was not popular with women and in 1609, it became the asylum for \"lost women,\" those obligated to be secluded for some reason. This facility was moved to another building and the building became part of the women’s college founded next door, then a convent. The museum has fourteen exhibition halls with pottery, steles and sculptures from the Zapotec, Huasteca, Maya, Olmec and Aztec cultures as well as fine furniture and religious objects from the colonial period and examples of contemporary art. These represent the three epochs of Mexican history, pre-Columbian, colonial-era and post-Independence. Seven of the halls are dedicated to pre-Columbian pieces.\n\nThe Biblioteca Palafoxiana (Palafoxiana Library) was established in 1646 by Juan de Palafox y Mendoza for the Seminary of Puebla. He donated his own collection of 5,000 books to the College of San Juan to start the collection. It was the first library in the Americas and is the only one to survive to the present day. The main room is in Baroque style and was constructed in 1773 by Bishop Francisco Fabian y Fuero who also named the institution after Palafox. Today the library contains over 42,000 books, 5,000 manuscripts and other items, which date from 1473 to 1910. The Library was named a Historic Monument of Mexico (Monumento Histórico de México) and UNESCO has made it part of Memory of the World.\n\nThe Centro Cultural Santa Rosa is housed in a building that dates from the 17th century which originally was housing for Dominican nuns. Later, it became a convent named in honour of Saint Rose of Lima. This is where the story of the invention of mole poblano takes place. In 1869, it ceased being a convent and became a psychiatric hospital. In the 20th century the Ceramic Museum was founded in the building’s kitchen, with the rest of the building occupied as tenements for about 1500 people. In 1973, the Museo de Arte Cultural Poblano was founded and in 2000 the name was changed to the current one. The facility offers exhibitions, shows and art classes.\n\nThe Museo de la Revolución (Museum of the Revolution) was the home of Aquiles Serdán in the very early 20th century. He was politically active in the anti-reelection (of President Porfirio Diaz) movement of the time and was accused of distributing propaganda against Díaz. Police assaulted the building and Serdán and his family fought back, until Aquiles was killed. President Francisco I. Madero stayed at the home in honor of Serdán. Shortly thereafter, the family moved to Mexico City and the building became tenements and stores. Decades later, the federal government acquired the building from the family to convert it into the museum that is here today.\nFort Loreto and Fort Guadalupe are located in the Centro Civico 5 de Mayo part of the city. Both were instrumental to the Battle of Puebla on 5 May 1862. The chapel of the Loreto fort contains a former chapel, which is now the Museo de la No Intervención (Museum of Non-Intervention). This is to commemorate a non-aggression pact signed by Mexico and Central American and two South American countries in the 1960s. The Museo de Guerra del Fuerte (Fort War Museum) de Loreto y Guadalupe is located in this fort as well. This museum contains cannons, shotguns, swords, documents and other objects related to this battle.\n\nThe Galería de Arte Contemporáneo y Diseño (Gallery of Contemporary Art and Design) is dedicated to visual arts such as painting, sculpture, ceramics, metal etching, photography, video, and others and belongs to the Secretary of Culture of the state of Puebla. It is housed in the old La Violeta textile factory, which dates back to 1908, and was one only many factories in this area at that time. This building was renovated between 1995 and 1998 for this museum.\n\nThe International Museum of the Baroque is a museum of Baroque art designed by Japanese architect Toyoo Itō. It opened on February 4, 2016.\n\nThe Museo de José Mariano Bello y Acedo (José Mariano Bello y Acedo Museum) was initially founded with the private collection of the Bello family, along with works donated by friends. It originally began as a private museum or pinacotheca. Upon José Mariano's death, the house and collection was bequeathed to the city.\nThe Casa de Alfeñique is named for the intricate mortar work that covers its façade. Alfeñique is a kind of sugar and almond candy. It was constructed by Antonio Santamaría de Incháurregui for Juan Ignacio Morales, who was a master ironsmith. The façades also contain ironwork balconies, cornices and a crown. The house was left to the state by Alejandro Ruiz Olavarrieta in 1896. It was first used to house the first public museum in the city of Puebla. The collection contains more than 1,500 pieces of a historical nature.\n\nThe Museo de Arte (Museum of Art) originally was constructed to be the Temple of San Pedro, founded in 1541 to be a church and a hospital. Eventually it was established as the Hospital of San Pedro y San Pablo under the direction of the Cathedral of Tlaxcala. It was functioning as a hospital by 1544, but it incurred major expenditures, forcing it to limit service to men only. The arches of the main courtyard were completed in 1640, as well as it fountain and nursing units. In the first half of the 18th century, the hospital ceased to be under the direct control of the Cathedral, passing to the monks of the order of San Juan de Dios. In the latter half of the century, it began to house soldiers in order to improve its finances. The hospital underwent major reforms in the early 19th century to improve medical care, and began to receive medical students from the Medical-Surgical Academy of Puebla. In 1867, the facility became the Hospital General del Estado. In 1917, the hospital moved to new facilities in the city. Through most of the 20th century, the building was used for a wide-variety of purposes. In 1998, a project to restore the building for its use as Puebla Museum of Viceregal Art. In 2002, this museum was converted into the San Pedro Museum of Art, which exhibits works from various epochs.\n\nThe Museum Workshop of Erasto Cortés Juárez was the home of one of the major figures in fine and graphic arts in Puebla in the 20th century. The museum was founded in 2000 and contains more than 400 pieces of both his work and personal effects. The museum also hosts temporary exhibits, workshops and seminars.\n\nPuebla Cathedral, located on 16 de Septiembre and 5 Oriente, took 300 years to complete, in part due to interruptions in its construction. The Cathedral was begun in 1575 under orders of Philip II of Spain by architects Francisco Becerra and Juan de Cigorondo. The building was consecrated in 1649 even though only half of the walls and much of the roof were missing and the towers not yet built. The north tower was added in 1678 and the south tower in 1768.The shape of the cathedral is a Latin cross and contains five naves. The main altar is octagonal, with four others oriented to the cardinal directions The complex consists of fourteen chapels in various styles with numerous artistic works such as the main cupola and the main altar, both decorated by Cristóbal de Villalpando. The façade is classified as late Baroque in transition to Neoclassical, with Doric and Corinthian columns. Its bell towers stand at just under 70 meters high, the tallest in Mexico. The seating in the choir is made of parquetry of fine woods, onyx and ivory of Moorish design. The two organs were donated by Charles V. In the crypt under the Cathedral, numerous statues of saints and angels made of onyx can be seen.\n\nThe Church and Friary of San Francisco is on Blvd Heroes del 5 de Mayo. Its elevated four-level tower stands out with its mouldings and Ionic and Doric pilasters. The main façade is done in gray cantera stone in which are sculpted large jars and flowers. The main portal is of Churrigueresque style, flanked by large panels of tilework surrounded by Plateresque decoration. Inside is a Plateresque choir, Neoclassic altarpieces and the mummified body of the beatified, and soon to be canonized as a saint, Sebastian de Aparicio.\n\nThe large friary complex houses an active group of Franciscan friars, who in addition to running a large K-12 school on the site, also work in other pastoral, justice, peace, and environmental activities.\n\nThe Church of Santo Domingo is located on 5 de Mayo Street. The main portal is of pure classic style finished in gray cantera stone. It consists of three levels with paired Doric-like columns. The façade of the old monastery is highly decorated in Baroque style, in front of which is a large atrium. Inside the ceiling consists of two large vaults and contains gilded altarpieces in Baroque, Salmonic and Churrigueresque styles.\n\nThe Chapel of the Rosary is located in the Church of Santo Domingo. The Chapel was built between 1650 and 1690 and was the first to be dedicated to the Our Lady of the Rosary. The chapel is filled with symbolism, as it is filled with images and elements which are representative of the Baroque of New Spain. This symbolism is principally meant to aid with the evangelization process. The chapel contains three themes important to the Church, the mysteries of the rosary, the virtues associated with it and the Virgin of the Rosary herself. The cupola is in the shape of the crown of the Virgin Mary. The chapel is decorated with sculpted plaster that has been gilded done by local artists. There are also six paintings done by José Rodriguez Carnero as well as paintings by the altar depicting the life of the Virgin.\n\nThe Casa del Deán is the oldest noble house in the city of Puebla, constructed by Tomás de la Plaza Goes, who was the deacon of the Cathedral of Puebla. It was finished in 1580. The building remained practically intact until 1953, when it was going to be demolished to construct a movie theater. Protests to save the building, due to its murals and façade, succeeded. The murals are frescos, which are the only surviving non-religious examples from the 16th century in their original place in Mexico. The gray stone façade is completely smooth to let the main portal, of Renaissance style, stand out. The portal contains and upper and lower portion with a crest.\n\nThe Teatro Principal de Puebla (Main Theater of Puebla) was inaugurated in 1761 by Miguel de Santamaría. In 1902, the theater burned down, and was rebuilt in 1940, and again in 1998. The theater hosts cultural events and art shows featuring regional, national and international artists.\n\nThe Municipal Palace is located on Maximino Avila Camacho. The façade is made of gray cantera stone in Renaissance style, using Ionic columns and pediments, differing from the other buildings that border the main plaza. The portal has two levels topped by a central garret, in which there is a clock and towers on each side.\n\nThe Fountain of the China Poblana is located on Blvd Heroes de 5 de May. It is a monumental work done in cantera stone and Talavera tile, with a base of about thirty meters in diameter. In the center is a column that supports two large bowls and a sculpture of the China Pobalana which is over three meters high.\n\nCuexcomate is a geyser cone thirteen meters tall with a diameter of 23 meters. The geyser is inactive and located in the La Libertad neighborhood of the city of Puebla. There is a spiral staircase going down into the crater itself.\n\nThe best-known mole is named after the city of Puebla, mole poblano. The origin of this sauce is disputed and there are two versions of the legend that are most often cited. The first states that 16th century nuns from the Convent of Santa Rosa were worried because they had just found out that the archbishop was going to visit them and they had nothing to prepare for him except for an old turkey in the yard. Supposedly due to divine inspiration, they began to mix together many of the spices and flavorings they had on hand in the kitchen, including different types of chili peppers, other spices, day-old bread, chocolate and approximately twenty other ingredients. They let the sauce simmer for hours and poured it over the turkey meat. Fortunately, the archbishop was very pleased with the meal and the nuns were able to save face.\n\nThe other story states that the sauce is of pre-Hispanic times and this was served to Hernán Cortés and the other conquistadors by Moctezuma II. The Aztecs did have a preparation called \"chilmulli\", which in Nahuatl means \"chili pepper sauce\". However, there is no evidence that chocolate was ever used to flavor prepared foods or used in chilmulli. What has happened is that the sauce gained ingredients as it was reinterpreted over the colonial period.\nMany food writers and gourmets nowadays consider one particular dish, the famous turkey in mole poblano, which contains chocolate, to represent the pinnacle of the Mexican cooking tradition.\n\nAnother famous dish, chiles en nogada, was also supposedly invented here. The story begins with three sisters from Puebla who met officers from Agustin de Iturbide's Army of the Three Guarantees in Mexico City and fell in love with them. Attempts were made to engage the couples but one problem was that none of the sisters knew how to cook. Upon returning to Puebla, their mother sent them to the Convent of Santa Monica to learn. The women decided they wanted to make an original dish to impress Iturbide and his officers when they were due to visit Puebla. The dish, chiles en nogada, represents the colors of the Mexican flag, green (parsley), white (the walnut sauce) and red (pomegranate seeds). The dish was served for the first time at a banquet for Iturbide with great success.\n\nAnother signature dish in Puebla is the \"cemita\", which is a type of well-stuffed sandwich on a bun. The cemita is considered to be \"the sister of the Mexican torta, the first cousin of the pambazo, the distant cousin of the paste and the sandwich and the precursor to the giant tortas\" that are now sold in most parts of Mexico today. This large, meaty sandwich is named after the bread on which it is served, a cemita. This bread is based on a bread introduced by the French during the period of the French Intervention in Mexico (1863–1867), but since then has evolved to suit Mexican tastes, especially in Puebla state. In the early 20th century, the bread began to be served sliced with a filling of leftovers, generally potatoes, beans, nopal, beef, chicken or pork. The Victoria Market in Puebla became famous for a version with beef hoof, onions and chili peppers with a vinaigrette sauce. Other markets and food stands soon created their own versions of the cemita with just about any kind of filling combination possible. During the same time period, it became traditional to sprinkle sesame seeds onto the cemita bread, often with designs of flowers, stars, animals and other things. While the dish started out as a lower-class meal, it is now enjoyed by people of all social classes in the city as a form of fast-food.\n\nSoon after its foundation, Puebla was well known for its fine ceramics, especially for the style that would be called Talavera. This has been due to the abundance of quality clay in the region, drawing some of the best artisans. Between 1550 and 1570, Spanish potters from Talavera de la Reina in Spain came to Puebla to teach the locals European techniques of using the potter’s wheel and tin-glazing. These new methods were mixed with native designs to give rise to what became known as Poblano Talavera. The glazing technique was first used for the tiles that still decorate many of the buildings in this city. Later, it was used to make pots, plates, jars, religious figures and other items. By the mid-17th century, the industry here had become well-established. Guilds were formed and ordinances passed to ensure quality. Blue was used only on the most expensive pieces due to the cost of the mineral used to produce it. The period between 1650 and 1750 was known as the Golden Age.\n\nIn 1813, the constitution eradicated the potter's guild and revoked the ordinances established in 1653 to standardize production. Now anybody could use this ceramic method in any style they wanted, and the lack of regulations led to a decline in technique and artistic quality. The Talavera market crashed. Out of the 46 workshops in production since the 18th century, only seven remained. When Enrique Luis Ventosa, a 29-year-old Catalan, arrived in Puebla in 1897, there were just six workshops left. Ventosa was fascinated by the history and fine craft work that had distinguished Puebla from the rest of Mexico. He became the leading force behind a renaissance in Talavera ware.\n\nAnother impetus to the rebirth of Puebla tile was that collectors found out about it. In 1904 an American named Emily Johnston de Forest traveled to Mexico with her husband and discovered Talavera. She established contact with scholars, collectors, and dealers who assisted her in building her collection. Eventually her collection was given to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Other museums, like the Philadelphia Museum of Art, built their own collections. The Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City has the largest collection of 726 pieces.\n\nAccording to legend, a young Indian woman named Mirra was kidnapped by Portuguese pirates and taken to Cochin (modern-day Kochi), in the south of India. There, she escaped her kidnappers and took refuge in a Jesuit mission, where she was baptized with the name \"Catarina de San Juan\". Mirra was again kidnapped by the same pirates that had taken her from her birth parents, and in Manila they delivered her to the merchant who later took her to New Spain. Once in Acapulco, she was sold to a Puebla merchant by the name of Miguel de Sosa. Through her life, Catarina or Mirra continued to dress in a sari. It is possible that is this gave rise to the \"china dress\" that became popular in Mexico in the 17th century. A few years after her arrival in Mexico, Miguel de Sosa died, providing in his will for the manumission of his slave. She was taken in by a convent, where it is said she began to have visions of the Virgin Mary and Baby Jesus. The \"China Poblana\" died on 5 January 1688 at the age of 82. In Puebla, she was venerated as a saint until 1691, when the Mexican Inquisition prohibited open devotion to her. Today, the Templo de la Compañía, in Puebla, is known as \"La Tumba de la China Poblana\" because in its sacristy lie the remains of Catarina de San Juan.\n\nThere have long been rumours of a system of tunnels under the city. Long considered to be an urban legend, they were rediscovered in 2015. They are believed to be up to 500 years old.\n\nEvery year on 5 May, Puebla celebrates the defeat of invading French troops here in 1862. Celebrations include several days of concerts, lectures, other cultural activities. On the 5th itself, there is a very large parade and a re-enactment of the battle. The parade includes Mexican Army, Navy, Special Forces and soldiers dressed in period uniform. The military displays tanks, Humvees and armored personnel carriers. Civilian participation includes school bands, students and floats, both from Mexico and from abroad.\n\nPuebla City has many universities, second in the country only after Mexico City. The main university of the city is the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP), the oldest and largest university in the region, founded on 15 April 1587. Other public university is the Instituto Tecnológico de Puebla. The city is also home for one of the most prestigious private universities in Mexico and Latin America, Tecnologico de Monterrey, Universidad Iberoamericana and the Universidad de las Americas Puebla (UDLAP).\n\nPuebla has two professional football teams, \"Puebla F.C.\" and \"Lobos de la BUAP\". The biggest football stadium in the city, \"Cuauhtémoc\", with a capacity of 51,720, was built in 1968 as a second football field for the 1968 Olympic Games. Matches for the 1970 and 1986 FIFA World Cups were also played in Cuauhtémoc Stadium. In 2015 it was intervened to make it up to new Fifa standards which commodity, modernism and outside visual image have changed for the better. With a capacity of 51,720 it is the 4th biggest stadium in México just behind Jalisco Stadium and with 45.9 meters tall it is also the highest stadium from parking level to the highest most part of the roof beating the second tallest Aztec stadium by 4 meters.\n\nPuebla has a professional baseball team, the \"Pericos de Puebla\".\nPuebla, through the conurbated area of Cholula, has one college American football team, the \"Aztecas\" of the Universidad de las Américas. The Aztecas have won the championship three times since the creation of the Mexican College Football Organization (ONEFA) in 1978 (1995, 1996, and 1997). The team has been runner's up in the league 5 times, most recently in 2006 and 2007, losing the championship game all five times to the ITESM Campus Monterrey Borregos Salvajes. The Azteca's home stadium is the \"Templo del Dolor\" (Temple of Pain).\n\nPuebla is served by Puebla International Airport, which is part of the metropolitan airport group for the Mexican capital and an alternate airport for Mexico City. It provides domestic services and flights to the United States. The airport is also used as a place to manufacture goods and export and import due to prime location.\n\nIn January 2013 the first line of the bus rapid transit system named RUTA was open to the public from Chachapa to Tlaxcalanzingo, in April 2014 the second line was open that goes on 11 Norte-Sur from Diagonal Defensores de la República to Calle Limones. Also, an eleven-mile light rail system was inaugurated in January 2017 connecting Puebla with Cholula in the western end of the city.\n\n\nPuebla is twinned with:\n\n"}
{"id": "28886283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28886283", "title": "Railroad brotherhoods", "text": "Railroad brotherhoods\n\nThe Railroad brotherhoods are labor unions of railroad workers in the United States. They first appeared in 1863 and they are still active. Until recent years they were largely independent of each other and of the American Federation of Labor.\n\nWith the rapid growth and consolidation of large railroad systems after 1870, union organizations sprang up, covering the entire nation. By 1901, 17 major railway brotherhood were in operation; they generally worked amicably with management, which recognize their usefulness. Key unions included the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE), the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen. Their main goal was building insurance and medical packages for their members, and negotiating bureaucratic work rules that favored their membership, such as seniority and grievance procedures. They were not members of the AFL, and fought off more radical rivals such as the Knights of Labor in the 1880s and the American Railroad Union in the 1890s. They consolidated their power in 1916, after threatening a national strike, by securing the Adamson Act, a federal law that provided 10 hours' pay for an eight-hour day.\n\nAt the end World War I, the brotherhoods promoted the \"Plumb Plan\" for the nationalization of the railroads, and conducted a national strike in 1919. Both efforts failed, and the brotherhoods were largely stagnant in the 1920s. They generally were independent politically, but supported the third-party campaign of Robert M. La Follette Sr. in 1924. \n\nThe Republican Party was dominant in Washington and it was generally hostile to the brotherhoods until it moderated its position around 1926.\n\nThe Great Railroad Strike of 1922, a nationwide railroad shop workers' strike, began on July 1. The immediate cause of the strike was the Railroad Labor Board's announcement that hourly wages would be cut by seven cents on July 1, which prompted a shop workers' vote on whether or not to strike. The operators' union did not join in the strike, and the railroads employed strikebreakers to fill three-fourths of the roughly 400,000 vacated positions, increasing hostilities between the railroads and the striking workers. On September 1, a federal judge issued a sweeping injunction against striking, assembling, picketing, colloquially known as the \"Daugherty injunction\".\n\nUnions bitterly resented the injunction; a few sympathy strikes shut down some railroads completely. The strike eventually died out as many shopmen made deals with the railroads on the local level. The often unpalatable concessions—coupled with memories of the violence and tension during the strike—soured relations between the railroads and the shopmen for years.\n\n\n"}

He also presented eight episodes of \"Time Team Extra\" in 1998.\n\nBush was born in Hayes, Middlesex. His father was originally a schoolmaster and then a training college lecturer in Mathematics. Bush attended Exeter School in Devon between 1950 and 1962, and it was here aged 13 that he first became interested in historical research while studying the school's history. His first two research papers were published by the Devonshire Association before he left school. He won a Trevelyan Scholarship, followed by a Stapledon Exhibition and later still a State Scholarship, to read History at Exeter College, Oxford (1962–65), taking his BA in Modern History in 1965 and an MA in 1984. Among his contemporaries at Oxford were the poet Craig Raine, the journalist Tariq Ali, the Marquess of Hartington and the psephologist Professor Ivor Crewe. A keen amateur actor, he also appeared on stage at the Oxford Playhouse with Monty Python actor Terry Jones.\n\nIn 1965 he was appointed assistant archivist at Surrey Record Office at Kingston upon Thames before moving to Somerset Record Office in 1967 where he spent the rest of his working life. From 1970 to 1978 Bush was assistant editor of the \"Somerset Victoria County History\", writing much of the content of three of its volumes. Later he returned to the Record Office as Deputy County Archivist until taking early retirement in 1993.\n\nBush wrote his first book in 1977, and produced volumes on the history of Taunton, Exmouth and Wellington, followed by a series of books on the county of Somerset. He researched emigration from the South West of England to New England between 1620 and 1645, which led to the publication of three further books in Ohio. Bush made six speaking tours to the United States, during one of which he met President George H. W. Bush at the White House. In 1987 he explained Somerset's archives to HM the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. From 1984 to 1996 he had a weekly spot on BBC Radio Bristol and then BBC Somerset, on which he told stories of local history and folklore.\n\nBush became involved with the \"Time Team\" programmes through his long friendship with Mick Aston when Aston was Somerset's first county field archaeologist. Aston had previously discussed the idea of devising an archaeological television programme with Tony Robinson, and a pilot episode was set up. Through helping to devise the programme's format with producer Tim Taylor, Bush was invited to take part in the pilot which was shot at Dorchester-on-Thames in October 1992. Although the pilot programme was never screened, the idea was good enough to persuade Channel 4 to commission a four programme series of \"Time Team\", which was filmed in 1993 and broadcast the following year.\n\nBush also appeared in Channel 4's series \"Joe Public\", for which he researched the loss of a hat jewel by Henry VIII.

From 1715 to 1718 the \"Polysynody\" changed the system of government in France, in which each minister (secretary of state) was replaced by a council. The \"système de Law\" was also introduced, which transformed the finances of the bankrupted kingdom and its aristocracy. Both Cardinal Dubois and Cardinal Fleury were highly influential during this time.\n\nContemporary European rulers included Philip V of Spain, John V of Portugal, George I of Great Britain, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor and Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, the maternal grandfather of Louis XV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were seven parts of the Polysynody all of which had their own ministers for the Regency:\n\n\nThe Men\n\n\nThe Women\n\n\n\nThe Régence marks the temporary eclipse of Versailles as centre of policymaking, since the Regent's court was at the Palais Royal in Paris. It marks the rise of Parisian salons as cultural centres, as literary meeting places and nuclei of discreet liberal resistance to some official policies. In the Paris salons aristocrats mingled more easily with the \"higher Bourgeoisie\" in a new atmosphere of relaxed decorum, comfort and intimacy.\n\nIn the arts, the style of the Régence is marked by early Rococo, characterised by the paintings of Antoine Watteau (1684–1721).\n\nRococo developed first in the decorative arts and interior design. Louis XIV's succession brought a change in the court artists and general artistic fashion. By the end of the old king's reign, rich Baroque designs were giving way to lighter elements with more curves and natural patterns. These elements are obvious in the architectural designs of Nicolas Pineau. During the Régence, court life moved away from Versailles and this artistic change became well established, first in the royal palace and then throughout French high society. The delicacy and playfulness of Rococo designs is often seen as perfectly in tune with the excesses of Louis XV's regime.\n\nThe 1730s represented the height of Rococo development in France. The style had spread beyond architecture and furniture to painting and sculpture, exemplified by the works of Antoine Watteau and François Boucher. Rococo still maintained the Baroque taste for complex forms and intricate patterns, but by this point, it had begun to integrate a variety of diverse characteristics, including a taste for Oriental designs and asymmetric compositions.\n\nThe \"Régence\" is also the customary French word for the pre-independence regimes in the western North African countries, the so-called Barbary Coast. It was applied to:\n\nFrench colonial expansion was not limited to the New World, however. In Senegal in West Africa, the French began to establish trading posts along the coast in 1624. In 1664, the French East India Company was established to compete for trade in the east. Colonies were established in India in Chandernagore (1673) and Pondichéry in the south east (1674), and later at Yanam (1723), Mahé (1725), and Karikal (1739) (see French India). Colonies were also founded in the Indian Ocean, on the Île de Bourbon (Réunion, 1664), Isle de France (now Mauritius, 1718), and the Seychelles (1756).\n\n"}

It belongs to the broader field of space geodesy. Traditional astronomical geodesy is \"not\" commonly considered a part of satellite geodesy, although there is considerable overlap between the techniques.\n\nThe main goals of satellite geodesy are:\n\nSatellite geodetic data and methods can be applied to diverse fields such as navigation, hydrography, oceanography and geophysics. Satellite geodesy relies heavily on orbital mechanics.\n\nSatellite geodesy began shortly after the launch of Sputnik in 1957. Observations of Explorer 1 and Sputnik 2 in 1958 allowed for an accurate determination of Earth's flattening. The 1960s saw the launch of the Doppler satellite Transit-1B and the balloon satellites Echo 1, Echo 2, and PAGEOS. The first dedicated geodetic satellite was ANNA-1B, a collaborative effort between NASA, the DoD, and other civilian agencies. ANNA-1B carried the first of the US Army's SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) instruments. These missions led to the accurate determination of the leading spherical harmonic coefficients of the geopotential, the general shape of the geoid, and linked the world's geodetic datums.\n\nSoviet military satellites undertook geodesic missions to assist in ICBM targeting in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nThe Transit satellite system was used extensively for Doppler surveying, navigation, and positioning. Observations of satellites in the 1970s by worldwide triangulation networks allowed for the establishment of the World Geodetic System. The development of GPS by the United States in the 1980s allowed for precise navigation and positioning and soon became a standard tool in surveying. In the 1980s and 1990s satellite geodesy began to be used for monitoring of geodynamic phenomena, such as crustal motion, Earth rotation, and polar motion.\n\nThe 1990s were focused on the development of permanent geodetic networks and reference frames. Dedicated satellites were launched to measure Earth's gravity field in the 2000s, such as CHAMP, GRACE, and GOCE.\n\nTechniques of satellite geodesy may be classified by instrument platform: A satellite may\n\nGlobal navigation satellite systems are dedicated radio positioning services, which can locate a receiver to within a few meters. The most prominent system, GPS, consists of a constellation of 31 satellites (as of December 2013) in high, 12-hour circular orbits, distributed in six planes with 55° inclinations. The principle of location is based on trilateration. Each satellite transmits a precise ephemeris with information on its own position and a message containing the exact time of transmission. The receiver compares this time of transmission with its own clock at the time of reception and multiplies the difference by the speed of light to obtain a \"pseudorange.\" Four pseudoranges are needed to obtain the precise time and the receiver's position within a few meters. More sophisticated methods, such as real-time kinematic (RTK) can yield positions to within a few millimeters.\n\nIn geodesy, GNSS is used as an economical tool for surveying and time transfer. It is also used for monitoring Earth's rotation, polar motion, and crustal dynamics. The presence of the GPS signal in space also makes it suitable for orbit determination and satellite-to-satellite tracking.\n\nIn satellite laser ranging (SLR) a global network of observation stations measure the round trip time of flight of ultrashort pulses of light to satellites equipped with retroreflectors. This provides instantaneous range measurements of millimeter level precision which can be accumulated to provide accurate orbit parameters, gravity field parameters (from the orbit perturbations), Earth rotation parameters, tidal Earth's deformations, coordinates and velocities of SLR stations, and other substantial geodetic data. Satellite laser ranging is a proven geodetic technique with significant potential for important contributions to scientific studies of the Earth/Atmosphere/Oceans system. It is the most accurate technique currently available to determine the geocentric position of an Earth satellite, allowing for the precise calibration of radar altimeters and separation of long-term instrumentation drift from secular changes in ocean surface topography.\nSatellite laser ranging contributes to the definition of the international terrestrial reference frames by providing the information about the scale and the origin of the reference frame, the so-called geocenter coordinates.\n\nDoppler positioning involves recording the Doppler shift of a radio signal of stable frequency emitted from a satellite as the satellite approaches and recedes from the observer. The observed frequency depends on the radial velocity of the satellite relative to the observer, which is constrained by orbital mechanics. If the observer knows the orbit of the satellite, then the recording the Doppler profile determines the observer's position. Conversely, if the observer's position is precisely known, then the orbit of the satellite can be determined and used to study the Earth's gravity. In DORIS, the ground station emits the signal and the satellite receives.\n\nIn optical tracking, the satellite can be used as a very high target for triangulation and can be used to ascertain the geometric relationship between multiple observing stations. Optical tracking with the BC-4, PC-1000, MOTS, or Baker Nunn cameras consisted of photographic observations of a satellite, or flashing light on the satellite, against a background of stars. The stars, whose positions were accurately determined, provided a framework on the photographic plate or film for a determination of precise directions from camera station to satellite. Geodetic positioning work with cameras was usually performed with one camera observing simultaneously with one or more other cameras. Camera systems are weather dependent and that is one major reason why they fell out of use by the 1980s.\n\nSatellites such as Seasat (1978) and TOPEX/Poseidon (1992-2006) used advanced dual-band radar altimeters to measure the height of the Earth's surface (sea, ice, and terrestrial surfaces) from a spacecraft. Jason-1 has begun in 2001, Jason-2 in 2008 and Jason-3 in January 2016. \nThat measurement, coupled with orbital elements (possibly augmented by GPS), enables determination of the terrain. The two different wavelengths of radio waves used permit the altimeter to automatically correct for varying delays in the ionosphere.\n\nSpaceborne radar altimeters have proven to be superb tools for mapping ocean-surface topography, the hills and valleys of the sea surface. These instruments send a microwave pulse to the ocean's surface and record the time it takes to return. A microwave radiometer corrects any delay that may be caused by water vapor in the atmosphere. Other corrections are also required to account for the influence of electrons in the ionosphere and the dry air mass of the atmosphere. Combining these data with the precise location of the spacecraft makes it possible to determine sea-surface height to within a few centimeters (about one inch). The strength and shape of the returning signal also provides information on wind speed and the height of ocean waves. These data are used in ocean models to calculate the speed and direction of ocean currents and the amount and location of heat stored in the ocean, which in turn reveals global climate variations.\n\nA radar altimeter uses the round-trip flight-time of a microwave pulse between the satellite and the Earth's surface to determine the distance between the spacecraft and the surface. From this distance or height, the local surface effects such as tides, winds and currents are removed to obtain the satellite height above the geoid. With a precise ephemeris available for the satellite, the geocentric position and ellipsoidal height of the satellite are available for any given observation time. It is then possible to compute the geoid height by subtracting the measured altitude from the ellipsoidal height. This allows direct measurement of the geoid, since the ocean surface closely follows the geoid. The difference between the ocean surface and the actual geoid gives ocean surface topography.\n\nA laser altimeter uses the round-trip flight-time of a beam of light at optical or infrared wavelengths to determine the spacecraft's altitude.\n\nInterferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a radar technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. This geodetic method uses two or more synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to generate maps of surface deformation or digital elevation, using differences in the phase of the waves returning to the satellite. The technique can potentially measure centimetre-scale changes in deformation over timespans of days to\nyears. It has applications for geophysical monitoring of natural hazards, for example earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also in structural engineering, in particular monitoring of subsidence and structural stability.\n\nA gravity gradiometer can independently determine the components of the gravity vector on a real-time basis. A gravity gradient is simply the spatial derivative of the gravity vector. The gradient can be thought of as the rate of change of a component of the gravity vector as measured over a small distance. Hence, the gradient can be measured by determining the difference in gravity at two close but distinct points. This principle is embodied in several recent moving-base instruments. The gravity gradient at a point is a tensor, since it is the derivative of each component of the gravity vector taken in each sensitive axis. Thus, the value of any component of the gravity vector can be known all along the path of the vehicle if gravity gradiometers are included in the system and their outputs are integrated by the system computer. An accurate gravity model will be computed in real-time and a continuous map of normal gravity, elevation, and anomalous gravity will be available.\n\nThis technique uses satellites to track other satellites. There are a number of variations which may be used for specific purposes such as gravity field investigations and orbit improvement.\n<br>These examples present a few of the possibilities for the application of satellite-to-satellite tracking. Satellite-to-satellite tracking data was first collected and analyzed in a high-low configuration between ATS-6 and GEOS-3. The data was studied to evaluate its potential for both orbit and gravitational model refinement.\n\n\n\n"}

It aired on Fox in the United States on March 18, 2018 with limited commercial interruption due to its runtime of 25 minutes, and is written by Gary Janetti and directed by Joe Vaux.\n\nThe episodes largely focuses on Stewie Griffin (voiced by creator Seth MacFarlane) about his major secrets, accompanied by a child psychologist (voiced by guest star Ian McKellen). None of the Griffin family appear except Brian at the very end, and no cutaway gags accompany the extended runtime. In addition, this episode was commercial-free so that Fox could promote the 2018 \"God of War\" video game.\n\nAt Quahog Preschool, Stewie is sent to the office of Dr. Cecil Pritchfield, a child psychologist. Stewie begins the therapy session by making observational small talk. He then starts to talk proudly about his British accent, but the psychologist says that he cannot hear it, much to Stewie's annoyance.\n\nWhen the doctor tells him he feels he knows him a bit after only a few minutes in his company, Stewie picks up a photograph of him on vacation with his husband Michael. Stewie begins to analyze their relationship in remarkable detail, revealing Pritchfield's embarrassment and insecurity about being much older than his husband. The psychologist then observes that Stewie is very lonely, at which Stewie suddenly bursts into tears, as Pritchfield's aide Barbara hands him some tissues.\n\nAfter Stewie regains composure, Pritchfield mentions the incident that brought Stewie to his office, in which he pushed a fellow classmate, Tyler, down the stairs. Stewie protests that he only did it because he liked Tyler and was afraid he would not like him back. Stewie denies being gay and declares that he is \"confident\" in his heterosexuality. He also expresses his difficulty fitting in when none of the other boys share his interests in musicals and world domination. He admits to pulling out his own hair because of anxiety, and expresses frustration at not being able to be on Broadway. He then performs to Pritchfield part of a number from the musical \"Hamilton\", while fighting hiccups and a runny nose.\n\nStewie takes up an offer of tea and Pritchfield begins to tell him of his own youth as an orphan in Britain during the Second World War. Stewie interrupts his long story and they return to discussing Stewie's differences and difficulty fitting in. Stewie admits that he has constructed a persona in order to hide his true self, and drops his British accent, revealing his true accent to have been American all along. He makes plans to reveal his true self to others as well, but reconsiders and reverts to his British accent when he faces being just like everyone else.\n\nPritchfield begins to have a heart attack. He asks Stewie to hand him his heart medication, but Stewie, aware that Pritchfield is the only one who has seen through his façade, lets him die, even as the doctor warns that if he does so, it will stay with him. Pritchfield calls out to Barbara, but Stewie points out that she has already gone to lunch. As he dies, the doctor picks up the photo of himself with his husband and recites lines from \"Romeo and Juliet\". Immediately after his death with Stewie still present, Pritchfield's office receives a voicemail from Michael demanding a divorce where Michael is unaware that Pritchfield is dead.\n\nLater that night, Stewie is plagued by guilt over his actions as Pritchfield had warned and asks Brian to sleep with him. He mentions that he has done something awful, though he does not explain further. Stewie lies awake while Brian falls asleep in his bed.\n\nThe episode was watched by 2.24 million viewers.\n"}

The painting includes a central picture (108 x 43 cm), currently at the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, and seven surrounding panels (measuring some 60 x 46 cm) which are exhibited at the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister of Dresden.\n\nThe work was commissioned by Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, not a long time after his meeting with Dürer at Nuremberg in April 1496. Stylistic considerations suggest that the artist started to work on the painting only from around 1500.\n\nModern scholars tend to attribute to Dürer only the central panel, the others having been executed by his pupils based on his drawings. The central panel, portraying the \"Sorrowing Mother\", arrived in the Bavarian museum from the \" Benediktbeuren\" convent of Munich in the early 19th century. It was restored in the 1930s: once the overpaintings and additions were removed, the shell-shaped niche (a motif typical of Italian art), the halo and the sword (a symbol of Mary of the Seven Sorrows) on the right were rediscovered, clarifying the subject of the work.\n\nThe other panels were at Wittenberg, seat of Frederick's castle.

It is a parish of the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau, a United member church of the Evangelical Church in Germany. It is notable for being the seat of the 1848 Frankfurt Parliament, the first publicly and freely-elected German legislative body. Although now a United Protestant church, it was started as a Lutheran church in 1789—coincidentally the same year as the French Revolution.\n\nThe Free City of Frankfurt, then governing its legally non-separated Lutheran state church, commissioned to construct the oval-shaped central church building in 1789. The new church building was to replace the former \"Church of the Discalced\" (Barfüßerkirche), which had been torn down in 1786 due to dilapidation. Constructions halted during the Napoleonic wars. The new building was completed between 1829 and 1833 by , whereupon the organ loft was disconnected in 1833. Between 1786 and 1833 Lutheran services were held at the Old St Nicholas Church in the Römerberg square to the south, also owned by the free city and then actually used as garrison church for its troops.\n\nIn 1830, the free city issued the \"deeds of dotation\" (\"Dotationsurkunde\") fixing its long-lasting practice of owning and maintaining the church buildings in its old city centre (so-called dotation churches; Dotationskirchen), but leaving their usage to congregations of the Lutheran state church or parishes of the Catholic church, newly emancipated during the Napoleonic era. The \"deed of dotation\" statutorily established the eternal gratuitous usufruct of nine city-owned church buildings by six Lutheran congregations and three Catholic parishes. Other religious groups, such as Jews and Reformed Protestants were not part of that government funding.\nBecause of its typical Protestant centralised design (\"Predigtkirche\"), allowing everybody easily to hear the preacher or speaker, it was desired as the meeting place for the Frankfurt Parliament in the course of the German revolutions of 1848.\n\nFrom 31 March until 3 April 1848, the building was the meeting place for the \"Vorparlament\", which prepared the election for the National Assembly. On 18 May 1848, the National Assembly met for the first time in the church, and was therefore named the \"Paulskirchenparlament\". Until 1849, the National Assembly worked in the church to develop the first constitution for a united Germany. The resistance of Prussia, the Austrian Empire and a number of smaller German states ultimately destroyed the effort.\n\nIn May 1849, there were a number of uprisings to force the implementation of the constitution, but these were destroyed with the help of Prussia. On 30 May 1849, the \"Paulskirchenparlament\" was dissolved. After 1852, St. Paul's was again used for Lutheran services.\n\nIn March 1944, during World War II, the church was destroyed along with much of the Frankfurt wider city centre in the Allied Bombing of Frankfurt. As a tribute to its symbolism of freedom and as the cradle of Germany, it was the first structure in Frankfurt the city rebuilt after the war. However, the city itself wanted to make use of the to-be-reconstructed building, thus St. Paul's Lutheran congregation and the city concluded to exchange the congregation's usufruct to this building for that of old St. Nicholas Church, only damaged by bombing.\n\nSt. Paul's was reopened on the centennial of the Frankfurt Parliament. Due to financial restraints and an altered concept of use, the original inner form was dramatically altered by the architectural team of Rudolf Schwarz. An inserted floor now divides the basement—which currently serves as a display room—from the actual hall in the main floor.\n\nIn 1963, US President John F. Kennedy gave a major speech in the \"Paulskirche\" during his visit to the country.\n\nFor the 150th birthday of the German democratic experience in 1998, St Paul's once again attracted public interest.\n\nToday St. Paul's is no longer used as a church, instead it became a venue used for various displays and events. The most well-known is the annual awarding of the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade during the Frankfurt Book Fair.\n"}

They had lower costs and fewer logistical complications than major productions. To achieve this, producers typically eliminated much of the dialogue, plot and chorus of the parent, often Broadway production, reduced the scenery to a few flats and platforms that could be easily transported by rail or roadway, and retained only the hit numbers and the principal characters including the love interests and the chief comic. With this shortened format, tab shows did not usually serve as an entertainment form in themselves but were adjuncts for at least three other forms of major entertainment. First, they could be the featured act of the second half of a vaudeville bill. The substitution of these shows for a portion of vaudeville acts in the early 1900s was described as \"far-reaching in its scope\" in a \"Billboard\" article of 23 December 1911.\n\nSecond, they were often performed in conjunction with silent films for a half hour performance either before the film came on, or as a vaudeville act between films. Show Boat was one Broadway hit that was reduced to a truncated tab show running in movie theaters in the early 1930s.\n\nThird, tab shows were closely related to the early, non-stripper versions of burlesque. The girls were 'clean' and did not have bare legs. By the 1920s, \"tab show\" was sometimes used to avoid the negative, low-brow connotations of \"burlesque\".\n\nThere are two suggestions for the origin of the word \"tab\". It is often said to be derived from \"tabloid\", as in the short form of a newspaper. Alternatively, it could refer to \"tableau\" as in the tab style of curtain across the front of a stage, since the curtain and a few pieces of furniture might be the only scenery used by a tab show.\n\nAs variations on these themes, tab shows occasionally were up to two hours in length and with their lower costs and fewer logistic demands, were a popular alternative to vaudeville acts in the 1910s. Also, while the term \"tab show\" may have been restricted to the United States, the theme of the vicissitudes of traveling third-rate vaudevillians was presented in 1950 in Federico Fellini's Italian film \"Variety Lights\". It has been described as \"wholesome corn\".\n"}

It became the inspiration for two films (see below for details). It was originally published by Chapman and Hall in 1909, but because the copyright has expired, the text of the book is now in the public domain. There was a \"new and illustrated\" edition, with illustrations by Emile Verpilleux, published a year later in 1910. It may fairly be described as a sentimental novel: Temple Thurston himself wrote that \"To many, from the first page to the last, it had not the faintest conception of reality, and indeed has earned for me the classification of sentimentalist\". This was in the Author's Note to the sequel, entitled \"The World of Wonderful Reality\", published a decade later in 1919. His obituary in \"The Times\" (20 March 1933) stated that \"there were those who might suggest that sentimentalism was too evident in Temple Thurston's work\". As well as being a vehicle for Edwardian romanticism, the novel shares the Roman Catholic faith of its author with its main characters. It is a tale of two cities: mainly Edwardian London – the sidelights on life in London for the shabby genteel are interesting – but also Venice.\n\nThe first film based on the novel was \"The City of Beautiful Nonsense\", a silent movie released in 1919, which featured Henry Edwards, Chrissie White and Henry Vibart\n\nThe second film was a talkie, released in 1935 as \"City of Beautiful Nonsense\". It starred Emlyn Williams, Sophie Stewart and Eve Lister. Both were filmed and produced in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}
{"id": "41055953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41055953", "title": "The Philadelphia study", "text": "The Philadelphia study\n\nThe Philadelphia study was a study designed to test the Curvilinear principle as referred to by William Labov, through careful gathering and analysis of research on language variants in five Philadelphia neighborhoods. His research goal was to \"...discover the social location of the innovators of linguistic change and therefore focuses on the embedding of individuals in their neighborhood.\" \n\nTo test his hypothesis, Labov identified socially and ethnically central groups by gathering information on five Philadelphia neighborhoods through census data and initial surveys. He selected particular blocks in each neighborhood as an initial research point using a specific set of criteria including full occupancy of dwellings, high levels of interaction between people, and public spaces where interaction can occur. The field workers presented their research goals to the residents broadly and “without singling out language for specific attention” in the sociolinguistic interviews. The goals of these interviews were to gather social data on the residents, their block, and the neighborhood and analyze linguistic variants without facing the problem of the Observer's paradox. That is, the field workers attempted to create an environment where the speaker would speak informally.\n\nTo gauge each speaker’s social position within the community, Labov created a socioeconomic status index based on education and occupation, each ranked on levels from 0 to 6, where 6 was the highest level of education or occupation. He studied a series of “new and vigorous” vowel changes, including the fronting and raising of (aw) and (ey) and the centralization of (ey). He also studied the nearly completed changes involving (ow) and (aeh) and incipient changes such as the lowering of (e) and (ae).\n\nLabov discovered that incipient changes did not provide a strong correlation with age or social class because these variants were too early in their stages of development to display any social significance. The nearly completed and most advanced changes displayed the most stability within the study and showed intermediate correlation with the middle classes. The new and vigorous changes—the focal point of the study—displayed the strongest curvilinearity and most clearly encompassed the linguistically innovative nature of the inner classes.\n\nThrough these Results, Labov asserted the truth and significance of what he named the Curvilinear Principle. With the social information gathered from the interviews, he discovered that it is not the education or occupation factors that drove the middle class to spur linguistic change. Rather, it was the central location within their communities—both socially and literally. They were not only central in the social hierarchy, but also in their local environments and interactions.\n\nLabov considered age as a factor in his research along with social class, occupation, and education. He discovered in the majority of vowel variables, adolescents aged 13–16 had the highest values of use of innovative forms. To eliminate bias and errors due to other social factors such as age, Labov created the Philadelphia Telephone Study to corroborate the curvilinear hypothesis.\n\nThe telephone study was designed as a means to cancel out any possible errors that may have occurred in the neighborhood study, including but not limited to errors in selecting neighborhood representatives, errors in choosing neighborhoods to represent Philadelphia class distribution, and errors involving the physical research equipment. The telephone survey was done through random sampling of Philadelphia phone numbers, and therefore eliminated the biases that occur with selection of neighborhoods and interviewees. Due to the nature of telephone interviews, there was a possibility of error from the quality of sound, but this error was not present in the neighborhood study. The findings of the telephone study were closely related to the findings of the neighborhood study, strengthening the curvilinear hypothesis and leading Labov to the creation of the principle.\n"}
{"id": "32632", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32632", "title": "Veneration of the dead", "text": "Veneration of the dead\n\nThe veneration of the dead, including one's ancestors, is based on love and respect for the deceased. In some cultures, it is related to beliefs that the dead have a continued existence, and may possess the ability to influence the fortune of the living. Some groups venerate their direct, familial ancestors. Certain sects and religions, in particular the Roman Catholic Church, venerate saints as intercessors with God, as well as pray for departed souls in Purgatory.\n\nIn Europe, Asia, and Oceania, and in some African and Afro-diasporic cultures, the goal of ancestor veneration is to ensure the ancestors' continued well-being and positive disposition towards the living, and sometimes to ask for special favours or assistance. The social or non-religious function of ancestor veneration is to cultivate kinship values, such as filial piety, family loyalty, and continuity of the family lineage. Ancestor veneration occurs in societies with every degree of social, political, and technological complexity, and it remains an important component of various religious practices in modern times.\n\nAncestor reverence is not the same as the worship of a deity or deities. In some Afro-diasporic cultures, ancestors are seen as being able to intercede on behalf of the living, often as messengers between humans and the gods. As spirits who were once human themselves, they are seen as being better able to understand human needs than would a divine being. In other cultures, the purpose of ancestor veneration is not to ask for favors but to do one's filial duty. Some cultures believe that their ancestors actually need to be provided for by their descendants, and their practices include offerings of food and other provisions. Others do not believe that the ancestors are even aware of what their descendants do for them, but that the expression of filial piety is what is important.\n\nMost cultures who practice ancestor veneration do not call it \"ancestor worship\". In English, the word \"worship\" usually refers to the reverent love and devotion accorded a deity (god) or God. However, in other cultures, this act of worship does not confer any belief that the departed ancestors have become some kind of deity. Rather, the act is a way to respect, honor and look after ancestors in their afterlives as well as seek their guidance for their living descendants. In this regard, many cultures and religions have similar practices. Some may visit the graves of their parents or other ancestors, leave flowers and pray to them in order to honor and remember them, while also asking their ancestors to continue to look after them. However, this would not be considered as worshipping them since the term \"worship\" shows no such meaning.\n\nIn that sense the phrase \"ancestor veneration\" may convey a more accurate sense of what practitioners, such as the Chinese and other Buddhist-influenced and Confucian-influenced societies, as well as the African and European cultures see themselves as doing. This is consistent with the meaning of the word \"veneration\" in English, that is great respect or reverence caused by the dignity, wisdom, or dedication of a person.\n\nAlthough there is no generally accepted theory concerning the origins of ancestor veneration, this social phenomenon appears in some form in all human cultures documented so far. David-Barrett and Carney claim that ancestor veneration might have served a group coordination role during human evolution, and thus it was the mechanism that led to religious representation fostering group cohesion.\n\nAlthough some historians claim that ancient Egyptian society was a \"death cult\" because of its elaborate tombs and mummification rituals, it was the opposite. The philosophy that \"this world is but a vale of tears\" and that to die and be with God is a better existence than an earthly one was relatively unknown among the ancient Egyptians. This was not to say that they were unacquainted with the harshness of life; rather, their ethos included a sense of continuity between this life and the next. The Egyptian people loved the culture, customs and religion of their daily lives so much that they wanted to continue them in the next—although some might hope for a better station in the Beautiful West (Egyptian afterlife).\n\nTombs were housing in the Hereafter and so they were carefully constructed and decorated, just as homes for the living were. Mummification was a way to preserve the corpse so the \"ka\" (soul) of the deceased could return to receive offerings of the things s/he enjoyed while alive. If mummification was not affordable, a \"ka-statue\" in the likeness of the deceased was carved for this purpose. The Blessed Dead were collectively called the \"akhu\", or \"shining ones\" (singular: \"akh\"). They were described as \"shining as gold in the belly of Nut\" (Gr. Nuit) and were indeed depicted as golden stars on the roofs of many tombs and temples.\n\nThe process by which a \"ka\" became an \"akh\" was not automatic upon death; it involved a 70-day journey through the \"duat\", or Otherworld, which led to judgment before Wesir (Gr. Osiris), Lord of the Dead where the \"ka’\"s heart would be weighed on a scale against the Feather of Ma’at (representing Truth). However, if the \"ka\" was not properly prepared, this journey could be fraught with dangerous pitfalls and strange demons; hence some of the earliest religious texts discovered, such as the Papyrus of Ani (commonly known as The Book of the Dead) and the Pyramid Texts were actually written as guides to help the deceased successfully navigate the \"duat\".\n\nIf the heart was in balance with the Feather of Ma'at, the \"ka\" passed judgment and was granted access to the Beautiful West as an \"akh\" who was \"ma’a heru\" (\"true of voice\") to dwell among the gods and other \"akhu\". At this point only was the \"ka\" deemed worthy to be venerated by the living through rites and offerings. Those who became lost in the \"duat\" or deliberately tried to avoid judgment became the unfortunate (and sometimes dangerous) \"mutu\", the Restless Dead. For the few whose truly evil hearts outweighed the Feather, the goddess Ammit waited patiently behind Wesir’s judgment seat to consume them. She was a composite creature resembling three of the deadliest animals in Egypt: the crocodile, the hippopotamus and the lion. Being fed to Ammit was to be consigned to the Eternal Void, to be \"unmade\" as a \"ka\".\n\nBesides being eaten by Ammit, the worst fate a \"ka\" could suffer after physical death was to be forgotten. For this reason, ancestor veneration in ancient Egypt was an important rite of remembrance in order to keep the \"ka\" \"alive\" in this life as well as in the next. Royals, nobles and the wealthy made contracts with their local priests to perform prayers and give offerings at their tombs. In return, the priests were allowed to keep a portion of the offerings as payment for services rendered. Some tomb inscriptions even invited passers-by to speak aloud the names of the deceased within (which also helped to perpetuate their memory), and to offer water, prayers or other things if they so desired. In the private homes of the less wealthy, niches were carved into the walls for the purpose of housing images of familial \"akhu\" and to serve as altars of veneration.\n\nMany of these same religious beliefs and ancestor veneration practices are still carried on today in the religion of Kemetic Orthodoxy.\n\nThe Romans, like many Mediterranean societies, regarded the bodies of the dead as polluting. During Rome's Classical period, the body was most often cremated, and the ashes placed in a tomb outside the city walls. Much of the month of February was devoted to purifications, propitiation, and veneration of the dead, especially at the nine-day festival of the Parentalia during which a family honored its ancestors. The family visited the cemetery and shared cake and wine, both in the form of offerings to the dead and as a meal among themselves. The Parentalia drew to a close on February 21 with the more somber Feralia, a public festival of sacrifices and offerings to the Manes, the potentially malevolent spirits of the dead who required propitiation. One of the most common inscriptional phrases on Latin epitaphs is \"Dis Manibus\", abbreviated \"D.M,\" \"for the Manes gods\", which appears even on s. The Caristia on February 22 was a celebration of the family line as it continued into the present.\n\nA noble Roman family displayed ancestral images (\"imagines\") in the tablinium of their home \"(domus)\". Some sources indicate these portraits were busts, while others suggest that funeral masks were also displayed. The masks, probably modeled of wax from the face of the deceased, were part of the funeral procession when an elite Roman died. Professional mourners wore the masks and regalia of the dead person's ancestors as the body was carried from the home, through the streets, and to its final resting place.\n\nAncestor veneration is prevalent throughout Africa, and serves as the basis of many religions. It is often augmented by a belief in a supreme being, but prayers and/or sacrifices are usually offered to the ancestors who may ascend to becoming a kind of minor deities themselves. Ancestor veneration remains among many Africans, sometimes practiced alongside the later adopted religions of Christianity (as in Nigeria among the Igbo people), and Islam (among the different Mandé peoples and the Bamum) in much of the continent. In orthodox Serer religion, the pangool is venerated by the Serer people.\n\nThe Seereer people of Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania who adhere to the tenets of A ƭat Roog (Seereer religion) believe in the veneration of the pangool (ancient Seereer saints and/or ancestral spirits). There are various types of pangool (singular: \"fangol\"), each with its own means of veneration.\n\nVeneration of ancestors is prevalent throughout the island of Madagascar. Approximately half of the country's population of 20 million currently practice traditional religion, which tends to emphasize links between the living and the \"razana\" (ancestors). The veneration of ancestors has led to the widespread tradition of tomb building, as well as the highlands practice of the \"famadihana\", whereby a deceased family member's remains may be exhumed to be periodically re-wrapped in fresh silk shrouds before being replaced in the tomb. The famadihana is an occasion to celebrate the beloved ancestor's memory, reunite with family and community, and enjoy a festive atmosphere. Residents of surrounding villages are often invited to attend the party, where food and rum are typically served and a hiragasy troupe or other musical entertainment is commonly present. Veneration of ancestors is also demonstrated through adherence to \"fady\", taboos that are respected during and after the lifetime of the person who establishes them. It is widely believed that by showing respect for ancestors in these ways, they may intervene on behalf of the living. Conversely, misfortunes are often attributed to ancestors whose memory or wishes have been neglected. The sacrifice of zebu is a traditional method used to appease or honor the ancestors. Small, everyday gestures of respect include throwing the first capful of a newly opened bottle of rum into the northeast corner of the room to give the ancestors their due share.\n\nAncestral veneration in some cultures (such as Chinese) (敬祖, pinyin: \"jìngzǔ\"), as well as ancestor worship (拜祖, pinyin: \"bàizǔ\"), seeks to honor and reminiscence the actions of the deceased; the ultimate homage to the dead. The importance of paying respect to parents (and elders) lies with the fact that all physical bodily aspects of one's being were created by one's parents, who continued to tend to one's well-being until one is on firm footings. The respect and the homage to parents, is to return this gracious deed to them in life and after, the ultimate homage. The \"shi\" (尸; \"corpse, personator\") was a Zhou dynasty (1045 BCE-256 BCE) sacrificial representative of a dead relative. During a \"shi\" ceremony, the ancestral spirit supposedly would enter the personator, who would eat and drink sacrificial offerings and convey spiritual messages.\n\nSacrifices are sometimes made to altars as food for the deceased. This falls under the modes of communication with the Chinese spiritual world concepts. Some of the veneration includes visiting the deceased at their graves, and making or buying offerings for the deceased in the Spring, Autumn, and Ghost Festivals. Due to the hardships of the late 19th- and 20th-century China, when meat and poultry were difficult to come by, sumptuous feasts are still offered in some Asian countries as a practice to the spirits or ancestors. However, in the orthodox Taoist and Buddhist rituals, only vegetarian food would suffice.\n\nFor those with deceased in the afterlife or hell, elaborate or even creative offerings, such as servants, refrigerators, houses, car, paper money and shoes are provided so that the deceased will be able to have these items after they have died. Often, paper versions of these objects are burned for the same purpose. Originally, real-life objects were buried with the dead. In time these goods were replaced by full size clay models which in turn were replaced by scale models, and in time today's paper offerings (including paper servants).\n\nIn Korea, ancestor veneration is referred to by the generic term \"jerye\" (hangul: 제례; hanja: ) or \"jesa\" (hangul: 제사; hanja: ). Notable examples of \"jerye\" include \"Munmyo jerye\" and \"Jongmyo jerye\", which are performed periodically each year for venerated Confucian scholars and kings of ancient times, respectively. The ceremony held on the anniversary of a family member's death is called \"charye\" (차례). It is still practiced today.\n\nThe majority of Catholics, Buddhists and nonbelievers practice ancestral rites, although Protestants do not. The Catholic ban on ancestral rituals was lifted in 1939, when the Catholic Church formally recognized ancestral rites as a civil practice.\n\nAncestral rites are typically divided into three categories:\n\nAncestor veneration is one of the most unifying aspects of Vietnamese culture, as practically all Vietnamese, regardless of religious affiliation (Buddhist or Catholic) have an ancestor altar in their home or business.\n\nIn Vietnam, traditionally people did not celebrate birthdays (before Western influence), but the death anniversary of one's loved one was always an important occasion. Besides an essential gathering of family members for a banquet in memory of the deceased, incense sticks are burned along with hell notes, and great platters of food are made as offerings on the ancestor altar, which usually has pictures or plaques with the names of the deceased. In case of missing persons believed dead their family, a Wind tomb is made, an empty tomb to venerate their dead.\n\nThese offerings and practices are done frequently during important traditional or religious celebrations, the starting of a new business, or even when a family member needs guidance or counsel and is a hallmark of the emphasis Vietnamese culture places on filial duty.\n\nA significant distinguishing feature of Vietnamese ancestor veneration is that women have traditionally been allowed to participate and co-officiate ancestral rites, unlike in Chinese Confucian doctrine, which allows only male descendants to perform such rites.\n\nAncestor worship is no longer present in modern-day Burma (except within some ethnic minority communities), but remnants of it still exist, such as worship of Bo Bo Gyi (literally \"great grandfather\"), as well as of other guardian spirits such as nats, all of which may be vestiges of historic ancestor worship.\n\nAncestor worship was present in the royal court in pre-colonial Burma. During the Konbaung dynasty, solid gold images of deceased kings and their consorts were worshiped three times a year by the royal family, during the Burmese New Year (\"Thingyan\"), at the beginning and at the end of the Buddhist lent. The images were stored in the treasury and worshiped at the Zetawunzaung (, \"Hall of Ancestors\"), along with a book of odes.\n\nSome scholars attribute the disappearance of ancestor worship to the influence of Buddhist doctrines of anicca and anatta, impermanence and rejection of a 'self'.\n\nDuring Pchum Ben and the Cambodian New Year people make offerings to their ancestors.\n\nAncestors are acknowledged and honoured in Indian Subcontinent among Hindus. When a person dies, the family observes a thirteen-day mourning period, generally called \"śrāddha\". A year thence, they observe the ritual of Tarpan, in which the family makes offerings to the deceased. During these rituals, the family prepares the food items that the deceased liked and offers food to the deceased. They offer this food to crows as well on certain days as it is believed that the soul comes in the form of a bird to taste it. They are also obliged to offer \"śrāddha\", a small feast of specific preparations, to eligible Bramhins. Only after these rituals are the family members allowed to eat. It is believed that this reminds the ancestor's spirits that they are not forgotten and are loved, so it brings them peace. On Shradh days, people pray that the souls of ancestors be appeased, forget any animosity and find peace.\n\nEach year, on the particular date (as per the Hindu calendar) when the person had died, the family members repeat this ritual.\n\nApart from this, there is also a fortnight-long duration each year called \"Pitru Paksha\" (\"fortnight of ancestors\"), when the family remembers all its ancestors and offers \"Tarpan\" to them. This period falls just before the Navratri or Durga Puja falling in the month of Ashwin. Mahalaya marks the end of the fortnight-long Tarpan to the ancestors.\n\nThe \"paliya\" memorial stones are associated with ancestral worship in western India.\n\nMe-Dam-Me-Phi is celebrated by the Ahom people on 31 January every year in memory of the departed. It is the manifestation of the concept of ancestor worship that the Ahoms share with other peoples originating from the Tai-Shan stock. It is a festival to show respect to the departed ancestors and remember their contribution to society.\n\nIn Indonesia ancestor worship has been a tradition of some of the indigenous people. Podom of the Toba Batak, Waruga of the Minahasans and the coffins of the Karo people (Indonesia) are a few examples of the forms the veneration takes.\n\nIn the animistic indigenous religions of the precolonial Philippines, ancestor spirits were one of the two major types of spirits (\"anito\") with whom shamans communicate. Ancestor spirits were known as \"umalagad\" (lit. \"guardian\" or \"caretaker\"). They can be the spirits of actual ancestors or generalized guardian spirits of a family. Ancient Filipinos believed that upon death, the soul of a person travels (usually by boat) to a spirit world. There can be multiple locations in the spirit world, varying in different ethnic groups. Which place souls end up in depends on how they died, the age at death, or conduct of the person when they were alive. There was no concept of heaven or hell prior to the introduction of Christianity and Islam; rather, the spirit world is usually depicted as an underworld that is a mirror image of the material (\"upper\") world. Souls reunite with deceased relatives in the underworld and lead normal lives in the underworld as they did in the material world. In some cases, the souls of evil people undergo penance and cleansing before they are granted entrance into a particular spirit realm. Souls would eventually reincarnate after a period of time in the spirit world.\n\nSouls in the spirit world still retain a degree of influence in the material world, and vice versa. \"Paganito\" rituals may be used to invoke good ancestor spirits for protection, intercession, or advice. Vengeful spirits of the dead can manifest as apparitions or ghosts (\"mantiw\") and cause harm to living people. \"Paganito\" can be used to appease or banish them. Ancestor spirits also figured prominently during illness or death, as they were believed to be the ones who call the soul to the underworld, guide the soul (a psychopomp), or meet the soul upon arrival.\n\nAncestor spirits are also known as \"kalading\" among the Cordillerans; \"tonong\" among the Maguindanao and Maranao; \"umboh\" among the Sama-Bajau; \"ninunò\" among Tagalogs; and \"nono\" among Bicolanos. Ancestor spirits are usually represented by carved figures called \"taotao\". These were carved by the community upon a person's death. Every household had a \"taotao\" stored in a shelf in the corner of the house.\n\nThe predominantly Roman Catholic Filipino people still hold ancestors in particular esteem—though without the formality common to their neighbours—despite having been Christianised since coming into contact with Spanish missionaries in 1521. In the present day, ancestor veneration is expressed in having photographs of the dead by the home altar, a common fixture in many Filipino Christian homes. Candles are often kept burning before the photographs, which are sometimes decorated with garlands of fresh sampaguita, the national flower. Ancestors, particularly dead parents, are still regarded as psychopomps, as a dying person is said to be brought to the afterlife (Tagalog: \"sundô\", \"fetch\") by the spirits of dead relatives. It is said that when the dying call out the names of deceased loved ones, they can see the spirits of those particular people waiting at the foot of the deathbed.\n\nFilipino Catholic and Aglipayan veneration of the dead finds its greatest expression in the Philippines is the Hallowmas season between 31 October and 2 November, variously called \"Undás\" (based on the word for \"[the] first\", the Spanish \"andas\" or possibly \"honra\"), \"Todos los Santos\" (literally \"All Saints\"), and sometimes \"Áraw ng mga Patáy\" (lit. \"Day of the Dead\"), which refers to the following solemnity of All Souls' Day. Filipinos traditionally observe this day by visiting the family dead, cleaning and repairing their tombs. Common offerings are prayers, flowers, candles, and even food, while many also spend the remainder of the day and ensuing night holding reunions at the graveyard, playing games and music or singing.\n\nChinese Filipinos, meanwhile, have the most apparent and distinct customs related to ancestor veneration, carried over from traditional Chinese religion and most often melded with their current Catholic faith. Many still burn incense and kim at family tombs and before photos at home, while they incorporate Chinese practises into Masses held during the All Souls' Day period.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, making offerings to one's ancestors is conducted on the sixth day after death as a part of traditional Sri Lankan funeral rites.\n\nIn rural northern Thailand, a religious ceremony honoring ancestral spirits known as \"faun phii\" (\"spirit dance\" or \"ghost dance\") takes place. It includes offerings for ancestors with spirit mediums sword fighting, spirit-possessed dancing, and spirit mediums cock fighting in a spiritual cockfight.\n\nIn Catholic countries in Europe (continued later with the Anglican Church in England), November 1 (All Saints' Day), became known and is still known as the day to honor those who have died, and who have been deemed official saints by the Church. November 2, (All Souls Day), or \"The Day of the Dead\", is the day when all of the faithful dead are remembered. On that day, families go to cemeteries to light candles for their dead relatives, leave them flowers, and often to picnic. The evening before All Saints'—\"All Hallows Eve\" or \"Hallowe'en\"—is unofficially the Catholic day to remember the realities of Hell, to mourn the souls lost to evil, and to remember ways to avoid Hell . It is commonly celebrated in the United States and parts of the United Kingdom in a spirit of light-hearted horror and fear, which is marked by the recounting of ghost stories, bonfires, wearing costumes, carving jack-o'-lanterns, and \"trick-or-treating\" (going door to door and begging for candy).\n\nIn Cornwall and Wales, the autumn ancestor festivals occur around Nov. 1. In Cornwall the festival is known as \"Kalan Gwav\", and in Wales as \"Calan Gaeaf.\" The festivals bear some similarities to the better-known Gaelic festival of Samhain, from which modern Halloween is derived.\n\nDuring \"Samhain\", November 1 in Ireland and Scotland, the dead are thought to return to the world of the living, and offerings of food and light are left for them. On the festival day, ancient people would extinguish the hearth fires in their homes, participate in a community bonfire festival, and then carry a flame home from the communal fire and use it light their home fires anew. This custom has continued to some extent into modern times, in both the Celtic nations and the diaspora. Lights in the window to guide the dead home are left burning all night. On the Isle of Man the festival is known as \"old Sauin\" or \"Hop-tu-Naa\".\n\nNative cultures of the original inhabitants of North America honored the dead with various traditional ceremonies, including food offerings and prayers.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, flowers, wreaths, grave decorations and sometimes candles or even small pebbles are put on graves year-round as a way to honor the dead. In the United States, many people honor deceased loved ones who were in the military on Decoration Day also known as Memorial Day. Times like Easter, Christmas, Candlemas, and All Souls' Day are also special days in which the relatives and friends of the deceased gather to honor them with flowers and candles. In the Catholic Church, one's local parish church often offers prayers for the dead on their death anniversary or on special days like All Souls' Day.\n\nAnother important holiday in the United States, Memorial Day, is a Federal holiday for remembering the men and women who served in the nation's military that are now deceased; particularly those who died in war or during active service. In the 147 national cemeteries, like Arlington and Gettysburg, it is common for volunteers to place small American flags at each grave. Memorial Day is observed on the last Monday in May, allotting for a 3 day weekend in which many memorial services and parades take place not only across the country, but in 26 American cemeteries on foreign soil; in the countries of France, Belgium, United Kingdom. Philippines, Panama, Italy, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, and Tunisia. It is also common practice among veterans to memorialize fallen service members on the dates of their death. That practice is also common in other countries when remembering Americans who died in battles to liberate their towns in the World Wars. One example of this is on 16 August (1944) Colonel Griffith, died of wounds from enemy action sustained in Lèves, the same day he is credited with saving Chartres Cathedral from destruction.\n\nMany Mexicans celebrate \"Dia de los Muertos\" (Day of the Dead) on or around All Saints' Day (November 1), this being a mix of a native Mesoamerican celebration and an imported European holiday. \"Ofrendas\" (altars) are set up, with \"calaveras\" (sugar skulls), photographs of departed loved ones, marigold flowers, candles, and more.\n\nIn Judaism, when a grave site is visited, a small pebble is placed on the headstone. While there is no clear answer as to why, this custom of leaving pebbles may date back to biblical days when individuals were buried under piles of stones. Today, they are left as tokens that people have been there to visit and to remember.\n\nAmericans of various religions and cultures may build a shrine in their home dedicated to loved ones who have died, with pictures of their ancestors, flowers and mementos. Increasingly, many roadside shrines may be seen for deceased relatives who died in car accidents or were killed on that spot, sometimes financed by the state or province as these markers serve as potent reminders to drive cautiously in hazardous areas. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., is particularly known for the leaving of offerings to the deceased; items left are collected by the National Park Service and archived. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints perform posthumous baptisms and other rituals for their dead ancestors, along with those of other families, with the permission of their descendants.\n\nIslam has a complex and mixed view on the idea of grave shrines and ancestor worship. The graves of many early Islamic figures are holy sites for Muslims, including Mohammed, Ali, and a cemetery with many companions and early caliphs. Many other mausoleums are major architectural, political, and cultural sites, including the National Mausoleum in Pakistan and the Taj Mahal in India. However, the religious movement of Wahhabism views this veneration of graves as a form of idolatry. Followers of this movement have destroyed many gravesite shrines, including in Saudi Arabia and in territory controlled by the Islamic State.\n\n"}

Additional Thongor stories written after Carter's death by his literary executor Robert Price were combined with the existing tales to fill out the existing book, though it omits at least one Price Thongor story, \"Witch-Queen of Lemuria.\"\n\n"}
