McKellen first performed the recital in Scandinavia in 1980 and later performed it throughout the world. It was broadcast by PBS in 1982. For the 1984 Broadway engagement, McKellen received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show and a Tony Award nomination. He received internationally rave reviews with some calling him \"The new Olivier\" and \"The greatest classical actor of our generation\". The most recent performance was in Jersey Opera House in 1990.\n\nIn 1993 McKellen developed another one-man show, 'A Knight Out' (using the play on word as a result of his being knighted in 1991) but this time focusing, as well as stage roles, his now ever increasing film roles. As with Acting Shakespeare he toured around England, Europe and America to great acclaim.\n\nA predecessor of this show's format was Sir John Gielgud's Ages of Man (play) which consisted of Gielgud in front of an audience with a mixture of both speeches and anecdotes.\n\n"}

{"id": "82238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=82238", "title": "Articulatory phonetics", "text": "Articulatory phonetics\n\nThe field of articulatory phonetics is a subfield of phonetics. In studying articulation, phoneticians explain how humans produce speech sounds via the interaction of different physiological structures.\n\nGenerally, articulatory phonetics is concerned with the transformation of aerodynamic energy into acoustic energy. Aerodynamic energy refers to the airflow through the vocal tract. Its potential form is air pressure; its kinetic form is the actual dynamic airflow. Acoustic energy is variation in the air pressure that can be represented as sound waves, which are then perceived by the human auditory system as sound.\n\nThe vocal tract can be viewed through an aerodynamic-biomechanic model that includes three main components:\n\n\nAir cavities are containers of air molecules of specific volumes and masses. The main air cavities present in the articulatory system are the supraglottal cavity and the subglottal cavity. They are so-named because the glottis, the openable space between the vocal folds internal to the larynx, separates the two cavities. The supraglottal cavity or the orinasal cavity is divided into an oral subcavity (the cavity from the glottis to the lips excluding the nasal cavity) and a nasal subcavity (the cavity from the velopharyngeal port, which can be closed by raising the velum). The subglottal cavity consists of the trachea and the lungs. The atmosphere external to the articulatory stem may also be considered an air cavity whose potential connecting points with respect to the body are the nostrils and the lips.\n\nPistons are initiators. The term \"initiator\" refers to the fact that they are used to initiate a change in the volumes of air cavities, and, by Boyle's Law, the corresponding air pressure of the cavity. The term \"initiation\" refers to the change. Since changes in air pressures between connected cavities lead to airflow between the cavities, initiation is also referred to as an \"airstream mechanism\". The three pistons present in the articulatory system are the larynx, the tongue body, and the physiological structures used to manipulate lung volume (in particular, the floor and the walls of the chest). The lung pistons are used to initiate a pulmonic airstream (found in all human languages). The larynx is used to initiate the glottalic airstream mechanism by changing the volume of the supraglottal and subglottal cavities via vertical movement of the larynx (with a closed glottis). Ejectives and implosives are made with this airstream mechanism. The tongue body creates a velaric airsteam by changing the pressure within the oral cavity: the tongue body changes the mouth subcavity. Click consonants use the velaric airstream mechanism. Pistons are controlled by various muscles.\n\nValves regulate airflow between cavities. Airflow occurs when an air valve is open and there is a pressure difference between the connecting cavities. When an air valve is closed, there is no airflow. The air valves are the vocal folds (the glottis), which regulate between the supraglottal and subglottal cavities, the velopharyngeal port, which regulates between the oral and nasal cavities, the tongue, which regulates between the oral cavity and the atmosphere, and the lips, which also regulate between the oral cavity and the atmosphere. Like the pistons, the air valves are also controlled by various muscles.\n\nTo produce any kind of sound, there must be movement of air. To produce sounds that people can interpret as spoken words, the movement of air must pass through the vocal cords, up through the throat and, into the mouth or nose to then leave the body. Different sounds are formed by different positions of the mouth—or, as linguists call it, \"the oral cavity\" (to distinguish it from the nasal cavity).\n\nSounds of all languages fall under two categories: Consonants and Vowels.\n\nConsonants are produced with some form of restriction or closing in the vocal tract that hinders the airflow from the lungs. Consonants are classified according to where in the vocal tract the airflow has been restricted. This is also known as the place of articulation.\n\nMovement of the tongue and lips can create these constrictions and by forming the oral cavity in different ways, different sounds can be produced.\n\nBilabial sounds are produced with both lips, such as [b], [m], and [p].\n\n[f] and [v] are articulated by placing the upper teeth against the lower lip.\n\n[θ] and [ð] are both spelled as \"th\" (θ as in think) (ð as in the). They are pronounced by inserting the tip of the tongue between the teeth.\n\n[t] [d] [n] [s] [z] [l] [r] are produced in many ways where the tongue is raised towards the alveolar ridge.\n\n[t, d, n] the tip of the tongue is raised and touches the ridge.\n\n[s, z] the sides of the front of the tongue are raised, but the tip is lowered so that air escapes over it.\n\n[l] the tip of the tongue is raised while the rest of the tongue remains down, permitting air to escape over its sides. Hence, [l] is called a lateral sound (âm biên).\n\n[r] [IPA ɹ] curl the tip of tongue back behind the alveolar ridge, or bunch up the top of the tongue behind the ridge, the air escapes through the central part of the mouth.\n\n[ʃ] [ʒ] [tʃ] [dʒ] [j] are produced by raising the front part of the tongue to the palate.\n\n[k] [ɡ] [ŋ] are produced by raising the back part of the tongue to the soft palate or the velum.\n\n[ʀ] [q] [ԍ] these sounds are produced by raising the back of the tongue to the uvula. The 'r' in French and German may be an uvular trill (symbolized by [ʀ]). The uvular sounds [q] and [ԍ] occur in Arabic. These do not normally occur in English.\n\n[h] [ʔ] the sound [h] is from the flow of air coming from an open glottis, past the tongue and lips as they prepare to pronounce a vowel sound, which always follows [h]. if the air is stopped completely at the glottis by tightly closed vocal cords the sound upon release of the cords is called a glottal stop [ʔ].\n\nVowels are produced by the passage of air through the larynx and the vocal tract. Most vowels are voiced (i.e. the vocal folds are vibrating). Except in some marginal cases, the vocal tract is open, so that the airstream is able to escape without generating fricative noise.\n\nVariation in vowel quality is produced by means of the following articulatory structures:\n\nThe larynx is used to differentiate voiced and voiceless vowels. In addition, the pitch of the vowel is changed by altering the frequency of vibration of the vocal folds. In some languages there are contrasts among vowels with different phonation types.\n\nVowels may be made pharyngealized (also \"epiglottalized\", \"sphincteric\" or \"strident\") by means of a retraction of the tongue root. Vowels may also be articulated with advanced tongue root. There is discussion of whether this vowel feature (ATR) is different from the Tense/Lax distinction in vowels. \nVowels are normally produced with the soft palate raised so that no air escapes through the nose. However, vowels may be nasalized as a result of lowering the soft palate. Many languages use nasalization contrastively. \nThe tongue is a highly flexible organ that is capable of being moved in many different ways. For vowel articulation the principal variations are vowel height and the dimension of backness and frontness.. A less common variation in vowel quality can be produced by a change in the shape of the front of the tongue, resulting in a rhotic or rhotacized vowel. \nThe lips play a major role in vowel articulation. It is generally believed that two major variables are in effect: lip-rounding (or labialization) and lip protrusion.\n\nFor all practical purposes, temperature can be treated as constant in the articulatory system. Thus, Boyle's Law can usefully be written\nas the following two equations.\n\nWhat the above equations express is that given an initial pressure \"P\" and volume \"V\" at time 1 the product of these two values will be equal to the product of the pressure \"P\" and volume \"V\" at a later time 2. This means that if there is an increase in the volume of cavity, there will be a corresponding decrease in pressure of that same cavity, and vice versa. In other words, volume and pressure are inversely proportional (or negatively correlated) to each other. As applied to a description of the subglottal cavity, when the lung pistons contract the lungs, the volume of the subglottal cavity decreases while the subglottal air pressure increases. Conversely, if the lungs are expanded, the pressure decreases.\n\nA situation can be considered where (1) the vocal fold valve is closed separating the supraglottal cavity from the subglottal cavity, (2) the mouth is open and, therefore, supraglottal air pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure, and (3) the lungs are contracted resulting in a subglottal pressure that has increased to a pressure that is greater than atmospheric pressure. If the vocal fold valve is subsequently opened, the previously two separate cavities become one unified cavity although the cavities will still be aerodynamically isolated because the glottic valve between them is relatively small and constrictive. Pascal's Law states that the pressure within a system must be equal throughout the system. When the subglottal pressure is greater than supraglottal pressure, there is a pressure inequality in the unified cavity. Since pressure is a force applied to a surface area by definition and a force is the product of mass and acceleration according to Newton's Second Law of Motion, the pressure inequality will be resolved by having part of the mass in air molecules found in the subglottal cavity move to the supraglottal cavity. This movement of mass is airflow. The airflow will continue until a pressure equilibrium is reached. Similarly, in an ejective consonant with a glottalic airstream mechanism, the lips or the tongue (i.e., the buccal or lingual valve) are initially closed and the closed glottis (the laryngeal piston) is raised decreasing the oral cavity volume behind the valve closure and increasing the pressure compared to the volume and pressure at a resting state. When the closed valve is opened, airflow will result from the cavity behind the initial closure outward until intraoral pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure. That is, air will flow from a cavity of higher pressure to a cavity of lower pressure until the equilibrium point; the pressure as potential energy is, thus, converted into airflow as kinetic energy.\n\nSound sources refer to the conversion of aerodynamic energy into acoustic energy. There are two main types of sound sources in the articulatory system: periodic (or more precisely semi-periodic) and aperiodic. A periodic sound source is vocal fold vibration produced at the glottis found in vowels and voiced consonants. A less common periodic sound source is the vibration of an oral articulator like the tongue found in alveolar trills. Aperiodic sound sources are the turbulent noise of fricative consonants and the short-noise burst of plosive releases produced in the oral cavity.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to understand how sounds are made, experimental procedures are often adopted. Palatography is one of the oldest instrumental phonetic techniques used to record data regarding articulators. In traditional, static palatography, a speaker's palate is coated with a dark powder. The speaker then produces a word, usually with a single consonant. The tongue wipes away some of the powder at the place of articulation. The experimenter can then use a mirror to photograph the entire upper surface of the speaker's mouth. This photograph, in which the place of articulation can be seen as the area where the powder has been removed, is called a palatogram.\n\nTechnology has since made possible electropalatography (or EPG). In order to collect EPG data, the speaker is fitted with a special prosthetic palate, which contains a number of electrodes. The way in which the electrodes are \"contacted\" by the tongue during speech provides phoneticians with important information, such as how much of the palate is contacted in different speech sounds, or which regions of the palate are contacted, or what the duration of the contact is.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2297050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2297050", "title": "Battir", "text": "Battir\n\nBattir () is a Palestinian village in the West Bank, 6.4 km west of Bethlehem, and southwest of Jerusalem. It was inhabited during the Byzantine and Islamic periods, and in the Ottoman and British Mandate censuses its population was recorded as primarily Muslim. In former times, the city lay along the route from Jerusalem to Bayt Jibrin. Battir is situated just above the modern route of the Jaffa–Jerusalem railway, which served as the armistice line between Israel and Jordan from 1949 until the Six-Day War, when it was occupied by Israel. In 2007, Battir had a population of about 4,000.\n\nIn 2014, Battir was inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage Site, as \"Land of Olives and Vines — Cultural Landscape of Southern Jerusalem, Battir\".\n\nAncient Betar, whose name Battir preserves, was a second-century Jewish village and fortress, the site of the final battle of the Bar Kokhba revolt. The modern Palestinian village is built north east the ancient site \"Khirbet el-Yahud\" (Arabic, meaning \"ruin of the Jews\" ) and \"is unanimously identified with Betar, the last stronghold of the Second Revolt against the Romans, where its leader, Bar-Kokhba, found his death in 135 CE.\" \"A modern agricultural terrace follows the line of the ancient fortification wall\". There is a tradition that the village is also the site of the tomb of the Tannaic sage Eleazar of Modi'im.\n\nA mosaic from the late Byzantine or early Muslim period was found in Battir.\n\nIn 1596, Battir appeared in Ottoman tax registers as a village in the \"Nahiya\" of Quds in the \"Liwa\" of Quds. It had a population of 24 households and two bachelors, all Muslims, and paid taxes on wheat, summer crops or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 4,800 Akçe. All of the revenue went to a Waqf.\n\nIn 1838 it was noted as \"Bittir\", a Muslim village in the \"Beni Hasan\" district, west of Jerusalem.\n\nFrench explorer Victor Guérin visited the place in 1860s, while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Battir had a population of 239, in a total of 62 houses, though that population count included men, only. It was further noted that it had \"a beautiful spring flowing through the courtyard of the mosque\".\n\nThe Palestine Exploration Fund's \"Survey of Western Palestine\" in 1883 described Battir as a moderate sized village, on the precipitous slope of a deep valley.\n\nIn 1896 the population of \"Bettir\" was estimated to be about 750 persons.\n\nIn the 20th century, Battir's development was linked to its location alongside the railroad to Jerusalem, which provided access to the marketplace as well as income from passengers who disembarked to refresh themselves en route.\nIn the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Batir had an all Muslim population of 542 persons, increasing in the 1931 census to 758; 755 Muslims, two Christians and one Jew, in 172 houses.\n\nIn the 1945 statistics the population of Battir was 1,050, all Muslims, with a total of 8,028 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. Of this, 1,805 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 2,287 for cereals, while 73 dunams were built-up (urban) land.\n\nIn the wake of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Battir came under Jordanian rule.\n\nDuring the 1948 war, most of the villagers had fled, but Mustafa Hassan and a few others stayed. At night they would light candles in the houses, and in the morning they would take out the cattle. When nearing the village, the Israelis thought Battir was still inhabited and gave up attacking. The armistice line was drawn near the railroad, with Battir ending up just meters to the east of Jordan's border with Israel. At least 30% of Battir's land lies on the Israeli side of the Green Line, but the villagers were allowed to keep it in return for preventing damage to the railway, thus being the only Palestinians officially allowed to cross into Israel and work their lands before the Six-Day War.\n\nThe Jordanian census of 1961 found 1,321 inhabitants in Battir.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War in 1967, Battir came under Israeli occupation. The population in the 1967 census was 1445.\n\nSince the signing of the 1995 accords, it has been administered by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). Battir is governed by a village council currently administrated by nine members appointed by the PNA. 23.7% of Battir land is defined as Area B, while the remaining 76.3% was defined as Area C in the same accords.\n\nIn 2007, Battir had a population of 3,967, in 2012 the population was estimated at about 4,500.\n\nBattir is located 6.4 km (horizontal distance) north-west of Bethlehem on a hill above Wadi el-Jundi (lit. \"Valley of the Soldier\"), which runs southwest through the Judean hills to the coastal plain. The Palestine Exploration Fund's \"Survey of Western Palestine\" in 1883 described the city's natural defenses, saying its houses stand upon rock terraces, having a rocky scarp below; thus from the north the place is very strong, whilst on the south a narrow neck between two ravine heads connects the hill with the main ridge. At an altitude of around 760 m above sea level, Battir's summers are temperate, and its winters mild with occasional snowfall. The average annual temperature is 16 C.\n\nBattir has a unique irrigation system that utilizes man-made terraces and a system of manually diverting water via sluice gates. The Roman-era network is still in use, fed by seven springs which have provided fresh water for 2,000 years. The irrigation system runs through a steep valley near the Green Line where a section of the Ottoman-era Hejaz Railway was laid. Battir's eight main clans take turns each day to water the village's crops. Hence a local saying that in Battir \"a week lasts eight days, not seven.\" According to anthropologist Giovanni Sontana of UNESCO, \"There are few, if any, places left in the immediate region where such a traditional method of agriculture remains, not only intact, but as a functioning part of the village.\"\n\nIn 2007, the village of Battir sued the Israeli Defense Ministry to try to force them to change the planned route of the Israeli West Bank barrier which would cut through part of Battir's 2,000-year-old irrigation system, which is still in use. The Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA), which approved the fence’s original route in 2005, changed its mind and wrote in a 13-page policy paper that Battir’s terraces were also an Israeli heritage site and should be carefully safeguarded, stating that agricultural terraces around Battir attesting to millennia-old methods of farming in the region will be irreversibly harmed by the fence, no matter how narrow its route. It was the first time an Israeli government agency expressed opposition to the construction of a segment of the fence. This affidavit was one of four expert opinions that contended the fence would decimate the unique farming system, and in early May 2013, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the Defense Ministry must explain “why should the route of the separation barrier in the Battir village area not be nullified or changed, and alternately why should the barrier not be reconfigured.” The Defense Ministry has to submit a new plan for securing the border that will not destroy Battir by July 2, 2013. A separate petition against the separation barrier has also been filed by the nearby Jewish city Beitar Illit, fearing that it would prevent them from expanding the settlement.\n\nIn 2011 UNESCO awarded Battir a $15,000 prize for \"Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes\" due to its care for its ancient terraces and irrigation system.\n\nIn May 2012, the Palestinian National Authority sent a delegation to UNESCO headquarters in Paris to discuss the possibility of adding Battir to its World Heritage List. The PNA's deputy minister of tourism, Hamadan Taha, said that the organization wants to \"maintain it as a Palestinian and humanitarian heritage,\" making special note of its historic terraces and irrigation systems. the nomination of Battir was blocked at the last minute because the formal submission was too late. In a document concerning the damage the separation barrier would do to the area, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) noted \"The struggle of our neighbors to name the area a World Heritage Site places us in an embarrassing position, and we should work together with them to protect the landscape.\"\n\nIn January 2015, according to the village mayor Akram Badir, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the IDF request to build the separation barrier through the village \n\nAn old Roman bath fed by a spring is located in the middle of the village. Archaeologist D. Ussishkin dates the village to the Iron Age, and states that at the time of the Revolt it was a village of between one and two thousand people chosen by Bar Kochba for its spring, defensible hilltop location, and proximity to the main Jerusalem-Gaza road. A Roman inscription was also discovered near one of the city's natural springs on which are inscribed the names of the Fifth Macedonian Legion and the Eleventh Claudian Legion, which said legions presumably took part in the siege of the city during Emperor Hadrian's reign.\n\nThere isn't any evidence of habitation in the period immediately after the Revolt.\n\n\n"}

The film is part of the project \"Great Art Cinema\" and analyses one of the most mysterious works of Sandro Botticelli, the \"Map of Hell\" in the \"Divine Comedy Illustrated by Botticelli\" in the Vatican Library. The map was originally part of an illustrated manuscript of Dante's \"Divine Comedy\", featuring artwork by Botticcelli.\n\nThe film was edited in the facilities of TV Plus, Medea Film, and Nexo Digital. It attempts to shed light on Botticelli's motivation for drawing his \"Map of Hell\", and, in the process, to reveal the dark, and less well known, side of the Renaissance master who is famous for painting \"The Birth of Venus\" and \"Primavera\".\n\nBotticelli had created 102 drawings based on the writings of Dante's \"Inferno\" depicting Dante's vision of Hell. One of those drawings, the \"Map of Hell\", shows the suffering of the condemned souls at the various levels of Hell, is analysed by art experts and their conclusions are presented in the film. \n\nWhen the director of the film, Ralph Loop, saw Botticelli's exhibitions in Berlin and London in 2015, he became so fascinated with the \"Map of Hell\" that he decided to make a film about it. In Ron Howard's \"Inferno\", the \"Map of Hell\" is shown briefly as a projection on a wall, while Ralph Loop's film is dedicated to examining the map and its history in detail. \n\nThe film attempts to shed light on what motivated Botticelli to draw the \"Map of Hell\", and, in doing so, to reveal the dark, and less well known, side of the Renaissance master who is famous for painting \"The Birth of Venus\" and \"Primavera\".\n\nThe drawing is about 30 by 40 centimetres and in the film it is examined by a glove-wearing German art historian inside the air-conditioned vaults of the Vatican. A letter from Friedrich Lippmann, director of Kupferstichkabinett Berlin, who in 1882 brought 85 of Botticelli's 102 drawings to the museum, is also shown in the film. A high-performance digital scanner is used in the film to reveal details in the map which could not be discerned by the human eye.\n\nThe film was shot on location in the Vatican, the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, the Vatican Library, London, Berlin and Scotland.\n\n\"Die Zeit\" comments that the film is worth seeing \"as a background for the blockbuster [Ron Howard's film] – or instead.\" and further comments that Ron Howard's film only briefly shows a projection of the map, while in Ralph Loop's film the viewer can \"marvel at the miracle in detail\". The reviewer further asks \"A whole film about a darkly colored drawing of just 30 by 40 centimeters, centuries old – is not that terribly dry?\" concluding that \"In fact, the small film is not meant to provide new insights to art scientists. But it entertains us non-experts in the best possible [way] with the little material that can be filmed in this subject so we see shots of Florence and Rome...\". \"Die Zeit\" finally concludes, \"Anyone who can free himself from such perfectly overworked vision of hell, recognizes Botticelli's painting [for] what it still is: infernal[ly] good.\"\n\n\"Spielfilm.de\" comments that the film will be interesting to \"[a]lmost anyone who has a passion for exciting thriller costumes or unsolved secrets (the history of art and culture)\". The critic further comments \"[o]n the one hand, [Loop] provides a comprehensive insight into the time of Botticelli – at all times, friendly, and comprehensible. And also for cinema-goers, to whom Botticelli and his art so far were largely foreign.\" Concerning the technology employed to scan the map details, the reviewer remarks that \"[f]or the documentary \"Botticelli Inferno\", the [map] was illuminated with a high-performance scanner. This makes shading, coloring, details and hidden messages visible in an unprecedented way. Things that hitherto remained hidden from the eye.\" The review also mentions that the film employs a first-person narration technique, when referring to Botticelli, that makes the viewer feel close to the artist. The critic goes on to conclude that the film is: \"a masterly, artfully documented work of art, [about] one of the most mysterious works of art in history.\"\n\n\"AlloCiné\" comments that \"\"Botticelli – Inferno\" transports viewers into another world: a journey to the underworld through the nine levels of hell, as described by Dante. \"Only by traveling through hell and purgatory we can reach paradise and emerge to see the stars again\"\nDo not miss this unique event, specially created for cinema.\"\n\nThe film was released in Italy in November 2016.\n"}

Bride service and bride wealth models frame anthropological discussions of kinship in many regions of the world.\nPatterns of matrilocal post-marital residence, as well as the practice of temporary or prolonged bride service, have been widely reported for indigenous peoples of the Amazon basin. Among these people, bride service is frequently performed in conjunction with an interval of uxorilocal residence. The length of uxorilocal residence and the duration of bride service are contingent upon negotiations between the concerned parties, the outcome of which has been characterized as an enduring commitment or permanent debt. The power wielded by those who “give” wives over those who “take” them is also said to be a significant part of the political relationships in societies where bride service obligations are prevalent.\n\nRather than seeing affinity in terms of a \"compensation\" model whereby individuals are exchanged as objects, Dean’s (1995) research on Amazon bride service among the Urarina demonstrates how differentially situated subjects negotiate the politics of marriage.\nAn example of bride service occurs in the Hebrew Bible, , when Jacob labored for Laban for fourteen years to marry Rachel. Originally the deal was seven years, but Laban tricked Jacob by giving him Leah on their wedding day, so Jacob had to work another seven years to obtain the girl he had originally fallen in love with, Rachel.\n\n"}

The center has been exploring a methodology which can be referred to as \"Selective Global Comparison,\" an approach in which a relatively small number of unrelated languages are examined in depth in order to determine the nature of the variation which distinguishes them. This methodology is distinct from usual work in linguistic typology, which tends to compare many languages at a relatively superficial level of description, and from microcomparative studies, which tend to compare closely related languages at a level of great detail.\n\nAt any given time there are about twenty to twenty-five doctorate holding linguists working on CASTL-related projects in Tromsø. There are also twelve to fifteen PhD students and some number of Master's students. In addition, CASTL is the center of a broad international network of current linguistic research, for example as the administrative host of the NORMS project (a Nordic Center of Excellence in Microcomparative Scandinavian Syntax) and the EGG school and other international ventures.

Official spellings also vary by country or region, with some rejecting the American or British variants as incorrect for the region.\n\nWithin a particular field of study, such as computer graphics, other words might be more common for misspelling, such as \"pixel\" misspelled as \"pixle\" (or variants \"cesium\" and \"caesium\"). Sometimes words are purposely misspelled, as a form in slang, abbreviations, or in song lyrics, etc.\n\nIn general writing, some words are frequently misspelled, such as the incorrect spelling \"concensus\" for \"consensus\"\nfound in numerous webpages on the Internet. Other common misspellings include \"equiptment\" (for \"equipment\"),\n\"independant\" (for \"independent\"),\n\"readible\" (for \"readable\"),\nor \"usible\" (for \"usable\" or \"useable\").\nBecause many words can be extended with prefixes (such as \"un-\" or \"anti-\" or \"re-\") or suffixes (such as \"-ly\" or \"-ing\" or \"-ness\"), a comprehensive list of words prone to misspelling would contain thousands of variations from combining prefixes or suffixes (or both) added to the root words. To limit the scope to common words, the top 350 words are considered (according to various sources).\n\nThe following list, of about 350 words, is based on documented lists of the top 100, 200, or 400 most commonly misspelled words in all variants of the English language, rather than listing every conceivable misspelled word. Each word is followed by examples of misspellings:\n\n\nMispronunciation is known to be one of the most common causes of misspelling.\nHence, phonetic misspelling is common, once a word is mispronounced. For example, the word \"realize\" may be misspelled as \"relize\".\n\nSome spelling errors are introduced because the typing of certain people is not perfect, such as\nSome of the errors listed may be due to mistyping rather than ignorance, for example \"solider\" for \"soldier\".\n\nThese misspellings rarely happen in handwritten text.\n\nTwo (or more) differently spelt words with different meanings are homophones if they are nonetheless pronounced the same; e.g., \"right\", \"rite\", \"wright\", and \"write\"; \"read\" (most tenses of verb) and \"reed\"; \"read\" (past, past participle) and \"red\". This list includes only a few homophones although incorrect use of homophones is a very common error; the following words from the list are all good English words, though often incorrectly used in place of their homophones:\n\nSpell checkers do not detect incorrect use of homophones.\n\nPersonal names and surnames may be pronounced like a standard English word, but with different spelling: \"balance\" and \"John Ballance\"; \"war\" and \"Evelyn Waugh\"; \"marshal\" and \"George Marshall\". Personal names do, of course, generally start with a capital letter.\n\nA misspelling in English might be made by someone used to a different spelling in another language; for example, \"address\" is translated \"adresse\" in French and German. Many Spanish words are similar or identical to English words, but with an \"n\" inserted, or replacing an \"m\", leading to errors: \"inmigrant\" from \"inmigrante\", \"cementery\" from \"cementerio\", \"confortable\". The English word 'loose' reasonably looks like it should be pronounced as 'lose' to Germans, as in German the lone 's' often has the sound of an English 'z', and a lone 'o' in English very seldom has the 'oo' sound.\n\nThere can be confusion over a plural possessive form. If the singular is \"book's title\" and the plural \"books' titles\", the latter can appear as \"book's\", or even \"books's\". The plural can be written with an erroneous apostrophe (\"grocer's apostrophe\" in Britain): \"apple's and pear's\". Elision can lead to misspelling: \"doesn't\", where the apostrophe represents the elided \"o\", can be misspelled \"does'nt\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53897610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53897610", "title": "Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles", "text": "Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles\n\nConcerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles (CCSCLA) is a non-profit 501(c)3 community-based organization whose mission is to work for social justice and economic and environmental change within the South Central community. CCSCLA works to involve community members in identifying social, economic, and environmental areas of concern to them, and give them the tools necessary to engage with institutions, such as industries or political leaders, to enact change.\n\nThe designation of 501(c)3 signifies the organization’s area of concentration. This area consists of the Santa Monica freeway to the North, the Harbor Freeway to the West, Slauson Avenue to the South and Alameda to the East. It includes the Vermont Central neighborhood and Central Avenue Corridor. Since its founding, CCSCLA has expanded its work into other low-income neighborhoods, including Watts and Compton. At the time of its founding, CCSCLA’s area of concentration had one of the highest populations of African Americans in Los Angeles.\n\nCCSCLA felt it needed to develop a base in order to enact substantial change. Starting in 1990, they began to organize block clubs throughout the Vernon-Central Area. To date, CCSCLA has been able to organize 57 block clubs. The primary issue of concern among all block clubs is the conditions of streets. Alleys in CCSCLA’s area of concern were considered to be the worst in Los Angeles in the organization's beginning stages.\n\nThe Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles was founded in 1985 by Robin Cannon and Charlotte Bullock in order to form a group to protest the construction of a waste incinerator known as the LANCER within the predominately low income, colored community. By 1987, its construction was successfully thwarted protests by the CCSCLA being large contributing factor to the decision. \n\nSince dismantling the LANCER, CCSCLA has broadened its mission, fighting to better the communities of South Central LA with a number of programs that still exist today. This includes campaigns fighting against environmental hazards in the community, alleyway clean ups, affordable housing projects, and youth programs. \nBorn from the recognition that environmental hazards are unequally distributed across the United States (poor and colored communities in close proximity, and richer and white communities safely farther away) the Environmental Justice movement seeks to draw attention to and rectify these harms. This understanding, that poor and colored communities are disproportionately being exposed to environmental hazards, has been brought about by dozens of studies completed in the last thirty years. Environmental Justice as a political movement is constituted of events and strategies aimed at achieving social and economic justice in regards to the environmental hazards plaguing marginalized communities. President Bill Clinton’s Executive Order 12898 on Environmental Justice in 1994 adopted the work of the movement and created federal government policy. The order required federal agencies to work to identify and address “disproportionately high adverse health or environmental effects of their policies on low-income people and people of color.” and “look for ways to prevent discrimination by race, color or national origin in any federally funded programs dealing with health or the environment.” Despite the recognition of the federal government and the adoption of the theories developed in response to the Environmental Justice Movement, the movement itself is largely characterized by grassroots activism.\n\nCommunity based groups are fighting specifically against environmental hazards that are placed in close proximity to their communities that have negative health effects on their surrounding populations. CCSCLA is cited as a defining community activist group for the movement. CCSCLA set an example on how to mobilize a marginalized community by forming coalitions and networking within their affected community. In this way CCSCLA was able to organize local business owners, lawyers, and legislators into a collective force invested in fighting for environmental justice. CCSCLA first mobilized in response to the proposed construction of the LANCER incinerator, and were pushed to use this community based approach because of the denial of support from mainstream environmental groups (MEGs). The Sierra Club and Environmental Defense Fund specifically refused to aid CCSCLA because CCSCLA was dealing with “a community health issue, not an environmental one.” Fueling this dismissal of a request for aid was the neglect of MEGs to acknowledge the theoretical understandings of the Environmental Justice Movement- that \"social inequality and imbalances of power are at the heart of environmental degradation resource depletion pollution and even overpopulation.\" CCSCLA continues to affect community change today and in doing so they continue to challenge the narrow definition of environment that is currently utilized by many MEGs. CCSCLA accomplishes this by focusing on the intersectionality of race, concentrated poverty, social isolation, and environmental health. CCSCLA comments on what the \"environment\" entails for them: \"CCSCLA realize that the environment consists of more than just hazardous waste, chemicals, and air quality control; our environment is also the quality of our housing stock, the conditions of our schools and the safety of our neighborhoods\"\n\nIt is CCSCLA's belief that empowering and growing the community of South Central Los Angeles both economically and socially will in turn better the environmental conditions of the area. Their involvement in providing and protecting affordable housing started with their fight against the demolition of affordable housing for the construction of a school. They won the case and went on to start sponsoring and constructing affordable housing developments. CCSCLA is able to not only provide affordable housing units, but they also employ community members and local businesses during the construction and set up community programs within the developments.\n\nCCSCLA invests in educating and benefiting the youth populations of South Central Los Angeles. Training and cultivating the youth population of the community is important for its sustainability. CCSCLA not only provides programs for youth recreation, but also education on the community issues, and programs for professional development. The most notable programs CCSCLA has created are: People Organizing for Workplace and Environmental Rights (POWER), The Entertainment Industry Training Program (EITP), and The Antes Columbus Youth Football Club in partnership with the Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches.\n\nThrough its dealings and defeat of the LANCER project, CCSCLA members realized that there is more to the environment than just hazardous waste, chemicals, and air quality control- \"our environment is also the quality of our housing stock, the conditions of our schools and the safety of our neighborhoods. All of these factors effect how we are able to happily co-exist in the same community.\"\n\nCCSCLA continues to work on environmental issues such as recycling, the cleaning of alleyways and streets, childhood lead poisoning prevention, storm drain protection, used motor oil recycling, teen worker rights, among others affecting community members' quality of life.\n\nCCSCLA states that they will conduct further environmental awareness workshops within communities as the need and topics for them present themselves.\n\nThe environmental justice issues which CCSCLA is involved in raise several concerns along the lines of public health. Because of the close proximity of developments such as incinerators, plants, and/or factories to places in which people live in south central LA, residents are at increased risk of developing health problems relating to prolonged exposure to pollution and toxins.\n\nPart of CCSCLA's work within the community is to raise awareness and promote community engagement of environmental justice issues—this involves not only environmental upkeep and well being, but the health of residents in these communities as well. CCSCLA hopes that in spreading awareness, health literacy will increase within communities involved.\n\nIn the summer of 1985, Robin Cannon and Charlotte Bullock established CCSCLA is response to the proposed construction of the Los Angeles City Energy Recovery (LANCER) municipal waste incinerator. The waste facility would burn million of tons of waste during its operation causing concern for citizens of the pollutants that would be emitted. Cannon and Bullock were concerned South Central Los Angeles was chosen for the incinerator’s location because of the community's high unemployment rate, low average income, and high population of people of color. The LANCER was to be built in a vacant lot, near Jefferson High School and a public recreation center in a residential area of 16,000 people. LANCER was estimated to cost $170 million to construct. According to The Los Angeles Times, facility would employ highly trained and specialized personnel that would mostly live outside of the community so its construct would not provide jobs for those living near LANCER. In June 1987, Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley announced that the LANCER project would not be completed.\n\nFabiola Tostado, Maria Perez, and Nevada Dove, three teenage students living in south central Los Angeles, stood up to protest the development and opening of Jefferson New Middle School, a new school planned to be built in their community. The school was projected to open in 1997—the students were able to hold off its opening until 1998, and also shed light on many problems existing with the school’s location.\n\nAccording to the research the teens did, the building site of the school was located on toxic land and was to be placed across from a former plant which was put on the Superfund cleanup list. Melanie Dove, mother of one of the teens Nevada Dove, was an organizer of Concerned Citizens of South-Central LA at the time, contributing to CCSCLA’s involvement in the situation. The teens’ actions raised public awareness of the build on toxic land, and brought to light discrepancies in the building company’s plans. As a result, a new law was put into place which became effective January 1, 2000, stating: “henceforth, all school sites will be fully evaluated and made safe before school construction ever begins”. The Concerned Citizens helped shed light on over 12 other school sites around Los Angeles suffering from similar problems of officials’ oversight in constructing in polluted zones. Their efforts garnered the attention of their senator at the time, Tom Hayden (D- Los Angeles), who involved himself with the problem of building schools on contaminated grounds on a federal level.\n\nThe issue of building on polluted land is far from solved- the teenagers explained that students ended up attending the community middle school even after concerns were voiced, and experienced symptoms of the pollution negatively affecting their health. In this instance, they were not able to stop the LA Unified School District from the building of Jefferson New Middle School, but their influence extended beyond this instance. This situation brought the movement of environmental justice to light within the south central LA community, and set an empowering example for young people to have the ability to educate themselves and stand up to federal officials ignoring their concerns.\n\nAlleys in CCSCLA’s area of concern were considered to be the worst in Los Angeles around the time of its founding. They are used for illegal trash dumping, sites for drug trafficking and crime, and have little to no lighting. Block club participants submitted a petition to the city of Los Angeles demanding that alleys be cleaned, closed to traffic, and fenced off with access only to residents of these communities. This petition resulted in alley clean ups and closures that prevent crime and illegal dumping. CCSCLA also entered into a pilot program with the city of Los Angeles to train community residents, including those formerly incarcerated, to do alley clean up and pothole repair. Fifteen community residents were ultimately given full-time, permanent employment through this pilot program.\n\nPOWER, or People Organizing for Workplace and Environmental Rights, is a youth program sponsored by CCSCLA sine May 1998. POWER is a joint program between Jefferson High School, Fremont High School, and the University of California at Los Angeles- Labor Occupational Safety and Health. CCSCLA worked in conjunction with UCLA-LOSH to create the program curriculum to effectively educate the students on the issues facing their community and to give them the skills to translate the environmental education they receive to action in the community. It is CCSCLA's aim to empower students to take charge of and be responsible for their neighborhood, workplace, school, and home. A notable achievement of the program was the forced closure of a contaminated school site for the entirety of a year while environmental remediation was conducted. The youth received national acclaim for their efforts in TIME Magazine which published an article titled \"Don’t Mess Around with the Toxic Crusaders\".\n\nACYFC, founded through a partnership between CCSCLA and Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches (LMC) is an effort to bring the community together and provide a positive extracurricular activity for youth. For ages 5–19, the ACYFC provides uniforms, equipment, and team organization with no cost to the players. Taking the club a step further, CCSCLA also implemented training programs for sports related business and jobs including: venue management, broadcast recording and editing, concessions management, referee training, league administration, and manufacturing and retail of uniforms. In addition, CCSCLA has been able to provide two synthetic soccer fields for play in the Vernon Central community. In 2002 CCSCLA helped facilitate the Nike donation of a synthetic field to Ross Snyder Park and facilitated the collection of resources to develop a field for George Washington Carver Middle School.\n\nBeginning in 1997, the mission of EITP is to get inner city kids (ages 13–18) acquainted with jobs in the entertainment industry. Kids work with professionals from the industry on a television or film project during workshops twice a week. Topics of the workshops include: producing, writing, directing, set design, production management, location scouting, props, music composing, hair and make-up design, wardrobe, art directing, script supervision, stage direction, camera operation, and video editing etc. Notable projects produced in the past include: public service announcement- “Choices”, music video for a neighborhood teen, POWER Youth Documentary, and Fame 2000- stage direction and video taping. The EITP program had been partially sponsored by DreamWorks SKG and Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\nPollution created from LANCER and like projects has severely affected the health of members of South Central Los Angeles communities. Inhabitants of these communities are largely racial and/or ethnic minorities of low-income. Mothers in these communities explain that they and their children already face pre-existing health conditions unable to be addressed because of the cost and accessibility of the current healthcare system—conditions such as asthma, influenza, cancer, heart disease, and/or pneumonia. Ailments of community members are magnified through added health problems caused by pollution in the environment of south-central inhabitants (such as trash-burning from incinerators, chemical exposure from power plants, etc.).\n\nIn April 2014 the Juanita Tate Marketplace opened in Southern Los Angeles in honor of the late Juanita Tate, a member of CCSCLA. The shopping center took nearly two decades to build because of the area's prior neglect. The retail shopping center is built on a brownfield that was formerly a scrap yard and recycling center. In April 2015 the marketplace was sold to private investors.\n"}

It creates a list of citizens who are banned from entering Russia, and also allows the government to freeze their assets and investments. The law suspends the activity of politically active non-profit organisations which receive money from American citizens or organisations. It also bans citizens of the United States from adopting children from Russia. The law was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on 28 December 2012 and took effect on 1 January 2013. The law is informally named after a Russian orphan adopted by a family from Purcellville, Virginia, who died of heat stroke after being left in a parked car for nine hours. The law is described as a response to the Magnitsky Act in the United States, which places sanctions on Russian officials who were involved in a tax scandal exposed by Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky against Russian officials; Magnitsky was later found to have been handcuffed and tortured while in jail.\n\nThe bill was proposed by \"United Russia\" deputy . The bill passed the State Duma on 21 December 2012 and the Federation Council on 27 December 2012.\n\nIn Duma in first reading one was against (Ilya Ponomarev); in second reading 4 against (Ilya Ponomarev, Dmitry Gudkov, Valery Zubov, Sergei Petrov - all from \"A Just Russia\" faction); in third and last reading - 8 against (same plus Andrei Ozerov from \"A Just Russia\", Oleg Smolin and Zhores Alferov from Communist Party of Russia, Boris Reznik from \"United Russia\"). In Federation Council just one against - Larisa Ponomareva (mother of Ilya Ponomarev).\n\nThe United States Department of State said in a press release that it \"deeply regret Russia’s passage of a law ending inter-country adoptions between the United States and Russia\". United States Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul said that the law will \"link the fate of orphaned children to unrelated political issues.\"\n\nIn the State Duma, the law was informally named after Dima Yakovlev (born Dmitry Yakovlev), a Russian toddler who was adopted by Miles Harrison of Virginia. The child was renamed Chase Harrison while in America. In July 2008, less than three months after he arrived in America, Dima died while he was strapped into his adoptive father's car. He had been left alone for nine hours in the car as his father had forgotten to take him to daycare service.\n\nFollowing trial, Harrison was acquitted of involuntary manslaughter by a Circuit Court judge in Fairfax County, Virginia, on January 2009. The case became national news in Russia, highlighting abuse cases involving Russian children adopted by American parents. Following the child's death, Russian federal prosecutors opened an investigation into the circumstances of the incident, while Russian authorities called to restrict or end the adoption of Russian children by Americans.\n\nOn 28 December 2012, Governor of Pskov Oblast Andrei Turchak suspended two officials pending an investigation into their roles in the adoption of Dima Yakovlev.\n\nRussian human rights ombudsman Vladimir Lukin said that the law will be contested in Russian constitutional courts.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church supports the law. Church spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin said that the orphans adopted by American citizens \"won't get a truly Christian upbringing and that means falling away from the Church and from the path to eternal life, in God's kingdom\". According to the independent \"Moscow Times\", the ban has grown increasingly popular among the Russian public.\n\nThe U.S. media outlets \"Christian Science Monitor\", \"Fox News\", \"The Daily Beast\", \"Time\", and a local Houston, Texas, media affiliate criticised the move. The British newspaper \"The Guardian\" commented on the law that it is \"not about children's rights\" and \"ruins lives and leaves both countries looking sordid.\" Due to the law being signed on the day many Christians mark as the Massacre of the Innocents, the law has been referred to by the \"Economist\" as \"Herod’s law\" and \"cannibalistic\".\n\nAmnesty International called the law \"in no one's best interest\" and have called for Russian parliamentarians to reject the law. Human Rights Watch Europe and Central Asia director Hugh Williamson said that the law \"could deprive them (Russian orphans) of the loving families they desperately need.\"\n\nOn 14 January 2013, about 20,000 people marched against the law in Moscow. Russian Chief Rabbi Berel Lazar said that \"Russian orphans should not become the hostages of politics\".\n\nFrom 1991 to 2010, over 50,000 Russian orphans had been adopted in the United States; however, according to \"Time magazine\", U.S. adoptions of Russian children had already fell by two-thirds from 2004 to 2009. At the time of the 2012 ban, over one thousand prospective adoptions were in progress. Among these prospective adoptions were about 200 Russian orphans who had already been told they were to be adopted. In January 2017, the European Court of Human Rights levied a fine on Russia, stating that the ban unlawfully discriminates on the basis of nationality.\n\n"}
{"id": "78689", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78689", "title": "Egyptology", "text": "Egyptology\n\nEgyptology (from \"Egypt\" and Greek , \"-logia\". ) is the study of ancient Egyptian history, language, literature, religion, architecture and art from the 5th millennium BC until the end of its native religious practices in the 4th century AD. A practitioner of the discipline is an \"Egyptologist\". In Europe, particularly on the Continent, Egyptology is primarily regarded as being a philological discipline, while in North America it is often regarded as a branch of archaeology.\n\nThe first explorers were the ancient Egyptians themselves. Thutmose IV restored the Sphinx and had the dream that inspired his restoration carved on the famous Dream Stele. Less than two centuries later, Prince Khaemweset, fourth son of Ramesses II, is famed for identifying and restoring historic buildings, tombs and temples including the pyramid.\n\nSome of the first historical accounts of Egypt were given by Herodotus, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus and the largely lost work of Manetho, an Egyptian priest, during the reign of Ptolemy I and Ptolemy II in the 3rd century BC. The Ptolemies were much interested in the work of the ancient Egyptians, and many of the Egyptian monuments, including the pyramids, were restored by them (although they built many new temples in the Egyptian style). The Romans also carried out restoration work in Egypt.\n\nThroughout the Middle Ages travelers on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land would occasionally deviate to visit sites within Egypt, which would include Cairo and its environs, where the Holy Family was thought to have fled, and the great Pyramids, which were thought to be Joseph's Granaries, built by the Hebrew patriarch to store grain during the years of plenty. A number of their accounts (\"Itineraria\") have survived and offer insights as to conditions in their respective time periods.\n\nAbdul Latif al-Baghdadi, a teacher at Cairo's Al-Azhar University in the 13th century, wrote detailed descriptions on ancient Egyptian monuments. Similarly, the 15th-century Egyptian historian al-Maqrizi wrote detailed accounts of Egyptian antiquities.\n\nEuropean exploration and travel writings of ancient Egypt commenced from the 13th century onward, with only occasional detours into a more scientific approach, notably by Claude Sicard, Benoît de Maillet, Frederic Louis Norden and Richard Pococke. In the early 17th century, John Greaves measured the pyramids, having inspected the broken Obelisk of Domitian in Rome, then destined for the Earl of Arundel's collection in London. He went on to publish the illustrated \"Pyramidographia\" in 1646, while the Jesuit scientist-priest Athanasius Kircher was perhaps the first to hint at the phonetic importance of Egyptian hieroglyphs, demonstrating Coptic as a vestige of early Egyptian, for which he is considered a \"founder\" of Egyptology. In the late 18th century, with Napoleon's scholars' recording of Egyptian flora, fauna and history (published as \"Description de l'Egypte\"), the study of many aspects of ancient Egypt became more scientifically oriented. The British captured Egypt from the French and gained the Rosetta Stone. Modern Egyptology is generally perceived as beginning about 1822.\n\nEgyptology's modern history begins with the invasion of Egypt by Napoleon Bonaparte. The subsequent publication of Description de l'Égypte between 1809 and 1829 made numerous ancient Egyptian source materials available to Europeans for the first time. Jean-François Champollion, Thomas Young and Ippolito Rosellini were some of the first Egyptologists of wide acclaim. The German Karl Richard Lepsius was an early participant in the investigations of Egypt; mapping, excavating, and recording several sites. Champollion announced his general decipherment of the system of Egyptian hieroglyphics for the first time, employing the Rosetta Stone as his primary aid. The Stone's decipherment was a very important development of Egyptology. With subsequently ever-increasing knowledge of Egyptian writing and language, the study of Ancient Egyptian civilization was able to proceed with greater academic rigour and with all the added impetus that comprehension of the written sources was able to engender. Egyptology became more professional via work of William Matthew Flinders Petrie, among others. Petrie introduced techniques of field preservation, recording, and excavating. Howard Carter's expedition brought much acclaim to the field of Egyptology. Many highly educated amateurs now also travelled to Egypt, however, including women such as Harriet Martineau and Florence Nightingale, who both left accounts of their travels, which revealed learned familiarity with all the latest European Egyptology.\n\nIn the modern era, the Ministry of State for Antiquities controls excavation permits for Egyptologists to conduct their work. The field can now use geophysical methods and other applications of modern sensing techniques to further Egyptology.\n\nEgyptology was established as an academic discipline through the research of Emmanuel de Rougé in France, Samuel Birch in England, and Heinrich Brugsch in Germany. In 1880, Flinders Petrie, another British Egyptologist, revolutionized the field of archaeology through controlled and scientifically recorded excavations. Petrie's work determined that Egyptian culture dated back as early as 4500 BC. The British Egypt Exploration Fund founded in 1882 and other Egyptologists promoted Petrie's methods. Other scholars worked on producing a hieroglyphic dictionary, developing a Demotic lexicon, and establishing an outline of ancient Egyptian history.\n\nIn the United States, the founding of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago and the expedition of James Henry Breasted to Egypt and Nubia established Egyptology as a legitimate field of study. In 1924, Breasted also started the Epigraphic Survey with the goal of making and publishing accurate copies of monuments. In the late 19th and early 20th century the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the University of Pennsylvania; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Brooklyn Institute of Fine Arts; and the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University also conducted \nexcavations in Egypt, expanding American collections.\n\nSome universities and colleges offer degrees in Egyptology. In the United States, these include the University of Chicago, Brown University, New York University, Yale University and Indiana University - Bloomington. There are also many programmes in the United Kingdom, including those at the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Swansea University, the University of Liverpool, and the University of London.

{"id": "11081176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11081176", "title": "Mind–body problem", "text": "Mind–body problem\n\nThe mind–body problem is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically since that question presupposes an interactionist account of mind-body relations. This question arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.\n\nThe problem was addressed by René Descartes in the 17th century, resulting in Cartesian dualism, and by pre-Aristotelian philosophers, in Avicennian philosophy, and in earlier Asian traditions. A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either dualist or monist. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. Monism maintains that there is only one unifying reality, substance or essence in terms of which everything can be explained.\n\nEach of these categories contain numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are substance dualism, which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and property dualism, which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are physicalism, which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; idealism, which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely an illusion; and neutral monism, which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. Psychophysical parallelism is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).\n\nSeveral philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The historical materialism of Karl Marx and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment. An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French structuralism, and is a position that generally characterized post-war Continental philosophy.\n\nThe absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly in the fields of sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology, and the neurosciences.\n\nAn ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena. Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual’s mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.\n\nPhilosophers David L. Robb and John F. Heil introduce mental causation in terms of the mind–body problem of interaction:\nContemporary neurophilosopher Georg Northoff suggests that mental causation is compatible with classical formal and final causality.\n\nBiologist, theoretical neuroscientist and philosopher, Walter J. Freeman, suggests that explaining mind–body interaction in terms of \"circular causation\" is more relevant than linear causation.\n\nIn neuroscience, much has been learned about correlations between brain activity and subjective, conscious experiences. Many suggest that neuroscience will ultimately explain consciousness:\n\"...consciousness is a biological process that will eventually be explained in terms of molecular signaling pathways used by interacting populations of nerve cells...\" However, this view has been criticized because \"consciousness\" has yet to be shown to be a \"process\", and the \"hard problem\" of relating consciousness directly to brain activity remains elusive.\n\nThe \"neural correlates of consciousness\" \"are the smallest set of brain mechanisms and events sufficient for some specific conscious feeling, as elemental as the color red or as complex as the sensual, mysterious, and primeval sensation evoked when looking at [a] jungle scene...\" Neuroscientists use empirical approaches to discover neural correlates of subjective phenomena.\n\nA science of consciousness must explain the exact relationship between subjective conscious mental states and brain states formed by electrochemical interactions in the body, the so-called hard problem of consciousness. \nNeurobiology studies the connection scientifically, as do neuropsychology and neuropsychiatry. \"Neurophilosophy\" is the interdisciplinary study of neuroscience and philosophy of mind. In this pursuit, neurophilosophers, such as Patricia Churchland,\nPaul Churchland \nand Daniel Dennett, \nhave focused primarily on the body rather than the mind. In this context, neuronal correlates may be viewed as causing consciousness, where consciousness can be thought of as an undefined property that depends upon this complex, adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system. However, it's unknown if discovering and characterizing neural correlates may eventually provide a theory of consciousness that can explain the first-person experience of these \"systems\", and determine whether other systems of equal complexity lack such features.\n\nThe massive parallelism of neural networks allows redundant populations of neurons to mediate the same or similar percepts. Nonetheless, it is assumed that every subjective state will have associated neural correlates, which can be manipulated to artificially inhibit or induce the subject's experience of that conscious state. The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools was achieved by the development of behavioral and organic models that are amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. Non-human analysis such as this, in combination with imaging of the human brain, have contributed to a robust and increasingly predictive theoretical framework.\n\nThere are two common but distinct dimensions of the term \"consciousness\", one involving \"arousal\" and \"states of consciousness\" and the other involving \"content of consciousness\" and \"conscious states\". To be conscious \"of\" something, the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called \"vigilance\"), whether awake or in REM sleep. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a circadian rhythm but these natural cycles may be influenced by lack of sleep, alcohol and other drugs, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude required to trigger a given reaction (for example, the sound level that causes a subject to turn and look toward the source). High arousal states involve conscious states that feature specific perceptual content, planning and recollection or even fantasy. Clinicians use scoring systems such as the Glasgow Coma Scale to assess the level of arousal in patients with \"impaired states of consciousness\" such as the comatose state, the persistent vegetative state, and the minimally conscious state. Here, \"state\" refers to different amounts of externalized, physical consciousness: ranging from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and general anesthesia, to a fluctuating, minimally conscious state, such as sleep walking and epileptic seizure.\n\nMany nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the thalamus, midbrain and pons must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in the cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the amygdala, thalamus, claustrum and the basal ganglia.\n\nThe following is a very brief account of some contributions to the mind–body problem.\n\nThe Buddha (480–400 B.C.E), founder of Buddhism, described the mind and the body as depending on each other in a way that two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another and taught that the world consists of mind and matter which work together, interdependently. Buddhist teachings describe the mind as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream. The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws. The Buddhist practice of mindfulness involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.\n\nUltimately, the Buddha's philosophy is that both mind and forms are conditionally arising qualities of an ever-changing universe in which, when nirvāna is attained, all phenomenal experience ceases to exist. According to the anattā doctrine of the Buddha, the conceptual self is a mere mental construct of an individual entity and is basically an impermanent illusion, sustained by form, sensation, perception, thought and consciousness. The Buddha argued that mentally clinging to any views will result in delusion and stress, since, according to the Buddha, a real self (conceptual self, being the basis of standpoints and views) cannot be found when the mind has clarity.\n\nPlato (429–347 B.C.E.) believed that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality that consists of concepts he called Forms. According to Plato, objects in our everyday world \"participate in\" these Forms, which confer identity and meaning to material objects. For example, a circle drawn in the sand would be a circle only because it participates in the concept of an ideal circle that exists somewhere in the world of Forms. He argued that, as the body is from the material world, the soul is from the world of Forms and is thus immortal. He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death, when it would return to the world of Forms. Since the soul does not exist in time and space, as the body does, it can access universal truths. For Plato, ideas (or Forms) are the true reality, and are experienced by the soul. The body is for Plato empty in that it can not access the abstract reality of the world; it can only experience shadows. This is determined by Plato's essentially rationalistic epistemology.\n\nFor Aristotle (384–322 BC) \"mind\" is a faculty of the \"soul\". Regarding the soul, he said:\nIn the end, Aristotle saw the relation between soul and body as uncomplicated, in the same way that it is uncomplicated that a cubical shape is a property of a toy building block. The soul is a property exhibited by the body, one among many. Moreover, Aristotle proposed that when the body perishes, so does the soul, just as the shape of a building block disappears with destruction of the block.\n\nIn religious philosophy of Eastern monotheism, dualism denotes a binary opposition of an idea that contains two essential parts. The first formal concept of a \"mind-body\" split may be found in the \"divinity - secularity\" dualism of the ancient Persian religion of Zoroastrianism around the mid-fifth century BC. Gnosticism is a modern name for a variety of ancient dualistic ideas inspired by Judaism popular in the first and second century AD. These ideas later seem to have been incorporated into Galen's \"tripartite soul\" that led into both the Christian sentiments expressed in the later Augustinian theodicy and Avicenna’s Platonism in Islamic Philosophy.\n\nLike Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) believed that the mind and the body are one, like the seal and the wax are one, and it is therefore pointless to ask whether they are one. However, (referring to \"mind\" as \"the soul\") he asserted that the soul persists after the death of the body in spite of their unity, calling the soul \"this particular thing\". Since his view was primarily theological rather than philosophical, it is impossible to fit it neatly within either the category of physicalist or dualist.\n\nRené Descartes (1596–1650) believed that mind exerted control over the brain \"via\" the pineal gland:\nHis posited relation between mind and body is called Cartesian dualism or substance dualism. He held that \"mind\" was distinct from \"matter\", but could influence matter. How such an interaction could be exerted remains a contentious issue.\n\nFor Kant (1724–1804) beyond \"mind\" and \"matter\" there exists a world of \"a priori\" forms, which are seen as necessary preconditions for understanding. Some of these forms, space and time being examples, today seem to be pre-programmed in the brain.\n\nKant views the mind–body interaction as taking place through forces that may be of different kinds for mind and body.\n\nFor Huxley (1825–1895) the conscious mind was a by-product of the brain that has no influence upon the brain, a so-called epiphenomenon.\n\nA. N. Whitehead advocated a sophisticated form of panpsychism that has been called by David Ray Griffin \"panexperientialism\".\n\nFor Popper (1902–1994) there are \"three\" aspects of the mind–body problem: the worlds of matter, mind, and of the creations of the mind, such as mathematics. In his view, the third-world creations of the mind could be interpreted by the second-world mind and used to affect the first-world of matter. An example might be radio, an example of the interpretation of the third-world (Maxwell's electromagnetic theory) by the second-world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world.\n\nFor Searle (b. 1932) the mind–body problem is a false dichotomy; that is, mind is a perfectly ordinary aspect of the brain. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "604749", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=604749", "title": "Morphosyntactic alignment", "text": "Morphosyntactic alignment\n\nIn linguistics, morphosyntactic alignment is the grammatical relationship between arguments—specifically, between the two arguments (in English, subject and object) of transitive verbs like \"the dog chased the cat\", and the single argument of intransitive verbs like \"the cat ran away\". English has a \"subject,\" which merges the more active argument of transitive verbs with the argument of intransitive verbs, leaving the \"object\" distinct; other languages may have different strategies, or, rarely, make no distinction at all. Distinctions may be made morphologically (through grammatical case or verbal agreement), syntactically (through word order), or both.\n\nFor example, in English, in \"the dog chased the cat\" (transitive verb, two arguments), and in \"the bird flew\" (intransitive verb, one argument), 'dog' and 'bird' are both subjects, which is shown by their appearance before the verb, while 'cat' is different, an object, coming after the verb. Not all languages treat 'dog' and 'bird' as equivalent the way English does: in some 'cat' and 'bird' will be equivalent, while 'dog' is different, and there are yet other systems.\n\nTransitive verbs have two core arguments, labelled A (the more active or in-control) and O, which in a language like English are subject (A) and object (O). Intransitive verbs have a single core argument, labelled S, which in English (but not in all languages) is also a subject. \n\nGenerally, not all three of these labelled arguments (S, A, O) are distinct. In most languages, two are treated one way (such as the subject in English, which covers S and A) and the third is distinct (as the object in English, which covers O). That is, the labels are abstractions. They help illustrate the similarities and differences between languages, but are not real in all but a handful. There is no reality to S vs A in English, for example, only between S/A and O; in other languages, A will be realized, but not S vs O. \n\nThe best-known system is the English type, with a distinct O (object). These are called \"nominative–accusative\" languages, or just \"accusative\" languages, after the nominative and accusative cases, which are how A/S and O are distinguished in Latin. The best known of the other systems is the \"ergative\" system, named after the ergative case, which is how A is marked in many languages (such as Inuit and Basque) which distinguish A from S/O. Yet other systems are found in many Native American languages and in the Philippines. Many Australian languages will sometimes be one, and sometimes another, depending on the situation.\n\nThe principal types, or \"alignments\", so called because S is said to \"align\" with either A (as in English) or O (as in Inuit languages) are summarized here. The distinction between the two most common systems is expanded upon in the next section. For further information, including the rarer systems, see the individual articles.\n\n\nThe direct, tripartite, and transitive alignment types are all quite rare. The alignment types other than Austronesian and Fluid can be shown graphically like this:\n\nIn addition, in some languages, both nominative–accusative and ergative–absolutive systems may be used, split between different grammatical contexts, called split ergativity. The split may sometimes be linked to animacy, as in many Australian Aboriginal languages, or to aspect, as in Mayan languages. A few Australian languages, such as Diyari, are split among accusative, ergative, and tripartite alignment, depending on animacy.\n\nA popular idea, introduced in Anderson (1976), is that some constructions universally favor accusative alignment while others are more flexible. In general, behavioral constructions (control, raising, relativization) are claimed to favor nominative–accusative alignment while coding constructions (especially case constructions) do not show any alignment preferences. This idea underlies early notions of ‘deep’ vs. ‘surface’ (or ‘syntactic’ vs. ‘morphological’) ergativity (e.g. Comrie 1978; Dixon 1994): many languages have surface ergativity only (ergative alignments only in their coding constructions, like case or agreement) but not in their behavioral constructions or at least not in all of them. Languages with deep ergativity (with ergative alignment in behavioral constructions) appear to be less common.\n\nErgative languages contrast with \"nominative–accusative\" languages (such as English), which treat the objects of transitive verbs distinctly from other core arguments.\n\nThese different arguments can be symbolized as follows:\n\n\nThe S/A/O terminology avoids the use of terms like \"subject\" and \"object\", which are not stable concepts from language to language. Moreover, it avoids the terms \"agent\" and \"patient\", which are semantic roles that do not correspond consistently to particular arguments. For instance, the A might be an experiencer or a source, semantically, not just an agent.\n\nThe relationship between ergative and accusative systems can be schematically represented as the following:\n\nThe following Basque examples demonstrate ergative–absolutive case marking system:\n\nIn Basque, \"gizona\" is \"the man\" and \"mutila\" is \"the boy\". In a sentence like \n\"mutila gizonak ikusi du\", you know who's seeing whom because -k is always added to the one doing the seeing. So this means 'the man saw the boy'. To say 'the boy saw the man', just add the \"-k\" to the boy: \"mutilak gizona ikusi du\".\n\nWith a verb like \"etorri\" \"come\" there's no need to tell \"who's coming whom\", so no -k is ever added. \"The boy came\" is 'mutila etorri da'. \n\nTo contrast with a nominative–accusative language, Japanese marks nouns with a different case marking:\n\nIn this language, in the sentence \"man saw child\", the one doing the seeing (\"man\") may be marked with \"ga\", which works like Basque \"-k\" (and the one who is seen may be marked with \"o\"). However, in the sentences like \"the child arrived\", where there's no need of telling \"who arrived whom\", there may be a \"ga\". This is unlike Basque, where \"-k\" is completely forbidden in such sentences.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "183280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183280", "title": "Neoclassicism", "text": "Neoclassicism\n\nNeoclassicism (from Greek νέος \"nèos\", \"new\" and Latin \"classicus\", \"of the highest rank\") is the name given to Western movements in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that draw inspiration from the \"classical\" art and culture of classical antiquity. Neoclassicism was born largely thanks to the writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann, at the time of the rediscovery of Pompeii and Herculaneum, but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their Grand Tour and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals. The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment, and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with Romanticism. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.\n\nEuropean Neoclassicism in the visual arts began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant Rococo style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of Rome and Ancient Greece, and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century Renaissance Classicism. Each \"neo\"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765–1830 paid homage to an \"idea\" of the generation of Phidias, but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of Late Antiquity. The \"Rococo\" art of ancient Palmyra came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's \"The Ruins of Palmyra\". Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the Ottoman Empire, dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, \"corrected\" and \"restored\" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.\n\nNeoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period, which coincided and reflected the developments in philosophy and other areas of the Age of Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding Rococo style. While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of Romanticism, this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered. The case of the supposed main champion of late Neoclassicism, Ingres, demonstrates this especially well. The revival can be traced to the establishment of formal archaeology.\n\nThe writings of Johann Joachim Winckelmann were important in shaping this movement in both architecture and the visual arts. His books \"Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture\" (1750) and \"Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums\" (\"History of Ancient Art\", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\", and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find \"not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of Plato teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone\". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: \"The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients\".\n\nWith the advent of the Grand Tour, a fad of collecting antiquities began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe. \"Neoclassicism\" in each art implies a particular canon of a \"classical\" model.\n\nIn English, the term \"Neoclassicism\" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in English literature, which began considerably earlier, is called Augustan literature. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of classical music, and \"Neoclassicism\" is used of 20th-century developments. However, the operas of Christoph Willibald Gluck represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of \"Alceste\" (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing ornamentation, increasing the role of the chorus in line with Greek tragedy, and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.\n\nThe term \"Neoclassical\" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as \"the true style\", \"reformed\" and \"revival\"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the Renaissance, and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble Baroque of the age of Louis XIV, for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline. Ingres's coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique consular diptychs and their Carolingian revival, to the disapproval of critics.\n\nNeoclassicism was strongest in architecture, sculpture and the decorative arts, where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at Pompeii and Herculaneum and, like most contemporaries except for Gavin Hamilton, was unimpressed by them, citing Pliny the Younger's comments on the decline of painting in his period.\n\nAs for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of Raphael's generation, frescos in Nero's \"Domus Aurea\", Pompeii and Herculaneum, and through renewed admiration of Nicholas Poussin. Much \"Neoclassical\" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally the winning side.\n\nIt is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as \"insipid\" and \"almost entirely uninteresting to us\"—some of Kenneth Clark's comments on Anton Raphael Mengs' ambitious \"Parnassus\" at the Villa Albani, by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as \"the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times\". The drawings, subsequently turned into prints, of John Flaxman used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium) and figures mostly in profile to depict \"The Odyssey\" and other subjects, and once \"fired the artistic youth of Europe\" but are now \"neglected\", while the history paintings of Angelica Kauffman, mainly a portraitist, are described as having \"an unctuous softness and tediousness\" by Fritz Novotny. Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the Greek vases used by Flaxman, Raphael tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. \nThe work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements. The German-Danish painter Asmus Jacob Carstens finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of \"noble simplicity and calm grandeur\". Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the etchings of Giovanni Battista Piranesi were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the Grand Tour to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his \"Vedute\" (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of \"Carceri d'Invenzione\" (\"Imaginary Prisons\") whose \"oppressive cyclopean architecture\" conveys \"dreams of fear and frustration\". The Swiss-born Johann Heinrich Füssli spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the \"Gothic\" strain of Romanticism, and sought to evoke drama and excitement.\n\nNeoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of Jacques-Louis David's \"Oath of the Horatii\" at the Paris Salon of 1785. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a frieze, with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of opera, and the classical colouring of Nicholas Poussin. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the French Revolution became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the Napoleonic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the Bourbon Restoration.\n\nDavid's many students included Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into Orientalism and the Troubadour style that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of Impressionism, but his style, once formed, changed little.\n\nIf Neoclassical painting suffered from a lack of ancient models, Neoclassical sculpture tended to suffer from an excess of them, although examples of actual Greek sculpture of the \"classical period\" beginning in about 500 BC were then very few; the most highly regarded works were mostly Roman copies. The leading Neoclassical sculptors enjoyed huge reputations in their own day, but are now less regarded, with the exception of Jean-Antoine Houdon, whose work was mainly portraits, very often as busts, which do not sacrifice a strong impression of the sitter's personality to idealism. His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a statue of George Washington, as well as busts of Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin and other luminaries of the new republic.\n\nAntonio Canova and the Dane Bertel Thorvaldsen were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the \"Three Graces\". All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.\n\nAn early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede Johan Tobias Sergel. John Flaxman was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for Josiah Wedgwood for several years. Johann Gottfried Schadow and his son Rudolph, one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists, with Franz Anton von Zauner in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor Franz Xaver Messerschmidt turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive \"character heads\" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions. Like Piranesi's \"Carceri\", these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of psychoanalysis in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor Mathieu Kessels studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.\n\nSince prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads, the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of Horatio Greenough, Hiram Powers, Randolph Rogers and William Henry Rinehart.\n\nNeoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for Catherine II's lover, Count Orlov, designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian \"stuccadori\": only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the bas-relief overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.\n\nA second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of engravings) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the Napoleonic Empire. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the \"Louis XVI style\", and the second in the styles called \"Directoire\" or Empire. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.\n\nIn the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in Biedermeier furniture made in Austria; in Karl Friedrich Schinkel's museums in Berlin, Sir John Soane's Bank of England in London and the newly built \"capitol\" in Washington, D.C.; and in Wedgwood's bas reliefs and \"black basaltes\" vases. The style was international; Scots architect Charles Cameron created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born Catherine II the Great, in Russian St. Petersburg.\n\nIndoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s, with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of \"Le Antichità di Ercolano\" (\"The Antiquities of Herculaneum\"). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the Baroque, or the most \"Roman\" rooms of William Kent were based on basilica and temple exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appeatrance to modern eyes: pedimented window frames turned into gilded mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low frieze-like relief or painted in monotones \"en camaïeu\" (\"like cameos\"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or \"bucrania\" or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of \"Pompeiian red\" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the \"Goût grec\" (\"Greek style\"), not a court style; when Louis XVI acceded to the throne in 1774, Marie Antoinette, his fashion-loving Queen, brought the \"Louis XVI\" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: \"Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another\".\n\nFrom about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the Greek Revival. At the same time the Empire style was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of Napoleon in the First French Empire, where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States, the Regency style in Britain, and the \"Napoleon style\" in Sweden. According to the art historian Hugh Honour \"so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces\". An earlier phase of the style was called the Adam style in Great Britain and \"Louis Seize\", or Louis XVI, in France.\n\nNeoclassicism continued to be a major force in academic art through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to Romanticism or Gothic revivals —, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles. The centres of several European cities, notably St. Petersburg and Munich, came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.\n\nGothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, \"romantic\" appearance.\n\nIn England, Augustan literature had a direct parallel with the Augustan style of landscape design. The links are clearly seen in the work of Alexander Pope. The best surviving examples of Neoclassical English gardens are Chiswick House, Stowe House and Stourhead.\n\nIn fashion, Neoclassicism influenced the much greater simplicity of women's dresses, and the long-lasting fashion for white, from well before the French Revolution, but it was not until after it that thorough-going attempts to imitate ancient styles became fashionable in France, at least for women. Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model Emma, Lady Hamilton from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and masquerade balls until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by Juliette Récamier, Joséphine de Beauharnais, Thérésa Tallien and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, Talleyrand quipped that: \"Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!\" (\"One could not be more sumptuously undressed\"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics. Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, bonnets or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.\n\nVery light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the Empire silhouette although it predates the First French Empire of Napoleon, but his first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured. By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.\n\nNeoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or pantaloon, over the \"cullottes\" or knee-breeches of the Ancien Régime. Even when David designed a new French \"national costume\" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the French Revolutionary Wars, and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.\n\nThe trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary history paintings; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In \"James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of Palmyra\" (1758) by Gavin Hamilton, the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in toga-like Arab robes. In \"Watson and the Shark\" (1778) by John Singleton Copley, the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single breeched leg prominently. However the Americans Copley and Benjamin West led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's \"The Death of General Wolfe\" (1770) and Copley's \"The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781\" (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in \"The Raft of the Medusa\", completed in 1819.\n\nClassically inspired male hair styles included the Bedford Crop, arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford as a protest against a tax on hair powder; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French \"à la Titus\" after Titus Junius Brutus (not in fact the Roman Emperor Titus as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both Napoleon and George IV of England. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor François-Joseph Talma, who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as Voltaire's \"Brutus\" (about Lucius Junius Brutus, who orders the execution of his son Titus). In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs, and the style was also worn by women, the \"Journal de Paris\" reporting in 1802 that \"more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig \"à la Titus\".\n\nIn American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the American Renaissance movement, \"ca.\" 1890–1917; its last manifestation was in Beaux-Arts architecture, and its very last, large public projects were the Lincoln Memorial (highly criticized at the time), the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the American Museum of Natural History's Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir Edwin Lutyens' monumental city planning for New Delhi marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.\n\nConservative modernist architects such as Auguste Perret in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a colonnade would have been decried as \"reactionary\", a building's pilaster-like fluted panels under a repeating frieze looked \"progressive\". Pablo Picasso experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following World War I, and the Art Deco style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris \"Exposition des Arts Décoratifs\", often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky commodes by É.-J. Ruhlmann or Süe & Mare; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of Isadora Duncan; the Streamline Moderne styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the Roosevelt dime.\n\nThere was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see 20th-century classical music and Neoclassicism in music. For information on the philosophical aspects, see Great Books.)\n\nThis literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) Dada, in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in English literature were laid by T. E. Hulme, the most famous Neoclassicists were T. S. Eliot and Wyndham Lewis. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of Acmeism, with Anna Akhmatova and Osip Mandelshtam as the leading representatives.\n\nNeoclassicism in music is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the Classical and Baroque musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of Impressionism in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed \"classical\" dancing and costume in ballet and physical education. \n\nThe 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before World War I but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. Respighi's \"Ancient Airs and Dances\" (1917) led the way for the sort of sound the Neoclassicists aspired to. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. Igor Stravinsky is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like Octet for Wind Instruments (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is Prokofiev's Classical Symphony No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of Haydn or Mozart. Neoclassical ballet as innovated by George Balanchine de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.\n\nIn 1905–1914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of Neoclassical revival; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of alexandrine period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-Renaissance, palladian and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like Ivan Fomin, Vladimir Shchuko and Ivan Zholtovsky. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily modernist environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, Ilya Golosov) developed their own modernized styles.\n\nWith the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the Palace of Soviets, Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in Stalinist architecture, although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of Boris Iofan, bordering with contemporary Art Deco (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for constructivist leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.\n\nNeoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies (steel frame or reinforced concrete) and could be reproduced in traditional masonry. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material rationing. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including \"exported\" architecture of Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw and the Shanghai International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when Nikita Khrushchev put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.\n\nAfter a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.\n\nAs of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of New Classical Architecture. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism. Also, a number of pieces of postmodern architecture draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, Antigone District and the National Theatre of Catalonia in Barcelona among them. Postmodern architecture occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.\n\nFor sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term Traditional Architecture (or vernacular) is mostly used. The Driehaus Architecture Prize is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist Pritzker Prize.\n\nIn the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 Schermerhorn Symphony Center in Nashville being an example.\n\nIn Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: Quinlan Terry's Maitland Robinson Library at Downing College and Robert Adam Architects' Sackler Library.\n\n\nSee also the References at Neoclassical architecture.\n\n"}

Until the 1970s, lexicographers worked in relative isolation, and Hartmann is credited with making a major contribution to lexicography and fostering interdisciplinary consultation between reference specialists.\n\nR.R.K. Hartmann is co-author of the standard texts \"Dictionary of Language and Linguistics\" (1972) and the \"Dictionary of Lexicography\" (1998); the former has been translated into Chinese, the latter into Japanese. Hartmann has also produced works on a wide range of linguistic and lexicographic topics (see list of Publications below). Two selections of his essays have been published in Kuwait (2004) and Germany (2007).\n\nReinhard Hartmann was born on 8 April 1938 in Vienna, Austria, as the son of Walther and Gerta Hartmann. He obtained a degree at the Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration, where he later wrote a doctoral dissertation on public economy control and auditing, studied at the University of Vienna, where he was awarded a diploma in English translation, and was a postgraduate student at Southern Illinois University, where he received an M.A. in international economics.\n\nIn 1964, Hartmann moved to Manchester where he married Lynn Warren and where their children Nasim and Stefan were born. He started his career with an appointment as lecturer in modern languages at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. This was followed in 1968 by a lectureship in applied linguistics at the University of Nottingham. From 1974 onwards, Hartmann held senior posts in the Language Centre and the School of English at the University of Exeter, where he also organised a number of influential conferences, such as \"LEXeter ’83\" which led to the creation of the \"European Association of Lexicography\" (EURALEX), the \"International Journal of Lexicography\" and the book series \"Lexicographica Series Maior\" (of which he was one of the co-editors from 1984 to 2008, during which period 134 volumes were published). He attended 12 of the 13 biennial congresses that have been held since 1983, contributing papers at half of them and acting as first secretary and fourth president.\n\nHartmann has also been involved in the founding of AFRILEX (Johannesburg 1995) and ASIALEX (Hong Kong 1997). Other conferences he hosted at Exeter include one on the history of lexicography (Hartmann 1986), which demonstrated that lexicographic traditions differ considerably by dictionary types and languages, and one on lexicography in Africa (Hartmann 1990). He has acted as a consultant to a number of bodies, received a number of grants and fellowships to spend time abroad and to participate in various initiatives to promote the discipline. He also welcomed several visiting scholars for periods at Exeter University. His achievements have been recorded in several international directories, and he is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and of the Chartered Institute of Linguists.\n\nWhile at Exeter, Hartmann supervised over 45 M.A. and 30 Ph.D. dissertations, specialising on such aspects as dictionary criticism (evaluating their many different features), dictionary history (tracing their varying traditions), dictionary typology (classifying their different genres), dictionary use (observing the reference skills needed to access information), contrastive linguistics, translation and bilingual lexicography.\n\nUpon his retirement in 2001, the Dictionary Research Centre that Hartmann had established at the University of Exeter was transferred to the University of Birmingham where he was awarded the title of Honorary Professor of Lexicography in the School of English. Since 2007, Hartmann has been consolidating his various lists of conferences, institutions, dictionary projects, dissertations, and periodicals into an International Directory of Lexicography Institutions.\n\n\n\n"}

It falls between a one-off contract and permanent employment, which may be full-time or part-time. Its distinguishing feature is that the client or customer pays in advance for professional work to be specified later. The purpose of a retainer fee is to ensure payment for future services or work to be rendered.\n\nA retainer agreement may incorporate other contractual provisions regarding the performance of services, or the parties may potentially enter into additional contracts that define the other terms of their working relationship. A retainer fee may be paid on a fixed, pre-negotiated rate or on a variable hourly rate depending on the nature of retainer and also, the practice of the professional being retained.\n\nIt is common for a person seeking the services of a lawyer (attorney) to pay a retainer (\"retainer fee\") to the lawyer, to see a case through to its conclusion. A retainer can be a single advance payment or a recurring (e.g. monthly) payment. Absent an agreement to the contrary, a retainer fee is refundable if the work is not performed.\n\nThe retainer agreement may serve as the basis of authority for a legal advocate. It may limit a lawyer's authority to specific tasks or services, as opposed to providing authority for general purposes. For example, if a lawyer is hired for purposes of litigation, during litigation the advocate will normally be authorized by the client to accept service of documents for which personal service upon the client is not required. In addition to being formally described in a retainer agreement, a client's grant of authority to an attorney may be implied, apparent or usual through the normal practice of the legal professional in providing representation to a client.\n\n"}

He taught for most of his career at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n\nThe Japanese government conferred on him the Order of the Rising Sun, and the Order of the Sacred Treasure, the highest decoration granted to a foreigner by Japan. He was one of seven foreign geographers, and the only American, honored by the Silver Medal of the Tokyo Geographical Society. He served in Japan as the representative of the Asia Foundation 1955- 1960, and founding director of University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies, 1947-1957. He received the \"Meritorious Contribution\" award from the Association of American Geographers in 1956.\n\nHall joined the United States Army in 1913 and rose to the rank of Captain as an intelligence officer in France during World War I. After the war, he became a student at the University of Michigan in 1920, where he obtained his Bachelor's, Master's and in 1927 Doctor's degree in the Department of Geography. His doctoral thesis was based on field work in Haiti. He became Instructor in 1923, the year the Department attained independent status, and was promoted to Professor in 1938.\n\nIn 1928 Hall did his first field work in Japan. When the Second World War began, Hall was studying the Japanese immigrants who had gone to Latin America. He was commissioned a Lieutenant-Colonel in the United States Army, directing operations of the Office of Strategic Services, first on the Pacific Coast, later in the China-India theater, where he was promoted to the rank of Colonel \n\nFollowing the war he returned to University of Michigan. He was president of the Association for Asian Studies in 1951 and served for many years on the board of the Social Science Research Council, including several years as chairman. The fifteen students he directed in their doctoral work chose Japan as the subject of their theses.\n\nHall worked to develop the interdisciplinary study of Asia through the Area Studies approach, both at University of Michigan and through the Association for Asian Studies and the Social Science Research Council. When he was appointed Director of the Center for Japanese Studies in 1947, he made clear that his policy was that the Center would train students in an additional strength, not one which would be an alternative to training in a discipline and that Area Studies would not drain students away from the established departments. The Center's executive committee included members from the departments of Anthropology, Fine Arts, Economics, and the Oriental Studies Program.\n\nHall's study, \"Area Studies: With Special Reference to Their Implications for Research in the Social Sciences\", published in 1947 for the SSRC, drew up the arguments in favor of the approach in order to organize government and foundation support.\n\nThe Center established a research program in Okayama, Japan, in 1950. The program was partly made possible when Hall met directly with Douglas MacArthur, head of the American Occupation of Japan. He later received a telegram from the General saying that the project \"appears to be boldly planned and soundly conceived\" and should \"result in a body of knowledge which will prove of inestimable value...\" Hall stayed in Japan as representative of the Asia Foundation until 1960.\n\n\n\n"}

He also served as a Member of Parliament in the 1970s.\n\nMacFarquhar is the son of Sir Alexander MacFarquhar, a member of the Indian Civil Service and later a senior diplomat at the United Nations where he eventually became Under Secretary for Personnel.\n\nHe was born in Lahore, British India and educated at Fettes College, an independent school in Edinburgh.\n\nAfter spending part of his national service from 1949 to 1950 in Egypt and Jordan as a second lieutenant in the Royal Tank Regiment, he went up to Keble College, Oxford to read Philosophy, Politics and Economics, obtaining a BA in 1953. He then went on to obtain a master's degree from Harvard University in Far Eastern Regional Studies in 1955, studying with John King Fairbank, who supported his career as a China scholar.\n\nHe worked as a journalist on the staff of the \"Daily Telegraph\" and \"Sunday Telegraph\" from 1955 to 1961 specialising in China, and also reported for BBC television \"Panorama\" from 1963 to 1965. He was editor of \"The China Quarterly\" from 1959 to 1968, and a non-resident fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford from 1965 to 1968. In 1969 he was a senior research fellow at Columbia University in New York City, and in 1971 he returned to England to hold a similar fellowship at the Royal Institute of International Affairs. He was also the founding co-presenter of BBC World Service \"24 Hours\" in 1971.\n\nIn the 1966 general election, MacFarquhar fought the Ealing South constituency for the Labour Party but failed to dislodge the sitting Conservative MP. Two years later, he was Labour candidate who attempted to retain the Meriden seat in a by-election; he was on the wrong end of an 18.4% swing at the height of the Wilson government's unpopularity.\n\nFollowing the defeat of George Brown in 1970 and favourable boundary changes, MacFarquhar was selected to fight the Belper constituency, and at the February 1974 general election succeeded in winning the seat from its sitting Conservative MP Geoffrey Stewart-Smith. Although he won, there was an estimated swing of 4% to the Conservatives had the same boundaries applied in the previous election.\n\nMacFarquhar proved a moderate figure, in line with Brown's views. He abstained on a vote to remove the disqualification of left-wing Labour councillors in Clay Cross who had broken council housing laws enacted by the previous Conservative government. However, there were exceptions: he also abstained on a vote to increase the Civil list payments on 26 February 1975. He acted as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to David Ennals, a minister of the state at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and retained the job when Ennals was promoted to be Secretary of State for Social Services. He was made a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology.\n\nIn 1978 MacFarquhar resigned his office as PPS after voting against the Government. In that year, he became a Governor of the School of Oriental and African Studies, a University of London constituent body. The post gave him a job which he could do if he lost his seat. In the 1979 general election, MacFarquhar did indeed lose by 800 votes, and returned to academia and broadcasting (returning to \"24 Hours\" for a year).\n\nHe remained involved in politics and his moderate beliefs made him increasingly uncomfortable in the Labour Party: on 22 October 1981 he announced that he had joined the Social Democratic Party. He fought the South Derbyshire seat, which contained most of then-abolished Belper, for the SDP in the 1983 general election, and nearly succeeded in beating the Labour candidate, although the seat was easily won by the Conservatives.\n\nHe was a fellow of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington D.C. in 1980-81 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1986. In 1980-1983, he was a Leverhulme Research Fellow from 1980 until 1983.\n\nIn 1986-1992, MacFarquhar was Director of the Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University. He was a Walter Channing Cabot Fellow at Harvard in 1993-1994. He is the Leroy B.

{"id": "767577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=767577", "title": "Sanford Meisner", "text": "Sanford Meisner\n\nSanford Meisner (August 31, 1905 – February 2, 1997), also known as Sandy, was an American actor and acting teacher who developed an approach to acting instruction that is now known as the Meisner technique. While Meisner was exposed to method acting at the Group Theatre, his approach differed markedly in that he completely abandoned the use of affective memory, a distinct characteristic of method acting. Meisner maintained an emphasis on \"the reality of doing\", which was the foundation of his approach.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, Meisner was the oldest child of Hermann Meisner, a furrier, and Bertha Knoepfler, both Jewish immigrants who came to the United States from Hungary. His younger siblings were Jacob, Ruth, and Robert. To improve Sanford's health during his youth, his family took a trip to the Catskills. However, while there his brother Jacob contracted bovine tuberculosis from drinking unpasteurized milk and died shortly thereafter. In an interview many years later, Meisner later identified this event as \"the dominant emotional influence in my life from which I have never, after all these years, escaped.\" Blamed by his parents for Jacob's death, the young Meisner became isolated and withdrawn, unable to cope with feelings of guilt for his brother's death.\n\nHe found release in playing the family piano and eventually attended the Damrosch Institute of Music (now the Juilliard School) where he studied to become a concert pianist. When the Great Depression hit, Meisner's father pulled him out of music school to help in the family business in New York City's Garment District. Meisner later recalled that the only way he could endure days spent lugging bolts of fabric was to entertain himself by replaying, in his mind, all the classical piano pieces he had studied in music school. Meisner believed this experience helped him develop an acute sense of sound, akin to perfect pitch. Later, as an acting teacher, he often evaluated his students' scene work with his eyes closed (and his head dramatically buried in his hands). This trick was only partly for effect; the habit, he explained, actually helped him to listen more closely to his students' work and to pinpoint the true and false moments in their acting.\n\nAfter graduation from high school, Meisner pursued acting professionally, which had interested him since his youth. He had acted at the Lower East Side's Chrystie Street Settlement House under the direction of Lee Strasberg, who was to play an important role in his development. At 19, Meisner heard that the Theatre Guild was hiring teenagers. After a brief interview, he was hired as an extra for \"They Knew What They Wanted\". The experience deeply affected him and he realized that acting was what he had been looking for in life. He and Strasberg both appeared in the original Theatre Guild production of the Rodgers and Hart review \"The Garrick Gaieties\", from which the song \"Manhattan\" came.\n\nDespite his parents' misgivings, Meisner continued to pursue a career in acting, receiving a scholarship to study at the Theatre Guild of Acting. Here he encountered once again Harold Clurman and Lee Strasberg. Strasberg was to become another of the century's most influential acting theorists and the father of method acting, an acting technique derived, like Meisner's own, from the system of Konstantin Stanislavski. The three became friends. In 1931, Clurman, Strasberg, and Cheryl Crawford (another Theatre Guild member) selected 28 actors (one of whom was Meisner) to form the Group Theatre. This company exerted an influence on the entire art of acting in the United States. Meisner summered with the Group Theatre at their 1936 rehearsal headquarters at Pine Brook Country Club in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut.\n\nMeisner, along with a number of other actors in the company, eventually resisted Strasberg's preoccupation with affective memory exercises. In 1934, fellow company member Stella Adler returned from private study with Stanislavski in Paris and announced that Stanislavski had come to believe that, as part of a rehearsal process, delving into one's past memories as a source of emotion was only a last resort and that the actor should seek rather to develop the character's thoughts and feelings through physical action, a concentrated use of the imagination, and a belief in the \"given circumstances\" of the text. As a result, Meisner began to focus on a new approach to the art of acting.\n\nWhen the Group Theatre disbanded in 1940, Meisner continued as head of the acting program at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, at which he had taught since 1935. In teaching he found a level of fulfillment similar to that which he had found in playing the piano as a child. At the Playhouse he developed his own form of method acting that was based on Stanislavski's system, Meisner's training with Lee Strasberg, and on Stella Adler's revelations about the uses of the imagination. Today that approach is called the Meisner technique. It was during these early years at The \nNeighborhood Playhouse that Meisner was briefly married to the young actress Peggy Meredith, who appeared in several Broadway productions.\n\nThe Actors Studio was founded in 1947 by two ex-Group Theatre actors Elia Kazan and Robert Lewis, and Cheryl Crawford. Strasberg initially had not been asked to join the group, while Meisner was among the first instructors to teach at the studio. However, by 1951, after Kazan moved to Hollywood to focus on his directorial career, Strasberg became the group's artistic director. In the following years, many students of the Actors Studio became well known in the film industry. Strasberg's later insistence that he had trained them distressed Meisner enormously, creating an animosity with his ex-mentor that continued until Strasberg's death.\n\nIn 1935, Meisner joined the faculty of The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre and continued as the Director of the Acting Department until his retirement in 1990, and served as Director Emeritus until his death in 1997. In 1928, The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre opened its doors. The first class of only nine students had the privilege of being taught by theatre luminaries Martha Graham, Louis Horst, Laura Elliott, and Agnes de Mille. Over his years or teaching at the Playhouse, this founding member of The Group Theatre developed and refined what is now known as the Meisner Technique: \"To live truthfully under given imaginary circumstances.\" The Meisner Technique is a step-by-step procedure of self-investigation for the actor now widely recognized as one of the foremost acting techniques taught today. \n\nNotable students and alumni of The Neighborhood Playhouse under Sanford Meisner's instruction include: Dylan McDermott, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Robert Duvall, Gregory Peck, Diane Keaton, Jeff Goldblum, Tony Randall, Sydney Pollack, David Mamet, Connie Britton, Brian Geraghty, Leslie Moonves, Sherie Rene Scott, Chris Noth, Tucker Smallwood, Mary Steenburgen, Betsy von Furstenberg, Allison Janney, Jennifer Grey, Ashlie Atkinson, Christopher Meloni, Alex Cole Taylor, and many more.\n\nIn 1983, Meisner and his life partner James Carville founded the Meisner/Carville School of Acting on the Caribbean island of Bequia. Students from all around the world came every summer to participate in a summer intensive with Meisner. The Meisner/Carville School of Acting operated on the island and, beginning in 1985, also in North Hollywood. Meisner split his time between the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and the two school locations. In spring of 1995, The Meisner/Carville School of acting was then succeeded by The Sanford Meisner Center for the Arts, a theater company and school in North Hollywood established by Meisner, James Carville, Martin Barter and Jill Gatsby. Graduates from Meisner's 2-year program could audition for the company. The company became a fixture on the Los Angeles theater scene for several years after Meisner's death. Meisner attended every rehearsal and every performance until the very end.\n\nThroughout his career, Meisner worked with, and taught, students who became well known, such as Sandra Bullock, David Duchovny, James Franco, Michelle Pfeiffer, Naomi Watts, Tom Cruise, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Dylan McDermott, Eileen Fulton, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Gregory Peck, Eli Wallach, Jack Lord, Bob Fosse, Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall, Lee Grant, Peter Falk, Jeff Goldblum, Grace Kelly, James Doohan, Tony Randall and Sydney Pollack. Pollack together with Charles E. Conrad served as Meisner's senior assistants. The technique is helpful not just for actors, but also for directors, writers, and teachers. A number of directors also studied with him, among them Sidney Lumet and John Frankenheimer, and writers such as Arthur Miller and David Mamet.\n\nThough he rarely appeared on film, he performed in \"Tender Is the Night\", \"The Story on Page One\", and \"Mikey and Nicky\". His last acting role was in the season one episode of the television medical drama \"ER\", \"Sleepless in Chicago\". Actor Noah Wyle worked with him and referred to the experience as the highlight of his career.\n\nMeisner's two marriages, to Peggy Meredith (née Meyer) and Betty Gooch, respectively, ended in divorce. Meisner, who was gay, spent the remainder of his life with partner James Carville.\n\nIn 1970 Meisner was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent a laryngectomy. After that operation he lived for nearly three more decades, until February 1997, when he died in his sleep at the age of 91 at his home in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles.\n\nMeisner's unusual techniques were considered both unorthodox and effective. Actor Dennis Longwell wrote of sitting in on one of Meisner's classes one day, when Meisner brought two students forward for an acting exercise. They were given a single line of dialogue, told to turn away, and instructed not to do or say anything until something happened to make them say the words (one of the fundamental principles of the Meisner technique). The first student's line came when Meisner approached him from behind and gave him a strong pinch on the back, inspiring him to jump away and yelp his line in pain. The other student's line came when Meisner reached around and slipped his hand into her blouse. Her line came out as a giggle as she moved away from his touch.\n\nThe goal of the Meisner technique has often been described as getting actors to \"live truthfully under imaginary circumstances.\"\n\n\n"}

Bisel (1932–1996) was a physical anthropologist and classical archaeologist who played a prominent role in early scientific research at Herculaneum, a Mediterranean coastal town destroyed by the 79 AD eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Her pioneering work in the chemical and physical analysis of skeletons yielded new insights into the nutrition and health of ancient populations. This was considered ground-breaking and helped advance the field of paleodemography.\n\nBorn Sara Louise Clark on May 13, 1932, in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Dr. Bisel grew up in western Pennsylvania. She graduated from Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh with a bachelor's degree in nutrition and biochemistry. She married Harry Bisel, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist, and lived in Rochester, Minnesota from 1963.\n\nAt the University of Minnesota, she earned a master's degree in classical area studies, with a specialization in Greek archaeology, and a Ph.D. in physical anthropology. She was awarded a fellowship by the Smithsonian Institution in 1977 and conducted independent research funded by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Geographic Society from 1981 to 1988. She was a Visiting Scientist at the Mayo Clinic, and a Research Associate and Fellow at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nThe author of numerous articles published in scholarly and professional journals, she taught at the University of Minnesota, the University of Maryland, and the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, Greece. She worked on various sites throughout Greece, Turkey, Israel and Italy.\n\nHer work at Herculaneum established her international reputation as an authority on ancient health and nutrition.\n\nSara Bisel died on 4 February 1996.\n\n\n\n"}

The swathe width depends on the blade length, the nature of the crop and the mower but is usually about 1.5 metres wide. Mowing may be done by a team of mowers, usually starting at the edges of a meadow then proceeding clockwise leaving a series of staggered swathes and finishing in the middle.\n\nThe mower swings the scythe steadily in long, left handed arcs ending in front of the mower and depositing the cut grass neatly to the left. The mower takes a small step forward and repeats the motion, proceeding with a steady rhythm, stopping at frequent intervals to hone the blade. The correct technique has a slicing action on the grass, cutting a narrow strip, leaving a uniform stubble on the ground and forming a regular windrow on the left.\n\nThe scythe has generally been replaced by machinery such as the swather pictured, or combine harvester which still leaves a swathe to its left but is very much wider than the scythe. Early in the introduction of machinery it was still necessary for mowers with scythes to open up a swathe wide enough to take the machine before it could start\n\nBy analogy, Swath width also refers to the width of any repetitively cut or treated strip. For example, the strip of the Earth’s surface from which geographic data are collected by a moving vehicle such as a satellite, aircraft or ship in the course of swath mapping. The longitudinal extent of the swath is defined by the motion of the vehicle with respect to the surface, whereas the swath width is measured perpendicularly to the longitudinal extent of the swath. Note that swath width is also cited in the context of sonar specifications. It is measured and represented in metres or kilometres.\n"}
{"id": "699908", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=699908", "title": "Theme (narrative)", "text": "Theme (narrative)\n\nIn contemporary literary studies, a theme is the central topic a text treats. Themes can be divided into two categories: a work's \"thematic concept\" is what readers \"think the work is about\" and its \"thematic statement\" being \"what the work says about the subject\".\n\nThe most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (e.g. love, death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology; nostalgia; and the dangers of unchecked ambition. A theme may be exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the thematic idea of loneliness in John Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\", wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the thesis—the text's or author's implied worldview.\n\nA story may have several themes. Themes often explore historically common or cross-culturally recognizable ideas, such as ethical questions, and are usually implied rather than stated explicitly. An example of this would be whether one should live a seemingly better life, at the price of giving up parts of one's humanity, which is a theme in Aldous Huxley’s \"Brave New World\". Along with plot, character, setting, and style, theme is considered one of the components of fiction.\n\nVarious techniques may be used to express many more themes.\n\n\"Leitwortstil\" is the repetition of a wording, often with a theme, in a narrative to make sure it catches the reader's attention. An example of a leitwortstil is the recurring phrase, \"So it goes\", in Kurt Vonnegut's novel \"Slaughterhouse-Five\". Its seeming message is that the world is deterministic: that things only could have happened in one way, and that the future already is predetermined. But given the anti-war tone of the story, the message perhaps is on the contrary, that \"things could have been different\". A non-fictional example of leitwortstil is in the book \"Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now\" written by Gordon Livingston, which is an anthology of personal anecdotes multiple times interjected by the phrases \"Don't do the same thing and expect different results\", \"It is a bad idea to lie to yourself\", and \"No one likes to be told what to do\".\n\n\"Thematic patterning\" means the insertion of a recurring motif in a narrative. For example, various scenes in John Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\" are about loneliness. Thematic patterning is evident in \"One Thousand and One Nights\", an example being the story of \"The City of Brass\". According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass artifacts, is that \"riches and pomp tempt one away from God\". The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur's corpse. According to Pinault, \"each of these minor narratives introduces a character who confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn, the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately reinforce the theme of the major narrative\".\n\nSome common themes in literature are \"love,\" \"war,\" \"revenge,\" \"betrayal,\" \"patriotism,\" \"grace,\" \"isolation,\" \"motherhood,\" \"forgiveness,\" \"wartime loss,\" \"treachery,\" \"rich versus poor,\" \"appearance versus reality,\" and \"help from other-worldly powers.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10284249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10284249", "title": "Wild law", "text": "Wild law\n\nThe term ‘wild law’ was first coined by Cormac Cullinan, to refer to human laws that are consistent with Earth jurisprudence. A wild law is a law made by people to regulate human behaviour that privileges maintaining the integrity and functioning of the whole Earth community in the long term, over the interests of any species (including humans) at a particular time.\n\nWild laws are designed to regulate human participation within this wider community. They seek to balance the rights and responsibilities of humans against those of other members of the community of beings within the natural environment that constitutes Earth (e.g. plants, animals, rivers, and ecosystems) in order to safe-guard the rights of all the members of the Earth community.\n\nWild laws may be distinguished from laws based on the understanding that Earth is a conglomeration of objects which human beings are entitled to exploit for their exclusive benefit (e.g. most property laws). The development of wild laws is motivated partially by the belief that it is desirable, and essential to the survival of many species (probably including humans), for us to change our relationship with the natural world from one of exploitation to a more ‘democratic’ participation in a community of other beings. This requires laws that firstly, recognise that other members of the Earth community have rights, and secondly, restrain humans from unjustifiably infringing those rights (as is done within the human community).\n\nAs a field, wild law cannot easily be categorised within traditional legal categories (e.g. substantive, procedural, private or public law). It is perhaps better understood as an approach to human governance, rather than as a branch of law or a collection of laws.\n\nA conference based on the concept of wild law was held in November 2005 at the University of Brighton, UK. The conference was chaired by former Environment Minister Michael Meacher MP and speakers included Jacqueline McGlade, head of the European Environment Agency and Lynda Warren of the Environment Agency.\n\nIn November 2006, a conference based on the book \"Wild Law\" by Cormac Cullinan was held at the University of Brighton, UK, and organised jointly by UKELA and ELF. 'A Walk on the Wild Side: Changing Environmental Law' and was chaired by John Elkington (of SustainAbility and the ELF Advisory Council) with guest speakers, Cormac Cullinan, Norman Baker MP (former Liberal Democrat Environment Spokesman), Satish Kumar (Resurgence) and Begonia Filgueira (Gaia Law Ltd).\n\n\"A ‘Wild Law’ Response to Climate Change\" workshop was held in September 2007 to develop a practical approach for applying Wild Law principles which are already helping shift legal processes in the US and South Africa. Organised by UKELA, with support from ELF and the Gaia Foundation, London and sponsored by The Body Shop. Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire in the UK, with internationally renowned speakers Cormac Cullinan, author of \"Wild Law\", Professor Brian Goodwin, visiting scholar and teacher on MSc in Holistic Science, at the Schumacher College, International Centre for Ecological Studies, Devon, Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of The Center for Food Safety in USA and founder of the International Center for Technology Assessment, Peter Roderick, director of the Climate Justice Programme and was Friends of the Earth's lawyer in London from 1996.\n\nThe \"’Wild Law’ - Ideas into Action\" residential workshop is to be held in September 2008, to launch the first phase of international research by the UKELA and the Gaia Foundation to identify Wild Law in practice and provide a Wild Law toolkit for decision makers and practitioners. Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire, UK, workshop leaders include: Mellese Damtie, Ethiopian lawyer and biologist, former Dean of the Legal Department at Ethiopia's Civil Service College, Andrew Kimbrell, public interest attorney, activist and author, executive director of the Centre for Food Safety in USA and founder of the International Centre for Technology Assessment; and Professor Lynda Warren, emeritus professor at Aberystwyth University, environmental consultant and the research supervisor.
