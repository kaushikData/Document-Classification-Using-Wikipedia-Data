{"id": "13539370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13539370", "title": "Appomattox (opera)", "text": "Appomattox (opera)\n\nAppomattox is an opera in English based on the American Civil War, composed by Philip Glass, with a libretto by the playwright Christopher Hampton. The work had its world premiere at the San Francisco Opera on October 5, 2007, with a cast that included Dwayne Croft as Robert E. Lee and Andrew Shore as Ulysses S. Grant. The piece is about two and a half hours long, in two acts, with a prologue and an epilogue.\n\nJulia Dent Grant sings of her fears for her husband, Ulysses, and her sense of foreboding. She is soon joined by Mary Custis Lee and her daughter Agnes Lee who worry for their way of life and hope the war will be over soon. Mary Todd Lincoln appears and asks her black servant Elizabeth Keckley to interpret a nightmare her husband, the President, has had. All sing of the sorrows of war and the hope that this will be the last, joined by a female chorus who carry pictures of their loved ones killed in the war.\n\n\"Scene 1: The days leading up to Robert E. Lee's surrender\"\n\nWhile Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant are aboard his floating headquarters on the Potomac, the President and Grant outline a plan to end the war and discuss the generous terms of surrender to be offered to Lee. Their wives arrive, Mrs. Lincoln voicing petty grievances, while Mrs. Grant is steadfast and calm. News of a successful retaking of a Confederate-held fort is brought in by Brigadier General John Rawlins and Colonel Ely S. Parker of the day's battle; Grant then orders the final assault on Richmond. The scene ends with an actual Civil War campfire song. \"Tenting on the Old Camp Ground\", sung by both armies as Grant and Robert E. Lee watch the sunset from their different offices.\n\n\"Scene 2: the offices of General Lee\"\n\nMrs. Lee rejects her husband's advice to flee Richmond before the coming battle. Lee reflects on his reason for joining the Confederacy despite having been offered the leadership of the Union forces: his invincible loyalty to his home state of Virginia. General Howell Cobb arrives to give a report and confronts Lee over a bill he supports, one that will recruit slaves to fight for the Confederacy, a bill that Cobb believes undermines the entire revolution: If slaves make good soldiers, where does that leave the theory of slavery? Lee responds that his business is war, not theorizing.\n\n\"Scene 3\"\n\nJulia Grant, on the eve of the Union's attack on Richmond, reflects on the hard years of her husband's earlier life, including his business failures and alcoholism, but she recalls her mother's prophecy that he would rise to be the highest in the land. Now she worries about the horrible strain the long, bloody war has put on him. Grant assures her that the seemingly endless killing will soon be over.\n\n\"Scene 4: the destruction of Richmond\"\n\nA chorus of refugees flees and sings between bomb blasts. Mrs. Lee, remaining in her home, watches as the residents of Richmond flee and burn everything they own so as to not leave anything behind for the Union army. She and Agnes reflect on the horrors of war. A regiment of black Union soldiers enter and sing a marching tune, a variation of the Marching Song of the First Arkansas. The black reporter T. Morris Chester writes a triumphant report to his newspaper while sitting in the speaker's chair of the House of Representatives. President Lincoln arrives and meets a throng of newly freed slaves. When one of them falls to her knees in front of him, he lifts her up telling her to kneel only to God. The slaves sing a hymn in praise of Lincoln. Mrs. Lee meets with Brig. General Rawlins, and expresses her outrage at having a black soldier as sentry in her occupied house. The sentry is to be replaced with a white soldier.\n\n\"Scene 5: the exchange of letters between Lee and Grant after the taking of Richmond\"\n\nGrant proposes that Lee surrender to avoid further bloodshed. Lee's initial response is equivocal, only inquiring as to the terms Grant might propose, and later suggesting they meet to discuss \"peace\" rather than \"surrender.\" But when Lee receives news of his encircled army's failed breakout attempt, he realizes his options are disappearing. His aide, Brig. General Edward Alexander, proposes a radical change of strategy: guerrilla warfare. Lee rejects the stratagem, saying that the soldiers would have to revert to robbing and plundering just to subsist. With no remaining alternative, Lee writes to Grant and asks for a meeting to discuss surrender. The full, crushing weight of his decision weighs upon him as he accepts the reality of defeat.\n\n\"The Appomattox Court House, Virginia\"\n\nFor the April 9, 1865 meeting to negotiate the surrender, the property is being prepared. Lee arrives impeccably dressed, while Grant in his haste appears in a battered, stained uniform. After polite reminiscence about their past acquaintance, Lee finally raises the subject of surrender. Grant proposes the broader terms and proceeds to write them down.\n\nTheir discussion is interrupted by a sudden flash-forward to early morning, five days later. Mrs. Lincoln tells Elizabeth Keckley about another of the president's nightmares in which he witnessed his own funeral after being killed by an assassin. Keckley interprets the dream as the death of the war, not the President. Mrs. Lincoln tells of another dream, in which the president rode alone on a great ship to a vague, distant shore. This time, Keckley has no answer and rushes from the room. Mrs. Lincoln sees a vision of a funeral procession bearing a flag-draped coffin, and sees herself following it. She screams and collapses, and the action returns to the treaty signing.\n\nGrant proposes—to Lee's great relief—that all officers and men be allowed to return to their homes after handing over their arms. Lee requests a moment to look over the terms.\n\nThe action flashes forward again, to 1873 in Colfax, Louisiana. T. Morris Chester enters and, obviously traumatized, reports the infamous Colfax massacre, in which a hundred black militiamen were cut down by the Ku Klux Klan and White League.\n\nGrant accedes to Lee's request that all his men, not just the officers, be allowed to keep their horses, so that they can return home to work their farms. The terms are set down in ink by Colonel Ely Parker, the only Native American present.\n\nThe scene flashes forward again, this time to 1965. Four Civil Rights Marchers enter and, with the chorus, sing \"The Ballad of Jimmie Lee\", a folk song telling of the murder of Jimmie Lee Jackson, and set out on the Selma to Montgomery marches.\n\nThe meeting concludes as Lee signs the letter accepting the terms, and the generals shake hands. After Lee bows and leaves, he approaches his troops and confirms the surrender; they can go home now, and if they are as good citizens as they were as soldiers, then he will be proud of them.\n\nAs the generals depart, soldiers and civilians advance, and the McLean household is systematically ravaged by souvenir hunters. Rapacity and greed—harbingers of the future—violently intrude on the heels of a moment of historic reconciliation.\n\nThe action flashes forward one last time, to the present day. Edgar Ray Killen, a Klan member now in jail for his role in the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner in 1964, appears. Now an old man who uses a wheelchair, he sings in short, barking phrases of his pride in ordering the death of two Jewish civil rights workers and their black driver, and relives the murder in enthusiastic detail. His horrible recollection over, he disappears.\n\nJulia Grant sorrowfully realizes that the War was not the last, as she has hoped, and that mankind will forever fight and kill. She leads the Women's Chorus in a wordless lament to the sorrow of war.\n\n"}

{"id": "387583", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=387583", "title": "Calvary", "text": "Calvary\n\nCalvary, or Golgotha (Biblical Greek \"Golgotha[s]\", traditionally interpreted as reflecting Syriac (Aramaic) \"golgolta\", as it were Hebrew \"gulgōleṯ\" \"skull\"), was, according to the Gospels, a site immediately outside Jerusalem's walls where Jesus was crucified. \n\nMatthew's and Mark's gospels translate the term to mean \"place of [the] skull\" ( \"Kraníou Tópos\"), in Latin rendered \"Calvariæ Locus\", from which the English word \"Calvary\" derives.\n\nIts traditional site, identified by Helena of Constantinople, the mother of Constantine I, in 325, is at the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. A 19th-century suggestion places it at the site now known as \"Skull Hill\", some 500 m to the north (200 m north of Damascus Gate). Historian Joan Taylor bases a location c. 175 metres south-southeast of the traditional site on her reading of textual evidence.\n\nThe recorded form Γολγοθα may be a simplified pronunciation of an Aramaic \"golgolta\", corresponding to Hebrew \"gulgōleṯ\" () \"skull\". \n\nEnglish \"Calvary\" is the anglicized form of the Latin gloss from the Vulgate (\"Calvariæ\"), to refer to Golgotha in Luke 23:33,\nwhere the Greek text gives Κρανίον rather than the explicit Κρανίου Τόπος of Matthew and Mark.\nThe adoption the Latin form has a long tradition in English Bible translations, going back to at least the late 10th century (Wessex Gospels), and is retained in Wycliffe's Bible and Tyndale's Bible as well as in the King James Version. \nBy contrast, Luther is translating Luke's Κρανίον, as German \"\" (\"place of skull(s)\"). The Latinism is also current in various other languages within the Latin sphere of influence, including Spanish and Italian \"Calvario\", French \"Calvaire\", Polish \"Kalwaria\", Lithuanian \"Kalvarijos\".\n\nThe church fathers offer different interpretations for the name; either deriving it from a topographic feature resembling a cranium (Pseudo-Tertullian),\nor alternatively as the site where the skull of Adam was said to be buried (Origenes), or from skulls of those executed there (Jerome, \"locum decollatorum\").\n\nThe association of the site with the \"skull of Adam\" is expanded in a number of early Christian sources, including the \"Kitab al-Magall\", the \"Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan\", the \"Cave of Treasures\", as well as by Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria (9th century). According to these accounts, Shem and Melchizedek traveled to the resting place of Noah's Ark, retrieved the body of Adam from it, and were led by Angels to Golgotha – described as a skull-shaped hill at the centre of the Earth, where also the serpent's head had been crushed following the Fall of Man.\n\nWhile the Gospels merely identify Calvary as a \"place\" (), Christian tradition since at least the 6th century has described the location as \"mountain\" or \"hill\", \n\nThe location itself is mentioned in all four canonical Gospels:\n\nAn alternative suggestion, due to Krafft (1846)\nproposes that the reported association with the word \"skull\" is a popular etymology of an original name \"Gol Goatha\", interpreted (by Krafft) as meaning \"heap of death\", or \"hill of execution\";\nthe supposed toponym \"Goatha\" has also been identified, by Ferguson (1847), \nwith the location called \"Goʿah\" (גֹּעָה) in Jeremiah 31:39, in a description of the geography of Jerusalem.\n\nThere is no consensus as to the location of the site. John () describes the crucifixion site as being \"near the city\". According to Hebrews (), it was \"outside the city wall\". and both note that the location would have been accessible to \"passers-by\". Thus, locating the crucifixion site involves identifying a site that, in the city of Jerusalem some four decades before its destruction in AD 70, would have been outside the city walls and well visible to passers-by.\n\nChristian tradition since the 4th century has favoured a location now within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This places it well within Jerusalem's Old City Walls, which were built in the 16th century. Proponents of the traditional Holy Sepulchre location point out at the fact that 1st-century Jerusalem had a different shape and size from the 16th-century city, leaving the church's site outside the pre-AD 70 city walls. Those opposing it doubt this.\n\nDefenders of the traditional site have argued that the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was only brought within the city limits by Herod Agrippa (41–44), who built a so-called Third Wall around a newly-settled northern district, while at the time of Jesus' crucifixion around AD 30 it would still have been just outside the city.\n\nHenry Chadwick (2003) argued that when Hadrian's builders replanned the old city, they \"incidentally confirm[ed] the bringing of Golgotha inside a new town wall.\"\n\nIn 2007 Dan Bahat, the former City Archaeologist of Jerusalem and Professor of Land of Israel Studies at Bar-Ilan University, stated that \"Six graves from the first century were found on the area of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. That means, this place [was] outside of the city, without any doubt…\", thus maintaining that there are no scientific, archaeological grounds for rejecting the traditional location for Calvary.\n\nSome Protestant advocates of an alternative site claim that a wall would imply the existence of a defensive ditch outside it, so an earlier wall couldn't be immediately adjacent to the \"Golgotha\" site, which, combined with the presence of the Temple Mount, would make the city inside the wall quite thin. Essentially, for the traditional site to have been outside the wall, the city would have had to be limited to the lower parts of the Tyropoeon Valley, rather than including the defensively advantageous western hill. Since these geographic considerations imply that not including the hill within the walls would be willfully making the city prone to attack from it, some scholars, including the late 19th century surveyors of the Palestine Exploration Fund, consider it unlikely that people would build a wall that cut the hill off from the city in the valley. However, archaeological digs within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre proved the existence of six graves from the first century on the area of the church, placing it outside the city area and casting doubt on the \"Strategic Weakness\" and \"Defensive Ditch\" hypotheses.\n\nJoan Taylor supports a location inside the Old City, east of Jaffa Gate, southwest of the David and Habad Street junction, but still north of St Mark's Street. She considers that canonical as well as apocryphal Gospels, in connection with the known history and archaeology of Aelia Capitolina and Byzantine Jerusalem, together with the works of Melito of Sardis and Eusebius, indicate that Golgotha was the name of an area created by a large First Temple Period quarry, and not just of the crucifixion site, the latter of which she locates at the southern margin of this area. At the same time, Taylor supports the traditional location of the tomb.\n\nThe traditional location of Golgotha derives from its identification by Helena, the mother of Constantine I, in 325. \nOnly a few steps away (within ), Helena also identified the location of the tomb of Jesus and claimed to have discovered the True Cross; her son, Constantine, then built the Church of the Holy Sepulchre around the whole site. In 333, the Pilgrim of Bordeaux, entering from the east described the result:\n\nIn Nazénie Garibian de Vartavan's doctoral thesis, now published as \"La Jérusalem Nouvelle et les premiers sanctuaires chrétiens de l’Arménie. Méthode pour l’étude de l’église comme temple de Dieu,\" she concluded, through multiple arguments (mainly theological and archaeological), that the true site of Golgotha was precisely at the vertical of the now buried Constantinian basilica's altar and away from where the traditional rock of Golgotha is situated. The plans published in the book indicate the location of the Golgotha within a precision of less than two meters, below the circular passage situated a metre away from where the blood stained shirt of Christ was traditionally recovered and immediately before the stairs leading down to \"St. Helena's Chapel\" (the above-mentioned mother of Emperor Constantine), alternatively called \"St. Vartan's Chapel\".\n\nPrior to Helena's identification, the site had been a temple to Aphrodite. Constantine's construction took over most of the site of the earlier temple enclosure, and the \"Rotunda\" and cloister (which was replaced after the 12th century by the present \"Catholicon\" and \"Calvary chapel\") roughly overlap with the temple building itself; the basilica church Constantine built over the remainder of the enclosure was destroyed at the turn of the 11th century, and has not been replaced. Christian tradition claims that the location had originally been a Christian place of veneration, but that Hadrian had deliberately buried these Christian sites and built his own temple on top, on account of his alleged hatred for Christianity.\n\nThere is certainly evidence that circa 160 CE, at least as early as 30 years after Hadrian's temple had been built, Christians associated it with the site of \"Golgotha\"; Melito of Sardis, an influential mid-2nd century bishop in the region, described the location as \"in the middle of the street, in the middle of the city\", which matches the position of Hadrian's temple within the mid-2nd century city.\n\nRomans typical built a city according to a Hippodamian grid plan—a North-South arterial road, the Cardo (which is now the Suq Khan-ez-Zeit), and an East-West arterial road, the Decumanus Maximus (which is now the Via Dolorosa). The forum would traditionally be located on the intersection of the two roads, with the main temples adjacent. However, due to the obstruction posed by the Temple Mount, as well as the Tenth Legion encampment on the Western Hill, Hadrian's city had two \"Cardo\", two \"Decamanus Maximus\", two forums, and several temples. The Western Forum (now Muristan) is located on the crossroads of the West Cardo and what is now El-Bazar/David Street, with the Temple of Aphrodite adjacent, on the intersection of the Western Cardo and the Via Dolorossa. The Northern Forum is located north of the Temple Mount, on the junction of the Via Dolorossa and the Eastern Cardo, adjacent to the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus intentionally built atop the Temple Mount. Another popular holy site that Hadrian converted to a pagan temple was the Pool of Bethesda, possibly referenced to in the fifth chapter of the Gospel of John, on which was built the Temple of Asclepius and Serapis. While the positioning of the Temple of Aphrodite may be, in light of the common Colonia layout, entirely unintentional, Hadrian is known to have concurrently built pagan temples on top of other holy sites in Jerusalem as part of an overall Romanization policy.\n\nArchaeological excavations under the Church of the Holy Sepulchre have revealed Christian pilgrims' graffiti, dating from the period that the Temple of Aphrodite was still present, of a ship, a common early Christian symbol and the etching \"DOMINVS IVIMVS\", meaning \"Lord, we went\", lending possible support to the statement by Melito of Sardis asserting that early Christians identified Golgotha as being in the middle of Hadrian's city rather than outside.\n\nDuring 1973–1978 restoration works and excavations inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and under the nearby Muristan, it was found that the area was originally a quarry, from which white Meleke limestone was struck; surviving parts of the quarry to the north-east of the chapel of St. Helena are now accessible from within the chapel (by permission). Inside the church is a rock, about 7 m long by 3 m wide by 4.8 m high, that is traditionally believed to be all that now remains visible of \"Golgotha\"; the design of the church means that the \"Calvary Chapel\" contains the upper foot or so of the rock, while the remainder is in the chapel beneath it (known as the \"tomb of Adam\"). Virgilio Corbo, a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, present at the excavations, suggested that from the city the little hill (which still exists) could have looked like a skull.\n\nDuring a 1986 repair to the floor of the \"Calvary Chapel\" by the art historian George Lavas and architect Theo Mitropoulos, a round slot of diameter was discovered in the rock, partly open on one side (Lavas attributes the open side to accidental damage during his repairs); although the dating of the slot is uncertain, and could date to Hadrian's temple of Aphrodite, Lavas suggested that it could have been the site of the crucifixion, as it would be strong enough to hold in place a wooden trunk of up to in height (among other things). The same restoration work also revealed a crack running across the surface of the rock, which continues down to the \"Chapel of Adam\"; the crack is thought by archaeologists to have been a result of the quarry workmen encountering a flaw in the rock.\n\nBased on the late 20th century excavations of the site, there have been a number of attempted reconstructions of the profile of the cliff face. These often attempt to show the site as it would have appeared to Constantine. However, as the ground level in Roman times was about lower and the site housed Hadrian's temple to Aphrodite, much of the surrounding rocky slope must have been removed long before Constantine built the church on the site. The height of the \"Golgotha\" rock itself would have caused it to jut through the platform level of the Aphrodite temple, where it would be clearly visible. The reason for Hadrian not cutting the rock down is uncertain, but Virgilio Corbo suggested that a statue, probably of Aphrodite, was placed on it, a suggestion also made by Jerome. Some archaeologists have been suggested that prior to Hadrian's use, the rock outcrop had been a \"nefesh\" - a Jewish funeral monument, equivalent to the stele.\n\nThe Itinerarium Burdigalense speaks of Golgotha in 333: \"... On the left hand is the little hill of Golgotha where the Lord was crucified. About a stone's throw from thence is a vault (crypta) wherein His body was laid, and rose again on the third day. There, at present, by the command of the Emperor Constantine, has been built a basilica, that is to say, a church of wondrous beauty,\" Cyril of Jerusalem, a distinguished theologian of the early Church, and eyewitness to the early days of Constantine's edifice, speaks of Golgotha in eight separate passages, sometimes as near to the church where he and his listeners assembled: \"Golgotha, the holy hill standing above us here, bears witness to our sight: the Holy Sepulchre bears witness, and the stone which lies there to this day.\" And just in such a way the pilgrim Egeria often reported in 383: \"… the church, built by Constantine, which is situated in Golgotha …\" and also bishop Eucherius of Lyon wrote to the island presbyter Faustus in 440: \"Golgotha is in the middle between the Anastasis and the Martyrium, the place of the Lord's passion, in which still appears that rock which once endured the very cross on which the Lord was.\", and Breviarius de Hierosolyma reports in 530: \"From there (the middle of the basilica), you enter into Golgotha, where there is a large court. Here the Lord was crucified. All around that hill, there are silver screens.\" (See also: Eusebius in 338).\nIn 1842, heavily relying on the research of Edward Robinson, a German theologian and biblical scholar from Dresden named Otto Thenius was the first to publish a proposal that the rocky knoll north of Damascus Gate was the biblical \"Golgotha\". \nIn 1882–83, Major-General Charles George Gordon endorsed this view, and subsequently the site has sometimes been known as Gordon's Calvary. The location, usually referred to today as \"Skull Hill\", is beneath a cliff that contains two large sunken holes, which Gordon regarded as resembling the eyes of a skull. He and a few others before him believed that the skull-like appearance would have caused the location to be known as Golgotha.\n\nNearby is an ancient rock-cut tomb known today as the Garden Tomb, which Gordon proposed as the tomb of Jesus. The Garden Tomb contains several ancient burial places, although the archaeologist Gabriel Barkay has proposed that the tomb dates to the 7th century BCE and that the site may have been abandoned by the 1st century.\n\nEusebius comments that Golgotha was in his day (the 4th century) pointed out \"north of Mount Zion\". While \"Mount Zion\" was used previously in reference to the Temple Mount itself, Josephus, the first-century CE historian who knew the city as it was before the Roman destruction of Jerusalem, identified Mount Zion as being the Western Hill (the current Mount Zion), which is south of both the Garden Tomb and the Holy Sepulchre. Eusebius' comment therefore offers no additional argument for either location.\n\nSee Joan Taylor's theory in the article's introduction and under Alternative theories.\n\nAnother alternative location has been proposed by Rodger Dusatko, a missionary in Germany. He claims that the location of Golgotha is just outside the Lions Gate.\n\nAll four Gospels use the Greek word 'Kranion' to describe the place where Jesus was crucified. Unlike Skufion (skull), Kranion (in English - cranium) is the upper part of the skull excluding the face bones.\n\nSince the temple faced east, the curtain in front of the entrance of the temple would have been in direct view of those gathered on this mount at the northeast corner of the Temple Mount, just outside the city wall. And to testify that the curtain ripped at the very moment when Jesus died, there must have been eyewitnesses.\n\nThe Gospel of John refers to Golgotha as being very near the city, so near that all who passed by could read the inscription. Considering also the prophecy in Psalms 69:12, his place of crucifixion would have been near enough to the gate that Jesus could hear what the people were saying about him there. And just as Eusebius comments in Onomasticon concerning Golgotha as being a hill just outside Jerusalem, north of the ancient Mount Zion, this hill fits his description.\n\n"}

Besides film there is ample attention for a wide range of aspects of Japanese culture, with musical performances in various locations, art installations, debates, tastings, workshops and much more.\n\nThe extensive film programme consists of numerous short films, feature films and documentaries, most of which are only shown in the Netherlands during the Camera Japan Festival. Besides recent films, the festival also shows older classic and rare movies as part of a special retrospective. In the past few years the festival presented retrospectives on Japanese film noir, the soft-erotic pink movie and of the work of Kôji Wakamatsu en Shinji Somai.\n\nCAMERA JAPAN Festival also organises a wide range of activities around its movie programme and the yearly main theme. Several concerts of Japanese bands and DJs, lectures, debates and workshops are organised. Fixed components are the interventions, unannounced performances ranging from traditional to experimental music and dance performances, the movie brunch and the CAMERA JAPAN Kid's Day, on which the youngest visitors get acquainted with the richness of Japanese culture and cuisine through traditional games and other activities.\n\nEach year at the end of the festival the feature-length film with the highest audience appreciation is announced.\nMain location of the festival in Rotterdam is film and music theater LantarenVenster. The festival also works together with cultural institutions such as WORM (Rotterdam) and Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam.\n\nIn Amsterdam, Camera Japan has screened films and organised musical performances in Filmtheater Kriterion, Melkweg and EYE Film Institute Netherlands.\n\n"}
{"id": "75462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75462", "title": "Cilicia", "text": "Cilicia\n\nIn antiquity, Cilicia () was the south coastal region of Asia Minor and existed as a political entity from Hittite times into the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia during the late Byzantine Empire. Extending inland from the southeastern coast of modern Turkey, Cilicia is due north and northeast of the island of Cyprus and corresponds to the modern region of Çukurova in Turkey.\n\nCilicia extended along the Mediterranean coast east from Pamphylia, to the Nur Mountains, which separated it from Syria. North and east of Cilicia lie the rugged Taurus Mountains that separate it from the high central plateau of Anatolia, which are pierced by a narrow gorge, called in antiquity the Cilician Gates. Ancient Cilicia was naturally divided into Cilicia Trachaea and Cilicia Pedias by the Limonlu River. Salamis, the city on the east coast of Cyprus, was included in its administrative jurisdiction. The Greeks invented for Cilicia an eponymous Hellene founder in the purely mythical Cilix, but the historic founder of the dynasty that ruled \"Cilicia Pedias\" was Mopsus, identifiable in Phoenician sources as \"Mpš\", the founder of Mopsuestia who gave his name to an oracle nearby. Homer mentions the people of Mopsus, identified as Cilices (Κίλικες), as from the Troad in the northernwesternmost part of Anatolia.\n\nThe English spelling \"Cilicia\" is the same as the Latin, as it was transliterated directly from the Greek form Κιλικία. The palatalization of c occurring in the west in later Vulgar Latin (c. 500–700) accounts for its modern pronunciation in English.\n\nCilicia Trachea (\"rugged Cilicia\"—Greek: Κιλικία Τραχεῖα; the Assyrian \"Hilakku\", classical \"Cilicia\") is a rugged mountain district formed by the spurs of Taurus, which often terminate in rocky headlands with small sheltered harbors, a feature which, in classical times, made the coast a string of havens for pirates and, in the Middle Ages, outposts for Genoese and Venetian traders. The district is watered by the Calycadnus and was covered in ancient times by forests that supplied timber to Phoenicia and Egypt. Cilicia lacked large cities.\n\nCilicia Pedias (\"flat Cilicia\"—; Assyrian \"Kue\"), to the east, included the rugged spurs of Taurus and a large coastal plain, with rich loamy soil, known to the Greeks such as Xenophon, who passed through with his mercenary group of the Ten Thousand, for its abundance (\"euthemia\"), filled with sesame and millet and olives and pasturage for the horses imported by Solomon. Many of its high places were fortified. The plain is watered by the three great rivers, the Cydnus (Tarsus Çay), the Sarus (Seyhan) and the Pyramus (Ceyhan River), each of which brings down much silt from the deforested interior and which fed extensive wetlands. The Sarus now enters the sea almost due south of Tarsus, but there are clear indications that at one period it joined the Pyramus, and that the united rivers ran to the sea west of Kara-tash. Through the rich plain of Issus ran the great highway that linked east and west, on which stood the cities of Tarsus (Tarsa) on the Cydnus, Adana (Adanija) on the Sarus, and Mopsuestia (Missis) on the Pyramus.\n\nCilicia was settled from the Neolithic period onwards. Dating of the ancient settlements of the region from Neolithic to Bronze Age is as follows: Aceramic/Neolithic: 8th and 7th millennia BC; Early Chalcolithic: 5800 BC; Middle Chalcolithic (correlated with Halaf and Ubaid developments in the east): c. 5400–4500 BC; Late Chalcolithic: 4500–c. 3400 BC; and Early Bronze Age IA: 3400–3000 BC; EBA IB: 3000–2700 BC; EBA II: 2700–2400 BC; EBA III A-B: 2400–2000 BC.\n\nThe area had been known as Kizzuwatna in the earlier Hittite era (2nd millennium BC). The region was divided into two parts, Uru Adaniya (flat Cilicia), a well-watered plain, and \"rough\" Cilicia (Tarza), in the mountainous west.\n\nThe Cilicians appear as \"Hilikku\" in Assyrian inscriptions, and in the early part of the first millennium BC were one of the four chief powers of Western Asia. Homer mentions the plain as the \"Aleian plain\" in which Bellerophon wandered, but he transferred the Cilicians far to the west and north and made them allies of Troy. The Cilician cities unknown to Homer already bore their pre-Greek names: Tarzu (Tarsus), Ingira (Anchiale), Danuna-Adana, which retains its ancient name, Pahri (perhaps Mopsuestia), Kundu (Kyinda, then Anazarbus) and Azatiwataya (today's Karatepe).\n\nThere exists evidence that circa 1650 BC both Hittite kings Hattusili I and Mursili I enjoyed freedom of movement along the Pyramus River (now the Ceyhan River in southern Turkey), proving they exerted strong control over Cilicia in their battles with Syria. After the death of Murshili around 1595 BC, Hurrians wrested control from the Hitties, and Cilicia was free for two centuries. The first king of free Cilicia, Išputahšu, son of Pariyawatri, was recorded as a \"great king\" in both cuneiform and Hittite hieroglyphs. Another record of Hittite origins, a treaty between Išputahšu and Telipinu, king of the Hittites, is recorded in both Hittite and Akkadian.\n\nIn the next century, Cilician king Pilliya finalized treaties with both King Zidanta II of the Hittites and Idrimi of Alalakh, in which Idrimi mentions that he had assaulted several military targets throughout Eastern Cilicia. Niqmepa, who succeeded Idrimi as king of Alalakh, went so far as to ask for help from a Hurrian rival, Shaushtatar of Mitanni, to try and reduce Cilicia's power in the region. It was soon apparent, however, that increased Hittite power would soon prove Niqmepa's efforts to be futile, as the city of Kizzuwatna soon fell to the Hittites, threatening all of Cilicia. Soon after, King Sunassura II was forced to accept vassalization under the Hittites, becoming the last king of ancient Cilicia.\n\nIn the 13th century BC a major population shift occurred as the Sea Peoples overran Cilicia. The Hurrians that resided there deserted the area and moved northeast towards the Taurus Mountains, where they settled in the area of Cappadocia.\n\nIn the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of Mukšuš, whom the Greeks rendered Mopsos and credited as the founder of Mopsuestia, though the capital was Adana. Mopsuestia's multicultural character is reflected in the bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries, written both in Indo-European hieroglyphic Luwian and West Semitic Phoenician.\n\nIn the ninth century BC it became part of Assyria and remained so until the late seventh century BC.\n\nUnder the Persian empire Cilicia was apparently governed by tributary native kings who bore a Hellenized name or the title of \"Syennesis\", but it was officially included in the fourth satrapy by Darius. Xenophon found a queen in power, and no opposition was offered to the march of Cyrus the Younger.\n\nThe great highway from the west existed before Cyrus conquered Cilicia. On its long rough descent from the Anatolian plateau to Tarsus, it ran through the narrow pass between walls of rock called the Cilician Gates. After crossing the low hills east of the Pyramus it passed through a masonry (Cilician) gate, Demir Kapu, and entered the plain of Issus. From that plain one road ran southward through another masonry (Syrian) gate to Alexandretta, and thence crossed Mt. Amanus by the Syrian Gate, Beilan Pass, eventually to Antioch and Syria. Another road ran northwards through a masonry (Armenian) gate, south of Toprak Kale, and crossed Mt. Amanus by the Armenian Gate, Baghche Pass, to northern Syria and the Euphrates. By the last pass, which was apparently unknown to Alexander, Darius crossed the mountains prior to the battle of Issus. Both passes are short and easy and connect Cilicia Pedias geographically and politically with Syria rather than with Anatolia.\n\nAlexander forded the Halys River in the summer of 333 BC, ending up on the border of southeastern Phrygia and Cilicia. He knew well the writings of Xenophon, and how the Cilician Gates had been \"impassable if obstructed by the enemy\". Alexander reasoned that by force alone he could frighten the defenders and break through, and he gathered his men to do so. In the cover of night they attacked, startling the guards and sending them and their satrap into full flight, setting their crops aflame as they made for Tarsus. This good fortune allowed Alexander and his army to pass unharmed through the Gates and into Cilicia.\n\nAfter Alexander's death it was long a battleground of rival Hellenistic monarchs and kingdoms, and for a time fell under Ptolemaic dominion (i.e., Egypt), but finally came to the Seleucids, who, however, never held effectually more than the eastern half. During the Hellenistic era, numerous cities were established in Cilicia, which minted coins showing the badges (gods, animals and objects) associated with each polis.\n\nCilicia Trachea became the haunt of pirates, who were subdued by Pompey in 67 BC following a Battle of Korakesion (modern Alanya), and Tarsus was made the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia.\nCilicia Pedias became Roman territory in 103 BC first conquered by Marcus Antonius Orator in his campaign against pirates, with Sulla acting as its first governor, foiling an invasion of Mithridates, and the whole was organized by Pompey, 64 BC, into a province which, for a short time, extended to and included part of Phrygia.\n\nIt was reorganized by Julius Caesar, 47 BC, and about 27 BC became part of the province Syria-Cilicia Phoenice. At first the western district was left independent under native kings or priest-dynasts, and a small kingdom, under Tarcondimotus I, was left in the east; but these were finally united to the province by Vespasian, AD 72. Containing 47 known cities, it had been deemed important enough to be governed by a proconsul.\n\nUnder Emperor Diocletian's Tetrarchy (c. 297), Cilicia was governed by a \"consularis\"; with Isauria and the Syrian, Mesopotamian, Egyptian and Libyan provinces, formed the Diocesis Orientis (in the late 4th century the African component was split off as Diocese of Egypt), part of the pretorian prefecture also called \"Oriens\" ('the East', also including the dioceses of Asiana and Pontica, both in Anatolia, and Thraciae in the Balkans), the rich bulk of the eastern Roman Empire.\n\nRoman Cilicia exported the goats-hair cloth, \"Cilicium\", which was used to make tents. Tarsus was also the birthplace of the early Christian missionary and author St. Paul, writer (or purported writer) of 13 of the 27 books included in the New Testament.\n\nCilicia had numerous Christian communities and is mentioned six times in the Book of Acts and once in the Epistle to the Galatians (1:21). After Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century, Cilicia was included in the territories of the patriarchate of Antioch. The region was divided into two civil and ecclesiastical provinces: \"Cilicia Prima\", with a metropolitan diocese at Tarsus and suffragan dioceses for Pompeiopolis, Sebaste, Augusta, Corycus, Adana, Mallus and Zephyrium; and \"Cilicia Secunda\", with a metropolitan diocese at Anazarbus and suffragan dioceses for Mopsuestia, Aegae, Epiphania, Irenopolis, Flavias, Castabala, Alexandria, Citidiopolis and Rhosus. Bishops from the various dioceses of Cilicia were well represented at the First Council of Nicaea in 325 and at the later ecumenical councils.\n\nAfter the breakup of the Roman Empire, Cilicia became part of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nIn the 7th century Cilicia was invaded by the Muslim Arabs. The area was for some time an embattled no-man's land. The Arabs succeeded in conquering the area in the early 8th century. Under the Abbasid Caliphate, Cilicia was resettled and transformed into a fortified frontier zone (\"thughur\"). Tarsus, re-built in 787/788, quickly became the largest settlement in the region and the Arabs' most important base in their raids across the Taurus Mountains into Byzantine-held Anatolia.\n\nThe Muslims held the country until it was reoccupied by the Emperor Nicephorus II in a series of campaigns in 962–965. From this period onward, the area increasingly came to be settled by Armenians, especially as Imperial rule pushed deeper into the Caucasus over the course of the 11th century.\n\nDuring the time of the Crusades, the area was controlled by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. The Seljuk Turkish invasions of Armenia were followed by an exodus of Armenians migrating westward into the Byzantine Empire, and in 1080 Ruben, a relative of the last king of Ani, founded in the heart of the Cilician Taurus a small principality which gradually expanded into the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. This Christian state, surrounded by Muslim states hostile to its existence, had a stormy history of about 300 years, giving valuable support to the Crusaders, and trading with the great commercial cities of Italy.\n\nIt prospered for three centuries due to the vast network of fortifications which secured all the major roads as well as the three principal harbours at Ayas, Koŕikos, and Mopsuestia. Through their complex alliances with the Crusader states the Armenian barons and kings often invited the Crusaders to maintain castles in and along the borders of the Kingdom, including Bagras, Trapessac, T‛il Hamtun, Harunia, Selefkia, Amouda, and Sarvandikar.\n\nGosdantin (r. 1095 – c. 1100) assisted the crusaders on their march to Antioch, and was created knight and marquis. Thoros I (r. c. 1100 – 1129), in alliance with the Christian princes of Syria, waged successful wars against the Byzantines and Seljuk Turks. Levon II (Leo the Great (r. 1187–1219)), extended the kingdom beyond Mount Taurus and established the capital at Sis. He assisted the crusaders, was crowned King by the Archbishop of Mainz, and married one of the Lusignans of the crusader kingdom Cyprus.\n\nHetoum I (r. 1226–1270) made an alliance with the Mongols, sending his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in person. The Mongols then assisted with the defense of Cilicia from the Mamluks of Egypt, until the Mongols themselves converted to Islam. When Levon V died (1342), John of Lusignan was crowned king as Gosdantin IV; but he and his successors alienated the native Armenians by attempting to make them conform to the Roman Church, and by giving all posts of honor to Latins, until at last the kingdom, falling prey to internal dissensions, succumbed in 1375 to the attacks of the Egyptian Mamluks.\n\nAfter the collapse of the Anatolian Seljuks, a number of Turkmen principalities (collectively known as Anatolian beyliks) emerged. Cilicia Thracea was conquered by Karamanids a beylik to the north of Cilicia in the 15th century. Cilica Pedias shared a similar fate. In 1375 Ramazanids, another beylik to the east of the region, defeated The Armenian Kingdom with the support of Mamluks of Egypt. \nTowards the end of the 15th century when the Ottomans defeated the Karamnids, Cilicia Thracea fell to Ottomans. In 1517 Ramazanids also submitted to Ottomans.\n\nIn the 15th century, Cilicia fell under Ottoman dominion and officially became known as the Adana Vilayet. Cilicia was one of the most important regions for the Ottoman Armenians because it managed very well to preserve Armenian character throughout the years. In fact, the Cilician highlands were densely populated by Armenian peasants in small but prosperous towns and villages such as Hadjin and Zeitun, two mountainous areas where autonomy was maintained until the 19th century. In ports and cities of the Adana plain, commerce and industry were almost entirely in the hands of the Armenians and they remained so thanks to a constant influx of Armenians from the highlands. Their population was continuously increasing in numbers in Cilicia in contrast to other parts of the Ottoman Empire, where it was, since 1878, decreasing due to repression. This is true despite the fact that in 1909, Armenians were subjected to a massacre in Adana. During the 1915 Armenian genocide, the Armenians of Zeitun had organized a successful resistance against the Ottoman onslaught. In order to finally subjugate Zeitun, the Ottomans had to resort to treachery by forcing an Armenian delegation from Marash to ask the \"Zeituntsi\"-s to put down their arms. Both the Armenian delegation, and later, the inhabitants of Zeitun, were left with no choice.\n\nFrom December 1918 to October 1921, after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, the French controlled Cilicia. Measures were taken to repopulate the region with survivors of the Armenian Genocide. More than 170,000 Armenian refugees, the majority of whom were originally from Cilicia, were to be taken back to their homes by the French and British. The Armenians formed the Armenian National Union which acted as an unofficial Cilician Armenian government composed of the four major political parties and three Armenian religious denominations. However, rivalries between the French and British and Kemalist incursions shattered Armenian aspirations for an autonomous Cilicia. On October 21, 1921, France signed the Treaty of Ankara with the Kemalists and relinquished Cilicia to Turkey.\n\nThe region become part of the Republic of Turkey in 1921 with the signing of the Treaty of Ankara. The modern Turkish provinces Mersin, Adana, and Osmaniye are located in former Cilicia.\n\nGreek mythology mentions another Cilicia, as a small region situated immediately southeast of the Troad in northwestern Anatolia, facing the Gulf of Adramyttium. The connection (if any) between this Cilicia and the better-known and well-defined region mentioned above is unclear. This Trojan Cilicia is mentioned in Homer's \"Iliad\" and Strabo's \"Geography\", and contained localities such as Thebe, Lyrnessus and Chryse (home to Chryses and Chryseis). These three cities were all attacked and sacked by Achilles during the Trojan War.\n\nIn \"Prometheus Bound\" (v 353), Aeschylus mentions the Cilician caves (probably Cennet and Cehennem), where the earth-born, hundred-headed monster Typhon dwelt before he withstood the gods and was stricken and charred by Zeus's thunderbolt.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31009663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31009663", "title": "Controversies relating to the Six-Day War", "text": "Controversies relating to the Six-Day War\n\nThe Six-Day War was fought between June 5 and June 10, 1967, by Israel and the neighboring states of Egypt [known then as the United Arab Republic (UAR)], Jordan, and Syria. The war began with a large-scale surprise air strike by Israel on Egypt and ended with a major victory by Israel. A number of controversies have arisen out of the causes and conduct of the war, namely: whether Israel's action was a preemptive strike justified by the threat of an imminent attack by the Arab states or an unjustified and unprovoked attack; whether the Egyptians killed stragglers from their own forces as they returned from the defeat; whether the Israelis killed unarmed Egyptian prisoners; and the extent of foreign support given to the combatants in the war.\n\nInitially, both Egypt and Israel announced that they had been attacked by the other country. Gideon Rafael, the Israeli Ambassador to the UN, received a message from the Israeli foreign office: \"inform immediately the President of the Sec. Co. that Israel is now engaged in repelling Egyptian land and air forces.\" At 3:10 am, Rafael woke ambassador Hans Tabor, the Danish President of the Security Council for June, with the news that Egyptian forces had \"moved against Israel\". and that Israel was responding to a \"cowardly and treacherous\" attack from Egypt…\" At the Security Council meeting of June 5, both Israel and Egypt claimed to be repelling an invasion by the other, and \"Israeli officials – Eban and Evron – swore that Egypt had fired first\".\n\nOn June 5 Egypt, supported by the USSR, charged Israel with aggression. Israel claimed that Egypt had struck first, telling the council that \"in the early hours of this morning Egyptian armoured columns moved in an offensive thrust against Israel’s borders. At the same time Egyptian planes took off from airfields in Sinai and struck out towards Israel. Egyptian artillery in the Gaza strip shelled the Israel villages of Kissufim, Nahal-Oz and Ein Hashelosha...\" In fact, this was not the case, The US Office of Current Intelligence \"...soon concluded that the Israelis – contrary to their claims – had fired first\" and it is now known the war started by a surprise Israeli attack against Egypt's air forces that left its ground troops vulnerable to further Israeli air strikes.\n\nThough Israel had struck first, Israel initially claimed that it was attacked first. Later it claimed that its attack was a preemptive strike in the face of a planned invasion. Israel justifies its preemptive action with a review of the context of its position: Economic strangulation through the shipping blockade in the Straits of Tiran (90% of Israeli oil passed through the Straits of Tiran), the imminence of war on three fronts (hundreds of thousands of enemy troops and hundreds of tanks massed on its borders), and possible social and economic difficulty of maintaining a civilian army draft indefinitely. According to Israeli historian and former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, the Arabs, \"had planned the conquest of Israel and the expulsion or murder of much of its Jewish inhabitants in 1967\". Some historians state that the neighboring Arab countries had nevertheless not begun any military actions against Israel so as to warrant an attack. Along with this view, there is a small, yet significant view that the war was an effort for Israel to expand its borders. This, according to Oren, is patently incorrect: Israel had little choice in the matter. \"Preemption was the only option.\"\nIsrael's attack is often cited as an example of a preemptive attack and according to a journal published by the US State Department it is \"perhaps the most cited example\". One scholar has referred to Israel’s actions as an act of \"interceptive self-defense.\" According to this view, though no single Egyptian step may have qualified as an armed attack, Egypt’s collective actions that included the closure of the Straits of Tiran, the expulsion of UN peacekeepers, the massive armed deployment along Israel’s borders and her constant saber rattling, made clear that Egypt was bent on armed attack against Israel. In 2002 radio broadcast NPR correspondent Mike Shuster stated that \"[t]he prevailing view among historians is that although Israel struck first, the Israeli strike was defensive in nature.\"\n\nOren has acknowledged that both US and Israeli intelligence indicated that troop movements in Egypt, taken by themselves, had only defensive, not offensive, purposes. However, he notes that the deployed Egyptian troops in the Sinai would move against Israel in the event that Israel undertook an invasion of Syria toward Damascus in response to repeated provocations by Syrian materiel and raids by fedayeen operating in Syrian territory. This fact was mentioned by Israeli PM Menachem Begin, who, in order to argue for an Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the 80s, reminded the Israeli Knesset that preemptive strikes were already part of Israel's history and that waiting for her enemies to choose the time of coordinated warfare is a losing policy, remarking in regards to the 1967 war that, \"The Egyptian army concentrations in the Sinai approaches do not prove that Nasser was really about to attack us. (...) We decided to attack him\". But, he added in that speech, the 1967 war was not an act of aggression, but of response to multiple acts of aggression designed to debilitate Israel step by step as a preliminary to outright war.\nThe Arab view was that it was an unjustified attack. M. A. El Kony, Permanent Representative of the United Arab Republic (Egypt), remarked at a UN session that \"Israel has committed a treacherous premeditated aggression against the United Arab Republic...While we in the United Arab Republic...have declared our intention not to initiate any offensive action and have fully co-operated in the attempts that were made to relieve the tension in the area\". After the war, Israeli officials admitted that Israel wasn't expecting to be attacked when it initiated hostilities against Egypt. Mordechai Bentov, an Israeli cabinet minister who attended the June 4th Cabinet meeting, called into question the idea that there was a \"danger of extermination\" saying that it was \"invented of whole cloth and exaggerated after the fact to justify the annexation of new Arab territories.\" Israel received reports from the United States to the effect that Egyptian deployments were defensive and anticipatory of a possible Israeli attack, and the US assessed that if anything, it was Israel that was pressing to begin hostilities. Abba Eban, Israel's foreign minister during the war, later wrote in his autobiography that Nasser's assurances he wasn't planning to attack Israel were credible: \"Nasser did not want war. He wanted victory without war.\" Israeli military historian Martin van Creveld has written that while the exact origins of the war may never be known, Israel's forces were \"spoiling for a fight and willing to go to considerable lengths to provoke one\". According to James Thuo Gathii, Israel's case did not meet the Caroline test for anticipatory self-defence, but it was the closest attack ever to the Caroline test.\n\nHowever, Israel also maintains that its attacks were justified by the Egyptian closure of the Straits of Tiran, an international waterway, the closure of which constituted a casus belli under customary international law later codified in 1958 Geneva Conventions on the Law of the Sea. However, since the UAR and its Arab allies were not signatories to the 1958 Geneva Conventions, they argued that since the Gulf of Aqaba was not a waterway connecting two regions of open sea, it was not technically a strait, and therefore that it was not covered by the 1949 ICJ decision ruling that a country is required to allow passage through a strait. Moreover, the UAR disputed Israel's legal right to Eilat, which had been captured after the 1949 armistice imposed by the Security Council. However, the United States and the Western European nations agreed with the Israeli interpretation that Israeli vessels had a right of passage through the Straits of Tiran. On the other hand, Egypt's position was supported by much of the third world.\n\nFollowing the war little remained of Egypt’s seven divisions deployed in Sinai. Thousands of Egyptian soldiers became stragglers and tried desperately to make their way westward toward the Suez Canal zone. Israel did not have the capacity to take them all prisoner and where possible, facilitated their movement toward the Canal where they would attempt to swim across. \"However, one group (of Egyptian stragglers), as they were in mid-stream, were mown down by their own forces on the far side of the Canal with machine-guns.\" It has been suggested that Nasser did not want Egypt to learn of the true extent of his defeat and thus ordered the killing of survivors who tried to escape. Other Egyptian survivors were transferred to Egypt at Qantara and once on the Egyptian side of the Canal, were herded into compounds where they were surrounded by barbed wire. Winston Churchill, the grandson of the famed former British Prime Minister, notes that Egyptian soldiers who succeeded in making their way back to Egypt, never made it home and instead were kept in cantonments, \"to prevent the spread of despondency among the civil population.\"\n\nAfter the war, a national debate ensued in Israel regarding allegations that soldiers killed unarmed Egyptians. A few soldiers said that they had witnessed the execution of unarmed prisoners. Gabby Bron, a journalist for \"Yedioth Ahronoth\", said he had witnessed the execution of five Egyptian prisoners. Michael Bar-Zohar said that he had witnessed the murder of three Egyptian POWs by a cook, and Meir Pa'il said that he knew of many instances in which soldiers had killed POWs or Arab civilians. Uri Milstein, an Israeli military historian, was reported as claiming that there were many incidents in the 1967 war in which Egyptian soldiers were killed by Israeli troops after they had raised their hands in surrender. \"It was not an official policy, but there was an atmosphere that it was okay to do it,\" Milstein said. \"Some commanders decided to do it; others refused. But everyone knew about it.\" Allegations that Egyptian soldiers fleeing into the desert were shot were confirmed in reports written after the war. Israeli historian and journalist Tom Segev, in his book \"1967\", quotes one soldier who wrote, \"our soldiers were sent to scout out groups of men fleeing and shoot them. That was the order, and it was done while they were really trying to escape\".\n\nAccording to a \"New York Times\" report of September 21, 1995, the Egyptian government announced that it had discovered two shallow mass graves in the Sinai at El Arish containing the remains of 30 to 60 Egyptian prisoners allegedly shot by Israeli soldiers during the 1967 war. Israel responded by sending Eli Dayan, a Deputy Foreign Minister, to Egypt to discuss the matter. During his visit, Dayan offered compensation to the families of victims, but explained that Israel was unable to pursue those responsible owing to its 20-year statute of limitations. The Israeli Ambassador to Cairo, David Sultan, asked to be relieved of his post after the Egyptian daily \"Al Shaab\" said he was personally responsible for the killing of 100 Egyptian prisoners, although both the Israeli Embassy and Foreign Ministry denied the charge and said that it was not even clear that Sultan had served in the military.\n\nCapt. Milovan Zorc and Miobor Stosic, a military liaison official, who were members of the Yugoslav Reconnaissance Battalion that formed part of the 3,400-strong UNEF deployed as a buffer between Egypt and Israel and witnessed the war, have cast doubt on claims that Israel executed Egyptian prisoners of war in the area where they were stationed. They said that if an Israeli unit had killed some 250 POWs near the Egyptian town of el-Arish, they would likely have come to know about it.\n\nDeclassified IDF documents show that on June 11, 1967, the operations branch of the general staff felt it necessary to issue new orders concerning the treatment of prisoners. The order read that because existing orders were contradictory:\n\nAccording to Israeli sources, 4,338 Egyptian soldiers were taken captive by IDF. Eleven Israeli soldiers were taken captive by Egyptian forces. POW exchanges were completed on January 23, 1968.\n\nAccording to George Lenczowski, as early as May 23, President Johnson secretly authorized supplying Israel by air with a variety of arms systems, even when an embargo on weapons shipments was placed on the Middle East.\n\nStephen Green wrote in his book that the United States sent reconnaissance aircraft to track nighttime movement of Egyptian ground forces in order to facilitate daytime Israeli air attacks that proved important for Israel's advances. Richard Parker disputes this and suggests that it is a hoax, based on the questionable testimony of a single man.\n\nOn the second day of the war, Arab state-run media reported that American and British troops were fighting on Israel's side. Radio Cairo and the government newspaper \"Al-Ahram\" made a number of claims, among them: that U.S. and British carrier-based aircraft flew sorties against the Egyptians; that U.S. aircraft based in Wheelus Air Base-Libya attacked Egypt; and that American spy satellites provided imagery to Israel. Mohamed Hassanein Heikal, the chief of \"Al-Ahram\" in the Nasserite period, repeated similar claims at Al Jazeera channel. Later, Muammar al-Gaddafi's Libyan government confirmed these claims also only to get a pretext for the coup that took place on 1 September 1969. The governments of the United States and Britain officially denied involvement. Similar reports were aired by Radio Damascus and Radio Amman. Egyptian media even said that King Hussein had personally seen radar observations showing British aircraft taking off from aircraft carriers.\n\nOutside of the Arab world, claims of American and British military intervention were not taken seriously. Britain, the U.S. and Israel denied these allegations. On June 8, Egyptian credibility was further damaged when Israel released an audio recording to the press, which they said was a radio-telephone conversation intercepted two days earlier between Nasser and King Hussein of Jordan.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, as the extent of the Arab military defeat became apparent, Arab leaders differed on whether to continue to assert that the American military had assisted the Israeli victory. On June 9, 1967, Nasser stated in his resignation speech (his resignation was not accepted):\n\nKing Hussein, however, later denied the allegations of American military support. On June 30, he announced in New York that he was \"perfectly satisfied\" that \"no American planes took part, or any British planes either\". In September, \"The New York Times\" reported that Nasser had privately assured Arab leaders, gathered in Sudan to discuss the Khartoum Resolution, that his earlier claims were false.\n\nNonetheless, these allegations, that the Arabs were fighting the Americans and British rather than Israel alone, took hold in the Arab world. As reported by the British Representative in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, a country at odds with Egypt as a result of the Yemen war:\n\nPresident Abdel Nasser's allegation ... is firmly believed by almost the whole Arab population here who listen to the radio or read the press ... Our broadcast denials are little heard and just not believed. The denials we have issued to the broadcasting service and press have not been published. Even highly educated persons basically friendly to us seem convinced that the allegations are true. Senior foreign ministry officials who received my formal written and oral denials profess to believe them but nevertheless appear skeptical. I consider that this allegation has seriously damaged our reputation in the Arab world more than anything else and has caused a wave of suspicion or feeling against us which will persist in some underlying form for the foreseeable future ... Further denials or attempts at local publicity by us will not dispel this belief and may now only exacerbate local feeling since the Arabs are understandably sensitive to their defeat with a sense of humiliation and resent self-justification by us who in their eyes helped their enemy to bring this about.\n\nWell after the end of the war, the Egyptian government and its newspapers continued to make claims of collusion between Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States. These included a series of weekly articles in \"Al-Ahram\", simultaneously broadcast on Radio Cairo by Mohamed Heikal. Heikal attempted to uncover the \"secrets\" of the war. He presented a blend of facts, documents, and interpretations. Heikal's conclusion was clear-cut: there was a secret U.S.-Israeli collusion against Syria and Egypt.\n\nAccording to Israeli historian Elie Podeh: \"All post-1967 [Egyptian] history textbooks repeated the claim that Israel launched the war with the support of Britain and the United States. The narrative also established a direct link between the 1967 war and former imperialist attempts to control the Arab world, thus portraying Israel as an imperialist stooge. The repetition of this fabricated story, with only minor variations, in all history school textbooks means that all Egyptian schoolchildren have been exposed to, and indoctrinated with, the collusion story.\" The following example comes from the textbook \"Al-Wisam fi at-Ta'rikh\":\n\nThe United States' role: Israel was not (fighting) on its own in the (1967) war. Hundreds of volunteers, pilots, and military officers with American scientific spying equipment of the most advanced type photographed the Egyptian posts for it (Israel), jammed the Egyptian defense equipment, and transmitted to it the orders of the Egyptian command.\n\nIn \"Six Days of War\", American-Israeli historian Michael Oren argues that the Arab leadership spread false claims about American involvement in order to secure Soviet support for the Arab side. After the war, as the extent of the Israeli victory became apparent to the Arab public, these claims helped deflect blame for the defeat away from Nasser and other Arab leaders. In reaction to these claims, Arab oil-producing countries announced either an oil embargo on the United States and Britain or suspended oil exports altogether.\n\nSix Arab countries broke off diplomatic relations with the United States, and Lebanon withdrew its Ambassador. More broadly, the Six Day War hastened the process of anti-American radicalization in the Middle East, a process expressed by the growth of both leftist and religious-fundamentalist movements and their increased resort to terrorism as a weapon in their anti-American struggle. In fact, it transcended the Arab countries and spread to Iran, Pakistan and the Third World, whose delegates at the UN began adopting increasingly critical posture toward America.\n\nA British guidance telegram to Middle East posts concluded: \"The Arabs' reluctance to disbelieve all versions of the big lie springs in part from a need to believe that the Israelis could not have defeated them so thoroughly without outside assistance.\"\n\nIn a 1993 interview for the Johnson Presidential Library oral history archives, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara revealed that a carrier battle group, the U.S. 6th Fleet, on a training exercise near Gibraltar was re-positioned towards the eastern Mediterranean to be able to defend Israel. The administration \"thought the situation was so tense in Israel that perhaps the Syrians, fearing Israel would attack them, or the Russians supporting the Syrians might wish to redress the balance of power and might attack Israel\". The Soviets learned of this deployment, which they regarded as offensive in nature, and, in a hotline message from Soviet First Secretary Alexei Kosygin, threatened the United States with war.\n\nThe Soviet Union supported its Arab allies. In May 1967, the Soviets started a surge deployment of their naval forces into the East Mediterranean. Early in the crisis they began to shadow the US and British carriers with destroyers and intelligence collecting vessels. The Soviet naval squadron in the Mediterranean was sufficiently strong to act as a major restraint on the U.S. Navy. In a 1983 interview with the \"Boston Globe\", McNamara said that \"We damn near had war\". He said Kosygin was angry that \"we had turned around a carrier in the Mediterranean\".\n\nIn his book \"Six Days,\" veteran BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen claims that on June 4, 1967, the Israeli ship \"Miryam\" left Felixstowe with cases of machine guns, 105 mm tank shells, and armored vehicles in \"the latest of many consignments of arms that had been sent secretly to Israel from British and American reserves since the crisis started\" and that \"Israeli transport planes had been running a 'shuttle service' in and out of RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire\". Bowen claims that Harold Wilson had written to Eshkol saying that he was glad to help as long as the utmost secrecy was maintained.\n\nThe USS Liberty incident was a \"friendly fire\" incident between Israeli Air Force jet fighter aircraft and Israeli Navy torpedo boats and a United States Navy technical research ship, USS Liberty, on June 8. The combined air and sea attack killed 34 crew members (naval officers, sailors, two Marines, and one civilian), wounded 174 other crew members, and severely damaged the ship. All official investigations have concluded that the attack was a case of mistaken identity; however, some reject this conclusion saying the attack was to silence the ship's intelligence-gathering communications that may have warned Egypt indirectly.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term may extend to both grey and black markets online and offline.\n\nFor many years, the burgeoning dark web market remained niche, available only to those in-the-know or well funded. Since at least 2005, western governments including the U.S., United Kingdom, Russia, France, and Israel have been buying exploits from defence contractors and individual hackers. This 'legitimate' market for zero day exploits exists but is not well advertised or immediately accessible.\n\nAttempts to openly sell zero day exploits to governments and security vendors to keep them off the black market have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nTraditional arms producers and military services companies such as BAE Systems, EADS, Leonardo, General Dynamics, Raytheon and Thales have all expanded into the cybersecurity markets. However smaller software companies such as Blue Coat and Amesys have also become involved, often drawing attention for providing surveillance and censorship technologies to the regimes of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and Muammar Gaddafi in Libya.\n\nSuppliers of exploits to western governments include the Massachusetts firm Netragard.\n\nThe trade show ISS World that runs every few months has been referred to as the 'international cyber arms bazaar' and the 'wiretappers ball' focuses on surveillance software for lawful interception.\n\nThe most popular Internet forums are generally in Russian or Ukrainian and there are reports of English-only, Chinese-only, German-only, and Vietnamese-only sites, among others. Phishing, spear-phishing, and other social engineer campaigns are typically done in English, as a majority of potential victims know that language. India's Central Bureau of Investigation describe the proliferation of underground markets as 'widespread'. Colonel John Adams, head of the Marine Corps Intelligence Activity has expressed concerns these markets could allow cyberweapony to fall into the hands of hostile governments which would otherwise lack the expertise to attack an advanced country's computer systems.\n\nOnline, there is increasing uses of encryption and privacy mechanisms such as off the record messaging and cryptocurrencies.\n\nSince 2005 on darknet markets and black markets such as the 'Cyber Arms Bazaar' have had their prices dropping fast with the cost of cyberweapony plummeting at least 90 percent.\n\nBotnets are increasingly rented out by cyber criminals as commodities for a variety of purposes.\n\nRDP shops offer cheap access to hacked computers.\n\nIn recent years many software firms have had success with bug bounty programs, but in some cases such as with Vupen's Chrome exploit these will be rejected as below market value. Meanwhile, some vendors such as HP spent more than $7 million between 2005 and 2015 buying exploits for their own software. This behaviour has been criticised by head of the United States Cyber Command, General Keith Alexander as 'building the black market'\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32479114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32479114", "title": "Elsie Paroubek", "text": "Elsie Paroubek\n\nEliška \"Elsie\" Paroubek (1906–1911) was a Czech American girl who was a victim of kidnapping and murder in the spring of 1911. Her disappearance and the subsequent search for her preoccupied Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota law enforcement for six weeks. Her funeral was attended by between 2000 and 3000 people.\n\nThe story of the girl's death, and especially her photograph in the \"Chicago Daily News\", were inspirations for Henry Darger's immense fantasy novel \"The Story of the Vivian Girls\".\n\nElsie's mother, Karolína Vojáčková, was born on November 26, 1869, in village Míčov (Meconi), eastern Bohemia, in what is now the Czech Republic. Elsie's father, František (Frank) Paroubek, was born on November 15, 1867. His father's name was Jan.\n\nFrank came to the U.S. at the age of fifteen and returned to native Bohemia between 1882 and 1892. He and Karolína were married there in 1892. In the United States, Frank worked as a painter while Karolina maintained the home. Eliška (Elsie) was their seventh child. In newspaper accounts, particularly in the \"Chicago Daily News,\" Paroubek is frequently spelled \"Parobek.\" Frank is sometimes referred to as \"Peter\" or \"John,\" and Karolina is sometimes called \"Mary.\" Elsie is also called \"Mary\" or \"Emily\" in the Rockford, Illinois newspapers.\n\nOn the morning of April 8, 1911, Elsie Paroubek left her home at 2320 S. Albany Avenue in Chicago, telling her mother she was going to visit \"Auntie\", Karolina's sister Julia Trampota, around the corner at 2325 S. Troy Street. Turning left on 22nd St. and left again on Troy, she encountered her nine-year-old cousin, Josie Trampota, and a number of other children who were listening to an organ grinder a short distance from Mrs. Trampota's gate. When the organ grinder moved to the 23rd St. corner, the children followed him, but subsequently left while Elsie remained behind. Several hours later, Elsie's mother went to her sister's house to find Elsie had never arrived. As Elsie had many friends in the area, the women assumed she was visiting at another home, perhaps to spend the night and return the next morning. At 9pm that evening, Frank Paroubek returned from work and went to police at the Hinman Street station to report her missing. Police initially agreed that she was likely spending the night with friends, but when she had not returned by the following morning, Captain John Mahoney took personal charge of the search.\n\nRomani people, as identified by the Rockford, Illinois press, were suspected after a neighborhood child, John Jirowski, told detectives from the Maxwell Street station led by inspector Stephen K. Healey that he had seen a gypsy wagon on Kedzie Ave., a block west of Troy Street, with two women holding a little girl. The Chicago \"American\" repeated this story with the added detail that the girl seemed to be trying to get away and was being restrained; also, that police had reason to believe this was a \"Black Hand\" kidnapping.\n\nThere were several camps along the Desplaines River near Kedzie and these were sought. Residents told investigators that one wagon had decamped and left on the morning of April 9. The \"stolen by gypsies\" theory gained credence because Elsie's disappearance was almost identical to that of Lillian Wulff, who had been found with gypsies four years earlier. Elsie's father, Frank Paroubek, offered his life savings, $50 (about $1,165 today) as a reward. Inspector Healey also ordered that drainage canals be dragged for the child's body on April 15, and Governor Charles S. Deneen asked the public to aid in the search. It was at about this time that Elsie's friend Emma Kubat, 14, told police she had last seen Elsie with the organ grinder. Detectives from the Maxwell Street station searched the Italian quarter at West 14th and S. Halsted Streets, where it had been reported a child answering Elsie's description had been seen with an organ grinder.\n\nA full-length photo of Elsie appeared on the front page of the April 12 Chicago \"American\". This photo, enhanced by artists, reappeared many times in the paper. On April 17, it was accompanied by photos of Frank, Karolina and Elsie's sister Julia.\n\nDetectives Joseph, Komorous, and Sheehan accompanied Frank Paroubek in his search for the departed wagon which was initially believed to be headed for Round Lake, Illinois, a village about 50 miles northwest of Chicago, where seven wagons were camped. Farmers in the area were alerted to be on watch. When local residents started asking \"gypsies\" about Elsie and attempting to search the wagons, they broke camp again and moved on to Volo, Illinois, 43 miles from Chicago. Volo residents reported a child matching Elsie's description and said she appeared to be \"stupefied\" or \"drugged\" and partly covered with a blanket. They also attempted to search the wagons, but the \"gypsies\" immediately broke camp and departed for McHenry, Illinois, about 60 miles northwest of Chicago. When police caught up with them at McHenry, they discovered the little girl was a \"gypsy\" and did not match Elsie's description. Meanwhile, Police Capt. Mahoney assigned men to drag the drainage canals near Elsie's home on April 12 and again on the 15th.\n\nIn several instances, a child was found in a camp who did resemble Elsie, such that even Frank was momentarily certain it was his daughter and it would take some time to convince him it was a mistake. As late as April 24, when a little girl somewhat answering Elsie's description was found in a \"gypsy\" camp near 18th and South Halstead streets, Frank fell to his knees and prayed.\n\nThe reason for her capture was attributed by police to \"the natural love of the wandering people for blue-eyed, yellow-haired children\". Elsie was consistently described as small, with light golden hair and blue eyes, wearing a red one-piece dress, lace shoes (shoes with laces rather than buttons), and black stockings.\n\n\"The little girl is described as having long curly golden hair, blue eyes, and pink chubby cheeks with a prominent dimple in each. At the time she disappeared, she wore a red hat, a red dress, black stockings, and high top black boots.\" - Chicago Daily News, April 12, 1911.\n\n\"She was a very pretty child and passing strangers often stopped to pass admiring comment upon her.\" - Rockford Daily Gazette, April 21, 1911.\n\nOn April 17, Police Capt. Mahoney received an anonymous phone tip that a child answering Elsie's description had been seen accompanying a man to a Western Springs, Illinois hotel. Again, detectives dispatched to the hotel found nothing. Sycamore, Illinois police Chief Ogden accompanied Frank Paroubek to investigate \"gypsy\" wagons at Cherry Valley, Illinois, but found no child even remotely resembling Elsie. Meanwhile, Hinman Street police fielded reporters' questions about a $500 (nearly $13,000 in 2015) ransom note received by Karolina. They \"denied official knowledge of the communication, but admitted it might be true.\"\n\nOn April 20, neighbors saw Frank Jr., age 6, lugging a pick and shovel out into South Troy Street and start digging. Upon inquiry, Frank said there had been a lot of construction on the street the day Elsie disappeared, and he had heard his parents discussing the possibility that she had fallen into a hole. As she struggled to climb out, she might have been buried under falling sand and gravel. Workers still fixing the street said that it was possible, but they would have noticed immediately. Meanwhile, people in the West End and a woman in Kings, Illinois reported sightings of light-skinned girls traveling with gypsies.\nIn the second week after Elsie's disappearance, Lillian Wulff, age 11, came forward to offer assistance. Miss Wulff herself had been the subject of a similar manhunt four years earlier. She had been stolen by \"gypsies\" and held for six days, working as a beggar, until discovered walking behind a \"gypsy\" wagon by a farmer outside Momence, Illinois. She provided details of her experience of the culture's typical behavior and volunteered to lead a \"rescue party\". One of the men who had kidnapped Lillian suggested asking Elijah George, whom he said was King of the Gypsies.\n\nElijah George was found in Argyle, Wisconsin, and was brought to Joliet but \"failed to give the desired information\", and was released. At this point, Inspector Healey again ordered the drainage canal dragged, along with a search of all wells and other places where Elsie could have fallen.\n\nOn April 22, Gov. Deneen released a front-page statement to the Chicago \"American\" calling on \"every person\" to aid in the search. Also on April 22, John Muts, the town marshal for Trevor, Wisconsin, received a phone call regarding a blonde child in a nearby gypsy camp. Muts, along with saloonkeeper Carl Czdenek of Lyons, Illinois, met with the girl and Czdenek said he was able to speak with her in Czech and verify that she was Elsie. A Mrs. Alice Gould of nearby McHenry also identified the child as Elsie and said the \"gypsies\" had attempted to steal other children in the area.\n\nBy April 23, Lt. John Costello of the Hinman Street station told reporters that every \"kidnapping\" clue had been exhausted. He was sure Elsie had been \"attacked and mistreated\", was now dead, and her body hidden in the cellar of an empty house or deserted barn. He brought detectives to begin investigating empty buildings, barns, sheds, elevators, catchbasins, and basements on or near South Albany Avenue. Several of the detectives brought spades planning to dig in every plot of earth that appeared to have been recently disturbed. Inspector Healey joined in this search along with Detectives Perry and Egan. At the same time, Costello sent two officers to the outskirts of the city on a lead which he had received by telephone but refused to reveal to reporters. Capt. Stephen Wood of the detective bureau was having all \"gypsy\" wagons followed and wrote to every police official in the vicinity of Belvidere, Rockford and Janesville, Wisconsin to be on the lookout for Elsie. However, he too was now certain Elsie was either being held for ransom, had been in an accident and was either dead or in some hospital, unable to speak, or had been \"slain by some degenerate\" from one of the shanties in the alley near her home.\n\nAlso on April 23, a neighbor told police that she had last seen Elsie around 11 a.m. on the morning she disappeared, still with the organ grinder and engaged in conversation with a man on the opposite side of the street whom the neighbor did not know.\n\nThe following day's \"Chicago Daily News\" devoted a full column to the search, calling it \"one of the most extensive and far-reaching quests ever made for a missing child.\" Twenty police officers and one hundred volunteers were involved in Lt. Costello's search, covering a radius of about a mile of the Paroubek home. It was judged to be \"one of the most remarkable investigations of its kind\" because of the intense public interest, but also due to the huge number of child volunteers. Many described themselves not just as casual acquaintances or playmates, but as friends of Elsie. These children offered to look into \"out of the way places\" for Elsie or evidence leading to her whereabouts.\n\nOn April 29, Inspector Healey sent a detective to Zion City, Illinois in response to a long-distance phone tip from the Zion City deputy sheriff. Again, a child resembling Elsie was seen in a \"gypsy\" camp, and again the child was found to be a \"gypsy\".\n\nBy April 30, the superintendent of schools, Mrs. Ella Flagg Young, had requested that all schoolchildren in the Chicago area organize neighborhood searches during spring break. Meanwhile, Frank Paroubek, in desperation, consulted a psychic who said that Elsie was in \"Argo, Wisconsin\" (possibly meaning to say Argyle, Wisconsin).\n\nChicago politician Charles J. Vopicka sent officers to the area she indicated, to no avail. The search \"jumped from Illinois to Wisconsin, and from Wisconsin to Minnesota, and then back again to Illinois\", with no luck.\n\nA few days after Elsie's disappearance, Frank Paroubek began to receive anonymous, \"insulting\" letters. They were all written in English, which he could not read, so he asked neighbors to translate. The letters claimed that Elsie was hidden away by someone who \"hated\" the Paroubeks, accusing them of mistreating her. Frank was so infuriated by the accusation that he burned the letters. Nonetheless, Detectives Zahour and Zalasky attempted to follow up on this lead.\n\nThe Czech community rallied to support the Paroubeks. All Czech-speaking policemen were put into plain clothes and assigned to the investigation. The Chicago \"American\" revealed that not only Czech speakers were involved in this \"international squad\", but police officers Dagulski (Polish), Arens and Richter (German), McCauley (Irish) and Alexander (English) were assigned because they each spoke several languages and would be better able to question \"every man, woman and child in the camps.\" The women's auxiliary of the Club Bohemia assisted in the search, creating an \"endless chain letter\" which was mailed to all parts of the city, with a request for recipients to mail copies to everyone they knew. Various Czech-American politicians became involved. The Bohemian Charitable Association conferred with Mayor Carter Harrison, Jr. on April 22, then announced they would offer a reward of $500 (nearly $13,000 today) and however much more could be raised. Mayor Harrison contributed $25 (a little under $600 today) and sent out a special police squad from City Hall. A detachment also operated out of the Lawndale Avenue station in cooperation with the Hinman Street police. Anton Cermak, then a Chicago alderman, said that if Miss Paroubek were not found by the time of the next city council meeting May 1, he would call upon the city council to offer an even larger reward. At that time, state laws did not allow the offering of a reward for the apprehension of kidnappers as it did for murderers. On April 26, Governor Deneen said he planned to ask the legislature to revise the statutes so that a reward could be offered by the State of Illinois in addition to the personal reward fund.\n\nJudge Adolph J. Sabath held several interviews with Elsie's family and also contributed $25 (a little under $600 today) to the reward fund. By May 2, he had increased his contribution to $100 (around $2,500 in 2015) and arranged meetings with Czech societies to find ways to increase the fund.\n\nMany sightings of girls in a red dress living in a \"gypsy\" camp were phoned in to police and followed up. By May 1, police had all but abandoned the idea that she had been stolen by \"gypsies\", and were returning their efforts to searching wells and dragging canals. Judge Sabath objected saying that the police hunt was becoming \"listless\" because Elsie's parents were poor. He was being \"swamped\" with mail, most of it containing contributions to the reward fund, from all over the country, and increased his personal contribution to $100.00 (around $2,500 in 2015) as well. Among the letters was one from Dr. G.T. Screeton of Carlisle, Arkansas which read in part: \"Dear Judge: In relation to the strange disappearance of Elsie Parobek, I will say that a band of forty gypsy men and four gypsy women with eighteen children ranging in age from three months to eighteen years were seen in the union station at Little Rock, Arkansas last week. All these children looked as if they were not of gypsy parentage.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Detectives Zahour and Zalasky sought a man residing near Madison and Robey streets, the suspected author of the anonymous, threatening letters Frank Paroubek had received. Lt. Costello, supported by Inspector Healey, flatly declared: \"Elsie Paroubek fell into the drainage canal from the Kedzie Avenue bridge or near it. She was not murdered.\" They believed the author of the letters to have witnessed this.\n\nBy May 7, twenty-five \"gypsy\" bands had been searched and many false leads followed. Police Capt. Mahoney announced his belief that Elsie was dead and that police would continue to search for her body.\n\nAlso on May 7, Judge Sabath ordered an investigation of Frank and Karolina themselves, in search of anything in their past that might have caused someone to kidnap Elsie.\n\nTwo days later on May 9, 1911, electrical engineer George T. Scully and other employees of the Lockport power plant near Joliet, thirty-five miles outside of Chicago, saw a body floating in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal. At first, they thought it was an animal from one of the nearby farms, but three hours later, realizing it was a human being, sent out a boat to bring it to shore. Undertaker William Goodale, examining the body, said that it appeared to fit Miss Paroubek's description: \"The description tallied to the shade of the hair, the texture of the stockings, and the stuff and tint of the dress of little Elsie.\" He thought the body had been in the water for several weeks, although only slightly decomposed. Another report indicated that her body was \"badly decomposed\" but there were \"no marks of violence\" on her body.\n\nGoodale notified Chicago authorities who sent Police Lt. Costello to the Paroubek home. Karolina Paroubek cried \"Mé drahé dítě! (My dear child!)\" and begged to be told Elsie was alive. Frank was taken to the Goodale funeral home at midnight. He said, \"The clothes look like Elsie's. But the face -- I can't recognize it. Her mother alone can tell.\" Another newspaper reported that Frank immediately said \"That's Elsie,\" and began to cry.\n\nKarolina arrived at the funeral home by trolley car the following morning and positively identified Elsie, saying \"It's you, my darling. Thank God we've found you and you're not in the hands of the gypsies.\" For the next hour, she paced or sat nervously in an adjoining room with Frank holding her hands, weeping, and praying. Goodale, who had kept track of the disappearance in the papers, made this statement to police: \"The body appears to have been in the water for about a month, which would tally with the date of Elsie Paroubek's disappearance. The child, when she left home, was without hat, and her clothing tallies in every respect with that found on the dead body. There was no ring or other ornament, and in that respect, the descriptions correspond. Excepting only as to the color of the eyes, which cannot be clearly observed as to color, the descriptions are identical.\" \n\nArrangements were quickly made for an inquest. The jury consisted of F.W. Wurst, Christian Radchiero, John A. Walter, William Woodale, Edwin Murray, and Patrick O'Brien. Coroner William Wunderlich of Will County officiated.\n\nAs the post-mortem examination began, Frank Paroubek was the first witness. Disregarding questions put to him by the coroner, Frank plunged into charges his daughter had been murdered. Through a translator, he asserted \"I am sure the gypsies stole my girl and then when they knew we were after them, they killed her and threw her body into the canal.\"\n\nAt this, Karolina ran from the funeral parlor screaming \"My Elsie is dead. She was murdered, murdered.\" Her husband and Det. Zelasky tried to calm her, but in her extreme distress she began running up and down the street, drawing a crowd of curious onlookers. She insisted she had known for three weeks that the \"gypsies\" had killed Elsie. Frank consoled her and assisted her boarding a trolley car for home.\n\nMeanwhile, the coroner said: \"This case has attracted such attention that a minute examination will be made. We will be content with no perfunctory inquest such as this. The jury will refuse to state its convictions -- for it has none -- until after the autopsy has been held. We want the stomach of the little girl examined, and the lungs as well. The father charges murder. It is certainly possible that he is right.\" \n\nTwo physicians, E.A. Kingston and W.R. Paddock, confirmed that there was no water in her lungs, so she had not drowned. Kingston said she had been \"attacked\" (often a euphemism for rape) and murdered before her body was thrown into the water. Paddock said there was every evidence she had been \"wounded\" before being killed. Lt. Costello later told the press that she had been \"mistreated,\" seeming to indicate this meant her death was not the work of \"gypsies,\" and Inspector Healy added, \"there seems to be no doubt that she was abused in the most fiendish way, and that fact established, the case is much simplified for the police.\"\nThey also found \"deep cuts\" on the left side of her face. Although these men reported \"blue marks on the throat as though the victim had been choked,\" another examination by Drs. E.R. LeCount and Warren H. Hunter of the Coroner's Office revealed that Elsie had been suffocated, not strangled, and there were \"no distinct marks of violence on the body.\" Despite this, newspaper headlines reporting the coroners' findings continued to report Elsie as strangled. The official cause of death was marked \"unknown.\" Coroner Peter Hoffman concurred with Mr. Paroubek as to the probable circumstances of Elsie's death.\n\n\"It is our belief that the abductor of the child suffocated her to death, possibly by putting a hand over her mouth.\" The coroner's report recommended that officials continue to investigate. Inspector Healey immediately detailed detectives to find out exactly what had happened. He told the Chicago Inter Ocean: \"I have forty detectives at work today on the theory that the criminals lived in the neighborhood of the Paroubek home. We are investigating every incident of the lives of the Paroubeks since they came to Chicago in order to trace a possible enemy. It will surprise me if the criminals are not arrested within a week.\" To the Chicago Tribune he stated, \"We have one or two theories, but nothing specific enough to even talk about. I intend to place more men on the case tomorrow.\" Lt. Costello returned to investigating the anonymous letters. Meanwhile, the New York Times reported Hoffman's and Paroubek's theory as fact.\n\nOn the evening of May 9, Karolina was calmer and gave an interview upon returning home. Surrounded by friends and neighbors she told reporters, \"Before the doctors found that Elsie's lungs were free from water and discovered reasons for believing she had been strangled, I knew she had been murdered. A picture of the crime has been in my mind since the second week of her disappearance, and I am convinced that when the truth is known, as it surely will be, it will be shown that she was choked to death a week from April 8 when she was kidnapped on her way to visit her 'auntie.'\" Karolina called upon authorities to find and punish the killers.\n\nFollowing the inquest, Elsie's body was brought home. Her uncle Frank Trampota took charge of the funeral arrangements. Karolina told Judge Sabath that the search had exhausted the family's savings and they had no money to bury her. Judge Sabath gave her a check for $25 promising to raise more funds. Friends and family members continued to collect money for the Paroubek fund. Mrs. Sophie Johanes raised over $50 by giving a benefit party and soliciting donations from Bohemians on the West Coast.\n\nElsie Paroubek's funeral was held at 10:00 a.m. on May 12, 1911 on the lawn of the Paroubeks' home and attended by between 2,000 or 3,000 people. The Chicago Inter Ocean newspaper, however, gave the number of attendees as 5,000. Hours before the ceremony, Albany Avenue and the Paroubek back yard, along with the balconies and porches of nearby houses, were filled with mourners. There was no hall in the neighborhood large enough to hold them all. Frank had been offered the use of a hall, but he indicated the huge gathering and said \"They have come to say goodbye to my Elsie. Don't let them be disappointed.\" Reserves from the Hinman Street station were called in to keep order and prevent the crowd from breaking down the fence.\n\nElsie's white coffin rested on two brass stands, surrounded by lilies of the valley, roses and carnations sent by Mayor Harrison, Judge Sabath and other city officials. Eight little girls dressed all in white, including Josie Trampota and her sister Mary, brought out huge sprays of lilies and roses and encircled the bier. Someone brought two chairs out of the Paroubek home, set them near the casket, and laid a board across them to hold the hundreds of floral offerings. Karolina was seated at the head of the coffin, while Frank and the other children stood nearby.\nAs the Paroubeks were not Catholics but freethinkers, there were no prayers, and the service was read by Rudolf Jaromír Pšenka, editor of the Bohemian \"Chicago Daily Svornost.\" He spoke of the need to cooperate with police to find Elsie's killers. As the undertaker went to lift the coffin into the hearse, Karolina begged him to open it so she could see Elsie's face once more, but her relatives persuaded her not to insist on this and led her away. Most of the attendees followed Elsie's casket to Bohemian National Cemetery, where Pšenka gave another address.\n\nFrank Paroubek was quoted as saying, \"My little girl is at rest and nothing matters to her now, but I shall never rest until I see her murderers paying the penalty for taking her life.\"\nPolice Chief John McWeeny vowed to devote the entire Chicago police force to finding the killer. Alderman Cermak asked Governor Deneen to increase the reward by $200, \"as is possible under the statutes.\" Cermak said, \"I will also ask the governor to issue a proclamation calling upon all the people of the state to interest themselves in this case in order that her murderer be apprehended.\" Coroner Peter Hoffman started a public reward fund, contributing $25.\n\nConsidering where Elsie was found, detectives suspected the actual killer might be Joseph Konesti. According to the Rockford Republic, Konesti was definitely identified as the killer by detectives under the command of Police Capt. Wood. Described as a \"bearded Bohemian\" and a \"hermit peddler\", he was said to have \"frequently enticed little girls to his hut by the drainage canal,\" on West 33rd St. and South Kedzie Ave., about a mile and a half from Elsie's home, and had \"frequently been seen near the Paroubek home.\" Searching the shack, detectives found a green hair ribbon which they intended to bring to Karolina for identification, along with \"indications of a small hole dug in the ground\" and \"an old hemp sack, which might have contained the body.\" The owner of the shack, Mrs. David Shaughnessy advised police that she had complained to Konesti about his \"bringing children around the house,\" and had evicted him on May 9. Konesti threw himself in front of a train on May 10. Five days later he was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nOn May 13, the body of a well-dressed man was found in the canal at Willow Springs, some 20 miles from Lockport and 14 miles from Albany Avenue. He had no identification, only a Catholic holy card with a prayer in Polish, with the words \"Sig. Hoff\" written on it. Detectives believed this man also may have had some connection with Elsie's death. An anonymous letter was said to have been received by the detectives. The writer described having seen a little girl walking along the canal with a young man the day Elsie disappeared. On the same day, another loner living in a shack by the canal was identified as a possible person of interest. Mr. Kinsella, described as a \"religious enthusiast,\" was \"supposed to be demented.\" When he saw Detectives Gormley, Slad, and Froenicke approaching his home, he took off running, \"making a move as if to draw a revolver.\" Calling out that they only wanted to question him, the officers fired their weapons into the air. After a three-mile chase through gullies and underbrush, Kinsella escaped into the forest.\n\nOn May 15, Frank Paroubek told police he had spoken to a man he did not know who told him he had seen Elsie late in the afternoon of April 8 on Kedzie Avenue, south of 28th St., long after she was supposed to have been taken by the \"gypsies.\" Lt. Costello assigned detectives to find the man. The previous reported sighting of Elsie had her walking toward the canal on South Troy St., a half block south of her aunt's house. If the unknown man told the truth, Elsie was only three blocks away from a bridge. Despite the coroner's findings, Lt. Costello had become convinced that Elsie's death was an accident and that she had simply fallen into the canal, although Inspector Healey had had the canals and drainage ditches dragged repeatedly during the search. Coroner Hoffman continued to insist Elsie was murdered. Apparently some confusion had occurred during the initial examinations. The first physician (probably Dr. Kingston) to examine Elsie on the night of May 9 told Lt. Costello that she had drowned, with no marks of abuse, and Costello had repeated this when he spoke to the family. However, the following day, the same physician's autopsy findings concluded Elsie had not drowned and that she appeared to have been suffocated.\n\nDetectives surrounded a house near Madison and Robey Streets, and threw a dragnet over the southwestern side of town for a former boarder in the Paroubek home. They continued to search for the anonymous writer of the nasty letters received by Frank Paroubek. Apparently neither the boarder, the writer, or the unknown man who had spoken to Frank were ever found. No one knows what really happened to Elsie Paroubek.\n\nTwo years later, on the anniversary of Elsie's funeral, Frank Paroubek died. He was forty-five years old. Karolina lived until December 9, 1927. Both are buried with Elsie in Bohemian National Cemetery.\n\nAlthough Elsie's mysterious disappearance and death were once the subject of intense police investigation and journalistic focus, her story faded into obscurity until the death of Henry Darger in 1973. Michael Bonesteel, an art historian examining Darger's work, found repeated reference in Darger's \"Story of the Vivian Girls\" novel to Annie Aronburg, leader of a child slave rebellion, and to an inspirational picture of her that had been lost. Miss Aronburg had met a shocking yet heroic death at the hands of her captors. (The murder is described in detail, and is nothing like Elsie's death.) According to his diary, Darger really had lost a picture of a little girl and was desperate to get it back or replace it. He did not give the name but said it had appeared in the \"Chicago \"Daily Noise\" (sic), May, June, or July, 1911.\" Bonesteel's search in the newspaper archives revealed Elsie Paroubek and her story. A portrait of Annie Aronburg by Darger shows a somewhat older blonde-haired girl. Her hair ribbon and the distinctive collar of her dress are similar to Elsie's in the photograph. In the novel, Darger describes children who are kidnapped and mistreated by adults, while the heroic little Vivians, Annie Aronburg and others form \"rescue squads\" to save them.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "923091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=923091", "title": "Enna", "text": "Enna\n\nEnna (Sicilian: \"Castrugiuvanni\"; Greek: ; Latin: \"Henna\" and less frequently \"Haenna\") is a city and \"comune\" located roughly at the center of Sicily, southern Italy, in the province of Enna, towering above the surrounding countryside. It has earned the nicknames \"belvedere\" (panoramic viewpoint) and \"ombelico\" (navel) of Sicily.\n\nAt above sea level, Enna is the highest Italian provincial capital. Until 1926 the town was known as Castrogiovanni.\n\nEnna is situated near the center of the island; whence the Roman writer Cicero called it \"Mediterranea maxime\", reporting that it was within a day's journey of the nearest point on all the three coasts. The peculiar situation of Enna is described by several ancient authors, and is one of the most remarkable in Sicily. The ancient city was placed on the level summit of a gigantic hill, surrounded on all sides with precipitous cliffs almost wholly inaccessible. The few paths were easily defended, and the city was abundantly supplied with water which gushes from the face of the rocks on all sides. With a plain or table land of about 5 km in circumference on the summit, it formed one of the strongest natural fortresses in the world.\n\nArchaeological excavations have revealed artifacts dating from the 14th century BC, proving human presence in the area since Neolithic times. A settlement from before the 11th century BC, assigned by some to the Sicanians, has been identified at the top of the hill; later it was a center of the Sicels.\n\nIn historical times, Enna became renowned in Sicily and Italy for the cult of the goddess Demeter (the Roman Ceres). Her grove was known as the \"umbilicus Siciliae\" (\"The navel of Sicily\"). Ceres' temple in Henna was a famed site of worship.\n\nThe origin of the toponym \"Henna\" remains obscure.\n\nDionysius I of Syracuse repeatedly attempted to take over Enna. At first he encouraged Aeimnestus, a citizen of Enna, to seize the sovereign power. Afterward Dionysius I turned against him and assisted the Ennaeans to get rid of their despot. But it was not till a later period that, after repeated expeditions against the neighbouring Sicilian cities, Dionysius took control of by betrayal.\n\nAgathocles later controlled Enna. When the Agrigentines under Xenodicus began to proclaim the restoration of the other cities of Sicily to freedom, the Ennaeans were the first to join their standard, and opened their gates to Xenodicus, 309 BC. Accounts of the First Punic War repeatedly refer to Enna; it was taken first by the Carthaginians under Hamilcar, and subsequently recaptured by the Romans, but in both instances by treachery and not by force.\n\nIn the Second Punic War, while Marcellus was engaged in the siege of Syracuse (214 BC), Enna became the scene of a fearful massacre. The defection of several Sicilian towns from Rome had alarmed Pinarius the governor of Enna. In order to forestall any treachery, he used the Roman garrison to kill the citizens, whom he had gathered in the theater, and killed them all. The soldiers were allowed to plunder the city.\n\nEighty years later Enna was the center of the First Servile War in Sicily (134 BC-132 BC), which erupted under the lead of Eunus, a former slave. His forces took over Enna. It was the last place that held out against the proconsul Rupilius, and was at length betrayed into his hands. According to Strabo, the city suffered much damage after the Romans regained control. He believed this was the start of its decline.\n\nCicero referred to it repeatedly in a way to suggest that it was still a flourishing municipal town: it had a fertile territory, well-adapted for the growth of cereal grains, and was diligently cultivated till it was rendered almost desolate by the exactions of Verres. From this time little is known about Enna: Strabo speaks of it as still inhabited, though by a small population, in his time: and the name appears in Pliny among the municipal towns of Sicily, as well as in Ptolemy and the \"Itineraries\".\n\nWhen the Roman Empire was divided in 395AD, Sicily became part of the Western Roman Empire. The noted senatorial family of the Nicomachi had estates in Sicily. Around 408 the politician and grammarian Nicomachus Flavianus worked on an edition of the first 10 books of Livy during a stay on his estate in Enna. This was recorded in the subscriptions of the manuscripts of Livy.\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Enna flourished throughout the Middle Ages as an important Byzantine stronghold. In 859, in the course of the Islamic conquest of Sicily, after several attempts and a long siege, the town was taken by Muslim troops, who entered one by one through a sewer to breach the town's defenses. Afterwards, 8,000 residents of the city were massacred by Muslim forces. The Arabic name for the city, \"Qas'r Ianni\" (Fort of John), was a combination of \"qas'r\" (a corruption of the Latin \"\"castrum\",\" fort), and \"\"Ianni\",\" a corruption of \"Henna\". The city retained its name in the native dialect of Sicily as Castro Janni (Castrogiovanni) until Benito Mussolini ordered renaming in 1927.\n\nThe Normans captured Enna in 1087. Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, established a summer residence here, which is now called the \"Torre di Federico\" (\"Frederick Tower\"). Troops of North Italian soldiers, from regions such as Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria and Emilia-Romagna, came to settle in the city and neighbouring towns such as Nicosia and Piazza Armerina. Gallo-Italic dialects are still spoken in these areas, dating from this early occupation.\n\nEnna had a prominent role in the Sicilian Vespers that led to the Aragonese conquest of Sicily, and thenceforth enjoyed a short communal autonomy. King Frederick III of Sicily favored it and embellished the city; it suffered a period of decay under the Spanish domination. It was restored as provincial capital in the 1920s. In 2002 it became a university city.\n\nThe citizens of the city have a high incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS), a disease seen more frequently among people of North European extraction; perhaps this is related to the Norman immigration. MS is also prevalent in Sardinia, which has the second highest incidence in the Mediterranean basin.\n\nThe neighborhood of Enna is celebrated in myth as the place whence Persephone (Latin: Proserpine) was carried off by Pluto, god of the underworld. The spot assigned by local tradition as the scene of this event was a small lake surrounded by lofty and precipitous hills, about 8 km from Enna. The meadows abound in flowers, and a nearby cavern or grotto was believed to be where the king suddenly emerged. This lake is called \"Pergus\" by Ovid and Claudian. Neither Cicero nor Diodorus refers to any lake in relation to this myth. The former says that around Enna were \"lacus lucique plurimi, et laetissimi flores omni tempore anni.\" Diodorus describes the spot whence Persephone was carried off as a meadow so full of fragrant flowers that hounds could not follow their prey. He described the meadow as enclosed on all sides by steep cliffs, and having groves and marshes in the neighborhood, but does not refer to a lake. Both he and Cicero allude to a cavern, as if describing a definite site. In the 21st century, a small lake is found in a basin-shaped hollow surrounded by great hills, and a cavern near is noted as that described by Cicero and Diodorus. But much of the flowers and trees had disappeared by the 19th century, when travelers described the area as bare and desolate.\n\nBoth Ceres and Persephone were worshipped in Enna. Cicero said that the temple of Ceres was of such great antiquity and sanctity that Sicilians went there filled with religious awe. Verres looted from it a bronze image of the deity, the most ancient as well as the most venerated in Sicily. No remains of this temple are now visible. Standing on the brink of the brink of the precipice, it fell with a great rockfall from the edge of the cliff. Other remnants of classical antiquity were likely destroyed by the Saracens, who erected the castle and several other of the most prominent buildings of the modern city.\n\nCoins minted for Enna under the Roman dominion still exist, carrying the legend \"MUN. (Municipium) HENNA\". The aspirated form of the name confirms the authority of Cicero, whose manuscripts give that form. The most ancient Greek coin of the city also gives the name \"ΗΕΝΝΑΙΟΝ\". Scholars have concluded that this form, Henna, of the ancient name is the more correct for its time, though Enna is the more usual.\n\nEnna is now an important center for archaeological and educational studies. The Kore University of Enna was officially founded in 2002.\n\nThe most important monuments of Enna are:\n\n\nLake Pergusa (Latin: \"Pergus lacus\" or \"Hennaeus lacus\") lies between a group of mountains in the chain of Erei, about 5 km from Enna. It is part of an important migratory flyway for many species of birds. The Pergusa nature reserve also has numerous species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates.\n\nAround the lake is the most important racing track of Southern Italy, the Autodromo di Pergusa. It has hosted international competitions and events, such as Formula One, Formula 3000, and a Ferrari Festival featuring Michael Schumacher.\n\nNear Pergusa lake is the archaeological site known as \"Cozzo Matrice.\" These are the remains of an ancient prehistoric fortified village, with walls dating about 8000 BC. Other remains, dating to more than 2000 years ago, are a sacred citadel, a rich necropolis, and the remains of an ancient temple dedicated to Demeter.\nPergusa is strongly linked to the myth of the Greek Persephone, Demeter's daughter, who was kidnapped from here by Pluto and taken to Hades, the underworld, for part of the year. From that captivity, seasons arose.\n\nThe important forest and green area named \"Selva Pergusina\" (meaning Pergusa's Wood) surrounds a part of the Lake Pergusa Valley.\n\nThe Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Csa\" (Mediterranean Climate).\n\n"}
{"id": "16019180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16019180", "title": "Fitna (film)", "text": "Fitna (film)\n\nFitna () is a 2008 short film by Dutch parliamentarian Geert Wilders. Approximately 17 minutes in length, the film attempts to demonstrate that the Qur'an motivates its followers to hate all who violate Islamic teachings. The movie shows selected excerpts from Suras of the Qur'an, interspersed with media clips and newspaper cuttings showing or describing acts of violence and/or hatred by Muslims.\n\nThe film argues that Islam encourages – among other things – acts of terrorism, antisemitism, violence against women, violence and subjugation of infidels and against homosexuals and Islamic universalism. A large part of the film details the influence of Islam on the Netherlands. The film was published on the Internet in 2008. Shortly before its release, its announcement was suspended from its website by the American provider because of the perceived controversy. It stirred a still continuing debate in the Netherlands as well as abroad.\n\nThe Arabic title-word \"fitna\" means \"disagreement and division among people\" or a \"test of faith in times of trial\". Wilders, a prominent critic of Islam, described the film as \"a call to shake off the creeping tyranny of Islamisation\".\n\nOn 27 March 2008, \"Fitna\" was released to the Internet on the video sharing website LiveLeak in Dutch and English versions. The following day, LiveLeak removed the film from their servers, citing serious threats to their staff. On 30 March, \"Fitna\" was restored on LiveLeak following a security upgrade, only to be removed again shortly afterwards by Wilders himself because of copyright violations. A second edition was released later.\n\nThe Friends of the Party for Freedom (PVV) foundation commissioned the film. It contracted a production company credited in the film as \"Scarlet Pimpernel Productions\", a pseudonym adopted out of fear of reprisal. In fact large parts of the documentary \"\" written by Wayne Kopping and Raphael Shore were copied.\n\nThe exact nature of \"Fitna\"s release was uncertain up until its official launch. This was due to concerns of the legality of its content and anticipated acts of terrorism. The Dutch press centre Nieuwspoort offered to release the film, on the condition that Wilders would pay for the increased security required during the press conference and the weeks after it. Wilders declined to do so, citing prohibitive costs.\n\nHaving failed to successfully negotiate a transmission of the film with any Dutch television station, Wilders created a website, \"www.fitnathemovie.com\", on 5 March 2008 with the intention of releasing the film. However, this was subsequently suspended (see below).\n\nOn 22 March, the (NMO) offered to air the film, on the proviso that it could be previewed for any possible illegal material and that Wilders would take part in a debate with proponents and opponents afterwards. Wilders declined, quoted as saying \"No way, NMO.\"\n\nWilders released the film on 27 March 2008 on the video website LiveLeak. The following day, LiveLeak removed the film from their servers after receiving threats that they described as being \"of a very serious nature\". The film soon appeared on various BitTorrent and video sharing websites.\n\nLiveLeak reinstated \"Fitna\" on 30 March, after security upgrades offering increased protection to its staff had been implemented. Soon after, Wilders withdrew the film to make some minor edits, such as removing the copyrighted \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons and the photograph of Salah Edin, a rapper wrongly identified as Mohammed Bouyeri, in response to lawsuits. Kurt Westergaard, the cartoonist, was pleased with the news and believed the lawsuit would be dropped. In September 2008, Wilders agreed to pay Westergaard 7500 euros for using his \"Jyllands-Posten\" cartoon without permission.\n\nA revised edition, containing a new cartoon in place of the contentious one, and a corrected picture of Bouyeri, was released on LiveLeak on 6 April.\n\nOn 14 December 2008, a conference entitled \"Facing Jihad\" was organized at the Menachem Begin Heritage Center in Jerusalem. Geert Wilders, Arieh Eldad, Robert Spencer, Itamar Marcus, Daniel Pipes, Shlomo Sharan, and John David Lewis were in attendance. During the conference, \"Fitna\" was put on view and distributed to all conference attendees; it was announced that it would be shown in several European parliaments. The Ruder Finn PR company organized the conference and set up the group's website, and are also actively distributing the film. Finn distributed the film for free.\n\nDuring February 2009, Geert Wilders visited (or planned to visit) several European capitals to present the Fitna. He was barred from entering the UK, but his film was nonetheless shown in the House of Lords. Wilders also presented \"Fitna\" in Rome on 13 February 2009. The press releases to promote the showing in both cases was done by Ruder Finn.\n\nThe film shows a selection of Suras from the Qur'an, interspersed with newspaper clippings and media clips with \"The Arabian Dance\" and \"Åses død\" as an underscore.\n\nWilders said the 15-minute film shows how verses from the Qur'an are being used today to incite modern Muslims to behave violently and anti-democratically based on those verses. He later described the film as \"a call to shake off the creeping tyranny of Islamization\", and a push for a \"Leidcultuur\", a culture that \"draws on Christian, Jewish, humanistic traditions and that poses a challenge to the Islamic problem\".\n\nThe film starts with a warning to the viewer that the film contains \"very shocking images\". A caricature of the Prophet Muhammad with a bomb on his head is shown next to a timer counting down from 15 minutes.\n\nSuras are juxtaposed to video clips of Imams stating Islamic teaching, and videos of violent atrocities committed in the name of Islam, including major terrorist attacks.\n\nThe first Sura of the film, Al-Anfal verse 60, is translated as: Footage of the September 11 attacks is shown, followed by the Madrid train bombings. Imam Abu Hamza al-Masri rises above the smoke and declares \"Allah is happy when non-muslims get killed.\" Stills taken from the 7 July 2005 London bombings show an exploded bus and the underground train.\n\nThe next Sura, An-Nisa verse 56, is shown as a justification for Islamic antisemitism. Sheikh Bakr Al-Samarai is shown raising a sword while declaring: \"If Allah permits us, O nation of Mohammed, even the stone will say O Muslim. A Jew is hiding behind me, come and cut off his head. And we shall cut off his head! By Allah, we shall cut it off! O Jews! Allahu Akbar! Jihad for the sake of Allah!\" An auditorium of several hundred people respond with approving chants and fist shaking.\n\nFollowing this, a three-year-old Muslim girl, says that Jews are \"apes and pigs\" because \"Allah\" said so \"in the Qur'an\" in an interview on Iqraa TV. More antisemitism is shown by an unidentified Imam, who says: \"The Jews are Jews. They are the ones who must be butchered and killed.\" Child soldiers in uniform are shown holding guns.\n\nSura 47, verse 4 is shown in relation to the murder of Dutch film director Theo Van Gogh, committed by Mohammed Bouyeri. Bouyeri is reported as saying: \"If I had the opportunity to get out of prison, and I had the opportunity to do it again, what I did on November 2nd, Allah I would have done exactly the same\". Protesters are shown supporting Van Gogh's murder, warning others to heed the lesson or \"pay with your blood\".\n\nDutch newspaper headlines are reproduced, outlining intimidating threats of murder to prominent critics of Islam, followed by footage of Eugene Armstrong's beheading. Armstrong's disembodied head is shown held up by Al-Qaeda terrorists.\n\nSura 4, verse 89 is heard, and translated here as: This is shown through a vox populi: \"If someone converts to Christianity, he deserves the death penalty\", which refers to the punishment of death for apostasy in Islam. An unidentified Imam declares: \"Islam is (more) superior than the Jews, than the Christians, than the Buddhists, than the Hindus. The only (law) Allah accepts is Islam.\" A short video clip shows ethnic Albanians attacking a Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo during the 2004 unrest.\n\nHeadlines concerning assaults and death threats to former Muslims Ehsan Jami, Salman Rushdie and Ayaan Hirsi Ali are shown.\n\nThe final Sura used in the film is Sura 8, verse 39: \n\nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran is quoted as saying:\n\nThe final segment of the film deals with issues related to Islam in the Netherlands, under the heading: \"The Netherlands under the spell of Islam\". These issues include opposition to democracy, Islamic views on homosexuality and women's treatment in Islam.\n\nAn unidentified person claims that \"The mosque will be part of the system of the government of Holland\", in an apparent refusal to accept liberal democracy. Wilders juxtaposes a newspaper headline \"Cabinet: no ban on burqa\" against a Muslim woman fully covered up. A graph illustrating the number of Muslims in the Netherlands since 1909 is shown against a background of Muslim women. Dutch police are shown removing their shoes before entering a mosque. A Dutch Muslim expresses his desire to enact an honour killing, if his mother or sister commits \"zina\", the Islamic concept of extramarital sex. Another condemns homosexuality, saying \"Islam considers something like that a crime\".\n\nA postcard is shown, ostensibly from the Netherlands, with pictures of mosques in place of visitor attractions, with the words \"Groeten uit Nederland\" (\"Greetings from the Netherlands\") superimposed.\n\nAudio recordings that are said to have been taken from mosques in the Netherlands show Imams denouncing political parties, \"worldly concepts like liberalism [and] democracy\". Another states that female adulterers must be \"stoned\" to death, even when the man commits the adultery. A graphic image of gays being hanged, under Sharia law is a depiction of a possible future dystopian Netherlands. A series of clips show female genital cutting, a woman's disembodied head lying on a floor, and a burqa-clad woman being shot through the head by a man.\n\nFinally, a succession of newspaper headlines are shown, containing stories related to Islam in the Netherlands, their views, actions, ambitions and politics. Some verified headlines are:\n\nThe film ends with a hand seen gripping a page of the Qur'an and a call to action from Wilders to defeat \"Islamic ideology\", likening it to Communism and Nazism.\n\nThe following Suras are mentioned in \"Fitna\" in order of appearance. The translation is from Pickthall's \"The Meaning of the Glorious Koran\". Only the passages marked as bold are included in the quotations in the film, while the related passages are omitted.\n\nSurat Al-Anfal (\"The Spoils of War\") 8:60–61\n\nMake ready for them all thou canst of (armed) force and of horses tethered, that thereby ye may dismay the enemy of Allah and your enemy, and others beside them whom ye know not. Allah knoweth them. Whatsoever ye spend in the way of Allah it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not be wronged. And if they incline to peace, incline thou also to it, and trust in Allah. Lo! He, even He, is the Hearer, the Knower.\n\nSurat An-Nisa (\"The Women\") 4:56–57\n\nLo! Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire. As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment. Lo! Allah is ever Mighty, Wise.\nAnd as for those who believe and do good works, We shall make them enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow - to dwell therein for ever; there for them are pure companions—and We shall make them enter plenteous shade.\n\nSurat Muhammad (\"Muhammad\") 47:4\n\nNow when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.\n\nSurat An-Nisa (\"The Women\") 4:89–90\n\nThey long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve, that ye may be upon a level (with them). So choose not friends from them till they forsake their homes in the way of Allah; if they turn back (to enmity) then take them and kill them wherever ye find them, and choose no friend nor helper from among them,\nExcept those who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a covenant, or (those who) come unto you because their hearts forbid them to make war on you or make war on their own folk. Had Allah willed He could have given them power over you so that assuredly they would have fought you. So, if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace, Allah alloweth you no way against them.\n\nSurat Al-Anfal (\"The Spoils of War\") 8:38–39\n\nTell those who disbelieve that if they cease (from persecution of believers) that which is past will be forgiven them; but if they return (thereto) then the example of the men of old hath already gone (before them, for a warning).\nAnd fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is all for Allah. But if they cease, then lo! Allah is Seer of what they do\n\nThe first edition used copyrighted Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons without permission. These were removed from the second edition.\n\nAlso in the first edition of the film, and removed from the second edition, when referring to the murder of Theo van Gogh a picture of the Dutch rapper Salah Edin is displayed instead of the murderer Mohammed Bouyeri. The picture was shot for the rapper's album 'Nederlands Grootste Nachtmerrie' (Netherlands' Worst Nightmare), which according to the singer's website, was shot to be 'exactly like the mugshot of convicted killer Mohamed B'. A 2007 article by Dutch newspaper De Dag had captioned an article about the killer with the shot. On that occasion, Salah Edin's received an out-of-court libel settlement for the publication. The photo was said by the rapper to be intended to depict \"the way the average white Dutch citizen sees me, as a young Moroccan Muslim radical. That's why I chose to do this picture and use it for the front cover of my album. It is in no way supporting the deeds of Mohamed B.\" Edin has accepted a settlement of €25,000 for copyright infringement.\n\nInternational reaction to \"Fitna\" consisted of condemnation in the Muslim community, fatwās by Al-Qaeda and an Australian imam calling for the beheading of Geert Wilders, and \"attempts\" by Southeast Asian countries to censor the film. The Dutch government allegedly \"distanced itself from the film\". Several Muslim organizations and political parties have organized boycotts against Dutch products.\n\nIndonesia, the most populous Muslim country and itself a Dutch colony until 1949, has conducted a ban on several web sites, such as YouTube, MySpace, Rapidshare and Metacafe, as directed by the Ministry of Communications and Informations. On April 11, the Indonesian government lifted the ban. Indonesian communications minister Muhammad Nuh apologised to the public for the inconvenience. Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia spokesperson, Ismail Yusanto said to Nikolas van Dam, the Dutch ambassador for Indonesia that the Dutch government is responsible for the actions of Geert Wilders Fitna (film) and said aslim taslam.\n\nGeert Wilders' film failed to generate much \"controversy\" in Iran although the government did express its outrage on the day of its release and conservative websites complained about it for a while. By and large, \"Fitna\" elicited indifference among the general public. There was an anti-Fitna demonstration, but just 30 people turned up and they were carrying signs that had \"nothing to do with the film\".\n\nIn response to the film, Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs Maxime Verhagen published an op-ed in the Arabic-language newspaper \"Asharq al Awsat\" on March 30. In the article, he asks of the readers to \"keep the head cool and the relations warm\" and urged dialogue, not provocation, as a means to bridge the cultural differences.\n\nOn 1 April, a debate was held about the film in the Dutch parliament. In this debate, the government and Geert Wilders accused each other of lying about facts of their previous communication. According to various members of the government, Wilders had told in previous conversations about his intentions to tear parts out of the Qur'an and setting them on fire. Wilders denied this.\n\nOne of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons was included in the film without the permission of the artist, Kurt Westergaard. Westergaard has asserted that this infringes his copyright and is considering taking legal action against Wilders. The Danish Union of Journalists has said it will file a lawsuit on Westergaard's behalf. Similarly Dutch director announced to file a lawsuit because of the uncredited use of his interview with Theo van Gogh.\n\nIn 2010 and 2011 Wilders was accused of criminally insulting religious and ethnic groups and inciting hatred and discrimination however he was found not guilty in June 2011.\n\nOn 12 February 2009, Wilders was denied entry to the United Kingdom after being invited by the Lord Pearson of the United Kingdom Independence Party to show his film in the House of Lords. He has declared this \"a sad day for the United Kingdom\" and accused the government of cowardice. Wilders appealed the ban, and on 13 October 2009, it was overturned by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. The UK Home Office then stated its intention not to appeal the tribunal decision; and Wilders' planned visit to the UK went ahead, with his arriving in the country on 16 October 2009. Wilders described the decision to overturn the ban as a \"victory for freedom of speech\".\n\nOn 28 March, a film was released by the Arab European League, named Al Mouftinoun. There was also a call to submit a response film to a special Geert Wilders Film festival. The film Ashkar was declared the winner on 3 May 2008. A Saudi blogger made a contra-film in April called \"Schism\". It was also released on LiveLeak.\n\nWilders has stated that he plans to release a sequel to \"Fitna\". In March 2010 Wilders announced that he plans to release a second movie about the spread of Islam, but not until after Dutch elections in June. He said the sequel to his 2008 film would focus on the consequences of mass migration from Muslim countries, freedom of expression, and \"Sharia\" or Muslim law. He indicated that he received help from professionals in the US to make his film.\nOn 2017 on Twitter Wilders announced he is making a sequel.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21405210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21405210", "title": "Great Depression in India", "text": "Great Depression in India\n\nThe Great Depression of 1929 had a very severe impact on India, which was then under the rule of the British Raj. How much India was affected has been hotly debated. Nationalist historians have argued that the Great Depression slowed long-term industrial development. Outside scholars argue that depression had only a small impact in India's modern secondary sector: in terms of output, there was no depression in India between 1929 and 1934. However there were negative impacts on the jute industry, as world demand fell and prices plunged. Local markets in agriculture and small-scale industry showed modest gains. The Government of British India adopted a protective trade policy which, though beneficial to the United Kingdom, caused great damage to the Indian economy. During the period 1929–1937, exports and imports fell drastically crippling seaborne international trade. The railways and the agricultural sector were the most affected.\n\nThe international financial crisis combined with detrimental policies adopted by the Government of India resulted in soaring prices of commodities. High prices along with the stringent taxes prevalent in British India had a dreadful impact on most Indians. The discontent of farmers manifested itself in rebellions and riots. The Salt Satyagraha of 1930 was one of the measures undertaken as a response to heavy taxation during the Great Depression.\n\nThe Great Depression and the economic policies of the Government of British India worsened already deteriorating Indo-British relations. When the first general elections were held according to the Government of India Act 1935, anti-British feelings resulted in the pro-independence Indian National Congress winning in most provinces with a very high percentage of the vote share.\n\nIndian economy had been largely agricultural before and during the rule of the British. However, during British rule, there was a major shift from the growth of food grains to the cultivation of cash crops. This change was fostered by India's British rulers in order to provide for the textile mills in England, the most important of them being the cotton mills of Manchester and Lancashire which were fed with raw cotton produced in India. Since 1858, committees were established to investigate the possibility of cotton cultivation in India to provide raw materials for the mills in Lancashire. New technologies and industries were also introduced in India, albeit on a very small scale compared to developed nations of the world.\n\nImport duties on British goods were reduced following the 1879 famine. In 1882, apart from those on salt and liquor, all other import duties were abolished. Duties on cotton were revived in 1894 only to be removed once again in 1896.\n\nThe United Kingdom adopted the gold standard in the 1790s. Gold was used to determine the value of the pound sterling throughout the 19th century and the first quarter of the 20th century. The value of the pound sterling depended on the amount of pound sterling needed to purchase a fixed quantity of gold. At the onset of the First World War, the cost of gold was very low and therefore the pound sterling had high value. But during the First World War, the value of the pound fell alarmingly due to rising war expenses (by prompting the government to print more money). At the conclusion of the war, the value of the pound was only a fraction of what it used to be prior to the commencement of the war. It remained low until 1925, when the then Chancellor of the Exchequer ( Finance Minister) of United Kingdom, Winston Churchill, restored it to pre-War levels. As a result, the price of gold fell rapidly. While the rest of Europe purchased large quantities of gold from the United Kingdom, there was little increase in the financial reserves. This dealt a blow to an already deteriorating economy. The United Kingdom began to look to its possessions as India to compensate for the gold that was sold.\n\nIndia was one of the foremost suppliers of raw materials during the First World War. India provided large quantities of iron, steel and other material for the manufacture of arms and armaments. Manufacturing units were gradually established and for the first time, the British Raj adopted a policy of industrialization. India acted both as a supplier as well as a sprawling market for finished British goods in order to sustain Britain's wartime economy.\n\nWhen the war came to an end, the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms were enacted in order to provide certain concessions to Indians in return for their loyalty to the Empire during the war. In 1923, the British Raj offered government protection to nine industries posing them as a sincere bid to industrialize the economy. However, the measures appeared symbolic and were intended to finance and protect British enterprise as was evident from the fact that all the benefactors were British-run industries. At the onset of the Great Depression, as it had been always, much of India's imports were from the United Kingdom. On the eve of the First World War, India was the British Empire's single largest market with its exports to India at Rs. 730 million making up over one-sixth of the country's total exports.\n\nDuring the annual fiscal year 1928–29, the total revenue for the Government of India was Rs. 1,548 million. The total exports were valued at Rs. 3,390 million while imports were valued at Rs. 2,630 million.\n\nIndia suffered badly due to the Great Depression. The price decline from late 1929 to October 1931 was 36 percent compared to 27 percent in the United Kingdom and 26 percent in the United States.\n\nDuring the Depression, the British Raj intensified the existing imperialistic economic policies. While these policies protected Britain's economy, they destroyed India's. Because the fall in prices had been higher in India compared to the rest of the world, the price of commodities manufactured in India rose dramatically compared to imports from the United Kingdom or some other country in the world. Farmers who were cultivating food crops had earlier moved over to cash crop cultivation in large numbers to meet the demands of the mills in the United Kingdom. Now, they were crippled as they were unable to sell their products in India due to the high prices; nor could they export the commodities to the United Kingdom which had recently adopted a protective policy prohibiting imports from India. Angus Maddison's historical dataset shows Indian GDP actually rose around 1% from 1929-32, a much better outcome than for most other economies.\n\nRice, wheat, etc., could be used for private consumption but the cash crops which they now cultivated could not be used for private consumption. As there was little sale of indigenous manufactures and limited exports, commodities accumulated and the flow of cash was restricted. Moreover, imports were severely affected by the Swadeshi movement and the boycott of foreign goods imposed by Indian Freedom Fighters. There was a deficiency of money in many places causing widespread poverty.\n\nIn such a condition, the most recommended course of action is the devaluation of currency. Most countries afflicted by the Great Depression as Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and Denmark reduced the exchange value of their currencies. However, the British Raj rejected the idea. A recommended course of action to increase mobility of cash is rise of government expenditure. However, the Government was less interested in spending than accumulation.\n\nInternational trade decreased a great deal. The imports fell by over 47% while the exports fell by over 49% between 1929 and 1932. Between 1928–29 and 1933–34, exports due to seaborne trade decreased by 55.75% to Rs. 1.25 billion while imports decreased by 55.51% to Rs. 2.02 billion.\n\nDue to a decline in exports and imports, and thereby, in the transportation of goods, the railway revenues decreased exponentially. All the expenses for the years 1930–31 and 1931–32 were paid from the Railway Reserve Fund. There was a decrease of Rs. 151 million in the railway revenues between 1930 and 1932.\n\nIn British India, apart from existing imports and exports, there was also a particular amount of money which colonial India contributed towards administration, maintenance of the army, war expenses, pensions to retired officers and other expenses accrued by Britain towards maintenance of her colony. These were known as \"Home charges\" and were paid for almost entirely by India.\n\nThe Home charges was made of five components\n\n\nDue to the drastic collapse of international trade and the very little revenue obtained for it, India could only pay off her home charges by selling off her gold reserves. From 1931–32 to 1934–35, India exported ₹ 2,330 million worth of gold.\n\nThe Great Depression had a terrible impact on Indian farmers. While there was a steady, uninhibited increase in land rent, the value of the agricultural produce had come down to alarming levels. Therefore, having incurred heavy losses, farmers were compelled to sell off gold and silver ornaments in their possession in order to pay the land rent and other taxes.\n\nBy 1931, around 1600 ounces of gold were arriving every day at the port of Bombay. This gold intake was transported to the United Kingdom to compensate for the low bullion prices in the country and thereby revitalize the British economy. United Kingdom was overjoyed as its economy recovered with gold and silver from India.\n\nThe Viceroy, Lord Willingdon remarked\n\nThe policies of the Government of India during the Great Depression resulted in widespread protests all over the country. As the national struggle intensified, the Government of India conceded some of the economic demands of the nationalists, including the establishment of a central bank. Accordingly, the Reserve Bank of India Act was passed in 1934 and a central bank came into being on April 1, 1935 with Sir Osborne Smith as its first Governor. However, when Osborne Smith tried to function independently and indulged in open confrontation with P. J. Grigg, the finance member of the Viceroy's Council, he was removed from office.\n\nOn December 31, 1929, at a session of the Indian National Congress held on the banks of the river Ravi in Lahore, Jawaharlal Nehru unfurled the tricolor and declared that complete independence from British rule would, henceforth, be the goal of the Congress. This was a remarkable shift of policy for the Indian National Congress as it had, till now, been a staunch advocate of dominion status. This declaration also triggered the Civil Disobedience Movement, which commenced with the Salt Satyagraha.\n\nThe Salt Satyagraha formed the highpoint of the Civil Disobedience Movement. While the heavy salt tax was always a burden to the poor peasant, the widespread poverty during the Great Depression made it even more difficult for the commoner to procure salt. In response to this tax, between March 12, 1930 and April 5, 1930, Mahatma Gandhi marched with over 30,000 followers to the coastal town of Dandi in Gujarat, where they illegally manufactured salt and defied the Government monopoly on salt. Subsequently, similar satyagrahas were organized at Dharasana and Vedaranyam. The Government responded with a massive roundup, but by then, the march and the media coverage had radically moulded international opinion.\n\n\n"}

The criteria for distinguishing between a \"hard\" and \"soft\" landing are numerous and subjective.\n\nIn the United States, modern recessions and hard and soft landings follow from Federal Reserve tightening cycles, in which the Federal funds rate is increased over several consecutive moves.\n"}

It began its operation on 30 September 2010 with the appointment of the members of the fund's Board of Directors.\n\nThe fund has been seeded by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) with 50 billion euros to recapitalize Greece's banks.\n\nOriginally governed by a Board of Directors, on 30 January 2013, the fund's management was reorganized into a two-tier management structure, consisting of the General Council and the Executive Board. While Anastasia Sakellariou was appointed Managing Director, or CEO, as part of the Executive Board, Paul Koster became Chairman of the General Council. Koster however resigned on 15 March 2013 and was replaced by Christos Sclavounis.\n\nFollowing the January 2015 legislative election, the new SYRIZA government was expected to replace Sclavounis by Panagiotis Roumeliotis, while Sakellariou would remain Managing Director. Shortly thereafter, Sclavounis indeed resigned from his office as Chairman.\n\nSakellariou (Chief Executive Director of the HFSF between 2013 and 2015) had to be asked by the Greek government to step down from its position in May of 2015 as she was charged, alongside other 25 former executives of the Hellenic Post Bank, with committing fraud and money laundering.\n\nDuring the first year and half after its creation, the HFSF had capital for €1.5 billion. During this time the only bank receiving funds from it was New Proton.\n\nIn spring 2013, the HFSF together with the Bank of Greece led the merger of ten Greek banks into four \"systemic\" banks.\n\nBy early 2015, the HFSF kept a remaining buffer of 11 billion euros in EFSF bonds that the outgoing Greek government had intended to repurpose as a precautionary credit line. In February 2015, the new, SYRIZA-led administration negotiated with the Troika over a six-month extension of the Master Financial Assistance Facility Agreement. The administration proposed repurposing the remaining funds for Keynesian anti-cyclical investments in the non-banking economic sector.

{"id": "48219615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48219615", "title": "I Took a Pill in Ibiza", "text": "I Took a Pill in Ibiza\n\n\"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" (also known by its censored title \"In Ibiza\" or its clean title \"I Took a Plane to Ibiza\") is a song by American singer Mike Posner. The song, originally acoustic guitar-based, was remixed by the Norwegian duo Seeb and released digitally as a single in the United States on July 24, 2015. The original version is on Posner's second EP \"The Truth\", while both versions are on his second studio album \"At Night, Alone\".\n\nThe Seeb remix reached the top ten of the charts in twenty seven countries, including number one in Belgium, Ireland, Israel, Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. In the UK, the song remained at the top of the charts for four weeks. It has achieved high chart positions in Posner's native United States, where it reached number one on both the \"Billboard\" Dance/Mix Show Airplay Chart and the \"Billboard\" Pop Songs chart, also peaking at number four on the main chart \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for two weeks. The song became Posner's biggest single, outperforming his debut, \"Cooler than Me\" (2010), and was later nominated for a Grammy Award for Song of the Year.\n\nRegarding their remix, Seeb told Official Charts: \"We got it from Matt D'Arduini, VP A&R at Island Records. It was really slow and we only listened to the vocals on it. Matt sent us the multitrack of Mike's new EP and we picked \"Ibiza\" right away. Such a brilliant lyric and melody but it needed a new soundscape to be a hit.\" Posner has called the success of the remix version both \"ironic\" and \"beautiful\": \"I wrote this sad thing, and it was me processing some dark and heavy emotion, and now people seem to be having their own joyous memories out of my sadness. That’s a very beautiful thing as an artist.\"\n\nThe original version of \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" by Posner is a folk pop song, and is written in the key of B major, while Seeb's remix is a tropical house song, and is written in the key of G minor in half time with a tempo of 102 beats per minute. It follows a chord progression of Gm – F – E – B, and Posner's vocals span from B to D.\n\n\"Billboard\" ranked \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza\" #30 on its \"100 Best Pop Songs of 2016: Critics' Picks\" list, writing, \"The weirdness of 2016 might be best encapsulated by Mike Posner earning his first Hot 100 top 10 in nearly six years—and ending the year with a Grammy nomination for Song of the Year—for a song lamenting his status as 'a singer who already blew his shot.' That's due in part to the power of Seeb's buoyant, tropical house-flavored remix, but the cautionary tale of post-fame and excess drives it home, even as it ironically became Posner’s biggest hit yet.\"\n\n\"Time\" was more negative toward the remix, stating, \"Originally conceived as a folksy pop song in the vein of Jason Mraz, there was something clever about Posner's withering takedown of drug-taking EDM bro culture. But the much more popular Seeb remix sapped it of its wit, turning it into the exact thing it was satirizing. What a comedown.\"\n\nMike Posner performs the song live in the style of Seeb's remix, but with a live band and adding the third verse on vocals and guitar only. He has performed the song on a number of talk shows including \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" and \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\". In his rendition on the talk show \"Conan\", he brought in a 10-piece string orchestra and 4 backing vocalists, and he introduced a new intro and final verse to the song, the latter of which talked about Posner's father having cancer. He also performed an acoustic version on \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show\" at the Elvis Duran Performing Arts Center.\n\nArtist Tom Odell performed a cover of the song on the BBC Live Lounge, which received very good feedback from fans and critics.\n\nIn April 2016, it was reported that tourism officials in Ibiza (Spain) were \"annoyed\" by the song as they felt it contributed to Ibiza's reputation for drug-related debauchery due to lyrics in the song such as \"I took a pill in Ibiza\" and \"You don't want to be high like me\". The island's tourism director, Vicent Ferrer, stated, \"We have invited the author of this song to discover Ibiza because we have much more to offer besides the nightlife which is known worldwide,\" and noted that the island had been \"typecast\" due to its reputation for nightlife and as a partying destination.\n\nA music video featuring the Seeb remix was launched via Posner's YouTube Vevo account on February 26, 2016. It portrays Posner as a druggie whose face is replaced by a papier-mâchéd mask. The man spends the video becoming increasingly intoxicated as he mingles with girls and his equally self-destructive friends. The man sings about how his fame, having long since faded, left him completely empty inside and unable to feel any kind of fulfillment, causing him to attempt to fill the void with his rampant hedonism and material possessions. As of October 2018, this music video has received over 1.0 billion views on YouTube.\n\nA second music video featuring the original version was released on March 15, 2016. It features Posner with sheets of paper depicting lyrics of the song in a style similar to Bob Dylan's 1965 electric folk song, \"Subterranean Homesick Blues\".\n\nThe song is featured in the television shows \"Scream,\" \"Superstore\" and \"Riverdale\". It was also played during the swimsuit competition of \"Miss Universe 2016\".\n\n"}
{"id": "16857000", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16857000", "title": "Jeremiah Wright controversy", "text": "Jeremiah Wright controversy\n\nThe Jeremiah Wright controversy gained national attention in the United States, in March 2008 when ABC News, after reviewing dozens of U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama's pastor Jeremiah Wright's sermons, excerpted parts of his sermons about terrorist attacks on the United States and government dishonesty, which were subject to intense media scrutiny. Wright is a retired senior pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago and former pastor of Obama.\n\nObama denounced the statements in question, but critics continued to press the issue of his relationship with Wright. In response to this, he gave a speech titled \"A More Perfect Union\", in which he sought to place Wright's comments in a historical and sociological context. In the speech, Obama again denounced Wright's remarks, but did not disown him as a person. The controversy began to fade, but was renewed in late April when Wright made a series of media appearances, including an interview on \"Bill Moyers Journal\", a speech at the NAACP, and a speech at the National Press Club. After the last of these, Obama spoke more forcefully against his former pastor, saying that he was \"outraged\" and \"saddened\" by his behavior, and in May he resigned his membership in the church.\n\nBarack Obama first met Wright in the late 1980s, while he was working as a community organizer in Chicago before attending Harvard Law School. Wright officiated at the wedding ceremony of Barack and Michelle Obama, as well as at their children's baptisms.\n\nThe title of Obama's 2006 memoir, \"The Audacity of Hope\", was inspired by one of Wright's sermons. This sermon also was the source for themes of Obama's 2004 keynote address to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nAs reported in \"The New York Times\", Wright was scheduled to give the public invocation before Obama's presidential announcement, but Obama withdrew the invitation the night before the event. Wright criticized the \"Times\" for their characterization of the incident as a distortion of the interview he had granted, where he had spoken of Obama in an extremely positive light.\n\nIn 2007, Wright was appointed to Barack Obama's African American Religious Leadership Committee, a group of over 170 national black religious leaders who supported Obama's bid for the Democratic nomination. However, it was announced in March 2008 that Wright was no longer serving as a member of this group.\n\nOn May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ, stating that \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views\".\n\nMost of the controversial excerpts that gained national attention in March 2008 were taken from two sermons: one titled \"The Day of Jerusalem's Fall\", delivered on September 16, 2001, and another titled \"Confusing God and Government\", delivered on April 13, 2003.\n\nIn a sermon delivered shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001, Wright made comments about an interview of former U.S. Ambassador Edward Peck he saw on Fox News. Wright said:\n\nWright spoke of the United States taking land from the Indian tribes by what he labeled as terror, bombing Grenada, Panama, Libya, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki, and argued that the United States supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and South Africa. He said that his parishioners' response should be to examine their relationship with God, not go \"from the hatred of armed enemies to the hatred of unarmed innocents.\" His comment (quoting Malcolm X) that \"America's chickens are coming home to roost\" was widely interpreted as meaning that America had brought the September 11 attacks upon itself. ABC News broadcast clips from the sermon in which Wright said:\n\nLater, Wright continued :\n\nClips from a sermon that Wright gave, entitled \"Confusing God and Government\", were also shown on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and on Fox News. In the sermon, Wright first makes the distinction between God and governments, and points out that many governments in the past have failed: \"Where governments lie, God does not lie. Where governments change, God does not change.\" Wright then states:\n\n[The United States] government lied about their belief that all men were created equal. The truth is they believed that all white men were created equal. The truth is they did not even believe that white women were created equal, in creation nor civilization. The government had to pass an amendment to the Constitution to get white women the vote. Then the government had to pass an equal rights amendment to get equal protection under the law for women. The government still thinks a woman has no rights over her own body, and between Uncle Clarence who sexually harassed Anita Hill, and a closeted Klan court, that is a throwback to the 19th century, handpicked by Daddy Bush, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, between Clarence and that stacked court, they are about to undo \"Roe vs. Wade\", just like they are about to un-do affirmative action. The government lied in its founding documents and the government is still lying today. Governments lie.\n\nHe continued:\n\nThe government lied about Pearl Harbor too. They knew the Japanese were going to attack. Governments lie. The government lied about the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. They wanted that resolution to get us in the Vietnam War. Governments lie. The government lied about Nelson Mandela and our CIA helped put him in prison and keep him there for 27 years. The South African government lied on Nelson Mandela. Governments lie.\n\nWright then stated:\n\nThe government lied about the Tuskegee experiment. They purposely infected African American men with syphilis. Governments lie. The government lied about bombing Cambodia and Richard Nixon stood in front of the camera, \"Let me make myself perfectly clear ...\" Governments lie. The government lied about the drugs for arms Contra scheme orchestrated by Oliver North, and then the government pardoned all the perpetrators so they could get better jobs in the government. Governments lie. ... The government lied about inventing the HIV virus as a means of genocide against people of color. Governments lie. The government lied about a connection between Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein and a connection between 9.11.01 and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Governments lie.\n\nHe spoke about the government's rationale for the Iraq War:\n\nThe government lied about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq being a threat to the United States peace. And guess what else? If they don't find them some weapons of mass destruction, they gonna do just like the LAPD, and plant them some weapons of mass destruction. Governments lie.\n\nWright then commented on God and government:\n\nAnd the United States of America government, when it came to treating her citizens of Indian descent fairly, she failed. She put them on reservations. When it came to treating her citizens of Japanese descent fairly, she failed. She put them in internment prison camps. When it came to treating her citizens of African descent fairly, America failed. She put them in chains, the government put them on slave quarters, put them on auction blocks, put them in cotton field, put them in inferior schools, put them in substandard housing, put them in scientific experiments, put them in the lowest paying jobs, put them outside the equal protection of the law, kept them out of their racist bastions of higher education and locked them into positions of hopelessness and helplessness. The government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three-strike law and then wants us to sing \"God Bless America\". No, no, no, not God Bless America. God damn America — that's in the Bible — for killing innocent people. God damn America, for treating our citizens as less than human. God damn America, as long as she tries to act like she is God, and she is supreme. The United States government has failed the vast majority of her citizens of African descent.\n\nThese sermon excerpts were widely viewed in early 2008 on network television and the internet.\n\nWhen Wright's comments were aired in the national media, Obama distanced himself from them, saying to Charles Gibson of ABC News, \"It's as if we took the five dumbest things that I've ever said or you've ever said in our lives and compressed them and put them out there — I think that people's reaction would, understandably, be upset.\" At the same time, Obama stated that \"words that degrade individuals have no place in our public dialogue, whether it's on the campaign stump or in the pulpit. In sum, I reject outright the statements by Rev. Wright that are at issue.\" Obama later added, \"Had the reverend not retired, and had he not acknowledged that what he had said had deeply offended people and were inappropriate and mischaracterized what I believe is the greatness of this country, for all its flaws, then I wouldn't have felt as comfortable staying at the church.\"\n\nObama stated that he was aware of Wright's controversial comments and had personally heard \"remarks that could be considered controversial\" in Wright's church, but denied having heard the particular inflammatory statements that were widely televised during the campaign. Obama was specifically asked by Bill O'Reilly if Wright had said white people were bad, to which Obama replied that he hadn't. In his book \"Dreams from my Father\", Obama had quoted Wright as saying in a sermon \"It's this world, where cruise ships throw away more food in a day than most residents of Port-au-Prince see in a year, where White folks' greed runs a world in need.\" Obama said that the remarks had come to his attention at the beginning of his presidential campaign, but contended that because Wright was on the verge of retirement, and because of Obama's strong links to Trinity, he had not thought it appropriate to leave the church. He began distancing himself from Wright when he called his pastor the night before the February 2007 announcement of Obama's presidential candidacy to withdraw his request that Wright deliver an invocation at the event. A spokesperson later said, \"Senator Obama is proud of his pastor and his church, but ... decided to avoid having statements and beliefs being used out of context and forcing the entire church to defend itself.\" Wright attended the announcement, prayed with Obama beforehand, and in December 2007 Obama named him to the African American Religious Leadership Committee of his campaign. The Obama campaign released Wright after the controversy.\n\nObama's critics found this response inadequate. For example, Mark Steyn, writing in the conservative publication \"National Review\", stated: \"Reverend Wright['s] appeals to racial bitterness are supposed to be everything President Obama will transcend. Right now, it sounds more like the same-old same-old.\"\n\nOn March 18, in the wake of the controversy, Obama delivered a speech entitled \"A More Perfect Union\" at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. During the course of the 37-minute speech, Obama spoke of the divisions formed through generations through slavery, segregation, and Jim Crow laws, and the reasons for the kinds of discussions and rhetoric used among blacks and whites in their own communities. While condemning the remarks by the pastor, he sought to place them in historical context by describing some of the key events that have formed Wright's views on race-related matters in America. Obama did not disown Wright, whom he has labeled as \"an old uncle\", as akin to disowning the black community. The speech was generally well received. Obama said that some of the comments by his pastor reminded him of what he called America's \"tragic history when it comes to race.\"\n\nIn an interview with the editorial board of the \"Pittsburgh Tribune-Review\" on March 25, 2008, Hillary Clinton commented on Obama's attendance at Trinity United Church of Christ, stating, \"You don't choose your family, but you choose what church you want to attend.\" Later the same day, during a press conference, Clinton spoke on her personal preference in a pastor: \"I think given all we have heard and seen, [Wright] would not have been my pastor.\" A spokesperson for the Obama campaign asserted that Clinton's comments were part of a \"transparent effort to distract attention away from the story she made up about dodging sniper fire in Bosnia\" the prior week. Weeks later during the Pennsylvania debate in Philadelphia, Clinton said, \"For Pastor Wright to have given his first sermon after 9/11 and to have blamed the United States for the attack, which happened in my city of New York, would have been just intolerable for me.\"\n\nFuture Republican nominee John McCain defended Obama when it came to allegations of guilt by association, saying, \"I think that when people support you, it doesn't mean that you support everything they say. Obviously, those words and those statements are statements that none of us would associate ourselves with, and I don't believe that Senator Obama would support any of those, as well.\"\n\nVice President Dick Cheney weighed in on the Wright matter on April 10, 2008. He appeared on Sean Hannity's radio show and said, \"I thought some of the things he said were absolutely appalling ... I haven't gotten into the business of trying to judge how Sen. Obama dealt with it, or didn't deal with it, but I think, like most Americans, I was stunned at what the reverend was preaching in his church and then putting up on his Web site.\"\n\nLawrence Korb—Director of National Security Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, and former assistant Secretary of Defense in the administration of Ronald Reagan—defended Wright's military service, stating, \"We've seen on television, in a seemingly endless loop, sound bites of a select few of Rev. Wright's many sermons. Some of the Wright's comments are inexcusable and inappropriate and should be condemned, but in calling him 'unpatriotic,' let us not forget that this is a man who gave up six of the most productive years of his life to serve his country ... he has demonstrated his patriotism.\"\n\nConservative radio talk show and television host Sean Hannity expressed shock and anger when hearing the comments, saying, \"First of all, I will not let up on this issue. If his pastor went to Libya, Tripoli with Louis Farrakhan, a virulent, anti-Semitic racist, his church gave a lifetime achievement award to Louis Farrakhan. That's been Barack Obama's pastor for 20 years. And we will continue to expose this until somebody in the mainstream media has the courage to take this on.\"\n\n\"Salon\" editor-in-chief Joan Walsh wrote: \"the whole idea that Wright has been attacked over 'sound bites,' and if Americans saw his entire sermons, in context, they'd feel differently, now seems ludicrous. The long clips Moyers played only confirm what was broadcast in the snippets\". She went on to note: \"My conclusion Friday night was bolstered by new tapes of Wright that came out this weekend, including one that captures him saying the Iraq war is 'the same thing al-Qaida is doing under a different color flag,' and a much longer excerpt from the 'God damn America' sermon that denounces 'Condoskeezer Rice ... .\n\nFox News' Bill O'Reilly said of Wright, \"In my opinion, Rev. Jeremiah Wright is not an honest man. He preaches anti-white and anti-American rhetoric, all the while making money off it.\"\n\nCultural critic Kelefa Sanneh traced Wright's theology and rhetoric back to Frederick Douglass, analyzing his 1854 reference to antebellum US Christians as \"bad, corrupt, and wicked\".\n\nNoting that \"many observers argue that Wright's sermons convey a more complex message than simple sound bites can express\", the \"Chicago Tribune\" published lengthy excerpts in the article \"Rev. Jeremiah Wright's words: Sound bite vs. sermon excerpt\".\n\nEconomist and social commentator Thomas Sowell wrote that there was \"no way that [Obama] didn't know about Jeremiah Wright's anti-American and racist diatribes from the pulpit.\" He wrote that Obama was \"no ordinary member\" of the church, having once donated $20,000 to it, and that Obama's speech was \"like the Soviet show trials during their 1930s purges\", intended only to convince supporters.\n\nThe controversy sparked continuous media coverage, on both national media outlets and local sources. More than 3,000 news stories had been written on the issue by early April.\n\nWright's church, Trinity United Church of Christ, criticized the media coverage of his past sermons, saying in a statement that Wright's \"character is being assassinated in the public sphere. ... It is an indictment on Dr. Wright's ministerial legacy to present his global ministry within a 15- or 30-second sound bite.\"\n\nLara Cohen, news director at the \"Us Weekly\", noted that her publication \"has been accused of distracting people from the 'Important Issues because of its focus on supermarket tabloid concerns, and said that mainstream media \"talking heads love to tut-tut about how attention to celebrity gossip is causing the great dumbing down of American society.\" She charged that, in light of the sensationalized coverage about Wright, mainstream media outlets no longer had grounds to make these criticisms of \"Us Weekly\", and turned the charge back upon the mainstream media. Cohen stated, \"The true hallmark of sensationalized journalism is ginning up controversy to drive sales, and for the mainstream news media Wright was a tailor-made tabloid icon. With newspaper sales at record lows, network news ratings tanking and 24-hour news channels desperate to fill up all 24 hours, Wright's outbursts were the mainstream media's equivalent of Tom Cruise jumping on Oprah's couch—a train wreck no one could turn away from. And so they milked it, regardless of the impact on the very race they were supposedly covering objectively.\"\n\nRepublican commentator and former National Security Council staff member Lt. Col. Oliver North (whom Wright mentioned in his controversial comments) said of the controversy's media coverage, \"Rather than serving up more blather about Jeremiah Wright, editors, producers and program directors would better serve us all by sending their commentators and correspondents out to cover those who have volunteered to serve in our military.\"\n\nStephen Colbert satirized what he portrayed as the media's obsession with the Wright story. Jon Stewart similarly made fun of the media's obsession with Wright, calling it their \"Festival of Wrights\" and the \"Reverending Story\".\n\nInvestigative journalist Robert Parry contrasted the mainstream media's attention to Wright with its almost total silence on the topic of South Korean religious leader Sun Myung Moon and his relationship with the Republican Party and especially the Bush family.\n\nOn July 20, 2010, the conservative news and opinion website \"The Daily Caller\" reported that a group of reporters and columnists for major periodicals who were a part of the JournoList LISTSERV had secretly worked together to devise a strategy to minimize the damage to the Barack Obama campaign by depicting as racists those political or media figures who attempted to make Wright an issue in the campaign. This was explicitly discussed as a strategy to keep the right from maintaining control of the country.\n\nLisa Miller in \"Newsweek\" reported that, before the political controversy erupted, \"Trinity was already in the throes of a difficult generational transition.\" After the period of Wright's speaking engagements before national audiences, Miller describes how \"the reaction was anguish and anger\" among church members and that three basic factions developed among them: those who wished Wright would not speak anymore, those who believed in what he said, and those who just wished the whole controversy would go away.\n\nMany academics commented on Wright, black theology, and the concomitant political controversy within a broader context of American history and culture.\n\nIn 2004, prior to the Wright controversy, Anthony E. Cook, a professor of law at Georgetown University, provided a detailed comparative analysis of sermons delivered after 9-11 by Jerry Falwell, T.D. Jakes, and Jeremiah Wright. Cook argued that the overall intent of Falwell's and Jakes's sermons was to use the Christian religion as a justification for the War on Terror, while Wright's overall intent was to side against war and to get listeners to engage in introspection about their daily behavior and relationship with God.\n\nAfter the political controversy erupted, Georgetown University sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson stated, \"Patriotism is the affirmation of one's country in light of its best values, including the attempt to correct it when it's in error. Wright's words are the tough love of a war-tested patriot speaking his mind.\" J. Kameron Carter, associate professor of theology and black church studies at Duke Divinity School, stated that Wright \"voiced in his sermons a pain that must be interpreted inside of the tradition of black prophetic Christianity.\"\n\nMartin E. Marty, an emeritus professor of religious history, criticized reporters' \"naiveté\" about the civil rights movement. He placed Wright's comments in context of his church: \"For Trinity, being 'unashamedly black' does not mean being 'anti-white. He also argued that black shame was a debilitating legacy of slavery and segregation in society and church, and argued that Trinity's Africentrism \"should not be more offensive than that synagogues should be 'Judeo-centric' or that Chicago's Irish parishes be 'Celtic-centric'.\"\n\nBill J. Leonard—Dean of the divinity school and professor of church history at Wake Forest University—argued that Wright \"was standing and speaking out of the jeremiad tradition of preaching in the U.S.\", which he said \"dates back to the Puritans\"; Leonard stated that this was something that both \"black and white ministers have used since the 17th century in this country.\" Leonard explains that the jeremiad tradition dealt with \"woe and promise and moral failure not only in the church but in the nation.\" James B. Bennett of Santa Clara University said that Martin Luther King, Jr. shared similar feelings with Wright concerning some U.S. activities, quoting King as saying, \"the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today — my own government\", and that \"America was founded on genocide, and a nation that is founded on genocide is destructive.\"\n\nStephan Thernstrom, Winthrop professor of history at Harvard, and Abigail Thernstrom, political scientist and the vice chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, wrote that \"[Wright] contended that blacks and whites had completely different brain structures, one left-dominant, the other right-dominant. This is nothing more than an updated version of the pseudo-science once used to defend segregation in the Jim Crow South\". They also wrote: \"clearly, Rev. Wright does not speak for mainstream black churches — and he has done them a gross disservice by claiming to do so.\" Former Harvard lecturer Martin Peretz concurred, endorsing the article and saying that it \"puts Trinity into its proper place in relation to other black churches and shows how different it is from them.\"\n\nJeremiah Wright publicly discussed the controversy in depth in an hour-long interview with Bill Moyers on April 25, 2008. This included longer clips of his sermons, along with his explanations of what he was saying. There were also clips of his ministry and parishioners at various points in time since he became pastor in 1972, in an attempt to show what Trinity stands for and has accomplished. Wright stated that his comments were \"taken out of context\" and that \"the persons who have heard the entire sermon understand the communication perfectly.\" He went on to say: \"When something is taken like a sound bite for a political purpose and put constantly over and over again, looped in the face of the public, that's not a failure to communicate. Those who are doing that are communicating exactly what they want to do, which is to paint me as some sort of fanatic or as the learned journalist from the \"New York Times\" called me, a 'wackadoodle' ... The message that is being communicated by the soundbites is exactly what those pushing those sound bites \"want\" to communicate.\" Conservative pundits and PBS's ombudsman criticized Moyers for being too gentle on Wright.\n\nOn April 27, Wright gave a keynote address at a fundraising dinner for the Detroit-chapter of the NAACP. In front of nearly 10,000, he discussed the controversy, saying, \"I am not running for the Oval Office\", referring to what he perceived as Republican attempts to make the controversy part of the campaign. Earlier that day, he delivered a sermon to 4,000 at the Friendship-West Baptist Church in Dallas. On April 28, he spoke to the National Press Club, where he discussed the Black church.\n\nIn his speech to the NAACP, Wright speculated that, \"Africans have a different meter, and Africans have a different tonality. Europeans have seven tones, Africans have five. White people clap differently than black people. Africans and African-Americans are right-brained, subject-oriented in their learning style. They have a different way of learning.\" The comments were labeled as racist, and likened to eugenics. This initiated a revival of the controversy, which had been slowly waning.\n\nFormer aide to President Ronald Reagan David Gergen called Wright's speaking tour \"the dumbest, most selfish, most narcissistic thing I've seen in 40 years of covering politics.\" Libertarian commentator Andrew Sullivan said Wright's comments on the tour were a \"calculated, ugly, repulsive, vile display of arrogance, egotism, and self-regard.\" Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich characterized Wright's speaking tour as an attempt to deliberately hurt Obama, and stated that Wright's sense of self-importance appeared to be his motivation. Columnist Bob Herbert of \"The New York Times\" also suggested that Wright was being a \"narcissist\" and trying to \"wreck\" Obama's campaign.\n\nObama attempted to further distance himself from Wright, as he expressed outrage and shock at a press conference on April 29:\n\nI am outraged by the comments that were made and saddened by the spectacle that we saw yesterday ... The person that I saw yesterday was not the person that I met 20 years ago. His comments were not only divisive and destructive, but I believe that they end up giving comfort to those who prey on hate, and I believe that they do not portray accurately the perspective of the black church. They certainly don't portray accurately my values and beliefs. And if Reverend Wright thinks that that's political posturing, as he put it, then he doesn't know me very well. And based on his remarks yesterday, well, I may not know him as well as I thought either. ... What became clear to me is that he was presenting a world view that contradicts who I am and what I stand for, and what I think particularly angered me was his suggestion somehow that my previous denunciation of his remarks were somehow political posturing. Anybody who knows me and anybody who knows what I'm about knows that I am about trying to bridge gaps and I see the commonality in all people. ... [A]fter seeing Reverend Wright's performance, I felt as if there was a complete disregard for what the American people are going through and the need for them to rally together to solve these problems. ... [W]hatever relationship I had with Reverend Wright has changed, as a consequence of this.\n\nObama's second statement on the controversy elicited a range of responses. Noam Scheiber of \"The New Republic\" wrote, \"I thought Obama put the distance he needed to between himself and Wright just now ... The other lingering question is whether people will wonder all over again how Obama could have been friends with this guy for 20 years. It's a legitimate concern, but if it didn't weigh him down too much after the Philadelphia speech in March, I wouldn't expect it to do him in this time. Wright's 'performance' yesterday struck me as new and brazen enough to warrant a different reaction than Obama would have had in the past.\"\n\nVictor Davis Hanson wrote, \"Obama, by what he wrote in his memoirs, by what he said when he spoke in his early campaign speeches, by his frequent praise of Wright, and by his 20-year presence in front of, and subsidies to, Obama knew exactly the racist and anti-American nature of his odious pastor.\" American linguist and social commentator John McWhorter wrote, \"now that the Reverend Wright has gone on tour and given us full doses of these professionally alienated postures from another time, it is good to see that Mr. Obama has had the courage to decisively break with him. Sad, too — the man was his pastor, after all. But here is one more way that Mr. Obama is learning what hardball really is.\"\n\nOn May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ, where Wright had previously served as senior pastor, stating that \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views\".\n\nWright stated in a June 10, 2009 interview that he had still voted for Obama for President, despite the controversy. He said that he had no regrets about any of his comments. He also alleged that \"them Jews\" within the Obama administration are preventing the two from speaking to each other. He also suggested that Obama did not send a delegation to the Durban Review Conference in Geneva because of Jewish pressure, saying: \"[T]he Jewish vote, the A-I-P-A-C vote, that's controlling him, that would not let him send representation to the Darfur Review Conference, that's talking this craziness on this trip, cause they're Zionists, they would not let him talk to someone who calls a spade what it is.\"\n\nThe Anti Defamation League released a statement condemning Wright's remarks as \"inflammatory and false. The notions of Jewish control of the White House in Reverend Wright's statement express classic anti-Semitism in its most vile form.\" Rabbi Scott Gurdin at Temple Sinai said Wright \"is missing an opportunity to build alliances and bridges.\" The National Jewish Democratic Council distributed a statement reading, \"Obama showed good judgment in strongly separating himself from Reverend Jeremiah Wright\".\n\nWright modified his statements the next day, saying that \"I'm not talking about all Jews, all people of the Jewish faith, I'm talking about Zionists.\" He also endorsed the anti-Zionist books \"Judaism Does Not Equal Israel\" by Marc Ellis and \"The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine\" by Ilan Pappe. He commented, \"[e]thnic cleansing the Zionist is a sin and a crime against humanity, and they don't want Barack talking like that\". \"The Atlantic\" writer Jeffrey Goldberg remarked that \"In other words ... [h]e regrets speaking plainly instead of deploying a euphemism.\" On June 11, classical historian and columnist Victor Davis Hanson compared Wright's ongoing criticisms of Obama to that of the Furies of Greek Mythology.\n\nWright wrote on his Facebook page apologizing for his remarks on June 12. He wrote, \"I mis-spoke and I sincerely meant no harm or ill-will to the American Jewish community or the Obama administration ... I have great respect for the Jewish faith and the foundational (and central) part of our Judeo-Christian tradition.\" He also stated, \"I love President Obama as my son, and support and honor him as the President of the United States of America and leader of the free world.\" Amos Brown, a former San Francisco supervisor and Baptist pastor, has defended Wright and disputed charges of antisemitism. He said, \"[p]eople hear snippets of things and they go running with it rather than sitting down and having a dialogue, the way Jesus engaged people\".\n\nIn mid-March, a Rasmussen Reports national telephone poll of voters found that just 8% had a favorable opinion of Jeremiah Wright and 58% had an unfavorable view. 73% of voters believed that Wright's comments were divisive, while 29% of African-Americans said Wright's comments made them more likely to support Obama. 66% of those polled had read, seen, or heard news stories about Wright's comments.\n\nDuring these events, Hillary Clinton briefly took the lead in the Gallup national tracking poll, ahead of Obama by 7 points on March 18. By March 20, Clinton's lead decreased to 2 points, a statistically insignificant amount. The same day, John McCain took a 3-point lead over both Democratic candidates in hypothetical General Election match ups, with a 2-point margin of error. By March 22, Obama had regained his lead over Clinton and was up by 3 points. The editor-in-chief of the Gallup Poll said that the effect of the controversy \"died after a couple of days\".\n\nA CBS poll taken from March 15 to March 17 found that sixty-five percent of registered voters said it made no difference in their view of Obama, while thirty percent said it made them have a less favorable view.\n\nAt the end of March 2008, as over 40 states had already held their Democratic primary processes, Barack Obama built on his national Gallup daily tracking poll results to become the first candidate to open a double-digit lead since Super Tuesday, when his competitor Clinton had a similar margin. On March 30 the poll showed Obama at 52% and Clinton at 42%. The Rassmussen Reports poll—taken during the same time frame—showed an Obama advantage of five points. These polls followed weeks of heavy campaigning and heated rhetoric from both camps, and another late-March poll found Obama maintaining his positive rating and limiting his negative rating, better than his chief rival Clinton, even considering Obama's involvement in controversy during the period. The NBC News and \"Wall Street Journal\" poll showed Obama losing two points of positive rating and gaining four points of negative rating, while Clinton lost eight points of positive rating and gained five points of negative rating.\n\nFollowing the revival of the controversy surrounding Wright in late April 2008, several polls showed that Obama's image among voters had suffered. According to a Gallup poll, Obama's nationwide favorable rating dropped from 50% to 45%, while Clinton's rating rose to 49%. In this poll, McCain edged Obama by four percentage points in general election match ups, while Clinton was tied with McCain. As of May 5, a Gallup poll of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters showed Obama with a 5% lead over Clinton for the Democratic nomination.\n\nIn poll data released May 3, 2008, from \"The New York Times\" and CBS News, Obama's favorable/unfavorable rating among white Democrats remained the same from last summer. During the same period, Clinton's unfavorable rating among black Democrats increased by 36 percentage points. The \"Times\" theorized that the opinion shift among blacks was due to tactics of the Clinton campaign labelled \"racially tinged\" by many vocal elements within the media, including the alleged \"amplifying\" by Hillary Clinton of the Wright affair at numerous times.\n\nSeveral commentators have drawn comparisons between the media's treatment of Barack Obama and Jeremiah Wright with the treatment of political candidates who ally themselves with white religious leaders who have made controversial statements. These critics said that John McCain actively sought the recommendation of John Hagee, who has been criticized for anti-Catholic and anti-Muslim statements and has described Hurricane Katrina as \"the judgment of God on the city of New Orleans\" for the city's \"level of sin\" (specifically a planned gay pride march). E. J. Dionne of the \"Washington Post\" contended that white religious leaders who make controversial statements often maintain their political influence. He specifically mentioned the remarks of Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, who agreed that gays, feminists, and liberals shared the blame for the 9/11 attacks, but faced no calls for denunciation by politicians with whom they had relationships. Frank Rich of the \"New York Times\" wrote that Rudy Giuliani's relationship with Monsignor Alan Placa had gained little media attention. (Placa is a longtime friend of Giuliani and performed his second wedding; Giuliani hired him to work in his consulting firm after Placa was barred from his priestly duties due to sexual abuse allegations.) Conservative commentator John Podhoretz said that the comparison of Wright with Hagee was \"entirely specious\", because Obama had a longstanding relationship with Wright and McCain had no personal relationship with Hagee.\n"}

Banner came up with the idea in the Fall of 1961. Burnett was then a regular on \"The Garry Moore Show\" and Andrews had appeared as a guest twice, performing the song \"Big D\" from the musical \"The Most Happy Fella\" in the first appearance; and in the show's 1961 Christmas special, she did a number with Burnett and fellow guest Gwen Verdon plus an early performance of \"My Favorite Things\" (three years before she performed it as Maria while filming \"The Sound of Music\").\n\nBurnett tells an anecdote about the development of the special. CBS programming executives Michael Dann and Oscar Katz were reluctant to approve it. They believed Andrews did not have sufficient name recognition and with Burnett appearing weekly on Moore's show the public would not tune in. Following a CBS promotional event, Burnett was unable to hail a taxi. Dann and Katz offered to wait until one appeared but Burnett said not to bother, that a truck driver would appear shortly and offer her a ride. Almost instantly a trucker appeared and offered Burnett a ride. Burnett received a telephone call from Katz immediately upon arriving home. Taking the trucker incident as a sign, he approved the special.\n\nMike Nichols wrote the script and co-wrote the song \"You're So London\" with Ken Welch. Writing began in February 1962 and the stars rehearsed for two weeks before the March 5 taping. Irwin Kostal was the musical director. George Fenneman served as the announcer. Burnett introduced the song \"Meantime\", written by Robert Allen and Al Stillman.\n\n\nAndrews and Burnett each perform one satirical interstitial in which each damns the other with faint praise; Burnett explains Andrews's disappointment at not being allowed to perform \"Ol' Man River\" in her \"natural\" bass voice while Andrews explains Burnett's sorrow at not getting to perform Mark Antony's speech from \"Julius Caesar\".\n\n\"Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall\" received mixed critical reviews. \"Billboard\" described the material as \"warm and delightful\" and noted \"the hilarious hand of Mike Nichols\" throughout. While describing the performance at taping as \"smooth\" and \"scintillating\", Cynthia Lowry of the Associated Press criticized the material, direction and photography of the program as aired, writing \"after gay, funny starts the comedy plummeted to banana-peel level\".\n\n\"Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall\" received the 1963 Emmy Award for Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Music. For her performance here along with her performance in 1963's \"An Evening with Carol Burnett\", Burnett won the Emmy for Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program or Series. The program also won the 1963 Rose d'Or Light Entertainment Festival Golden Rose.\n\nColumbia Records released an LP record of the special in June 1962. It peaked at number 85 on the \"Billboard\" chart.\n\nAndrews and Burnett re-teamed for \"Julie and Carol at Lincoln Center\" (1971) and \"\" (1989).\n\n\n"}

It was the first ever opera in the Komi language. It received its premiere at the State Opera House, Syktyvkar, the chief city of the Komi Republic, in the Russian Federation on 2 October 2009.\n\nIn 2008, Noskov began to rework an unpublished verse libretto by Albert Vaneev, originally written in 1984 and based on the life of the major Komi poet Ivan Kuratov. It focussed on Kuratov's career as a teacher in Ust-Sysolsk in the 1860s, where he promoted Komi culture in the face of opposition from the local Russophile and tsarist authorities. The long gap between the composition of the libretto and the score is explained by the fact it was very difficult to find a composer sufficiently fluent in Komi. Noskov felt he had to adapt the libretto for several reasons: there was hardly any action; it contained anti-clerical sentiments associated with the former Soviet regime which were no longer relevant; and most of the audience, even in the Komi Republic, was more at ease speaking Russian than Komi. Noskov's solution to these problems was to extend the action to cover Kuratov's childhood as well as his old age in Kazakhstan and to translate parts of the text into Russian. The premiere was produced by Ija Bobrakova; it was difficult to find performers with sufficient command of Komi to sing the roles and some had to have the words with them on stage.\n\n"}

Other radio and electrical installations throughout the country were also attacked. Sixteen employees of RTS died when a single NATO missile hit the building. Many were trapped for days, only communicating over mobile phones. The station returned to the air 24 hours later from a secret location. The building of the Russian church nearby was also seriously damaged.\n\nNATO Headquarters justified the bombing with two arguments; firstly, that it was necessary \"to disrupt and degrade the command, control and communications network\" of the Yugoslav Armed Forces, and secondly, that the RTS headquarters was a dual-use object which \"was making an important contribution to the propaganda war which orchestrated the campaign against the population of Kosovo\". The British Broadcasting Corporation reported that the station was targeted because of its role in Belgrade's propaganda campaign. \n\nTim Judah and others stated that RTS had been broadcasting Serb nationalist propaganda, which demonised ethnic minorities and legitimised Serb atrocities against them. A new building has since been built next to the bomb-damaged one, and a monument has been erected to those killed in the attack.\n\nWith the bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters, NATO recognized that media is a weapon during war. France was opposed to the attack; there was considerable disagreement between the United States and the French government regarding the legitimacy and legality of the bombing.\nAmnesty International stated that the NATO bombing was a war crime, and Noam Chomsky views it as an act of terrorism.\n\nIn 2001, the European Court of Human Rights declared inadmissible a case brought on behalf of the station's employees by six Yugoslav citizens against NATO. Dragoljub Milanović, general manager of Radio Television of Serbia, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for failing to evacuate the building. According to an Amnesty article published in 2009, nobody was held accountable for the attack itself, and no justice for the victims has been made.\n\nThe building itself remains as it was left by the bombing.\n\nWhile giving a speech at the Overseas Press Club sixtieth anniversary dinner, held on Thursday evening 22 April 1999 EST at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City, US envoy to Yugoslavia Richard Holbrooke reacted to the NATO's bombing of the RTS headquarters almost immediately after it took place: \"Eason Jordan told me just before I came up here that while we've been dining tonight, the air strikes hit Serb TV and took out the Serb television, and at least for the time being they’re off the air. That is an enormously important event, if it is in fact as Eason reported it, and I believe everything CNN tells me. If, in fact, they're off the air even temporarily, as all of you know, one of the three key pillars, along with the security forces and the secret police, have been at least temporarily removed. And it is an enormously important and, I think, positive development.\"\n\nA report prepared by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) entitled \"Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" concluded that the TV station's broadcasts to generate support for the war was not sufficient to make the RTS building a military target, but that the TV network had been part of the overall military communication system of the Serbian government, thus making the RTS building a legitimate military target. It said:\n\nIn regards to civilian casualties, it further stated that though they were, \"unfortunately high, they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate.\"\n\nIn the case Markovic v. Italy, the European Court of Human Rights found that the government of Italy had not violated human rights. However, in 2002, Dragoljub Milanović, the general manager of RTS, was sentenced to 10 years in prison because he had not ordered the workers in the building to evacuate, despite knowing that the building could be bombed.\n\nSian Jones, Balkans expert from Amnesty International stated the following about the attack:\nHuman Rights Watch also condemned the attack, stating that:\nOn 23 May 2011, Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) issued an official apology for the way their programming was misused for spreading propaganda and discrediting political opponents in the 1990s, and for the fact that their broadcasts had \"hurt the feelings, moral integrity and dignity of the citizens of Serbia, humanist-oriented intellectuals, members of the political opposition, critically minded journalists, certain minorities in Serbia, minority religious groups in Serbia, as well as certain neighbouring peoples and states.\".\n\nThe American news agency, the Associated Press, wrote:\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "61086", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61086", "title": "Ostpolitik", "text": "Ostpolitik\n\nNeue Ostpolitik (German for \"new eastern policy\"), or Ostpolitik for short, was the normalization of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, or West Germany) and Eastern Europe, particularly the German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany) beginning in 1969. Influenced by Egon Bahr, who proposed \"change through rapprochement\" in a 1963 speech at the Evangelische Akademie Tutzing, the policies were implemented beginning with Willy Brandt, fourth Chancellor of the FRG from 1969 to 1974.\n\nOstpolitik was an effort to break with the policies of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which was the elected government of West Germany from 1949 until 1969. The Christian Democrats under Konrad Adenauer and his successors tried to combat the Communist regime of East Germany, while Brandt's Social Democrats tried to achieve a certain degree of cooperation with East Germany.\n\nThe term Ostpolitik has since been applied to Pope Paul VI's efforts to engage Eastern European countries during the same period. The term \"Nordpolitik\" was also coined to describe similar rapprochement policies between North and South Korea beginning in the 1980s.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Allied-occupied Germany was split into two states: the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, or West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany). Initially, both governments claimed that they represented the entire German nation. However, the Federal Republic saw itself as the only German government with democratic legitimacy. Later, at the end of the 1960s, the communist government of the GDR claimed that there was no longer a common German nation as the GDR had established a \"socialist\" nation.\n\nThe Christian Democratic Union (CDU) political party dominated West German governments from 1949 to 1969. These governments refused to have any contact with the GDR government due to its undemocratic character, and the Hallstein Doctrine stipulated that the FRG would withdraw diplomatic contact from any country that established diplomatic relations with the GDR. The first application of the Hallstein Doctrine was in 1957, when the FRG withdrew recognition of Yugoslavia after it accepted a GDR ambassador. In the 1960s it became obvious that this policy would not work forever. When the Federal Republic established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1965, the Arab states countered by breaking off relations with the Federal Republic and establishing relations with the GDR.\n\nEven before his election as Chancellor, Willy Brandt, the Social Democratic mayor of West Berlin, argued for and pursued policies that would ease tensions between the two German states, generally in the interest of cross-border commerce. His proposed new \"Ostpolitik\" held that the Hallstein Doctrine did not help to undermine the communist regime or even lighten the situation of the Germans in the GDR. Brandt believed that collaboration with the communists would foster German-German encounters and trade that would undermine the communist government over the long term.\n\nNonetheless, he stressed that his new \"Ostpolitik\" did not neglect the close ties of the Federal Republic with Western Europe and the United States or its membership in NATO. Indeed, by the late 1960s, the unwavering stance of the Hallstein Doctrine was actually considered detrimental to US interests; numerous American advisors and policymakers, most notably Henry Kissinger, urged Bonn to be more flexible. At the same time, other West European countries entered a period of more daring policy directed to the East. When the Brandt government became Chancellor in 1969, the same politicians now feared a more independent German \"Ostpolitik\", a new \"Rapallo\". France feared that West Germany would become more powerful after détente; Brandt ultimately resorted to pressuring the French government into endorsing his policy by holding out German financial contributions to the European Common Agricultural Policy.\n\nThe easing of tensions with the East envisioned by \"Ostpolitik\" necessarily began with the Soviet Union, the only Eastern Bloc state with which the Federal Republic had formal diplomatic ties (despite the aforementioned Hallstein Doctrine). In 1970 Brandt signed the Treaty of Moscow, renouncing the use of force and recognizing the current European borders. Later that year, Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, in the process formally recognizing the People's Republic of Poland. The Treaty of Warsaw essentially repeated the Moscow treaty, and in particular reiterated the Federal Republic's recognition of the Oder–Neisse line. Treaties with other Eastern European countries followed.\n\nThe most controversial agreement was the Basic Treaty of 1972 with East Germany, establishing formal relations between the two German states for the first time since partition. The situation was complicated by the Federal Republic's longstanding claim to represent the entire German nation; Chancellor Brandt sought to smooth over this point by repeating his 1969 statement that although two states exist in Germany, they cannot regard one another as foreign countries.\nThe conservative CDU opposition party in the Bundestag refused the Basic Treaty because they thought that the government gave away some Federal positions too easily. They also criticized flaws like the unintentional publishing of the \"Bahr-Papier\", a paper in which Brandt's right hand Egon Bahr had agreed with Soviet diplomat Valentin Falin on essential issues.\n\nThe Brandt government, a coalition of Social Democrats and Free Democrats, lost a number of MPs to the CDU opposition in protest over the Basic Treaty. In April 1972 it even seemed that opposition leader Rainer Barzel had enough support to become the new Chancellor, but in the parliamentary decision he came two votes short. Later emerged that the GDR had paid those two CDU deputies to vote against Barzel.\nNew general elections in November 1972 gave the Brandt government a victory, and on May 11, 1973 the Federal Parliament approved the Basic Treaty.\n\nAccording to the Basic Treaty the Federal Republic and GDR accepted each other's de facto ambassadors, termed \"permanent representatives\" for political reasons. The mutual recognition opened the door for both states to join the United Nations, as the Federal Republic's claim to representing the entire German nation was essentially dropped by the act of recognizing its Eastern counterpart.\n\nThe CDU/CSU persuaded the FDP to defect from its coalition with the SPD in 1982, and thus CDU leader Helmut Kohl became Chancellor of West Germany. However, he did not change West German policy towards the GDR. Such was the consensus that \"Ostpolitik\" had been vindicated that Bavarian Minister-President Franz Josef Strauß, who had fiercely fought against the Basic Treaty and was Kohl's main opponent within the CDU/CSU bloc, secured the passage of a Kohl-initiated loan of 3 billion marks to the GDR in 1983.\n\nOstpolitik is also the name given to Pope Paul VI's policies towards the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states. Trying to improve the condition of Christians in general and Catholics in particular behind the Iron Curtain, he engaged in dialogue with Communist authorities at several levels, receiving Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and USSR President Nikolai Podgorny in 1966 and 1967 in the Vatican. The situation of the Church in Poland, Hungary and Romania improved somewhat during his pontificate.\n\nSouth Korea's 1980s policy of \"Nordpolitik\" was named in allusion to \"Ostpolitik\". \n\nA similar concept is Sunshine Policy, which is the main North Korea policies of the Democratic Party of Korea.\n\nTaiwan's China policy of \"Mainlandpolitik\" is named in allusion to \"Ostpolitik\".\n\nThese are West German treaties that have Ostpolitik as a primary or secondary policy goal.\nLater agreements in the period of Christian Democrat Helmut Kohl (from 1982 through German reunification in 1990), although dealing with similar issues and having similar goals, are not considered to be \"Ostpolitik\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38596667", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38596667", "title": "Passion Play of Iztapalapa", "text": "Passion Play of Iztapalapa\n\nPassion Play of Iztapalapa is an annual event during Holy Week in the Iztapalapa borough of Mexico City. It one of the oldest and most elaborate passion plays in Mexico as well as the best known, covered media both in Mexico and abroad. Unlike others in Latin America, its origins are not in the colonial period but rather a cholera epidemic in the 19th century, which gave rise to a procession to petition relief. Over time, the procession included a passion play which grew over time to include various scenes related to Holy Week. Today, the play includes not only hundreds of actors, but also thousands of men called “Nazarenes” who carry their own crosses to follow the actor chosen to play Jesus to the site where the crucifixion is reenacted. While the event is still primarily religious, it has also become a rite of identity for Iztapalapa (only residents of certain communities may participate) as well as a major tourism attraction for both the borough and the city.\n\nIn Mexico, many communities stage processions and passion plays for Good Friday, which in some places extends into other days of Holy Week. The Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa holds the largest and most elaborate of these, with up to 5,000 people participating and 150 of these with speaking roles. While a religious event principally, it is also a community event as only residents of the eight original communities of the borough (San Lucas, Santa Bárbara, San Ignacio, San Pablo, San José, San Pedro, La Asunción and San Miguel) can participate. The event is popular, drawing crowds of anywhere from 2.5 million to four million from Mexico and abroad during the week that scenes are performed. The play is also accompanied by news media helicopters and rows of police to keep control of the crowds.\n\nThe performances do not adhere strictly to the Bible as there are influences from other religious writings and even secular stories. While it is claimed that the original script for the play still exists, its performance has evolved over the years. Unique features to the Iztapalapa event include a character called the “Wandering Jew,” a harem belonging to King Herod and a spy and dog that accompany Judas Iscariot who personally brings Jesus to Pontius Pilate . Costumes are elaborate. The Roman soldiers wear leather sandals, bright tunics, plumed helmets and carry javelins and swords. A number of these ride horses lent by the Mexico City police, who train the actors.\n\nThe performances begin on Palm Sunday, with a procession along Calle Aztecas to the local parish church, where mass is held. Then the recreation of Jesus’s entry into Jerusalem is held. On Holy Tuesday, a scene depicting the miracle of the loaves and fishes is held. Crowds grow for Maundy Thursday at the Cuitlahuac Plaza, which begins with a procession, that finishes with the reenactment of the Last Supper, the washing of Jesus’ feet and Judas’ betrayal. When Jesus is arrested, Aztec drums and flutes announce the event. There is also a Procession of Silence which winds its way through the eight communities.\n\nThe play is intense and emotional, especially on Good Friday. The scene of Jesus being tried by Pontius Pilate occurs at midday at the Cuitlahuac Plaza. He is then turned over to the Pharisees. After this, about 10,000 take part in the procession to Calvary, carrying crosses of different sizes. This procession is an enactment of the Stations of the Cross. Jesus is kicked, beaten, whipped, and with cinematic blood. When he stumbles and falls, the crowds react. In the processional, Judas walks through the streets and the crowd call out “traitor” as the actor throws fake coins from a bag. At the top of the Cerro de la Estrella, which doubles as Mount Calvary, the sounds of nails being hammers come across the loudspeakers, and the crowd becomes very quiet. The actor is really bound to the cross and remains there for about twenty minutes. As the cross with Jesus is lifted it is not unusual to see people crying. After the crucifixion, the representation ends with Judas hanging himself alongside Jesus.\n\nIn addition to the man and women chosen to play Jesus and Mary, hundreds of young men called Nazarenes follow in the procession to the Cerro de la Estrella, barefoot, with crosses of varying sizes and often with crowns of thorns. They are accompanied by “Vírgenes de Pueblo” (Town Virgins) .\n\nThe annual passion play has become an important tourist attraction for Mexico City, especially the borough of Iztapalapa. The borough promotes tourism to the area during this time, offering guided tours of local museums, landmarks and green spaces. There are also specials in local hotels and restaurants. Around the staging areas, there is a carnival atmosphere with street vendors, amusement rides and vendors selling religious items. Many of the scenes take place on the esplanade in front of borough hall. In 1992, the city published a book about it called Semana Santa en Iztapalapa (Holy Week in Iztapalapa) . In 2009, a cultural festival called the Festival Cultural Pasión por Iztapalapa was created to run alongside the religious event. In the same year, two monumental sawdust carpets were created related to the event for a photographic exhibition on the plaza in front of borough hall. However, in remembrance of the solemnity of the occasion, the sale of alcohol in all venues, including bars, restaurants and nightclubs is banned for the entire week.\n\nThe production of the event is a massive undertaking. It requires the coordination of people from the eight original communities (barrios) of the borough, which amount to thousands of people who devote months rehearsing, creating costumes and sets, decoration of churches and streets and more. A number of the tasks as well as certain roles have been passed down for generations, such as providing first aid, creating the cloth Veronica uses to wipe Jesus’ face and certain acting roles although this has been challenged as more people want to participate. There are 136 principal actors that rehearse for 37 days, along with another 275 actors, 500 extras and about 2,000 Nazarenes that follow the actor playing Jesus when he carried the cross to his crucifixion. In addition, there is coordination with borough and city authorities who provide logistics in terms of thousands of police for crowd control, as well as ambulances, doctors, helicopters and water stations. Direct costs run in the hundreds of thousands of pesos, with millions more in city services. All of this is coordinated by a committee of Iztapalapa residents, called the Comité Organizador de la Semana Santa en Iztapalapa. It has over fifty members and its organization is partially based on indigenous traditions.\n\nAnother important role for the committee is to select the people to play the most important roles, especially the man and woman to play Jesus and Mary respectively. Tradition demands that those chosen to play these two roles may not date, drink, smoke or go to parties until they have finished their commitments, along with two newer ones, no tattoos or piercings. The candidates must also show that they have the economic means to buy the costumes. The candidates are investigated to ensure the meet these requirements. In addition, candidates to play Jesus, must also show that they have the physical endurance for the beatings, the carrying of a 100 kilo cross for four kilometers. Once the chosen candidate passes the two rounds of the selection process, he is then required to remain celibate for the intervening year before the performance, and begin physical training six months in advance.\n\nThe event is one of the most elaborate and oldest of its kind in Mexico. However, unlike most passion plays in Latin America, this does not date from the colonial period. Its origins are in a cholera epidemic in 1843, when the Iztapalapa area, outside of Mexico City proper, had a population of about 20,000, mostly indigenous. As a petition to ease the pestilence, the area began a procession to the “Señor de la Cuevita”( Lord of the Small Cave), an image of Christ entering Jerusalem on a donkey which is found in a small natural cave in the community of Pueblo Culhuacán . When the epidemic ended it was seen as a miracle and it became a permanent annual event. Soon after, the procession included a reenactment of the crucifixion on Good Friday and over time, the passion play grew to cover almost all of the events associated with Holy Week. Although its origins are in the 19th century, there is evidence of syncretism with indigenous traditions. The procession changed from the image in the cave to Cerro de la Estrella in 1920, after a heavy rain inundated the original site. This site was that of the Pyramid of Mixcoatl, associated with the New Fire ceremony. Aztec drums and flutes appear in the event as well.\n\nCatholic authorities have alternatively banned and approved the event since its inception. There is a letter dated 1867 asking Benito Juárez for help in its preservation against hostile church authorities. During the Mexican Revolution, the event was suspended due to clashes between governmental and church authorities. However a legend states that Emiliano Zapata lent his horses and ordered the renewal of the event in 1914. Church criticisms of the play have included that it deviates too much from the Biblical account, and it does have elements of other stories such as Dante’s Divine Comedy. Examples of deviation include King Herod’s harem which performs a sensual belly dance. However, the play has survived not only church prosecution but also governmental opposition to public displays of religion and Iztapalapa’s demographic change from indigenous to mestizo.\n\nThe popularity of the performance began to significant increase after World War II, attracting tourists first from within Mexico then from abroad. This popularity increased in the 1960s, when Vatican II legitimated passion reenactments. It has become the most famous passion play in Mexico. Television coverage of the event began in the 1980s, and since is regularly broadcast to the Spanish speaking world, as well as covered by media in the United States and Europe. While it remains first and foremost a religious event, it has also become a rite of local identity and has brought attention to the poverty of the borough. A documentary about the event called Iztapalapa, memoria y tradición was directed by Francisco Alatriste Torres of the Escuela Nacional de Antropología e Historia. The city government has declared the event to be an intangible cultural heritage of Mexico City, as part of an effort to gaining similar recognition from UNESCO . The increased tourism, as well as “competition” and influence from other passion plays have had an effect. The urban space where the play takes place has changed to accommodate its growth. Passion plays in the Philippines have had an influence leading to more realism in the violence, both in the flogging and the crucifixion. The actors have become younger as well as the Nazarenes, which now include some children.\n"}

{"id": "52989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52989", "title": "Poaching", "text": "Poaching\n\nPoaching has been defined as the illegal hunting or capturing of wild animals, usually associated with land use rights.\n\nAccording to \"Encyclopædia Britannica\", poaching was performed by impoverished peasants for subsistence purposes and a supplement for meager diets. Poaching was as well set against the hunting privileges of nobility and territorial rulers. By contrast, stealing domestic animals (as in cattle raiding, for example) classifies as theft, not as poaching.\n\nSince the 1980s, the term \"poaching\" has also referred to the illegal harvesting of wild plant species. In agricultural terms, the term 'poaching' is also applied to the loss of soils or grass by the damaging action of feet of livestock which can affect availability of productive land, water pollution through increased runoff and welfare issues for cattle.\n\nAustria and Germany refer to poaching not as theft, but as intrusion in third party hunting rights. While Germanic law allowed any free man including peasants to hunt, especially on the commons, Roman law restricted hunting to the rulers. In Medieval Europe feudal territory rulers from the king downward tried to enforce exclusive rights of the nobility to hunt and fish on the lands they ruled. Poaching was deemed a serious crime punishable by imprisonment, but the enforcement was comparably weak until the 16th century. Peasants were still able to continue small game hunting, but the right of the nobility to hunt was restricted in the 16th century and transferred to land ownership.\n\nThe development of modern hunting rights is closely connected to the comparably modern idea of exclusive private property of land. In the 17th and 18th centuries the restrictions on hunting and shooting rights on private property were being enforced by gamekeepers and foresters. They denied shared usages of forests, e.g. resin collection and wood pasture and the peasant's right to hunt and fish. However, comparably easy access to rifles increasingly allowed peasants and servants to poach by end of the 18th century.\n\nThe low quality of guns made it necessary to approach to the game as close as . For example, poachers in the Salzburg region then were men around 30 years of age, not yet married and usually alone on their illegal trade. Hunting was used in the 18th century as a theatrical demonstration of aristocratic rule of the land and had a strong impact on land use patterns as well. Poaching in so far interfered not only with property rights but clashed symbolically with the power of the nobility. During the years between 1830 and 1848 poaching and poaching related deaths increased in Bavaria. The revolution of 1848 was interpreted as a general allowance for poaching in Bavaria. The reform of hunting law in 1849 reduced legal hunting to rich land owners and the bourgeoisie able to pay the hunting fees and led to disappointment and ongoing praise of poachers among the people. Some of the frontier region, where smuggling was important, showed especially strong resistance. In 1849, the Bavarian military forces were asked to occupy a number of municipalities on the frontier to Austria. Both, in Wallgau (today a part of Garmisch-Partenkirchen) and in Lackenhäuser, (close to Wegscheid in the Bavarian forest) each household had to feed and accommodate one soldier for a month as part of a military mission to quell the uproar. The people of Lackenhäuser had had several skirmishes about poached deer with Austrian foresters and military, and were known as well armed \"pertly poachers\" (kecke Wilderer).\n\nPoaching, like smuggling, has a long counter-cultural history. The verb \"poach\" is derived from the Middle English word \"pocchen\" literally meaning \"bagged\", \"enclosed in a bag\".\nPoaching was dispassionately reported for England in \"Pleas of the Forest\", transgressions of the rigid Anglo-Norman Forest Law. William the Conqueror, who was a great lover of hunting, established and enforced a system of forest law. This operated outside the common law, and served to protect game animals and their forest habitat from hunting by the common people of England and reserved hunting rights for the new French-speaking Anglo-Norman aristocracy. Henceforth hunting of game in royal forests by commoners or in other words poaching, was invariably punishable by death by hanging. In 1087, a poem called \"The Rime of King William\" contained in the Peterborough Chronicle, expressed English indignation at the severe new laws. Poaching was romanticised in literature from the time of the ballads of Robin Hood, as an aspect of the \"greenwood\" of Merry England. The widespread acceptance of this common criminal activity is encapsulated in the observation \"Non est inquirendum, unde venit venison\" (\"It is not to be inquired, whence comes the venison\"), made by Guillaume Budé in his \"Traitte de la vénerie\". However, the English nobility and land owners were in the long term extremely successful in enforcing the modern concept of property, expressed e.g. in the enclosures of common land and later in the Highland Clearances, which were both forced displacement of people from traditional land tenancies and erstwhile common land. The 19th century saw the rise of acts of legislation, such as the Night Poaching Act 1828 and Game Act 1831 in the United Kingdom, and various laws elsewhere.\n\nIn North America, the blatant defiance of the laws by poachers escalated to armed conflicts with law authorities, including the Oyster Wars of the Chesapeake Bay, and the joint US-British Bering Sea Anti-Poaching Operations of 1891 over the hunting of seals.\n\nViolations of hunting laws and regulations concerning wildlife management, local or international wildlife conservation schemes constitute wildlife crimes that are typically punishable. The following violations and offenses are considered acts of poaching in the USA:\n\nIn 1998 environmental scientists from the University of Massachusetts Amherst proposed the concept of poaching as an environmental crime, defining any activity as illegal that contravenes the laws and regulations established to protect renewable natural resources including the illegal harvest of wildlife with the intention of possessing, transporting, consuming or selling it and using its body parts. They considered poaching as one of the most serious threats to the survival of plant and animal populations. Wildlife biologists and conservationists consider poaching to have a detrimental effect on biodiversity both within and outside protected areas as wildlife populations decline, species are depleted locally, and the functionality of ecosystems is disturbed.\n\nStephen Corry, director of the human-rights group Survival International, has argued that the term \"poaching\" has at times been used to criminalize the traditional subsistence techniques of indigenous peoples and bar them from hunting on their ancestral lands, when these lands are declared wildlife-only zones. Corry argues that parks such as the Central Kalahari Game Reserve are managed for the benefit of foreign tourists and safari groups, at the expense of the livelihoods of tribal peoples such as the Kalahari Bushmen.\n\nSociological and criminological research on poaching indicates that in North America people poach for commercial gain, home consumption, trophies, pleasure and thrill in killing wildlife, or because they disagree with certain hunting regulations, claim a traditional right to hunt, or have negative dispositions toward legal authority. In rural areas of the United States, the key motives for poaching are poverty. Interviews conducted with 41 poachers in the Atchafalaya River basin in Louisiana revealed that 37 of them hunt to provide food for themselves and their families; 11 stated that poaching is part of their personal or cultural history; nine earn money from the sale of poached game to support their families; eight feel exhilarated and thrilled by outsmarting game wardens.\n\nIn African rural areas, the key motives for poaching are the lack of employment opportunities and a limited potential for agriculture and livestock production. Poor people rely on natural resources for their survival and generate cash income through the sale of bushmeat, which attracts high prices in urban centres. Body parts of wildlife are also in demand for traditional medicine and ceremonies.\nThe existence of an international market for poached wildlife implies that well-organised gangs of professional poachers enter vulnerable areas to hunt, and crime syndicates organise the trafficking of wildlife body parts through a complex interlinking network to markets outside the respective countries of origin. Armed conflict in Africa has been linked to intensified poaching and wildlife declines within protected areas, likely reflecting the disruption of traditional livelihoods, which causes people to seek alternative food sources.\n\nIn a study conducted in Tanzania by two scientists named Paul Wilfred and Andrew Maccoll explored why the people in Tanzania poached certain species and when they are more likely to do so. They decided to interview people from multiple villages who lived near the Ugalla Game Reserve. To make sure the interview and their results were unbiased, they randomly picked several villages and several families from each village to interview.\n\nOne of the major cases of poaching is for bushmeat, or meat consumed from non-domesticated species of animals from all sorts of classes such as mammals or birds. Usually, bushmeat is considered a subset of poaching due to the hunting of animals regardless of the laws that conserve certain species of animals. Poachers hunt for bushmeat for both consumption and for profit.\n\nThe conclusion of the study found that many families would consume more bushmeat if there weren’t protein alternatives such as fish and the further away the families were from the reserve, the less likely they were to illegally hunt the wildlife for bushmeat. Finally, families were more likely to hunt for bushmeat right before harvest season and during heavy rains, as before the harvest season, there is not much agricultural work and heavy rainfall obscures human tracks, making it easier for poachers to get away with their crimes.\n\nPoverty seems to be a large impetus to cause people to poach, something that affects both residents in Africa and Asia. For example, in Thailand, there are anecdotal accounts of the desire for a better life for children, which drive rural poachers to take the risk of poaching even though they dislike exploiting the wildlife.\n\nAnother major cause of poaching is due to the cultural high demand of wildlife products, such as ivory, that are seen as symbols of status and wealth in China. According to Joseph Vandegrift, China saw an unusual spike in demand for ivory in the twenty-first century due to the economic boom that allowed more middle-class Chinese to have a higher purchasing power that incentivized them to show off their newfound wealth using ivory, a rare commodity since the Han Dynasty.\n\nIn China, there are problems with wildlife conservation, specifically relating to tigers. Several authors collaborated on a piece titled \"Public attitude toward tiger farming and tiger conservation in Beijing, China\", exploring the option of whether it would be a better policy to raise tigers on a farm or put them in a wildlife conservation habitat to preserve the species. Conducting a survey on 1,058 residents of Beijing, China with 381 being university students and the other 677 being regular citizens, they tried to gauge public opinion about tigers and conservation efforts for them. They were asked questions regarding the value of tigers in relations to ecology, science, education, aestheticism, and culture. However, one reason emerged as to why tigers are still highly demanded in illegal trading: culturally, they are still status symbols of wealth for the upper class, and they are still thought to have mysterious medicinal and healthcare effects.\n\nThe detrimental effects of poaching can include:\n\n\nMany tribal people in Africa, Brazil and India rely on hunting for food and have become victims of the fallout from poaching. In the Indian Kanha Tiger Reserve, they are prevented from hunting, and were illegally evicted from their lands following the creation of nature reserves aimed to protect animals. Tribal people are often falsely accused of contributing to the decline of wildlife. In India for example, they bear the brunt of anti-tiger poaching measures, despite the main reason for the tiger population crash in the 20th century being due to hunting by European colonists and Indian royalties. Stephen Corry, director of the human-rights group Survival International, argues that indigenous peoples have shaped landscapes and managed animal populations for millennia. He asserts that conservation organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund apply the term \"poaching\" unfairly to tribal people engaging in subsistence hunting while supporting trophy hunting by tourists for a fee.\n\nThe body parts of many animals, such as tigers and rhinoceroses, are believed to have certain positive effects on the human body, including increasing virility and curing cancer. These parts are sold in areas where these beliefs are practiced – mostly Asian countries particularly Vietnam and China – on the black market.\nTraditional Chinese medicine often incorporates ingredients from all parts of plants, the leaf, stem, flower, root, and also ingredients from animals and minerals. The use of parts of endangered species (such as seahorses, rhinoceros horns, binturong and tiger bones and claws) has created controversy and resulted in a black market of poachers. Deep-seated cultural beliefs in the potency of tiger parts are so prevalent across China and other east Asian countries that laws protecting even critically endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger fail to stop the display and sale of these items in open markets, according to a 2008 report from TRAFFIC. Popular \"medicinal\" tiger parts from poached animals include tiger genitals, culturally believed to improve virility, and tiger eyes.\n\nRhino populations face extinction because of demand in Asia (for traditional medicine and as a luxury item) and in the Middle East (where horns are used for decoration). A sharp surge in demand for rhino horn in Vietnam was attributed to rumors that the horn cured cancer, even though the rumor has no basis in science. Recent prices for a kilo of crushed rhino horn have gone for as much as $60,000, more expensive than a kilo of gold. Vietnam is the only nation which mass-produces bowls made for grinding rhino horn.\n\nIvory, which is a natural material of several animals, plays a large part in the trade of illegal animal materials and poaching. Ivory is a material used in creating art objects and jewelry where the ivory is carved with designs. China is a consumer of the ivory trade and accounts for a significant amount of ivory sales. In 2012, \"The New York Times\" reported on a large upsurge in ivory poaching, with about 70% of all illegal ivory flowing to China.\n\nFur is also a natural material which is sought after by poachers. A Gamsbart, literally \"chamois beard\", a tuft of hair traditionally worn as a decoration on trachten-hats in the alpine regions of Austria and Bavaria formerly was worn as a hunting (and poaching) trophy. In the past, it was made exclusively from hair from the chamois' lower neck.\n\nMembers of the \"Rhino Rescue Project\" have implemented a technique to combat rhino poaching in South Africa by injecting a mixture of indelible dye and a parasiticide into the animals' horns, which enables tracking of the horns and deters consumption of the horn by purchasers. Since rhino horn is made of keratin, advocates say the procedure is painless for the animal.\n\nAnother strategy being used to counter Rhino poachers in Africa is called \"RhODIS\", which is a database that compiles rhino DNA from confiscated horns and other goods that were being illegally traded, as well as DNA recovered from poaching sites. RhODIS cross-references the DNA as it searches for matches; if a match is found, it is used to track down the poachers.\n\nAnother initiative that seeks to protect Africa's elephant populations from poaching activities is the Tanzanian organization Africa's Wildlife Trust. Hunting for ivory was banned in 1989, but poaching of elephants continues in many parts of Africa stricken by economic decline.The International Anti-Poaching Foundation has a structured military-like approach to conservation, employing tactics and technology generally reserved for the battlefield. Founder Damien Mander is an advocate of the use of military equipment and tactics, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, for military-style anti-poaching operations. Such military-style approaches have garnered some criticism. Rosaleen Duffy of the University of London writes that military approaches to conservation fail to resolve the underlying reasons leading to poaching, and do not tackle either \"the role of global trading networks\" or continued demand for illegal animal products. According to Duffy, such methods \"result in coercive, unjust and counterproductive approaches to wildlife conservation\".\n\nChengeta Wildlife is an organization that works to equip and train wildlife protection teams and lobbies African governments to adopt anti-poaching campaigns.\nJim Nyamu's elephant walks are part of attempts in Kenya to reduce ivory poaching.\n\nIn 2013, Khamis Kagasheki, the Tanzanian Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, urged that poachers be shot on sight in an effort to stop the mass killing of elephants.\n\nIn December 2016, anti-poaching police units have been given the green light by Namibia’s government to return fire on poachers if fired upon. Environment minister Pohamba Shifeta said on social media: \"Our units are more than ready to deal with them without mercy. No more business as usual.\" Several poachers have been killed in shootouts or arrested following the shift in policy.\n\nA 2017 article in the journal \"South African Crime Quarterly\" by two University of Botswana academics, Goemeone Mogomotsi and Patricia Madigele, asserts that the government of Botswana's 'shoot-to-kill' policy against poachers adopted in 2013 is a \"legitimate conservation strategy\" and \"a necessary evil\" which has reduced poaching to the point it is thought to be ‘virtually non-existent’ in the country, and that neighboring countries like South Africa should also adopt such draconian measures in order to save wildlife from extinction.\n\nLarge quantities of ivory are sometimes destroyed as a statement against poaching (aka \"ivory crush\"). In 2013 the Philippines were the first country to destroy their national seized ivory stock. In 2014 China followed suit and crushed six tons of ivory as a symbolic statement against poaching.\n\nThere are two main solutions according to Frederick Chen that would attack the supply side of this poaching problem to reduce its effects: enforcing and enacting more policies and laws for conservation and by encouraging local communities to protect the wildlife around them by giving them more land rights.\n\nNonetheless, Frederick Chen wrote about two types of effects stemming from demand-side economics: the bandwagon and snob effect. The former deals with people desiring a product due to many other people buying it, while the latter is similar but with one distinct difference: people will clamor to buy something if it denotes wealth that only a few elites could possibly afford. Therefore, the snob effect would offset some of the gains made by anti-poaching laws, regulations, or practices: if a portion of the supply is cut off, the rarity and price of the object would increase, and only a select few would have the desire and purchasing power for it. While approaches to dilute mitigate poaching from a supply-side may not be the best option as people can become more willing to purchase rarer items, especially in countries gaining more wealth and therefore higher demand for illicit goods—Frederick Chen still advocates that we should also focus on exploring ways to reduce the demand for these goods to better stop the problem of poaching.\n\nAnother solution to alleviate poaching proposed in \"Tigers of the World\" was about how to implement a multi-lateral strategy that targets different parties to conserve wild tiger populations in general. This multi-lateral approach include working with different agencies to fight and prevent poaching since organized crime syndicates benefit from tiger poaching and trafficking; therefore, there is a need to raise social awareness and implement more protection and investigative techniques. For example, conservation groups raised more awareness amongst park rangers and the local communities to understand the impact of tiger poaching—they achieved this through targeted advertising that would impact the main audience. Targeting advertising using more violent imagery to show the disparity between tigers in nature and as a commodity made a great impact on the general population to combat poaching and indifference towards this problem. The use of spokespeople such as Jackie Chan and other famous Asian actors and models who advocated against poaching also helped the conservation movement for tigers too.\n\nPoaching has many causes in both Africa and China. The issue of poaching is not a simple one to solve as traditional methods to counter poaching have not taken into the account the poverty levels that drive some poachers and the lucrative profits made by organized crime syndicates who deal in illegal wildlife trafficking. Conservationists hope the new emerging multi-lateral approach, which would include the public, conservation groups, and the police, will be successful for the future of these animals.\n\nSome game wardens have made use of robotic decoy animals placed in high visibility areas to draw out poachers for arrest after the decoys are shot. Decoys with robotics to mimic natural movements are also in use by law enforcement.\nSturgeon and paddlefish (aka \"spoonbill catfish\") are listed as species of \"special concern\" by the U.S. Federal government, but are only banned from fishing in a few states such as Mississippi and Texas.\n\nSome poachers and their violent ends, as Matthias Klostermayr (1736–1771), Georg Jennerwein (1848–1877) and Pius Walder (1952–1982) gained notoriety and had a strong cultural impact till the present. Poaching was being used then as a dare. It had a certain erotic connotation, as e.g. in Franz Schubert's Hunter's love song, (1828, D 909). The lyrics of Franz von Schobers connected unlimited hunting with the pursuit of love. Further poaching related legends and stories include the 1821 opera Freischütz till Wolfgang Franz von Kobell's 1871 story about the Brandner Kasper, a Tegernsee locksmith and poacher achieving a special deal with the grim reaper.\n\nWhile poachers had strong local support until the early 20th century, Walder's case showed a significant change in attitudes. Urban citizens still had some sympathy for the hillbilly rebel, while the local community were much less in favor.\n\n\n"}

It is commonly found in sheep or goat husbandry culture in Africa, Asia and Europe. In Nigeria, Uzbekistan and Indonesia, ram fighting gains popularity among locals. Although categorized as a blood sport and an act of animal cruelty, ram fights rarely resulted in the death of the defeated ram, as the loser often is allowed to flee the arena.\n\nIn the wild, ram fights occurs naturally as a bovine behaviour to settle dominance hierarchy — a contest for alpha male status among virile rams, by ramming their heads into others. Traditionally, the male aggressiveness is not a desirable quality among sheep husbandry, as the sheep farmers prefer a docile sheep and eliminate the aggressive ones through series of selective breedings. This is the main practice of sheep domestication over time. However, farmers and shepherds traditionally may take ram fighting as an occasional pastime or entertainment, and look for this behaviour as the sign of virility, health, and also good gene and immune system.\n\nIn some cultures it has been developed into a \"game\" or a sport, or even held as \"national pastime\" which sometimes involves betting. Today in some countries, there are efforts to bring the fighting into mainstream by regulating the rules, ensure the fairness and the welfare of the fighting rams. In Uzbekistan, ram fighting is held as part of Asrlar Sadosi. In West Java, Indonesia, ram fighting is held as popular entertainment and ritual. It is associated with the town of Garut, near Bandung. In Nigeria, owners of the participating rams have made large investments to specially train their rams since their youth solely for competitions only, in which there are grand prizes, such as automotive vehicles, for the winners of these fights. \n\n"}
{"id": "6448980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6448980", "title": "Roman Carthage", "text": "Roman Carthage\n\nAfter the destruction of Punic Carthage in 146 BC, a new city of Carthage (Latin \"Carthāgō\") was built on the same land. By the 3rd century, Carthage developed into one of the largest cities of the Roman Empire, with a population of several hundred thousand. It was the center of the Roman province of Africa, which was a major breadbasket of the empire. \nCarthage briefly became the capital of a usurper, Domitius Alexander, in 308–311.\nConquered by the Vandals in 439, Carthage served as the capital of the Vandal Kingdom for a century. \nRe-conquered into the Byzantine Empire in 533/4, it continued to serve as a Roman (Byzantine) regional center, as the seat of the praetorian prefecture of Africa (after 590 the Exarchate of Carthage) until it was finally destroyed in the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb in 698.\n\nBy 122 BC, Gaius Gracchus founded a short-lived colony, called \"Colonia Iunonia\", after the Latin name for the Punic goddess Tanit, \"Iuno Caelestis\". The purpose was to obtain arable lands for impoverished farmers. The Senate abolished the colony some time later to undermine Gracchus' power.\n\nAfter this ill-fated attempt, a new city of Carthage was built on the same land by Julius Caesar in the period from 49 to 44 BC, and by the first century, it had grown to be the fourth largest city of the empire, with a population in excess of 100,000 people.\nIt was the center of the province of Africa, which was a major breadbasket of the Empire. Among its major monuments was an amphitheater, built in the 1st century, with a capacity of 30,000 seats.\n\nCarthage also became a center of early Christianity. Tertullian rhetorically addressed the Roman governor with the fact that the Christians of Carthage that just yesterday were few in number, now \"have filled every place among you —cities, islands, fortresses, towns, market-places, the very camp, tribes, companies, palaces, senate, forum; we have left nothing to you but the temples of your gods.\" (\"Apologeticus\" written at Carthage, c. 197).\n\nIn the first of a string of rather poorly reported Councils at Carthage a few years later, no fewer than 70 bishops attended. Tertullian later broke with the mainstream that was represented more and more by the bishop of Rome, but a more serious rift among Christians was the Donatist controversy, which Augustine of Hippo spent much time and parchment arguing against. In 397 at the Council of Carthage, the Biblical canon for the western Church was confirmed.\n\nThe Vandals under their king Genseric crossed to Africa in 429, either as a request of Bonifacius, a Roman general and the governor of the Diocese of Africa, or as migrants in search of safety. They subsequently fought against the Roman forces there and by 435 had defeated the Roman forces in Africa and established the Vandal Kingdom. \nGenseric was considered a heretic, too, an Arian, and though Arians commonly despised Catholic Christians, a mere promise of toleration might have caused the city's population to accept him.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to recapture the city in the 5th century, the Byzantines finally subdued the Vandals in the Vandalic War of 533–534. Using Gaiseric's grandson's deposal by a distant cousin, Gelimer, as either a valid justification or pretext, the Byzantines dispatched an army to conquer the Vandal kingdom. On Sunday, October 15, 533, the Byzantine general Belisarius, accompanied by his wife Antonina, made his formal entry into Carthage, sparing it a sack and a massacre.\n\nThereafter, the city became the seat of the praetorian prefecture of Africa, which was made into an exarchate during the emperor Maurice's reign, as was Ravenna on the Italian Peninsula. These two exarchates were the western bulwarks of the Roman Empire, all that remained of its power in the West. In the early seventh century, the exarch of Carthage overthrew the Roman emperor, Phocas.\n\nThe Exarchate of Carthage was first assaulted by the Muslim expansion initiated from Egypt in 647, without lasting effect. \nA more protracted campaign lasted from 670 to 683. In 698, the Exarchate of Africa was finally overrun by Hassan Ibn al Numan and a force of 40,000 men. Carthage was destroyed and its population was displaced to the neighboring medina of Tunis, which became the major regional center. Carthage's materials were used to supply the expansion of Tunis. The destruction of the Exarchate of Africa marked a permanent end to the Byzantine Empire's influence in the region.\n\n\n"}

Raab began his television career hosting the comedy show \"Vivasion\" in 1993. He became well known in 1994 after composing a hit single spoofing national football coach Berti Vogts. From 1999 to 2015, he hosted the late-night comedy show \"TV total\" and has also created a number of other television shows, such as \"Schlag den Raab\" and \"Bundesvision Song Contest\". In the early 2010s, Raab was considered the \"most powerful man in German entertainment television\".\n\nRaab is also known for his recurring role as producer, writer and performer of German entries to the Eurovision Song Contest beginning in 1998. He was the initiator of the national pre-selection show Unser Star für Oslo (Our Star for Oslo), in which Germany's winning entry at the 2010 contest in Oslo was determined.\n\nRaab grew up in Cologne with his sister and his parents, who owned a butchers shop. He attended Jesuit boarding school Aloisiuskolleg in Bonn. Before entering the entertainment business, he worked as a butcher in his parents' shop and studied law before dropping-out of university after five semesters. Raab lives in a suburb of Cologne and has two daughters (born 2004 and 2006) with his girlfriend Nike. Other than this, very little is known about Raab, who deliberately hides his private life from the media.\n\nStefan Raab became popular as host of the comedy show \"Vivasion\" for the German music television channel VIVA from 1993 to 1998.\n\nIn 1999, he created \"TV total\" which began airing in April 2001 on ProSieben, four times a week. While \"TV total\" started as a comedy format mainly showing and satirizing funny and embarrassing sequences from other television programs, it soon came to be more of a late night show featuring musical performances-- in some ways similar to \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" or \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\".\n\nAfter a boxing match against Regina Halmich in 2001 (rematch 2007) and a speed skating race against Claudia Pechstein in 2002, he also created several other celebrity sports events that are produced regularly, including \"TV total Turmspringen\" (high diving) and \"TV total Stock Car Crash Challenge\" (stock car racing). He also brought fun and variety to the show by invented new sports: In November 2003, he initiated the first \"official\" World Wok racing Championship in Winterberg, Germany. Modified Chinese woks are used to make timed runs down an Olympic bobsled track. The championship has taken place every year since, most recently in March 2011 in Innsbruck. The first \"Autoball EM\", autoball being a version of football played in cars and using an exercise ball to score goals was made in 2007.\n\nIn 2006, Raab invented the game show \"Schlag den Raab\" (German for \"Beat the Raab\", remade for British television as Beat the Star and as \"Beat your \"host\"\" in several other European countries), in which he competes against a contestant in various disciplines – some episodes of the show lasted more than five hours with excellent quotas.\n\nRaab frequently organizes \"PokerStars.de Nacht\", a poker event featuring some celebrity names in German entertainment.\n\nIn September 2012, he announced that he will be hosting a new talk show on ProSieben which will include political guests and begin airing on 11 November 2012. It will stand in direct competition with the self-titled talk show hosted by Günther Jauch.\n\nIn September 2013 Raab was one of four hosts (one from each big television network) at the federal election debate between chancellor Angela Merkel and her challenger Peer Steinbrück.\n\nIn mid-2015, Raab announced his retirement from television and stated that he would remain hosting until the end of the year. The last episode of his show \"TV total\" aired on 16 December and the last episode of \"Schlag den Raab\" aired on 19 December 2015.\n\nRaab began working as a freelance producer and composer of jingles and radio commercials in 1990 at his own studio in Cologne.\n\nFrom 1994 onwards, he produced a number of popular songs, including \"Böörti Böörti Vogts\" (a song about Berti Vogts), \"Hier kommt die Maus\" (\"Here comes the mouse\", a tribute to the children's television series Die Sendung mit der Maus), \"Maschendrahtzaun\", \"Wir kiffen\", \"Gebt das Hanf frei!\" (\"Legalise Dope!\", featuring Shaggy and samples from German politician Hans-Christian Ströbele), \"Hol' mir ma' 'ne Flasche Bier\" (\"Get me a bottle o' beer\", containing samples from then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder), and \"Space Taxi\" from the soundtrack of the movie Traumschiff Surprise - Periode 1.\n\nHe wrote the song for the German entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 1998, Guildo Horn's \"Guildo hat euch lieb!\", and in the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 he took part himself, performing the nonsense song \"Wadde hadde dudde da?\". Raab cast the German entry for the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest in a talent show contest called \"SSDSGPS\" (\"Stefan sucht den Super-Grand-Prix-Star\", \"Stefan seeks the super Grand-Prix star\", satirising the title of the German Idol series Deutschland sucht den Superstar, \"DSDS\"). The winner, Maximilian Mutzke, came in eighth place.\n\nBored with the Eurovision Song Contest, Raab came up with the Bundesvision Song Contest in 2005 (\"Bundes\"republik Deutschland = Federal Republic of Germany). The contest features representatives from each of the 16 states of Germany and stipulates that their song has to be at least partly in German.\n\nIn 2009, Raab was approached by the public broadcaster NDR, a member of the ARD broadcasting consortium, to jointly organise a national preselection in order to determine the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. It was revealed that Raab initially refused the request, but that his television network ProSieben accepted the offer to work with ARD/NDR.

{"id": "428246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428246", "title": "Tampico Affair", "text": "Tampico Affair\n\nThe Tampico Affair began as a minor incident involving U.S. sailors and Mexican land forces loyal to Mexican dictator General Victoriano Huerta during the \"guerra de las facciones\" (faction wars) phase of the Mexican Revolution. A misunderstanding occurred on April 9, 1914, but developed into a breakdown of diplomatic relations between the two countries. As a result, the United States invaded the port city of Veracruz, occupying it for more than six months. This contributed to the fall of President Victoriano Huerta, who resigned in July 1914.\n\nIn the midst of the Mexican Revolution, \"de facto\" President Huerta struggled to defend his power and territory from the forces of Emiliano Zapata in the state of Morelos and the rapid advance of the Northern opposition Constitutionalists under the leadership of Venustiano Carranza. By March 26, 1914, Carranza's forces were from the prosperous coastal oil town of Tampico, Tamaulipas. There was a considerable settlement of U.S. citizens in the area due to the immense investment by U.S. firms in the local oil industry. Several U.S. Navy warships commanded by Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo were deployed off the coast for the stated purpose of protecting American citizens and property.\n\nThe U.S. occupation of Veracruz resulted in widespread anti-American sentiment among Mexican residents, and other U.S. warships were used to evacuate U.S. nationals from both the Gulf Coast and the west coast of Mexico, taking them to refugee centers in San Diego, California; Texas City, Texas; and New Orleans. As a result of anti-American sentiment, Mexico maintained neutrality during World War I, refusing to support the U.S. in Europe, all the while continuing to do business with Germany. With the U.S. threatening to invade in 1918 to take control of Tampico oil fields, Mexican President Venustiano Carranza threatened to have them destroyed to prevent their falling under U.S. control.\n\nBy the spring of 1914, diplomatic relations between the US and Mexico were strained. US President Woodrow Wilson refused to recognize the presidency of Mexican General Victoriano Huerta, who had been installed as president the previous year after Huerta and the conservative rebel General Félix Díaz, a nephew of Porfirio Díaz, had signed the Embassy Pact with the approval of US Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson, who had since been removed by the president. The instability caused by the ongoing Mexican Revolution threatened US lives and economic interests in Mexico.\n\nAlthough Tampico was besieged by Constitutionalist forces, relations between the US forces and Huerta's federal garrison remained amicable. The gunboat , one of the few US Navy vessels able to sail up the Pánuco River through the shallow harbor entrance, had followed a request of the Mexican government to present a 21-gun salute to the Mexican flag three times on April 2, 1914, to pay tribute to the celebrated occupation of Puebla in 1867 by Mexican General Porfirio Díaz in the last phases of the war to expel the forces supporting the French intervention in Mexico.\n\nRelations between the US and Huerta deteriorated on April 9, when Mexican soldiers detained nine US sailors in Tampico. The commander of the \"Dolphin\" had tasked a purser and eight sailors with the purchase and pickup of urgently-needed 440 gallons of gasoline fuel from a dealer located near a tense defensive position at Iturbide Bridge that was held by Huerta's forces. The defenders of the bridge anticipated an attack after skirmishes with Constitutionalist forces on the two preceding days. Nine US sailors on a whaleboat flying the US flag were dispatched to the warehouse along a canal. According to the sailors' account, seven of them were moving the cans of fuel (either 5-gallon or 55-gallon drums?) to the boat while two remained on the boat. Mexican federal soldiers were alerted to the activity and confronted the American sailors. Neither side could speak the other's language, and the sailors were not complying with commands from the soldiers. The Mexicans raised their rifles to the Americans, including the sailors still on the boat, and forcibly escorted them to the police headquarters for questioning.\n\nAlthough the sailors had been released after only a few minutes, Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo, the commander of U.S. naval forces in the area, demanded a 21-gun salute and a formal apology from Huerta's government. Mexican President refused to have his forces raise the US flag on Mexican soil to provide a 21-gun salute.\n\nTwo weeks later, negotiations were at a standstill whe President Wilson asked the US Congress for permission for an armed invasion of the area. Although the request was granted two days later, the US had already begun to occupy Veracruz.\n\nPresident Wilson backed Mayo and ordered an increase in US forces in Mexican waters. On April 18, , Lieutenant Allen B. Reed, commanding, tender for the Pacific Fleet First Torpedo Flotilla, , Lieutenant Kenneth Heron, commanding, tender for the Pacific Fleet Second Torpedo Flotilla and submarines and departed San Pedro, California for San Diego. On April 22, \"Iris\" and five torpedo boats , , , and , of the Pacific Fleet First Torpedo Flotilla, Lieutenant Commander Edwin H. Dodd, commanding, departed San Diego for Mazatlan.\n\nOn April 22, President Wilson received the backing of Congress for the use of military force to resolve the conflict with Huerta. The day before, he had ordered the Navy to seize the port of Veracruz, which was preparing to receive a German ship, the SS Ypiranga, with an important cargo of ammunition intended for Huerta's troops. The message was relayed to Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, who commanded the squadron lying off the port of Veracruz. With the battleships , and the transport carrying 350 Marines, Fletcher received his orders at 8:00 AM on April 21. With impending poor weather conditions, Fletcher moved swiftly and requested for the US consul, William W. Canada, notify the local Mexican commander, General Gustavo Maass, that Fletcher's landing parties would be taking control of the Veracruz waterfront. After sending some 200 soldiers to present a token defense, General Maass received orders from Mexico City to evacuate his troops to the nearby towns of Tejería and Soledad.\n\nMexican legislators criticized the US, and mobs burned the US flag and looted US businesses in Mexico City.\n\nJust before 11:00 AM, a US landing party of 500 Marines and 300 sailors, commanded by Captain William R. Rush of USS \"Florida\", went ashore. Meeting no resistance, the Americans landed at Pier 4 and moved toward their objectives. The navy's sailors advanced to take the customs house, post and telegraph offices, and railroad terminal while the Marines were to capture the rail yard, the cable office, and the power plant. Establishing his headquarters in the Terminal Hotel, Rush sent a semaphore unit to the roof to open communications with Fletcher.\n\nWhile Maass retreated with his troops, the Mexican midshipmen at the Naval Academy worked to fortify their building. Fighting began when local policeman Aurelio Monffort fired on the Americans. He was killed by return fire, but his action resulted in widespread, disorganized fighting. Believing that a large Mexican force was in the city, Rush signaled for reinforcements and USS \"Utah\" sent its landing party ashore. Seeking to avoid further deaths, Fletcher asked Consul Canada to proxy a truce with the Mexican authorities. That effort failed when no Mexican leaders could be located.\n\nWith the likelihood of further casualties from deeper incursion into Veracruz, Fletcher ordered Rush to hold his position and remain on the defensive through the night. During the night of April 21–22, additional US warships arrived, bringing reinforcements.\n\nThat night, Fletcher determined that the complete occupation of Veracruz was necessary. He sent additional Marines and sailors ashore to begin landing around 4:00 a.m., and at 8:30 a.m., Rush resumed his advance, with ships in the harbor (USS San Francisco, USS Chester and USS Prairie), providing gunfire support.\n\nStriking near Avenida de Independencia, the Marines assaulted from structure to structure to neutralize resistance from the Huerta forces. On their left, the 2nd Seaman Regiment, led by Captain Edwin A. Anderson, made its way up Calle Francisco Canal.\n\nEven though the Mexican midshipmen had evacuated their school the previous evening, some Mexican civilians had taken defensive positions inside the building.\n\nRelying on incorrect information that his advance had been cleared of snipers, Anderson both failed to send out scouts and marched his men in parade ground formation. They encountered withering fire from the Mexicans and numerous casualties, forcing them to retreat. With supporting naval gunfire, Anderson resumed the attack and seized the Naval Academy and Artillery Barracks.\n\nAdditional US force landed in the morning, and by noon, the US had taken much of the city.\n\nIn the fighting, 19 Americans were killed and 72 wounded. Mexican losses were estimated at 150 to 170 soldiers killed and between 195 and 250 wounded; an unknown number of civilians were killed.\n\nMexican snipers were active until April 24, when Fletcher declared martial law. On April 30, the US Army's 5th Reinforced Brigade, under Brigadier General Frederick Funston, arrived and took over the occupation of the city. While many of the Marines remained, the naval units returned to their ships. While some in the United States called for a full invasion of Mexico, President Wilson limited American involvement to the occupation of Veracruz.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, US Naval units were monitoring the fight between Huerta's forces and the rebels while they proteced US citizens and interests. In Ensenada, Baja California, US Consul Claude E. Guyant and 250 of his fellow citizens were forced to seek safety in the US consulate building, as Mexican authorities were powerless to control anti-American demonstrations that had erupted on April 23. Guyant cabled Washington, \"Have taken refuge in consulate. Situation critical. Send warship immediately.\"\n\nUSS \"Cheyenne\" was sent from San Diego, California, to Ensenada with orders to protect US lives at any cost, including capturing the port if necessary. USS \"Iris,\" en route to Mazatlan, diverted course to Ensenada to assist \"Cheyenne\". They were to evacuate Guyant and other Americans. The welfare of approximately 50,000 US citizens living in Mexico was affected by the invasion of Veracruz. Refugee camps were set up in San Diego, Texas, and New Orleans to receive the Americans.\n\nUltimately, the US military transport ship USS \"Buford\" sailed from San Francisco in early May 1912, and made stops at numerous ports on the west coast of Mexico to pick up additional American refugees. USS \"Iris\" also picked up numerous American refugees during May 1914, including Clement Edwards, the US consul at Acapulco.\n\nBy May 4, 1914, a total of 71 US Navy ships were operating in Mexican waters.\n\nBattling rebel forces, Huerta was not able to mount a military opposition to the US occupation. After Huerta's downfall in July 1914, the US began discussions with the new government of Venustiano Carranza, but its forces remained in Veracruz for seven months, until November 23. That was almost six months after the end of the Niagara Falls peace conference, organized by the ABC countries (Argentina, Brazil, and Chile), held in the British Dominion of Canada.\n\nThe occupation contributed to Huerta's resignation in August 1914, as his southern armies' supplies ran out. In addition, the Tampico incident had later repercussions, as relations between the two countries were poor for a long time.\n\nIn January 1917, Germany sent the so-called Zimmermann Telegram, which implied that a Mexican alliance with Germany against the US would result in Mexico regaining territory taken from it by the US in prior wars and that Germany's forthcoming unrestricted submarine warfare campaign would guarantee defeat of the British and French. The British interception of Zimmermann's telegram and the German unrestricted submarine warfare against US merchant ships, soon afterward, were effectively both final justifications that President Wilson needed to request a declaration of war against Germany, in April 1917.\n\nAnti-American sentiment in Mexico from the Tampico incident was the chief reason that the government kept Mexico neutral in World War I. Mexico refused to participate with the US military excursion in Europe and granted full guaranties to German companies for keeping their operations open, specifically in Mexico City.\n\nPresident Wilson considered another military invasion of Veracruz and Tampico in 1917–1918, to take control of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Tampico oil fields. The relatively-new Mexican president, Venustiano Carranza, threatened to destroy the oil fields in case the Marines landed there. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "49306988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49306988", "title": "The Passion: New Orleans", "text": "The Passion: New Orleans\n\nThe Passion: New Orleans (also known as simply The Passion) is an American music television special that was broadcast by Fox on March 20, 2016. Based on the Dutch franchise of the same name (which in turn, was adapted from a BBC special) and produced by Dick Clark Productions and Eye2Eye Media, it was a contemporary retelling of the Passion of Jesus Christ set to popular music, through a mixture of live and pre-recorded segments broadcast from New Orleans.\n\nIt starred musicians Jencarlos Canela, Prince Royce, Trisha Yearwood, Chris Daughtry, and Seal. Tyler Perry hosted and narrated the special, while Nischelle Turner served as a correspondent for the procession of a cross to Woldenberg Park.\n\n\"The Passion\" received mixed reviews; critics noted that its secular soundtrack had weak context to the story, while the overall presentation of the special was compared to Super Bowl halftime shows and \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\". Particular praise was directed towards the performance of Seal, and how the presentation was received by the live audience. Tyler Perry's hosting received mixed reviews, with critics characterizing his narration as being restrained, and noting that the crucifixion of Jesus was presented solely through graphic dialogue. Shortcomings were also acknowledged in the special's format; despite an implied connection in promotion to the recent trend of live television productions of Broadway musicals (such as Fox's previous \"\"), its format was dissimilar to that of a traditional stage musical, and portions were pre-recorded. With a 4.3/7 household rating, the special was the second-highest-rated program of the night behind NBC's \"Little Big Shots\".\n\nIn December 2015, Fox announced that Tyler Perry would host and narrate a television special based on the final hours of Jesus Christ's life, broadcast live from New Orleans on March 20, 2016 (Palm Sunday), and produced by Eye2Eye Media and Dick Clark Productions. The special was formatted as a musical containing contemporary songs, and featured the procession of an illuminated cross from Champions Square (outside the Mercedes-Benz Superdome) to a stage at Woldenberg Park.\n\nThe story was portrayed using modernized imagery, and a script adapted from Bible scriptures by Peter Barsocchini of \"High School Musical\" fame, with the vetting of the American Bible Society. Producer Mark Bracco explained that \"The Passion\" would be \"modern\" and \"inclusive\", \"whether you are a believer or wants to hear Trisha Yearwood sing a Whitney Houston song\". Perry emphasized the significance of using the city of New Orleans as the setting for the special; drawing parallels between Hurricane Katrina and the resurrection of Jesus, he stated that New Orleans had \"literally [risen] again from a liquid grave.\"\n\nThe special was an American adaptation of a Dutch television special of the same name, which has been broadcast annually since 2011, and was, in turn, a localized version of the BBC's 2006 special \"Manchester Passion\". Creator Jacco Doornbos, who conceptualized the special in 2007 after learning that only 25% of people in the Netherlands were aware of the story of Easter, described \"The Passion\" as having become the largest annual television event in the Netherlands. The 2015 edition was seen by approximately 3.57 million viewers, a 46% share. As a live musical, \"The Passion\" also served as a follow-up to \"\", a live production of the 1971 musical \"Grease\" that Fox had broadcast two months prior, as influenced by NBC's recent live productions of stage musicals.\n\nAdam Anders, who previously worked on fellow Fox series \"Glee\", served as executive producer and music director for \"The Passion\". He elaborated that the goal of the special's soundtrack was to present well-known songs \"in a completely new context\". Chris Daughtry, an \"American Idol\" alumnus who was cast as Judas, stated that his songs—Imagine Dragons' \"Demons\" (which was performed as a duet with Jesus—played by Jencarlos Canela, during Judas's betrayal) and Evanescence's \"Bring Me to Life\", would be \"very different interpretations\" of the original tracks. Anders felt that the project fit well with Fox due to the network's history with music-based series, such as \"Glee\" (a series which Anders also worked on) and \"Empire\". Anders believed that the \"power\" of the presentation and its use of popular music helped influence the popularity of \"The Passion\" in the Netherlands—where, according to a recent survey, more people practiced atheism or agnosticism combined than theism. As such, Anders felt that the concept could be \"huge\" in the U.S. due to the level of religious practice in the country. He stressed that the integrity of the story would be maintained, remarking that \"I'm a pastor's kid, and I have a cheese alarm that goes off easily. I knew I couldn't have the disciples breakdancing.\"\n\nThe concept of \"The Passion\" was met with skepticism; Anders remarked that he had difficulty convincing musicians to allow use of their songs because the concept of \"The Passion\" was difficult to explain, while Chris Daughtry and Prince Royce were initially hesitant towards the concept of participating in an overtly religious production. Daughtry did remark that he enjoyed the idea of playing an antagionist, and felt that Judas was a \"very human\" and \"very relatable\" character. Prince Royce, who was cast as Saint Peter, similarly promised that he would take his role seriously and not act as \"the normal Prince Royce who takes his shirt off and gets the girls screaming\". Tyler Perry, who practices Christianity, was enthusiastic about being involved in such an event occurring in his hometown, and joked that contributing to a project that he did not personally create was like a \"vacation\". He felt that the modern setting and contemporary music would make the story more accessible to a general audience.\n\nCelebrity chef Carla Hall made a cameo appearance staffing a food truck that Jesus used to cater the Last Supper, while the Preservation Hall Jazz Band also appeared for a performance of \"When the Saints Go Marching In\". Nischelle Turner served as a co-host, primarily serving as a reporter along the procession route to Woldenberg Park.\n\n\n\"The Passion\" was broadcast by Fox on March 20, 2016; the telecast was preceded by the premiere of an \"Ice Age\" Easter special, \"\". In Canada, \"The Passion\" aired on Omni Television stations in simulcast with Fox. The special received a 4.3/7 household rating, putting it behind NBC's \"Little Big Shots\" as the second-highest rated show of the night. Netflix acquired international digital rights to \"The Passion\" outside of the United States and Netherlands; it was made available for streaming beginning on March 25, 2016.\n\nThe official soundtrack album for \"The Passion\" was released on March 18, 2016. Copies sold at Target and Walmart stores contained two exclusive bonus tracks each.\n\nThe soundtrack debuted at #8 on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart, while Chris Daughtry's cover of \"Bring Me to Life\" debuted at #2 on the April 9, 2016 \"Billboard\" Hard Rock Digital Songs chart, as the most-downloaded single from the soundtrack.\n\nJeff Jensen of \"Entertainment Weekly\" was critical of the production. He felt that \"The Passion\" \"had the potential to be divisive instead of uniting, an ecstatic religious experience for many, one more powerfully alienating experience for everyone else\". However, the soundtrack was panned for its questionable thematic relevance and drew comparisons to \"Moulin Rouge!\", as \"Calling All Angels\" gave \"affecting voice\" to Gethsemane, but \"Demons\" had \"offered only pat, unsatisfying explanation for Judas' betrayal.\" The portrayals were criticized for having \"boy band video camaraderie\", no depth, and no actual \"acting\" beyond \"poses of earnestly generated emotion\". Jensen also criticized the fact that \"The Passion\" consisted primarily of pre-recorded numbers despite being promoted as a live musical, and that the use of headsets in these scenes were meant to mislead viewers. Jensen described Perry's narration as being \"like a more subdued Ryan Seacrest counting down the minutes to New Year's\", but were repetitive and \"cliché\". He also noted that the procession interviewees had \"poignant stories, for sure,\" but that \"Turner's cheeriness and get-to-the-point hurriedness bent them all toward the rah-rah product endorsements.\" Jensen praised the Pontius Pilate scenes as being the \"most 'live' dramatic moment\" of the special, noting the \"inspired\" choice of \"We Don't Need Another Hero\", and Seal's \"soaring rendition\" of \"Mad World\". The resurrection scene, in which Jencarlos performed Katy Perry's \"Unconditionally\" from the roof of a Westin hotel near the stage to signify the resurrection of Jesus, was used to exemplify the shortcomings of \"The Passion\" as a whole, noting that \"a more effective final image would have been to place Jesus on the ground and moving among in his people as he did after his resurrection and as the Holy Spirit did on Pentecost. Instead, by setting Jesus apart from the audience, \"The Passion\" created a metaphor for how so many people experience God—far away; hard to see—and a metaphor for a TV spectacle full of simplistic passion but failed as engaging play.\"\n\nEmma Green of \"The Atlantic\" felt that \"in some ways, \"[The Passion]\" was the perfect portrayal of Jesus for the 21st century\", but that it \"[seemed] to suggest that the middle- and upper-middle class people watching at home will most resonate with the story of a poor fisherman if they see him dressed and coiffeured like he’s headed to Starbucks.\" The contributions of procession reporter Nischelle Turner were described as being a \"highly orchestrated woman-on-the-street reporting in the middle of a very expensive, highly inorganic spectacle\" not unlike \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\", and with political overtones surrounding Katrina. Green felt that the goal of \"The Passion\" was to emphasize \"strong performances, glitzy visuals, and perhaps a nostalgia for the early years of \"American Idol\"\", exemplified by the \"undeniably stunning\" resurrection scene (set to what she felt was \"arguably the worst Katy Perry song, and one that probably wasn't written about God or Jesus\"). In conclusion, \"The Passion\" was considered to be a \"solid take\" on the concept of live television musicals, but acknowledged the \"inherent tension between entertainment and faith: the former thrives on glitz and glam, while most religions explicitly reject that kind of showmanship in favor of humility before God.\" Green also suggested that having Jesus played by an African-American, in combination with the portrayal depicting Jesus being arrested by police officers, could have been a \"powerful political message\", and that the cross should have been carried by the homeless and poor if the producers \"truly wanted to make a statement about faith\".\n\nMike Hale of \"The New York Times\" likened \"The Passion\" to a Super Bowl halftime show, noting that while the concept could be excused as having a \"familial connection\" to traditional passion plays, \"the slick, relatively gaffe-free broadcast was intended not to arouse any unruly emotions or to offend any particular religious sensibilities\". Hale felt that Tyler Perry's narration was \"wooden\" in its writing, and suggested that the pop-rock power ballads used in \"The Passion\" \"demonstrated that generic love and breakup lyrics can be adapted to almost any circumstance, even to describe Christ's pain on the cross (which was also graphically described by Mr. Perry, in one of the show's stranger moments).\" However, Hale felt that the resurrection scene was the \"theatrical coup\" of the presentation, and commended it for producing the \"genuine\" moment of crowd members using their phones to record the scene, \"just as they would if the resurrection happened today\".\n\nGreg Evans of \"Deadline Hollywood\" described \"The Passion\" as being \"equal parts sermon and Super Bowl halftime show\", and \"overstuffed with sincerity, good intentions and hammy musical performances, all melting into a big batch of goo faster than a chocolate bunny in the sun.\" He noted that the production frequently switched between dramatic segments that were \"ruthlessly condensed and fully reliant on Perry's stagebound exposition\", Trisha Yearwood \"ostensibly [playing] Mary\" by singing songs from the main stage, and coverage and interviews from the procession. Evans felt that Seal's performance of \"Mad World\" was the \"best musical moment\" of the special, and also noted that unlike many Passion productions, the crucifixion of Jesus was not visually depicted, and that it \"entirely avoided the Passion pitfalls of history, handing the 'give us Barabbas!' cries to the crowd rather than any scapegoated minority. It was the evening’s rare moment of restraint, and rather inspired.\"\n\nRobert Blanco of \"USA Today\" felt that \"The Passion\" was \"well-sung, to be sure\" but wasn't \"well thought-out\", noting odd choices of songs such as \"Bring Me to Life\", which \"told you nothing specific about the turmoil of the man who was about to betray Christ\", and \"I Won't Give Up\", which \"[felt] far more romantic than maternal, just as Yearwood felt more Country Star than Virgin Mother\". It was also noted that because Yearwood only performed from the main stage, she did not directly interact with most of the cast, and it was also suspected that some of the performance segments may have been pre-recorded. In conclusion, Blanco felt that \"The Passion\" was part of a \"great artistic tradition\" of adaptations of the story of Jesus (such as \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" and \"Godspell\") that seek to \"speak to different people at different times in ways they can understand\", arguing that \"there's no question many in the crowd were moved; there were tear-stained faces during Perry's recounting of the crucifixion and cheers when he reached the resurrection. If you were one of those people for whom this version worked, then God bless. But please, have mercy on the rest of us.\"\n\nBethonie Butler of the \"Washington Post\" felt that despite the entertainment-oriented nature of the production and the lack of visual depictions of violence, \"The Passion\" was \"unapologetically religious\" and \"felt kind of like a service at a multicultural megachurch\". Owing to its use of segments featuring interviews from the procession route (which led to a Twitter user joking that it felt like a concert special aired during a PBS pledge drive), the format of \"The Passion\" was described as feeling \"like less of a play and more of a series of a musical performances, all of which were solid, if a bit zany.\" Butler touted that despite its nature as a spectacle, and viewers who did not believe that the portrayals were biblically accurate, \"many were moved at the sight of Jesus and Christianity front and center on their television set, not to mention that cross glowing down Bourbon Street\", and that the significance of \"The Passion\"s New Orleans setting resonated best with the live audience.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30030", "title": "Treaty of Versailles", "text": "Treaty of Versailles\n\nThe Treaty of Versailles () was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end. The Treaty ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919 in Versailles, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand which directly led to World War I. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I signed separate treaties. Although the armistice, signed on 11 November 1918, ended the actual fighting, it took six months of Allied negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. The treaty was registered by the Secretariat of the League of Nations on 21 October 1919.\n\nOf the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required \"Germany [to] accept the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing all the loss and damage\" during the war (the other members of the Central Powers signed treaties containing similar articles). This article, Article 231, later became known as the War Guilt clause. The treaty required Germany to disarm, make ample territorial concessions, and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. In 1921 the total cost of these reparations was assessed at 132 billion marks (then $31.4 billion or £6.6 billion, roughly equivalent to US $442 billion or UK £284 billion in 2018). At the time economists, notably John Maynard Keynes (a British delegate to the Paris Peace Conference), predicted that the treaty was too harsh—a \"Carthaginian peace\"—and said the reparations figure was excessive and counter-productive, views that, since then, have been the subject of ongoing debate by historians and economists from several countries. On the other hand, prominent figures on the Allied side such as French Marshal Ferdinand Foch criticized the treaty for treating Germany too leniently.\n\nThe result of these competing and sometimes conflicting goals among the victors was a compromise that left no one content: Germany was neither pacified nor conciliated, nor was it permanently weakened. The problems that arose from the treaty would lead to the Locarno Treaties, which improved relations between Germany and the other European powers, and the re-negotiation of the reparation system resulting in the Dawes Plan, the Young Plan, and the indefinite postponement of reparations at the Lausanne Conference of 1932.\n\nAlthough it is often referred to as the \"Versailles Conference\", only the actual signing of the treaty took place at the historic palace. Most of the negotiations were in Paris, with the \"Big Four\" meetings taking place generally at the Quai d'Orsay.\n\nOn 28 June 1914 the Bosnian-Serb Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in the name of Serbian nationalism. This caused a diplomatic crisis, resulting in Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia and sparking the First World War. Due to a variety of reasons, within weeks the major powers of Europe—divided into two alliances known as the Central Powers and the Triple Entente—went to war. As the conflict progressed, additional countries from around the globe became drawn into the conflict on both sides. Fighting would rage across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia for the next four years. In 1917, two revolutions occurred within the Russian Empire, which led to the collapse of the Imperial Government and the rise of the Bolshevik Party led by Vladimir Lenin.\n\nOn 6 April 1917, the United States entered the war against the Central Powers. The motives were twofold: German submarine warfare against merchant ships trading with France and Britain, which led to the sinking of the RMS \"Lusitania\" and the loss of 128 American lives; and the interception of the German Zimmerman Telegram, urging for Mexico to declare war against the United States. The American war aim was to detach the war from nationalistic disputes and ambitions after the Bolshevik disclosure of secret treaties between the Allies. The existence of these treaties tended to discredit Allied claims that Germany was the sole power with aggressive ambitions.\n\nOn 8 January 1918, United States President Woodrow Wilson issued a statement that became known as the Fourteen Points. This speech outlined a policy of free trade, open agreements, democracy, and self-determination. It also called for a diplomatic end to the war, international disarmament, the withdrawal of the Central Powers from occupied territories, the creation of a Polish state, the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic lines, and the formation of a League of Nations to guarantee the political independence and territorial integrity of all states. Wilson's speech also responded to Vladimir Lenin's Decree on Peace of November 1917, which proposed an immediate withdrawal of Russia from the war and called for a just and democratic peace uncompromised by territorial annexations. The Fourteen Points were based on the research of the Inquiry, a team of about 150 advisors led by foreign-policy advisor Edward M. House, into the topics likely to arise in the expected peace conference.\n\nAfter the Central Powers launched Operation Faustschlag on the Eastern Front, the new Soviet Government of Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany on 3 March 1918. This treaty ended the war between Russia and the Central powers and annexed of territory and 62 million people. This loss equated to a third of the Russian population, a quarter of its territory, around a third of the country's arable land, three-quarters of its coal and iron, a third of its factories (totalling 54 percent of the nation's industrial capacity), and a quarter of its railroads.\n\nDuring the autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse. Desertion rates within the German army began to increase, and civilian strikes drastically reduced war production. On the Western Front, the Allied forces launched the Hundred Days Offensive and decisively defeated the German western armies. Sailors of the Imperial German Navy at Kiel mutinied, which prompted uprisings in Germany, which became known as the German Revolution. The German government tried to obtain a peace settlement based on the Fourteen Points, and maintained it was on this basis that they surrendered. Following negotiations, the Allied powers and Germany signed an armistice, which came into effect on 11 November while German forces were still positioned in France and Belgium.\n\nThe terms of the armistice called for an immediate evacuation of German troops from occupied Belgium, France, and Luxembourg within fifteen days. In addition, it established that Allied forces would occupy the Rhineland. In late 1918, Allied troops entered Germany and began the occupation.\n\nBoth the German Empire and Great Britain were dependent on imports of food and raw materials, primarily from the Americas, which had to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean. The Blockade of Germany (1914–1919) was a naval operation conducted by the Allied Powers to stop the supply of raw materials and foodstuffs reaching the Central Powers. The German \"Kaiserliche Marine\" was mainly restricted to the German Bight and used commerce raiders and unrestricted submarine warfare for a counter-blockade. The German Board of Public Health in December 1918 stated that civilians had died during the Allied blockade, although an academic study in 1928 put the death toll at \n\nIn late 1918, a Polish government was formed and an independent Poland proclaimed. In December, Poles launched an uprising within the Prussian province of Posen. Fighting lasted until February, when an armistice was signed that left the province in Polish hands, but technically still a German possession.\n\nTalks between the Allies to establish a common negotiating position started on 18 January 1919, in the \"Salle de l'Horloge\" at the French Foreign Ministry on the Quai d'Orsay in Paris. Initially, 70 delegates from 27 nations participated in the negotiations. Russia was excluded due to their signing of a separate peace (the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk) and early withdrawal from the war. Furthermore, German negotiators were excluded to deny them an opportunity to divide the Allies diplomatically.\n\nInitially, a \"Council of Ten\" (comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan) met officially to decide the peace terms. This council was replaced by the \"Council of Five\", formed from each countries foreign ministers, to discuss minor matters. Prime Minister of France Georges Clemenceau, Prime Minister of Italy Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom David Lloyd George, and President of the United States Woodrow Wilson formed the \"Big Four\" (at one point becoming the \"Big Three\" following the temporally withdrawal of Vittorio Emanuele Orlando). These four men met in 145 closed sessions to make all the major decisions, which were later ratified by the entire assembly. The minor powers attended a weekly \"Plenary Conference\" that discussed issues in a general forum but made no decisions. These members formed over 50 commissions that made various recommendations, many of which were incorporated into the final text of the treaty.\n\nFrance had lost soldiers, including French men aged France had also been more physically damaged than any other nation (the so-called zone rouge (Red Zone); the most industrialized region and the source of most coal and iron ore in the north-east had been devastated and in the final days of the war mines had been flooded and railways, bridges and factories destroyed. Clemenceau intended to ensure the security of France, by weakening Germany economically, militarily, territorially and by supplanting Germany as the leading producer of steel in Europe. A position, British economist and Versailles negotiator, John Maynard Keynes summarized as attempting to \"set the clock back and undo what, since 1870, the progress of Germany had accomplished.\"\n\nClemenceau told Wilson: \"America is far away, protected by the ocean. Not even Napoleon himself could touch England. You are both sheltered; we are not\". The French wanted a frontier on the Rhine, to protect France from a German invasion and compensate for French demographic and economic inferiority. American and British representatives refused the French claim and after two months of negotiations, the French accepted a British pledge to provide an immediate alliance with France if Germany attacked again, and Wilson agreed to put a similar proposal to the Senate. Clemenceau had told the Chamber of Deputies, in December 1918, that his goal was to maintain an alliance with both countries. Clemenceau accepted the offer, in return for an occupation of the Rhineland for fifteen years and that Germany would also demilitarise the Rhineland.\n\nFrench negotiators required reparations, to make Germany pay for the destruction induced throughout the war and to decrease German strength. The French also wanted the iron ore and coal of the Saar Valley, by annexation to France. The French were willing to accept a smaller amount of reparations than the Americans would concede and Clemenceau was willing discuss German capacity to pay with the German delegation, before the final settlement was drafted. In April and May 1919, the French and Germans held separate talks, on mutually acceptable arrangements on issues like reparation, reconstruction and industrial collaboration. France, along with the British Dominions and Belgium, opposed mandates and favored annexation of former German colonies.\n\nBritain had suffered little land devastation during the war. However, the British wartime coalition was re-elected during the so-called Coupon election at the end of 1918, with a policy of squeezing the German \"'til the pips squeak\". Public opinion favoured a \"just peace\", which would force Germany to pay reparations and be unable to repeat the aggression of 1914, although those of a \"liberal and advanced opinion\" shared Wilson's ideal of a peace of reconciliation.\n\nIn private Lloyd George opposed revenge and attempted to compromise between Clemenceau's demands and the Fourteen Points, because Europe would eventually have to reconcile with Germany. Lloyd George wanted terms of reparation that would not cripple the German economy, so that Germany would remain a viable economic power and trading partner. By arguing that British war pensions and widows' allowances should be included in the German reparation sum, Lloyd George ensured that a large amount would go to the British Empire.\n\nLloyd George also intended to maintain a European balance of power to thwart a French attempt to establish itself as the dominant European Power. A revived Germany would be a counterweight to France and a deterrent to Bolshevik Russia. Lloyd George also wanted to neutralize the German navy to keep the Royal Navy as the greatest naval power in the world; dismantle the German colonial empire with several of its territorial possessions ceded to Britain and others being established as League of Nations mandates, a position opposed by the Dominions.\n\nPrior to the American entry into the war, Wilson had talked of a 'peace without victory'. This position fluctuated following the US entry into the war. Wilson talked of the German aggressors who there could be no compromised peace with. However, on 8 January 1918, Wilson delivered a speech (known as the Fourteen Points) that declared the American peace objectives: the rebuilding of the European economy, self-determination of European ethnic groups, the promotion of free trade, the creation of appropriate mandates for former colonies, and above all, the creation of a powerful League of Nations that would ensure the peace. The aim of the latter was to provide a forum to revise the peace treaties as needed, and deal with problems that arose as a result of the peace and the rise of new states.\n\nWilson brought along top intellectuals as advisors to the American peace delegation, and the overall American position echoed the Fourteen Points. Wilson firmly opposed harsh treatment on Germany. While the British and French wanted to largely annex the German colonial empire, Wilson saw that as a violation of the fundamental principles of justice and human rights of the native populations, and favored them having the right of self-determination via the creation of mandates. The promoted idea called for the major powers to act as disinterested trustees over a region, aiding the native populations until they could govern themselves. In spite of this position and in order to ensure that Japan did not refuse to join the League of Nations, Wilson favored turning over the former German colony of Shandong, in Eastern China, to Japan rather than return the area to Chinese control. Further confounding the Americans, was US internal partisan politics. In November 1918, the Republican Party won the Senate election by a slim margin. Wilson, a Democrat, refused to include prominent Republicans in the American delegation making his efforts seem partisan, and contributed to a risk of political defeat at home.\n\nIn June 1919, the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty they had agreed to among themselves. The government headed by Philipp Scheidemann was unable to agree on a common position, and Scheidemann himself resigned rather than agree to sign the treaty. Gustav Bauer, the head of the new government, sent a telegram stating his intention to sign the treaty if certain articles were withdrawn, including Articles 227, 230 and 231. In response, the Allies issued an ultimatum stating that Germany would have to accept the treaty or face an invasion of Allied forces across the Rhine within On 23 June, Bauer capitulated and sent a second telegram with a confirmation that a German delegation would arrive shortly to sign the treaty. On 28 June 1919, the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (the immediate impetus for the war), the peace treaty was signed. The treaty had clauses ranging from war crimes, the prohibition on the merging of Austria with Germany without the consent of the League of Nations, freedom of navigation on major European rivers, to the returning of a Koran to the king of Hedjaz.\n\nThe treaty stripped Germany of of territory and It also required Germany to give up the gains made via the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and grant independence to the protectorates that had been established. In Western Europe Germany was required to recognize Belgian sovereignty over Moresnet and cede control of the Eupen-Malmedy area. Within six months of the transfer, Belgium was required to conduct a plebiscite on whether the citizens of the region wanted to remain under Belgian sovereignty or return to German control, communicate the results to the League of Nations and abide by the League's decision. To compensate for the destruction of French coal mines, Germany was to cede the output of the Saar coalmines to France and control of the Saar to the League of Nations for 15 years; a plebiscite would then be held to decide sovereignty. The treaty \"restored\" the provinces of Alsace-Lorraine to France by rescinding the treaties of Versailles and Frankfurt of 1871 as they pertained to this issue. The sovereignty of Schleswig-Holstein was to be resolved by a plebiscite to be held at a future time (see Schleswig Plebiscites).\n\nIn Central Europe Germany was to recognize the independence of Czechoslovakia and cede parts of the province of Upper Silesia. Germany had to recognize the independence of Poland and renounce \"all rights and title over the territory\". Portions of Upper Silesia were to be ceded to Poland, with the future of the rest of the province to be decided by plebiscite. The border would be fixed with regard to the vote and to the geographical and economic conditions of each locality. The province of Posen (now Poznań), which had come under Polish control during the Greater Poland Uprising, was also to be ceded to Poland. Pomerelia (Eastern Pomerania), on historical and ethnic grounds, was transferred to Poland so that the new state could have access to the sea and became known as the Polish Corridor. The sovereignty of part of southern East Prussia was to be decided via plebiscite while the East Prussian Soldau area, which was astride the rail line between Warsaw and Danzig, was transferred to Poland outright without plebiscite. An area of was granted to Poland at the expense of Germany. Memel was to be ceded to the Allied and Associated powers, for disposal according to their wishes. Germany was to cede the city of Danzig and its hinterland, including the delta of the Vistula River on the Baltic Sea, for the League of Nations to establish the Free City of Danzig.\n\nArticle 119 of the treaty required Germany to renounce sovereignty over former colonies and Article 22 converted the territories into League of Nations mandates under the control of Allied states. Togoland and German Kamerun (Cameroon) were transferred to France. Ruanda and Urundi were allocated to Belgium, whereas German South-West Africa went to South Africa and the United Kingdom obtained German East Africa. As compensation for the German invasion of Portuguese Africa, Portugal was granted the Kionga Triangle, a sliver of German East Africa in northern Mozambique. Article 156 of the treaty transferred German concessions in Shandong, China, to Japan, not to China. Japan was granted all German possessions in the Pacific north of the equator and those south of the equator went to Australia, except for German Samoa, which was taken by New Zealand.\n\nThe treaty was comprehensive and complex in the restrictions imposed upon the post-war German armed forces (the \"Reichswehr\"). The provisions were intended to make the incapable of offensive action and to encourage international disarmament. Germany was to demobilize sufficient soldiers by 31 March 1920 to leave an army of no more than in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions. The treaty laid down the organisation of the divisions and support units, and the General Staff was to be dissolved. Military schools for officer training were limited to three, one school per arm, and conscription was abolished. Private soldiers and non-commissioned officers were to be retained for at least twelve years and officers for a minimum of with former officers being forbidden to attend military exercises. To prevent Germany from building up a large cadre of trained men, the number of men allowed to leave early was limited.\n\nThe number of civilian staff supporting the army was reduced and the police force was reduced to its pre-war size, with increases limited to population increases; paramilitary forces were forbidden. The Rhineland was to be demilitarized, all fortifications in the Rhineland and east of the river were to be demolished and new construction was forbidden. Military structures and fortifications on the islands of Heligoland and Düne were to be destroyed. Germany was prohibited from the arms trade, limits were imposed on the type and quantity of weapons and prohibited from the manufacture or stockpile of chemical weapons, armoured cars, tanks and military aircraft. The German navy was allowed six pre-dreadnought battleships and was limited to a maximum of six light cruisers (not exceeding ), twelve destroyers (not exceeding ) and twelve torpedo boats (not exceeding ) and was forbidden submarines. The manpower of the navy was not to exceed including manning for the fleet, coast defences, signal stations, administration, other land services, officers and men of all grades and corps. The number of officers and warrant officers was not allowed to exceed Germany surrendered eight battleships, eight light cruisers, forty-two destroyers, and fifty torpedo boats for decommissioning. Thirty-two auxiliary ships were to be disarmed and converted to merchant use. Article 198 prohibited Germany from having an air force, including naval air forces, and required Germany to hand over all aerial related materials. In conjunction, Germany was forbidden to manufacture or import aircraft or related material for a period of six months following the signing of the treaty.\n\nIn Article 231 Germany accepted responsibility for the losses and damages caused by the war \"as a consequence of the ... aggression of Germany and her allies.\" The treaty required Germany to compensate the Allied powers, and it also established an Allied \"Reparation Commission\" to determine the exact amount which Germany would pay and the form that such payment would take. The commission was required to \"give to the German Government a just opportunity to be heard\", and to submit its conclusions by . In the interim, the treaty required Germany to pay an equivalent of gold marks ($5 billion) in gold, commodities, ships, securities or other forms. The money would help to pay for Allied occupation costs and buy food and raw materials for Germany.\n\nTo ensure compliance, the Rhineland and bridgeheads east of the Rhine were to be occupied by Allied troops for fifteen years. If Germany had not committed aggression, a staged withdrawal would take place; after five years, the Cologne bridgehead and the territory north of a line along the Ruhr would be evacuated. After ten years, the bridgehead at Coblenz and the territories to the north would be evacuated and after fifteen years remaining Allied forces would be withdrawn. If Germany reneged on the treaty obligations, the bridgeheads would be reoccupied immediately.\n\nPart I of the treaty, as per all the treaties signed during the Paris Peace Conference, was the Covenant of the League of Nations, which provided for the creation of the League, an organization for the arbitration of international disputes. Part XIII organized the establishment of the International Labour Officer, to regulate hours of work, including a maximum working day and week; the regulation of the labour supply; the prevention of unemployment; the provision of a living wage; the protection of the worker against sickness, disease and injury arising out of his employment; the protection of children, young persons and women; provision for old age and injury; protection of the interests of workers when employed abroad; recognition of the principle of freedom of association; the organization of vocational and technical education and other measures. The treaty also called for the signatories to sign or ratify the International Opium Convention.\n\nThe delegates of the Commonwealth and British Government had mixed thoughts on the treaty, with some seeing the French policy as being greedy and vindictive. Lloyd George and his private secretary Philip Kerr believed in the treaty, although they also felt that the French would keep Europe in a constant state of turmoil by attempting to enforce the treaty. Delegate Harold Nicolson wrote \"are we making a good peace?\", while General Jan Smuts (a member of the South African delegation) wrote to Lloyd-George, before the signing, that the treaty was unstable and declared \"Are we in our sober senses or suffering from shellshock? What has become of Wilson's 14 points?\" He wanted the Germans not be made to sign at the \"point of the bayonet\". Smuts issued a statement condemning the treaty and regretting that the promises of \"a new international order and a fairer, better world are not written in this treaty\". Lord Robert Cecil said that many within the Foreign Office were disappointed by the treaty. The treaty received widespread approval from the general public. Bernadotte Schmitt wrote that the \"average Englishman ... thought Germany got only what it deserved\" as a result of the treaty. However, public opinion changed as German complaints mounted.\n\nThe surrendering of the German High Seas Fleet following the armistice, its internment, and eventual scuttling at Scapa Flow meant that Britain's primary war goal was achieved prior to the signing of the treaty. As a result, British policy towards Germany began diverging from France's almost from the moment the guns fell silent and focused on establishing Germany as a bulwark against the threat posed by the new Soviet Union. \n\nBy the 1930s, Lloyd George's position on the treaty has changed. In 1938, he published his memoir titled \"The Truth About the Peace Treaties\", in which he repudiated the terms of the treaty that bore his signature. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, following the German re-militarisation of the Rhineland in 1936, stated that he was \"pleased\" that the treaty was \"vanishing\", expressing his hope that the French had been taught a \"severe lesson\".\n\nThe signing of the treaty was met with roars of approval, singing, and dancing from a crowd outside the Palace of Versailles. In Paris proper, people rejoiced at the official end of the war, the return of Alsace and Lorraine to France, and that Germany had agreed to pay reparations. \n\nWhile France ratified the treaty and was active in the League, the jubilant mood soon gave way to a political backlash for Clemenceau. The French Right saw the treaty as being too lenient and saw it as failing to achieve all of France's demands. Left-wing politicians attacked the treaty and Clemenceau for being too harsh (the latter turning into a ritual condemnation of the treaty, for politicians remarking on French foreign affairs, as late as August 1939). Marshal Ferdinand Foch stated \"this (treaty) is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years.\"; a criticism over the failure to annex the Rhineland and for compromising French security for the benefit of the United States and Britain. When Clemenceau stood for election as President of France in January 1920, he was defeated.\n\nReaction in Italy to the treaty was extremely negative. The country had suffered high casualties, yet failed to achieve most of its major war goals, notably gaining control of the Dalmatian coast and Fiume. President Wilson rejected Italy's claims on the basis of \"national self-determination.\" For their part, Britain and France—who had been forced in the war's latter stages to divert their own troops to the Italian front to stave off collapse—were disinclined to support Italy's position at the peace conference. Differences in negotiating strategy between Premier Vittorio Orlando and Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino further undermined Italy's position at the conference. A furious Vittorio Orlando suffered a nervous collapse and at one point walked out of the conference (though he later returned). He lost his position as prime minister just a week before the treaty was scheduled to be signed, effectively ending his active political career. Anger and dismay over the treaty's provisions helped pave the way for the establishment of Benito Mussolini's dictatorship three years later.\n\nPortugal entered the war on the Allied side in 1916 primarily to ensure the security of its African colonies, which were threatened with seizure by both Britain and Germany. To this extent, she succeeded in her war aims. The treaty recognized Portuguese sovereignty over these areas and awarded her small portions of Germany's bordering overseas colonies. Otherwise, Portugal gained little at the peace conference. Her promised share of German reparations never materialized, and a seat she coveted on the executive council of the new League of Nations went instead to Spain—which had remained neutral in the war. In the end, Portugal ratified the treaty, but got little out of the war, which cost more than 8,000 Portuguese troops and as many as 100,000 of her African colonial subjects their lives.\n\nAfter the Versailles conference, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson claimed that \"at last the world knows America as the savior of the world!\" However, the Republican Party, led by Henry Cabot Lodge, controlled the US Senate after the election of 1918, and the senators were divided into multiple positions on the Versailles question. It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build a two-thirds coalition that was needed to pass a treaty.\n\nA discontent bloc of 12–18 \"Irreconcilables\", mostly Republicans but also representatives of the Irish and German Democrats, fiercely opposed the treaty. One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty, even with reservations added by Lodge. A second group of Democrats supported the treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Senator Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article 10, which involved the power of the League of Nations to make war without a vote by the US Congress. All of the Irreconcilables were bitter enemies of President Wilson, and he launched a nationwide speaking tour in the summer of 1919 to refute them. However, Wilson collapsed midway with a serious stroke that effectively ruined his leadership skills.\n\nThe closest the treaty came to passage was on 19 November 1919, as Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to permanently end the chances for ratification. Among the American public as a whole, the Irish Catholics and the German Americans were intensely opposed to the treaty, saying it favored the British.\n\nAfter Wilson's presidency, his successor Republican President Warren G. Harding continued American opposition to the formation of the League of Nations. Congress subsequently passed the Knox–Porter Resolution bringing a formal end to hostilities between the United States and the Central Powers. It was signed into law by President Harding on 2 July 1921. Soon after, the US–German Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Berlin on 25 August 1921, the US–Austrian Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Vienna on 24 August 1921, and the US–Hungarian Peace Treaty of 1921 was signed in Budapest on 29 August 1921.\n\nWilson's former friend Edward Mandell House, present at the negotiations, wrote in his diary on 29 June 1919:\n\nI am leaving Paris, after eight fateful months, with conflicting emotions. Looking at the conference in retrospect, there is much to approve and yet much to regret. It is easy to say what should have been done, but more difficult to have found a way of doing it. To those who are saying that the treaty is bad and should never have been made and that it will involve Europe in infinite difficulties in its enforcement, I feel like admitting it. But I would also say in reply that empires cannot be shattered, and new states raised upon their ruins without disturbance. To create new boundaries is to create new troubles. The one follows the other. While I should have preferred a different peace, I doubt very much whether it could have been made, for the ingredients required for such a peace as I would have were lacking at Paris.\n\nMany in China felt betrayed as the German territory in China was handed to Japan. Wellington Koo refused to sign the treaty and the Chinese delegation at the Paris Peace Conference was the only nation that did not sign the Treaty of Versailles at the signing ceremony. The sense of betrayal led to great demonstrations in China like the May 4th movement and the fall of the nascent Chinese Republic's government and poisoned relations with the West. There was immense dissatisfaction with Duan Qirui’s government, which had secretly negotiated with the Japanese in order to secure loans to fund their military campaigns again the south.\n\nOn 29 April, the German delegation under the leadership of the Foreign Minister Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau arrived in Versailles. On 7 May, when faced with the conditions dictated by the victors, including the so-called \"War Guilt Clause\", von Brockdorff-Rantzau replied to Clemenceau, Wilson and Lloyd George: \"We know the full brunt of hate that confronts us here. You demand from us to confess we were the only guilty party of war; such a confession in my mouth would be a lie.\" Because Germany was not allowed to take part in the negotiations, the German government issued a protest against what it considered to be unfair demands, and a \"violation of honour\", soon afterwards withdrawing from the proceedings of the peace conference.\n\nGermans of all political shades denounced the treaty—particularly the provision that blamed Germany for starting the war—as an insult to the nation's honor. They referred to the treaty as \"the \"Diktat\"\" since its terms were presented to Germany on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Germany′s first democratically elected head of government, Philipp Scheidemann, resigned rather than sign the treaty. In a passionate speech before the National Assembly on 21 March 1919, he called the treaty a \"murderous plan\" and exclaimed,\n\nAfter Scheidemann′s resignation, a new coalition government was formed under Gustav Bauer. President Friedrich Ebert knew that Germany was in an impossible situation. Although he shared his countrymen's disgust with the treaty, he was sober enough to consider the possibility that the government would not be in a position to reject it. He believed that if Germany refused to sign the treaty, the Allies would invade Germany from the west—and there was no guarantee that the army would be able to make a stand in the event of an invasion. With this in mind, he asked Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg if the army was capable of any meaningful resistance in the event the Allies resumed the war. If there was even the slightest chance that the army could hold out, Ebert intended to recommend against ratifying the treaty. Hindenburg—after prodding from his chief of staff, Wilhelm Groener—concluded the army could not resume the war even on a limited scale. However, rather than inform Ebert himself, he had Groener inform the government that the army would be in an untenable position in the event of renewed hostilities. Upon receiving this, the new government recommended signing the treaty. The National Assembly voted in favour of signing the treaty by 237 to 138, with five abstentions (there were 421 delegates in total). This result was wired to Clemenceau just hours before the deadline. Foreign minister Hermann Müller and colonial minister Johannes Bell travelled to Versailles to sign the treaty on behalf of Germany. The treaty was signed on 28 June 1919 and ratified by the National Assembly on 9 July by a vote of 209 to 116.\nConservatives, nationalists and ex-military leaders condemned the treaty. Politicians of the Weimar Republic who supported the treaty, socialists, communists, and Jews were viewed with suspicion as persons of questionable loyalty. It was rumored that Jews had not supported the war and had played a role in selling Germany out to its enemies. Those who seemed to benefit from a weakened Germany and the newly formed Weimar Republic were regarded as having \"stabbed Germany in the back\". Those who instigated unrest and strikes in the critical military industries on the home front or who opposed German nationalism were seen to have contributed to Germany's defeat. These theories were given credence by the fact that when Germany surrendered in November 1918, its armies were still on French and Belgian territory. Furthermore, on the Eastern Front, Germany had already won the war against Russia and concluded the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. In the West, Germany had seemed to have come close to winning the war with the Spring Offensive earlier in 1918. Its failure was blamed on strikes in the arms industry at a critical moment of the offensive, leaving soldiers with an inadequate supply of materiel. The strikes were regarded by nationalists as having been instigated by traitors, with the Jews taking most of the blame.\n\nOn 5 May 1921, the reparation Commission established the London Schedule of Payments and a final reparation sum of gold marks to be demanded of all the Central Powers. This was the public assessment of what the Central Powers combined could pay, and was also a compromise between Belgian, British, and French demands and assessments. Furthermore, the Commission recognized that the Central Powers could pay little and that the burden would fall upon Germany. As a result the sum was split into different categories, of which Germany was only required to pay gold marks ; this being the genuine assessment of the Commission on what Germany could pay, and allowed the Allied powers to save face with the public by presenting a higher figure. Furthermore, payments made between 1919 and 1921 were taken into account reducing the sum to 41 billion gold marks.\n\nIn order to meet this sum, Germany could pay in case or kind: coal, timber, chemical dyes, pharmaceuticals, livestock, agricultural machines, construction materials, and factory machinery. Germany's assistance with the restoration of the university library of Louvain, which was destroyed by the Germans on 25 August 1914, was also credited towards the sum. Territorial changes imposed by the treaty were also factored in. The payment schedule required within twenty-five days and then annually, plus 26 per cent of the value of German exports. The German Government was to issue bonds at five per cent interest and set up a sinking fund of one per cent to support the payment of reparations.\n\nIn February and March 1920, the Schleswig Plebiscites were held. The people of Schleswig were presented with only two choices: Danish or German sovereignty. The northern Danish-speaking area voted for Denmark while the southern German-speaking area voted for Germany, resulting in the province being partitioned. The East Prussia plebiscite was held on 11 July 1920. There was a out with the population wishing to remain with Germany. Further plebiscites were held in Eupen, Malmedy, and Prussian Moresnet. On 20 September 1920, the League of Nations allotted these territories to Belgium. These latter plebiscites were followed by a boundary commission in 1922, followed by the new Belgian-German border being recognized by the German Government on 15 December 1923. The transfer of the Hultschin area, of Silesia, to Czechoslovakia was completed on 3 February 1921.\n\nFollowing the implementation of the treaty, Upper Silesia was initially governed by Britain, France, and Italy. Between 1919–1921, three major outbreaks of violence took place between German and Polish civilians, resulting in German and Polish military forces also becoming involved. In March 1921, the Inter-Allied Commission held the Upper Silesia plebiscite, which was peaceful despite the previous violence. The plebiscite resulted in the population voting for the province to remain part of Germany. Following the vote, the League of Nations debated the future of the province. In 1922, Upper Silesia was partitioned: Oppeln, in the north-west, remained with Germany while Silesia Province, in the south-east, was transferred to Poland.\n\nMemel remained under the authority of the League of Nations, with a French military garrison, until January 1923. On 9 January 1923, Lithuanian forces invaded the territory during the Klaipėda Revolt. The French garrison withdrew, and in February the Allies agreed to attach Memel as an \"autonomous territory\" to Lithuania. On 8 May 1924, after negotiations between the Lithuanian Government and the Conference of Ambassadors and action by the League of Nations, the annexation of Memel was ratified. Lithuania accepted the Memel Statute, a power-sharing arrangement to protect non-Lithuanians in the territory and its autonomous status while responsibility for the territory remained with the great powers. The League of Nations mediated between the Germans and Lithuanians on a local level, helping the power-sharing arrangement last until 1939.\n\nOn 13 January 1935, 15 years after the Saar Basin had been placed under the protection of the League of Nations, a plebiscite was held to determine the future of the area. were cast, with ( the ballot) in favour of union with Germany; were cast for the status quo, and for union with France. The region returned to German sovereignty on 1 March 1935. When the result was announced including from Germany fled to France.\n\nIn late 1918, American, Belgian, British, and French troops entered the Rhineland to enforce the armistice. Prior to the treaty, the occupation force stood at roughly 740,000 men. Following the signing of the peace treaty, the numbers drastically decreased and by 1926 the occupation force numbered only 76,000 men. As part of the 1929 negotiations that would become the Young Plan, Stresemann and Aristide Briand negotiated the early withdrawal of Allied forces from the Rhineland. On 30 June 1930, after speeches and the lowering of flags, the last troops of the Anglo-French-Belgian occupation force withdrew from Germany.\n\nBelgium maintained an occupation force of roughly 10,000 troops throughout the initial years. This figure fell to 7,102 by 1926, and continued to fall as a result of diplomatic developments.\n\nThe British Second Army, with some 275,000 veteran soldiers, entered Germany in late 1918. In March 1919, this force became the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). The total number of troops committed to the occupation rapidly dwindled as veteran soldiers were demobilized, and were replaced by inexperienced men who had finished basic training following the cessation of hostilities. By 1920, the BAOR consisted of only 40,594 men and the following year had been further reduced to 12,421. The size of the BAOR fluctuated over the following years, but never rose above 9,000 men. The British did not adhere to all obligated territorial withdrawals as dictated by Versailles, on account of Germany not meeting her own treaty obligations. A complete withdrawal was considered, but rejected in order to maintain a presence to continue acting as a check on French ambitions and prevent the establishment of an autonomous Rhineland Republic.\n\nThe French Army of the Rhine was initially 250,000 men strong, including at a peak 40,000 African colonial troops (\"Troupes coloniales\"). By 1923, the French occupation force had decreased to roughly 130,000 men, including 27,126 African troops. The troop numbers peaked again at 250,000 during the occupation of the Ruhr, before decreasing to 60,000 men by 1926. Germans viewed the use of French colonial troops as a deliberate act of humiliation, and used their presence to create a propaganda campaign dubbed the Black shame. This campaign lasted throughout the 1920s and 30s, although peaked in 1920 and 1921. For example, a 1921 German Government memo detailed 300 acts of violence from colonial troops, which included 65 murders and 170 sexual offenses. Historical consensus is that the charges were exaggerated for political and propaganda purposes, and that the colonial troops behaved far better than their white counterparts. An estimated 500–800 Rhineland Bastards were born as a result of fraternization between colonial troops and German women, and whom would latter be persecuted.\n\nThe United States Third Army entered Germany with . In June 1919, the Third Army demobilized and by 1920 the US occupation force had been reduced to . Wilson further reduced the garrison to , prior to the inauguration of Warren G. Harding in 1921. On 7 January 1923, after the Franco–Belgian occupation of the Ruhr, the US senate legislated the withdrawal of the remaining force. On 24 January, the American garrison started their withdrawal from the Rhineland, with the final troops leaving in early February.\n\nThe German economy was so weak that only a small percentage of reparations was paid in hard currency. Nonetheless, even the payment of this small percentage of the original reparations (132 billion gold marks) still placed a significant burden on the German economy. Although the causes of the devastating post-war hyperinflation are complex and disputed, Germans blamed the near-collapse of their economy on the treaty, and some economists estimated that the reparations accounted for as much as one-third of the hyper-inflation.\n\nIn March 1921, French and Belgian troops occupied Duisburg, which formed part of the demilitarized Rhineland, according to the Treaty of Versailles. In January 1923, French and Belgian forces occupied the rest of the Ruhr area as a reprisal after Germany failed to fulfill reparation payments demanded by the Versailles Treaty. The German government answered with \"passive resistance\", which meant that coal miners and railway workers refused to obey any instructions by the occupation forces. Production and transportation came to a standstill, but the financial consequences contributed to German hyperinflation and completely ruined public finances in Germany. Consequently, passive resistance was called off in late 1923. The end of passive resistance in the Ruhr allowed Germany to undertake a currency reform and to negotiate the Dawes Plan, which led to the withdrawal of French and Belgian troops from the Ruhr Area in 1925.\n\nIn 1920, the head of the \"Reichswehr\" Hans von Seeckt clandestinely re-established the General Staff, by expanding the \"Truppenamt\" (Troop Office); purportedly a human resources section of the army. In March, German troops entered the Rhineland under the guise of attempting to quell possible unrest by communists and in doing so violated the demilitarized zone. In response, French troops advanced further into Germany until the German troops withdrew.\n\nGerman officials conspired systematically to evade the clauses of the treaty, by failing to meet disarmament deadlines, refusing Allied officials access to military facilities, and maintaining and hiding weapon production. As the treaty did not ban German companies from producing war material outside of Germany, companies moved to the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Sweden. Bofors was bought by Krupp, and in 1921 German troops were sent to Sweden to test weapons. The establishment of diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, via the Genoa Conference and Treaty of Rapallo, was also used to circumvent the Treaty of Versailles. Publicly, these diplomatic exchanges were largely in regards to trade and future economic cooperation. However, secret military clauses were included that allowed for Germany to develop weapons inside the Soviet Union. Furthermore, it allowed for Germany to establish three training areas for aviation, chemical and tank warfare. In 1923, the British newspaper The Times made several claims about the state of the German Armed Forces: that it had equipment for , was transferring army staff to civilian positions in order to obscure their real duties, and warned of the militarization of the German police force by the exploitation the Krümper system.\n\nThe Weimar Government also funded domestic rearmament programs, which were covertly funded with the money camouflaged in \"X-budgets\", worth up to an additional the disclosed military budget. By 1925, German companies had begun to design tanks and modern artillery. During the year, over half of Chinese arms imports were German and worth \"Reichsmarks.\" In January 1927, following the withdrawal of the Allied disarmament committee, Krupps ramped up production of armor plate and artillery. Production increased so that by 1937, military exports had increased to \"Reichsmarks\". Production was not the only violation: \"Volunteers\" were rapidly passed through the army to make a pool of trained reserves, and paramilitary organizations were encouraged with the illegally militarized police. Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) were not limited by the treaty, thus this loophole was exploited and as such the number of NCOs were vastly in excess to the number needed by the \"Reichswehr\".\n\nIn December 1931, the \"Reichswehr\" finalized a second rearmament plan that called for \"Reichsmarks\" to be spent over the following five years: this program sought to provide Germany the capability of creating and supplying a defensive force of 21 divisions supported by aircraft, artillery, and tanks. This coincided with a \"Reichsmark\" programme that planned for additional industrial infrastructure that would be able to permanently maintain this force. As these programs did not require an expansion of the military, they were nominally legal. On 7 November 1932, the Reich Minister of Defense Kurt von Schleicher authorized the illegal \"Umbau\" Plan for a standing army of 21 divisions based on soldiers and a large militia. Later in the year at the World Disarmament Conference, Germany withdrew to force France and the United Kingdom to accept German equality of status. The United Kingdom attempted to get Germany to return with the promise of all nations maintaining an equality in armaments and security. The British later proposed and agreed to an increase in the \"Reichswehr\" to men, and for Germany to have an air force half the size of the French. It was also negotiated for the French Army to be reduced. \n\nIn October 1933, following the rise of Adolf Hitler and the founding of Nazi regime, Germany withdrew from League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference. In March 1935, Germany reintroduced conscription followed by an open rearmament programme, the official unveiling of the Luftwaffe (air force), and signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement that allowed a surface fleet the size of the Royal Navy. The resulting rearmament programs was allotted \"Reichsmarks\" over an eight year period.\n\nOn 7 March 1936, German troops entered and remilitarized the Rhineland. On 12 March 1938, following German pressure to the collapse the Austrian Government, German troops crossed into Austria and the following day Hitler announced the Anschluss: the annexation of Austria by Germany. The following year, on 23 March 1939, Germany annexed Memel from Lithuania.\n\nAccording to David Stevenson, since the opening of French archives, most commentators have remarked on French restraint and reasonableness at the conference, though Stevenson notes that \"[t]he jury is still out\", and that \"there have been signs that the pendulum of judgement is swinging back the other way.\"\n\nIn his book \"The Economic Consequences of the Peace\", John Maynard Keynes referred to the Treaty of Versailles as a \"Carthaginian peace\", a misguided attempt to destroy Germany on behalf of French revanchism, rather than to follow the fairer principles for a lasting peace set out in President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, which Germany had accepted at the armistice. He stated: \"I believe that the campaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was one of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our statesmen have ever been responsible.\" Keynes had been the principal representative of the British Treasury at the Paris Peace Conference, and used in his passionate book arguments that he and others (including some US officials) had used at Paris. He believed the sums being asked of Germany in reparations were many times more than it was possible for Germany to pay, and that these would produce drastic instability.\n\nFrench economist Étienne Mantoux disputed that analysis. During the 1940s, Mantoux wrote a posthumously published book titled \"The Carthaginian Peace, or the Economic Consequences of Mr. Keynes\" in an attempt to rebut Keynes' claims. More recently economists have argued that the restriction of Germany to a small army saved it so much money it could afford the reparations payments.\n\nIt has been argued (for instance by historian Gerhard Weinberg in his book \"A World At Arms\") that the treaty was in fact quite advantageous to Germany. The Bismarckian Reich was maintained as a political unit instead of being broken up, and Germany largely escaped post-war military occupation (in contrast to the situation following World War II). In a 1995 essay, Weinberg noted that with the disappearance of Austria-Hungary and with Russia withdrawn from Europe, that Germany was now the dominant power in Eastern Europe.\n\nThe British military historian Correlli Barnett claimed that the Treaty of Versailles was \"extremely lenient in comparison with the peace terms that Germany herself, when she was expecting to win the war, had had in mind to impose on the Allies\". Furthermore, he claimed, it was \"hardly a slap on the wrist\" when contrasted with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that Germany had imposed on a defeated Russia in March 1918, which had taken away a third of Russia's population (albeit of non-Russian ethnicity), one-half of Russia's industrial undertakings and nine-tenths of Russia's coal mines, coupled with an indemnity of six billion marks. Eventually, even under the \"cruel\" terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany′s economy had been restored to its pre-war status.\n\nBarnett also claims that, in strategic terms, Germany was in fact in a superior position following the Treaty than she had been in 1914. Germany′s eastern frontiers faced Russia and Austria, who had both in the past balanced German power. Barnett asserts that its post-war eastern borders were safer, because the former Austrian Empire fractured after the war into smaller, weaker states, Russia was wracked by revolution and civil war, and the newly restored Poland was no match for even a defeated Germany. In the West, Germany was balanced only by France and Belgium, both of which were smaller in population and less economically vibrant than Germany. Barnett concludes by saying that instead of weakening Germany, the treaty \"much enhanced\" German power. Britain and France should have (according to Barnett) \"divided and permanently weakened\" Germany by undoing Bismarck's work and partitioning Germany into smaller, weaker states so it could never have disrupted the peace of Europe again. By failing to do this and therefore not solving the problem of German power and restoring the equilibrium of Europe, Britain \"had failed in her main purpose in taking part in the Great War\".\n\nThe British historian of modern Germany, Richard J. Evans, wrote that during the war the German right was committed to an annexationist program which aimed at Germany annexing most of Europe and Africa. Consequently, any peace treaty that did not leave Germany as the conqueror would be unacceptable to them. Short of allowing Germany to keep all the conquests of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Evans argued that there was nothing that could have been done to persuade the German right to accept Versailles. Evans further noted that the parties of the Weimar Coalition, namely the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), the social liberal German Democratic Party (DDP) and the Christian democratic Centre Party, were all equally opposed to Versailles, and it is false to claim as some historians have that opposition to Versailles also equalled opposition to the Weimar Republic. Finally, Evans argued that it is untrue that Versailles caused the premature end of the Republic, instead contending that it was the Great Depression of the early 1930s that put an end to German democracy. He also argued that Versailles was not the \"main cause\" of National Socialism and the German economy was \"only marginally influenced by the impact of reparations\".\n\nEwa Thompson points out that the treaty allowed numerous nations in Central and Eastern Europe to liberate themselves from oppressive German rule, a fact that is often neglected by Western historiography, more interested in understanding the German point of view. In nations that found themselves free as the result of the treaty—such as Poles or Czechs—it is seen as a symbol of recognition of wrongs committed against small nations by their much larger aggressive neighbours.\n\nRegardless of modern strategic or economic analysis, resentment caused by the treaty sowed fertile psychological ground for the eventual rise of the Nazi Party. The German historian Detlev Peukert wrote that Versailles was far from the impossible peace that most Germans claimed it was during the interwar period, and though not without flaws was actually quite reasonable to Germany. Rather, Peukert argued that it was widely believed in Germany that Versailles was a totally unreasonable treaty, and it was this \"perception\" rather than the \"reality\" of the Versailles treaty that mattered. Peukert noted that because of the \"millenarian hopes\" created in Germany during World War I when for a time it appeared that Germany was on the verge of conquering all of Europe, any peace treaty the Allies of World War I imposed on the defeated \"German Reich\" were bound to create a nationalist backlash, and there was nothing the Allies could have done to avoid that backlash. Having noted that much, Peukert commented that the policy of rapprochement with the Western powers that Gustav Stresemann carried out between 1923 and 1929 were constructive policies that might have allowed Germany to play a more positive role in Europe, and that it was not true that German democracy was doomed to die in 1919 because of Versailles. Finally, Peukert argued that it was the Great Depression and the turn to a nationalist policy of autarky within Germany at the same time that finished off the Weimar Republic, not the Treaty of Versailles.\n\nFrench historian Raymond Cartier states that millions of Germans in the Sudetenland and in Posen-West Prussia were placed under foreign rule in a hostile environment, where harassment and violation of rights by authorities are documented. Cartier asserts that, out of 1,058,000 Germans in Posen-West Prussia in 1921, 758,867 fled their homelands within five years due to Polish harassment. In 1926, the Polish Ministry of the Interior estimated the remaining number of Germans at fewer than 300,000. These sharpening ethnic conflicts would lead to public demands to reattach the annexed territory in 1938 and become a pretext for Hitler′s annexations of Czechoslovakia and parts of Poland.\n\nThe plebiscites initiated due to the treaty have drawn much comment. Historian Robert Peckham wrote that the issue of Schleswig \"was premised on a gross simplification of the region's history. ... Versailles ignored any possibility of there being a third way: the kind of compact represented by the Swiss Federation; a bilingual or even trilingual Schleswig-Holsteinian state\" or other options such as \"a Schleswigian state in a loose confederation with Denmark or Germany, or an autonomous region under the protection of the League of Nations.\" In regards to the East Prussia plebiscite, historian Richard Blanke wrote that \"no other contested ethnic group has ever, under un-coerced conditions, issued so one-sided a statement of its national preference\". Richard Debo wrote \"both Berlin and Warsaw believed the Soviet invasion of Poland had influenced the East Prussian plebiscites. Poland appeared so close to collapse that even Polish voters had cast their ballots for Germany\".\n\nIn regards to the Silesian plebiscite, Blanke observed \"given that the electorate was at least 60% Polish-speaking, this means that about one 'Pole' in three voted for Germany\" and \"most Polish observers and historians\" have concluded that the outcome of plebiscite was due to \"unfair German advantages of incumbency and socio-economic position\". Blanke alleged \"coercion of various kinds even in the face of an allied occupation regime\" occurred, and that Germany granted votes to those \"who had been born in Upper Silesia but no longer resided there\". Blanke concluded that despite these protests \"there is plenty of other evidence, including Reichstag election results both before and after 1921 and the large-scale emigration of Polish-speaking Upper Silesians to Germany after 1945, that their identification with Germany in 1921 was neither exceptional nor temporary\" and \"here was a large population of Germans and Poles—not coincidentally, of the same Catholic religion—that not only shared the same living space but also came in many cases to see themselves as members of the same national community\". Prince Eustachy Sapieha, the Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, alleged that Soviet Russia \"appeared to be intentionally delaying negotiations\" to end the Polish-Soviet War \"with the object of influencing the Upper Silesian plebiscite\". Once the region was partitioned, both \"Germany and Poland attempted to 'cleanse' their shares of Upper Silesia\" via oppression resulting in Germans migrating to Germany and Poles migrating to Poland. Despite the oppression and migration, Opole Silesia \"remained ethnically mixed.\"\n\nFrank Russell wrote that, in regards to the Saar plebiscite, the inhabitants \"were not terrorized at the polls\" and the \"totalitarian [Nazi] German regime was not distasteful to most of the Saar inhabitants and that they preferred it even to an efficient, economical, and benevolent international rule.\" When the outcome of the vote became known, 4,100 (including 800 refugees who had previously fled Germany) residents fled over the border into France.\n\nDuring the formulation of the treaty, the British wanted Germany to abolish conscription and be allowed to maintain volunteer Army. The French wanted Germany to maintain a conscript army of up to 200,000 men in order to justify their own maintenance of a similar force. Thus the treaty's allowance of 100,000 volunteers was a compromise between the British and French positions. Germany, on the other hand, saw the terms as leaving them defenseless against any potential enemy. Bernadotte Everly Schmitt wrote that \"there is no reason to believe that the Allied governments were insincere when they stated at the beginning of Part V of the Treaty ... that in order to facilitate a general reduction of the armament of all nations, Germany was to be required to disarm first.\" A lack of American ratification of the treaty or joining the League of Nations left France unwilling to disarm, which resulted in a German unwillingness to rearm. Schmitt argued \"had the four Allies remained united, they could have forced Germany really to disarm, and the German will and capacity to resist other provisions of the treaty would have correspondingly diminished.\" \n\nMax Hantke and Mark Spoerer wrote \"military and economic historians [have] found that the German military only insignificantly exceeded the limits\" of the treaty prior to 1933. Adam Tooze concurred, and wrote \"To put this in perspective, annual military spending by the Weimar Republic was counted not in the billions but in the hundreds of millions of \"Reichsmarks\"\"; for example, the Weimar Republic's 1931 program of \"Reichsmarks\" over five years compared to the Nazi Government's 1933 plan to spend \"Reichsmarks\" per year. P.M.H. Bell argued that the British Government was aware of latter Weimar rearming, and lent public respectability to the German efforts by not opposing them. Norman Davies wrote that \"a curious oversight\" of the military restrictions were that they \"did not include rockets in its list of prohibited weapons\", which provided Wernher von Braun an area to research within eventually resulting in \"his break [that] came in 1943\" leading to the development of the V-2 rocket.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12228666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12228666", "title": "Vlaamse Opera", "text": "Vlaamse Opera\n\nThe Vlaamse Opera (Flemish Opera) is an opera company in Belgium directed by Aviel Cahn which operates in two different opera houses in two Flemish cities, the Vlaamse Opera Antwerpen at Van Ertbornstraat 8 and the Vlaamse Opera Ghent at Schouwburgstraat 3. However, the company shares one orchestra, choir, technical team, etc. The organization is mainly financed by the Flemish government and the city councils of Antwerp and Ghent.\n\nIn its current form, the company was created in 1996 as a successor to the Flemish Opera Foundation (\"Vlaamse Opera Stichting,\" which had existed since 1988), and the Opera for Flanders (\"Opera voor Vlaanderen,\" which had existed since 1981). Both former institutions were similar fusions between the former opera houses of Antwerp and Ghent. Since the fusion in 1981, the company has been giving performances in two different historic theatres.\n\nThe first public opera performances in Antwerp date back to 1661. Performances took place on the stage of the \"Schouwburgh van de Oude Voetboog\" (Theatre of the Guild of Crossbowmen) at the Grote Markt. The theatre gradually lost its popular Flemish character as French artists were engaged and the performances were no longer performed in the local (Dutch) language, but in French, the adopted language of the Flemish elite.\n\nIn 1709 a new theatre was installed in the \"Tapissierspand\", a former covered market for tapestry where alternately Italian and French operas were performed. The new auditorium burnt down in 1746 and was replaced by a new \"Grand Théâtre\" which opened in 1753. During the period of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the theatre was promoted to \"Théâtre Royal\". At that time the old theatre was already in decay and it became too small to house the growing public. Plans were made to tear down the old building and to replace it by a new and more prestigious building. In 1829 the last performance was given in the \"Tappisierspand\".\n\nThe new theatre opened after the Belgian revolution in 1834. (This building is now known as the \"Bourlaschouwburg\" and is used today for regular theatre performances.) The French repertoire (and, to a lesser extent, the Italian repertoire in French translation) continued to dominate.\n\nThe opera house closed in 2005 for a two-year renovation of the entire building. In November 2007, exactly 100 years after the grand opening in 1907, the opera opened again for a new season. New office buildings were constructed, the main auditorium was updated with new seating, a new heating system, and the walls were painted in a new fresh green colour. Behind the scenes all the offices are combined together in the new 'Office territory' behind and next to the stage. Major improvements are the leveling of the stage floor (which had a rake of 4° due to 19th century practice), a big new side stage, updated lighting and mechanical structures.\n\nBecause of budget limitations (the first budget estimate for the entire renovation was 33 million euro but, after certain non critical phases were removed from the master plan, the total budget was 24 million euros), only the most urgent tasks were executed. Therefore, not all the ornaments where cleaned and the public hallways are painted white. It is expected that when new funds are available, the golden ornaments and hallways will be updated.\n\n\n\n\n"}
