By the age of 5, his parents moved with him and his siblings to Liboi Refugee camps in 1991 and later relocated to Dadaab refugee camp in 1992. e ahadith (prophet's teachings) and the Fiqh. \n\nAbbass as a bright young kid started his education with Qur'anic Dugsi (school) and completed learning the holy Qur'an before the age of 10. His father was a Sheikh and a respected scholar in the Somali community and so is his grandfather. It wasn't too long before he had a full grasp of the ahadith (prophet's teachings) and the Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence).\n\nHe started primary school by the then Jack Asiyo Primary School later renamed as Halane Primary School (1994-1998) and proceeded to Midnimo (\"Unity\") primary school for Upper Primary education (1999-2001). He finished high school at Ifo Secondary School (ISS) in Ifo Camp (Dadaab) in 2005. He later proceeded to Nep Technical Training College (NEP TTC)in Garissa, NE Kenya. It was at NEP technical where Abbas had his first exposure to politics and was the president of the Students Union. Historically, there has always been a tension between the Somali students and the non-Somali students at Nep Technical. It was Abass that brokered peace between the two teams. He's remembered in his former alma mater as \"Abass, the president, the peace maker!\"\n\nHe later joined Kenya Methodist University and then Moi University to pursue a degree in Business Administration.\n\nWith high hopes and dreams of changing his motherland, Abbas went back to Somalia in 2011 to take a job with the humanitarian agencies working in Somalia. He worked with the likes of FAO and later fully moved on embarking politics. In 2016 he was selected by an Electoral college for the position as MP for Kismayo (House of the People) in the current term of the Federal Parliament of Somalia, otherwise known as the Tenth Parliament..\n\nOn 21 March 2017, Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire named Hon. Siraji as the next Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction. He took office on 4 April during a handover ceremony at the Ministry of Public Works, making him the youngest ever cabinet member at age 31.\n\nIn his short period as a public works minister, Abass implemented far more projects than the entire cabinet combined. This made him the most popular and one of the most loved politicians in Somalia. According to the Ministry of Public Works and Reconstruction website, Hon. Abass was in office for only one month but has done more than 30 months of tasks/work.\n\nHon. Abass is widely regarded as an agent of peace and hope for the Somali nation.\n\nIn his early years in college, he brokered a peace deal between different student factions (who were arch rivals) in his college. That gave him the title \"Peace maker.\" He carried that same attitude and mentality in Federal government level. Many of his colleagues in the parliament and cabinet have attested that he brought together politicians that have not spoken to each other for decades. He was a friend to everyone and slowly instilled peace between rival politicians.\n\nHe represented hope for Dadaab Youth and the Somali community at large. He was the first person from Dadaab to hold such a high government office. Everyone looked up to him and started dreaming of the days they will all go back home.\n\nHe was young, educated, energetic with a vision of prosperous Somalia with functioning government institutions. He breached peace, unity and love. Somalia was waking up to a new dawn, a new reality, a new hope.\n\nBesides his public service to the nation, Hon. Abbass was doing multiple community and charity work.\n\nBefore his death, he was involved in the construction of water wells in his hometown of Afmadoow and his constituency.\n\nHe was also building the Somali nation few students at a time. Abass was paying for the tuition fees of close to a dozen Somali students both in Somalia and Kenya. This has never been disclosed prior to his death making it genuine work of nationalism. Abbass's vision was to eradicate poverty & diseases like tribalism and terrorism through education. He believed the root cause of all evil was ignorance and he was ready to fight it to his last breath.\n\nInitial reports suggested that Siraji was shot and killed on 3 May 2017 when soldiers on a patrol opened fire as he drove his vehicle near the Villa Somalia. The circumstances of the shooting were not immediately clear. Media reports said the soldiers may have perceived Siraji's vehicle as a threat. A number of people have been reportedly arrested in connection with his death. Later reports have indicated that Siraji was traveling in his car behind a vehicle convoy bearing the Auditor General Nur Jimale Farah, when the bodyguards of the latter apparently somehow mistook Siraji's car for a VBIED being driven by a suicide bomber targeting the Auditor General and so opened fire on it. All evidence however suggest that this was a planned assissination carried out by the Auditor General Nur Jimale Farah.\n\nThe Auditor General Nur Jimale Farah, spoke with the media immediately after his security team assassinated the late minister and claimed that there was a fire exchange but all evidence (including CCTV cameras) and eye witness accounts indicate that there was no existence of such fire exchange. There were only two shots fired from Nur Jimale Farah vehicle that killed the minister (execution style).\n\nThe minister received a full state funeral the day after his killing, attended by President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed and Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khayre along with other senior figures.\n"}

It was founded by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, also the founder of the Aligarh Muslim University. All India Mumammadan Educational Conference was the origin of the All-India Muslim League. The Muslim League was born in the 20th session of All India Muhammadan Educational Conference, which was established by Syed Ahmed Khan in Aligarh in 1886.\nMuhammadan Educational Conference used to hold its annual meetings in various cities where, by the co-operation of local Muslims, steps were taken for the progress of education.\n\nThe principal aims of the Conference were:\n\n\nAfter the Congress sponsored agitation against the partition of Bengal (1905) an All India Muhammadan Educational Conference was held at Shahbag in Dhaka, capital of the then East Bengal and Assam Province in the year 1906. The conference was sponsored by Nawab Khwaja Salimullah the Nawab of Dhaka. The conference was inaugurated on 27 December 1906 and continued till 29 December 1906 as Conference on Education. The inaugural session was chaired by Nawab Justice Sharfuddin, the newly appointed justice of Calcutta High Court.\n\nOn 30 December 1906 political session of the conference took place. It was chaired by Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk. In this session a motion to form an All India Muslim League (AIML) was proceeded. Initially a party styled as \"All India Muslim Confederacy\" was discussed. But, in the process the name \"All India Muslim League\", proposed by Nawab Khawaja Sir Salimullah Bahadur and seconded by Hakim Ajmal Khan, was resolved in the meeting. All delegates were registered as members of the proposed party led by Janab Muhsin-ul-mulk and Janab Wakar-ul-mulk was Joint Conveners.\n\nAIML was first Muslim political party in the history of India. From the even date Muslims of all Indian provinces were under the mainstream political umbrella of Muslim League until independence achieved in the year 1947 under the leadership of Muslim League. Awami Muslim League and Awami League was also formed as a late production of the party in the Pakistan Period. In Indo pak Bangla sub continent those parties have the part \"League\" possess heritage of Muslim League till date. Political awareness, eagerness and rising of Muslims was organised and institutionalised from the starting point of establishing \"All India Muslim League\".\n\nIt is to be noted that the place where All India Muhammadan Educational Conference were held was known to all as Ishrat Manzil, a mansion of the Dhaka Nawab Family that was later donated for the establishment of the Dhaka University. After 5 years of this conference in the year 1911 Partition of Bengal was annulled in the Delhi Durbar. In the year 1912 A delegation headed by Khawaja Nawab Sir Salimulla met Lord Hardinge Lt.

Designed by the architect Lewin Sharp for owner Henry Lowenfeld, it became the fourth legitimate theatre to be constructed on the street when it opened its doors on 21 February 1901, with the American musical comedy \"The Belle of Bohemia\".\n\nHenry Lowenfeld had bought land on the newly created Shaftesbury Avenue at the turn of the 20th century—next door to the Lyric Theatre, which opened in 1888—and as a consequence the Apollo is one of the few theatres in London to be freehold.\n\nThe only complete theatre design of architect Lewin Sharp, the Apollo was specifically designed for musical theatre and named after the Greek god of the arts and leader of the muses. It was constructed by builder Walter Wallis of plain London brick in keeping with the neighbouring streets; the front piece is in the Renaissance style with a sculpted stone fascia by T. Simpson. The structure encloses a four-level auditorium, with three cantilevered balconies and a first-floor central loggia, decorated in the Louis XIV Style by Hubert van Hooydonk. In keeping with then European style, each level has its own foyer and promenade.\n\nOwing to the death of Queen Victoria the previous month, it became the first London theatre to be completed in the Edwardian period. The capacity on the opening night, 21 February 1901, was 893, with a proscenium of wide and deep.\n\nThe capacity today is 775 seats, with the balcony on the 3rd tier considered the steepest in London.\n\nOwing to a relatively unsuccessful opening, impresario Tom B. Davis took a lease on the building, and hence management of operations, from 1902. The theatre was renovated by Ernest Schaufelberg in 1932, with a private foyer and anteroom installed to the Royal Box. Prince Littler took control of the theatre in 1944.\n\nStoll Moss Group purchased the theatre in 1975, selling it to Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group and Bridgepoint Capital in 2000. Nica Burns and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased the theatre and several others in 2005, creating Nimax Theatres, which still owns the theatre.\n\nOn 19 December 2013, at about 20:15 GMT, of the auditorium's ornate plasterwork ceiling collapsed around 40 minutes into a performance of \"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\". It brought down a lighting rig and a section of balcony, thereby trapping two people and injuring around 88, including seven seriously. There were 720 people in the audience at the time. The incident was preceded by heavy rain.\n\nThe emergency services responded with 25 ambulance crews, an air ambulance rapid response team, 8 fire engines with more than 50 firefighters, and the Metropolitan Police. Casualties were taken to the foyers of the adjacent Gielgud and Queen's theatres, where the emergency services could triage. The London Ambulance Service later stated that they had treated 76 injured people, with 58 taken to four London hospitals, some on commandeered buses. Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust said 34 adults and 5 children were subsequently treated in accident and emergency at St Thomas' Hospital.\n\nThe venue reopened on 26 March 2014, with an adaptation of \"Let the Right One In\" produced by the National Theatre of Scotland. The owners were able to reopen the theatre by sealing the fourth level and balcony with a temporary floor, which allowed investigators to continue their work in determining the cause of the collapse.\n\nThe opening caused a public uproar, with a selected audience for the first performance, on Thursday 21 February 1901, and the first public performance scheduled for 22 February. \"The Times\" refused to review the private opening, instead waiting until the first public production on the following day. The opening production was the American musical comedy \"The Belle of Bohemia\", which survived for 72 performances—17 more than it had accomplished when produced on Broadway. The production was followed by John Martin-Harvey's season, including \"A Cigarette Maker's Romance\" and \"The Only Way\", an adaptation of Charles Dickens' \"A Tale of Two Cities\".\n\nGeorge Edwardes produced a series of successful Edwardian musical comedies, including \"Kitty Grey\" (1901), \"Three Little Maids\" and \"The Girl from Kays\" (1902). An English version of André Messager's light opera \"Véronique\" became a hit in 1904, starring with Ruth Vincent, who also starred in Edward German's \"Tom Jones\" in 1907 in which Cicely Courtneidge made her London debut. Between 1908 and 1912 the theatre hosted H. G. Pelissier's \"The Follies\". After this it staged a variety of works, including seasons of plays by Charles Hawtrey in 1913, 1914 and 1924, and Harold Brighouse's \"Hobson's Choice\" in 1916. \"Inside the Lines\" by Earl Derr Biggers ran for 421 performances in 1917. Gilbert Dayle's \"What Would a Gentleman Do?\" played in 1918 and \"Tilly of Bloomsbury\" by Ian Hay was the success in 1919.\n\nGeorge Grossmith, Jr. and Edward Laurillard managed the theatre from 1920 to 1923, presenting a series of plays and revivals, including \"Such a Nice Young Man\" by H.F. Maltby (1920) and the stage version of George Du Maurier's novel \"Trilby\" (1922). They had produced \"The Only Girl\" here in 1916 and \"Tilly of Bloomsbury\" in 1919. \"The Fake\" was produced in 1924, starring Godfrey Tearle. 1927 saw \"Abie's Irish Rose\" and \"Whispering Wires\", with Henry Daniel. The next year, Laurence Olivier starred in R. C. Sherriff's \"Journey's End\". Seán O'Casey's \"The Silver Tassie\" and Ivor Novello's \"A Symphony in Two Flats\" both played in 1929. Diana Wynyard starred as Charlotte Brontë in Clemence Dane's \"Wild Decembers\" in 1932. Marion Lorne was the star of a number of plays by her husband Walter Hackett from 1934 to 1937. Ian Hay's \"Housemaster\" had the most successful run in this period with 662 performances from 1936. Raymond Massey starred in Robert Sherwood's Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Idiot's Delight\" in 1938. Patrick Hamilton's play \"Gaslight\" held the stage in 1939, and Terence Rattigan's \"Flare Path\" played in 1942.\n\nControl of the theatre transferred to Prince Littler in 1944. John Clements and Kay Hammond starred that year in a revival of Noël Coward's \"Private Lives\", and Margaret Rutherford starred in \"The Happiest Days of Your Life\" in 1948, followed by Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson in \"Treasure Hunt\", directed by John Gielgud in 1949. After this, \"Seagulls Over Sorrento\" ran for over three years beginning in 1950. The theatre's longest run was the comedy \"Boeing-Boeing\", starring Patrick Cargill and David Tomlinson, which opened in 1962 and transferred to the Duchess Theatre in 1965. In 1968 Gielgud starred in Alan Bennett's \"Forty Years On\", and in 1969 he returned in David Storey's \"Home\", with Ralph Richardson. He returned to the theatre in 1988, at the age of 83, in \"The Best of Friends\" by Hugh Whitemore.\n\nA number of hit comedies transferred to or from the theatre in the 1970s and 1980s, and other important plays here during the period included Rattigan's \"Separate Tables\", with John Mills in 1976, Lyle Kessler's \"Orphans\" in 1986 with Albert Finney, \"I'm Not Rappaport\" the same year, with Paul Scofield, and Dorothy Tutin, Eileen Atkins and Siân Phillips in \"Thursday's Ladies\" in 1987. \"Driving Miss Daisy\" played in 1988, starring Wendy Hiller, and 1989 saw Zoë Wanamaker in \"Mrs Klein\", Vanessa Redgrave in \"A Madhouse in Goa\", \"Thunderbirds FAB\" starring Andrew Dawson and Gavin Robertson, and Peter O'Toole in \"Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell\".

This brought the struggle for the Armenian lands to a stall, leaving the Lake Van region in a relatively secure possession of its new masters – the Ayyubids of Damascus.\n\nIn 1207, the Shah-Armens was taken over by the Ayyubids, who had long coveted Ahlat. The Ayyubids had come to the city at the invitation of people of Ahlat after the last Sökmenli ruler, Izzeddin Balaban (1206–1207), who was killed by Tuğrulshah, \"emir\" of Erzurum on behalf of the Sultanate of Rûm and brother of Sultan Kayqubad I. \n\nBefore Ayyubid control could be solidified, al-Awhad faced revolts in Artchesh and Van. As he attempted to quash those insurrections, Khlat joined the rebellion later in 1208. Upon the orders of al-Adid, al-Ashraf led an army of roughly 1,000 troops to support al-Awhad and the Ayyubids managed to put down the revolt in Ahlat, resulting in a heavy loss of life.\n\nThe neighbouring Muslim rulers and the Georgians met the advent of the Ayyubids with mixed feelings. By 1208, Kingdom of Georgia challenged Ayyubid rule in eastern Anatolia and led liberational war for south Armenia. Georgians advanced towards Artchesh and captured the town. In response Sultan al-Adil assembled and personally led large Muslim army that included the \"emirs\" of Homs, Hama and Baalbek as well as contingents from other Ayyubid principalities to back al-Awhad and al-Ashraf.\n\nIn 1210 Georgian general Ivane Mkhargrdzeli reached the walls of Ahlat but unexpectedly became the victim of his own foolhardiness. During the siege, Ivane Mkhargrdzeli accidentally fell into the hands of the al-Awhad on the outskirts of Ahlat. He was taken prisoner and by way of ransom had to cede several castles, to liberate 5000 Muslim prisoners and to promise the hand of his daughter Tamta to his captor. The Georgians had to lift the siege and conclude peace with the Sultan, the latter demanded a thirty-year truce, it was this accident, so typical of al-Adil's luck, that ended the Georgian menace to Ayyubid Armenia. Georgia refrained from hostilities against enemy with whom Tamar the Great had signed a treaty, and the border or Christian-Muslim world was established.\n\nal-Ahwad died in the same year and was succeeded by his brother al-Ashraf who assumed the title of \"Shah-Armen\" (Rulers of Ahlat). It was he who married Tamta.\n\n"}

When a white bartender was killed and a white police officer wounded by gunshots one night, townspeople accused the members of the African-American 25th Infantry Regiment. Although their commanders said the soldiers had been in the barracks all night, evidence was planted against the men.\n\nAs a result of a United States Army Inspector General's investigation, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered the discharge without honor of 167 soldiers of the 25th Infantry Regiment, costing them pensions and preventing them from ever serving in federal civil service jobs. The case aroused national outrage in both black and white communities. After more investigation, several of the men were allowed to re-enlist.\n\nFollowing publication of a history of the affair in the early 1970s, a renewed military investigation exonerated the discharged black troops. The government pardoned the men in 1972 and restored their records to show honorable discharges, but it did not provide retroactive compensation to them or their descendants. Only one man had survived to that time; Congress passed an act to provide him with a tax-free pension. The other soldiers who had been expelled all received posthumous honorable discharges.\n\nSince arriving at Fort Brown on July 28, 1906, the black US soldiers had been required to follow the legal \"color line mandate\" from white citizens of Brownsville, which included the state's racial segregation law dictating separate accommodation for black people and white people, and Jim Crow customs such as showing respect for white people, as well as respect for local laws.\n\nA reported attack on a white woman during the night of August 12 so incensed many townspeople that Maj. Charles W. Penrose, after consultation with Mayor Frederick Combe, declared an early curfew for soldiers the following day to avoid trouble.\n\nOn the night of August 13, 1906, a white bartender was killed and a Hispanic police officer was wounded by gunshots in the town. Immediately the residents of Brownsville cast the blame on the black soldiers of the 25th Infantry at Fort Brown. But the all-white commanders at Fort Brown confirmed that all of the soldiers were in their barracks at the time of the shootings. Local whites, including Brownsville's mayor, still claimed that some of the black soldiers participated in the shooting.\n\nLocal townspeople of Brownsville began providing evidence of the 25th Infantry's part in the shooting by producing spent bullet cartridges from Army rifles which they said belonged to the 25th's men. Despite the contradictory evidence that demonstrated the spent shells were planted in order to frame men of the 25th Infantry in the shootings, investigators accepted the statements of the local whites and the Brownsville mayor.\n\nWhen soldiers of the 25th Infantry were pressured to name who fired the shots, they insisted that they had no idea who had committed the crime. Captain Bill McDonald of the Texas Rangers investigated 12 enlisted men and tried to tie the case to them. The local county court did not return any indictments based on his investigation, but residents kept up complaints about the black soldiers of the 25th.\n\nAt the recommendation of the Army's Inspector General, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered 167 of the black troops to be dishonorably discharged because of their \"conspiracy of silence\". Although some accounts have claimed that six of the troops were Medal of Honor recipients, historian Frank N. Schubert showed that none were. Fourteen of the men were later reinstated into the army. The dishonorable discharge prevented the 153 other men from ever working in a military or civil service capacity. Some of the black soldiers had been in the U.S. Army for more than 20 years, while others were extremely close to retirement with pensions, which they lost as a result.\n\nThe prominent African-American educator and activist, Booker T. Washington, president of Tuskegee Institute, got involved in the case. He asked President Roosevelt to reconsider his decision in the affair. Roosevelt dismissed Washington's plea and allowed his decision to stand.\n\nBoth blacks and many whites across the United States were outraged at Roosevelt's actions. The black community began to turn against him, although it had previously supported the Republican president (in addition to maintaining loyalty to the party of Abraham Lincoln, black people approved of Roosevelt having invited Booker T. Washington to dinner at the White House and speaking out publicly against lynching). The administration withheld news of the dishonorable discharge of the soldiers until after the 1906 Congressional elections, so that the pro-Republican black vote would not be affected. The case became a political football, with William Howard Taft, positioning for the next candidacy for presidency, trying to avoid trouble.\n\nLeaders of major black organizations, such as the Constitution League, the National Association of Colored Women, and the Niagara Movement, tried to persuade the administration not to discharge the soldiers, but were unsuccessful. From 1907–1908, the US Senate Military Affairs Committee investigated the Brownsville Affair, and the majority in March 1908 reached the same conclusion as Roosevelt. Senator Joseph B. Foraker of Ohio had lobbied for the investigation and filed a minority report in support of the soldiers' innocence. Another minority report by four Republicans concluded that the evidence was too inconclusive to support the discharges. In September 1908, prominent educator and leader W. E. B. DuBois urged black people to register to vote and to remember their treatment by the Republican administration when it was time to vote for president.\n\nFeelings across the nation remained high against the government actions, but with Taft succeeding Roosevelt as President, and Foraker failing to win re-election, some of the political pressure declined.\n\nOn February 23, 1909, the Committee on Military Affairs recommended favorably on Bill S.5729 for correction of records and reenlistment of officers and men of Companies B, C, and D of the 25th Infantry \n\nSenator Foraker was not re-elected. He continued to work on the Brownsville affair during his remaining time in office, guiding a resolution through Congress to establish a board of inquiry with the power to reinstate the soldiers. The bill, which the administration did not oppose, was less than Foraker wanted. He had hoped for a requirement that unless specific evidence was shown against a man, he would be allowed to re-enlist. The legislation passed both houses, and was signed by Roosevelt on March 2, 1909.\n\nOn March 6, 1909, shortly after he left the Senate, Foraker was the guest of honor at a mass meeting at Washington's Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. Though both whites and African Americans assembled to recognize the former senator, all the speakers but Foraker were African American. Presented with a silver loving cup, he addressed the crowd,\nOn April 7, 1909, under the provisions of the Act of March 30, 1909, a Military Court of Inquiry was set up by Secretary of War Jacob M. Dickinson to report on the charges and recommend for reenlistment those men who had been discharged under Special Order # 266, November 9, 1906. Of the 167 discharged men, 76 were located as witnesses, and 6 did not wish to appear.\n\nThe 1910 Court of Military Inquiry undertook an examination of the soldiers' bids for re-enlistment, in view of the Senate committee's reports, but its members interviewed only about one-half of the soldiers discharged. It accepted 14 for re-enlistment, and eleven of these re-entered the Army.\n\nThe government did not re-examine the case until the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1970, historian John D. Weaver published \"The Brownsville Raid,\" which investigated the affair in depth. Weaver argued that the accused members of the 25th Infantry were innocent and that they were discharged without benefit of due process of law as guaranteed by the United States Constitution. After reading his book, Congressman Augustus F. Hawkins of Los Angeles introduced a bill to have the Defense Department re-investigate the matter to provide justice to the accused soldiers.\n\nIn 1972, the Army found the accused members of the 25th Infantry to be innocent. At its recommendations, President Richard Nixon pardoned the men and awarded them honorable discharges, without backpay. These discharges were generally issued posthumously, as there were only two surviving soldiers from the affair: one had re-enlisted in 1910. In 1973, Hawkins and Senator Hubert Humphrey gained congressional passage of a tax-free pension for the last survivor, Dorsie Willis, who received $25,000. He was honored in ceremonies in Washington, DC, and Los Angeles.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30873679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30873679", "title": "Chesapeake–Leopard affair", "text": "Chesapeake–Leopard affair\n\nThe \"Chesapeake\"–\"Leopard\" affair was a naval engagement that occurred off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, on June 22, 1807, between the British warship and the American frigate . The crew of \"Leopard\" pursued, attacked, and boarded the American frigate, looking for deserters from the Royal Navy. \"Chesapeake\" was caught unprepared and after a short battle involving broadsides received from \"Leopard\", the commander of \"Chesapeake\", James Barron, surrendered his vessel to the British. \"Chesapeake\" had fired only one shot.\n\nFour crew members were removed from the American vessel and were tried for desertion, one of whom was subsequently hanged. \"Chesapeake\" was allowed to return home, where James Barron was court martialed and relieved of command.\n\nThe \"Chesapeake–Leopard Affair\" created an uproar among Americans. There were strident calls for war with Great Britain, but these quickly subsided. President Thomas Jefferson initially attempted to use this widespread bellicosity to diplomatically threaten the British government into settling the matter. The United States Congress backed away from armed conflict when British envoys showed no contrition for the \"Chesapeake\" affair, delivering proclamations reaffirming impressment. Jefferson's political failure to coerce Great Britain led him toward economic warfare: the Embargo of 1807.\n\nIn the spring of 1807, during the Napoleonic Wars, several British naval vessels were on duty on the North American Station, blockading two French third-rate warships in the Chesapeake Bay. A number of Royal Navy seamen had deserted from their ships and local American authorities gave them sanctuary. One of the deserters, a Londoner named Jenkin Ratford, joined the crew of . Ratford had made himself conspicuous to British officers by shouting at them on the streets of Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nOther deserters were reported to be at the Gosport Navy Yard, then commanded by Stephen Decatur. Decatur received a letter from the British consul ordering him to turn over three men alleged to have deserted from . The consul claimed the men had enlisted in the U.S. Navy, which was recruiting a crew for \"Chesapeake\", then at the Washington Navy Yard outfitting for a voyage to the Mediterranean.\n\nVice-Admiral Sir George Berkeley dispatched his flagship, the fourth-rate warship , with written orders authorizing him to board and search the United States warship to recover any deserters. Berkeley ordered \"Leopard\"s captain to search for deserters from , , , , , and the cutter .\n\n\"Chesapeake\" was off the coast of Norfolk, Virginia, commanded by Commodore James Barron, when \"Leopard\", under Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, encountered and hailed her. Barron was not alarmed, and received Lieutenant John Meade on board, who presented Barron with the search warrant. After an inconclusive discussion, Meade returned to \"Leopard\". Captain Humphreys, using a hailing trumpet, ordered the American ship to submit. When \"Chesapeake\" did not, Humphreys fired a round across her bow. This was followed immediately by \"Leopard\" firing broadsides into the American ship. Her guns unloaded and her decks cluttered with stores in preparation for a long cruise, \"Chesapeake\" managed to fire only a single gun in reply. The humiliated Barron struck his colors and surrendered. Three of \"Chesapeake\"s crew had been killed and 18 wounded, including Barron, by the attack. However, Humphreys refused the surrender and sent a boarding party to \"Chesapeake\" to search for deserters.\n\nScores of British nationals had signed on as crewmen of \"Chesapeake\", but Humphreys seized only the four Royal Navy deserters: Daniel Martin, John Strachan and William Ware, all from HMS \"Melampus\", and Jenkin Ratford, formerly on . Only Ratford was British-born. The others were American citizens — two of them demonstrably non-British because they were African-Americans, but they had been serving on British warships.\n\nThe brig brought the first dispatches to Halifax in early July. \"Leopard\" followed with her prisoners for trial. Jenkin Ratford, the sole British citizen, was sentenced to death and was hanged from the yardarm of \"Halifax\" on August 31, 1807. The three American deserters received sentences of 500 lashes each, but the sentences were later commuted.\n\nThe bloody encounter caused a storm of protest from the United States government, and the British government eventually offered to return the three American citizens and to pay reparations for the damage to \"Chesapeake\". The schooner returned the last two British deserters to Boston, Massachusetts, one month after the outbreak of the War of 1812.\n\nThe incident outraged the American sense of honor. Americans of every political stripe saw the need to uphold national honor, and to reject the treatment of the United States by Britain as a third class nonentity. Americans talked incessantly about the need for force in response. President Thomas Jefferson noted: \"Never since the Battle of Lexington have I seen this country in such a state of exasperation as at present, and even that did not produce such unanimity.\" James Monroe, then a foreign minister acting under instructions from U.S. Secretary of State James Madison, demanded British disavowal of the deed, the restoration of the four seamen, the recall of Admiral Berkeley, the exclusion of British warships from U.S. territorial waters, and the abolition of impressments from vessels under the United States flag.\n\nThe event raised tensions between the two countries and, while possibly not a direct cause, was one of the events leading up to the War of 1812. In fact, many Americans demanded war because of the attack, but President Jefferson turned to diplomacy and economic pressure in the form of the ill-fated Embargo Act of 1807.\n\nThe Federal government began to be concerned about the lack of war material. Their concerns led to the establishment of a tariff protecting the manufacturers of gunpowder, which helped ensure the fortunes of the DuPont company.\n\nThe humiliating incident had significant repercussions for the U.S. Navy. The public was shocked that \"Chesapeake\" had not been able to put up any resistance and surrendered so quickly, questioning the ability of the Navy to defend the country from a possible British invasion, despite the expensive and controversial frigate-building program. A court-martial blamed Barron and suspended him from service for five years as punishment.\n\nIn 1820, Commodore Barron challenged and mortally wounded Commodore Stephen Decatur in a duel over remarks Decatur had made about Barron's conduct in 1807 (Barron was also wounded). Decatur had served on the court-martial that found Barron guilty of being unprepared and barred him from command for five years.\n\n\"Chesapeake\" herself proved unlucky during the War of 1812, when on June 1, 1813, after a long and surprising series of naval victories over the Royal Navy, the British frigate captured \"Chesapeake\" in a ship-to-ship action near Boston. The Royal Navy commissioned \"Chesapeake\", but put her up for sale at Portsmouth in July 1819. Her timbers are now part of the Chesapeake Mill in Wickham, England.\n\nThe fallout from the \"Chesapeake–Leopard\" affair features prominently in two novels of the Aubrey–Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian. It is first mentioned in the fifth novel, \"Desolation Island\", when the fictional Captain Jack Aubrey is given command of \"Leopard\" (which he privately refers to as the \"horrible old \"Leopard\"\") a few years after the incident. Though the United States and Great Britain are at peace at the time and neither he nor any member of his crew had anything to do with the earlier affair, he is met with mistrust and hostility from American naval personnel due to the negative association of the ship. The subsequent capture of \"Chesapeake\" during the War of 1812 features prominently in the sixth Aubrey–Maturin novel, \"The Fortune of War,\" as Aubrey is aboard during the famous engagement.\n\nThe \"Chesapeake\"–\"Leopard\" affair is mentioned in the \"Boston Jacky\" novel of the Bloody Jack Adventures series by L.A. Meyer.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40075404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40075404", "title": "Concert for Freedom", "text": "Concert for Freedom\n\nThe Concert for Freedom was a concert held at Camp Nou football stadium in Barcelona on June 29, 2013, organized by Òmnium Cultural in conjunction with other civil society organization such as the Assemblea Nacional Catalana and the Plataforma Pro Seleccions Esportives Catalanes with the goal using the universal language of music to demand the right of Catalonia and other nations of the world to freely and democratically decide their future. Some 90,000 people were in attendance. Between the 2012 Catalan independence demonstration and the Catalan Way, the concert was another social mobilization event in favor of independence. More than 400 artists performed, among them Lluís Llach, Sopa de Cabra, Miquel Gil, Pastora, Joana Serrat, Jofre Bardagí, Jordi Batiste, Lídia Pujol, Maria del Mar Bonet, Marina Rossell, Mercedes Peón, Nena Venetsanou, Orfeó Català, Paco Ibáñez, Pascal Comelade, Pau Alabajos, Pep Sala, Peret, Projecte Mut, Sabor de Gràcia, Ferran Piqué, Joan Enric Barceló & Eduard Costa from Els Amics de les Arts, and Brams. The artistic directors were Gerard Quintana and Lluís Danés, who was in charge of set design. The stage featured various steps symbolizing the path toward freedom.\n\nAlso present at Camp Nou were nine members of the Catalan government and representatives from the majority of Catalan political parties that support Catalonia's right to self-determination. Muriel Casals, the president of Òmnium Cultural, gave a speech affirming that \"Catalonia's independence movement is not against anyone or anything\" and requesting that politicians not delay the process toward a referendum.\n\nConcert tickets went on sale on Monday, June 3, and almost all (60,000) were sold the same day, with online wait times to purchase tickets that exceeded six hours. This caused the organization to initially freeze ticket sales and then release 30,000 tickets for sale on the 17th, though these were for seats at the south goal post of the stadium, behind the stage.\n\nWhen the singer Dyango announced his participation in the Concert for Freedom, some Spaniards were outraged. Dyango was not intimidated by the attitudes of the hosts on 13 TV, an ecclesiastic television channel that is one of the stalwarts of Spanish nationalism, in the face of his support for separatism. He affirmed that the current goal is to hold a Catalan referendum, and ultimately achieve full separation from Spain. Peret also denounced pressure and threats he has received for participating in the concert.\n\nSinger-songwriter from the Canary Islands, Pedro Guerra, cancelled his participation in the concert alleging that the event had veered toward \"purely separatist motivations that he doesn't share\" and that \"this is not his fight,\" while affirming that he was not pressured into withdrawing. Singer Mayte Martín also withdrew at the last minute for similar motives.\n\nBefore the concert an information fair was set up outside Camp Nou and the local Food Bank established collection points to benefit the needy, collecting a total of 25 tons of food.\n\nThe event was divided in two halves. In the first half, various artists interpreted songs related to freedom and popular Catalan tunes such as \"L'emigrant\" (The Emigrant) sung by Peret; \"Què volen aquesta gent?\" (What do these people want?) sung by María del Mar Bonet and Companyia Elèctrica Dharma, and \"Camins\" (Paths) sung by Sopa de Cabra. The second half featured songs by Lluís Llach sung both by the artist himself and other artists such as Orfeó Català, Perros, Ramoncín, Pastora and Miquel Gil, in homage to Llach's concert at Camp Nou in 1985, remembered as a protest in supports of the rights of the Catalan nation. At halftime, the Castellers de Vilafranca orchestrated a 9 level high human tower called a \"3 de 9 amb folre\" and they played the Catalan national anthem \"Els segadors,\" while forming a giant mosaic reading \"Freedom Catalonia 2014.\" \n\nDuring the first half, readings were performed between songs by Cristina Plazas, Anna Sahun, Bonaventura Clotet, Manel Esteller, Miquel Casas, Pere Joan Cardona, Alícia Casals, Isona Passola, Ventura Pons, Joel Joan, Jordi Díaz, Josep Pedrals, Lluís Soler, Màrius Serra, Matthew Tree, Montserrat Carulla, Núria Feliu, Quim Masferrer, Roger Coma and Sílvia Bel.\n\nReadings were written by Bertolt Brecht, Dolors Miquel, Enric Casasses, Jacint Verdaguer (La veu del Montseny), Joan Margarit, Joana Raspall (El vell vestit), Maria Àngels Anglada, Marià Villangómez, Miquel Martí i Pol, Montserrat Abelló, Salvador Espriu (El meu poble i jo), Vicent Andrés Estellés, Joan Brossa, Josep Maria de Sagarra (La campana de Sant Honorat).\n\nThe Concert for Freedom was covered by several international media agencies (such as Reuters and The Associated Press) and various newspapers, television and radio stations from France, Germany, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands, Portugal, etc. One of the most talked-about images from the event by the media was the mosaic that unfolded in the stands during the playing of the national anthem of Catalonia.\n\nAmong the articles covering the event were:\n\n\n"}

The crash occurred in Los Gatos Canyon and not in the town of Los Gatos itself, which is in Santa Clara County, approximately 150 miles away. Guthrie was inspired to write the song by what he considered the racist mistreatment of the passengers before and after the accident. The crash resulted in the deaths of 32 people, 4 Americans and 28 migrant farm workers who were being deported from California back to Mexico.\n\nThe genesis of \"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\" reportedly occurred when Guthrie was struck by the fact that radio and newspaper coverage of the Los Gatos plane crash did not give the victims' names, but instead referred to them merely as \"deportees.\" Guthrie lived in New York City at the time, and none of the deportees' names were printed in the January 29, 1948, \"New York Times\" report, only those of the flight crew and the security guard. However, the local newspaper, \"The Fresno Bee\", covered the tragedy extensively and listed all of the known names of the deportees.\n\nUnaware of the extensive local coverage of the disaster, Guthrie responded with a poem, which, when it was first written, featured only rudimentary musical accompaniment, with Guthrie chanting the song rather than singing it. In the poem, Guthrie assigned symbolic names to the dead: \"Goodbye to my Juan, goodbye Rosalita; adiós, mis amigos, Jesús y María...\" A decade later, Guthrie's poem was set to music and given a haunting melody by a schoolteacher named Martin Hoffman. Shortly after, folk singer Pete Seeger, a friend of Woody Guthrie, began performing the song at concerts, and it was Seeger's rendition that popularized the song during this time.\n\nIt has been suggested by the Three Rocks Research website that, in fact, \"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\" betrays Guthrie's lack of understanding regarding the Bracero Program. The program was a series of laws and diplomatic agreements created by the U.S. Congress in 1942, that permitted Mexican farm laborers (or Braceros) to work in the United States due to the severe labor shortages caused by World War II. Under the terms of the program, the labor contractors were expected to provide transportation to and from the Mexican border, with the U.S. Immigration Service being required to repatriate the Mexican citizens if the contractor defaulted. As such, the \"deportation\" of Braceros in this fashion was simply a way of meeting the obligations of the program—although some newspapers, e.g., the New York Times, did refer to the braceros as \"deportees\". However, the presence in the song of the lines, \"Some of us are illegal, and some are not wanted/Our work contract's out and we have to move on.\" suggests that Guthrie did in fact understand the workings of the Bracero Program. Furthermore, it could be argued that Guthrie's song is less about the program itself and more a comment on the attitude of American society and the media towards the Mexican farm laborers.\n\nIn addition to being a lament for the braceros killed in the crash, the opening lines of \"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\":\n\n<poem>The crops are all in and the peaches are rott'ning,\nThe oranges piled in their creosote dumps.\"</poem>\n\nare another protest by Guthrie. At the time, government policies paid farmers to destroy their crops in order to keep farm production and prices high. Guthrie felt that it was wrong to render food inedible by poisoning it in a world where hungry people lived.\n\n\"Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)\" has been described by journalist Joe Klein as \"the last great song he [Guthrie] would write, a memorial to the nameless migrants 'all scattered like dry leaves' in Los Gatos Canyon.\" The song has been recorded many times, often under a variety of other titles, including \"Deportees\", \"Ballad of the Deportees\", \"Deportee Song\", \"Plane Crash at Los Gatos\" and \"Plane Wreck at Los Gatos (Deportee)\".\n\nThe song has been recorded by many artists, including:\n\n"}

He gained media coverage, resulting in international outrage over his plans and pleas from world leaders to cancel the event. Jones's threat sparked protests in the Middle East and Asia, in which at least 20 people were killed. In early September 2010, Jones cancelled and pledged never to burn a Quran.\n\nNevertheless, on March 20, 2011, Jones held a \"trial of the Quran\" in his Gainesville church. Finding the scriptures guilty of \"crimes against humanity,\" the Quran was burned in the church sanctuary. Protesters in the northern Afghanistan city of Mazar-i-Sharif and elsewhere attacked the United Nations Assistance Mission, killing at least 30 people, including at least seven United Nations workers, and injuring at least 150 people. Jones disclaimed any responsibility. Norwegian, Swedish, Nepalese and Romanian nationals were among the UN workers killed. The killing of two US soldiers by an Afghan policeman on 4 April 2011 was attributed to anger over the burning of the Quran. American news analysts criticized and blamed Hamid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, for drawing attention to the Quran burning.\n\nTerry Jones was born in October 1951 in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. He attended college for two years, worked at a hotel, and joined the now defunct Maranatha Campus Ministries. He moved to Cologne, Germany, where in 1981 he founded a charismatic church, the Christian Community of Cologne (CGK).\n\nJones received an honorary degree from an unaccredited theology school in 1983, and began using the title \"Doctor.\" He was fined for this misuse of a credential title by a German administrative court. By the late 2000s, the CGK grew to have a membership of approximately 800–1000. According to the German magazine, \"Der Spiegel\", the congregation kicked Jones out in 2008 due to the \"climate of fear and control\" that he employed, which included elements of \"brainwashing\" and telling congregants to beat their children with rods. He was accused of improper use of church funds, and forcing congregants to labor for free. A leader of the Cologne church said Jones did not \"project the biblical values and Christianity, but always made himself the center of everything.\" Others accused him of being violent and fanatical. \"Deutsche Presse-Agentur\" reported that church members said Jones ran the Cologne church like a cult, using psychological pressure.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2008, Jones served as the part-time pastor of the Gainesville, Florida church Dove World Outreach, frequently traveling back and forth between Germany and the United States. Jones assumed full-time duties at Dove World Outreach in 2008 after leaving the German church. By September 2010, Dove World was said to have 50 members, with about 30 members reportedly attending services.\n\nIn 2010 Jones published \"Islam Is of the Devil\", a polemic that claims Islam promotes violence, and that Muslims want to impose sharia law in the United States. After Jones announced the Quran burning, the German Evangelical Alliance denounced his theological statements and his craving for attention.\n\nFollowing an invitation from the English Defence League, Jones considered attending a rally in Luton in the U.K. in February 2011 to share his views. The anti-fascist group Hope not Hate petitioned the Home Secretary to ban Jones from entering the country. In January 2011 the Home Secretary announced that Jones would be refused entry to the UK 'for the public good'.\n\nJones' actions have prompted a religious group to place a $1.2 million bounty on his head; Hezbollah, a Lebanese political party and militant group, has announced a $2 million bounty.\n\nOn April 22, 2011, Jones planned to visit the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan to protest sharia but was arrested, tried and jailed. Local authorities had required him either to post a $45,000 \"peace bond\" to cover Dearborn's cost if Jones was attacked by extremists or to go to trial. Jones contested that requirement, and the jury voted to require the posting of a $1 \"peace bond\", but Jones and his co-pastor Wayne Sapp continued to refuse to pay. They were held briefly in jail, while claiming violation of First Amendment rights. That night Jones was released by the court. On November 11, 2011, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Robert Ziolkowski vacated the \"breach of peace\" ruling against Terry Jones and Wayne Sapp on the grounds that they were denied due process. Both men's criminal records have since been expunged.\n\nOn the evening of April 22, 2012, soon after he was interviewed at WJBK-TV, Jones' gun fired accidentally as he got into his car.\n\nThe city allowed him to protest on April 29, a week after the trial, in a designated \"free speech zone\" outside Dearborn City Hall. Muslim protesters lined Michigan Avenue across the street from City Hall. About an hour into the protest, the crowds broke the barricades and a police line. They rushed the street but were quickly contained by riot police crews. The crowd was throwing water bottles and shoes at supporters of Jones. Police worked to push the crowd back across Michigan Avenue. At least one arrest was made.\n\nIn 2010 Jones announced plans to burn the Quran on the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks, which he dubbed \"International Burn a Quran Day\". A wide range of politicians and religious groups strongly condemned the planned Quran desecration event. Jones said he canceled the event and intended to go to New York to meet with the imam of Park51, Feisal Abdul Rauf. After saying he would never burn the scriptures, on March 20, 2011, Jones oversaw the burning of a Quran.\n\nThis prompted protests, including an attack in Afghanistan that resulted in the deaths of at least 14 people. In April 2011, Jones claimed he is considering a trial of the Prophet Muhammad for \"crimes against humanity.\"\n\nDove World Outreach Center, where the Quran burning was to occur, is a small congregation in Gainesville, with approximately 50 members. The church, led by pastor Terry Jones and his wife, Sylvia, first gained media attention in the late 2000s (decade) for its anti-Islamic and anti-homosexual messages. In 2009, Dove World posted a sign on its lawn which stated in large red letters \"Islam is of the Devil\". Several members of the church also sent their children to their first day of school in August 2009 wearing t-shirts with \"Islam is of the Devil\" printed on the back.\n\nThe proposal to burn Qurans began with a series of Twitter messages on July 12, and a related discussion on the now-removed Facebook group \"Islam is of the Devil\", named after Terry Jones's book. Jones invited Christians to burn the Muslim holy book to remember all 9/11 victims. It was to be held from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. The idea initially had little support and considerable opposition, but Religion News Service ran a story describing Jones's claim that he had received Qurans to burn. CAIR refused to respond, but other religious organizations did. On July 25 Jones posted a YouTube video in which he held up a Quran and said \"This is the book that is responsible for 9/11. No, to me it looks like the religion of the devil\" which garnered substantial media attention. On August 3, Gainesville mayor Craig Lowe asked the world's media to ignore Jones's church as a \"tiny fringe group and an embarrassment to our community\", but coverage continued to increase. In early August, Sunni scholars at al-Azhar University in Cairo issued a statement warning of \"dangerous consequences\" if Qurans were burned. U.S. President Obama condemned the plan saying it would endanger the lives of U.S. troops abroad. American Muslims responded by saying they would celebrate September 11, 2010 as 'love Jesus day' emphasizing the fact that Jesus is believed to be a messenger of God in Islam. Other groups asked people to celebrate Read the Quran day as a means to international understanding.\n\nA Gainesville Interfaith Forum which was established in November 2009 in response to earlier anti-Islam activities of the church requested for the declaration of September 11 as \"Interfaith Solidarity Day\", a request that was honored by mayor Craig Lowe. The Forum scheduled a \"Gathering for Peace, Understanding and Hope\" at Trinity United Methodist Church on the day before the planned burning. Mayor Lowe referred to Dove World as a \"tiny fringe group and an embarrassment to our community\". 20 local religious leaders gathered Thursday, September 2, 2010, to call for citizens to rally around Muslims \"in a time when so much venom is directed toward them.\"\n\nShortly after the event was announced the National Association of Evangelicals recommended that the event be canceled. The Southern Baptist convention also spoke out against it The World Evangelical Alliance \"asks Muslim neighbors to recognize that the plans announced by a Florida group to burn copies of the Quran on September 11 do not represent the vast majority of Christians.\" \"It dishonors the memory of those who died in the 9/11 attacks and further perpetuates unacceptable violence.\" The event is broadly condemned by American religious leaders.\n\nJohn Rankin, President of the Theological Education Institute in Connecticut, has started a \"Yes to the Bible, No to the Burning of the Quran\" effort. Also Jennifer Bryson is advocating Christian intra-faith dialogue and Christian rejection of \"Burn a Quran Day\".\n\nFeisal Abdul Rauf, the cleric behind the move to build a Muslim community centre near \"Ground Zero\" (Park51) said that, should the burning of Qurans have gone ahead,\n\nit would have created a disaster in the Muslim world. It would have strengthened the radicals. It would have enhanced the possibility of terrorist acts against America and American interests.\n\nHe also added that retracting the decision to build the mosque would send a wrong message that \"moving it is that the headline in the Muslim world will be Islam is under attack in America.\"\n\nA group of American veterans of the War in Iraq and the War in Afghanistan wrote an open letter to the \"Huffington Post\" calling on the American public to respect \"the values we risked our lives to protect\". \"When citizens here participate in hateful rhetoric and intolerance toward Muslims, it leaves soldiers over there exposed.\" The letter concludes by asking \"America, you gotta have our back.\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, \"It's regrettable that a pastor in Gainesville, Florida with a church of no more than fifty people can make this outrageous and distressful, disgraceful plan and get, you know, the world's attention.\" She also said, \"It doesn't in any way represent America or Americans or American government or American religious or political leadership,\" and she emphasized the hope of the U.S. Government that the church would not go through with their plans. US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called Pastor Jones asking him not to go through with his Quran burning. The US embassy in Kabul issued a statement condemning the plans. Robert Gibbs, White House Press Secretary, criticized the plans stating \"any type of activity like that that puts our troops in harm's way would be a concern to this administration\".\n\nThe commander of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus said, \"It is precisely the kind of action the Taliban uses and could cause significant problems. Not just here, but everywhere in the world we are engaged with the Islamic community.\" On the same day hundreds of Afghans protested in Kabul against the planned Quran burning event, chanting \"death to America\" and throwing rocks at a passing military convoy. Military officials also expressed fears that the protests would spread to other cities. Military officers at the Pentagon consequently said they hoped the rare incursion into politics by a military commander would convince Pastor Jones to cancel his plans. The pastor responded to Petraeus' statement that, \"We understand the General's concerns. We are sure that his concerns are legitimate. [Nonetheless] [w]e must send a clear message to the radical element of Islam. We will no longer be controlled and dominated by their fears and threats.\"\n\nRepublicans in Congress also criticized Jones and his plans. \"Just because you have a right to do something in America does not mean it is the right thing to do,\" said U.S. House Minority Leader John Boehner. Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin also criticized Jones, calling his plans \"insensitive and an unnecessary provocation\", and Republican 2008 presidential nominee John McCain and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell both argued that the actions of Jones put American troops overseas at risk. President Obama made a statement on ABC News regarding this event, stating that \"what he is purposing to do is completely contrary to our values as Americans.\" He added that Terry Jones's plan to burn the Quran will put American soldiers at risk. David Wood disagreed with pastor Terry Jones attempts in the Quran burning, and compared it to the Uthman Quran burning. One book distribution website, SacredBookSource.com, offered to give away 1,001 free Qurans and 1,000 free Bibles for every Quran Jones destroyed.\n\nThe German Evangelical Alliance formally dissociated itself from the proposed Quran burning, because of the widely circulated report that in his time in Cologne, Jones had been associated with the evangelical alliance.\n\nThe \"Al-Falluja\" web forum threatened a bloody war against America in response to the burning of the Quran.\n\nVarious other Muslims, such as the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community have argued that the Dove World Outreach Center is not following the true teachings of Christianity of tolerance and love. They quote Jesus: \"But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you...\"(Gospel of Matthew 5:44–45). The Head of the Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad, has stated that \"Religious extremism, be it Christian extremism, Muslim extremism or any other kind, is never a true reflection of the religion\".\n\nOn August 27, approximately 100 people protested in Indonesia outside the U.S. Embassy. Roni Ruslan of Hizbut Tahrir, which advocates Islamic law, said,\n\nNo one will be able to control this reaction... We urge the U.S. government and Christian leaders to stop the crazy plan from this small sect. It's an insult to Islam and to 1.5 billion Muslims around the world.\n\nOn September 4, thousands of Indonesians, mostly Muslims, took part in events across the country organized by Hizbut Tahrir. Rokhmat Labib, chairman of the group, called the planned book burning a provocation and predicted that Muslims would fight back should it take place. Lahib said that Muslims must not stay silent when their faith is threatened.\n\nThe World Evangelical Alliance condemned the plans to burn the Quran.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints issued a statement declaring that \"A key tenet of our faith is to accord everyone the freedom to worship as they choose. It is regrettable that anyone would regard the burning of any scriptural text as a legitimate form of protest or disagreement.\"\n\nThe International Humanist and Ethical Union was also critical of the plans to burn the Quran.\n\nOn Friday, September 10 in the northern Afghan city of Fayzabad, thousands took part in a protest against the planned Quran-burning following Eid ul-Fitr prayers. Violent demonstrators threw stones at a German-controlled NATO base. Initial reports said troops inside opened fire, killing up to three people and injuring several others, but a local police official said that only local police, not the NATO troops, were involved in the shooting. According to the acting police chief of Badakshan the protesters broke down the first perimeter gate surrounding the base and beat Afghan security guards and police on duty with sticks. Before opening fire police allegedly fired warning shots and were also fired upon from the direction of the demonstrators, said the police official. A local police chief talking to the BBC gave his estimates of the number of protesters to around 1,500 but said that the incident that led to the shooting was a separate one with 150 people participating. This official also said that private security guards were the ones who fired at the people who tried to force their way inside the base. NATO has launched an investigation into the incident. General Zahir Khan of the Kabul police described Quran-burning a thinly disguised pretext for anti-government rallies with the Taliban in attendance.\n\nProtest rallies were held in several other Afghan provinces: Nimruz, Kunar, Nangarhar, Parwan, Baghlan, Kunduz, Balkh and Farah. The Afghan President Hamid Karzai also spoke out against the burning of Qurans saying, \"By burning the Quran, they cannot harm it. The Quran is in the hearts and minds of one-and-a-half billion people. Insulting the Quran is an insult to nations.\" Protests continued throughout the next two days, with three protesters wounded on September 11 and four on September 12 as Afghan security forces shot into groups of protesters, some armed with sticks or throwing stones, to disperse them. Two died in hospital due to severe gunshot wounds. On September 11, protests continued in the country, when Afghan security forces fought back thousands of demonstrators. Four demonstrators were wounded by security forces; firing when they tried to storm several government buildings in Pul-e-Alam, in Logar province. They also hurled stones at such buildings as the department for women's affairs. In Badakhshan province, another thousand people protested three separate districts, though the police chief said it was peaceful.\n\nThe prominent Qatar based scholar, Yusuf al-Qaradawi despite condemning the desecration said,\n\nResponding to an assault is not by carrying out another assault, as this is discouraged in Islam ... Moreover, we, as Muslims, are required to show respect to and believe in the divinely-revealed books and all preceding prophets. If a person insults Jesus (peace be upon him), I, as a Muslim, should feel annoyed by this and act in his defense. This is what happened upon the release of a film which attacked Jesus: Muslims living in the country where the film was shown reacted angrily in protest. We believe in and highly respect all prophets and messengers, including Moses and Jesus (peace be upon them all)... The noble Quran even goes further and forbids us from cursing the pagans' idols, saying: (And do not abuse those whom they call upon besides Allah, lest exceeding the limits they should abuse Allah out of ignorance.) (Al-An`am 6:108).\n\nSmall rallies were reported in Pakistan in Karachi and the central Pakistani city Multan with around 200 protesters. There were also protests in Indonesia, Gaza, and India, a non-Muslim majority country. On September 15, regarding reports that at least 20 deaths worldwide were connected to Quran desecration protests, Randall Terry responded that \"Such logic is like saying that a woman who is abused by her boyfriend or husband is guilty of bringing violence on herself because she said or did something that irritated him.\"\n\nProtests in Kashmir escalated over several days, as Quran demonstrations quickly turned into separatist protests against the Indian government in the Muslim-majority province. On September 13, protesters defied a military-imposed curfew, setting fire to a Christian missionary school and government buildings. At least 13 people were shot dead by police, and one policeman was killed by a thrown rock; at least 113 policemen and 45 protesters were wounded. On September 12, a church was burned and a curfew instituted in Punjab. Violence also spread into Poonch in the Jammu division, with three protesters shot by police. Protesters burned several government offices and vehicles. Police prevented the burning of a Christian school in Poonch, and another in Mendhar the next day, in clashes leaving four protesters killed, 19 wounded, but dozens of government offices, a police station, and eight vehicles were burned. As of September 16, the Hindustan Times placed the death toll at 90, blaming much of the resentment on the indefinite military curfew, the first in ten years to affect the entire Kashmir Valley.\n\nIn Somalia, the al-Qaida-inspired group Al-Shabaab organized a protest rally against the Quran-burning attended by thousands.\n\nThe head of Iran's Islamic Culture and Relations Organization labeled the Quran burning proposal a \"Zionist\" insult. A group of Iranian students also protested outside the Swiss embassy in Tehran to protest the desecration of the Quran, and chanted slogans condemned the desecration on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. The Iranian \"House of Cartoon\" invited international artists to an online exhibition to condemn the desecration of the Qurans on the theme of \"Devil against Holy Books\", \"Devil against Human Nature\" and \"Terry Jones\". More than 30 cartoons had been submitted from Iran, Turkey, Brazil, Ukraine and other countries since the event was announced on September 13. While there would be no prizes, the entries would be published at a later date. Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki called the proposal \"heinous\" at a joint press conference with his Malawian counterpart Etta Banda. He also added that \"The stance of the Muslim world, including the Islamic Republic of Iran, is transparent: Condemnation of this heinous, insulting and sacrilegious act by whomever perpetuated it. We clearly see the hands of the Zionists behind all threats and provocative moves [aimed to strain relations] between the believers of various faiths. This is exactly the sort of extremist move that seeks to realize their objectives through creating religious discord.\"\n\nIran's ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Khazaee, said he had filed a complaint with the body to \"attract the international community's attention to Iran's stance and to warn against the serious repercussions of insulting the holy book of Muslims and hurting the religious feelings of more than one-fourth of the world's population.\" He also condemned the actions as \"abhorrent.\" Iran's parliament speaker Ali Larijani censured the US for its apparent silence on the \"outrageous act of desecrating the holy Quran, urging the Muslim world to take swift action against it.\" He added that the \"silence of those who beat the drums for freedom and democracy on the blasphemous decision has drawn the ire of freedom-seeking humans and stirred international hatred of the US.\" He also said the desecration of the Quran would be a \"brutal\" act that shows \"barbarism in the modern era.\" While he concluded that such measures would \"undoubtedly hurt spiritual and religious feelings of millions of Muslims across the world as well as followers of all divine faiths,\" and warned American legislators they should expect a \"harsh fate\" if they do not act \"wisely.\" The parliament's Presiding Board member, Mohammad Dehqan, said that \"Whenever Zionists want to cover up their atrocities in Palestine, they try to trigger anti-Islamic sentiments across the United States and the West to deflect global public attention from their brutalities against Palestinians.\" He also criticised the \"Zionists\" for trying to paint a violent picture of Islam to discourage others from converting to Islam; he went on to urge Muslims around the world to \"remain united to stop the recurrence of similar profane moves.\" The head of the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of parliament, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, said the \"US police reluctance to react to such sacrilegious action indicates Washington's green light to such a heinous crime. The US government should take serious action against the perpetrators of this provocative move and declare its stance on that regard.\" Grand Ayatollahs Hossein Noori Hamedani and Naser Makarem Shirazi favored the killing of Quran-burners, but that the permission of a religious judge was required.\n\nIn Iraq, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani cautioned people to show restraint labeling the act \"expression of hatred of Islam.\"\n\nA hacker with nickname \"Iraq Resistance\" posted a voice-altered video to YouTube published under the byname \"iqziad\", claiming to have released the \"Here you have\" worm to \"demand respect for Islam\", blaming Terry Jones, and saying \"I can smash all of those infected, but I wouldn't\". The worm, first discovered August 20, attacked organizations including NASA, Walt Disney, and the Florida Department of Transportation, and produced spam that rose to 10% of all email traffic on September 9.\n\nIn South Africa, on September 10, Johannesburg businessman Mohammed Vawda had announced his own intention to burn the Bible on September 11 in the Johannesburg CBD in response to DWOC's own announcement. However, an Islamic lawyers' association, Scholars of the Truth, quickly intervened by filing an injunction against Vawda in court on the basis of opposition against burning any religious texts, and Judge Sita Kolbe of the South Gauteng High Court granted the injunction, thus prohibiting Vawda's announced burning. Lawyer and Scholars of the Truth spokesperson Yasmin Omar, who spearheaded the injunction with her husband Zahir, stated that the judge's ruling established that \"freedom of expression is not unlimited if one exercises freedom of expression that is harmful to others\".\n\n. Prime Minister Stephen Harper, condemned the planned Quran-burning in unequivocal terms, and said, \"My God and my Christ is a tolerant God, and that's what we want to see in this world\".\n\n. Former president Fidel Castro called the planned book burning \"a huge media show\". After Jones called off the event, Castro said, \"It would be nice to know what the FBI agents who visited him said 'to persuade him.'\"\n\n. Defence minister Hervé Morin said that the threatened Quran burning and a French ban on full length Islamic veils enacted shortly afterward did not put French or NATO troops at increased risk: \"when you are at the maximum, you cannot go higher\".\n\n. Chancellor Angela Merkel said of the planned Florida event, \"It is plainly disrespectful – even abhorrent. It's simply wrong.\"\n\n. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono warned in a televised speech that the plans to burn the Quran threatened world peace.\n\n. Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said \"All Muslims hold the US government and their politicians accountable. If the US government is sincere in its claims of not having been involved in this incident, it must mete out a befitting punishment to the main perpetrators of this serious crime\". President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called the plan a \"Zionist plot that is against the teachings of all divine prophets.\"\n\n. President Michel Suleiman denounced the plans adding that burning the Quran is a clear contradiction of the teachings of the three Abrahamic religions [Christianity, Islam and Judaism] and of dialogue among the three faiths.\"\n\n's government strongly condemned the plan. Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit told reporters \"This is against the spirit of any religion, the government and the people of Pakistan, including Pakistani Christians, are outraged at this planned, shameful act by a self-proclaimed pastor.\"\n\n. In Gaza, Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh called Terry Jones a \"crazy priest who reflects a crazy Western attitude toward Islam and the Muslim nation.\"\n\n. President Barack Obama said \"I just want [Jones] to understand that this stunt that he is talking about pulling could greatly endanger our young men and women in uniform who are in Iraq, who are in Afghanistan.\" He also said that the planned event was being used as an al-Qaeda recruitment tool, and urged that the Quran burning be cancelled because it violated U.S. principles of religious tolerance. The president also expressed frustration that under the law, nothing could be done other than citing the church under a local ordinance for public burnings.\n\n. The Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue issued a statement saying that the book burning would be \"an outrageous and grave gesture\".\n\n. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, NATO Secretary General, said that the church's plans would violate NATO's values and might have a negative impact on the security of its soldiers.\n\n. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he was \"deeply disturbed\", adding that such a gesture would be intolerable by any religion.\n\nSome in the media attributed the event to silly season and sensationalism.\n\nJames Poniewozik, of \"Time\" gave a few reasons for media coverage of the event: \"tiny groups of fringe idiots\" often get coverage, presumably because the vast majority of readers find them strange and different. The event also happens to coincide with a seeming American \"Islamophobia\" and concern over the \"Ground Zero mosque;\" he also added that \"This is, unfortunately, one of those cases in which, by having become news, the story is now making legitimate news.\" \"Slate\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s David Weigel, said reporters should \"Ignore This Idiot\" (the title of his blog post on the controversy). \"[Jones] gets to hold the country, or at least the part of the country that pays attention to such news, hostage, with reporters getting the secretary of state and our general in Afghanistan on the record to condemn this nobody. Instead of dying in obscurity, he'll die a has-been. Good work.\" \"ABC News\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> Chris Cuomo wrote that the \"media gave life to this Florida burning ... and that was reckless.\" Roger Simon, a columnist for \"Politico\" responded to David Petraeus' remarks saying \"The issue is not the images; it is the acts.\"\n\nBoth the Associated Press and Fox News stated their intention to ignore it.\n\nThe conservative \"Powerline\" blog stated it was against the Qu'ran burning, but also said that \"what gives rise to this dilemma, of course, is the fanaticism of radical Muslims, who have, indeed, responded violently to real or perceived slights to their religion.\" John Hinderaker, a lawyer and freelance writer, argued that \"Perversely, the crazier radical Muslims behave, the more it benefits them (those burning the Qurans). Today it is burning Qurans, but the broader objective is to outlaw, de facto, any criticism of Islam.\" Another conservative writer Michelle Malkin, echoed an article by Christopher Hitchens, when she bemoaned \"the eternal flame of Muslim outrage. When everything from sneakers to stuffed animals to comics to frescos to beauty queens to fast-food packaging to undies serves as dry tinder for Allah's avengers, it's a grand farce to feign concern about the recruitment effect of a few burnt Qurans in the hands of a two-bit attention-seeker in Florida.\"\n\nA Facebook page support the pastor's plan got more than 16,000 fans by eve of the event, while fans opposing the event numbered in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nThe Gainesville fire department refused to grant the church a burning permit; regardless, the church planned to proceed with the event despite the potential fine. Following the July 2010 announcement of the Quran burning, the bank holding a $140,000 mortgage loan on the church property, demanded immediate repayment of the balance, and the property insurance was canceled. A lighted sign and an acrylic cross on the property were damaged by rocks. On September 8, 2010, Rackspace, the provider of web hosting service to the Dove World Outreach website, disconnected the site, citing a violation of their terms of use policy. A spokesman for Rackspace told news media that the shutdown was not \"a constitutional issue,\" it was \"a contract issue.\" \n\nThe city of Gainesville has said it would charge the church $200,000, representing the cost of a security presence by the police department, the Alachua County Sheriff's Office, and some city public works employees. The Alachua County Sheriff's Office estimated that it spent $100,000 on providing security to Jones, and specifically assigned 160 of the 242 deputies on duty September 11 to police activities related to the planned burning.\n\nJones said that he hoped the event would not lead to violence. He said that he had been receiving death threats regularly since the event was announced. Evan Kohlmann of Flashpoint Global Partners, a firm that \"tracks radical militant websites,\" said that a suicide bomber had threatened to drive a truck into the church and others had discussed setting the building on fire, though it was not known if the discussions were serious. The Wall Street Journal quoted an individual calling himself Abu Dujanah from a jihadist website, \"Now, I wish to bomb myself in this church as revenge for the sake of Allah's talk... And here I register my name here that I want to be an intended martyr.\"\n\nWhen death threats directed against Jones were mailed to \"The Gainesville Sun\" in a letter postmarked from Johnstown, Pa., the American Muslim Association of North America issued a statement signed by 15 imams including Ahmed Al Mehdawi of the Islamic Center of Gainesville condemning the death threats. During Jones's September 11 visit to New York, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said that police plan to keep a \"close tab on him\" for his own safety.\n\nIn March 2013 the al-Qaeda English-language magazine \"Inspire\" published a poster stating \"Wanted dead or alive for crimes against Islam\" with a prominent image of Terry Jones.\n\nWithin hours of Jones's cancellation announcement on September 9, Westboro Baptist Church member Megan Roper announced via Twitter that the church would proceed with its own Quran-burning ceremony; Her mother said she was angry that the media had not covered WBC's 2008 Quran-burning similarly to its approach in 2010. Phelps announced his intention to \"burn the Quran and the doomed American flag at noon on September 11\", subsequently doing so without incident.\n\nDuncan Philp of the Wyoming Tyranny Response Team obtained a permit to protest outside the Wyoming State Capitol from 11:00 to 13:00 on September 11. He expressed the intent to set a Quran on fire at noon, or, if the public burning was not permitted, to tear up the Quran and move the pieces in a garbage can to a private business to be burned. Members of the local Unitarian Universalist Church planned a counter-protest. Later the group described the exercise as a test of free speech and said they would take no action on state property.\n\nIn Pueblo West, a Quran was bolted to a stop sign during the weekend of September 11–12.\n\nIn Nashville, Evangelical pastor Bob Old and another preacher burned a Quran with lighter fluid in a private yard. A group of protesters came to his house, but there were no confrontations. He decided not to post the burning to YouTube.\n\nIn lower Manhattan, protesters against the \"Ground Zero mosque\" took some actions against the Quran. The latter, who refused to identify himself, was reported to have been \"escorted away to safety a few blocks away\" by police after burning a few pages. He was subsequently recognized as a New Jersey transit worker, and was fired by the agency for violating a code of conduct, despite being off-duty while at a protest in New York. This in turn has drawn criticism from New Jersey state senator Ray Lesniak and the American Civil Liberties Union, which said a person employed in a non-policy related role cannot be fired for off-the-job political expression.\nAlso, in Texas, on the ninth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, a group of protesters made up of Christians, Muslims, Buddhists and atheists gathered at Sam Houston Park in order to challenge the plan of evangelist David Grisham, director of a Christian activist group to burn the Quran. An activist named Isom took away the Quran from Grisham and he left the park.\n\nAlex Stewart, a research lawyer in Brisbane, Australia, purportedly rolled \"joints\" using pages from the Quran and the Bible and smoked them in a YouTube video. The video was quickly removed from YouTube. but many copies have since been posted and related links. According to Michael Cope, president of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, \"I don't think on the face of it that what he's done is an offence...nor do we think it should be,\" referring to the Queensland Anti-Discrimination Act. Stewart was placed on leave from Queensland University of Technology, where he worked, by its vice-chancellor Peter Coaldrake pending a review under the university's code of conduct. Coaldrake said, \"The university is obviously extremely, extremely unhappy and disappointed that this sort of incident should occur... It may have occurred in the individual's private time or on a weekend – it doesn't matter... There is always, in the community, collateral damage to these sorts of things.\" Stewart was returned to his job on September 22 after he had \"apologised unreservedly\" for the nature of the incident.\n\nWith mainstream media sources pledging to limit coverage of Quran burning, individuals took to YouTube. A YouTube spokesperson indicated that they do not prescreen videos, and generally responded to complaints about the issue by placing warnings about offensive material. The Huffington Post questioned why the Quran-burning story was treated as major news, while many news outlets did not cover the prosecution of 12 soldiers for crimes including the premeditated murder of Afghan civilians, possibly for sport, and the keeping of body parts as trophies. Keith Richburg, a journalist for the Washington Post in Beijing, said that professional journalists \"act as a filter on what information should be released or left out so that it does not hurt society\", and warned that digital media allows the role of media as a gatekeeper to be undermined. American counterintelligence experts said that with no images of Quran burnings televised during the September 11 anniversary, that violent anti-American protests in Muslim countries would soon fizzle.\n\nA Quran was found shot and burned in the driveway of the Annoor Mosque in Knoxville, Tennessee. Knoxville police and the FBI began investigating the incident as a possible civil rights violation, a threat, and a hate crime. A YouTube video posted by a user \"MuslimKnoxvilleOrg\" showing the burning of a Quran stuffed with bacon and doused with lighter fluid was also being investigated, though it was not immediately connected to the mosque. According to Knoxville FBI Special Agent Richard L. Lambert, \"The fact that the burnt and shot Quran was placed on mosque property can be construed as a threat of force ... The issue comes down to determining what was the perpetrator's intent.\" Federal charges were considered, based on a 1968 law making it an offense \"to use force to prevent anyone from carrying out their religious beliefs\"; state charges were also considered under Tennessee civil rights law prohibiting intimidation, and misdemeanor offenses such as disorderly conduct were also explored.\n\nIn Michigan, a burned Quran was found in front of the Islamic Center of East Lansing. Local police and the FBI were called in to investigate. Dawud Walid, director of Michigan's Islamic council chapter said, \"This is no different than someone painting a swastika on a synagogue or burning a cross on a black church.\" On September 21, the County Prosecutor said the man who turned himself in for the incident would not face charges because the act was not a crime under Michigan's criminal code.\n\nOn the north side of Chicago, Illinois, a burned Quran and a letter were found on the sidewalk outside the Muslim Community Center over the September 11–12 weekend, and were turned over to be investigated by Chicago police bomb and arson unit.\n\nOn September 9, Jones announced the cancellation of the event, and a plan to fly to New York to meet with the Imam of Park51, Feisal Abdul Rauf. In an interview on the morning of September 11, the day of the intended protest, he said, \"We will definitely not burn the Quran...Not today, not ever.\" Despite the cancellation, visiting protesters from both sides attempted to reach the rally, but a heavy police presence dominated the area. A visitor from Atlanta who attempted to burn a Quran had his book and lighter seized by police.\n\nThe World Evangelical Alliance later contacted Jones, asking him to apologize for the planned Quran burning. In a public statement, he refused, saying, \"We will not repent for standing up for the gospel\", adding that Christian churches \"have lost their guts to stand up for Christianity. But instead, they bow down to the political powers and the false doctrines of the nations.\"\n\nAs of October 22, 2010, Jones collected a new car which was offered as a reward to Jones in a \"quirky radio\" ad by a New Jersey Hyundai dealership owned by former New York Giants, Brad Benson if Jones did not burn Qurans. Jones said he did not learn of the reward until several weeks after canceling the burning. Jones donated the car to charity.\n\nOn January 19, 2011, it was announced that Jones had been banned from entering the United Kingdom by the British Home Secretary Theresa May. Jones had been invited to give a speech for a Right-Wing group England is Ours in Milton Keynes.\n\nOn March 20, 2011, Dove World Outreach Center held a trial which they called \"International Judge the Quran Day\". Jones played the part of a \"judge\", wearing traditional robes. The Quran was placed on trial for six hours, charging it with responsibility for violence. At the end of the \"trial\" the jury found the Quran guilty of all charges and \"sentenced\" to burning. Pastor Wayne Sapp then \"executed\" the Quran by burning it.\n\nJones sought a permit in April 2011 to hold a rally at the Islamic Center of America in Dearborn, Michigan. A jury sided with prosecutors, ruling that Jones and Sapp would breach the peace. Judge Mark Somers set the bond for each man at $1, which they refused to pay. Somers remanded them to jail. Jones was barred from the area of the mosque for three years.\n\nOn November 11, 2011, Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Robert Ziolkowski vacated the \"breach of peace\" ruling against Terry Jones and Wayne Sapp on the grounds that they were denied due process. Both men's criminal records have since been expunged.\n\nOn March 24 Hamid Karzai, President of Afghanistan, publicly condemned the act. Some diplomats believed that most Afghans learned of the incident through Karzai's announcement. On April 2, crowds chanted \"Death to Karzai!\" as well as \"Death to America!\" After a sermon on April 1 in the city's main mosque, at least 12 people were killed by angry demonstrators in Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan, including five Nepalese security guards and three other members of staff working for the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA). Jones denied responsibility. Pajhwok Afghan News reported that the dead included Norwegian, Romanian and Swedish nationals, two of them decapitated. BBC quoted police general, Abdul Rafu Taj, as saying that \"according to the initial reports... none were beheaded\", and that they were shot in the head. Up to 2,000 protesters took to the streets on April 2 in Kandahar, chanting anti-U.S. slogans. The protesters burned several vehicles and hurled stones at police who were trying to control the mob. They also torched a girls' high school and burned down a school bus in the centre of the city. Security forces killed nine protesters and injured 73. Smaller protests occurred in other cities.\n\nThe Gambian government has called for the arrest of Terry Jones. Ebrima O. Camara, the secretary general and head of the civil service, described the burning as \"heinous\" and asked for prosecution to proceed \"as soon as possible\".\n\nAn affiliate website of Iran's Revolution Guard Cyber Defense Command quoted a report by the newspaper \"Vatan-e Emrooz\" that claimed Iranian border patrols were burning copies of \"smuggled\" Bibles in Iran. On March 25, 2011, the Iranian Ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Khazaee, condemned the burning and called for Jones's prosecution.\n\nIn southern Lebanon, students protested peacefully with Shia sheikh Hassan al-Zayyat outside the Lebanese International University to construct the largest Quran on Earth, weighing 100 kg. Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah has put a $2.4 million bounty on the head of pastor Terry Jones, according to the FBI.\n\nOn March 22, 2011, Pakistanis protested in the Punjab Christian neighborhoods and burned tires in front of a church. On March 22, 2011, Amir Hamza, the leader of Pakistan's banned Islamic organization Jama'at-ud-Da'wah, issued a $2.2 million fatwā for anyone who kills pastor Terry Jones. On March 25, 2011, protests erupted in Pakistan, where the Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam organized province-wide protests, including a road blockage and burnings of effigies and American flags in the province of Sindh. A man desecrated the Bible at the gates of Saint Anthony's Catholic Church in Lahore to \"avenge\" Jones' desecration of the Quran in Florida; he was arrested by Pakistani police. The President of the Pakistani Bishops' Conference, His Excellency, Lawrence Saldanha, who currently serves as the Metropolitan Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Lahore, called for the arrest of Jones. Saldanha said Jones' burning of the Qu'ran has caused scandal and fury in the Muslim world and the deaths of more than 20 people. Archbishop Saldanha said the U.S. government should detain Jones.\n\nA South African Islamic organization called Scholars for Truth turned to the country's courts to prevent a fellow-Muslim from burning Bibles in retaliation to threats by Jones to burn the Quran.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama strongly condemned both the Quran burning, calling it an act of \"extreme intolerance and bigotry\", and the \"outrageous\" attacks by protesters, referring to them as \"an affront to human decency and dignity\". \"No religion tolerates the slaughter and beheading of innocent people, and there is no justification for such a dishonorable and deplorable act.\" U.S. legislators, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, also condemned both the burning and the subsequent violence. Gen. David Petraeus said, \"This was a surprise,\" and \"That action was hateful; it was intolerant.\"\n\nOn 4 April 2011, two US soldiers were shot and killed by an Afghan policeman in an attack that was attributed to his anger over the burning of the Koran. The attacker was later killed in a shootout with NATO troops. The attacker has been called a hero and a martyr by some of the local community, with his grave becoming an unofficial shrine, and local mosques being named after him. However, at least one local cleric has stated that the attack could not be justified on religious grounds.\n\n\n"}

Brace\n\nErnest Cary Brace (August 15, 1931 – December 5, 2014) was the longest-held civilian prisoner of war (POW) during the Vietnam War. A decorated Marine Corps fighter pilot and mustang, Brace was court-martialed in 1961 for attempting to fake his own death. He flew as a civilian contract pilot before being captured in Laos in 1965 while flying supplies for USAID. He spent almost eight years as a POW and upon his release received a Presidential Pardon in light of his good conduct.\n\nBrace was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1931. He enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1947 at age 15 as an aviation radar and radio technician. He earned his Pilot's Wings and his commission as a Second Lieutenant from the Aviation Cadet School, graduating in August 1951. During his tour in the Korean War (April 1952 - March 1953), he flew more than 100 missions. While assigned to Marine Attack Squadron 121 in November 1952, Second Lieutenant Brace participated in a dive-bombing attack against a Korean hydroelectric plant. Brace received surface-to-air fire as he took low-altitude reconnaissance imagery of the bombing results. He was able to fly his damaged AD-3 Skyraider clear of the Korean Peninsula, crashing in the Sea of Japan where he was rescued by \"USS Kidd\". For his courage and initiative, Brace was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nYears later, Brace (then a captain) crashed his T-28 Trojan into a cornfield near the mouth of the Choptank River near Cambridge, Maryland during a training flight on 3 January 1961. He fled the scene but turned himself in ten days later once his empty flight-suit was found hidden in vegetation. Brace faced a court-martial and was charged with deliberately crashing his aircraft and faking his death so that his wife Patricia could collect insurance money to pay off debts. Brace pleaded guilty to \"unauthorized absence\" and was acquitted of the deliberate destruction of his aircraft. The court-martial ended his military career.\n\nBrace then worked as a civilian pilot for a number of companies before flying for BirdAir, an airline contracted by the Thai Border Patrol Police. BirdAir also supported USAID interests in Southeast Asia. On 21 May 1965, he flew Royal Thai Army Sergeant Chaicharn, as well as other passengers and cargo to a dirt airstrip in the Northern Laotian village of Baum Lao in Muong Houn District. Brace's aircraft, a Pilatus PC-6 Porter, received small arms fire upon landing, rendering it incapable of taking off again. Both he and Chaicharn were immediately taken prisoner (either by the Vietnam People's Army or the Pathet Lao) and force-marched into the jungle from Boum Lao to Muong Hoc to Doi Sai, near Dien Bien Phu. Brace was held in a bamboo cage with his limbs and neck bound to prevent escape. During his captivity he was beaten, interrogated, and faced with a mock execution. He escaped 6 June 1965 for a few days before being caught stealing food from a village. Upon his return to the cage his legs were put in stocks and bolted. He escaped on 17 April 1966, and was recaptured in minutes. Next buried up to his chin for seven days, Brace hit his low point and attempted to hang himself on 10 December 1967. He was sent in October 1968 to a POW camp on the outskirts of Hanoi nicknamed The Plantation, where he met John McCain in the cell next to him. Brace re-tells his story in Season 8 of \"Locked Up Abroad\" Like Jim Bedinger, he was sequestered from other prisoners because he had been captured in Laos. Before Doug Hegdahl's early release from the captivity, Brace contacted Hegdahl to ensure the outside world knew about the prisoners captured in Laos.\n\nBrace was released on March 28, 1973, spending 7 years, 10 months and 7 days in captivity, making him the longest-held civilian POW in Vietnam. Brace had not been listed as a prisoner during the past 7 years. His wife Patricia assumed her husband was dead and she remarried; a fact Brace found out at the processing station after his release. While receiving out-patient care in Naval Medical Center San Diego, Brace met a nurse named Nancy stationed there. He married her and moved to her hometown of Klamath Falls, Oregon where he later resided. In light of Brace's time as a POW, President Gerald Ford issued him a full pardon as well as an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps. Brace, captured as a civilian, was nominated for the Prisoner of War Medal and the Purple Heart by Admiral Stockdale, the senior officer among US prisoners held during the Vietnam War. Because Department of Defense regulations prohibit civilians from receiving military awards, the nominations were denied four times. The most recent application in 2011, sent to the office of United States Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus through fellow former POW John McCain was successful. Brace commented that \"these medals are the ones no one wants to get\" as personal suffering is involved in qualifying for them.\n\nBrace worked for a few years in the late 1970s as a manager for Evergreen International Aviation, supporting aviation contracts for the United Nations in South Vietnam, Africa, and Mexico. He went on to work as an operations lead for Sikorsky Aircraft with other overseas contracts. In 2014, Klamath Community College awarded Brace an honorary associate degree in Aviation Science. The college is also considering naming their new veterans' center in his name. He died on December 5, 2014 of a pulmonary embolism.\n\n\n\n"}

Most of the events related to the fair, however, occur in the city of Aguascalientes, the state capital. The exact date of the fair varies every year but is set around April 25, the Feast Day of San Marcos. \n\nInitially the fair was tied to the \"vendimia\" (harvesting of grapes) since wine production used to be an important activity in Aguascalientes. Nowadays, it is an important tourist attraction that is heavily associated with bullfighting and cockfighting. It is estimated that seven million people visit the fair every year and as a consequence hotels are usually filled to capacity, however some locals rent out their houses to visitors and go on vacation during this time.\n\nThe San Marcos National Fair is organized by an independent foundation that oversees the governance of what happens at the fair, but is supported by the state and city governments of Aguascalientes. \n\nThe fair is host to a large range of activities, of which bullfighting and cockfighting are the most popular. Usually a concert is given by a prominent Mexican singer after a series of cockfights; this event tends to draw more attention than the fights themselves. \n\nLocated in the main fair venue are an assortment of sponsored stands and mechanical games, as well as stages where various concerts and theater plays are performed. The livestock fair and the \"charreadas\" still remain an important part of the celebration. Parties where traditional Mexican music is played (\"tamboras\") are also celebrated on the streets of Aguascalientes. Finally, a casino is licensed in downtown Aguascalientes just for the occasion.\n\nConcerts, art exhibits and other cultural events complement the fair in many locations around the state. The award ceremony of the National Award for Youth Art occurs in Aguascalientes during this time as well.\n\nThe fair was celebrated for the first time around harvest time from November 5 to November 20, 1828, as a showcase of the state's produce and livestock. During that time it was in direct competition with the fairs of Acapulco, Jalapa and San Juan de los Lagos.\n\nThe celebrations centered in the \"Parián\", a market in the city of Aguascalientes, until 1848. In 1842 the outside balustrade of San Marcos Park was built in a plot of land donated by the Catholic Church. The balustrade is of Neoclassical style and is still preserved to this day. Once San Marcos Park was completed the date of celebration was changed to April to coincide with the festivities in honor the patron saint San Marcos.\n\nConstruction of the San Marcos Plaza bullring started in 1896 and was completed in only 48 days. From that date bullfighting was included in the festivities. It was not until 1992 that the much larger Monumental Plaza de San Marcos was built, with a seating capacity of fifteen thousand people.\n\nSince 1924 the winner of the beauty pageant has been crowned \"Queen of the Fair\". In 2006, after some electoral controversy, three queens were appointed.\n\nIn 1958 the fair was elevated to the rank of \"National\" by President Adolfo López Mateos.\n\nOn April 26, 2009, the fair was canceled due to the pandemic flu virus that was afflicting certain areas of Mexico.\nThis was the first time in 181 fairs that the festivities had been canceled. \n\n"}

This takes place over the first weekend in October every year. Fun Palaces are community events, created by and for local people. They are held in a variety of locations, ranging from libraries, shopping centres, schools, parks, village squares, community halls, swimming pools, etc. The original (never built) Fun Palace was the brainchild of celebrated theatre director Joan Littlewood and architect Cedric Price. Their never-realised vision was re-interpreted for the 21st century with the Fun Palaces campaign for cultural democracy, with community-led events in many locations. The first weekend of action took place in 2014, with 138 Fun Palaces taking place across the UK and internationally and in 2015 the number rose to 142, 292 Fun Palaces in 2016, and 362 in 2017.\n\nJoan Littlewood and the architect Cedric Price came up with the idea of the Fun Palace as one building in 1961. It was their dream to build a space where people in the community could come together to celebrate arts, science and culture. Their original blueprint said:\n\nInspiration for the idea came from traditional pleasure gardens and working men's institutes, which were very much for the community as a whole. They wanted to build a radical venue which was to be a \"laboratory of fun\" or a \"university of the streets\", where visitors could go along and enjoy performances, participate in arts and craft activities or just meet up and have fun. As a result, allowing culture, science and education to be available to people from all backgrounds.\n\nThe palace was never built. Councils would not give the land, the permissions and the money just did not materialise. As such the Fun Palace became an unrealised dream. All this changed in 2013 when the first call for venues and organisation to create their own Fun Palaces locally was suggested by Stella Duffy, co-founder (with Sarah-Jane Rawlings) of the Fun Palaces organisation. On the 4 and 5 October, hundreds of Fun Palaces, supported by the Fun Palaces organisation, appeared across the UK and beyond. Instead of building new buildings, temporary 'pop-up' fun palaces, appeared in various venues and locations.\n\nDuring the first weekend, 138 venues and companies enlisted along with independent artists, scientists and community events organisers. Since then there have been annual weekends of action on the first weekend of October every year. \n\nThe Fun Palaces Manifesto is:\n"}

{"id": "1554948", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1554948", "title": "Huemul Project", "text": "Huemul Project\n\nThe Huemul Project () was an early 1950s Argentine effort to develop a fusion power device known as the Thermotron. The concept was invented by Austrian scientist Ronald Richter, who claimed to have a design that would produce effectively unlimited power.\n\nRichter was able to pitch the idea to President Juan Perón in 1948, and soon received funding to build an experimental site on Huemul Island, just outside the town of San Carlos de Bariloche in Patagonia, near the Andes mountains. Construction began late in 1949, and by 1951 the site was completed and carrying out tests. On 16 February 1951, Richter measured high temperatures that suggested fusion had been achieved. On 24 March, the day before an important international meeting of the leaders of the Americas, Perón publicly announced that Richter had been successful, adding that in the future energy would be sold in packages the size of a milk bottle and perhaps free of charge.\n\nA worldwide interest followed, along with significant skepticism on the part of other physicists. Little information was forthcoming; no papers were published on the topic, and over the next year a number of reporters visited the site but were denied access to the buildings. After increasing pressure, Perón arranged for a team to investigate the claims and return individual reports, all of which were negative. A review of these reports was equally negative, and the project was ended in 1952. By this time, the news had been used by groups around the world to begin their own fusion research projects.\n\nPerón was overthrown in 1955, and in the aftermath, Richter was arrested for fraud. He appears to have spent periods of time abroad, including some time in Libya. Eventually he returned to Argentina, where he died in 1991.\n\nAccording to Rainer Karlsch's \"Hitler's Bomb\", during World War II German scientists under Walter Gerlach and Kurt Diebner carried out experiments to explore the possibility of inducing thermonuclear reactions in deuterium using high explosive-driven convergent shock waves, following Karl Gottfried Guderley's convergent shock wave solution. At the same time Richter proposed in a memorandum to German government officials the induction of nuclear fusion through shock waves by high-velocity particles shot into a highly compressed deuterium plasma contained in an ordinary uranium vessel. The proposal was not carried through.\n\nShortly after his election in 1946, Perón began a purge of the universities that eventually resulted in well over 1,000 professors being fired or quitting, causing a serious setback in Argentine sciences, and lasting enmity between Perón and Argentine intelligentsia. In response, the Physical Association of Argentina (AFA) began to organize as a community to retain links between Argentine scientists who now spread to industry.\n\nIn 1946, the director of the AFA, physicist Enrique Gaviola, wrote a proposal to set up the \"Comisión Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas\", or National Scientific Research Commission, arguing that post-World War II friction (leading to the Cold War) would present the opportunity for various northern hemisphere scientists to move south to escape limits on their research. In the same paper, Gaviola argued for the formation of a body to explore the peaceful use of atomic power. In spite of the poor relations between the science community and government, the proposal was seriously studied and Congress debated the matters on several occasions, before Perón decided to place it under military control. Gaviola objected, starting a long and acrimonious debate over the nature and aims of the program.\n\nBy 1947 plans to form an atomic study group were progressing slowly, when the entire issue was shut down by an article in the US political newsmagazine, \"New Republic\". The 24 February 1947 issue contained an article by William Mizelle on \"Peron's Atomic Plans\", which claimed:\n\nWith world famous German atom-splitter Werner Heisenberg invited to come to Argentina by Peron's Government and with a major uranium source discovered in Argentina, that Nation is launching a military nuclear research program to crack Pandora's box of atomic energy wide open. Argentina's determined atomic adventure and its frankly military purposes cannot be dismissed as the impractical dream of a small nation.\n\nInternational pressure on the country following the publication was intense, and the plans were soon dropped. This event appears to have made Perón more determined than ever to both develop atomic energy as well as prove its peaceful intentions.\n\nIn 1947 a dossier was provided to Argentina by the Spanish embassy in Buenos Aires, listing a number of German aeronautical engineers who were looking to sneak out of the country. Among them was Kurt Tank, designer of the famed Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and many other successful designs. The dossier was passed to the recently formed Argentine Air Force's Commander in Chief, who passed it to Brigadier César Raúl Ojeda, in charge of aerodynamics research. Ojeda and Tank communicated and formulated plans to begin building a jet fighter in Argentina, which would eventually emerge as the FMA IAe 33 Pulqui II.\n\nJust before leaving for Argentina, Tank briefly met Richter in London, where Richter told Tank of his ideas for nuclear powered aircraft. Richter was at that time doing some work in the German chemical industry. Tank had also contacted a number of other engineers and even famed fighter pilot and \"Luftwaffe\" general Adolf Galland. Various members of the group made their way to Argentina under false passports during late 1947 and 1948. The Germans were warmly received by Perón, who effectively gave them a blank cheque in an effort to rapidly develop the Argentine economy. Tank set up an aircraft development plant in Córdoba, and continued to contact other German engineers and scientists who might be interested in joining them. A total of 184 German scientists and engineers were known to have moved to Argentina during this period.\n\nRichter was invited to join the group and arrived in Argentina on 16 August 1948 travelling under the name \"Dr. Pedro Matthies\". Tank personally introduced him to Perón on 24 August, and Richter pitched him on the idea of a fusion device which would provide unlimited power, make Argentina a scientific leader in the world, and be of purely civilian intent. Perón was intrigued, and clearly impressed, later telling reporters that \"in half an hour he explained to me all the secrets of nuclear physics and he did it so well that now I have a pretty good idea of the subject\".\n\nGaviola, still maintaining pressure to form a nuclear research group, saw all interest evaporate. From that point on he offered his services only as a \"member of Richter's firing squad.\" Other German scientists, including Guido Beck, Walter Seelmann-Eggbert and now-elderly Richard Gans, quickly realized something was amiss in the entire affair, and began to align themselves with the AFA, steering clear of Richter and the government in general. At an AFA meeting in September 1951, Beck publicly resigned from the University of Buenos Aires over the issue.\n\nRichter was soon set up in a laboratory at Tank's Córdoba site, but in early 1949 a fire destroyed some of the equipment. Richter claimed it was sabotage, and demanded a more protected location free from spies. When support was not immediately forthcoming, Richter went on a tour, visiting Canada and perhaps the US and Europe as well. A year later, Lise Meitner recalled meeting \"a strange Austrian with an Argentine visa\" in Vienna, where he demonstrated a device he claimed was a thermonuclear system, but Meitner later dismissed as a chemical effect.\n\nRichter's tour was a thinly veiled threat to leave Argentina, which prompted action. Perón handed the problem of selecting a suitable experimental site to Colonel González, a friend from the 1943 Argentine coup d'état. González selected a location deep within the country on Huemul Island where it would be easy to protect from prying eyes. Construction work began in July, causing a nationwide shortage of brick and cement. Richter moved to the site in March 1950 while construction on Laboratory 1, the reactor, was still ongoing.\n\nIn May 1950, Perón formed the National Atomic Energy Commission (\"CNEA\"), bypassing Gaviola's earlier efforts and placing himself in the position of president, with Richter and the minister of technical affairs as the other chairs. A year later, he formed the National Atomic Energy Directorate (\"DNEA\"), under González, to provide project assistance and logistics support.\n\nWhen the reactor was finally completed in May, Richter noticed there was no way to access the interior of the wide concrete cylinder, requiring a series of holes to be drilled through the thick walls. But before this could be completed, Richter declared that a crack on the outside rendered the entire reactor useless, and had it torn down.\n\nWhile this was taking place, Richter began experiments in the much smaller reactor in Laboratory 2. The experiments injected lithium and hydrogen into the cylinder and discharged a spark through it. The cylinder was supposed to reflect the energy created by these reactions back into the chamber to keep the reaction going. Diagnostic measurements were provided by taking photographs of the spectrum and using doppler widening to measure the temperature of the resulting reactions.\n\nOn 16 February 1951, Richter claimed he had successfully demonstrated fusion. He re-ran the experiment for members of the CNEA, later claiming that they had witnessed the world's first thermonuclear reaction.\n\nOn 23 February, a technician working for the project expressed his concerns about the claims, suggesting that the measurement was likely due to the accidental tilting of the spectrograph's photographic plate while the experimental run was being set up. Richter refused to re-run the experiment. Instead, a week later he ordered the reactor to be disassembled so a new one could be built that included a magnetic confinement system. Meanwhile, plans for a new Laboratory 1 were started with this new design, but this time to be buried underground. A deep hole in hard rock was constructed, only to have Richter change the design and have the hole filled in with concrete.\n\nOn 2 March, Edward Miller, the US Assistant Secretary of Station for Inter-American Affairs, visited Argentina. This was ostensibly to visit the Pan American Games, but in reality was in advance of calling a meeting of American leaders later that month to discuss China's entry into the Korean War. Perón gave Miller an introduction to Richter's work, and Miller filed a memo on it on 6 March. During this period, Perón seized the Argentine newspaper \"La Prensa\", whose editor fled to the US. This led to harsh criticism in the US. Miller suggested a policy of \"masterful inaction\", not actively denying support for the project, but simply never providing any.\n\nThe leadership meeting was to take place between 26 March and 7 April, by which time the Chinese \"emergency\" had passed and the war was entering a new phase. Perón then took the opportunity to announce Richter's results to the world. On 24 March, Perón held a press conference at Casa Rosada and stated that:\n\"On February 16, 1951, in the atomic energy pilot plant on Huemul Island... thermonuclear experiments were carried out under conditions of control on a technical scale.\"\nPerón justified the project by noting the country's enormous energy shortage would be addressed by building plants across the country, and that the energy would be bought and sold in containers the size of a milk bottle. He went on to note that the country was simply unable to afford the cost of developing a uranium-based energy program, or that of a system using tritium, normally generated in special fission plants. Richter's fuel meant the reaction could only take place in a reactor, not a bomb, and he then recommitted the country to exploring only peaceful uses of atomic energy. Richter added that he understood the secret of the hydrogen bomb, but that Perón had forbidden any work on it.\n\nThe next day Richter held another press conference on the topic, a meeting that became known as the \"10,000 word interview\". He explained that a hydrogen bomb required a fission trigger, and that the country was unable and unwilling to build such a device. Very little explanation of the thermotron was mentioned, beyond the announcement that he used the Doppler effect to measure speeds of 3,300 km/s and that the fuel was either lithium hydride or deuterium which was introduced into pre-heated hydrogen. He was careful to explain that these were small-scale experimental results, and refused to state whether it would work well at the industrial scale.\n\nOn 7 April, Perón awarded Richter the gold Peronista Party Medal in a highly publicized event.\n\nWith the US refusing any support for the program, Richter turned to other countries for equipment. In April, Prince Bernhard of The Netherlands visited Perón, and offered technical help to the project from Philips. A visit by Cornelis Bakker, later the director of CERN, was arranged and a synchrotron and Cockcroft–Walton generator were suggested as possible products of interest. Perón wrote to Richter to arrange the visit, during which Richter refused to show Bakker any of the reactors. In spite of this, Perón offered to fund the purchase of a Cockcroft–Walton generator and a synchrotron from the company.\n\nShortly after Richter's conference, the matter was discussed in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. They noted that the announcement revealed no details of the system of operation. They also noted that Richter claimed three key advances during experimentation, but failed to mention any of them during the conference. Finally, although the method for measuring temperature was announced, the temperature itself was not. The United States Atomic Energy Commission's (AEC) comment on the announcement was simply that \"the Argentine Government announced more than a year ago that it was planning to engage in nuclear research.\"\n\nAmerican physicists were universally dismissive of the announcement. Among the more famous responses was George Gamow, who said \"It seemed to be 95% pure propaganda, 4¾% thermonuclear reactions on a very small scale, and the remaining ¼% probably something better.\" But Edward Lawrence was not so dismissive, noting that \"There is an tendency to laugh it off as being a lot of hot air or something. Well it may be, but we don't know all, and we should make every effort to find out.\" Edward Teller put it succinctly, \"Reading one line one has to think he's a genius. Reading the next line, one realizes he's crazy.\"\n\nBritish scientists, at that time working secretly on the z-pinch fusion concept, did not rule out the possibility of small-scale reactions. George Thomson, at that time leading the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (AEA), suggested it was simply exaggerated. This opinion was mirrored by Mark Oliphant in Australia, and Werner Heisenberg and Otto Hahn in Germany. Perhaps the most biting criticism came from Manfred von Ardenne, a German physicist now working in the Soviet Union. He advised that people should ignore Richter's claims, noting that he had worked with Richter during the war and said he confused fantasy with reality.\n\nIn May, the \"United Nations World\" magazine carried a short article by Hans Thirring, the director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Vienna, and well known author on nuclear matters. He stated that \"the chances are 99 to 1 that the explosion in Argentina occurred only in the imagination of a crank or a fraud.\" When Thirring heard the announcement, he had gone searching for anyone that knew him from before he arrived in Argentina. He found that Richter had studied under Heinrich Rausch von Traubenberg in the 1930s, who described him as a peculiar eccentric, but von Traubenberg had died in 1944 so there was no way to follow up on the story. Richter's dissertation was never published, and the university in Prague burned during the war. Richter was invited to prepare a rebuttal, which appeared in the July issue. He simply dismissed Thirring as \"a typical textbook professor with a strong scientific inferiority complex, probably supported by political hatred.\"\n\nAlthough essentially dismissed by everyone in the scientific community, the Richter announcement nevertheless had a major effect on the history of controlled fusion experiments.\n\nThe most direct outcome of the announcement was its effect on Lyman Spitzer, an astrophysicist at Princeton University. Just prior to leaving for a ski trip to Aspen, Spitzer's father called and mentioned the announcement in \"The New York Times\". Spitzer read the articles and dismissed them, noting the system could not deliver enough energy to heat the gases to fusion temperatures. This led him to begin considering ways to confine a hot plasma for longer periods of time, giving the system enough time to be heated to 10 to 100 million degrees Celsius. Considering the problem of confining a plasma in a toroid pointed out by Enrico Fermi, he hit upon the solution now known as the stellarator. Spitzer was able to use the notoriety surrounding Richter's announcement to gain the attention of the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) with the suggestion that the basic idea of controlled fusion was feasible. He eventually managed to arrange a meeting with the director of the AEC to pitch the stellarator concept.\n\nResearchers in the UK had been experimenting with fusion since 1947 using a system known today as z-pinch. Small experimental devices had been built at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE, \"Harwell\") and Imperial College London, but requests for funding of a larger system were repeatedly refused. Jim Tuck had seen the work while in the UK, and introduced z-pinch to his coworkers at Los Alamos in 1950. When Tuck heard of Spitzer's efforts to gain funding, he immediately applied as well, presenting his concept as the Perhapsatron. He felt that Spitzer's claims to have a fast track to fusion were \"incredibly ambitious\". Both Spitzer and Tuck met with AEC officials in May 1951; Spitzer was granted $50,000 to build an experimental device, while Tuck was turned away empty handed. Not to be outdone, Tuck soon arranged to receive $50,000 from the director of Los Alamos instead.\n\nWhen news of the US efforts reached the UK, the researchers there started pushing for funding of a much larger machine. This time they found a much more favorable reaction from the AERE, and both teams soon began construction of larger devices. This work, through fits and starts, led to the ZETA system, the first truly large-scale fusion reactor. Compared to the small tabletop devices built in the US, ZETA filled a hangar and operated at energy levels far beyond any other machine. When news of ZETA was made public, the US and Soviets were soon demanding funding to build devices of similar scale in order to catch up with the UK.\n\nThe announcement had a direct effect on research in the USSR as well. Prior to this several researchers, notably Igor Kurchatov and I.N. Golovin had put together a development plan similar to the ones being developed in the UK. They too were facing disinterest on the part of the funding groups, which was immediately swept away when Huemul hit the newspapers.\n\nArgentine physicists were critical of the announcement, but found little interest on the part of Perón, who was still at odds with the group. But González was growing increasingly frustrated with Richter, and in February 1952 told Perón that either Richter left the project, or he did. Perón accepted González's resignation, and replaced him with his aide, Navy Captain Pedro Iraolagoitía. Iraolagoitía soon began to protest as well, finally convincing Perón to have the project investigated.\n\nInstead of calling upon the local physics community, Perón put together a team consisting of Iraolagoitía, a priest, two engineers including Mario Báncora, and young physicist José Antonio Balseiro, who was at that time studying in England and was asked to return with all haste. The team visited the site for a series of demonstrations between 5 and 8 September 1952.\n\nThe committee analyzed Richter's work and published separate reports on the topic on 15 September. Balseiro, in particular, was convinced nothing nuclear was taking place. His report critiques Richter's claims about how the system is supposed to work, especially the claims that the system was reaching the temperatures needed to demonstrate fusion; he stated that fusion reactions would require something on the order of 40 million kelvin, while the center of the electric arc would be perhaps 4,000 to 100,000 kelvin at the most. He then pointed out that Richter's radiation detectors showed large activity whenever the arc was discharged, even if there was no fuel present. Meanwhile, the team's own detectors showed low activity throughout. They reported their findings to Perón on 15 February.\n\nRichter was allowed to officially respond to the report. The government appointed physicists Richard Gans and Antonio Rodríguez to review the first report as well as Richter's response to it. This second group endorsed the findings of the first review panel and found Richter's response inadequate. On 22 November, while Richter was in Buenos Aires, a military team occupied the site. They found that many of the instruments were not even connected, and it was pronounced a fraud. Argentines jokingly referred to the affair as the \"Huele a mula\", or \"it smells like a con\".\n\nIn the period immediately after the military takeover, Balseiro wrote a proposal to create a nuclear physics institute on the mainland in nearby Bariloche using the equipment on the island. Originally known as the Instituto de Física de Bariloche, it was renamed the Instituto Balseiro in his honour in 1962.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1955, Richter was effectively under house arrest in Buenos Aires, with an offer from Perón to \"facilitate any travel he might have to make\". After Perón was deposed in September 1955, the new government arrested Richter on the night of 4 October 1955. He was accused of fraud, and spend a short time in jail. At the time, it was estimated that 62.5 million Pesos had been spent on the project, about $15 million USD ($M in 2018). A more recent estimate places the value closer to $300 million in 2003 dollars.\n\nRichter remained in Argentina for a time, but began to travel, eventually landing in Libya. He returned to Argentina and was extensively interviewed by Mario Mariscotti for his book on Huemul, which remains the most detailed account of the project. Mariscotti blames the affair primarily on Richter, who Mariscotti states was capable of great self-delusion, adding an autocratic and paranoid management style, and lack of oversight to the ills.\n\nPerón remains a controversial figure to this day, and opinions of Richter tend to be colored by how closely the author associates him with Perón. Argentine accounts often refer to Richter as an outright con man, while accounts written outside Argentina generally describe him as a misguided amateur.\n\nThe island remained closed and under military control until the 1970s, when the Army began using it for artillery target practice. In 1995 a tourist company took control of the island, and began to offer tours by boat from docks in Bariloche. The ruins of the historic facilities (at ), can be visited by tourists by boat from the port of Bariloche.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37983692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37983692", "title": "Husayn ibn Hamdan", "text": "Husayn ibn Hamdan\n\nHusayn ibn Hamdan ibn Hamdun ibn al-Harith al-Taghlibi was an early member of the Hamdanid family, who distinguished himself as a general for the Abbasid Caliphate and played a major role in the Hamdanids' rise to power among the Arab tribes in the Jazira.\n\nHusayn entered caliphal service in 895, and through his co-operation with the caliphal government, he established himself and his family as the leader of the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira, leading his troops to successful campaigns against the Qarmatians, Dulafids and Tulunids over the next few years. As one of the most distinguished generals of the Abbasid Caliphate, he rose in power and influence until 908, when he was one of the leading conspirators in the abortive coup against Caliph al-Muqtadir. Although the coup failed and Husayn was forced to flee the capital, he soon secured a pardon and served as governor in Jibal, where he again distinguished himself in military operations in south-central Iran. In ca. 911, he was appointed governor in Mosul, where he remained until rising in revolt in 914/5, for reasons that are unclear. Defeated and captured in 916, he was imprisoned in Baghdad, where he was executed in 918. Through his influence, the family rose to high offices, beginning a long period during which Mosul and the entire Jazira were ruled by the Hamdanids. His nephews, Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla, went on to establish autonomous emirates in Mosul and Aleppo respectively.\n\nHusayn was a son of the Hamdanid family's patriarch, Hamdan ibn Hamdun. His family belonged to the Banu Taghlib tribe, established in the Jazira since before the Muslim conquests. In a pattern repeated across the Abbasid Caliphate, the Taghlibi leaders took advantage of the collapse of central caliphal authority of the during the decade-long Anarchy at Samarra (861–870) to assert increasing control over their particular area, centred on Mosul. Hamdan established himself among the leading tribal leaders during this time, and led the resistance against caliphal attempts to restore direct control, even allying with the Kharijite rebels in the 880s. Finally, in 895 Caliph al-Mu'tadid launched a determined attack to recover the Jazira. Hamdan fled before the Caliph's advance and was captured after a long pursuit and thrown in prison.\n\nHusayn, however, who had been entrusted with the fortress of Ardumusht on the left bank of the Tigris, chose to surrender it instead, and offered his services to the Caliph. He managed to capture the Kharijite leader Harun al-Shari, thereby bringing an end to the Kharijite revolt in the Jazira. In exchange he secured not only a pardon for his father, but also the lifting of a tribute that the Taghlib had been forced to pay, and the right to form a regiment of 500 Taghlibi cavalry at government expense. This was a major success, laying the groundwork for his own and his family's ascent to power. In the words of the Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy, to the caliph he offered a group of experienced warriors under his own skilled and loyal leadership; to the Taghlib, and other people in the Jazira, he offered the prospect of salaries and booty; and to his own family military command and the opportunity of acquiring wealth in government services. It was in fact not as an independent tribal leader, but rather as an intermediary between government and the Arabs and Kurds of the Jazira that al-Husayn made the family fortune.\n\nHusayn led his Taghlibi regiment with distinction over the next few years. He fought against the Dulafid Bakr ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Ahmad ibn Abi Dulaf in the Jibal in 896. After 903 he played a decisive role in the campaigns of Muhammad ibn Sulayman al-Katib against the Qarmatians of the Syrian desert, where his experienced cavalry was crucial in countering the highly mobile Qarmatians. In 903 he participated in Muhammad's major victory over the Qarmatian leader al-Husayn ibn Zikrawayh, better known by his \"laqab\" of \"Sahib al-Shama\", near Hama. The Qarmatian leaders fled to the desert, but were soon captured, and brought in triumph to Baghdad. Husayn then participated as commander of the vanguard in Muhammad's 904–905 campaign that ended the Tulunid dynasty and restored Syria and Egypt to direct caliphal control. Muhammad ibn Sulayman reportedly offered him the governorship of Egypt, but Husayn refused, preferring to return to Baghdad with the enormous booty he had collected.\n\nOn his return from Egypt, in 905–906, Husayn was sent against the Banu Kalb of Syria, who had risen in revolt at the instigation of the Qarmatians. Although he drove them into the desert, the Kalbis filled up the wells as they retreated, and he was unable to follow them. As a result, the rebels were able to reach the Lower Euphrates, where they defeated another Abbasid force at al-Qadisiyya and raided the \"hajj\" caravan of the Mecca pilgrims (late 906). In the end, the forces of the central government defeated the Qarmatians and drove them to flight. On their retreat back to Syria along the Euphrates, they were attacked and annihilated by Husayn in March/April 907. Although these victories did not entirely remove the Qarmatian threat—the Qarmatians based in Bahrayn continued to remain active and raided lower Iraq—they signalled the near-eradication of the sect from Syria. Husayn then subdued the remaining Kalbi rebels between the Euphrates and Aleppo, and in 907–908 confronted and drove back into Syria the Banu Tamim who had invaded the Jazira seeking pillage, defeating them near Khunasira.\n\nBy 908, this distinguished service had established Husayn as \"one of the leading generals\" (Kennedy) in the Caliphate, and enabled him to advance his own brothers to positions of power: they received various offices, the most important of which was the award of the governorship of Mosul to Husayn's brother Abu'l-Hayja Abdallah in 905. In December 908, Husayn became involved in a palace plot to depose the new Caliph, al-Muqtadir, in favour of the older Ibn al-Mu'tazz. Along with two others, on 17 December 908 he attacked and killed the vizier al-Abbas ibn al-Hasan al-Jarjara'i, who had endorsed al-Muqtadir's accession. The conspirators then sought to kill the young caliph as well, but the latter had barricaded himself in the Hasani Palace. Ibn al-Mu'tazz was proclaimed as caliph, and Husayn went to the palace to persuade al-Muqtadir to surrender. However, the unexpected resistance of the palace servants under the chamberlains Sawsan, Mu'nis al-Fahl and Mu'nis al-Khadim, and the plotters' indecision, doomed the coup. Al-Muqtadir prevailed, and Husayn fled from Baghdad to Mosul and to Balad. He then spent some time wandering with his followers across the Jazira. The caliph sent Husayn's own brother, Abu'l-Hayja Abdallah, to pursue him, but Husayn managed to surprise and defeat him. This success encouraged him to contact the new vizier, Ali ibn al-Furat, through the mediation of his brother Ibrahim. Although he had been a leading figure in the conspiracy, and most of the other participants in the coup were executed or imprisoned, Husayn succeeded in receiving a pardon. He was not welcomed back to Baghdad, however, but appointed governor of Qumm and Kashan in the Jibal.\n\nAs governor, he aided Mu'nis al-Khadim in his campaign against the Saffarid al-Layth ibn Ali in Sijistan and Fars, and later against the former Saffarid general and rebel Subkara and his lieutenant al-Qattal. The Abbasid forces under Mu'nis al-Khadim succeeded in suppressing the rebellion by 910/1, with al-Qattal being captured by Husayn in person, according to a celebratory poem by the later Hamdanid poet Abu Firas.\n\nAbu Firas further reports that Husayn was offered the governorship of Fars, but refused, and returned to Baghdad. Ibn al-Furat, who probably still mistrusted his intentions, promptly dispatched him to the governorship of the Diyar Rabi'a, the province encompassing the eastern Jazira, including Mosul. From this post, Husayn led a raiding campaign against the Byzantine Empire in 913/4. Soon after, however, an open rift developed between Husayn and the vizier Ali ibn Isa al-Jarrah. The reason is unclear, but revolved around the finances of Husayn's province. In 914/5 he rose in open rebellion, assembling a force of 30,000 Arabs and Kurds in the Jazira, a testament to his influence there. He managed to defeat a caliphal army sent against him, but when confronted by the redoubtable Mu'nis al-Khadim, recalled from Egypt, he was defeated and captured in February 916 while trying to flee north into Armenia. He was brought to Baghdad, where he was publicly paraded across the city in ritual humiliation, riding a camel and wearing a cap of shame. He was put into prison, and executed in October/November 918 on the caliph's orders.\n\nThe reason for Husayn's execution is unclear. The historian of the Hamdanid dynasty, Marius Canard, suggested that it may have been due to his involvement in a Shi'a-inspired conspiracy, possibly connected to the dismissal of Ibn al-Furat from his second vizierate at the same period, or with the rebellion of the autonomous governor of Adharbayjan, Yusuf ibn Abi'l-Saj, whom al-Muqtadir may have suspected of ties with the imprisoned Husayn. As Canard writes, \"in any case the caliph must have feared that if Husayn were released he would once again start a revolt, either through a desire for independence or as a Shi'i. In order to avoid attempts by those (probably numerous) who desired his release to secure it by force, the caliph preferred to take a measure which put a stop to all intrigue\".\n\nDespite Husayn's rebellion and execution, the Hamdanid family continued to prosper: his brothers were soon released from captivity, and Abdallah rose to prominence by aligning himself with Mu'nis al-Khadim and sharing in the ups and downs of the court politics in Baghdad. It was Abdallah's two sons, however, al-Hasan and Ali, better known by their honorific titles Nasir al-Dawla and Sayf al-Dawla, who established the family as the ruling dynasty in the semi-independent emirates of Mosul (until 978) and Aleppo (until 1002) respectively.\n\nAccording to Canard, Husayn \"stands out more clearly than the supreme commander Mu'nis or any other military leaders\" of the period for his ability and valour, as well as for his restive and ambitious spirit. He was also singled out in being of Arab descent, an unusual case among the Caliphate's senior leaders of the period. Canard assesses him as unusually open-minded, and attuned to the ideological turmoil and ferment in the Muslim world of his time, as indicated by his contact with the Sufi mystic al-Hallaj, who dedicated a work on politics to Husayn. Indeed, according to Canard, Husayn's espousal of Shi'ism, and his participation in the abortive coup of 908, can best be seen in light of a desire—typical of Shi'a sympathisers—for a renewal of the Caliphate and the establishment of an \"ideal Muslim government\", something which the corrupt and decadent Abbasids were no longer capable of. Finally, although it fell to his brother to found the actual Hamdanid dynasty, it was Husayn who first gave his family a taste of power and glory, for which he was later celebrated in the poetry of Abu Firas.\n\n"}
{"id": "465780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=465780", "title": "Illegal logging", "text": "Illegal logging\n\nIllegal logging is the harvest, transportation, purchase or sale of timber in violation of laws. The harvesting procedure itself may be illegal, including using corrupt means to gain access to forests; extraction without permission, or from a protected area; the cutting down of protected species; or the extraction of timber in excess of agreed limits.\n\nIllegality may also occur during transport, such as illegal processing and export; fraudulent declaration to customs; the avoidance of taxes and other charges, and fraudulent certification.\n\nIllegal logging is a pervasive problem, causing enormous damage to forests, local communities, and the economies of producer countries. Despite the economic importance of trade in timber and forest products, major international timber consumer countries, such as the EU, have no legal means to halt the import of illegally sourced forest products, because the identification of illegally logged or traded timber is technically difficult. Therefore, a legal basis for normative acts against timber imports or other products manufactured out of illegal wood is missing. Scientific methods to pinpoint the geographic origin of timber are currently under development. Possible actions to restrict imports cannot meet with WTO regulations of non-discrimination. They must instead be arranged in bilateral agreements. TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network, strives to monitor the illegal trade of timber and provide expertise in policy and legal reviews.\n\nIt is estimated that illegal logging on public land alone causes losses in assets and revenue in excess of 10 billion USD annually. Although exact figures are difficult to calculate, given the illegal nature of the activity, decent estimates show that more than half of the logging that takes place globally is illegal, especially in open and vulnerable areas such as the Amazon Basin, Central Africa, Southeast Asia, the Russian Federation.\n\nAvailable figures and estimates must be treated with caution. Governments tend to underestimate the situation, given that high estimates of illegal logging may cause embarrassment as these suggest ineffective enforcement of legislation or, even worse, bribery and corruption. On the other hand, environmental NGOs publish alarming figures to raise awareness and to emphasise the need for stricter conservation measures. For companies in the forestry sector, publications making high estimates can be regarded as potentially threatening for their reputation and their market perspective, including the competitiveness of wood in comparison to other materials. However, for many countries, NGOs are the only source of information apart from state institutions, which probably clearly underestimate the true figures. For example, the Republic of Estonia calculated a rate of 1% illegally harvested timber in 2003, whereas it was estimated to reach as much as 50% by the NGO \"Estonian Green Movement\". In Latvia, the situation is comparable; anecdotal evidence points towards 25% of logging being illegal.\n\nIllegal logging contributes to deforestation and by extension global warming, causes loss of biodiversity, and undermines the rule of law. These illegal activities undermine responsible forest management, encourage corruption and tax evasion and reduce the income of the producer countries, further limiting the resources producer countries can invest in sustainable development. Illegal logging has serious economic and social implications for the poor and disadvantaged with millions of dollars worth of timber revenue being lost each year.\n\nFurthermore, the illegal trade of forest resources undermines international security, and is frequently associated with corruption, money laundering, organized crime, human rights abuses and, in some cases, violent conflict. In the forestry sector, cheap imports of illegal timber and forest products, together with the non-compliance of some economic players with basic social and environmental standards, destabilise international markets. This unfair competition affects those European companies, especially the small and medium-sized companies that are behaving responsibly and ready to play by fair rules.\n\n\n\nThe East Asia Forest Law Enforcement and Governance (EA FLEG) Ministerial Conference took place in Bali in September 2001. The Conference brought together nearly 150 participants from 20 countries, representing government, international organizations, NGOs, and the private sector. The event was co-hosted by the World Bank and the Government of Indonesia. The meeting included detailed technical discussions of forest law enforcement in relation to governance, forest policy and forest management as well as ministerial engagement.\n\nThe Conference's primary aims were to share analysis on forest law enforcement; explore priority issues of forest law enforcement, including illegal logging in the East Asia region, among senior officials from forest and related ministries, NGOs and industry representatives; and commit to action at the national and regional level.\n\nIn May 2003, the European Commission presented the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade Action Plan (EU FLEGT). This marked the beginning of a long process by which the EU aims to develop and implement measures to address illegal logging and related trade. The primary means of implementing the Plan is through Voluntary Partnership Agreements with timber producing countries. The European Union Timber Regulation was adopted in 2010 and went into effect 3 March 2013.\n\n\nA Greenpeace investigation published in May 2014 demonstrates that EU Timber Regulation is ineffective if fraudulent paperwork is accepted at face value and there is not sufficient enforcement by EU authorities.\n\nThe \"Africa Forest Law Enforcement and Governance\" (AFLEG) Ministerial Conference was held in Yaoundé, Cameroon in October 2003. The meeting drew together ministers and stakeholders from Africa, Europe and North America to consider how partnerships between producers, consumers, donors, civil society and the private sector could address illegal forest exploitation and associated trade in Africa.\n\nThe AFLEG conference, the second regional forest law enforcement and governance meeting after East Asia, resulted in endorsement of a ministerial declaration and action plan as well as a variety of informal implementation initiatives.\n\nIn 2014, the FAU-EU-FLEGT Programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations published the study \"The Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) process in Central and West Africa: from theory to practice\" to document and foster strategic reflection in partner countries already engaged in negotiating a VPA - or those who will be entering into such negotiations - by providing examples of good practices. These good practices were identified and recorded following interviews with the main stakeholders in the eight VPA countries in West and Central Africa, the European Forest Institute’s (EFI) EU FLEGT Facility and the European Commission. In 2016, the FAO-EU FLEGT Programme published an additional study, \"Traceability: a management tool for business and governments\", providing examples of good practices in the region's traceability systems, which help prevent illegal logging by tracking timber from its forest of origin throughout its journey along the supply chain.\n\nThe \"Europe and North Asia Forest Law Enforcement and Governance\" (ENA FLEG) Ministerial Conference was held in Saint Petersburg, Russia on 22–25 November 2005. In May 2004, the Russian Federation announced its intention to host the ENA FLEG process, supported by the World Bank. A preparatory conference was held in Moscow in June 2005.\n\nThe Saint Petersburg conference brought together nearly 300 participants representing 43 governments, the private sector, civil society and international organisations. It agreed to the \"Saint Petersburg Declaration on Forest Law Enforcement and Governance in Europe and North Asia\". The Declaration includes an indicative list of actions, intended to serve as a general framework for possible actions to be undertaken by governments as well as civil society.\n\nThe conference took place as the United Kingdom prepared to pass the G8 Presidency to Russia. As Valery Roshchupkin, Head of the Federal Forestry Agency of the Russian Federation, confirmed, illegal logging would be of special importance for Russia as the G8 President and for the following G8 Summit, also held in Saint Petersburg.\n\nIn response to growing concerns over illegal logging and advice from TRAFFIC and other organisations, on May 22, 2008 the U.S. amended the Lacey Act, when the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 expanded its protection to a broader range of plants and plant products (Section 8204. Prevention of Illegal Logging Practices).\n\nThe requirements under the new Amendments are two-fold. First, the Lacey Act now makes it illegal to import into the United States plants that have been harvested contrary to any applicable Federal Law, State Law, Indian Tribal Law, or Foreign Law. If a plant is found to have been harvested in violation of the laws of the country where it was harvested, that plant would be subject to seizure and forfeiture if imported into the U.S. The Lacey Act also makes it unlawful, beginning December 15, 2008, to import certain plants and plant products without a Plant and Plant Product import declaration.\n\nThis Plant and Plant Product Declaration must contain (besides other information) the Genus, Species, and Country of Harvest of every plant found in commercial shipments of certain products, a list of applicable products (along with other requirements and guidance) can be found on the USDA APHIS website.\n\nThe Timber Development Association (TDA) welcomes on June 6, 2014's release by the Australian Department of Agriculture of a position paper on the Illegal Logging Prohibition Regulation and guidance on how timber and wood products industry can comply on the Australian Government - Department of Agriculture official website. The release of the Government's guidance coincides with the release of industry developed timber due diligence tools and information through the industry website of Timber Due Diligence.\n\nThe Australian Illegal Logging Prohibition Regulation applies to importers into Australia of \"regulated timber products\" such as sawn timber, wood panels, pulp, paper products, and wood furniture. The Regulation starts on 30 November 2014 and requires that before import of these products or processing of raw logs, due diligence is undertaken to minimise the risk that the timber products or raw logs were illegally logged or incorporate illegally logged timber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48527494", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48527494", "title": "Jain festivals", "text": "Jain festivals\n\nJain festivals occur on designated days of the year. Jain festivals are either related to life events of Tirthankara or they are performed with intention of purification of soul.\n\nThere are many religious festivals in Jainism. Some of them are associated with five auspicious life events of Tirthankara known as Panch Kalyanaka.\n\n\"Paryushana Parva\" is one of the most important festival for Jains. Paryusana is formed by two words meaning ‘a year’ and ‘a coming back’. This festival comes in the months of Shravana and Bhadra (August or September). Svetambara Jains celebrate it for eight-days while Digambara Jains celebrate it for ten days. It is also known as \"Das Lakshana Parva\". It is a festival of repentance and forgiveness. Many Jains fast and carry out different religious activities. Jain monks stop walking during chaturmas and reside at one place where they lecture on various religious subjects during paryushana. This festival is believed to remove accumulated karma of the previous year and develop control over new accumulating new karma, by following Jain austerities and other rituals. There are regular rituals at the Jain temples. Discourses of Kalpa Sutra are given by monks. Kalpa Sutra describes life of Mahavira and other Tirthankaras. On the third day, procession of Kalpa Sutra is carried out. On the fifth day, auspicious dreams of Trishala, mother of Mahavira are demonstrated and after that birth of Mahavira is celebrated. The tenth day of festival is called Anant Chaurdsashi. Anant Chaturdashi is the day when Lord Vasupujya attained moksha(nirvan). Usually, a procession is taken out by Jains on this day. Kshamavani is generally observed a day after Anant Chaturdashi by digambaras,while the shwetambaras observe it after the 8th ie the last day of their paryushan.(last day is called samvatsari)\nOn Kshamavani, Jains ask for forgiveness from everybody for any acts during the previous year which may have hurt them.\n\nMahavira was born on the thirteenth day of the bright half of the Jain calendar month of Chaitra, probably 599 BCE. It falls in March or April. This festival marks birth of Mahavira. Procession is carried out and lectures on message of Mahavira is presented. The idols of Mahavira is ceremonially bathed and rocked in a cradle. Events related to birth are also recited from sacred texts by monks.\n\nDiwali is one of the most important festival in India. Mahavir attained nirvana followed by moksha on this day in 527 BCE. It falls on the last day of Ashvina month of Jain calendar. It is also the last day of Indian calendar. It comes during October or November. It is believed that the eighteen kings of northern India, followers of Mahavira, decided to light lamps (known as \"dipa\") symbolizing knowledge of Mahavira. So it is known as Deepavali or Diwali. Jains are forbidden to burst crackers.On Diwali morning, Nirvan Ladoo is offered after praying to Lord Mahavira in all Jain temples all across the world. Gautam Gandhar Swami, the chief disciple of Lord Mahavira achieved omniscience (Kevala Gyan) later the same day.\n\nAfter celebrating Diwali at the end of Ashwina, Jains celebrate new year on the first day of the following month of Kartika. Ritual of \"Snatra Puja\" is performed at the temple. Mahavira's chief disciple Gautama Swami attained keval gyan on this day.\n\nThe fifth day of Kartika is known as Gyana Panchami. It is considered knowledge day. On this day holy scriptures are displayed and worshipped.\n\nIt is celebrated on 10th day of dark half of Pausha (Pushya) month of Hindu calendar(December/January). It marks Janma Kalyanaka (Birth) of 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanath. Eight days fast known as \"Attham\" is observed by many Jains.\nIt is believed that the first Jain Tirthankara Rishabhdev completed of an austerity on 3rd day of the bright fortnight of Vaishakh month of Jain calendar after fasting for 13 months and 13 days continuously. People who performed austerity known as \"Varshi tapa\" regarding these event complete the austerity on this day by taking sugar-cane juice.\n\nMaun Agiyaras or Ekadashi marks Kalyanaka of many Tirthankaras. It is celebrated on 11th day of Magshar month of Jain calendar(October/November). On this day, complete silence is observed and fasting is kept. Meditation is also performed.\n\nThe nine-day \"Oli\" is a period of semi-fasting. During these period Jains take only one meal a day of very plain food. It comes twice a year during March/April and September/October.\n\n\"Mahamastakabhisheka\" is a festival held once every twelve years in the town of Shravanabelagola, Karnataka. It is held in veneration of an immense 18 meter high statue of Bahubali. The last anointing took place in February 2018, and the next ceremony will occur in 2030.\n\nRoth Teej is celebrated on Bhadrapada Shukla Tritiya. On Roth Teej, the Jains are supposed to eat only one type of grain food, roth, once during the day. The festival is a reminder that material wealth is not important, only relinquishment leads to true happiness.\n\nAkshaya Tritiya is celebrated to commemorate Lord Adinath's ending of one-year fast by consuming sugarcane juice poured into his cupped hands.\n\nShrut Panchami is celebrated by Jains every year in the month of May commemorating Acharya Pushpadanta and Bhutabali.\n\n\n"}

Her death in childbirth in 1817 set off a race between the Prince Regent's brothers, the six surviving younger sons of King George III, to see who could father a legitimate heir. Some of the brothers had been previously involved in scandals. Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, the second in line to the throne, was amicably separated from his wife, Princess Frederica Charlotte of Prussia. The sixth son, Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, had contracted two marriages in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 (as had the Prince Regent before his marriage to Charlotte's mother). Three brothers, the third, fourth and seventh in line to the throne, married in 1818: Prince William, Duke of Clarence; Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn; and Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge. The fifth son, Prince Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, was already married.\n\nThe Duke of Clarence married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen. Though he had been able to father ten illegitimate children with an earlier mistress, none of his children by his wife survived childhood. The second daughter, Elizabeth, lived the longest, being born on 10 December 1820 and dying on 4 March 1821. The next son to produce an heir was the Duke of Cambridge, whose son George was born on 26 March 1819. He would be displaced two months later by the birth of a daughter to the Duke of Kent and his wife. Their first and only child was called Princess Alexandrina Victoria but was known to her family as \"Drina\". She was born on 24 May 1819, just three days before the son of the Duke of Cumberland, also called George.\n\nBoth George III and the Duke of Kent died in January 1820. The Prince Regent became George IV and Drina was third in line to the throne after her uncles, the Duke of York and Duke of Clarence (the future William IV). She would ultimately take the throne as Queen Victoria in 1837.\n\nRumours about Victoria's parentage centred on a controversial Irish soldier and adventurer called Sir John Conroy who was her mother's private secretary and the comptroller of her household. The Duchess of Kent was the same age as Conroy, whereas she was nineteen years younger than her husband; the court gossiped openly about their relationship. After the Duke's death Conroy assumed a parental role towards Victoria that she bitterly resented. This caused a near permanent rift between Victoria and her mother, as well as between the Duchess and her brother-in-law, William IV. Conroy expected that when Victoria became queen he would be made her private secretary, but instead one of her first acts as monarch was to dismiss him from her household.\n\nThe belief that the Duchess and Conroy were lovers was widespread. When asked by Charles Greville whether he believed they were lovers, the Duke of Wellington replied that he \"supposed so\". The Duke later recounted a story that when Victoria was young she had caught Conroy and the Duchess engaged in what were diplomatically called \"some familiarities\". Wellington reported that she told Baroness Louise Lehzen, who told her close ally, Madame de Späth, who confronted the Duchess about her behaviour. According to Wellington, the Duchess of Kent was furious and promptly dismissed de Späth. Victoria, when queen, appears to have disputed the story, stating that her mother's piety would have prevented any undue familiarity with Conroy.\n\nA. N. Wilson suggested that Victoria's father could not have been the Duke of Kent for two reasons:\n\nBoth arguments can be countered. Since hæmophilia is X-linked, in order for a father to transmit the condition he must have it himself, but Conroy was healthy. Hæmophiliacs were unlikely to survive in the early nineteenth century, given the poor state of medicine at the time. Indeed, life expectancy was 11 years or younger, even into the later half of the twentieth century, and is still as low in developing countries. Nor is there evidence of hæmophilia in either Conroy's ancestors or descendants, or any mention of any hæmophiliacs in any document associated with the Kents. It is likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because the Duke of Kent was in his 50s when Victoria was conceived; hæmophilia-causing mutations arise more frequently in the children of older fathers, and spontaneous mutations account for about 30% of cases.\n\nWith regard to porphyria (which famously George III may have had), there is no genetic evidence that the royal family even had the disease and its diagnosis in George III's case (and others) has been questioned. If the diagnosis of hereditary porphyria is correct, it may have continued among descendants of Victoria. At least two of her descendants, Charlotte, Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen, and Prince William of Gloucester are suspected of having suffered from it.\n\nConcrete evidence on the origins of the hæmophilia disease and paternity of Victoria could be achieved with a DNA test of her or her parents' remains, but no such study has been sanctioned by the Royal Family.\n\n"}

{"id": "244074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=244074", "title": "Moment of silence", "text": "Moment of silence\n\nA moment of silence is a period of silent contemplation, prayer, reflection, or meditation. Similar to flying a flag at half-mast, a moment of silence is often a gesture of respect, particularly in mourning for those who have died recently or as part of a tragic historical event. It is also sometimes referred to as a minute's silence or a one-minute silence.\n\nSilent prayer, including moments of silence practiced during other group activities, have been practised by Quakers for more than 300 years. Since silence contains no statements or assumptions concerning beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret, it is more easily accepted and used than a spoken prayer or observance when persons of different religious and cultural backgrounds participate together. In the colonial period Pennsylvania Quakers and Americans worshipped silently together on occasions, yet both groups thought that this implied that they had altered their traditional belief system in doing so. Over time, the effectiveness of Quaker-style silence for non-sectarian and non-controversial public observances has led to its almost universal use in the English-speaking world as well as other plural societies. This is also the case within many institutions where diverse groups are expected to participate but not necessarily share beliefs such as in government, schools, businesses and the military.\n\nOne minute is a common length of time for the commemoration, though other periods of time may be chosen, normally connected in some way with the event being commemorated (there might be a minute given for every death commemorated, for example). During the moment of silence, participants may typically bow their heads, remove hats, and refrain from speaking or moving for the duration.\n\nMany people in the Commonwealth observe the two-minute silence at 11:00am on November 11 each year (Armistice Day) to remember sacrifices of members of the armed forces and of civilians in times of war.\n\nIn Israel, moments of silence are held in memory of the victims of the Holocaust and on Jewish holidays in memory of fallen soldiers and terrorist victims. The moment of silence are marked as a time to live peacefully with other countries.\n\nMoments of silence are often observed prior to sports matches with reasons for silences range from national and international tragedies, to the death of individuals connected to the sport or specific clubs.\n\nThe first recorded instance of an official moment of silence dedicated to a person's death took place in Portugal on February 13, 1912. The Portuguese Senate dedicated 10 minutes of silence to José Maria da Silva Paranhos Júnior, baron of Rio Branco, Brazil, and Minister of the Exterior of the Brazilian government, who had died three days earlier on February 10. This moment of silence was registered in the Senate's records of that day. In the same year, large parts of the US kept a ceremonial silence to honour the dead of the Maine and the Titanic.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that official organization, sponsorship, or endorsement of school prayer is forbidden by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution in public school. Teachers and school officials may not lead classes in prayer, but prayer is permitted at voluntary religious clubs, and students are not prohibited from praying themselves. Other rulings have forbidden public, organized prayer at school assemblies, sporting events, and similar school-sponsored activities.\n\nPublic moments of silence in the United States both arise from and contribute to this debate over prayer and the separation of church and state. A moment of silence lacks any specific religious formulation, and therefore it has been presented as a way of creating reflection and respect without endorsing any particular sect.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan was a supporter of a moment of silence in American schools. In 1981 Reagan formally proposed a constitutional amendment permitting organized prayer in public schools. In his 1984 state of the union address, Reagan asked congress, who begin their day with an invocation: \"If you can begin your day with a member of the clergy standing right here leading you in prayer, then why can't freedom to acknowledge God be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land?\"\nThe Lubavitcher rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson was a strong advocate of a moment of silence every morning in public schools. Citing the many polls as proof that it reduces crime.\nColin Powell, a longtime advocate, has recommended a simple moment of silence at the start of each school day. Further, he states that students could use this interval to pray, meditate, contemplate or study.\n\nHowever, critics often view the moment of silence as publicly endorsing prayer \"in disguise\". This issue has been especially raised by atheists groups and advocates, who argue that no non-religious purpose is served by designating an official moment of silence. They point out, for example, that many schools have entire class periods dedicated to silent study, which can equally be used for silent prayer or meditation. Moments of silence point to the tension in the U.S. Constitution and society between accommodation and endorsement. Accommodation of religion is to ensure an environment where a person or student can practice their religion. A question with \"moments of silence\" laws is whether accommodation was already achieved by the fact that a student can pray or meditate on his/her own without an official moment of silence. Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State said, on a \"moment of silence\" case, \"Students were already allowed to pray, meditate, or reflect under the statute before it was amended. The addition of the word 'pray' where it wasn't needed clearly shows that legislators intended to promote religion, and that's not their job.\" Courts have stated on these moments of silence cases that a secular purpose is necessary and according to \"Wallace v. Jaffree\", a \"statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion.\"\n\nAlthough since 1976 the state Virginia law permitted school districts to implement 60 seconds of silence at the start of each school day, in 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an Alabama \"moment of silence or voluntary prayer\" law was unconstitutional, in the case \"Wallace v. Jaffree\". In April 2000, a new law came into being; requiring all Virginian public school students to observe a moment of silence. Also, in 2005, a law was passed in Indiana requiring all public schools to give students a chance to say the pledge of allegiance and observe a moment of silence every day. In October 2007, Illinois enacted legislation to require public schools to provide students with a moment of silence at the start of the school day, a statute that is currently being challenged in Illinois state courts. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia also require such moments of quiet in the classroom. In more than 20 other states, teachers are allowed to decide whether they want such a classroom time-out.\n\nIn October 2000, the U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton ruled that the \"moment of silence\" law was constitutional. Judge Hilton stated, \"The court finds that the Commonwealth's daily observance of one minute of silence act is constitutional. The act was enacted for a secular purpose, does not advance or inhibit religion, nor is there excessive entanglement with religion... Students may think as they wish – and this thinking can be purely religious in nature or purely secular in nature. All that is required is that they sit silently.\" His ruling was upheld in the 4th circuit. There is disagreement though with the law being enacted though for a secular purpose because of statements made by supporters of the legislation. State Senator Charles R. Hawkins (R-Pennsylvania) stated the moment of silence is \"a very small measure to address a very large problem.\" He also said, \"Prayer is not a bad word in my vocabulary.\" Kent Willis, Executive Director of the ACLU of Virginia, stated lawmakers are \"at the very least placing Virginia law right on the line of separation of church and state or they are crossing it . . . the state is playing with fire here.\"\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union was opposed to a proposed constitutional amendment by Newt Gingrich in the early 1990s which would have set aside a voluntary moment of prayer during the school day, which was later independently described by President Bill Clinton as a \"moment of silence\". They considered this stealth endorsement of prayer in school.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56693259", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56693259", "title": "Murder of Ján Kuciak", "text": "Murder of Ján Kuciak\n\nJán Kuciak (17 May 1990 – 21 February 2018) was a Slovak investigative journalist. Kuciak worked as a reporter for the news website Aktuality.sk, focused mainly on investigating tax fraud of several businessmen with connections to top-level Slovak politicians. He and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, were shot dead in February 2018 in their home in Veľká Mača, Galanta District, Slovakia.\n\nKuciak was the first journalist murdered in Slovakia since the country's independence. The murders caused shock and disbelief throughout the country, sparking mass popular protests and a political crisis, with the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico on one side, and President Andrej Kiska and opposition parties on the other. The crisis culminated on 15 March with the resignation of Prime Minister Fico and his entire cabinet. \n\nIn September 2018, Slovak police stated that Kuciak was murdered because of his investigative work, and that the murder had been ordered. They arrested eight suspects, charging three of them with first-degree murder.\n\nJan Kuciak was born on 17 May 1990 in the village of Štiavnik in Bytča District. He studied and graduated with a masters degree in journalism at the University of Constantine the Philosopher in Nitra, where he continued his studies as a post-graduate student in the field of mass media communication. While working on his PhD, he also held a teaching position at the same faculty.\n\nHe later started to work for the newspaper \"Hospodárske noviny\", before taking up a position in the editorial office of Aktuality.sk, primarily as an investigative journalist. He focused in particular on tax evasion, including cases related to the ruling Direction - Social Democracy party headed by Prime Minister Robert Fico. He had previously written about companies with unclear ownership as well as suspected systemic embezzlement from European Union funds.\n\nIn the last article published before his death, on 9 February 2018, he wrote about businessman Marián Kočner, who first became known in Slovakia in 1998 due to his unsuccessful attempt to take over the private television news network TV Markíza with the help of the State Intelligence Service (SIS). Kuciak had previously detailed in his articles how Kočner was involved in an elaborate VAT tax fraud scheme. According to Kuciak's investigation, Kočner was buying and selling luxury apartments to himself, sometimes at the symbolic rate of €1, defrauding the state of substantial tax revenue. Kočner then allegedly began to threaten Kuciak and his family. Kuciak filed a criminal complaint against Kočner in September 2017, but according to Kuciak, no police officer was assigned to the case in 44 days since the complaint was made.\n\nAt the time of his death, Kuciak was 27 years old. He lived in the village of Veľká Mača, about 65 km (40 miles) east of the capital Bratislava. On the morning of 26 February, police were called to his home by family members after the couple had not answered phone calls for more than four days. Kuciak's fiancée, Martina Kusnirova, usually spoke with her mother on a daily basis. Her mother stated that she last spoke with her daughter in the afternoon of 21 February. When she tried to contact her again that evening, there was no reply. The family stated that Kusnirova's cellphone appeared to switch off three days later, probably due to a dead battery. \n\nPolice entering the house found Kuciak and Kušnírová shot dead. Kuciak had been shot twice in the chest, while Kušnírová had been shot once in the head from the front. Both were shot at close range with a 9 mm caliber handgun. There was no evidence of a struggle and nothing appeared to have been stolen. Police found two empty cartridges at the crime scene as well as several unused bullets. The murders were initially believed to have been committed sometime between February 22 and 25, but were subsequently suspected to have taken place in the evening of February 21.\n\nThe murders sent shockwaves throughout Slovakia. The day after the news broke, gatherings were held around the country in tribute. Candles were lit at the Slovak National Uprising Square in Bratislava and in front of the editorial office of Aktuality.sk, where Kuciak worked. Similar gatherings were also organised in the Czech cities of Prague and Brno. President Andrej Kiska stated that he was \"shocked and horrified that something like this happened in Slovakia\". The President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, called on Slovakia to launch a thorough investigation, offering international support if needed, adding that \"the European Parliament will not rest until justice is done\". Ringier Axel Springer, the parent company of Aktuality.sk, called the murders a \"cruel assassination\", vowing to redouble their journalistic efforts.\n\nOn Friday, 2 March, up to 25,000 people protested in Bratislava against the attacks. On 9 March, protests were held in 48 towns and cities in Slovakia as well as 17 other cities around the world. In Bratislava alone, about 60,000 people held a protest march, the biggest turnout of any demonstration since the Velvet Revolution in 1989. The protests were endorsed by several universities in Slovakia and the Czech Republic, teachers, school associations, artists and non-governmental organisations. 21 universities cancelled afternoon lectures to allow students and employees to attend the protests. \n\nTwo days after Prime Minister Fico's resignation, an even larger demonstration was held in Bratislava with over 65,000 people participating under slogans such as \"Enough of Smer\" and \"Early elections\". Former Speaker of Parliament and ex-presidential candidate František Mikloško made an impassioned speech during the protest saying that \"the revolution started by the parents has to be finished by their children\". He argued that only twice in the history of post-war Czechoslovakia have popular protests managed to make the government resign: in November 1989 and now, adding that \"when somebody tries to abuse their power in the future, they should remember March 2018 and the mass protests\". Mikloško's speech was accompanied by the ringing of keys, reminiscent of the Velvet Revolution in 1989.\n\nIn a press conference the same morning, Slovak Police President Tibor Gašpar stated that the murders \"likely have something to do with [Kuciak’s] investigative activities\". The Government of Slovakia offered €1 million for information leading to the murderers. Prime Minister Robert Fico made the announcement during a press conference with Interior Minister Robert Kaliňák and Police President Tibor Gašpar. During the press conference, described by critics as \"surreal\" and \"bizarre\", they displayed packs of banknotes amounting to one million euros, which the government promised to give to anyone who came forward with relevant information that could help explain the murder. Furthermore, Prime Minister Fico announced the creation of an inter-agency task force involving employees of the General Prosecutor’s Office, Special Prosecutor’s Office, the Interior Ministry and the SIS in attempting to solve the case.\n\nAt the time of his murder, Kuciak was working on a report about Slovak connections with the Italian organized crime syndicate 'Ndrangheta. He had previously reported on organized tax fraud involving businesspeople close to the ruling Smer-SD party. On 28 February, Aktuality.sk published Kuciak's last, unfinished story. The article details the activities of Italian businessmen with ties to organised crime who have settled in eastern Slovakia, and have spent years embezzling European Union funds intended for the development of this relatively poor region, as well as their connections to high-ranking state officials, such as Viliam Jasaň, a deputy and the Secretary of the State Security Council of Slovakia, or , a former nude model who became Chief Adviser of Prime Minister Robert Fico. Both Jasaň and Trošková took leave of absence on the same day, stating that they would return to their positions once the investigations were concluded. \nOn 1 March, four days after the discovery of the murders, heavily armed units from the Slovak Police Corps' elite National Crime Agency (NAKA) raided several locations in eastern Slovakia, in the cities of Michalovce and Trebišov. Antonino Vadalà, an Italian businessman mentioned in Kuciak's report, was detained along with his two brothers Sebastiano and Bruno, as well as his cousin Pietro Caprotta and several other men of Italian origin. All the detained men were released from custody after 48 hours, due to lack of sufficient evidence. On the day of the arrests, General Prosecutor Jaromír Čižnár ordered the police to give no further updates to the press or the public regarding the investigation. Vadala was rearrested on 13 March, this time due to an international warrant issued by the Italian police. According to the arrest warrant, Vadala is suspected of drug trafficking as well as money laundering. Among other offences, he was said to have been planning to import large quantities of cocaine from South America. On 23 April, Slovakia approved Italy's request for extradition.\n\nAs a result of their investigation into the murder, the Slovak police stated that Kuciak had been murdered because of his work as an investigative journalist, and that the murder had been ordered. In late September 2018, eight suspects were arrested, though the police suggested that the person who had ordered the killing was not among them, and is unknown. Three of those arrested were later charged with first-degree murder.\n\nThe same day the murder was announced, Prime Minister Fico called on the political opposition not to \"exploit\" the situation. Meanwhile, a number of opposition politicians accused the ruling Smer-SD party of indirect involvement. Member of Parliament Veronika Remišová, from the opposition OĽaNO party, compared the killings to the infamous murder of Róbert Remiáš, a police officer who was assassinated in 1996, in an act widely believed to have been a contract killing by the Slovak mafia on the orders of Prime Minister Vladimír Mečiar. On 27 February, Freedom and Solidarity and OL'aNO demanded the resignation of Interior Minister Robert Kaliňák and Police President Tibor Gašpar. \n\nThe crisis escalated on 4 March when President Kiska made a live broadcast on state television, warning the government against further polarising the country. He called for either a \"radical cabinet reshuffle\" or a snap election. The president's speech infuriated Fico, who accused Kiska of \"joining the opposition\". Furthermore, he accused the president of conspiring with Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros in the planning of a coup d'etat, based on the fact that President Kiska met with Soros at Soros' apartment in New York City in September 2017, ostensibly to discuss issues related to the Roma minority.\n\nOn 28 February, two days after the news of Kuciak's murder broke, Minister of Culture Marek Maďarič announced his resignation. Announcing his decision to the press, Madaric stated that \"as a culture minister, I can't cope with the fact that a journalist was killed during my tenure.\" Robert Kaliňák, Minister of the Interior and Deputy Prime Minister, resigned on 12 March 2018 after weeks of mounting pressure. The Most-Hid party, the junior coalition partner in the government, had demanded the resignation of Kalinak in exchange for continued support of Smer-SD. The next day, Most-Hid joined the calls for snap elections, announcing that it would leave the government if it failed to reach a deal with its two coalition partners, Smer-SD and the Slovak National Party (SNS). Most-Híd Chairman, Béla Bugár, announced the decision after an eight-hour session of the Most-Hid Republican Council, the party's decision-making body.\n\nOn 14 March, following a meeting with President Kiska, Prime Minister Fico announced that he would resign as Prime Minister to avoid early elections and \"solve the political crisis\". During the meeting, Fico laid out a number of specific conditions to be met by the President in order for him to resign, including that the result of the 2016 Slovak parliamentary election be respected, that the current ruling government coalition must continue, and that Smer-SD, as the largest party in parliament, would name the next Prime Minister. Fico stated that he already had a candidate in mind, widely reported in Slovak media as Deputy Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini. On 15 March, President Kiska formally accepted the resignation of Fico and his cabinet, and tasked Pellegrini with the forming of a new government.\n\n"}

It is one of the band's biggest hits, and was released as the second single from the band's 1992 debut studio album, \"Core\".\n\nThe song's chord structure was inspired by Robert DeLeo's love of ragtime music, and its lyrics were loosely based on a newspaper article Scott Weiland had read about a girl who had been found dead after having been kidnapped in the early 1990s. Weiland had also said that the song's lyrics are a metaphor for a failed relationship.\n\nThe song was released in 1992 as \"Core\"'s second single and became a major rock radio hit in the U.S., peaking at #1 on the Album Rock Tracks and #9 on the Modern Rock Tracks. The song was also one of the first alternative rock songs to reach the #1 spot on the Album Rock Tracks chart during height of the alternative rock/grunge scene. \"Plush\" won in the category of \"Best Hard Rock Performance\" at the 1994 Grammy Awards. The music video also earned the band an MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist in 1993. \"Plush\" remains one of the biggest rock hits of the 1990s, and is still commonly heard on radio stations today. The song also was voted #12 on the Australian annual music poll Triple J Hottest 100 in 1993. In 2004, this song was featured in \"\" soundtrack on . The song also appeared as a playable song in the music video games \"Rock Band 3\" and \"\" in addition to the VH1 series \"Hindsight\".\n\nThe award-winning music video, directed by Josh Taft, was released in 1993 and had heavy rotation on MTV. It combines a visual interpretation of the song's lyrics with footage of a red-haired Weiland singing with the band as a lounge act in an empty bar. There are two different versions of this video, with minor but very noticeable differences. For example, in the version that appears on the \"Thank You\" Bonus DVD, the last shot of the video is a woman looking at a mirror image of herself and viewing her whole body while the mirror image drifts away. In another version, she's looking at a mirror image of her face, with water (possibly rain) dripping down the reflection of the mirror.\n\nWeiland and Stone Temple Pilots guitarist Dean DeLeo performed an impromptu acoustic version of \"Plush\" on the MTV show \"Headbangers Ball\" in 1992. The recording was originally only available on a CD single from the United Kingdom for their single, \"Creep\", and on the German promotional radio release \"Plush (unplushed)\", but it was not officially released anywhere else until it appeared on the band's 2003 \"greatest hits\" compilation, \"Thank You\", alongside the original studio recording. Like its original version, it also became a big hit to rock and alternative radio stations in 2003 (despite not charting on any U.S. or international charts) although it had moderate airplay when the original version had heavy airplay on radio at the time. A rare first take of the same acoustic version on MTV's Headbangers Ball was also available, but it was only found as a B-side to the rare \"Crackerman\" single. This version was notable for being a longer version of the one which appeared on \"Thank You\". It has the same length and processing as the original electric version, and also uses the last part of the original electric version. Although most radio stations play the original acoustic version, few radio stations also managed to play the rare acoustic version.\n\n\n"}

While the first film dealt with her meeting with John Smith and the arrival of the British settlers in Jamestown, the sequel focuses on Pocahontas's journey to England with John Rolfe to negotiate for peace between the two nations, although her death is omitted from the film's ending.\n\nIn London, John Smith is ambushed by a group of soldiers with a warrant for his arrest and presumed dead in the ensuing confrontation; Governor Ratcliffe has lied to King James (being a personal friend of the King) and framed Smith as the traitor from the first film in a plot to declare war against the Powhatan Nation and get ahold of the gold he still believes them to possess, all while avoiding punishment for his own crimes. In order to prevent this, the King sends a young diplomat, John Rolfe, to bring Chief Powhatan to England for negotiations. In the New World, Pocahontas, Powhatan's daughter, mourns John Smith's death but is eventually able to move on. John Rolfe soon arrives, greeted by English civilians (who by now have settled in Jamestown) and a curious Pocahontas. Rolfe eventually speaks with Powhatan, but he refuses to accompany him to England, so Pocahontas goes in her father's stead, believing that she can bring about peace between the two nations. Powhatan sends a bodyguard, Uttamatomakkin (Uti) to accompany Pocahontas. Rolfe and Pocahontas have a rocky start, but gradually warm up to each other.\n\nIn England, Rolfe leaves Pocahontas at his mansion and meets with King James and Queen Anne, but James refuses to meet with Pocahontas despite Rolfe's pleas. Instead, per Ratcliffe's suggestion, James invites both Rolfe and Pocahontas to an upcoming ball and promises that if Pocahontas impresses him by acting \"civilised\", he will prevent the armada from sailing to Jamestown, but if she does not, he will declare war. Knowing that Ratcliffe deliberately manipulated the King, Rolfe and his maid, Mrs. Jenkins, educate Pocahontas in the ways of British etiquette to prepare her. At the ball, Pocahontas wins over the King and Queen with flattery and almost manages to prevent war, but a bear-baiting arranged by Ratcliffe and greatly enjoyed by the snobbish nobility infuriates Pocahontas and she openly accuses the King of savage behaviour. James angrily orders Pocahontas and Uti imprisoned in the Tower of London, and declares war on the Powhatan tribe.\n\nAt his home, a despondent Rolfe is approached by a hooded stranger who helps him break Pocahontas and Uti out of the tower and take them to an inn, where the man reveals himself to be John Smith. Smith implores Pocahontas to stay hidden with him, but she instead takes Rolfe's advice and decides to try and stop the war one last time. She openly confronts the King in the palace and reveals Smith, thus proving that Ratcliffe had been lying the entire time. Realizing Ratcliffe's treachery, James sends a battalion (consisting of Pocahontas, Smith, Rolfe, Uti, and their animal friends) to stop the armada. They are successful in stopping the ships before they can set sail, but Ratcliffe refuses to give up and tries to kill Pocahontas. Smith appears and fights Ratcliffe one-on-one until Ratcliffe draws a gun, but before he can fire, Rolfe sends him overboard with the ship's mast. Ratcliffe makes it back to the port, where he is arrested by the King.\n\nSmith receives a royal pardon and his own ship from the King as a sign of apology. Pocahontas and Rolfe, meanwhile, appear on the verge of admitting that they love each other. Before they can, Smith appears and implores Pocahontas to accompany him on his new journeys around the world, but Pocahontas chooses otherwise and she and Smith part ways as friends. As Pocahontas later prepares to return to Jamestown, she finds Rolfe waiting for her on the ship, having chosen to go and live with her in Jamestown (with Uti remaining in London in his stead). They kiss as the ship sails into the sunset.\n\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 29% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 4.4/10. David Keyes from \"Cinemaphile\" rated the movie with 3/4 saying: \"Normally, I'd refuse to review such a sequel, but this attention must be paid here, because the original \"\"Pocahontas\" movie was not that great. Usually, a Disney sequel jumps back a step or two from its predecessors, as it did with \"Aladdin\". \"Pocahontas II: Journey To A New World\"\" does not–it stays at the same level of the original, by creating entertaining and colorful new characters which have usually been the best things about Disney animated movies.\" Keyes went on to criticize the historical inaccuracy of the film. \"The Movie Report\" rates the movie with 2 out of 4 stars writing: \"While \"Journey to a New World\" is the best of the crop of Disney's direct-to-video animation sequels, it's still a slapdash effort, with none of gorgeous colors and animation of the first film, and little of its emotional resonance.\"\n\nThe soundtrack of the movie was released on November 23, 2009, from the Walt Disney Records.\n\n"}

It is situated in a high valley in the Golan Heights at an elevation of 1,010 metres (3,313 feet) above sea level. Since 1974, pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 350 and the Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria, the city is inside the UN-patrolled the buffer zone.\n\nQuneitra was founded in the Ottoman era as a way station on the caravan route to Damascus and subsequently became a garrison town of some 20,000 people. In 1946, it became part of the independent Syrian Republic within the Riff Dimashq Governorate and in 1964 became the capital of the split Quneitra Governorate. On 10 June 1967, the last day of the Six-Day War, Quneitra came under Israeli control. It was briefly recaptured by Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but Israel regained control in its subsequent counter-offensive. The city was almost completely destroyed before the Israeli withdrawal in June 1974. Syria had refused to rebuild the city and actively discouraged resettlement in the area. Israel was heavily criticized by the United Nations for the city's destruction, while Israel has also criticized Syria for not rebuilding Quneitra. During the Syrian Civil War, Quneitra became a clash point between rebel forces and Syrian Arab Army. , it became controlled by the Syrian opposition.\n\nIn 2004, its population was estimated at 153 persons, with some 4,000 more living in the surrounding areas of the former city. \n\nBetween 2014 and July 2018 Quneitra was \"de facto\" controlled by the Southern Front. By the end of July, 2018, Syrian Government forces regained control over the city.\n\nQantara is the Arabic word for arched bridge. Quneitra means small arch or bridge, and the name is derived from the small-arches bridge around which the town has been built.\n\nQuneitra is the capital of the Quneitra Governorate, a district of southwestern Syria that incorporates the whole of the Golan Heights. The city of Quneitra is within the portion of the Golan Heights controlled by Syria. Madinat al-Baath (Baath City), also known as New Quneitra, replaced Quneitra as the administrative centre of Quneitra Governorate.\n\nQuneitra is situated in a high valley in the Golan Heights at an altitude of above sea level. It is overshadowed to the west by the Israeli-held portion of the Golan Heights and the peak of Har Bental. The surrounding area is dominated by ancient volcanic lava flows interspersed by a number of dormant volcanic cones which rise some above the surrounding plain. The volcanic hills of the region have played a key role as observation points and natural firing positions in the conflicts over the region, most notably in the Yom Kippur War. In more peaceful times, the fertile volcanic soil has supported agricultural activities such as wheat growing and pastoralism.\n\nWriting during the inter-war period, the American traveller Harriet-Louise H. Patterson recorded that Quneitra was\n\nThe city's position on an important trade route gave it a varied population for much of its history. By the start of the 20th century it was dominated by Muslim Circassians from the Caucasus, accompanied by Turkmen and Arabs. Its population grew to some 21,000 people, mostly Arabs, followed by Turkmen and Circassians, following Syrian independence from France in 1946. After its abandonment in 1967 and subsequent destruction, its population was dispersed to other parts of Syria. The city remains abandoned apart from a residual Syrian security presence. Due to frequent and large population movements within Syria and across borders caused by war, there are no reliable population estimates available post-2011. The impact of the crisis has led to massive displacements and a gradual deterioration of access to basic services. Quneitra has also been the destination for many internally displaced persons (IDPs) from neighbouring Daraa and Rif Dimashq governorates. In August 2013, many of the estimated 75,000 IDPs from Nawa and Al-Harra in Daraa Governorate reportedly fled to Quneitra.\n\n </ref>\nThe surrounding area has been inhabited for millennia. Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers are thought to have lived there, as evidenced by the discovery of Levallois and Mousterian flint tools in the vicinity.\n\nA settlement was established at least as early as the late Hellenistic period, and continued through the Roman and Byzantine times; it was known by the name \"Sarisai\". The settlement served as a stop on the road from Damascus to western Palestine. Saint Paul is said to have passed through the settlement on his way from Jerusalem to Damascus. The site of the Conversion of Paul was traditionally identified with the small village of Kokab, north-east of Quneitra, on the road to Damascus.\n\nFor much of the 18th and 19th centuries Quneitra was abandoned. In 1868 a travel handbook reported that the site was a \"ruined village of about 80 or 100 houses\" and that a large \"caravanserai\" also stood in ruins. Semi-nomadic pastoral groups such as the Arab Al Fadl and Banu Nu'aym tribes and several Turkmen tribes grazed their flocks in Quneitra's rocky lands.\n\nIn 1873, a group of Circassians from Sivas in Anatolia settled in Quneitra. This initial group did not cultivate the area for a number of years. A second wave of Circassians, numbering about 2,000, arrived in the Golan in 1878 via Acre after fleeing Bulgaria due to the Russo-Turkish War. Along with Quneitra, they settled or built number of other villages in the vicinity. The Circassians began farming the area and each family was given title to 70 to 130 dunams of land by the government depending on the family's size. The Ottomans encouraged Circassian settlement in the Golan as a means to drive a wedge between the frequently rebellious Druze villages of Mount Hermon and those in Jabal Hauran. The Circassians of Quneitra engaged in sustained conflicts with the Druze and the Al Fadl through the remainder of the 19th century.\n\nModern Quneitra grew around the nucleus of the old Ottoman caravanserai, which had been built using the stones of a ruined ancient settlement. By the mid-1880s, Quneitra had become the main city and seat of government of the Golan. Gottlieb Schumacher wrote in 1888 that it \"consists of 260 buildings, which are mostly well and carefully constructed of basalt stones, and contains, excluding the soldiers and officials, 1,300 inhabitants, principally Circassians.\" Circassians moved away from the Golan began after the Six-Day War and again after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring World War I, the Australian Mounted Division and 5th Cavalry Division defeated the Ottoman Turks at Quneitra on 29 September 1918, before they took Damascus (see also Battle of Megiddo (1918)).\n\nQuneitra saw several battles during the Syria-Lebanon Campaign of the Second World War, including the Battle of Damascus and Battle of Kissoué.\n\nWhen the modern states of Syria and Israel gained their independence from France and Britain respectively after the Second World War, Quneitra gained a new strategic significance as a key road junction some from the border. It became a prosperous market town and military garrison, with its population tripling to over 20,000 people, predominately Arabs.\n\nQuneitra was the Syrian headquarters for the Golan Heights. The Israeli capture of the city occurred in chaotic circumstances on 10 June 1967, the last day of the Six-Day War. Israeli forces advancing towards Quneitra from the north-west prompted Syrian troops to deploy north of the city, under heavy bombardment, to defend the road to Damascus. At , Syrian radio broadcast an announcement that the city had fallen, though it actually had not. Alarmed, the Syrian Army's redeployment turned into a chaotic retreat along the Damascus road.\n\nAccording to 8th Brigade Commander Ibrahim Isma'il Khahya:\nWe received orders to block the roads leading to Quneitra. But then the fall of the city was announced and that caused many of my soldiers to leave the front and run back to Syria while the roads were still open. They piled onto vehicles. It further crushed our morale. I retreated before I ever saw an enemy soldier. \nAlthough a correction was broadcast two hours later, the Israelis took advantage of the confusion to seize Quneitra. An armoured brigade under Colonel Albert Mandler entered Quneitra at and found the city deserted and strewn with abandoned military equipment. One of the Israeli commanders later commented:\n\nWe arrived almost without hindrance to the gates of Quneitra ... All around us there were huge quantities of booty. Everything was in working order. Tanks with their engines still running, communication equipment still in operation had been abandoned. We captured Quneitra without a fight.\n\n\"Time\" magazine reported: \"In an effort to pressure the United Nations into enforcing a ceasefire, Damascus Radio undercut its own army by broadcasting the fall of the city of El Quneitra three hours before it actually capitulated. That premature report of the surrender of their headquarters destroyed the morale of the Syrian troops left in the Golan area.\"\n\nA ceasefire was agreed later in the afternoon, leaving Quneitra under Israeli control. In June 1967, \"Time\" magazine wrote that: \"The city of El Quneitra was a ghost town, its shops shuttered, its deserted streets patrolled by Israelis on house-to-house searches for caches of arms and ammunition. The hills echoed with explosions as Israeli sappers systematically destroyed the miniature Maginot line from which the Syrians had shelled kibbutzim across the Sea of Galilee.\"\n\nThe United Nations Special Representative, Nils-Göran Gussing, visited it in July and reported that \"nearly every shop and every house seemed to have been broken into and looted\" and that some buildings had been set on fire after they had been stripped. Although Israeli spokesmen told Gussing that Quneitra had actually been looted by the withdrawing Syrians, the UN representative viewed this as unlikely given the extremely short space of time between the erroneous radio announcement and the fall of the city a few hours later. He concluded that \"responsibility for this extensive looting of the town of Quneitra lay to a great extent with the Israeli forces.\"\n\nCircassians dispersion from the Golan began after the Six-Day War, then additional numbers moved to the Caucasus after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe deserted city remained in Israeli hands for the next six years. However, Israel and Syria remained in a state of war throughout this period (and, indeed, to the present day). The town gained a fresh symbolic value; it was seen by the Syrians as \"the badge of Syria's defeat, an emblem of hatred between Syria and Israel and a cross [Syrian President Hafez al-Assad] had to bear.\" Syria shelled the city several times during the early 1970s; in June 1970 a Syrian armored unit launched an attack, and in November 1972, Damascus radio announced that Syrian artillery had again shelled Quneitra.\n\nDuring the first few days of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Quneitra was briefly recaptured by the Syrian Army before it was repulsed in an Israeli counter-offensive. \nIn the middle of October 1973 the Israeli counter-offensive started. The Syrians had massed nearly 1,000 tanks along a front. With a massive concentration of tanks, the Israelis lashed into the Syrian forces. The Syrians at first fell back, but then managed to counterattack and drive back into occupied territory. Quneitra changed hands several times. Finally, Israeli armored units, closely supported by Phantoms and Skyhawks performing close air support with napalm strikes against the forward Syrian units, halted the Syrian drive and turned the Syrian Army back.\n\nIsrael continued to control the city until early June 1974, when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States-brokered disengagement agreement signed on 31 May 1974. The surrender of Quneitra was controversial, with Israeli settlers and the Likud and National Religious Party opposing it. According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided that the city was to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the Israelis to pull back further.\n\nIn an attempt to block the withdrawal, a group of settlers from Merom Golan – a settlement established in 1967 – took over an abandoned bunker in Quneitra and declared it to be a new settlement called Keshet (Quneitra in Hebrew). The settlers also set about razing the existing town to the ground. The leader of Merom Golan, Yehuda Harel, and another Merom Golan member, Shimshon Wollner, initiated the destruction of Quneitra, which was carried out by the Land Development Administration of the Jewish National Fund. Harel later described what happened:\n\nWollner and Harel asked the Jewish National Fund to carry out the work, ostensibly to prepare an area for agricultural cultivation, but were refused as they did not have permission from the Israeli army. They then approached the Assistant to the Head of Northern Command and asked him to mark on a map which buildings the army needed. According to Harel,\n\nThe buildings were systematically stripped, with anything movable being removed and sold to Israeli contractors, before they were pulled apart with tractors and bulldozers.\n\nThe disengagement went into force on 6 June. On 26 June, the Syrian president Hafez al-Assad travelled to Quneitra where he pledged to return the rest of the occupied territories to Syrian control. Western reporters accompanied Syrian refugees returning to the city in early July 1974 and described what they saw on the ground. \"Time\" magazine's correspondent reported that \"Most of its buildings are knocked flat, as though by dynamite, or pockmarked by shellfire.\" \"Le Monde\"'s Syria correspondent, in a report for \"The Times\", gave a detailed eyewitness description of the destruction:\n\nToday the city is unrecognisable. The houses with their roofs lying on the ground look like gravestones. Parts of the rubble are covered with fresh earth furrowed by bulldozer tracks. Everywhere there are fragments of furniture, discarded kitchen utensils, Hebrew newspapers dating from the first week of June; here a ripped-up mattress, there the springs of an old sofa. On the few sections of wall still standing, Hebrew inscriptions proclaim: \"There'll be another round\"; \"You want Quneitra, you'll have it destroyed.\"\n\nIsrael asserted that most of the damage had been caused in the two wars and during the artillery duels in between. Several reports from before the withdrawal did refer to the city as \"ruined\" and \"shell-scarred\". \"The Times\"' correspondent saw the city for himself on 6 May, a month before the Israeli withdrawal, and described it as being \"in ruins and deserted after seven years of war and dereliction. It looks like a wild west city struck by an earthquake and if the Syrians get it back they will face a major feat of reconstruction. Nearly every building is heavily damaged and scores have collapsed.\"\n\nDirect evidence of the city's condition was provided when it was filmed on 12 May 1974 by a British television news team which included the veteran journalist Peter Snow, who was reporting for Independent Television News on the disengagement negotiations. His report was broadcast on ITN's \"News at Ten\" programme. According to \"The Times\"' correspondent Edward Mortimer, \"viewers were thus afforded a panoramic view of the city, which had stood almost completely empty since the Syrian army evacuated it in 1967. It could be seen that many of the buildings were damaged, but most of them were still standing.\" After it was handed over, \"very few buildings were left standing. Most of those destroyed did not present the jagged outline and random heaps of rubble usually produced by artillery or aerial bombardment. The roofs lay flat on the ground, 'pancaked' in a manner which I am told can only be achieved by systematic dynamiting of the support walls inside.\" Mortimer concluded that the footage \"establishes beyond reasonable doubt that much of the destruction took place after 12 May—at a time when there was no fighting anywhere near Kuneitra.\"\n\nThe United Nations established a \"Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories\", which engaged a Swiss engineer Edward Gruner to investigate the damage. Gruner and a team of surveyors spent four months in Quneitra, documenting every building and its condition. His report concluded that Israeli forces had deliberately destroyed the city prior to their withdrawal, including almost 4,000 buildings and a large amount of infrastructure, of value estimated at 463 million Syrian pounds. The report's conclusions were subsequently adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. It passed a resolution on 29 November 1974 describing the destruction of Quneitra as \"a grave breach of the [Fourth] Geneva Convention\" and \"condemn[ing] Israel for such acts,\" by a margin of 93 votes to 8, with 74 abstentions. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights also voted to condemn the \"deliberate destruction and devastation\" of Quneitra in a resolution of 22 February 1975, by a margin of 22 votes to one (the United States) with nine abstentions.\n\nThe city remains in a destroyed condition. Syria has left the ruins in place and built a museum to memorialize its destruction. It maintains billboards at the ruins of many buildings and effectively preserves it in the condition that the Israeli army left it in. The former residents of the town have not returned and Syria discourages the re-population of the area. However, in the 2004 census by the Central Bureau of Statistics, a small population of 153 people living in 28 households was recorded, all living in the neighborhood of Rasm al-Rawabi. The \"Rough Guide to Syria\" describes the appearance of the city in 2001: \"The first sight of the flattened houses on Quneitra's outskirts is the most dramatic; many of the unscathed roofs simply lie on top of a mass of rubble, leaving the impression of a building that has imploded.\"\n\nThe city has often been used as a stop for foreign VIPs, ranging from the Soviet foreign minister Alexei Kosygin in June 1976 to Pope John Paul II in May 2001. Only a handful of families now live in the town, making a living by providing services for the United Nations troops patrolling the demilitarized zone. According to \"The Times\", \"the carefully preserved ruined city has become a pilgrimage site for a generation of Syrians.\"\n\nThe city can be visited by tourists, but a permit from the Syrian Ministry of the Interior is required, and sight-seeing is supervised by a military guide. The principal sights on the standard tour are the remains of Quneitra's hospital, mosque and Greek Orthodox church. A \"Liberated Quneitra Museum\", displaying artifacts from the city's ancient and medieval past, is housed in the former Ottoman Turkish caravanserai in the city centre. The western edge of the city marks the start of \"no-man's land\" beyond which lies Israeli-controlled territory. It is not possible to visit Quneitra directly from Israel.\n\nOn 13 November 2012, during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, which had begun in March 2011, Syria′s president Bashar al-Assad issued a decreed establishment of a branch of the University of Damascus in Quneitra. \n\nOn 6 June 2013, the nearby Quneitra border crossing was attacked by rebel forces and temporarily occupied, with Syrian army later retaking the crossing; In July 2013, opposition forces attacked a military checkpoint in Quneitra, and by the next day were attacking several Syrian Arab Army positions in Quneitra. \n\nIn August 2014, rebel forces captured the crossing. A Filipino peacekeeper of the UNDOF was wounded during the fighting. As a result the Austrian government announced the withdrawal of its troops from the UN mission.\n\nOn 26 July 2018, the Syrian Army took back the town of Quneitra after rebels surrendered and handed over the heavy and medium weapons to army.\n\n\n\n"}

The series is run by RallyCar, which also runs the Rally America stage rallying series.\n\nRallyCar Rallycross is different from SCCA RallyCross, which is similar to Autocross but contested on an unpaved surface. Cars run one at-a-time, unlike rallycross, where competitors race wheel-to-wheel. The first event attracted names such as Travis Pastrana, Dave Mirra and Tanner Foust.\n\nRallycross made its US debut at X Games 16 in 2010, under the name SuperRally, organised by RallyCar. The championship is aimed to make rallycross grow at a national level in the United States.\n\nThree events were held at the end of 2010 at New Jersey Motorsports Park. The first full season will be run in 2011, with three races being also valid for the Global Rallycross Championship in the West Coast and three in the Midwest as a supporting event to the Traxxas TORC Series.\n"}

The fortress was built in 1142 by Pagan the Butler, Lord of Montreal. While Raynald ruled, several truces existed between the Christian and Muslim states in the Holy Land, none of which he made any qualms about breaking. The last straw came in 1183 when he organized an expedition around the Red Sea. He captured the town of Aqaba, giving him a base of operations against Islam's holiest city, Mecca. Saladin, the leader of the Muslim forces, could not tolerate this and moved against Raynald's stronghold.\n\nThe Muslims had sought to take Kerak for several years, but now they stretched its defenses to the breaking point. At one point, nine catapults were bombarding the walls and inhabitants within.\n\nInside the walls, a royal marriage was taking place. Humphrey IV of Toron, Raynald's stepson and heir, was to take the hand of Isabella of Jerusalem, the King's half sister. As the wedding ceremonies continued, Saladin instructed his troops to avoid bombarding the young couple's quarters, but pressure on Kerak continued. Messengers managed to escape the town and take word to the King, Baldwin IV.\n\nBaldwin immediately marched with a relief force, accompanied by his regent, Raymond III of Tripoli. Although suffering from leprosy since childhood, Baldwin's determination to frustrate Saladin's attempt was such that he led personally, although he had to be carried on a stretcher. The Christian forces arrived while Saladin was still struggling against the heavy fortifications. Knowing he risked being crushed between the royal army and the walls of Kerak, he lifted the siege.\n\nSaladin returned to Kerak again in 1184, with the same result. Kerak remained a Crusader stronghold and a symbol of the West's grip in the region until falling to Muslim control in 1188. The next time the Crusaders had to contend with a major siege, it was at the walls of Jerusalem itself.\n\nThe motion picture \"Kingdom of Heaven\" contains a fictional portrayal of the siege. In the film, knights under the command of Balian engaged the Ayyubids as they approached Kerak, so that defenseless citizens could retreat to Raynald's castle. The film also showed the siege not taking place, but King Baldwin IV and Saladin negotiating a settlement. Baldwin then punished Raynald for breaking the truce (with Saladin) by attacking a Muslim caravan.\n\n"}

The Welsh National Gymanfa Ganu Association is responsible for overseeing the Cymanfaoedd Ganu held in North America. \nThe Gymanfa Ganu at Niagara Falls was the first National Gymanfa Ganu (Guh-mahn'-va Gahn'-ee) to be held in the United States. Although exact estimates are unknown, it is believed that 3,000 were in attendance. The Welsh Americans of Youngstown, Ohio are generally given the majority of credit for helping to perpetuate this movement. However, there were many others involved in the planning for the event. Delegations from Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and Michigan, traveling by train and auto to Niagara Falls, were joined there by equally enthusiastic Welsh from Ontario.\n\nAfter the success of the first Gymanfa Ganu, plans were already being made for another Gymanfa at Niagara Falls the following year. An organizational structure was put into place with Will Lewis (Youngstown, Ohio) as President; Ellis Hughes (Niagara Falls, New York) as Vice President; Dave Lewis (Youngstown, Ohio) as Secretary; and W. B. Jones (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) as Treasurer. This was the beginning of what has been known as the \"Welsh National Gymanfa Ganu Association\", renamed in 2011 to \"Welsh North American Association\" or WNAA.\n\nThis change was adopted at the September 3, 2011, Annual General Meeting of The Welsh National Gymanfa Ganu Association, in Cleveland, Ohio, in recognition of the broadened mission of the organization. This mission is stated as \"to preserve, develop and promote our Welsh cultural heritage including, but not limited to, the Gymanfa Ganu, literature, cultural traditions...\" (see Official Website link below) \n\nWith the exception of three years during World War II (1943-1945), a Gymanfa Ganu (commonly just referred to as a \"National\") has been held in North America every year since 1929. In 1969 the Gymanfa was held in Cardiff, and in 1974 in Swansea, both in Wales (there were two Nationals held in North America in each of those two years, but both are not included in the official count).\n"}

Schulz. This adaptation of the 1967 musical \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\" originally aired on the CBS network on November 6, 1985. The special was produced by Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates. It is the first \"Peanuts\" special to have input from the Japanese animation studio, Studio Pierrot, and like the other specials, had input from Toei Animation, also from Japan.\n\nThe program opens with the other \"Peanuts\" characters singing the title song to Charlie Brown.\n\nIn the next scene, Schroeder plays Beethoven's \"Moonlight Sonata\" and Lucy sings along. She tries to tell him that they should get married. Schroeder ignores her, then Lucy says, \"My aunt Marian was right; never try to discuss marriage with a musician.\"\n\nCharlie Brown hopes for the first time to be able to keep a kite but he once again fails. Sally writes a letter to Ann Flanders about the Valentine's Day card she gets.\n\nCharlie Brown gives Lucy a Valentine's Day card and mistakenly says, \"This is for you, Lucy. Merry Christmas!\" Charlie Brown sees Marcie and thinks that she is going to give him a Valentine's Day card but she does not. Lucy comes up to Schroeder again and talks about saucepans, and, again, Schroeder cannot stand it.\n\nSnoopy imagines that he is a wild animal. Charlie Brown, Schroeder, Linus, and Lucy work on their book reports on Peter Rabbit (\"Book Report\"). Lucy teaches Linus about nature in her own way while Charlie Brown tries to correct her, to no avail (\"Little Known Facts\").\n\nCharlie Brown writes a letter to his pencil pal about his downfall at his baseball game. Charlie Brown pleads his baseball team to win the game by chanting \"T-E-A-M\" but fails. Lucy dreams of becoming a queen but gives up dreaming. Charlie Brown tries to get the Little Red-Haired Girl to know him better but fails.\n\nSchroeder's Sing Along has songs for the play in \"The Concert\" by singing \"Home On the Range\" with his friends. And the five friends sing while Lucy, Linus, and Sally argue. Lucy wanting her pencil back from Linus, and threatening to tell Sally what he said about her if he didn't give back the pencil (Linus called Sally an Enigma). Snoopy sings a song devoted to \"Suppertime\" when he sees Charlie Brown serving him his supper.\n\nIn the end, Charlie Brown and all of his gang learn all about \"Happiness\" and why it's all around them; the special ends with Lucy telling Charlie Brown that he is a good man.\n\n\nNote: Peppermint Patty, Franklin, 5, and Frieda appeared in the special but had no lines.\n\nWarner Home Video released \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\" on DVD for the first time on January 26, 2010, as a part of their Charlie Brown \"Remastered Deluxe Edition\" line. The DVD, for once in the line, did not include a bonus special on the disc (likely because this animated feature is twice as long as the majority of them.) It did, however, include a featurette entitled \"Animating a Charlie Brown Musical\".\n"}
