{"id": "47235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47235", "title": "16 Psyche", "text": "16 Psyche\n\nPsyche ( ; minor planet designation: 16 Psyche) is one of the ten most massive asteroids in the asteroid belt. It is over 200 km (120 mi) in diameter and contains a little less than 1% of the mass of the entire asteroid belt. It is thought to be the exposed iron core of a protoplanet. It is the most massive metallic M-type asteroid. Psyche was discovered by the Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis on 17 March 1852 from Naples and named after the Greek mythological figure Psyche.\n\nThe first fifteen asteroids to be discovered were given symbols by astronomers as a type of shorthand notation. Psyche was given an iconic symbol, as were several other asteroids discovered over the next few years. The symbol , a semicircle topped by a star, represents a butterfly's wing, symbol of the soul (\"psyche\" is the Greek word for 'soul'), and a star. In 1851, German astronomer J. F. Encke suggested using a circled number, and 16 Psyche was the first new asteroid to be discovered that was designated using this scheme when American astronomer James Ferguson published his observations in 1852.\n\nPsyche is massive enough that its gravitational perturbations on other asteroids can be observed, which enables a mass measurement. As of 2017 the best mass estimate is  kg.\n\nThe first size estimate of Psyche came from IRAS thermal infrared emission observations. They showed that it had a diameter of about 253 km, although it was likely an overestimate as Psyche was viewed pole-on at that time.\n\nLight curve analysis indicates Psyche appears somewhat irregular in shape. There is a pronounced mass deficit near the equator at about 90° longitude comparable to Rheasilvia basin on Vesta. There are also two additional smaller (50–70 km in diameter) crater-like depressions near the south pole. that Psyche's north pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (−7°, 34°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of 95°.\n\nObservations of two multi-chord stellar occultations of 2010 and 2014 allow the matching of light curve inversions model DAMIT 1806 that give an equivalent Volume mean diameter of 216+/-12 km, and an equivalent Surface mean diameter of 227 +/- 13 km.\n\nThe density of Psyche that follows from size and mass estimates mentioned above –  kg/m³ – is consistent of that of metallic object with a porosity of about 40%. This is higher than most previous estimates.\n\nRadar observations indicate that Psyche has a fairly pure iron–nickel composition,\nconsistent with it having one of the highest radar albedos in the asteroid belt (). Psyche seems to have a surface that is 90% metallic (iron), with small amounts – % – of orthopyroxene.\n\nThe NASA Infrared Telescope Facility at the Mauna Kea Observatories released evidence (~3 μm absorption feature) of the presence of water or hydroxyl ions on the asteroid in October 2016. The water is believed to have reached Psyche via past impacts from smaller asteroids containing volatile substances such as carbon, hydrogen and water.\n\nBased on its composition Psyche appears to be an exposed metallic core or a fragment of a metallic core from a larger differentiated parent body some 500 kilometers in diameter. If Psyche is indeed one, there could be other asteroids on similar orbits. However, Psyche is not part of any identified asteroid family. One hypothesis is that the collision that formed Psyche occurred very early in the Solar System's history, and all the other remnants have since been ground into fragments by subsequent collisions or had their orbits perturbed beyond recognition. However, this scenario is considered to have a probability of just 1%. An alternative is that Psyche was broken by impacts, but not catastrophically torn apart. In this case, it may be a candidate for the parent body of the mesosiderites, a class of stony–iron meteorites.\n\nAnother possibility is that Psyche may be an endmember of diverse relic bodies left by the inner planet formation. The asteroid's mantle may have been stripped away not by a single collision but by multiple (>3) relatively slow hit-and-run collisions with bodies of comparable or larger size. What is left is a metallic core covered by thin layer of silicates, which reveal itself spectrally. In such a case Psyche would be analogous to Mercury but much less massive.\n\nNo spacecraft has visited Psyche, but in 2014 a mission to Psyche was proposed to NASA. A team led by Lindy Elkins-Tanton, the director of the School for Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, presented a concept for a robotic \"Psyche\" orbiter. This team argued that 16 Psyche would be a valuable object for study because it is the only metallic core-like body discovered so far.\n\nThe spacecraft would orbit Psyche for 20 months, studying its topography, surface features, gravity, magnetism, and other characteristics and would be based on current technology, avoiding high cost and the necessity to develop new technologies. On September 30, 2015, the \"Psyche\" orbiter mission was one of five Discovery Program semifinalist proposals.\n\nThe mission was approved by NASA on January 4, 2017 and was originally targeted to launch in October 2023, arriving at the asteroid in 2030, following an Earth gravity assist spacecraft maneuver in 2024 and a Mars flyby in 2025. In May 2017 the launch date was moved up to target a more efficient trajectory, launching in 2022 and arriving in 2026 with a Mars gravity assist in 2023.\n\n"}

Buddy Baker earned the pole position with a speed of while the average speed of the race was . More than 23,000 race fans would see Donnie Allison lose the race by more than two laps. Don Biederman was the only foreign-born driver (he was born in Port Credit, Ontario) and raced under the employ of Bill Champion for this race in a 1968 Ford Torino. Roy Tyner would finish in last place after picking up an engine problem on lap 2 with his 1969 Pontiac vehicle.\n\nOther notable drivers to develop problems in the race were: Elmo Langley, Cale Yarborough, Ed Negre, and Bill Seifert. Wendell Scott (the first African American driver in NASCAR history to win a race), Buddy Baker (who was the highest finishing driver to DNF from the race in 8th place), and Benny Parsons were three other notable drivers of this decade who participated in the race. Yarborough would acquire a serious injury after clobbering his vehicle into one of the walls.\n\nNASCAR on ABC would begin televising a select number of races during the 1970 NASCAR Grand National Series season. The televised broadcasting of NASCAR races eventually brought this once-regional motorsport into the national spotlight and eventually gained a major sponsor through Big Tobacco manufacturer R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for the 1971 season. This alliance between tobacco and stock car racing would last until the 2004 NASCAR Cup Series season. The transition to purpose-built racecars began in the early 1960s and occurred gradually over that decade. Changes made to the sport by the late 1960s brought an end to the \"strictly stock\" vehicles of the 1950s; most of the cars were trailered to events or hauled in by trucks.\n\nBiederman would make his grand exit from the NASCAR Cup Series after this race while Joe Hines would make his introduction into top-level stock car racing here. David Pearson would eventually merge as the eventual champion for the year. Pearson would later be recognized for winning his races more consistently than Richard Petty (who finished 21st in this race and would stop racing in Ford vehicles after this race) but would have an abbreviated racing career compared to him.\n\nNotable crew chiefs for this race were Herb Nab, Harry Hyde, Dale Inman, Banjo Matthews, Glen Wood, Dick Hutcherson, and Cotton Owens.\n\n\n\"† signifies that the driver is known to be deceased\" <br>\n\"* Driver failed to finish race\"\n"}

Nine were from the Zuwayya and eight were from the Tobu. Initially, only small-arms fire was used in the clashes, but on the second day the situation escalated, with RPGs and anti-aircraft guns being used. According to the Zuwayya, the fighting started when a young man from their tribe was killed three days before by three Tobu members. A head of the local National Transitional Council (NTC) militia reported that the Zuwayya man was a smuggler and was killed after he opened fire on a Tobu militia, which was charged with combating illegal trafficking, killing five of the militiamen. The Tobu, on their part, stated that they were being attacked by the Zuwayya, who were supported by the NTC, with the intention of exterminating them. The Tobu claimed discrimination by the Zuwayya, due to them being dark-skinned, on an even higher level than during the Gaddafi-era. Farhat Abdel Karim Bu Hareg, the coordinator of social affairs in the local Kufra government said that they will have to declare independence of the region if the NTC does not act against attacks by mercenaries, referring to Tobu fighters.\n\nThe region already experienced unrest during the rule of Muammar Gaddafi. In 2009, an uprising was suppressed by the Libyan army using helicopter gunships.\n\nOn 14 February, clashes continued around Kufra, with the NTC sending reinforcement to help the Zuwayya tribe. Tobu spokesmen said that they were besieged and were being heavily shelled by the Zuwayya, and added that it was an attempt to exterminate the Tobu tribe with government participation. An NTC spokesman stated that it was a low-level fight between revolutionaries and weapons smugglers backed by foreign elements. A Tobu member claimed five of his comrades were killed in the new round of fighting, while another stated that there were no deaths, only injuries. The fighting continued, and on 15 and 16 February, another 15 Zuwayya were killed and 45 wounded. The Tobu reported that since the start of the clashes 55 of their members had been killed and 117 wounded, with the wounded not being able to be evacuated via the airport due to it being controlled by the Zuwayya.\n\nOn 18 February, more clashes in Kufra left another two people dead. At this point, it was reported that the military sent reinforcements to the region, in an attempt to stop the tribal fighting.\n\nOn 21 February, a Red crescent worker reported that 50 civilians were killed in the past 24 hours in Kufra due to mortar and rockets being fired on residential area. A spokesman of the Zuwayya tribe said that three people were killed and 25 injured.\n\nThe leader of the Tobu tribe Issa Abdelmajid, stated that 113 Tobu were killed (including six children) and 241 wounded in 10 days of fighting. For their part, the Zuwayya said 23 of their tribesmen were killed and 53 wounded.\n\nOn 22 February, four people were killed and 10 injured in renewed fighting. NTC leader Abdul Jalil said that Gaddafi loyalists were seeding sedition in Kufra but did not elaborate.\n\nOn 23 February, the Libyan National Army was dispatched to Kufra to enforce the peace. Army commandos had reportedly taken control of the airport, city and whole region, according to Zuwayya tribal sources inside the city and both tribes used the renewed peace for evacuation of wounded to Tripoli.\n\nOn 24 February, fighting resumed in Kufra, injuring several people, according to both tribes, with each blaming the other for the renewed fighting. A security official from the Zuwayya tribe stated that the army had not done anything to prevent the clashes. Later during the day, an ICRC medic confirmed that fighting de-escalated but the situation remained tense. The ICRC also evacuated 28 wounded patients from both tribes to Tripoli hospital.\n\nOn 25 February, a United Nations team started providing relief supplies. Georg Charpentier, an UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Libya and chief of UNSMIL mission, confirmed that a ceasefire between the tribes was holding with the Libyan army contingent in place to prevent further clashes. NTC chairman Jalil urged both tribes to make peace.\n\nOn 20 April, fighting erupted after Zuwayya tribesmen reportedly killed a Tobu man. Three people were killed and 17 wounded in subsequent fighting, all of them Tobu. Three government soldiers were also wounded. By the evening on 21 April, 12 people had been killed and 35 wounded on the Tobu side.\n\nOn 10 June, fighting flared up again in Kufra. Tobu tribesmen were engaged in clashes with former rebels who had become members of the new Libyan National Army. A Kufra official said the Tobu had launched an attack on the city with tanks and other heavy weapons. A Tobu representative said it was the tribe that had come under attack. He said the fighting had erupted after the former militiamen, known as the Libya Shield Battalion, had shelled the tribe's district. But a local security official said an attack on a security checkpoint in the town triggered the violence. The fighting continued into the next day and at least 23 people were killed. Among the dead were 20 Tobu tribesmen, including at least 15 tribal fighters, and three government soldiers.\n\nSix more people, including two soldiers, were killed in renewed fighting in Kufra on 26 June. The fighting died down later in the evening. However, the fighting continued late on 27 June and for the next three days another 47 people were killed and 100 wounded. 32 of the dead were from the Tobu tribe, 14 were from the Zwai tribe and one was a government soldier.\n\nAccording to UNSMIL mission more than 100 people were killed in the fighting, half of Kufra population had fled the fighting and more than 200 foreign migrants were waiting as of 29 February for evacuation. Associated Press journalist on the ground also witnessed at least 160 houses demolished by rocket attacks in one neighbourhood alone with the shelling also hitting a school where civilians were seeking shelter.\n"}

Main St. in Alexis, Illinois. The building, which operated from 1889 until 1920, hosted traveling entertainment and community functions. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 30, 1987.\n\nThe opera house was constructed in 1889 by William S. Weir, a Monmouth businessman who also owned the Bank of Alexis. It hosted its first show on November 1 of the same year, when the May Bretonne Company performed there. The opera house hosted traveling theatrical acts, musicians, and lecturers and advertised itself as hosting an act every three weeks. In addition, a number of civic functions were held in the building; Alexis High School held its graduation ceremony in the opera house every year until the building's closure, and numerous public meetings and community performances took place there as well. In the 1910s, religious services were also held in the building.\n\nIn 1920, the state's fire marshal shut down the opera house over safety code violations, as the building had no fire escape and its seats were not attached to the floor. The building's owner, William A. McKnight, considered the changes too expensive to be worth undertaking and never reopened the opera house. McKnight continued to run a funeral parlor and hardware store in the building's commercial spaces through 1950.\n\nThe Alexis Opera House was designed in the Romanesque Revival style. The two-story building's plan features three storefronts on its first floor and the theater on its second. The front facade is divided into bays delineating the three storefronts; the storefronts feature recessed glass entrances supported by columns, while the second floor is constructed of brick. Brick piers which extend through the roofline separate the second-story bays. Each bay features three vertical sets of windows, with one wide set in the middle of each bay and narrower sets on its sides. Limestone coursing marks the top and bottom of the second-story windows and separates the clerestory windows from the rest. The parapet roof features ornamental brickwork.\n"}

{"id": "3530599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3530599", "title": "Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)", "text": "Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)\n\nBaa Baa Black Sheep (later syndicated as Black Sheep Squadron) is a period military television series that aired on NBC from 1976 until 1978. Its premise was based on the experiences of United States Marine Corps aviator Greg Boyington and his World War II \"Black Sheep Squadron\". The series was created and produced by Stephen J. Cannell. The opening credits read: \"In World War II, Marine Corps Major Greg 'Pappy' Boyington commanded a squadron of fighter pilots. They were a collection of misfits and screwballs who became the terrors of the South Pacific. They were known as the Black Sheep.\"\n\nMajor Greg \"Pappy\" Boyington is the commanding officer of VMF-214, a group of \"misfit\" fighter pilots based in the Solomon Islands during World War II. Pappy often intercedes in altercations at the base, but everyone seems to pull together when they are assigned missions in the air. Pappy likes to drink and fight a lot when not flying missions. He owns a Bull Terrier named \"Meatball\" — which he claims belongs to General Moore to get the dog on the base against regulations in \"Flying Misfits\", but General Moore says he \"wouldn't own an ugly mutt like that.\"\n\nThe series premise was very loosely based on a portion of the real-life military career of Gregory Boyington, known as \"Pappy\" due to his \"advanced\" age compared to the younger pilots under his command. (He was 30 when he took command of VMF-214, but in the series pilot, he is stated to be 35.) Boyington, who was a technical adviser for the series, commented that the show was \"fiction based on reality\" and that no regular character in the series except for himself actually existed. Although in his book of the same name, there is a General \"Nuts\" Moore who has similar characteristics to General Moore in the series. Also in the book is Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Smoak, on whom Colonel Lard is based. Lard has almost the same animosity for Major Boyington in the TV series as Smoak does in the book. In the documentary film \"Pappy Boyington Field\", Robert Conrad shares personal insight about Pappy from their time together during the television series.\n\nPappy has the most air victories, or \"kills\", of any pilot in the squadron. In the pilot episode, Boyington has six kills from his tour with the Flying Tigers. His count climbs into the mid-20s as the series progresses. The real-life Boyington had 14 kills in 32 days during his first tour of duty with VMF-214, and finished with 25 confirmed victories.\n\nThe TV show's squadron is based on the fictional island of Vella la Cava. There is an actual island called Vella Lavella in the New Georgia Group of the Soloman Islands, but in the initial episode \"Flying Misfits,\" Vella la Cava was represented on an aviation sectional chart by the real Kolombangara Island. The actual VMF-214 flew out of Henderson Field on the island of Guadalcanal during the Solomon Islands campaign.\n\nPopular character John \"Hutch\" Hutchinson (Joey Aresco) was killed off in the episode \"Last One for Hutch\" and replaced as chief mechanic by master sergeant Andy Micklin (Red West), who had joined the squadron a few episodes earlier in \"Devil in the Slot\".\n\n\n\n\nThe day of the show's debut, \"The Washington Post\" called \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" a \"war-is-swell series [aimed] at anyone who remembers World War II as a rousing, blowzy, fraternity turkey-shoot.\"\n\nAlthough the title \"Baa Baa Black Sheep\" comes from a nursery rhyme, the song heard at the beginning of the opening credits is actually the chorus to \"The Whiffenpoof Song\", written in 1909 as a homage to Rudyard Kipling's poem \"Gentlemen-Rankers\". One of the squadron's real-life members, Paul \"Moon\" Mullen, adapted \"The Whiffenpoof Song\" for the squadron's use.\n\nThe name of the island where the real-life Black Sheep were stationed was Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands of the southern Pacific, known as \"The Slot\"; this was changed to Vella la Cava in the series for legal reasons. The same was done for the Rear Area Allied Command island of \"Espiritu Santo\" (Espritos Marcos). The Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California provided an adequate substitute backdrop for flying scenes. Filming of airfield scenes was primarily done at the now-closed Indian Dunes Airport in Valencia, California.\n\nSome air-battle scenes were actually short clips from the 1969 film \"Battle of Britain\", and German markings on the planes can clearly be seen. Other flying scenes pioneered the technique of mounting cameras on helmets worn by pilots, thus providing a pilot's-eye view never before seen in films featuring single-seat aircraft. Because of reflections from the Plexiglas canopies, many close-ups were shot with the canopies removed.\n\nThe Vought F4U and FG-1 Corsair fighter planes were leased to Universal Studios by private owners. Many scenes showing repairs on the aircraft were filmed during actual preventative maintenance. \"Japanese\" aircraft used in the series were actually North American T-6 Texan World War 2 trainer planes, which had been modified to resemble Japanese planes for the film \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" and later purchased by collectors. The Grumman J2F Duck float biplane belonged to legendary stunt pilot Frank Tallman and his Tallmanz Aviation museum in Santa Ana, California. Tallman often stated that this was his all-time favorite plane to fly, with the Corsair in a near-tie. Tallman provided or arranged for most of the aircraft used in the series.\n\nAt an aviation history symposium in 2002, members of the real VMF-214 were asked about the authenticity of the TV series. Retired Colonel Henry A. McCartney said the list of errors was too long to repeat. Boyington himself referred to the series as \"... inaccuracies, hogwash, and Hollywood hokum,\" although he did serve as technical advisor on the show, and had cameo appearances in two episodes. A 2001 History Channel documentary depicted some of these differences in greater detail.\n\nUniversal Studios Home Entertainment has released the complete first season on DVD in Region 1 in 2 volume sets. They also released volume 1 on DVD in the UK.\n\nIn Germany, ZYX Music GmbH released the entire series on DVD.\n\nOn December 7, 2015, it was announced that Shout! Factory had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1 and would release the final season on DVD on May 17, 2016.\n\nOn June 13, 2017, Universal Studios Home Entertainment re-released season 1 in a full season set.\n\n"}
{"id": "177675", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177675", "title": "Barnstorming", "text": "Barnstorming\n\nBarnstorming was a form of entertainment in which stunt pilots performed tricks, either individually or in groups called flying circuses. Devised to \"impress people with the skill of pilots and the sturdiness of planes\", it became popular in the United States during the Roaring Twenties. Barnstormers were pilots who flew throughout the country selling airplane rides and performing stunts; Charles Lindbergh first began flying in this capacity.\n\nThe Wright brothers and Glenn Curtiss had early flying exhibition teams, with solo flyers like Lincoln Beachey and Didier Masson also popular before World War I, but barnstorming did not become a formal phenomenon until the 1920s.\n\nDuring World War I, the United States manufactured a significant number of Curtiss JN-4 \"Jenny\" biplanes to train its military aviators and almost every U.S. airman learned to fly using the plane. After the war the U.S. federal government sold off the surplus material, including the Jennys, for a fraction of its initial value (they had cost the government $5,000 but were being sold for as low as $200). This allowed many servicemen who already knew how to fly the JN-4s, to purchase their own planes. The similar-looking Standard J-1 biplane was also available.\n\nAt the same time, numerous aircraft manufacturing companies sprang up, most going broke after building only a handful of planes. Many of these were reliable and even advanced designs which suffered from the failure of the aviation market to expand as expected, and a number of these found their way into the only active markets—mail carrying, barnstorming, and smuggling. Sometimes a plane and its owner would drift between the three activities as opportunity presented.\n\nCombined with the lack of Federal Aviation Regulations at the time, these factors allowed barnstorming to flourish.\n\nBarnstorming was performed not only by former military men, but also by women, minorities, and women minorities (e.g., Bessie Coleman). For example, on July 18, 1915, Katherine Stinson became the first woman in the world to perform a loop. Bessie Coleman, an African-American woman, \"not only thrilled audiences with her skills as a barnstormer, but she also became a role model for women and African Americans. Her very presence in the air threatened prevailing contemporary stereotypes. She also fought segregation when she could by using her influence as a celebrity\".\n\n\"More than any single event, Lindbergh's historic 1927 flight made Americans aware of the potential of commercial aviation, and there followed a boom in aviation activity during 1928 and 1929\". In fact, Charles Lindbergh engaged in barnstorming in his early years; Errold Bahl hired him as an assistant, and as a promotional stunt, Lindbergh \"volunteered to climb out onto the wing and wave to the crowds below\", which came to be known as \"wing-walking\".\n\nThe sensational journalism and economic prosperity that marked the Jazz Age in the United States allowed barnstormers to publicize aviation and eventually contributed to bringing about regulation and control. In 1925, the U.S. government began regulating aviation, when it passed the Contract Air Mail Act, which allowed the U.S. Post Office to hire private airlines to deliver mail, with payments based on the weight of the mail. The following year, President Calvin Coolidge signed the Air Commerce Act, which shifted the management of air routes to a new branch in the Department of Commerce, which was also responsible for \"licensing of planes and pilots, establishing safety regulations, and general promotion\".\n\nBarnstorming \"seemed to be founded on bravado, with 'one-upmanship' a major incentive\". By 1927, competition among barnstormers resulted in their performing increasingly dangerous tricks, and a rash of highly publicized accidents led to new safety regulations, which led to the demise of barnstorming. Spurred by a perceived need to protect the public and in response to political pressure by local pilots upset at barnstormers stealing their customers, the federal government enacted laws to regulate a fledgling civil aviation sector.\nThe laws included safety standards and specifications that were virtually impossible for barnstormers to meet, and restrictions on how low in altitude certain tricks could be performed (making it harder for spectators to see what was happening). The military also stopped selling Jennys in the late 1920s. This made it too difficult for barnstormers to make a living. Clyde Pangborn, who was pilot of the two-man aviation team who were the first to cross the Pacific Ocean nonstop in 1931, ended his barnstorming career in 1931. Some pilots, however, continued to wander the country giving rides as late as fall 1941.\n\n\"Barnstorming season\" ran from early spring until after the harvest and county fairs in the fall. Most barnstorming shows started with a pilot, or team of pilots flying over a small rural town to attract local attention. They would then land at a local farm (hence the \"barnstorming\") and negotiate for the use of a field as a temporary runway from which to stage an air show and offer airplane rides. After obtaining a base of operation, the pilot or group of aviators would \"buzz\" the village dropping flyers. In some towns the arrival of a barnstormer or an aerial troop would lead to a townwide shutdown as people attended the show.\n\nBarnstormers performed a variety of stunts, with some specializing as stunt pilots or aerialists. Stunt pilots performed a variety of aerobatic maneuvers, including spins, dives, loop-the-loops and barrel rolls, while aerialists performed feats of wing walking, stunt parachuting, midair plane transfers, or even playing tennis, target shooting, and dancing on the plane's wings.\nOther stunts include nose dives and flying through barns and this sometimes led to pilots crashing their planes.\n\nBarnstormers offered plane rides for a small fee; Charles Lindbergh, for example, charged five dollars for a 15-minute ride in his plane. However exciting and glamorous, it was not an easy way to make a steady living, and to make ends meet barnstormers, including Charles Lindbergh, had to moonlight as flying instructors, handymen, and sometimes even gas station attendants. Barnstormers often traded plane rides for room and board, both for commercial lodging and in private homes. \n\nAlthough barnstormers often worked in solitude or in very small teams, some also put together large \"flying circuses\" with several planes and stunt people. These acts employed promoters to book shows in towns ahead of time. They were the largest and most organized of all of the barnstorming acts. Some of the most famous were “The Five Blackbirds” (an African American flying group), “The Flying Aces Air Circus”, “The 13 Black Cats”, “Mabel Cody’s Flying Circus”, \"Inman Brothers Flying Circus\", and the “Gates Flying Circus”, to which Clyde Pangborn belonged until 1928.\n\nBarnstorming was the first major form of civil aviation in the history of aviation. It was also one of the most popular forms of entertainment during the Roaring Twenties.\n\nAt an individual level, barnstorming \"provided an exciting and challenging way to make a living, as well as an outlet for their creativity and showmanship\", for many pilots and stuntsmen.

The Festival also offers many live events, from pre-screening music, to new scores to accompany silent films, to full-fledged post-screening concerts and dance performances.\n\nThe Annual Festival is a non-competitive event, although since 2002 it has offered audience members the opportunity to cast ballots for favorite Documentary and Feature film and, in 2006, Favorite Short Subject. It screens International and American independent films and videos that highlight the Jewish experience; deal with themes of Jewish culture/heritage/history; and films of particular interest to the Jewish community. The Festival also presents narrative, documentary, animated and experimental works. Projects must be completed in 35mm, 16mm, Beta or 1/2 inch.

The causes may include predation levels rising per offspring (given the same level of overall predator pressure) and the allee effect, particularly the reduced likelihood of finding a mate.\n\nWhen the level of depensation is high enough that the population is no longer able to sustain itself, it is said to be a critical depensation. This occurs when the population size has a tendency to decline when the population drops below a certain level (known as the \"Critical depensation level\"). Ultimately this may lead to the population or fishery's collapse (resource depletion), or even local extinction.\n\nThe phenomenon of critical depensation may be modelled or defined by a negative second order derivative of population growth rate with respect of population biomass, which describes a situation where a decline in population biomass is not compensated by a corresponding increase in marginal growth per unit of biomass.\n\n"}

At its peak, the channel's videos featured Martin, his wife Heather Martin—also known by her online alias MommyOFive—and their children. In 2017, following claims that the parents were abusing their children in the \"prank\" videos, the channel became the center of a public controversy, as many saw their content as extreme in nature. \n\nCreated in 2015, the channel achieved success earning up to 176 million video views and around 750,000 subscribers at its peak. However, after the aforementioned controversy, all videos on the channel were removed, and the Martins stopped producing videos on the channel, aside from a formal public apology video. Mike Martin and Heather Martin took an Alford plea in September 2017 in regards to two counts per person of Maryland state child neglect charges and received supervised probation for five years.\n\nThe Martins ceased creating content on the DaddyOFive channel as a result of court ordered probation, but began producing similar content on a new channel called FamilyOFive, which was terminated by YouTube in July 2018 following renewed interest in the family. However, the Martins have their official website called , and a gaming channel on Twitch.\n\nThe channel was created on August 13, 2015; the channel's about page says, \"we as a FAMILY DECIDED to make this YouTube channel just for fun.\" The channel focused on Mike Martin, his wife Heather and their five children: Jake, Ryan, Emma, Cody, and Alex. The channel accumulated around 750,000 subscribers and 176 million views, prior to Martin removing the videos from public viewing. \"The Guardian\" and \"New York Magazine\" reported the videos were made private, while \"Time\" and \"The Washington Post\" reported that the videos were deleted.\n\nThe family became the centre of abuse claims following these prank videos which became gradually more extreme, with many videos involving Martin encouraging his eldest child, Jake, to physically and mentally abuse his younger siblings, often to the point of tears. One such video involved Cody, the youngest child, being thrown through a doorway by Jake and against a bookcase by Martin; he was left with what appeared to be injuries to his face. American actor, journalist and YouTube personality Philip DeFranco released a series of videos covering the channel and sharing his distaste for the content they created, starting with \"WOW... We Need To Talk About This...\" on April 17, 2017. He primarily focused on a video involving invisible ink being spilt, and two of the family's children, Cody and Alex, being falsely accused of making the mess. In the video, Cody cries and pleads hysterically after being screamed and sworn at and accused of lying, with Alex also facing a similar treatment from the parents. DeFranco's first video covering the channel was uploaded on April 17, and is credited by many news outlets for shining a light on the channel's extreme content. Andrew Griffin of \"The Independent\" wrote, \"[DeFranco's] video was viewed more than three million times and brought widespread condemnation of the DaddyOFive channel.\" The video has led to debates about sharenting and children being minor celebrities on social media. Two of the family's children, Cody and Emma, were removed from their custody and returned to their biological mother. The creators also issued a public apology for the videos and state they are \"a loving, close-knit family.\"\n\nThe DaddyOFive channel released a video on July 7 showing text expressing that it is not a dead channel and asking viewers to subscribe to Heather's MommyOFive channel for new videos and updates. In July 2017, DaddyOFive and MommyOFive channel had around 730,000 subscribers and 4.7 million video views, and around 110,000 subscribers and 2.1 million video views, respectively. Later, they changed their channel name to FamilyOFive after receiving the silver play button for MommyOFive.\n\nProsecutors from the Frederick County Circuit Court filed criminal charges against Michael and Heather Martin in August 2017, with each person facing two counts of \"neglect of a minor\". On September 11, 2017, the Martins pleaded guilty by way of an Alford plea and were sentenced to five years of supervised probation.\n\nThe FamilyOFive channel, a new outlet for the Martins' videos created while they were on probation, reinstituted the questionable pattern of behavior regarding abuse of the children featured in the videos. The channel was subsequently terminated on July 18, 2018, for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines, according to several news sources, and YouTube now requires videos featuring children to comply with local child labor laws.\n\nDespite their final termination, the Martins continue to post videos on their official website behind a monthly $5 subscription fee, and continue streaming gaming videos on their Twitch channel..\n\nIn November 2018, the Martins kids created a new YouTube channel called \"The Martin Boys\"' with no parents.\n\n\n"}

Jones and Jim Lewis, based on music and lyrics by the late Nigerian singer Fela Kuti, with additional music by Aaron Johnson and Jordan McLean and additional lyrics by Jim Lewis. It is based on events in the life of groundbreaking Nigerian composer and activist Fela Anikulapo Kuti. It portrays Kuti in the days when he was the target of 1,000 government soldiers assigned to end his public performances at the legendary Lagos nightclub The Shrine.\n\nThe musical ran Off-Broadway for one month in 2008. It premiered on Broadway at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on November 23, 2009, and ran until January 2011. The Off-Broadway production won the Lucille Lortel Awards for Best Musical, Outstanding Choreographer for Bill T. Jones, and Outstanding Costume Design for Marina Draghici. The Broadway production received eleven 2010 Tony Award nominations and won Best Choreography, Best Costume Design of a Musical, and Best Sound Design of a Musical.\n\n\"Fela!\" opened at the Off-Broadway 37 Arts Theatre B on September 4, 2008, and closed on October 5, 2008. It was conceived by Bill T. Jones, Steve Hendel and Jim Lewis, directed and choreographed by Jones. The production was designed by Marina Draghici (scenery and costumes) Robert Wierzel (lighting) Peter Nigrini (projection) and Robert Kaplowitz (sound). The cast featured Sahr Ngaujah as Fela and Abena Koomson as Funmilayo, Fela's mother.\n\nThe Broadway production began previews at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on October 19, 2009, and opened officially on November 23. Again directed and choreographed by Jones, the cast included Ngaujah and Kevin Mambo as Fela, Saycon Sengbloh and Michelle Williams as Sandra (Williams played Sandra in 2013) and Lillias White as Funmilayo. Patti LaBelle replaced Lillias White as Funmilayo on September 14, 2010. The production closed on January 2, 2011. The Broadway production received eleven Tony Award nominations, including one for Best Musical, the most of any production that season, along with the revival of \"La Cage aux Folles\".\n\nFor both productions, Kuti's music has been arranged and performed by the Brooklyn-based Antibalas and featuring the tenor saxophone soloist Stuart D. Bogie.\n\nThe London production, staged at the National Theatre's Olivier Theatre, began previews on November 6, 2010, with an opening night on November 16. It ran in repertoire with other National Theatre productions, and was simulcast internationally in 2011 as part of National Theatre Live. Sahr Ngaujah and Kevin Mambo appeared in the cast, as well as Dele Sosimi, Fela's former keyboard player, reprising his own role. In 2011 a production ran at Sadler's Wells in London's Islington.\n\n\"Fela!\" toured in North America. Its opening performance was held in September 2011 at the Harman Center for the Arts in Washington, D.C. The production opened in Canada in October 2011 at the Canon Theatre in Toronto, starring Sahr Ngaujah and Adesola Osakalumi, with a scheduled run until November 2011. From November to December 2011 it played at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco. From December 2011 to January 2012 the production played in the Ahmanson Theater of the Los Angeles Music Center, where it returned for a second run in April and May 2013. The musical had a limited return engagement on Broadway at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre from July 2012 to August 2012. The musical then continued on its world tour, playing in Australia, Japan, and a return to Africa, among other venues.\n\nThe 2008 Off-Broadway production received generally positive reviews. Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" observed: \nDavid Rooney of \"Variety\" stated: \"What it lacks in structure and concision [it] makes up for in heat, energy and sensuality. Like last season's \"Passing Strange\" and this summer's \"Hair\" revival, this dance-intensive bio-portrait aims to be less traditional musical theater than cathartic experience, lacing its communicative passion with infectious euphoria, rebellious anger and heartfelt despair.\" The review added: \"There perhaps could be more texture in the central character portrait, providing deeper insight into the radical showman, and anyone expecting a detailed life story may be disappointed. Fela's questionable attitudes toward women are suggested rather than explored, and his later life, his ongoing political activity and death from AIDS-related illness in 1997 are absent. [The action] is deftly integrated with Peter Nigrini's video projections to create a show that's invigoratingly messy, visceral and transporting.\" Les Gutman of the internet magazine \"CurtainUp\" was even more enthusiastic, calling the musical \"one of the most visually complete theatrical experiences imaginable\" and a \"true treasure\".\n\nThe touring production received a positive review from \"The Globe and Mail\"′s J. Kelly Nestruck, who cited Sahr Ngaujah's performance for particular praise, as \"channelling the life force of the titular singer\" in a \"sweat-soaked performance\". Nestruck observed that \n\nIn October 2010, radio journalist and disc jockey Tenisio \"DJ 5th Wurld\" Seanima asked the question \"Are \"FELA!\" musical producers headed for trouble?\" in an article describing potential copyright issues breached by the play's writers and producers. This prediction eventually became reality as Seanima later broke the story about \"Fela!\"'s producers being sued by writer and historian Carlos Moore, author of Fela's authorized biography entitled \"Fela, Fela! This Bitch of a Life!\" (London: Allison & Busby, 1982). In December 2011, the dispute between the producers and Moore was settled, it being agreed that all playbills and associated materials would henceforth bear an acknowledgement stating that the musical was inspired by Moore's book. A joint statement was issued announcing that \"the matter of Mr Moore’s claims has been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of the parties\". Moore had been suing for copyright infringement, and was alleged to have asked the courts to close the show. \n\nIn 2010 a lawsuit was also served on the producers of the show when New York photographer Marilyn Nance sought damages claiming the unauthorized use of one of her images.\n\n\"Fela!\" takes place around 1977, at the height of Fela Kuti's influence as a composer and performer in Nigeria. Kuti was an originator of the Afrobeat sound, and the musical opens with him addressing the audience from a concert at his club, the Afrika Shrine in Nigeria's largest city, Lagos. Kuti indicates that the Afrika Shrine had become a hugely popular venue, and a gathering place for youth opposed to Nigeria's military dictatorship. As one critic describes much of the first half of the show:\n\nKuti reveals how torn he is between his respect for the example set by his mother, Funmilayo, a teacher and Nigerian civil rights activist, and his quest for fame and sometimes hedonism. He gradually becomes more involved in open opposition to Nigeria's military regime, and his lyrics become overtly political. The regime responds to the provocation with increasingly violent retaliation. Kuti perseveres and releases \"Zombie\", an international hit openly critical of the Nigerian government. The show depicts the army raid of Kuti's compound (a commune he called Kalakuta Republic), reportedly by 1000 soldiers, which followed the release of \"Zombie\". The raid culminates with the torture of Kuti, his wives and other commune residents, and the murder of his mother. The show concludes with a protest staged by Kuti in October 1979, accompanied by his family and members of the Young African Pioneers. The protest was held on the day before General Olusegun Obasanjo was to retire from the Nigerian presidency for the first time. Kuti held Obasanjo responsible for his mother's death, and publicly defied the regime once again with his protest, leaving a symbolic coffin in front of Obasanjo's residence at the Dodan army barracks. The show concludes with symbolic coffins being laid on the stage to protest injustices suffered by the people of Nigeria and throughout Africa.\n\n"}

This commission released what became known as the \"Gansler Report\" in October 2007.\n\n\nWhen the \"Gansler Report\" was released on 31 October 2007, Dr. Gansler identified three key findings: not enough people, too little training, and an antiquated contracting system. This report did not address any suspected criminal cases being investigated internally within the Army and the Justice Department. Although the media recognized this effort as the broadest examination of the problems to date with potentially the most far-reaching recommendations for fixes, Congressional lawmakers were still concerned that the Army took too long in one of their recommendations, that of creating a special contracting corps, one that Congress authorized a few years prior.\n\nThe commission outlined four areas as critical to future success:\n"}

One significant graveyard orbit is a supersynchronous orbit well above geosynchronous orbit. Satellites are typically moved into such orbits at the end of their operational life to reduce the probability of colliding with operational spacecraft and generating space debris.\n\nA graveyard orbit is used when the change in velocity required to perform a de-orbit maneuver is too large. De-orbiting a geostationary satellite requires a delta-v of about , whereas re-orbiting it to a graveyard orbit only requires about .\n\nFor satellites in geostationary orbit and geosynchronous orbits, the graveyard orbit is a few hundred kilometers above the operational orbit. The transfer to a graveyard orbit above geostationary orbit requires the same amount of fuel as a satellite needs for about three months of stationkeeping. It also requires a reliable attitude control during the transfer maneuver. While most satellite operators try to perform such a maneuver at the end of their satellites' operational lives, through 2005 only about one-third succeeded. However, as of 2011, most recently decommissioned geosynchronous spacecraft were said to have been moved to a graveyard orbit.\n\nAccording to the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) the minimum perigee altitude formula_1 above the geostationary orbit is:\nwhere formula_3 is the solar radiation pressure coefficient and formula_4 is the aspect area [m²] to mass [kg] ratio of the satellite. This formula includes about 200 km for the GEO-protected zone to also permit orbit maneuvers in GEO without interference with the graveyard orbit. Another of tolerance must be allowed for the effects of gravitational perturbations (primarily solar and lunar). The remaining part of the equation considers the effects of the solar radiation pressure, which depends on the physical parameters of the satellite.\n\nIn order to obtain a license to provide telecommunications services in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires all geostationary satellites launched after March 18, 2002, to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life. U.S. government regulations require a boost, formula_5, of about 300 km.\n\nA spacecraft moved to a graveyard orbit will typically be passivated.\n\nUncontrolled objects in a near geostationary [earth] orbit (GEO) exhibit a 53-year cycle of orbital inclination due to the interaction of the earth's tilt with the lunar orbit.

{"id": "21476679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21476679", "title": "Herculaneum", "text": "Herculaneum\n\nLocated in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius, Herculaneum (Italian: \"Ercolano\") was an ancient Roman town destroyed by volcanic pyroclastic flows in 79 AD. Its ruins are located in the \"comune\" of Ercolano, Campania, Italy.\n\nHerculaneum is one of the few ancient cities to be preserved more or less intact, with no later accretions or modifications. Like its sister city, Pompeii, Herculaneum is famous for having been buried in lava and ash, along with Pompeii, Stabiae, Oplontis and Boscoreale, during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.\n\nUnlike Pompeii, the heavy blanket of lava that covered Herculaneum carbonized and thereby preserved wood and other organic-based materials such as roofs, beds, doors, and food. Although most of the residents had evacuated the city in advance of the lava, the well-preserved skeletons of 300 people who perished near the seawall were discovered in 1997.\n\nAlthough it was smaller than Pompeii, Herculaneum was a wealthier town than Pompeii, possessing an extraordinary density of fine houses with, for example, far more lavish use of coloured marble cladding.\n\nAncient tradition connected Herculaneum with the name of the Greek hero Heracles (\"Hercules\" in Latin and consequently Roman Mythology), an indication that the city was of Greek origin. In fact, it seems that some forefathers of the Samnite tribes of the Italian mainland founded the first civilization on the site of Herculaneum at the end of the 6th century BC. Soon after, the town came under Greek control and was used as a trading post because of its proximity to the Gulf of Naples. The Greeks named the city Ἡράκλειον, \"Heraklion\". In the 4th century BC, Herculaneum again came under the domination of the Samnites. The city remained under Samnite control until it became a Roman \"municipium\" in 89 BC, when, having participated in the Social War (\"War of The Allies\" against Rome), it was defeated by Titus Didius, a legate of Sulla.\n\nAfter the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, the town of Herculaneum was buried under approximately 20 metres (50–60 feet) of ash. It lay hidden and largely intact until discoveries from wells and underground tunnels became gradually more widely known, and notably following the Prince d'Elbeuf's explorations in the early 18th century. Excavations continued sporadically up to the present and today many streets and buildings are visible, although over 75% of the town remains buried. Today, the Italian towns of Ercolano and Portici lie on the approximate site of Herculaneum. Until 1969 the town of Ercolano was called Resina. It changed its name to Ercolano, the Italian modernisation of the ancient name in honour of the old city.\n\nThe inhabitants worshipped above all Hercules, who was believed to be the founder of both the town and Mount Vesuvius. Other important deities worshipped include Venus and Apollo, who are depicted in multiple statues in the city.\n\nThe catastrophic eruption of Mt. Vesuvius occurred on the afternoon of 24 August AD 79. Because Vesuvius had been dormant for approximately 800 years, it was no longer even recognized as a volcano.\n\nBased on archaeological excavations and on two letters of Pliny the Younger to the Roman historian Tacitus, the course of the eruption can be reconstructed.\n\nAt around 1pm on 24 August, Vesuvius began spewing volcanic ash and stone thousands of meters into the sky. When it reached the tropopause (the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere), the top of the cloud flattened, prompting Pliny to describe it to Tacitus as a stone pine tree. The prevailing winds at the time blew toward the southeast, causing the volcanic material to fall primarily on the city of Pompeii and the surrounding area. New studies have been carried out on the victims' skeletons and it has been established that some of the minerals stored in the bones are preserved.Since Herculaneum lay to the west of Vesuvius, it was only mildly affected by the first phase of the eruption. While roofs in Pompeii collapsed under the weight of falling debris, only a few centimeters of ash fell on Herculaneum, causing little damage but nonetheless prompting most inhabitants to flee. \n\nDuring the following night, the eruptive column which had risen into the stratosphere collapsed onto Vesuvius and its flanks. The first pyroclastic surge, formed by a mixture of ash and hot gases, billowed through the mostly evacuated town of Herculaneum at . A succession of six flows and surges buried the city's buildings, causing little damage in some areas and preserving structures, objects and victims almost intact. However, in other areas there was significant damage, knocking down walls, tearing away columns and other large objects; a marble statue of M. Nonius Balbus near the baths was blown 15 m away and a carbonised skeleton was found lifted 2.5 m above ground level in the garden of the House of the Relief of Telephus.\n\nRecent multidisciplinary research on the lethal effects of the pyroclastic surges in the Vesuvius area showed that in the vicinity of Pompeii and Herculaneum, heat was the main cause of the death of people who had previously been thought to have died by ash suffocation. This study shows that exposure to the surges, measuring at least 250 °C (482 °F) even at a distance of 10 kilometres from the vent, was sufficient to cause the instant death of all residents, even if they were sheltered within buildings.\n\nIn 1709 the digging of a deep well revealed some exceptional statues at the lowest levels which was later found to be the site of the theatre. The Prince d'Elbeuf purchased the land and proceeded to tunnel out from the bottom of the well, collecting any statues they could find. Among the earliest statues recovered were the two superbly sculpted Herculaneum Women now in the Dresden Skulpturensammlung.\n\nMajor excavation was resumed in 1738 by Spanish engineer Rocque Joaquin de Alcubierre. The elaborate publication of \"Le Antichità di Ercolano\" (\"The Antiquities of Herculaneum\") under the patronage of the King of the Two Sicilies had an effect on incipient European Neoclassicism out of all proportion to its limited circulation; in the later 18th century, motifs from Herculaneum began to appear on stylish furnishings, from decorative wall-paintings and tripod tables to perfume burners and teacups. However, excavation ceased once the nearby town of Pompeii was discovered, which was significantly easier to excavate because of the thinner layer of debris covering the site (4 m as opposed to Herculaneum's 20 m).\n\nBarker noted in his 1908 \"Buried Herculaneum\", \"By the orders of Francis I land was purchased, and in 1828 excavations were begun in two parts 150 feet apart, under the direction of the architect. Carlo Bonucci. In the year 1868 still further purchases of land were made, and excavations were carried on in an eastward direction till 1875. The total area now open measures 300 by 150 perches (1510 by 755 8 metres). The limits of the excavations to the north and east respectively are the modern streets of Vico di Mare and Vico Ferrara. It is here only that any portion of ancient Herculaneum may be seen in the open day.\"\n\nFrom 1927 until 1942 a new campaign of excavations was begun by Amedeo Maiuri, which exposed about four hectares of the ancient city in the archaeological park that is visible today.\n\nExcavation resumed briefly in the town in 1980–81 on the ancient shoreline following which the skeletons in the boathouses were found.\n\nFrom 1996–99 the large area to the north-west of the site was excavated and exposed, including part of the Villa of the Papyri, the north-west baths, the House of the Dionysian Reliefs and a large collapsed monument. This area was left in a chaotic state and from 2000–7 further work on conservation of this area was done.\n\nMany public and private buildings, including the forum complex, are yet to be excavated.\n\nThe buildings at the site are grouped in blocks (insulae), defined by the intersection of the east-west (cardi) and north-south (decumani) streets. Hence we have Insula II – Insula VII running counterclockwise from Insula II. To the east are two additional blocks: Orientalis I (oI) and Orientalis II (oII). To the south of Orientalis I (oI) lies one additional group of buildings known as the \"Suburban District\" (SD). Individual buildings having their own entrance number. For example, the House of the Deer is labelled (Ins IV, 3).\n\nThe first building in insula II is the House of Aristides. The entrance opens directly onto the atrium, but the remains of the house are not particularly well preserved due to damage caused by previous excavations. The lower floor was probably used for storage.\n\nThe second house in insula II got its name from a fresco of Argus and Io which once adorned a reception room off the large peristyle. The fresco is now lost, but its name lives on. This building must have been one of the finer villas in Herculaneum.\nThe discovery of the house in the late 1820s was notable because it was the first time a second floor had been unearthed in such detail. The excavation revealed a second floor balcony overlooking Cardo III, as well as wooden shelving and cupboards; however, with the passing of time, these elements have been lost.\n\nTo the north of the House of Argus lies the House of the Genius. It has been only partially excavated but it appears to have been a spacious building. The house derives its name from the statue of a cupid that formed part of a candlestick. In the centre of the peristyle are the remains of a rectangular basin.\n\nThe house is actually two buildings joined together. As a consequence of this it is a mixture of plain and simple rooms combined with some highly decorated ones.\n\nThe atrium is covered, so lacks the usual impluvium. It retains its original flooring of opus tesselatum and opus sectile. Off the atrium is a biclinium richly decorated with frescoes in the fourth style and a large triclinium which originally had a marble floor. A number of other rooms, one of which is the apsed alcove after which the house was named, can be reached via a hall which gets its light from a small courtyard.\n\nTemple of the augustales or priests of the Imperial cult.\n\nThe Central Thermae were bath houses built around the first century AD. Bath houses were very common at that time, especially in Pompeii and Herculaneum. Per common practice, there were two different bath areas, one for men and the other for women. These houses were extremely popular, attracting many visitors daily. This cultural hub was also home to several works of art, which can be found in various areas of the Central Thermae site.\n\nThe most famous of the luxurious villas at Herculaneum is the \"Villa of the Papyri.\" It was once identified as the magnificent seafront retreat for Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, Julius Caesar's father-in-law; however, the objects thought to be associated with Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesonius correspond more closely to a greatly standardized assemblage, and cannot indicate, with certainty, the owner of the villa. The villa stretches down towards the sea in four terraces. Piso, a literate man who patronized poets and philosophers, built a fine library there, the only one to survive intact from antiquity.\n\nBetween 1752 and 1754 a number of blackened unreadable papyrus scrolls were serendipitously recovered from the Villa of the Papyri by workmen. These scrolls became known as the Herculaneum papyri or scrolls, the majority of which are today stored at the National Library, Naples. The scrolls are badly carbonized, but a large number have been unrolled, with varying degrees of success. Computer-enhanced multi-spectral imaging, in the infra-red range, helps make the ink legible. There is now a real prospect that it will be possible to read the unopened rolls using X-rays. The same techniques could be applied to the rolls waiting to be discovered in the as-yet unexcavated part of the villa, eliminating the need for potentially damaging the rolls by unrolling them.\n\nA team spent a month in summer 2009, making numerous X-ray scans of two of the rolls that are stored at the French National Academy in Paris. They hoped that computer processing would convert the scans into digital images showing the interiors of the rolls and revealing the ancient writing. The main fear, however, was that the Roman writers might have used carbon-based inks, which would be essentially invisible to the scans.\nThat fear has turned out to be fact.\nThey had hoped that re-scanning the rolls with more powerful X-ray equipment would reveal the text. However, subsequent X-rays have still produced nothing legible. Still, the hundreds, possibly thousands of scrolls still buried at the site may yet prove to have legible text someday. As of 2016, research and experimentation has recovered more scrolls and it is suggested that new techniques will allow more to be read without unrolling them.\n\nIn 1981, under site administrator Dr. Giuseppe Maggi, excavations initially turned up more than 55 skeletons (30 adult males, 13 adult females and 12 children) on the beach and in the first six boat chambers. Because earlier excavations had revealed only a few skeletons, it was long thought that nearly all of the inhabitants had managed to escape, but this surprising discovery led to a change of view. The last inhabitants waiting for rescue from the sea were killed instantly by the intense heat, despite being sheltered from direct impact. The study of victims' postures and the effects on their skeletons indicate that the first surge caused instant death as a result of fulminant shock due to a temperature of about . The intense heat caused contraction of hands and feet and possibly fracture of bones and teeth.\n\nFurther excavations in the 1990s revealed a total of at least three hundred skeletons huddled close together in twelve arches facing the sea and on the beach, while the town was almost completely evacuated. The \"Ring Lady\" (see image), named for the rings on her fingers, was discovered in 1982.\n\nChemical analysis of the remains has led to greater insight into the health and nutrition of the Herculaneum population. Dr. Sara C. Bisel (1932–1996) was a physical anthropologist and classical archaeologist who played a prominent role in early scientific research at Herculaneum. Her pioneering work in the chemical and physical analysis of skeletons yielded new insights into the nutrition and health of ancient populations. This was considered ground-breaking and helped advance the field of paleodemography. Quantities of lead were found in some of the skeletons, which led some to speculation of lead poisoning. Also the presence of scarring on the pelvis, for instance, may give some indication of the number of children a woman had borne.\n\nCasts of skeletons were also produced, to replace the original bones after taphonomic study, scientific documentation and excavation. In contrast to Pompeii, where casts resembling the body features of the victims were produced by filling the body imprints in the ash deposit with plaster, the shape of corpses at Herculaneum could not be preserved, due to the rapid vaporization and replacement of the flesh of the victims by the hot ash (ca. 500 °C). A cast of the skeletons unearthed within chamber 10 is on display at the Museum of Anthropology in Naples. The most significant and extensive study of a sample of the skeletal remains of the Herculaneum victims is that published by Luigi Capasso in 2001. This study which employed X rays has superseded the earlier work by Bisel \n\nThe volcanic water, ash and debris covering Herculaneum, along with the extreme heat, left it in a remarkable state of preservation for over 1600 years. However, once excavations began, exposure to the elements began the slow process of deterioration. This was not helped by the methods of archaeology used earlier in the town's excavation, which generally centered around recovering valuable artifacts rather than ensuring the survival of all artifacts. In the early 1980s and under the direction of Dr. Sara C. Bisel, preservation of the skeletal remains became a high priority. The carbonised remains of organic materials, when exposed to the air, deteriorated over a matter of days, and destroyed many of the remains until a way of preserving them was formed.\n\nToday, tourism and vandalism have damaged many of the areas open to the public, and water damage coming from the modern Ercolano has undermined many of the foundations of the buildings. Reconstruction efforts have often proved counterproductive. However, in modern times conservation efforts have been more successful. Today excavations have been temporarily discontinued, in order to direct all funding to help save the city.\n\nA large number of artifacts from Herculaneum are preserved in the Naples National Archaeological Museum.\n\nA private-public partnership, the Herculaneum Conservation Project, has taken a lead restoring Herculaneum. In 2012, UNESCO’s director general praised Herculaneum as a model “whose best practices surely can be replicated in other similar vast archaeological areas across the world”\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15368", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15368", "title": "Insider trading", "text": "Insider trading\n\nInsider trading is the trading of a public company's stock or other securities (such as bonds or stock options) by individuals with access to nonpublic information about the company. In various countries, some kinds of trading based on insider information is illegal. This is because it is seen as unfair to other investors who do not have access to the information, as the investor with insider information could potentially make larger profits than a typical investor could make.\n\nThe authors of one study claim that illegal insider trading raises the cost of capital for securities issuers, thus decreasing overall economic growth. However, some economists, such as Henry Manne, have argued that insider trading should be allowed and could, in fact, benefit markets.\n\nTrading by specific insiders, such as employees, is commonly permitted as long as it does not rely on material information not in the public domain. Many jurisdictions require that such trading be reported so that the transactions can be monitored. In the United States and several other jurisdictions, trading conducted by corporate officers, key employees, directors, or significant shareholders must be reported to the regulator or publicly disclosed, usually within a few business days of the trade. In these cases, insiders in the United States are required to file a Form 4 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when buying or selling shares of their own companies.\n\nThe rules governing insider trading are complex and vary significantly from country to country. The extent of enforcement also varies from one country to another. The definition of insider in one jurisdiction can be broad, and may cover not only insiders themselves but also any persons related to them, such as brokers, associates and even family members. A person who becomes aware of non-public information and trades on that basis may be guilty of a crime.\n\nRules prohibiting or criminalizing insider trading on material non-public information exist in most jurisdictions around the world (Bhattacharya and Daouk, 2002), but the details and the efforts to enforce them vary considerably. In the United States, Sections 16(b) and 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 directly and indirectly address insider trading. The U.S. Congress enacted this law after the stock market crash of 1929. While the United States is generally viewed as making the most serious efforts to enforce its insider trading laws, the broader scope of the European model legislation provides a stricter framework against illegal insider trading. In the European Union and the United Kingdom all trading on non-public information is, under the rubric of market abuse, subject at a minimum to civil penalties and to possible criminal penalties as well. UK's Financial Conduct Authority has the responsibility to investigate and prosecute insider dealing, defined by the Criminal Justice Act 1993.\n\nIn the United States, Canada, Australia and Germany, for mandatory reporting purposes, corporate insiders are defined as a company's officers, directors and any beneficial owners of more than 10% of a class of the company's equity securities. Trades made by these types of insiders in the company's own stock, based on material non-public information, are considered fraudulent since the insiders are violating the fiduciary duty that they owe to the shareholders. The corporate insider, simply by accepting employment, has undertaken a legal obligation to the shareholders to put the shareholders' interests before their own, in matters related to the corporation. When insiders buy or sell based upon company-owned information, they are violating their obligation to the shareholders.\n\nFor example, illegal insider trading would occur if the chief executive officer of Company A learned (prior to a public announcement) that Company A will be taken over and then bought shares in Company A while knowing that the share price would likely rise.\n\nIn the United States and many other jurisdictions, however, \"insiders\" are not just limited to corporate officials and major shareholders where illegal insider trading is concerned but can include any individual who trades shares based on material non-public information in violation of some duty of trust. This duty may be imputed; for example, in many jurisdictions, in cases of where a corporate insider \"tips\" a friend about non-public information likely to have an effect on the company's share price, the duty the corporate insider owes the company is now imputed to the friend and the friend violates a duty to the company if he trades on the basis of this information.\n\nLiability for inside trading violations generally cannot be avoided by passing on the information in an \"I scratch your back; you scratch mine\" or quid pro quo arrangement if the person receiving the information knew or should have known that the information was material non-public information. In the United States, at least one court has indicated that the insider who releases the non-public information must have done so for an improper purpose. In the case of a person who receives the insider information (called the \"tippee\"), the tippee must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose.\n\nOne commentator has argued that if Company A's CEO did not trade on the undisclosed takeover news, but instead passed the information on to his brother-in-law who traded on it, illegal insider trading would still have occurred (albeit by proxy by passing it on to a \"non-insider\" so Company A's CEO would not get his hands dirty).\n\nA newer view of insider trading, the misappropriation theory, is now accepted in U.S. law. It states that anyone who misappropriates information from his or her employer and trades on that information in \"any\" stock (either the employer's stock or the company's competitor stocks) may be guilty of insider trading.\n\nProving that someone has been responsible for a trade can be difficult because traders may try to hide behind nominees, offshore companies, and other proxies. The Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutes over 50 cases each year, with many being settled administratively out of court. The SEC and several stock exchanges actively monitor trading, looking for suspicious activity. The SEC does not have criminal enforcement authority, but can refer serious matters to the U.S. Attorney's Office for further investigation and prosecution.\n\nIn the United States and most non-European jurisdictions not all trading on non-public information is illegal insider trading. For example, a person in a restaurant who hears the CEO of Company A at the next table tell the CFO that the company's profits will be higher than expected and then buys the stock is not guilty of insider trading—unless he or she had some closer connection to the company or company officers. However, even where the tippee is not himself an insider, where the tippee knows that the information is non-public and the information is paid for, or the tipper receives a benefit for giving it, then in the broader-scope jurisdictions the subsequent trading is illegal.\n\nNotwithstanding, information about a tender offer (usually regarding a merger or acquisition) is held to a higher standard. If this type of information is obtained (directly or indirectly) and there is reason to believe it is nonpublic, there is a duty to disclose it or abstain from trading.\n\nThe punishment for insider trading depends on a few different factors. There are three main factors, which can be identified. Depending on jurisdictions, there may be either civil or criminal penalties, or both.\n\nIn the United States in addition to civil penalties, the trader may also be subject to criminal prosecution for fraud or where SEC regulations have been broken, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) may be called to conduct an independent parallel investigation. If the DOJ finds criminal wrongdoing, the Department may file criminal charges.\n\nSince insiders are required to report their trades, others often track these traders, and there is a school of investing that follows the lead of insiders. Following such leads subjects the follower to the risk that an insider is buying specifically to increase investor confidence, or is selling for reasons unrelated to the health of the company (such as a desire to diversify or pay a personal expense).\n\nLegal trades by insiders are common, as employees of publicly traded corporations often have stock or stock options. These trades are made public in the United States through Securities and Exchange Commission filings, mainly Form 4.\n\nU.S. SEC Rule 10b5-1 clarified that the prohibition against insider trading does not require proof that an insider actually used material nonpublic information when conducting a trade; possession of such information alone is sufficient to violate the provision, and the SEC would infer that an insider in possession of material nonpublic information used this information when conducting a trade. However, SEC Rule 10b5-1 also created for insiders an affirmative defense if the insider can demonstrate that the trades conducted on behalf of the insider were conducted as part of a pre-existing contract or written binding plan for trading in the future.\n\nFor example, if an insider expects to retire after a specific period of time and, as part of retirement planning, the insider has adopted a written binding plan to sell a specific amount of the company's stock every month for two years, and the insider later comes into possession of material nonpublic information about the company, trades based on the original plan might not constitute prohibited insider trading.\n\nUntil the 21st century and the European Union's market abuse laws, the United States was the leading country in prohibiting insider trading made on the basis of material non-public information. Thomas Newkirk and Melissa Robertson of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) summarize the development of US insider trading laws. Insider trading has a base offense level of 8, which puts it in Zone A under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. This means that first-time offenders are eligible to receive probation rather than incarceration.\n\nU.S. insider trading prohibitions are based on English and American common law prohibitions against fraud. In 1909, well before the Securities Exchange Act was passed, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a corporate director who bought that company's stock when he knew the stock's price was about to increase committed fraud by buying but not disclosing his inside information.\n\nSection 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 contained prohibitions of fraud in the sale of securities, later greatly strengthened by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nSection 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits short-swing profits (from any purchases and sales within any six-month period) made by corporate directors, officers, or stockholders owning more than 10% of a firm's shares. Under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, SEC Rule 10b-5, prohibits fraud related to securities trading.\n\nThe Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 and the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 place penalties for illegal insider trading as high as three times the amount of profit gained or loss avoided from the illegal trading.\n\nSEC regulation FD (\"Fair Disclosure\") requires that if a company intentionally discloses material non-public information to one person, it must simultaneously disclose that information to the public at large. In the case of an unintentional disclosure of material non-public information to one person, the company must make a public disclosure \"promptly.\"\n\nInsider trading, or similar practices, are also regulated by the SEC under its rules on takeovers and tender offers under the Williams Act.\n\nMuch of the development of insider trading law has resulted from court decisions.\n\nIn 1909, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in \"Strong v. Repide\" that a director who expects to act in a way that affects the value of shares cannot use that knowledge to acquire shares from those who do not know of the expected action. Even though, in general, ordinary relations between directors and shareholders in a business corporation are not of such a fiduciary nature as to make it the duty of a director to disclose to a shareholder general knowledge regarding the value of the shares of the company before he purchases any from a shareholder, some cases involve special facts that impose such duty.\n\nIn 1968, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals advanced a \"level playing field\" theory of insider trading in \"SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.\" The court stated that anyone in possession of inside information must either disclose the information or refrain from trading. Officers of the Texas Gulf Sulphur Company had used inside information about the discovery of the Kidd Mine to make profits by buying shares and call options on company stock.\n\nIn 1984, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of \"Dirks v. Securities and Exchange Commission\" that tippees (receivers of second-hand information) are liable if they had reason to believe that the tipper had breached a fiduciary duty in disclosing confidential information. One such example would be if the tipper received any personal benefit from the disclosure, thereby breaching his or her duty of loyalty to the company. In \"Dirks\", the \"tippee\" received confidential information from an insider, a former employee of a company. The reason the insider disclosed the information to the tippee, and the reason the tippee disclosed the information to third parties, was to blow the whistle on massive fraud at the company. As a result of the tippee's efforts the fraud was uncovered, and the company went into bankruptcy. But, while the tippee had given the \"inside\" information to clients who made profits from the information, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not be held liable under the federal securities laws—for the simple reason that the insider from whom he received the information was not releasing the information for an improper purpose (a personal benefit), but rather for the purpose of exposing the fraud. The Supreme Court ruled that the tippee could not have been aiding and abetting a securities law violation committed by the insider—for the simple reason that no securities law violation had been committed by the insider.\n\nIn \"Dirks\", the Supreme Court also defined the concept of \"constructive insiders,\" who are lawyers, investment bankers and others who receive confidential information from a corporation while providing services to the corporation. Constructive insiders are also liable for insider trading violations if the corporation expects the information to remain confidential, since they acquire the fiduciary duties of the true insider.\n\nThe next expansion of insider trading liability came in \"SEC vs. Materia\" 745 F.2d 197 (2d Cir. 1984), the case that first introduced the misappropriation theory of liability for insider trading. Materia, a financial printing firm proofreader, and clearly not an insider by any definition, was found to have determined the identity of takeover targets based on proofreading tender offer documents during his employment. After a two-week trial, the district court found him liable for insider trading, and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed holding that the theft of information from an employer, and the use of that information to purchase or sell securities in another entity, constituted a fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of a securities. The misappropriation theory of insider trading was born, and liability further expanded to encompass a larger group of outsiders.\n\nIn \"United States v. Carpenter\" (1986) the U.S. Supreme Court cited an earlier ruling while unanimously upholding mail and wire fraud convictions for a defendant who received his information from a journalist rather than from the company itself. The journalist R. Foster Winans was also convicted, on the grounds that he had misappropriated information belonging to his employer, the \"Wall Street Journal\". In that widely publicized case, Winans traded in advance of \"Heard on the Street\" columns appearing in the Journal.\n\nThe Court stated in \"Carpenter\": \"It is well established, as a general proposition, that a person who acquires special knowledge or information by virtue of a confidential or fiduciary relationship with another is not free to exploit that knowledge or information for his own personal benefit but must account to his principal for any profits derived therefrom.\"\n\nHowever, in upholding the securities fraud (insider trading) convictions, the justices were evenly split.\n\nIn 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted the misappropriation theory of insider trading in \"United States v. O'Hagan\", 521 U.S. 642, 655 (1997). O'Hagan was a partner in a law firm representing Grand Metropolitan, while it was considering a tender offer for Pillsbury Company. O'Hagan used this inside information by buying call options on Pillsbury stock, resulting in profits of over $4.3 million. O'Hagan claimed that neither he nor his firm owed a fiduciary duty to Pillsbury, so he did not commit fraud by purchasing Pillsbury options.\n\nThe Court rejected O'Hagan's arguments and upheld his conviction.\n\nThe \"misappropriation theory\" holds that a person commits fraud \"in connection with\" a securities transaction and thereby violates 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, when he misappropriates confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary's undisclosed, self-serving use of a principal's information to purchase or sell securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of the information. In lieu of premising liability on a fiduciary relationship between company insider and purchaser or seller of the company's stock, the misappropriation theory premises liability on a fiduciary-turned-trader's deception of those who entrusted him with access to confidential information.\n\nThe Court specifically recognized that a corporation's information is its property: \"A company's confidential information ... qualifies as property to which the company has a right of exclusive use. The undisclosed misappropriation of such information in violation of a fiduciary duty ... constitutes fraud akin to embezzlement – the fraudulent appropriation to one's own use of the money or goods entrusted to one's care by another.\"\n\nIn 2000, the SEC enacted SEC Rule 10b5-1, which defined trading \"on the basis of\" inside information as any time a person trades while aware of material nonpublic information. It is no longer a defense for one to say that one would have made the trade anyway. The rule also created an affirmative defense for pre-planned trades.\n\nIn 2014, in the case of \"United States v. Newman\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit cited the Supreme Court's decision in \"Dirks\", and ruled that for a \"tippee\" (a person who used information they received from an insider) to be guilty of insider trading, the tippee must have been aware not only that the information was insider information, but must also have been aware that the insider released the information for an improper purpose (such as a personal benefit). The Court concluded that the insider's breach of a fiduciary duty not to release confidential information—in the absence of an improper purpose on the part of the insider—is not enough to impose criminal liability on either the insider or the tippee.\n\nIn 2016, in the case of \"Salman v. United States\", the U.S. Supreme Court held that the benefit a tipper must receive as predicate for an insider-trader prosecution of a tippee need not be pecuniary, and that giving a 'gift' of a tip to a family member is presumptively an act for the personal though intangible benefit of the tipper.\n\nMembers of the US Congress are exempt from the laws that ban insider trading. Because they generally do not have a confidential relationship with the source of the information they receive, however, they do not meet the usual definition of an \"insider.\" House of Representatives rules may however consider congressional insider trading unethical. A 2004 study found that stock sales and purchases by Senators outperformed the market by 12.3% per year. Peter Schweizer points out several examples of insider trading by members of Congress, including action taken by Spencer Bachus following a private, behind-the-doors meeting on the evening of September 18, 2008 when Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke informed members of Congress about the imminent financial crisis, Bachus then shorted stocks the next morning and cashed in his profits within a week. Also attending the same meeting were Senator Dick Durbin and John Boehner; the same day (trade effective the next day), Durbin sold mutual-fund shares worth $42,696, and reinvested it all with Warren Buffett. Also the same day (trade effective the next day), Congressman Boehner cashed out of an equity mutual fund.\n\nIn May 2007, a bill entitled the \"Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or STOCK Act\" was introduced that would hold congressional and federal employees liable for stock trades they made using information they gained through their jobs and also regulate analysts or \"Political Intelligence\" firms that research government activities. The 2012 STOCK Act was passed on April 4, 2012.\n\nIn 2014, federal prosecutors issued a subpoena to the House Ways and Means committee and Brian Sutter, staff director of its health-care sub-committee, relative to a price move in stocks just prior to the passage of a law favorable to the companies involved. An e-mail was sent out by a \"Washington-based policy-research firm that predicted the change [in the law] for its Wall Street clients. That alert, in turn, was based in part on information provided to the firm by a former congressional health-care aide turned lobbyist, according to emails reviewed by the \"[Wall Street] Journal\"\" in 2013.\n\nSecurity analysts gather and compile information, talk to corporate officers and other insiders, and issue recommendations to traders. Thus their activities may easily cross legal lines if they are not especially careful. The CFA Institute in its code of ethics states that analysts should make every effort to make all reports available to all the broker's clients on a timely basis. Analysts should never report material nonpublic information, except in an effort to make that information available to the general public. Nevertheless, analysts' reports may contain a variety of information that is \"pieced together\" without violating insider trading laws, under the Mosaic theory. This information may include non-material nonpublic information as well as material public information, which may increase in value when properly compiled and documented.\n\nSome economists and legal scholars (such as Henry Manne, Milton Friedman, Thomas Sowell, Daniel Fischel, and Frank H. Easterbrook) have argued that laws against insider trading should be repealed. They claim that insider trading based on material nonpublic information benefits investors, in general, by more quickly introducing new information into the market.\n\nFriedman, laureate of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, said: \"You want more insider trading, not less. You want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that.\" Friedman did not believe that the trader should be required to make his trade known to the public, because the buying or selling pressure itself is information for the market.\n\nOther critics argue that insider trading is a victimless act: a willing buyer and a willing seller agree to trade property that the seller rightfully owns, with no prior contract (according to this view) having been made between the parties to refrain from trading if there is asymmetric information. The Atlantic has described the process as \"arguably the closest thing that modern finance has to a victimless crime.\"\n\nLegalization advocates also question why \"trading\" where one party has more information than the other is legal in other markets, such as real estate, but not in the stock market. For example, if a geologist knows there is a high likelihood of the discovery of petroleum under Farmer Smith's land, he may be entitled to make Smith an offer for the land, and buy it, without first telling Farmer Smith of the geological data. \n\nAdvocates of legalization make free speech arguments. Punishment for communicating about a development pertinent to the next day's stock price might seem an act of censorship. If the information being conveyed is proprietary information and the corporate insider has contracted to not expose it, he has no more right to communicate it than he would to tell others about the company's confidential new product designs, formulas, or bank account passwords.\n\nSome authors have used these arguments to propose legalizing insider trading on negative information (but not on positive information). Since negative information is often withheld from the market, trading on such information has a higher value for the market than trading on positive information.\n\nThere are very limited laws against \"insider trading\" in the commodities markets if, for no other reason than that the concept of an \"insider\" is not immediately analogous to commodities themselves (corn, wheat, steel, etc.). However, analogous activities such as front running are illegal under US commodity and futures trading laws. For example, a commodity broker can be charged with fraud by receiving a large purchase order from a client (one likely to affect the price of that commodity) and then purchasing that commodity before executing the client's order to benefit from the anticipated price increase.\n\nThe advent of the Internet has provided a forum for the commercialisation of trading on insider information. In 2016 a number of dark web sites were identified as marketplaces where such non-public information was bought and sold. At least one such site used bitcoins to avoid currency restrictions and to impede tracking. Such sites also provide a place for soliciting for corporate informants, where non-public information may be used for purposes other than stock trading.\n\nThe US and the UK vary in the way the law is interpreted and applied with regard to insider trading. In the UK, the relevant laws are the Criminal Justice Act 1993, Part V, Schedule 1; the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which defines an offence of \"Market Abuse\"; and the European Union Regulation No 596/2014. The principle is that it is illegal to trade on the basis of market-sensitive information that is not generally known. This is a much broader scope that under U.S. law. The key differences from U.S. law are that no relationship to either the issuer of the security or the tipster is required; all that is required is that the guilty party traded (or caused trading) whilst having inside information, and there is no scienter requirement under UK law.\n\nJapan enacted its first law against insider trading in 1988. Roderick Seeman said, \"Even today many Japanese do not understand why this is illegal. Indeed, previously it was regarded as common sense to make a profit from your knowledge.\"\n\nIn Malta the law follows the European broader scope model. The relevant statute is the Prevention of Financial Markets Abuse Act of 2005, as amended. Earlier acts included the Financial Markets Abuse Act in 2002, and the Insider Dealing and Market Abuse Act of 1994.\n\nThe International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) paper on the \"Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation\" (updated to 2003) states that the three objectives of good securities market regulation are:\n\nThe discussion of these \"Core Principles\" state that \"investor protection\" in this context means \"Investors should be protected from misleading, manipulative or fraudulent practices, including insider trading, front running or trading ahead of customers and the misuse of client assets.\" More than 85 percent of the world's securities and commodities market regulators are members of IOSCO and have signed on to these Core Principles.\n\nThe World Bank and International Monetary Fund now use the IOSCO Core Principles in reviewing the financial health of different country's regulatory systems as part of these organization's financial sector assessment program, so laws against insider trading based on non-public information are now expected by the international community. Enforcement of insider trading laws varies widely from country to country, but the vast majority of jurisdictions now outlaw the practice, at least in principle.\n\nLarry Harris claims that differences in the effectiveness with which countries restrict insider trading help to explain the differences in executive compensation among those countries. The US, for example, has much higher CEO salaries than do Japan or Germany, where insider trading is less effectively restrained.\n\nIn 2014, the European Union (EU) adopted legislation (Criminal Sanctions for Market Abuse Directive) that harmonises criminal sanctions for insider dealing. All EU Member States agreed to introduce maximum prison sentences of at least four years for serious cases of market manipulation and insider dealing, and at least two years for improper disclosure of insider information.\n\nIn 2009, a journalist in Nettavisen (Thomas Gulbrandsen) was sentenced to 4 months in prison for insider trading.\n\nThe longest prison sentence in a Norwegian trial where the main charge was insider trading, was for eight years (two suspended) when Alain Angelil was convicted in a district court on December 9, 2011.\n\nAlthough insider trading in the UK has been illegal since 1980, it proved difficult to successfully prosecute individuals accused of insider trading. There were a number of notorious cases where individuals were able to escape prosecution. Instead the UK regulators relied on a series of fines to punish market abuses.\n\nThese fines were widely perceived as an ineffective deterrent (Cole, 2007), and there was a statement of intent by the UK regulator (the Financial Services Authority) to use its powers to enforce the legislation (specifically the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000). Between 2009–2012 the FSA secured 14 convictions in relation to insider dealing.\n\nRajat Gupta, who had been managing partner of McKinsey & Co. and a director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co., was convicted by a federal jury in 2012 of leaking inside information to hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. The case was prosecuted by the office of United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara.\n\nWith the guilty plea by Perkins Hixon in 2014 for insider trading from 2010-2013 while at Evercore Partners, Bharara said in a press release that 250 defendants whom his office had charged since August 2009 had now been convicted.\n\nOn December 10, 2014, a federal appeals court overturned the insider trading convictions of two former hedge fund traders, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, based on the \"erroneous\" instructions given to jurors by the trial judge. The decision was expected to affect the appeal of the separate insider-trading conviction of former SAC Capital portfolio manager Michael Steinberg and the U.S. Attorney and the SEC in 2015 did drop their cases against Steinberg and others.\n\nIn 2016, Sean Stewart, a former managing director at Perella Weinberg Partners LP and vice president at JPMorgan Chase, was convicted on allegations he tipped his father on pending health-care deals. The father, Robert Stewart, previously had pleaded guilty but didn’t testify during his son’s trial. It was argued that by way of compensation for the tip, the father had paid more than $10,000 for Sean's wedding photographer.\n\nIn 2017, Billy Walters, Las Vegas sports bettor, was convicted of making $40 million on private information of Dallas-based dairy processing company Dean Foods. Walters's source, company director Thomas C. Davis employing a prepaid cell phone and sometimes the code words \"Dallas Cowboys\" for Dean Foods, helped him from 2008 to 2014 realize profits and avoid losses in the stock, the Federal jury found. In the trial, investor Carl C. Icahn was mentioned in relation to Walters's trading but was not charged with wrongdoing. Golfer Phil Mickelson \"was also mentioned during the trial as someone who had traded in Dean Foods shares and once owed nearly $2 million in gambling debts to\" Walters. Mickelson \"made roughly $1 million trading Dean Foods shares; he agreed to forfeit those profits in a related civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission\". Walters's lawyer said he would appeal the verdict.\n\nIn 2008, police uncovered an insider trading conspiracy involving Bay Street and Wall Street lawyer Gil Cornblum and another lawyer, Stan Grmovsek, who were found to have gained over $10 million in illegal profits over a 14-year span. Cornblum committed suicide before criminal charges were laid. Grmovsek pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 39 months in prison. This was the longest term ever imposed for insider trading in Canada. These crimes were explored in Mark Coakley's 2011 non-fiction book, Tip and Trade.\n\nOn October 1, 2015, Chinese fund manager Xu Xiang was arrested due to insider trading.\n\nInsider Trading in India is an offense according to Section 195 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Sections 12A, 15G of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. Insider trading is when one with access to non public, price sensitive information about the securities of the company subscribes, buys, sells or deals, or agrees to do so or counsels another to do as principal or agent. Price sensitive information is information that materially affects the value of the securities.\nThe penalty for insider trading is imprisonment, which may extend to five years, and a minimum of five lakh rupees (five hundred thousand) to twenty five crore rupees (two hundred and fifty million) or three times the profit made, whichever is higher.\n\nInsider trading is legal as long as disclosure of the holdings and trading in securities of the company is done by the insiders. Any other connected person or group of connected persons shall also disclose their holdings under this regulation.\n\nThe gist of these rules is that an insider cannot trade on non-public information until that information is disclosed, and cannot tip people off using non-public information.\n\n1. Promoters, key managerial personnel and director of every company whose securities are listed on any recognized exchange shall disclose his holding of securities within 30 days of these regulations taking effect to the company.\n\n2. Every person on appointment as key managerial personnel, director of the company or upon becoming a promoter shall disclose his holding of securities of company within 7 days of such appointment to the company.\n\n3. Every promoter, director or employee of the company shall disclose to the company, the number of securities acquired or disposed of within two days of such transaction, if the value of securities traded through one transaction or series of transaction in a calendar quarter exceeds 10 lakh rupees or any other value as may be prescribed.\n\n4. Company needs to inform within two days of receipt of such disclosure to the stock exchange.\n\n5. Disclosure by the connected person shall be made as required by the company.\n\nUnder Republic Act 8799 or the Securities Regulation Code, insider trading in the Philippines is illegal.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Styling himself as a \"nationalist, fascist, theorist and supporter of white rights\", he ran a blog called \"The Daily Bale\" (\"Britons Against Left-wing Extremism\") which published several racist and anti-immigration hoaxes, as well as false accusations against his opponents. He has described himself as \"a proud anti-Semite\".\n\nBonehill-Paine's online activity has led to criminal charges being brought against him for harassment, antisemitic commentary and hoaxing, including a 2013 online hoax that led to the owners of a Leicester pub receiving death threats, and other false accusations, for which he received a suspended prison sentence. He was described as an \"internet troll\" by the prosecutor at a 2014 court hearing. He was arrested in June 2015 for inciting racial hatred against Jews, for which he was found guilty in December, receiving a jail sentence of three years and four months. In 2016, he was sentenced to two years in prison for racially-aggravated harassment to be served in addition to his first sentence, and was serving his sentence at HM Prison Wayland.\n\nA former public schoolboy and briefly a Conservative Party member, Bonehill-Paine was sentenced to a 12-month community order with 100 hours' unpaid work and supervision by the probation service, following an incident on 11 March 2011 in which he broke into and burgled a police station in Chard, Somerset, using his Conservative Party membership card, while drunk. He was discovered by a constable outside the station in the early hours wearing a police uniform, and noted their poor security. He resisted efforts to arrest him, assaulting two officers in the process, and was found guilty of the offences of burglary, assault and criminal damage, also pleading guilty to criminal damage committed on 30 March to a flower bed in Yeovil.\n\nIn 2013, Bonehill-Paine announced plans to lead a \"Stand Strong\" march in Woolwich, a month after the murder of Lee Rigby, describing it as a protest against \"extremism, terrorism and oppression\".\n\nIn February 2014, Bonehill-Paine appeared in court in Yeovil on charges of malicious communications on Facebook which he had made about the UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage in the previous October. That September, Bonehill-Paine announced that he was in the process of registering a political party in Yeovil, called the National British Resistance party. He described it as having \"ambitions to replace the British National Party and gain mainstream support\", with the intention of contesting elections in 2015. Also that year, he released a video of himself speaking at a British National Party meeting, delivering a call to \"rise up and stand up as one white race united\" to a small group of people in a pub. By 2015, he was reportedly a member of National Action.\n\nBonehill-Paine's blog, \"The Daily Bale\", ran hoax stories which were repeated as fact on social media. A story from \"The Daily Bale\" went viral in August 2013, falsely reporting that The Globe pub in Leicester had refused to admit members of the armed forces, so as not to offend immigrants. People who had read the story threatened the pub with arson and its staff with murder. Bonehill-Paine stated in an interview that his intention was to create \"a shocking campaign\" that people would \"share quickly on social media\". Security expert Graham Cluley called the stunt \"utterly irresponsible and frankly moronic\". In April 2014, Bonehill-Paine was sentenced to 180 hours of unpaid work and two years supervision for malicious communications over this incident. A year later, for breaching this community order, magistrates added another 10 hours of unpaid work to the sentence.\n\nIn February 2014, a hoax story about a six-year-old girl from Croydon being kidnapped by an Asian child grooming gang was shared on social media. A September 2014 story made false claims about an Asian youth punching a baby and throwing it against a wall, which Bonehill-Paine later said had been written by an English Defence League member and published \"without researching the actual article first\". The next month, Bonehill-Paine's blog spread a hoax that a Somali immigrant with Ebola had gone missing in Leicester. A fake NHS poster making this claim was publicised by Bonehill-Paine's website, reportedly distributed by one of his supporters in Leicester, and seen in a medical centre in the city.\n\nIn October 2014, he pleaded guilty to charges of malicious communications and harassment relating to articles on his \"Daily Bale\" blog falsely claiming that innocent people were paedophiles, drug dealers or religious zealots. During one hearing, he took issue with being called an \"Internet troll\" by the prosecutor, Dafydd Paxton. Sentencing was postponed until 12 January 2015 due to other \"very serious\" investigations involving him, including alleged incitement to racial hatred against a Member of Parliament, and later postponed again until 5 February. The hearing eventually took place on 9 February 2015, when he was given a three-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months, in addition to 80 hours' unpaid work and ten sessions of \"education, training and employment\". He was ordered to pay £85 costs and a victim surcharge of £80.\n\nIn February 2015, Bonehill-Paine was due to be charged in St Albans under s.38 of the Public Order Act 1986, the \"contamination of goods\", for publishing an article on his website suggesting that fruit and vegetables from Tesco were infected with Ebola. The offence carries a maximum 10-year sentence. In October 2015, he was tried at Stevenage Magistrates' Court for \"misusing a public computer network to propagate grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing material\" in two online articles, one being the Tesco Ebola hoax and the other encouraging the immediate killing of disabled babies for the purpose of eugenics. The district judge cleared him of both charges citing the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Human Rights Act.\n\nIn April 2015, Bonehill-Paine claimed to have been the man arrested and released on bail on suspicion of sending \"hate\" tweets to Jack Monroe, a \"Guardian\" columnist. The tweets were made by a hoax account purporting to be from a former UKIP candidate, and UKIP reported the account to the police. In a statement on his website, Bonehill-Paine did not admit responsibility, but said that the tweets were \"of a comical nature and [I] commend the level of free speech used\".\n\nIn May 2015, Bonehill-Paine pleaded not guilty to a charge of harassment after it was alleged that he had left a swastika in the home of a Hertfordshire woman with whom he had spent two nights, describing it as a gift that had been touched by Adolf Hitler, before sending her a string of abusive messages and letters and asking her to become \"his Eva\". The case was adjourned until 15 July.\n\nIn January 2015, Bonehill-Paine called for a \"mass protest\" in March that year against what he perceived as the \"complete Jewification\" of Stamford Hill in north London, an area with the UK's largest ultra-orthodox Charedi population, with particular focus on the volunteer neighbourhood watch group, Shomrim, which he falsely asserts is an illegal religious police force. The Community Security Trust (CST) was in talks with local police, and local Jewish leaders were described as calm about the threat. Dave Rich, a CST spokesman said that Bonehill-Paine had \"a long record of racist provocation and antisemitic abuse but he doesn't have much record of being able to mobilise large numbers of people on the street\". Bonehill-Paine's protest was later cancelled due to lack of support.\n\nIn February 2015, Bonehill-Paine was arrested by police officers investigating allegations of inciting racial hatred relating to \"two visual and written publications on the internet\", and released on bail. He was arrested on suspicion of \"racially aggravated harassment and malicious communications\".\n\nIn June 2015, Bonehill-Paine announced his intention to join a New Dawn Party demonstration in Golders Green, an area of north London with a large Jewish minority, on Saturday 4 July 2015. Bonehell stated his intention to destroy Israeli flags by hand and tread upon them (believing that by not burning the flags he could \"avoid prosecution\") and said he would be burning copies of the \"Talmud\", a Jewish holy book, in a \"private ceremony\". Posts to Bonehill-Paine's website featured Auschwitz-Birkenau imagery and said that the demonstration would be an \"absolute gas\". On 25 June, he was arrested by the Metropolitan Police and charged with inciting racial hatred contrary to the Public Order Act 1986. Four days later, he was remanded in custody at Westminster Magistrates' Court. He was refused bail at a Southwark Crown Court hearing on 13 July. At the next hearing on 21 September, he pleaded \"absolutely not guilty\" and was again remanded in custody.\n\nThe trial began at Southwark Crown Court on 14 December 2015. Mark Weekes for the prosecution described a poster on Bonehill-Paine's website which he invited visitors to print off to publicise the intended march on 4 July. The poster included an image of Auschwitz and a stereotyped cartoon of a Jewish man being sprayed with weedkiller, under the slogan \"Join us on July 4 for what promises to be an absolute gas!\" with an SS lightning bolt in the ‘O’ of Golders Green. Weekes said the poster \"trivialises and mocks the death of millions of Jews during the Third Reich\" and considered the use of Nazi imagery in reference to an area with a large Jewish population to be \"incitement\". On 16 December, Bonehill-Paine was convicted of inciting racial hatred against Jews. He was sentenced to three years and four months imprisonment.\n\nBonehill-Paine was held at HM Prison Manchester and HM Prison Wandsworth. In January 2016, he was investigated by the Prison Service for letters to fans, inside envelopes with drawings of Hitler, the September 11 attacks and Harold Shipman. In the letters, he mocked taxpayers for the £120,000 costs of holding him in prison and spoke of plans to stand for election as a member of parliament in Bradford when eligible five years after his release. The Appeal Court upheld the length of Bonehill-Paine's sentence in May 2016. He also spoke of a desire to run for MP of Yeovil, his home constituency, in order to build a \"rural utopia\" that would \"ignite the fire\" to spread throughout the country.\n\nIn October 2014, Bonehill-Paine was investigated by police over antisemitic comments about the Labour MP Luciana Berger published on his website, after Garron Helm, a member of National Action, was imprisoned for sending antisemitic messages to her.\n\nOn 15 February 2015, it was reported that Bonehill-Paine had been arrested on suspicion of having sent antisemitic tweets to Berger. On 14 June 2016, he was charged with the racially or religiously aggravated harassment of Berger between October 2014 and February 2015. At a hearing at the Old Bailey on 19 July 2016, with Bonehill-Paine participating via a video link, he was sent for trial.\n\nThe trial began on 5 December 2016. The court was told that Bonehill-Paine had posted five \"hateful and insulting\" articles about the woman he blamed for the jailing of a far-right extremist he regarded as a comrade. His defence counsel said Bonehill-Paine would not be giving evidence at the trial, but asserted that the defendant in posting his \"pathetic, puerile rubbish\" was, however, living in a country \"where everyone is entitled to a voice\".\n\nOn 7 December 2016, Bonehill-Paine was convicted of racially-aggravated harassment. The following day, he was imprisoned for two years, this new custodial term to be added to the existing sentence. A criminal behaviour order was imposed to restrict his internet use after his eventual release, including the barring of any attempt to contact Berger and other listed individuals, and the police were authorised to monitor his online activities for five years.\n"}

It takes much of its inspiration from medieval sources, particularly Cornish passion plays, as well as Breton and to a lesser extent Welsh. It was subsequently adopted by the Cornish Language Board as their preferred system. It retained a Middle Cornish base but made the spelling more systematic by applying phonemic orthographic theory, and for the first time set out clear rules relating spelling to pronunciation. Before the Standard Written Form was introduced in 2008, users of KK claimed that the orthography had been taken up enthusiastically by the majority of Cornish speakers and learners, and advocates of this orthography claimed that it was especially welcomed by teachers. This assuption was comfirmed in 2008, when a survey indicated that KK users made up more than half of all Cornish speakers After KK's introduction, many Cornish speakers chose to continue using Unified Cornish, and many moved to Revived Late Cornish.\n\nThe orthography has drawn heavy criticism from some areas. Since the publication of the \"Gerlyver Kernewek Kemmyn\" (dictionary), several writers have condemned the new orthography (Penglase 1994; Williams 1996; Mills 1999). Some supporters of KK claim that its phonetic spelling makes it easier to teach, and that its reconstructed phonology is grounded in the historic corpus of medieval Cornish literature.\n\nNotably several writers have criticised George's reconstructed phonology, claiming it to be academically unsound. In 1994, Charles Penglase berated the lack of authenticity in KK resulting out of George's purely conjectural reconstruction of Middle Cornish phonology. In 1995, Nicholas Williams listed some 25 ways in which he believes the phonology and spelling of KK to be erroneous. In 1999, Jon Mills gives examples of numerous inaccuracies in George's data and shows how the English translation equivalents and neologisms given in the \"Gerlyver Kernewek Kemmyn\" entail a contrastive lexicology that is at odds with traditional practice as attested in the historical corpus of Cornish.\n\nAnother issue, which has caused controversy is that of Cornish placenames. In many instances, there are multiple, conflicting etymologies and possible meanings, but KK has tended to respell these according to one theory or another. This respelling not only can obscure an alternative origin or meaning, but is not always in line with the practice of other forms of revived Cornish.\n\nWhile its users claim it to be the largest, and so most successful, variety of Cornish, a survey in 2008 indicated that KK users only make up roughly half of all Cornish speakers. However 73.9% of \"competent and frequent\" writers of Cornish used KK, and 69.6% of them preferred to use KK. 70.4% of \"competent and frequent\" readers were found to prefer to read KK. Despite this, it has drawn heavy criticism from some areas, particularly its rival forms, Unified Cornish (\"Unyes\") and Modern Cornish, although the survey found that \"competent and frequent\" writers of these forms of Cornish made up only 18.3% and 10.4% respectively.\n\nIn 1987 Kesva an Taves Kernewek (\"Cornish Language Board\") voted to adopt the Kernewek Kemmyn form of Cornish as its standard.\n\nWhile the various varieties of revived Cornish have had a rocky relationship with one another, this has had the positive effect of creating a publishing and writing boom in Cornish. All of them have been used in constructing the Cornish language Wikipedia, and also in Gorseth Kernow, the Cornish \"Gorsedd\".\n\nThe pronunciation of traditional Cornish is a matter of conjecture, but users of Revived Middle Cornish are more or less agreed about the phonology they use.\n\nThis is a table of the phonology of Revived Middle Cornish (RMC) as recommended for the pronunciation of Kernewek Kemmyn orthography, using symbols from the (IPA).\nThese are tables of the phonology of Revived Middle Cornish as recommended for the pronunciation of Kernewek Kemmyn, using symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\nThe vowels with their corresponding letters in the Kernewek Kemmyn orthography and the short/long pairs are as follows:\n\nNotes:\n1.

{"id": "18383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18383", "title": "Leonids", "text": "Leonids\n\nThe Leonids ( ) are a prolific meteor shower associated with the comet Tempel–Tuttle. The Leonids get their name from the location of their radiant in the constellation Leo: the meteors appear to radiate from that point in the sky. Their proper Greek name should be Leon\"t\"ids (Λεοντίδαι, \"Leontídai\"), but the word was initially constructed as a Greek/Latin hybrid and it has been used since. They peak in the month of November.\n\nEarth moves through the meteoroid stream of particles left from the passages of a comet. The stream comprises solid particles, known as meteoroids, ejected by the comet as its frozen gases evaporate under the heat of the Sun when it is close enough – typically closer than Jupiter's orbit. The Leonids are a fast moving stream which encounter the path of Earth and impact at 72 km/s. Larger Leonids which are about 10 mm across have a mass of half a gram and are known for generating bright (apparent magnitude −1.5) meteors. An annual Leonid shower may deposit 12 or 13 tons of particles across the entire planet.\n\nThe meteoroids left by the comet are organized in trails in orbits similar to though different from that of the comet. They are differentially disturbed by the planets, in particular Jupiter and to a lesser extent by radiation pressure from the sun, the Poynting–Robertson effect, and the Yarkovsky effect. These trails of meteoroids cause meteor showers when Earth encounters them. Old trails are spatially not dense and compose the meteor shower with a few meteors per minute. In the case of the Leonids, that tends to peak around November 18, but some are spread through several days on either side and the specific peak changes every year. Conversely, young trails are spatially very dense and the cause of meteor outbursts when the Earth enters one. Meteor storms (large outbursts) exceed 1000 meteors per hour, to be compared to the sporadic background (5 to 8 meteors per hour) and the shower background (several per hour).\n\nThe Leonids are famous because their meteor showers, or storms, can be among the most spectacular. Because of the storm of 1833 and the recent developments in scientific thought of the time (see for example the identification of Halley's Comet) the Leonids have had a major effect on the development of the scientific study of meteors, which had previously been thought to be atmospheric phenomena. Though it has been suggested the meteor shower-storm has been noted in ancient times it was the meteor storm of 1833 that broke into people's modern day awareness – it was of truly superlative strength. One estimate is over one hundred thousand meteors an hour, but another, done as the storm abated, estimated in excess of 240,000 meteors during the nine hours of the storm over the entire region of North America east of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nIt was marked by several nations of Native Americans: the Cheyenne established a peace treaty and the Lakota calendar was reset. Abolitionists including Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass as well as slave-owners took note and others. The New York Evening Post carried a series of articles on the event including reports from Canada to Jamaica, it made news in several states beyond New York and though it appeared in North America was talked about in Europe. The journalism of the event tended to rise above the partisan debates of the time and reviewed facts as they could be sought out. Abraham Lincoln commented on it years later. Near Independence, Missouri, in Clay County, a refugee Mormon community watched the meteor shower on the banks of the Missouri River after having been driven from their homes by local settlers. The founder and first leader of Mormonism, Joseph Smith, afterwards noted in his journal his belief that this event was a literal fulfillment of the word of God and a sure sign that the coming of Christ was close at hand. Though it was noted in the midwest and eastern areas it was also noted in the far west.\n\nDenison Olmsted explained the event most accurately. After spending the last weeks of 1833 collecting information, he presented his findings in January 1834 to the \"American Journal of Science and Arts\", published in January–April 1834, and January 1836. He noted the shower was of short duration and was not seen in Europe, and that the meteors radiated from a point in the constellation of Leo and he speculated the meteors had originated from a cloud of particles in space. Accounts of the 1866 repeat of the Leonids counted hundreds per minute/a few thousand per hr in Europe. The Leonids were again seen in 1867, when moonlight reduced the rates to 1000 per hour. Another strong appearance of the Leonids in 1868 reached an intensity of 1000 per hour in dark skies. It was in 1866–67 that information on Comet Tempel-Tuttle was gathered pointing it out as the source of the meteor shower. When the storms failed to return in 1899, it was generally thought that the dust had moved on and storms were a thing of the past.\n\nThen, in 1966, a spectacular storm was seen over the Americas. Historical notes were gathered thus noting the Leonids back to 900AD. Radar studies showed the 1966 storm included a relatively high percentage of smaller particles while 1965's lower activity had a much higher proportion of larger particles. In 1981 Donald K. Yeomans of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory reviewed the history of meteor showers for the Leonids and the history of the dynamic orbit of Comet Tempel-Tuttle. A graph from it was adapted and re-published in Sky and Telescope. It showed relative positions of the Earth and Tempel-Tuttle and marks where Earth encountered dense dust. This showed that the meteoroids are mostly behind and outside the path of the comet, but paths of the Earth through the cloud of particles resulting in powerful storms were very near paths of nearly no activity. But overall the 1998 Leonids were in a favorable position so interest was rising.\n\nLeading up to the 1998 return, an airborne observing campaign was organized to mobilize modern observing techniques by Peter Jenniskens at NASA Ames Research Center. There were also efforts to observe impacts of meteoroids, as an example of transient lunar phenomenon, on the Moon in 1999. A particular reason to observe the Moon is that our vantage from a location on Earth sees only meteors coming into the atmosphere relatively close to us while impacts on the Moon would be visible from across the Moon in a single view. The sodium tail of the Moon tripled just after the 1998 Leonid shower which was composed of larger meteoroids (which in the case of the Earth was witnessed as fireballs.) However, in 1999 the sodium tail of the Moon did not change from the Leonid impacts.\n\nResearch by Kondrat'eva, Reznikov and colleagues at Kazan University had shown how meteor storms could be accurately predicted, but for some years the worldwide meteor community remained largely unaware of these results. The work of David J. Asher, Armagh Observatory and Robert H. McNaught, Siding Spring Observatory and independently by Esko Lyytinen in 1999, following on from the Kazan research, is considered by most meteor experts as the breakthrough in modern analysis of meteor storms. Whereas previously it was hazardous to guess if there would be a storm or little activity, the predictions of Asher and McNaught timed bursts in activity down to ten minutes by narrowing down the clouds of particles to individual streams from each passage of the comet, and their trajectories amended by subsequent passage near planets. However, whether a specific meteoroid trail will be primarily composed of small or large particles, and thus the relative brightness of the meteors, was not understood. But McNaught did extend the work to examine the placement of the Moon with trails and saw a large chance of a storm impacting in 1999 from a trail while there were less direct impacts from trails in 2000 and 2001 (successive contact with trails through 2006 showed no hits.)\n\nViewing campaigns resulted in spectacular footage from the 1999, 2001 and 2002, storms producing up to 3,000 Leonid meteors per hour. Predictions for the Moon's Leonid impacts also noted that in 2000 the side of the Moon facing the stream was away from the Earth but that impacts should be in number enough to raise a cloud of particles kicked off the Moon by impacts would cause a detectable increase in the sodium tail of the Moon. Research using the explanation of meteor trails/streams have explained the storms of the past. The 1833 storm was not due to the recent passage of the comet, but from a direct impact with the previous 1800 dust trail. The meteoroids from the 1733 passage of Comet Tempel-Tuttle resulted in the 1866 storm and the 1966 storm was from the 1899 passage of the comet. The double spikes in Leonid activity in 2001 and in 2002 were due to the passage of the comet's dust ejected in 1767 and 1866. This ground breaking work was soon applied to other meteor showers – for example the 2004 June Bootids. Peter Jenniskens has published predictions for the next 50 years. However, a close encounter with Jupiter is expected to perturb the comet's path, and many streams, making storms of historic magnitude unlikely for many decades. Recent work tries to take into account the roles of differences in parent bodies and the specifics of their orbits, ejection velocities off the solid mass of the core of a comet, radiation pressure from the sun, the Poynting–Robertson effect, and the Yarkovsky effect on the particles of different sizes and rates of rotation to explain differences between meteor showers in terms of being predominantly fireballs or small meteors.\nPredictions until the end of the 21st century have been published by Mikhail Maslov.\n\nTwo appearances of the Leonids frame the story of the novel Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthy.\n\nThe 1833 shower is referenced in the fourth section of William Faulkner's short story \"The Bear,\" as published in his novel Go Down, Moses. As Ike reads the entries chronicling the slaves owned by his family, the recording for Tomy lists her death as June 1833, \"Yr stars fell.\"\n\nIn \"Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire\", the Leonid is referenced as the Litleonids meteor shower (named after the Pokémon species Litleo). This has a big impact in an event in its post game named \"The Delta Episode\" in which one of the meteors contain Deoxys.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24586623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24586623", "title": "Nazino affair", "text": "Nazino affair\n\nThe Nazino affair () was the mass deportation of 6,000 people to Nazino Island in the Soviet Union in May 1933. The deportees, mostly political prisoners and petty criminals, were forcibly sent to the small, isolated island in Western Siberia, located northwest of Tomsk, to construct a \"special settlement\". They were abandoned with only flour for food, and little in the way of tools, clothing, or shelter, and those who attempted to leave were killed by armed guards. The conditions of the island led to widespread disease, abuse of power, violence, and cannibalism. Within thirteen weeks, over 4,000 of the deportees related to Nazino Island had died or disappeared, and a majority of the survivors were in ill health.\n\nThe Nazino affair was virtually unknown until 1988, when an investigation by Memorial began during the \"glasnost\" reforms in the Soviet Union. The events were popularized in 2002 when reports of a September 1933 special commission by the Communist Party of Western Siberia were published by Memorial. \n\nIn February 1933, Genrikh Yagoda, head of the OGPU secret police, and Matvei Berman, head of the GULAG labor camp system, proposed a self-described \"grandiose plan\" to Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Soviet Union, to resettle up to 2,000,000 people to Siberia and Kazakhstan in \"special settlements.\" The deportees, or \"settlers,\" were to bring over a million hectares of virgin land in the sparsely populated regions into production, and become self-sufficient within two years.\n\nYagoda and Berman's plan was based on the experience of deporting 2,000,000 kulaks (wealthier land owning peasants) and other agricultural workers to the same areas that had occurred in the previous three years as part of the Dekulakization policy. However, unlike the previous plan, resources available to support the new plan were severely limited by the ongoing famine in the Soviet Union. Despite this, the new plan was approved by the Soviet Council of People's Commissars of the USSR on 11 March 1933. Shortly after the plan's approval, the number of prospective deportees was reduced to 1,000,000 deportees.\n\nThe original plan targeted several types of kulaks, peasants, \"urban elements,\" people living in the agricultural areas of Soviet Union's western territories such as the Ukrainian SSR, and the Lower Volga, North Caucasus and Black Earth Region in the Russian SFSR. Instead, many of the deportees were people from Moscow and Leningrad who had been unable to obtain an internal passport. The passportization campaign in the Soviet Union began with a decision by the Politburo on December 27, 1932 to issue internal passports to all residents of major cities, and one of their objectives was to \"cleanse Moscow, Leningrad and the other great urban centers of the USSR of superfluous elements not connected with production or administrative work, as well as kulaks, criminals, and other antisocial and socially dangerous elements.\"\n\nDeportees were primarily \"Déclassé and socially harmful elements\", meaning former merchants and traders, peasants who had fled the famine in the countryside, petty criminals, or anybody who did not fit into the idealized communist class structure. Their backgrounds meant they were not issued passports, and they could be arrested and deported from the cities after a summary administrative procedure. Most of the arrestees were deported within two days. Between March and July 1933, 85,937 people living in Moscow were arrested and deported because they lacked passports, while 4,776 people living in Leningrad were also deported. Those arrested in connection with the cleansing of Moscow prior to the May 1, 1933 May Day holiday were assigned to the transit camp in the city of Tomsk.\n\nAccording to the plan of Yagoda and Berman, the deportees would pass through transit camps at Tomsk, Omsk, and Achinsk. The largest camp was at Tomsk, which had to be rebuilt from scratch, starting in April to hold 15,000 deportees. 25,000 deportees arrived in April even though the camp was not scheduled to be completed until May 1. River transport to the final labor camps was closed until the start of May until ice on the Ob and Tom Rivers cleared. Most of the first arrivals were kulaks and other agricultural workers, and people from southern Russian cities. The arrival of so many deportees panicked Tomsk authorities, who viewed them as \"starving and contagious.\"\n\nA report by Vassily Arsenievich Velichko, the local Communist Party head in Narymsky District of the West Siberian Krai, gave 22 examples of people who had been deported:\n\nA rail convoy holding déclassé deportees left Moscow on April 30, and a similar convoy left Leningrad on April 29, with both arriving on May 10. The daily food ration during the trip was 300 grams of bread per person. Criminal groups among the deportees beat the other deportees and stole their food and clothing. The authorities in Tomsk were unfamiliar with urban deportees, and expected trouble from them, so decided to send them to the most isolated work sites. Two nights after their arrival in Tomsk a disturbance broke out, as they demanded drinking water, which was put down by mounted troops. Many of the urban deportees were later sent to Nazino Island (), a river island on the Ob River located north of Tomsk, in a particularly empty part of Western Siberia inhabited by only a small number of indigenous Ostyak people. Four river barges, which were designed to haul timber, were filled with about 5,000 deportees on May 14 1933. About a third of the deportees were criminals who were sent in order to \"decongest the prisons.\" About half were déclassé people from Moscow and Leningrad. The authorities who were to be in charge of the labor camps were first informed that they would be sent on May 5. These authorities had never worked with urban deportees and had no resources or supplies to support them. The deportees were kept below decks on the barges and apparently fed a daily ration of 200 grams of bread per person. Twenty tons of flour - about four kilos per person - were also transported, but the barges contained no other food, cooking utensils, or tools. All supervisory personnel, two commanders and fifty guards, were newly recruited and had no shoes or uniforms.\n\nThe barges unloaded their passengers during the afternoon of May 18, on Nazino Island, a swampy island about 3 km long and 600 meters wide. There was no roster of the disembarking deportees, but on arrival 322 women and 4,556 men were counted, plus 27 bodies of those who died during the trip from Tomsk. Over a third of the deportees were too weak to stand on arrival. About 1,200 additional deportees arrived on May 27. A fight broke out and guards fired on the deportees as the twenty tons of flour were deposited on the island and distribution began. The flour was moved to the shore opposite the island and distribution on the island was tried again the next morning, with another fight and more firing resulting. Afterward, all flour was distributed via \"brigadiers\" who collected flour for their brigade of about 150 people. The brigadiers were often criminals who abused their positions. There were no ovens to bake bread, so the deportees ate the flour mixed with river water, which led to dysentery. Some deportees made primitive rafts to try to escape, but most of the rafts collapsed and hundreds of corpses washed up on the shore below the island. Guards hunted and killed other escapees, as if they were hunting animals for sport. Because of the lack of any transportation to the rest of the country except upstream to Tomsk, and the harshness of life in the taiga, any other escapees who made it across the river and evaded the guards were ultimately presumed dead. \n\nShortly after the deportees had already arrived on Nazino Island, the Yagoda and Berman plan was rejected by Stalin.\n\nSociety on the island quickly broke down and devolved into chaos: the majority of the population were city dwellers, most of whom knew nothing about basic agricultural practices such as clearing and cultivation that would make the island properly habitable. The sparsity of resources led to gangs forming, who began using violence to dominate the island. People were frequently murdered in fights over food and money, and the bodies of those in possession of anything of value such as gold tooth fillings and crowns were often looted. The guards established their own reign of terror, extorting settlers and executing people for minor offences despite being apathetic towards the gangs. The guards were also assigned to keep the settlers in, and killed people who attempted to escape. Even the doctors sent to monitor the island's population, who were supposed to have protection, began to fear for their lives. The lack of proper food and the frequency of death by late May led to cannibalism becoming widespread, to the point that settlers eventually began murdering individuals for the sole purpose of consuming them. On May 21, the three health officers counted 70 new deaths, with signs of cannibalism observed in five cases. Over the next month, guards arrested about 50 people for cannibalism. \n\nThe dire situation on Nazino Island was finally ended by Soviet authorities in early June, when the settlement was dissolved and the surviving 2,856 deportees were transferred to smaller settlements upstream the Nazina River, leaving just 157 deportees who could not be moved from the island for health reasons. Despite the settlement being disestablished, several hundred more of the deportees died during the transfer. People who survived the transfer found themselves with few tools, little food, and there was an outbreak of typhus. Most deportees refused to work in the new settlements due to their previous treatment.\n\nIn a period of thirteen weeks, of the roughly 6,000 deportee settlers intended for Nazino Island, between 1,500 to 2,000 had died due to starvation, exposure, disease, murder, or accidental death. Another 2,000 settlers had disappeared and their whereabouts untraceable, so they were presumed dead. The death tolls include people who either died or disappeared during their transportation to or from the island.\n\nIn early July, new settlements were constructed by the authorities using non-deportee labor, but only 250 Nazino Island settlers were transferred to these. Instead 4,200 new deportees who arrived from Tomsk were housed in these settlements. A report on the events which was sent to Stalin by Velichko was distributed by Lazar Kaganovich to members of the Politburo, and was preserved in an archive in Novosibirsk. It stated that 6,114 \"outdated elements\" (also known as \"déclassé and socially harmful elements\" or classless people) arrived on the island in May 1933, and at least 27 people died during the river transport. There was no shelter on the island, it snowed the first night, and no food was distributed for four days. On the first day 295 people were buried. Velichko’s letter to Stalin on August 20 claimed only 2,200 people survived out of about 6,700 deportees that he calculated had arrived from Tomsk. Velichko’s letter resulted in a commission by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to study the affair. In October, the commission estimated that of the roughly 2,000 survivors from Nazino Island, half were ill and bedridden, and that only about 200 to 300 were physically capable of working. There were attempts by local officials and guards at the island to dispute Velichko's report but were instead reprimanded, receiving prison sentences ranging between 12 months to 3 years. \n\nThe events that occurred at Nazino Island highlighted issues with Soviet colonization projects, and the Soviet leadership began to doubt their quality and efficiency. In 1933 alone, there were 367,457 known untraceable \"special resettlers\", of which 151,601 were dismissed and 215,856 simply disappeared from their settlements. Nazino Island directly led to the end of large scale settlement plans in the Soviet Union, and to the end of using deportees from \"urban déclassé elements\" and criminal backgrounds for future settlement plans.\n\nAfter the initial investigations in late 1933, the events at Nazino Island were largely forgotten as they were not made public, and only a small number of survivors, government officials, and eyewitnesses knew of their occurrence.\n\nIn 1988, at the time of the \"glasnost\" policy in the Soviet Union, details of the Nazino affair first became available to the general public through the efforts of the human rights group Memorial.\nIn 1989, an eyewitness reported to Memorial:\n\nThe French historian Nicolas Werth, who earlier co-authored \"The Black Book of Communism\", published the book \"Cannibal Island\" about the affair in 2006. It was translated into English in 2007. In 2009 a documentary \"L'île aux Cannibales\" (\"Cannibal Island\") was made, based on the book.\n\nNazino Island, now located in Alexandrovsky District of Tomsk Oblast, Russia, is also called \"Death Island\" (, \"\") or \"Cannibal Island\" due to the events there.\n\n\n"}

Soumya Sekhar Sahu, a 26 year old software engineer, and his great aunt, Jemamani Sahu, were killed by a parcel bomb delivered to Soumya's house a few days after his wedding. Soumya's wife, Reema, was seriously injured. After months of investigation, police arrested a colleague of Soumya's mother whom she had replaced at the college where she taught. Actor Hara Rath and director Sridhar Martha are planning a film based on the event.\n\nOn 23 February 2018, five days after the wedding of Soumya Sekhar Sahu and Reema Sahu, an explosion occurred at their home in Patnagarh, Odisha, India as Soumya opened a just-delivered parcel. The parcel had a return address of a person unknown to either of them, S. K. Sharma of Raipur, away. Soumya reportedly remarked, \"This looks like a wedding gift. The only thing that I don't know is the sender. I don't know anyone in Raipur\". The resulting explosion tore the plaster off the ceiling, cracked the walls, and hurled the kitchen window into a nearby field. Soumya and his great aunt Jemamani, who was visiting the couple at the time, suffered 90% TBSA burns and died en route to hospital. Reema was taken to hospital with serious injuries.\n\nNeither of the couple had known enemies. Soumya Sekhar's parents were college teachers. Soumya worked for a Japanese electronics firm in Bangalore. \n\nPolice still did not have a suspect a month after the fatal bombing. Pressured by press coverage, including a video of Soumya's wife wailing upon learning of her husband's death, the police turned the case over to an elite police branch in the state capital. One suspect was cleared after police traced a threatening call to a former boyfriend of Soumya's wife who believed he was dumped for a richer man; after he underwent a voluntary polygraph test, he was dismissed as a suspect. Police investigators traced the package to a courier company, but it had no office video surveillance of the package's customer.\n\nIn April 2018, Balangir police received an anonymous letter which blamed the parcel bombing on Soumya's \"betrayal\" and a loss of money, possibly as a result of a property dispute. The letter clarified that the sender was an S. K. Sinha, not R. K. Sharma, and also mentioned the involvement of \"three men\". Police investigators spent more than a month pursuing leads in four different cities. Finally, Soumya's mother studied the letter and recalled that her colleague often used the phrase \"completing the project\", which was similar to the phrase in the letter of \"undertaking the project\".\n\nPunji Lal Meher, an English teacher and formerly the principal of the Jyoti Vikas College in Balangir district who was replaced by Soumya's mother, was arrested after having been questioned earlier and dismissed as a suspect. Upon being questioned again after the receipt of the letter by the police, Meher said that he had been approached and threatened if he didn't mail a letter. The police investigator did not believe the explanation, remarking, \"It was the most incredible story that we've heard from a suspect\". Police sent computer hardware belonging to the suspect to an Israeli company for analysis and recovery of deleted data.\n\nMeher was accused of traveling to Raipur without his mobile phone or buying a train ticket and posting the parcel, returning the same day.\n\nThe suspect is thought to have had a desire \"to be noticed\" as an explanation of the bombing. He was taken to Raipur to be confronted by witnesses.\n\nThe parcel bombing was widely reported in India and other countries. The BBC characterized it as having \"riveted India\". A film, titled \"Bullet Raja\", is planned starring Odia actor Hara Rath and directed by Sridhar Martha.\n"}

{"id": "88577", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=88577", "title": "Reagan Doctrine", "text": "Reagan Doctrine\n\nThe Reagan Doctrine was a strategy orchestrated and implemented by the United States under the Reagan Administration to overwhelm the global influence of the Soviet Union in an attempt to end the Cold War. The doctrine was the centerpiece of United States foreign policy from the early 1980s until the end of the Cold War in 1991.\n\nUnder the Reagan Doctrine, the United States provided overt and covert aid to anti-communist guerrillas and resistance movements in an effort to \"roll back\" Soviet-backed communist governments in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. The doctrine was designed to diminish Soviet influence in these regions as part of the administration's overall strategy to end the Cold War.\n\nThe Reagan Doctrine followed in the tradition of U.S. presidents developing foreign policy \"doctrines\", which were designed to reflect challenges facing international relations, and to propose foreign policy solutions. The practice began with the Monroe Doctrine in 1823, and continued with the Roosevelt Corollary, sometimes called the Roosevelt Doctrine, introduced by Theodore Roosevelt in 1904.\n\nThe current post–World War II tradition of Presidential doctrines started with the Truman Doctrine in 1947, under which the US provided support to the governments of Greece and Turkey as part of a Cold War strategy to keep both nations out of the Soviet sphere of influence. It was followed by the Eisenhower Doctrine, the Kennedy Doctrine, the Johnson Doctrine, the Nixon Doctrine, and the Carter Doctrine, all of which defined the foreign policy approaches of these respective U.S. presidents on some of the largest global challenges of their presidencies.\n\nAt least one component of the Reagan Doctrine technically pre-dated the Reagan Presidency. In Afghanistan, the Carter administration began providing limited covert military assistance to Afghanistan's mujahideen in an effort to drive the Soviets out of the nation, or at least raise the military and political cost of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. The policy of aiding the mujahideen in their war against the Soviet occupation was originally proposed by Carter's national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski and was implemented by U.S. intelligence services. It enjoyed broad bipartisan political support.\n\nDemocratic congressman Charlie Wilson became obsessed with the Afghan cause, and was able to leverage his position on the House Appropriations committees to encourage other Democratic congressmen to vote for CIA Afghan war money, with the tacit approval of Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill (D-MA), even as the Democratic party lambasted Reagan for the CIA's secret war in Central America. It was a complex web of relationships described in George Crile III's book \"\".\n\nWilson teamed with CIA manager Gust Avrakotos and formed a team of a few dozen insiders who greatly enhanced the support for the Mujahideen, funneling it through Zia ul-Haq's ISI. Avrakotos and Wilson charmed leaders from various anti-Soviet countries including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and China to increase support for the rebels. Avrakotos hired Michael G. Vickers, a young Paramilitary Officer, to enhance the guerilla's odds by revamping the tactics, weapons, logistics, and training used by the Mujahideen. Michael Pillsbury, a Pentagon official, and Vincent Cannistraro pushed the CIA to supply the Stinger missile to the rebels. President Reagan's Covert Action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\n\nWith the arrival of the Reagan administration, The Heritage Foundation and other conservative foreign policy think tanks saw a political opportunity to significantly expand Carter's Afghanistan policy into a more global \"doctrine\", including U.S. support to anti-communist resistance movements in Soviet-allied nations in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. According to political analysts Thomas Bodenheimer and Robert Gould, \"it was the Heritage Foundation that translated theory into concrete policy. Heritage targeted nine nations for rollback: Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Iran, Laos, Libya, Nicaragua, and Vietnam\".\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the Heritage Foundation's foreign policy expert on the Third World, Michael Johns, the foundation's principal Reagan Doctrine advocate, visited with resistance movements in Angola, Cambodia, Nicaragua, and other Soviet-supported nations and urged the Reagan administration to initiate or expand military and political support to them. Heritage Foundation foreign policy experts also endorsed the Reagan Doctrine in two of their \"Mandate for Leadership\" books, which provided comprehensive policy advice to Reagan administration officials.\n\nThe result was that, unlike in Afghanistan, the Reagan Doctrine was rather quickly applied in Angola and Nicaragua, with the United States providing military support to the UNITA movement in Angola and the \"contras\" in Nicaragua, but without a declaration of war against either country. Addressing the Heritage Foundation in October 1989, UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi called the Heritage Foundation's efforts \"a source of great support. No Angolan will forget your efforts. You have come to Jamba, and you have taken our message to Congress and the Administration\". U.S. aid to UNITA began to flow overtly after Congress repealed the Clark Amendment, a long-standing legislative prohibition on military aid to UNITA.\n\nFollowing these victories, Johns and the Heritage Foundation urged further expanding the Reagan Doctrine to Ethiopia, where they argued that the Ethiopian famine was a product of the military and agricultural policies of Ethiopia's Soviet-supported Mengistu Haile Mariam government. Johns and Heritage also argued that Mengistu's decision to permit a Soviet naval and air presence on the Red Sea ports of Eritrea represented a strategic challenge to U.S. security interests in the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation and the Reagan administration also sought to apply the Reagan Doctrine in Cambodia. The largest resistance movement fighting Cambodia's communist government was largely made up of members of the former Khmer Rouge regime, whose human rights record was among the worst of the 20th century. Therefore, Reagan authorized the provision of aid to a smaller Cambodian resistance movement, a coalition called the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, known as the KPNLF and then run by Son Sann; in an effort to force an end to the Vietnamese occupation.\n\nWhile the Reagan Doctrine enjoyed strong support from the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute, the libertarian-oriented Cato Institute opposed the Reagan Doctrine, arguing in 1986 that \"most Third World struggles take place in arenas and involve issues far removed from legitimate American security needs. U.S. involvement in such conflicts expands the republic's already overextended commitments without achieving any significant prospective gains. Instead of draining Soviet military and financial resources, we end up dissipating our own.\"\n\nEven Cato, however, conceded that the Reagan Doctrine had \"fired the enthusiasm of the conservative movement in the United States as no foreign policy issue has done in decades\". While opposing the Reagan Doctrine as an official governmental policy, Cato instead urged Congress to remove the legal barriers prohibiting private organizations and citizens from supporting these resistance movements.\n\nWithin the Reagan administration, the doctrine was quickly embraced by nearly all of Reagan's top national security and foreign policy officials, including Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, and a series of Reagan National Security advisers including John Poindexter, Frank Carlucci, and Colin Powell.\n\nReagan himself was a vocal proponent of the policy. Seeking to expand Congressional support for the doctrine in the 1985 State of the Union Address in February 1985, Reagan said: \"We must not break faith with those who are risking their lives...on every continent, from Afghanistan to Nicaragua...to defy Soviet aggression and secure rights which have been ours from birth. Support for freedom fighters is self-defense\".\n\nAs part of his effort to gain Congressional support for the Nicaraguan contras, Reagan labeled the contras \"the moral equivalent of our founding fathers\", which was controversial because the contras had shown a disregard for human rights. There also were allegations that some members of the contra leadership were involved in cocaine trafficking.\n\nReagan and other conservative advocates of the Reagan Doctrine advocates also argued that the doctrine served U.S. foreign policy and strategic objectives and was a moral imperative against the former Soviet Union, which Reagan, his advisers, and supporters labeled an \"evil empire\".\n\nOther early conservative advocates for the Reagan Doctrine included influential conservative activist Grover Norquist, who ultimately became a registered UNITA lobbyist and an economic adviser to Savimbi's UNITA movement in Angola, and former Reagan speechwriter and current U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, who made several secret visits with the mujahideen in Afghanistan and returned with glowing reports of their bravery against the Soviet occupation. Rohrabacher was led to Afghanistan by his contact with the mujahideen, Jack Wheeler.\n\nIn 1985, as U.S. support was flowing to the Mujahideen, Savimbi's UNITA, and the Nicaraguan contras, columnist Charles Krauthammer, in an essay for \"Time\" magazine, labeled the policy the \"Reagan Doctrine,\" and the name stuck.\n\nKrauthammer has said of his writing in support of the Reagan Doctrine, \n\nThe Reagan Doctrine was especially significant because it represented a substantial shift in the post–World War II foreign policy of the United States. Prior to the Reagan Doctrine, U.S. foreign policy in the Cold War was rooted in \"containment\", as originally defined by George F. Kennan, John Foster Dulles, and other post–World War II U.S. foreign policy experts. In January 1977, four years prior to becoming president, Reagan bluntly stated, in a conversation with Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. \"My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is simple, and some would say simplistic,\" he said. \"It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?\"\n\nAlthough a similar policy of \"rollback\" had been considered on a few occasions during the Cold War, the U.S. government, fearing an escalation of the Cold War and possible nuclear conflict, chose not to confront the Soviet Union directly. With the Reagan Doctrine, those fears were set aside and the United States began to openly confront Soviet-supported governments through support of rebel movements in the doctrine's targeted countries.\n\nOne perceived benefit of the Reagan Doctrine was the relatively low cost of supporting guerrilla forces compared to the Soviet Union's expenses in propping up client states. Another benefit was the lack of direct involvement of American troops, which allowed the United States to confront Soviet allies without sustaining casualties. Especially since the September 11 attacks, some Reagan Doctrine critics have argued that, by facilitating the transfer of large amounts of weapons to various areas of the world and by training military leaders in these regions, the Reagan Doctrine actually contributed to \"blowback\" by strengthening some political and military movements that ultimately developed hostility toward the United States, such as al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. However, no direct U.S. aid to Osama bin Laden or any of his affiliates has ever been established.\n\nHistorian Greg Grandin described a disjuncture between official ideals preached by the United States and actual U.S. support for terrorism. \"Nicaragua, where the United States backed not a counter insurgent state but anti-communist mercenaries, likewise represented a disjuncture between the idealism used to justify U.S. policy and its support for political terrorism. ... The corollary to the idealism embraced by the Republicans in the realm of diplomatic public policy debate was thus political terror. In the dirtiest of Latin America's dirty wars, their faith in America's mission justified atrocities in the name of liberty\". Grandin examined the behaviour of the U.S.-backed contras and found evidence that it was particularly inhumane and vicious: \"In Nicaragua, the U.S.-backed Contras decapitated, castrated, and otherwise mutilated civilians and foreign aid workers. Some earned a reputation for using spoons to gouge their victims' eyes out. In one raid, Contras cut the breasts of a civilian defender to pieces and ripped the flesh off the bones of another.\"\n\nProfessor Frederick H. Gareau has written that the Contras \"attacked bridges, electric generators, but also state-owned agricultural cooperatives, rural health clinics, villages, and non-combatants\". U.S. agents were directly involved in the fighting. \"CIA commandos launched a series of sabotage raids on Nicaraguan port facilities. They mined the country's major ports and set fire to its largest oil storage facilities.\" In 1984 the U.S. Congress ordered this intervention to be stopped; however, it was later shown that the Reagan administration illegally continued (See Iran–Contra affair). Gareau has characterized these acts as \"wholesale terrorism\" by the United States.\n\nA CIA manual for training the Nicaraguan Contras in psychological operations, leaked to the media in 1984, entitled \"Psychological Operations in Guerrilla War\". recommended \"selective use of violence for propagandistic effects\" and to \"neutralize\" government officials. Nicaraguan Contras were taught to lead:\n\nSimilarly, former diplomat Clara Nieto, in her book \"Masters of War\", charged that \"the CIA launched a series of terrorist actions from the \"mothership\" off Nicaragua's coast. In September 1983, she charged the agency attacked Puerto Sandino with rockets. The following month, frogmen blew up the underwater oil pipeline in the same port – the only one in the country. In October there was an attack on Puerto Corinto, Nicaragua's largest port, with mortars, rockets, and grenades blowing up five large oil and gasoline storage tanks. More than a hundred people were wounded, and the fierce fire, which could not be brought under control for two days, forced the evacuation of 23,000 people.\"\n\nThe International Court of Justice, when judging the case of \"Nicaragua v. United States\" in 1984, found that the United states was obligated to pay reparations to Nicaragua, because it had violated international law by actively supporting the Contras in their rebellion and by mining the Naval waters of Nicaragua. The United States refused to participate in the proceedings after the Court rejected its argument that the ICJ lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. The U.S. later blocked the enforcement of the judgment by exercising its veto power in the United Nations Security Council and so prevented Nicaragua from obtaining any actual compensation.\n\nAs the Reagan administration set about implementing The Heritage Foundation plan in Afghanistan, Angola, and Nicaragua, it first attempted to do so covertly, not as part of official policy. \"The Reagan government's initial implementation of the Heritage plan was done covertly\", according to the book \"Rollback\", \"following the longstanding custom that containment can be overt but rollback should be covert\". Ultimately, however, the administration supported the policy more openly.\n\nWhile the doctrine benefited from strong support from the Reagan administration, The Heritage Foundation and several influential Members of Congress, many votes on critical funding for resistance movements, especially the Nicaraguan contras, were extremely close, making the Reagan Doctrine one of the more contentious American political issues of the 1980s.\n\nAs arms flowed to the contras, Savimbi's UNITA and the mujahideen, the Reagan Doctrine's advocates argued that the doctrine was yielding constructive results for U.S. interests and global democracy.\n\nIn Nicaragua, pressure from the Contras led the Sandinstas to end the State of Emergency, and they subsequently lost the 1990 elections. In Afghanistan, the mujahideen bled the Soviet Union's military and paved the way for Soviet military defeat. In Angola, Savimbi's resistance ultimately led to a decision by the Soviet Union and Cuba to bring their troops and military advisors home from Angola as part of a negotiated settlement.\n\nAll of these developments were Reagan Doctrine victories, the doctrine's advocates argue, laying the ground for the ultimate dissolution of the Soviet Union. Michael Johns later argued that \"the Reagan-led effort to support freedom fighters resisting Soviet oppression led successfully to the first major military defeat of the Soviet Union...Sending the Red Army packing from Afghanistan proved one of the single most important contributing factors in one of history's most profoundly positive and important developments\".\n\nAmong others, Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990, has credited the Reagan Doctrine with aiding the end of the Cold War. In December 1997, Thatcher said that the Reagan Doctrine \"proclaimed that the truce with communism was over. The West would henceforth regard no area of the world as destined to forego its liberty simply because the Soviets claimed it to be within their sphere of influence. We would fight a battle of ideas against communism, and we would give material support to those who fought to recover their nations from tyranny\".\n\nU.S. funding for the Contras, who opposed the Sandinista government of Nicaragua, was obtained from covert sources. The U.S. Congress did not authorize sufficient funds for the Contras' efforts, and the Boland Amendment barred further funding. In 1986, in an episode that became known as The Iran–Contra affair, the Reagan administration illegally facilitated the sale of arms to Iran, the subject of an arms embargo, in the hope that the arms sales would secure the release of hostages and allow U.S. intelligence agencies to fund the Nicaraguan Contras.\n\nIn February 2002, UNITA's Jonas Savimbi was killed by Angolan military forces in an ambush in eastern Angola. Savimbi was succeeded by a series of UNITA leaders, but the movement was so closely associated with Savimbi that it never recovered the political and military clout it held at the height of its influence in the late 1980s.\n\nThe Reagan Doctrine continued into the administration of Reagan's successor, George H. W. Bush, who won the U.S. presidency in November 1988. Bush's Presidency featured the final years of the Cold War and the Gulf War, but the Reagan Doctrine soon faded from U.S. policy as the Cold War ended. Bush also noted a presumed peace dividend to the end of the Cold War with economic benefits of a decrease in defense spending. However, following the presidency of Bill Clinton, a change in United States foreign policy was introduced with the presidency of his son George W. Bush and the new Bush Doctrine, who increased military spending in response to the September 11th attacks.\n\nIn Nicaragua, the Contra War ended after the Sandinista government, facing military and political pressure, agreed to new elections, in which the contras' political wing participated, in 1990. In Angola, an agreement in 1989 met Savimbi's demand for the removal of Soviet, Cuban and other military troops and advisers from Angola. Also in 1989, in relation to Afghanistan, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev labeled the war against the U.S.-supported mujahideen a \"bleeding wound\" and ended the Soviet occupation of the country.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "520006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=520006", "title": "Sinterklaas", "text": "Sinterklaas\n\nSinterklaas () or \"Sint-Nicolaas\" () is a legendary figure based on Saint Nicholas, patron saint of children. Other names for the figure include \"De Sint\" (\"The Saint\"), \"De Goede Sint\" (\"The Good Saint\"), and \"De Goedheiligman\" (\"The Good Holy Man\") in Dutch; \"Saint Nicolas\" in French; \"Sinteklaas\" in West Frisian; \"Sinterklaos\" in Limburgs; \"Saint-Nikloi\" in West Flemish; and \"Kleeschen\" and \"Zinniklos\" in Luxembourgish.\n\nThe feast of \"Sinterklaas\" celebrates the name day of Saint Nicholas on 6 December. The feast is celebrated annually with the giving of gifts on St. Nicholas' Eve (5 December) in the Netherlands and on the morning of 6 December, Saint Nicholas Day, in Belgium, Luxembourg and northern France (French Flanders, Lorraine and Artois). The tradition is also celebrated in territories of the former Dutch Empire, including Curaçao and Suriname.\n\nSinterklaas is the primary source of the popular Christmas icon of Santa Claus.\n\n\"Sinterklaas\" is based on the historical figure of Saint Nicholas (270–343), a Greek bishop of Myra in present-day Turkey. He is depicted as an elderly, stately and serious man with white hair and a long, full beard. He wears a long red cape or chasuble over a traditional white bishop's alb and sometimes red stola, dons a red mitre and ruby ring, and holds a gold-coloured crosier, a long ceremonial shepherd's staff with a fancy curled top.\nHe traditionally rides a white horse. In the Netherlands, the horse is called \"Amerigo\", and in Belgium, it is named \"Slecht Weer Vandaag\", meaning \"Bad Weather Today\".\nSinterklaas carries a big, red book in which is written whether each child has been good or naughty in the past year.\n\nSinterklaas is assisted by many \"Zwarte Piet\" (\"Black Pete\"); helpers with black faces in colourful Moorish dress. Zwarte Piet first appeared in print as the nameless servant of Saint Nicholas in \"Sint-Nikolaas en zijn knecht\" (\"St. Nicholas and His Servant/Apprentice\"), published in 1850 by Amsterdam schoolteacher Jan Schenkman; however, the tradition appears to date back at least as far as the early 19th Century.\n\nZwarte Piet's colourful dress is based on 16th-century noble attire, with a ruff (lace collar) and a feathered cap. He is typically depicted carrying a bag which contains candy for the children, which they toss around, a tradition supposedly originating in the story of Saint Nicholas saving three young girls from prostitution by tossing golden coins through their window at night to pay their dowries.\n\nTraditionally, he would also carry a birch rod (Dutch: \"roe\"), a chimney sweep's broom made of willow branches, used to spank children who had been naughty. Some of the older Sinterklaas songs make mention of naughty children being put in Zwarte Piet's bag and being taken back to Spain. This part of the legend refers to the times that the Moors raided the European coasts, and as far as Iceland, to abduct the local people into slavery. This quality can be found in other companions of Saint Nicholas such as Krampus and Père Fouettard. In modern versions of the Sinterklaas feast, however, Zwarte Piet no longer carries the \"roe\" and children are no longer told that they will be taken back to Spain in Zwarte Piet's bag if they have been naughty.\n\nOver the years many stories have been added, and Zwarte Piet has developed from a rather unintelligent helper into a valuable assistant to the absent-minded saint. In modern adaptations for television, Sinterklaas has developed a Zwarte Piet for every function, such as a head Piet (\"Hoofdpiet\"), a navigation Piet (\"Wegwijspiet\") to navigate the steamboat from Spain to the Netherlands, a gift-wrapping Piet (\"Pakjespiet\") to wrap all the gifts, and an acrobatic Piet to climb roofs and chimneys.\n\nTraditionally Zwarte Piet's face is said to be black because he is a Moor from Spain. Today, some prefer to say that his face is blackened with soot because he has to climb through chimneys to deliver gifts for Sinterklaas.\n\nThe figure of Zwarte Piet is considered by some to be racist. Accordingly, the traditions surrounding the holiday of Sinterklaas have been the subject of numerous editorials, debates, documentaries, protests and even violent clashes at festivals. Some large cities and television channels now only display Zwarte Piet characters with some soot marks on the face rather than full blackface, so-called \"roetveegpieten\" or \"schoorsteenpieten\" (\"chimney Petes\"). Nevertheless, both Zwarte Piet and the holiday remain popular in the Netherlands.\n\nIn a 2013 survey, 92% of the Dutch public did not perceive Zwarte Piet as racist or associate him with slavery, and 91% were opposed to altering the character's appearance. In a similar survey in 2018, 88% of the Dutch public did not perceive Zwarte Piet as racist, and 54% were happy with the character's modernized appearance (a mix of \"roetveegpieten\" and blackface).\n\nThe festivities traditionally begin each year in mid-November (the first Saturday after 11 November), when Sinterklaas \"arrives\" by a steamboat at a designated seaside town, supposedly from Spain. In the Netherlands this takes place in a different port each year, whereas in Belgium it always takes place in the city of Antwerp. The steamboat anchors, then Sinterklaas disembarks and parades through the streets on his horse, welcomed by children cheering and singing traditional Sinterklaas songs. His \"Zwarte Piet\" assistants throw candy and small, round, gingerbread-like cookies, either \"kruidnoten\" or \"pepernoten\", into the crowd. The event is broadcast live on national television in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nFollowing this national arrival, every other town celebrates its own \"intocht van Sinterklaas\" (arrival of Sinterklaas). Local arrivals usually take place later on the same Saturday of the national arrival, the next Sunday (the day after he arrives in the Netherlands or Belgium), or one weekend after the national arrival. In places a boat cannot reach, Sinterklaas arrives by train, horse, horse-drawn carriage or even a fire truck.\n\nSinterklaas is said to come from Spain, possibly because in 1087, half of Saint Nicholas' relics were transported to the Italian city of Bari, which later formed part of the Spanish Kingdom of Naples. Others suggest that mandarin oranges, traditionally gifts associated with St. Nicholas, led to the misconception that he must have been from Spain. This theory is backed by a Dutch poem documented in 1810 in New York and provided with an English translation:\n<poem>Sinterklaas, goedheiligman!\nTrek uwe beste tabberd an,\nReis daar mee naar Amsterdam,\nVan Amsterdam naar Spanje,\nDaar Appelen van Oranje,\nDaar Appelen van granaten,\nDie rollen door de straten.\n</poem>\n<poem>Saint Nicholas, good holy man!\nPut on the Tabard, best you can,\nGo, therewith, to Amsterdam,\nFrom Amsterdam to Spain,\nWhere apples bright of Orange,\nAnd likewise those granate surnam'd,\nRoll through the streets, all free unclaim'd [...]\n</poem>\nThe text presented here comes from a pamphlet that John Pintard released in New York in 1810. It is the earliest source mentioning Spain in connection to \"Sinterklaas\". Pintard wanted St. Nicholas to become patron saint of New York and hoped to establish a \"Sinterklaas\" tradition. Apparently he got help from the Dutch community in New York, that provided him with the original Dutch \"Sinterklaas\" poem. Strictly speaking, the poem does not state that Sinterklaas \"comes\" from Spain, but that he needs to \"go\" to Spain to pick up the oranges and pomegranates. So the link between Sinterklaas and Spain goes through the oranges, a much appreciated treat in the 19th century. Later the connection with the oranges got lost, and Spain became his home.\n\nIn the weeks between his arrival and 5 December, Sinterklaas also visits schools, hospitals and shopping centers. He is said to ride his white-grey horse over the rooftops at night, delivering gifts through the chimney to the well-behaved children. Traditionally, naughty children risked being caught by Black Pete, who carried a jute bag and willow cane for that purpose.\n\nBefore going to bed, children put their shoes next to the fireplace chimney of the coal-fired stove or fireplace (or in modern times close to the central heating radiator). They leave the shoe with a carrot or some hay in it and a bowl of water nearby \"for Sinterklaas' horse\", and the children sing a Sinterklaas song. The next day they find some candy or a small present in their shoes.\n\nTypical Sinterklaas treats traditionally include mandarin oranges, \"pepernoten\", \"speculaas\" (sometimes filled with almond paste), banketletter (pastry filled with almond paste) or a chocolate letter (the first letter of the child's name made out of chocolate), chocolate coins, \"suikerbeest\" (animal-shaped figures made of sugary confection), and \"marzipan\" figures. Newer treats include gingerbread biscuits or and a figurine of Sinterklaas made of chocolate and wrapped in colored aluminum foil.\n\nIn the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas' Eve, 5 December, became the chief occasion for gift-giving during the winter holiday season. The evening is called \"Sinterklaasavond\" (\"Sinterklaas evening\") or \"Pakjesavond\" (\"gifts evening\", or literally \"packages evening\").\n\nOn the evening of 5 December, parents, family, friends or acquaintences pretend to act on behalf of \"Sinterklaas\", or his helpers, and fool the children into thinking that \"Sinterklaas\" has really given them presents. This may be done through a note that is \"found\", explaining where the presents are hidden, as though Zwarte Piet visited them and left a burlap sack of presents with them. Sometimes a neighbor will knock on the door (pretending to be a Zwarte Piet) and leave the sack outside for the children to retrieve; this varies per family. When the presents arrive, the living room is decked out with them, much as on Christmas Day in English-speaking countries. On 6 December \"Sinterklaas\" departs without any ado, and all festivities are over.\n\nIn the Southern Netherlands and Belgium, most children have to wait until the morning of 6 December to receive their gifts, and Sinterklaas is seen as a festivity almost exclusively for children. The shoes are filled with a poem or wish list for Sinterklaas and carrots, hay or sugar cubes for the horse on the evening of the fifth and in Belgium often a bottle of beer for Zwarte Piet and a cup of coffee for Sinterklaas are placed next to them. Also in some areas, when it is time for children to give up their pacifier, they place it into his or her shoe (\"safekeeping by Sinterklaas\") and it is replaced with chocolate the next morning.\n\nThe present is often creatively disguised by being packaged in a humorous, unusual or personalised way. This is called a \"surprise\" (from the French ).\n\nPoems from Sinterklaas usually accompany gifts, bearing a personal message for the receiver. It is usually a humorous poem which often teases the recipient for well-known bad habits or other character deficiencies.\n\nIn recent years, influenced by North-American media and the Anglosaxian Christmas tradition, when the children reach the age where they get told \"the big secret of Sinterklaas\", some people will shift to Christmas Eve or Christmas Day for the present giving. Older children in Dutch families where the children are too old to believe in Sinterklaas anymore, also often celebrate Christmas with presents instead of \"pakjesavond\". Instead of such gifts being brought by Sinterklaas, family members ordinarily draw names for an event comparable to Secret Santa. Because of the popularity of his \"older cousin\" Sinterklaas, Santa Claus is however not commonly seen in the Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nHélène Adeline Guerber and others have drawn parallels between \"Sinterklaas\" and his helpers and the Wild Hunt of Wodan or Odin, a major god among the Germanic peoples, who was worshipped in Northern and Western Europe prior to Christianization. Riding the white horse Sleipnir he flew through the air as the leader of the Wild Hunt, always accompanied by two black ravens, Huginn and Muninn. Those helpers would listen, just like Zwarte Piet, at the chimney – which was just a hole in the roof at that time – to tell Wodan about the good and bad behaviour of the mortals. Due to its speculative character, however, this older \"Germanic\" theory has little support among present-day scholars, although it continues to be popular in non-scholarly sources. At the same time, it seems clear that the Saint Nicholas tradition contains a number of elements that are not ecclesiastical in origin.\n\nSince some elements of the \"Sinterklaas\" celebration are unrelated to Christianity, there are theories regarding the pagan origins of various customs of the holiday stemming from areas where the Germanic peoples were Christianized and retained elements of their indigenous traditions, surviving in various forms into modern depictions of \"Sinterklaas\". Non-Christian elements in \"Sinterklaas\" that arguably could have been of pagan origin:\n\nThe \"Sinterklaasfeest\" arose during the Middle Ages. The feast was both an occasion to help the poor, by putting money in their shoes (which evolved into putting presents in children's shoes) and a wild feast, similar to Carnival, that often led to costumes, a \"topsy-turvy\" overturning of daily roles, and mass public drunkenness.\n\nIn early traditions, students elected one of their classmates as \"bishop\" on St. Nicholas Day, who would rule until 28 December (Innocents Day), and they sometimes acted out events from the bishop's life. As the festival moved to city streets, it became more lively.\n\nDuring the Reformation in 16th- and 17th-century Europe, Protestant reformers like Martin Luther changed the Saint gift bringer to the Christ Child or \"Christkindl\" and moved the date for giving presents from 6 December to Christmas Eve. Certain protestant municipalities and clerics forbade Saint Nicholas festivities, as the Protestants wanted to abolish the cult of saints and saint adoration, while keeping the midwinter gift-bringing feast alive.\n\nAfter the successful revolt of the largely Protestant northern provinces of the Low Countries against the rule of Roman Catholic king Philip II of Spain, the new Calvinist regents, ministers and clericals prohibited celebration of Saint Nicholas. The newly independent Dutch Republic officially became a Protestant country and abolished public Catholic celebrations. Nevertheless, the Saint Nicholas feast never completely disappeared in the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, where the public Saint Nicholas festivities were very popular, main events like street markets and fairs were kept alive with persons impersonating Nicholas dressed in red clothes instead of a bishop's tabard and miter. The Dutch government eventually tolerated private family celebrations of Saint Nicholas' Day, as can be seen on Jan Steen's painting \"The Feast of Saint Nicholas\".\n\nIn the 19th century, the saint emerged from hiding and the feast became more secularized at the same time. The modern tradition of \"Sinterklaas\" as a children's feast was likely confirmed with the illustrated children's book \"Sint-Nicolaas en zijn knecht\" ('Saint Nicholas and his servant'), written in 1850 by the teacher Jan Schenkman (1806–1863). Some say he introduced the images of Sinterklaas' delivering presents by the chimney, riding over the roofs of houses on a grey horse, and arriving from Spain by steamboat, which at that time was an exciting modern invention. Perhaps building on the fact that Saint Nicholas historically is the patron saint of the sailors (many churches dedicated to him have been built near harbors), Schenkman could have been inspired by the Spanish customs and ideas about the saint when he portrayed him arriving via the water in his book. Schenkman introduced the song \"Zie ginds komt de stoomboot\" (\"Look over yonder, the steamboat is arriving\"), which is still popular in the Netherlands.\n\nIn Schenkman's version, the medieval figures of the mock devil, which later changed to Oriental or Moorish helpers, was portrayed for the first time as black African and called \"Zwarte Piet\" (Black Peter).\n\nDuring the German occupation of the Netherlands (1940–1945) many of the traditional \"Sinterklaas\" rhymes were rewritten to reflect current events. The Royal Air Force (RAF) was often celebrated. In 1941, for instance, the RAF dropped boxes of candy over the occupied Netherlands. One classical poem turned contemporary was the following:\n\n<poem>\n\"Sinterklaas, kapoentje,\"\n\"Gooi wat in mijn schoentje,\"\n\"Gooi wat in mijn laarsje,\"\n\"Dank U Sinterklaasje\"\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\n\"R.A.F. Kapoentje,\"\n\"Gooi wat in mijn schoentje,\"\n\"Bij de Moffen gooien,\"\n\"Maar in Holland strooien!\"\n</poem>\n<poem>\nSinterklaas, little capon,\nThrow something in my little shoe,\nThrow something in my little boot,\nThank you dear Sinterklaas\n</poem>\n\n<poem>\nR.A.F. little Capon,\nthrow something in my little shoe\nthrow [bombs] at the Krauts\nbut scatter [candy] in Holland!\n</poem>\n\nThis is a variation of one of the best-known traditional Sinterklaas rhymes, with \"RAF\" replacing \"Sinterklaas\" in the first line (the two expressions have the same metrical characteristics in the first and second, and in the third and fourth lines). The Dutch word \"kapoentje\" (little rascal) is traditional to the rhyme, but in this case it also alludes to a capon. The second line is straight from the original rhyme, but in the third and fourth line the RAF is encouraged to drop bombs on the \"Moffen\" (slur for Germans, like \"krauts\" in English) and candy over the Netherlands. Many of the \"Sinterklaas\" poems of this time noted the lack of food and basic necessities, and the German occupiers having taken everything of value; others expressed admiration for the Dutch Resistance.\n\nOriginally \"Sinterklaas\" was only accompanied with one (or sometimes two) \"Zwarte Pieten\", but just after the liberation of the Netherlands, Canadian soldiers organized a Sinterklaas party with many Zwarte Pieten, and ever since this has been the custom, each Piet normally having his own dedicated task.\n\nIn Curaçao, Dutch-style Sinterklaas events are organized to this day. The Zwarte Piet characters have their faces painted all the colours of the rainbow. Prime Minister Ivar Asjes has spoken negatively of the tradition. In 2011, the government of Gerrit Schotte threatened to withdraw the grant for the Dutch tradition after the Curaçaoan activist Quinsy Gario was arrested, when he protested in Dordrecht against the use of Zwarte Piet.\n\nDutch-style Sinterklaas events are also organized in Suriname to this day. In 2011, opposition member of parliament and former president Ronald Venetiaan called for an official ban on Sinterklaas because he considers Zwarte Piet to be a racist element.\n\nIn 1970 the Surinamese playwright Eugène Drenthe envisioned the character of \"Gudu Ppa\" (\"Father of Riches\" in Sranantongo) as a postcolonial replacement of Sinterklaas. Instead of a white man, Gudu Ppa was black. His helpers symbolized Suriname's different ethnic groups, replacing Zwarte Piet. 5 December was officially renamed \"Kinderdag\" (\"Children's Day\") in Suriname. Although promoted by the military regime in the eighties, Gudu Ppa never really caught on.\n\n\"Sinterklaas\" is the basis for the North American figure of Santa Claus. It is often claimed that during the American War of Independence, the inhabitants of New York City, a former Dutch colonial town (New Amsterdam), reinvented their \"Sinterklaas\" tradition, as Saint Nicholas was a symbol of the city's non-English past. In the 1770s the \"New York Gazetteer\" noted that the feast day of \"St. a Claus\" was celebrated \"by the descendants of the ancient Dutch families, with their usual festivities.\" In a study of the \"children's books, periodicals and journals\" of New Amsterdam, the scholar Charles Jones did not find references to Saint Nicholas or Sinterklaas. Not all scholars agree with Jones' findings, which he reiterated in a book in 1978. Howard G. Hageman, of New Brunswick Theological Seminary, maintains that the tradition of celebrating Sinterklaas in New York existed in the early settlement of the Hudson Valley. He agrees that \"there can be no question that by the time the revival of St. Nicholas came with Washington Irving, the traditional New Netherlands observance had completely disappeared.\" However, Irving's stories prominently featured legends of the early Dutch settlers, so while the traditional practice may have died out, Irving's St. Nicholas may have been a revival of that dormant Dutch strand of folklore. In his 1812 revisions to \"A History of New York\", Irving inserted a dream sequence featuring St. Nicholas soaring over treetops in a flying wagon a creation others would later dress up as Santa Claus.\n\nBut was Irving the first to revive the Dutch folklore of Sinterklaas? In New York, two years earlier John Pintard published a pamphlet with illustrations of Alexander Anderson in which he calls for making Saint Nicholas the patron Saint of New York and starting a Sinterklaas tradition. He was apparently assisted by the Dutch because in his pamphlet he included an old Dutch Sinterklaas poem with an English translation. In the Dutch poem, Saint Nicholas is referred to as 'Sancta Claus'. Ultimately, his initiative helped \"Sinterklaas\" to pop up as Santa Claus in the Christmas celebration, which returned freed of episcopal dignity and ties via England and later Germany to Europe again.\n\nThe Saint Nicholas Society of New York celebrates a feast on 6 December to this day. The town of Rhinebeck in Dutchess County, New York, which was founded by Dutch and German immigrants, has an annual Sinterklaas celebration. It includes Sinterklaas' crossing the Hudson River and then a parade to the center of town.\n\nDuring the Reformation in 16th–17th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer from Sinterklaas to the Christ Child or \"Christkindl\" (corrupted in English to Kris Kringle). Similarly, the date of giving gifts changed from 5 or 6 December to Christmas Eve.\n\nIn a scene in \"Miracle on 34th Street\", a Dutch girl recognises Kris Kringle as Sinterklaas. They converse in Dutch and sing a Sinterklaas song while she sits on his lap, to the amazement of Susan Walker, who is then convinced that he is the real Santa Claus.\n\nSinterklaas has been the subject of a number of Dutch novels, films and television series, primarily aimed at children. Sinterklaas-themed children's films include \"Winky's Horse\" (2005) and the sequel \"Where Is Winky's Horse?\" (2007).\n\nSinterklaas-themed films aimed at adults include the drama \"Makkers Staakt uw Wild Geraas\" (1960), which won a Silver Bear award at the 11th Berlin International Film Festival; the romantic comedy \"Alles is Liefde\" (2007) and its Belgian remake \"Zot van A.\" (2010); and the Dick Maas-directed horror film \"Sint\" (2010).\n\n\"De Club van Sinterklaas\" is a Sinterklaas-themed soap opera aimed at children. The popular television series has run since 1999 and has had a number of spin-off series. Since 2001, a Sinterklaas \"news\" program aimed at children is broadcast daily on Dutch television during the holiday season, the \"Sinterklaasjournaal\". The Dutch-Belgian Nickelodeon series \"Slot Marsepeinstein\" has aired since 2009.\n\nMuch of the first half of \"A War of Gifts\" by Orson Scott Card is about the Sinterklaas tradition, including chapter 4 \"Sinterklaas Eve\" and 5 \"Sinterklaas Day\".\n\nIn the fourth episode of the television series \"The Librarians\" (\"And Santa's Midnight Ride\"), Santa (Bruce Campbell) is an \"immortal avatar\" who has existed in many different incarnations throughout history. After experiencing mistletoe poisoning, he briefly turns into Sinterklaas, using his magic to make toys appear in people's shoes, before regaining control of his current incarnation.\n\nSinterklaas also appeared in \"Sesamstraat\", the Dutch version of \"Sesame Street\".\n\nOther holiday figures based on Saint Nicholas are celebrated in some parts of Germany and Austria (\"Sankt Nikolaus\"); Hungary (\"Mikulás\"); Switzerland (\"Samichlaus\"); Italy (\"San Nicola\" in Bari, South Tyrol, Alpine municipalities, and many others); parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Serbia (\"Sveti Nikola\"); Slovenia (\"Sveti Nikolaj\" or \"Sveti Miklavž\"); Greece (\"Hagios Nikolaos\"); Romania (\"Moș Nicolae\"); Albania (\"Shën Kolli\", \"Nikolli\"), among others.

The race includes two events, a 50 km (31 mile) and 20 km (12.5 mile) course. Both events begin and end on the Chena River in downtown Fairbanks. Both events are freestyle, mass start and are raced simultaneously.\n\nThe race was founded in 1988 by noted Fairbanks skier Bob Baker. The name of the race is based on a Koyukon word which translates roughly as 'sliding around in early spring' and was used by Native people to describe the motion of cross-country skiers.\n\nBoth the 20 km and 50 km events begin and end on the Chena River above the Cushman Street bridge in downtown Fairbanks. The course then proceeds up the Chena River, entering Fort Wainwright army post and continuing as far as the Birch Hill Ski & Snowboard Area. At that point the 20 km race turns around and returns via the same course back to the start/finish area.\n\nThe 50 km course proceeds up the Birch Hill alpine ski hill to connect with the trails system at the Birch Hill Recreation Area. From there the course follows all of the trails in the Birch Hill system (excepting the classic-only trails) in a counter-clockwise direction. After approximately 27 km the course again returns to the top of the alpine ski hill and proceeds back to the river and to the start/finish area by the same route. \n\nIn 2012 the 50 km race will make use of a new trail constructed to gain access to the Birch Hill Recreation Area. Rather than climbing directly up the alpine ski hill, the Sonot Connector trail climbs through the forest to the east of the ski hill, starting from the top of the rope tow and making two long switchbacks. \n\nAdjustments to the course are sometimes made due to weather or snow conditions. When it is not possible to hold the race on river, either due to ice conditions or cold temperatures, the race may be held entirely on the trail system at the Birch Hill Recreation Area, beginning and ending in the stadium area. In these cases the race is usually shortened to compensate for the addition of steeper terrain. In years of low snowfall when it is not possible to easily connect between the river and the alpine ski area, the race may be held entirely on the river. In this the 20 km course remains unchanged, but the 50 km course proceeds slightly further up the river before turning around at 12.5 km, returning to the start, and then doing another lap of the same course along the river.\n\n"}

It discusses online harassment as a threat to the useful functions of the internet, and argues for new approaches to managing the issue. The book was reissued in 2018 with a new preface by Jeong.\n\nIn 2015, \"Forbes\" published \"The Internet of Garbage\" in 2015 as part of their \"\"Forbes\" Signature Series\" of e-books. In 2018, \"The Verge\" reissued a \"1.5\" version of the book with a new preface by Jeong after she joined the editorial board of \"The New York Times\".\n\nThe thesis of the book is that most of the internet has always been garbage, which has always threatened to make the internet useless. Spam is one such form of garbage, and it has been addressed, imperfectly but manageably, through the use of technology and human curation. Online harassment, especially of women and people of color, has become the newest kind of garbage, and new ways of thinking, new law, and new technologies are needed to manage it.\n\nWritten after the concentrated harassment campaigns perpetrated against Caroline Criado Perez in 2013 and multiple other women in the Gamergate controversy in 2014, the book deals with issues of online harassment, and especially gender- and race-related harassment, with an emphasis on the physical danger caused by doxing. The book describes how harassment makes the internet smaller, and less free for its targets, and seeks to broaden the frontier of free speech for all internet users. Other subjects covered include the effects of online visibility on social reputation, and spam. \n\nWriting from a legal and policy perspective, Jeong describes how the regulations applied to the internet, such as the DMCA and the Communications Decency Act, have been based in copyright law and are focused on taking down problematic content after it has been posted, and were designed to protect corporate interests. She describes how this has made user-generated social media much more viable than it could otherwise have been, but on the other hand, it has left platforms without a framework or legal motivation to address hate speech, harassment, and propaganda. The books suggests other approaches to dealing with harassment, more akin to the way that spam is filtered.\n\n\"The Internet of Garbage\" was favorably received in the technology press and by feminist organizations. Writing for Techdirt, Mike Masnick reviewed the book as \"nuanced and well worth reading\". Author and professor Alan Jacobs called it \"very well done, and rather sobering\". \"Fortune\" called the 2018 reissue \"more valuable than ever\".\n\n\n"}

Ships with toxic and radioactive waste were sunk off the Italian coast. In addition, vessels were allegedly sent to Somalia and other developing countries with toxic waste, including radioactive waste cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. The introduction of more rigorous environmental legislation in the 1980s made illegal waste dumping a lucrative business for organized crime groups in Italy.\n\nA 1995 parliamentary waste commission report spoke of the \"possible existence of national and international trafficking in radioactive waste, managed by business and criminal lobbies, which are believed to operate also with the approval of institutional subjects belonging to countries and governments of the European Union and outside the EU.\" Its conclusions noted \"interferences and threats\" against investigators, and were critical of ENEA, Italy's state energy research agency, and their management of nuclear waste.\n\nThe 'Ndrangheta, an Italian mafia-type syndicate, has been accused by pentito Francesco Fonti, a former member of 'Ndrangheta, of sinking at least 30 ships loaded with toxic waste, much of it radioactive. In 2005, Fonti revealed the conspiracy in the news magazine \"L'espresso\". His statements led to widespread investigations into the radioactive waste disposal rackets, involving Giorgio Comerio and his disposal company, the Odm (Oceanic Disposal Management).\n\nLegambiente, an Italian NGO for the protection of the environment, provided the public prosecutor’s office with all the data collected by Legambiente since 1994 concerning the disappearance of at least 40 ships in Mediterranean waters. Over two decades, Italian prosecutors have looked into more than 30 suspicious deep-water sinkings. They suspect that Italian and foreign industrialists have acted in league with the 'Ndrangheta, and possibly government agencies, to use the Mediterranean as a dumping ground. Vessels that sank in fair weather had suspicious cargo, sent no mayday or the crew vanished.\n\nAccording to Fonti, a manager of ENEA paid the clan to get rid of 600 drums of toxic and radioactive waste from Italy, Switzerland, France, Germany, and the US, with Somalia as the destination, where the waste was buried after buying off local politicians. Former employees of ENEA are suspected of paying the criminals to take waste off their hands in the 1980s and 1990s. Shipments to Somalia continued into the 1990s, while the 'Ndrangheta clan also blew up shiploads of waste, including radioactive hospital waste, and sending them to the sea bed off the Calabrian coast.\n\nFonti personally sank three ships and identified a wreck located 28 kilometres off the coast of Cetraro, in Calabria, by environmental workers as MV \"Cunsky\" and says he sank it himself in 1992, complete with 120 barrels of toxic and radioactive waste. He said 'Ndrangheta received £100,000 for the job. Fonti had been put on the job by his boss Sebastiano Romeo of the 'Ndrangheta clan from San Luca in collaboration with Giuseppe Giorgi. Another 'Ndrangheta boss involved was Natale Iamonte who sank ships near Melito di Porto Salvo.\n\nHowever, the vessel they surveyed off Cetraro in deep waters off the coast of Calabria turned out to be a passenger steamship sunk by a German submarine in 1917. Consequently, one of the prosecutors questioned the reliability of Fonti on the alleged sinkings, although his collaboration with the authorities since 1994 had resulted in high-profile arrests of 'Ndrangheta members involved in drug trafficking.\n\nBoth Fonti and environmental group Legambiente claimed vessels were sent to Somalia and other developing countries such as Kenya and Zaire with toxic cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. Legambiente alleges that local rebel groups were given weapons in exchange for receiving the waste ships. Fonti claims that Italian TV journalist Ilaria Alpi and her cameraman Miran Hrovatin were murdered in 1994 in Somalia because they had seen toxic waste arrive in Bosaso, Somalia.\n\nAccording to Fonti, Christian Democrat politicians, including former prime minister Ciriaco De Mita, had been involved in illegal disposal operations, using the secret service SISMI to cover up their connection. De Mita denied the allegations. Fonti also claimed that Socialist politicians Gianni De Michelis and Bettino Craxi intervened to ensure that Italian peacekeeping troops in Somalia turned a blind eye to the transports.\n\nThe huge waves which battered northern Somalia after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami were initially believed to have stirred up illegally dumped toxic and nuclear waste. There are also heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and mercury. The waves broke up rusting barrels and other containers and hazardous waste dumped along the long, remote shoreline in the war-racked country during the early 1990s, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).\n\nHowever, a United Nations technical fact-finding mission in 2005 did not find any traces of toxic waste along the shorelines after the tsunami. In 2006, the Somali NGO Daryeel Bulsho Guud, with access to the different warring clans, conducted a survey and identified 15 containers of \"confirmed nuclear and chemical wastes\" in eight coastal areas. A source with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) described the search for hazardous material in Somalia as \"like looking for a needle in a haystack. It’s not that they don’t know it’s there ... but that they don’t know where to start looking for it.\"\n"}

Forty-five Ukrainian intellectuals, theologians, writers, and a librarian were accused of \"anti-state\" activities (or counter-revolutionary activities for some). Fifteen of the defendants worked in the organization of the All-Ukrainian Academy of Science. About thirty of them were members of former Ukrainian political parties. One was a former prime-minister while two others were ministers of the Ukrainian People's Republic. Finally, six were members of the Central Rada. Amongst those 45 defendants, two were of Jewish background and three were female. \n\nAccording to the Museum of Soviet Occupation, this proceeding became a sort of political slogan to persecute Ukraine's older and foremost academical intelligentsia, as well as representatives of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC). According to one of the defendants, the Senior attorney of the secret department of Kiev okrug department of GPU Solomon Bruk was repeating during the interrogations: \"We must put the Ukrainian intelligentsia on its knees, it is our duty and it will be executed; those whom we would not be able [to subdue], we're going to shoot!\" Soon after that, 700 other people were arrested in connection with the process. The total number is not known, but up to 30 thousand people are estimated to have been arrested, exiled, and/or executed during and after the trial.\n\nAccording to Soviet sources, the SVU was an underground organization which supposedly existed in Ukraine from June 1926 to July 1929, when it was exposed by the State Political Directorate. The SVU allegedly existed in the Ukrainian diaspora (it should not be confused with the Union of Liberation of Ukraine, which operated during World War II abroad). \n\nAccording to the indictment, the SVU put the task of liberation of the Ukrainian people in all ethnographic Ukrainian territory and the establishment of an independent Ukrainian Republic, which had to be parliamentary and democratic, with a broad right of citizens to private property. The indictment alleges that the SVU was preparing popular uprisings, in close agreement with leaders of Ukrainian diaspora. In addition, the Union of Ukrainian Youth (SUM) was to organize terrorist acts against the Soviet Union, and Soviet Ukrainian leaders.\n\nAmong others in the dock were:\n\n\nThe Chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Court who heard the case was Anton Prykhodko, the chief prosecutor M. Mykhailyk (Attorney-General of the Republic and Deputy Narkom). Among the public prosecutors were Panas Lyubchenko, academician A. Sokolovsky, writer O. Slisarenko. \n\nOn the side of the defendants were Ratner, Vilensky, Puhtynsky. \n\nAmong the defendants were three females: Liudmyla Starytska-Chernyakhivska, Liudmyla Bidnova, A. Tokarivska; two doctors - members UNAS, 15 professors of higher schools, two students, a director of a middle school, 10 teachers, a theologian and a priest of UAOC, three writers, five editors, two cooperators, two lawyers and a librarian; 15 defendants were employees of UNAS. Many defendants were united through political activities during the struggle for freedom (1917–1920): 31 of them were once members of the Ukrainian political parties (15 - UPSF, 12 - USDRP, 4 - UPSR), one was a prime minister, two - Ministers of the Ukrainian government, six - members of the Ukrainian Central Rada. According to the indictment act, 33 of the accused belonged to the Kiev group of SVU, three represented Dnipropetrovsk and Odessa, two - Poltava and Mykolaiv, and a single representation was from Chernihiv and Vinnytsia. Among the defendants were two Ukrainians of Jewish ethnicity: a historian Yosyp Germaize and a lawyer Morhulis.\n\nThe process had numerous inconsistencies. Leaders of the Ukrainian emigration strongly denied prosecutors' allegations that the emigration gave instructions to SVU. In particular, L. Chykalenko denied that he ever sent a letter of instruction to Yefremov. The existence of such a letter was also denied by J. Hermayze. N. Pavlushkova (sister of the defendant) argues that \"SVU as an organization was the centre for a very narrow circle of people, not more than 12 - 15, without a strong organized periphery\" and it recognized that the confessions at the trial of the defendants was forced.\n\nDespite the Soviet SVU publicity process, the sentence was considered too moderate. According to K. Turkalo, one of the defendants, the prosecutor threatened 13 of the defendants with the Highest Degree of Penalty (death penalty), but did not demand it. 45 defendants were sentenced to 10 years ofimprisonment in strict isolation, 6 to 8 years, 3 to 6 years, 10 to 5 years, 21 to 3 years and 1 to 2 years, 10 received a suspended sentence and were immediately released. 5 more were pardoned in a few months. Some prisoners had been sent to the Solovetsky Islands. In the 1930s and during the first months of World War II, many participants of the SVU were again arrested and disappeared. Most of the accused died in prison or in exile, only a few emigrated (K. Turkalo), and some were rehabilitated after World War II (V. Hantsov, V. Atamanovskyy).\n\nIn modern Ukrainian opinion, the dominant thought is that SVU and SUM did not exist as organizations, and were provocations of the GPU (V. Holubnychyy, V. Hryshko, M. Kowalewsky, G. Kostyuk, Yu. Lavrinenko, R. Sallivant, K. Turkalo, P. Fedak), however some sources recognize the existence of SVU (N. Pavlushkova, W. Ivy). \n\nThe hypothesis that SVU - SUM was a fictitious organization of the GPU is supported by the existence of other show trials (Shakhty process in 1928 or the so-called Prompartia (Industrial Party) in December 1930), which were purely political. \n\nIt is more probable that the defendants in the SVU process were Ukrainian patriots, who actively worked for the Ukrainian national cultural renaissance in the 1920s, but they did so spontaneously, without creating any anti-Soviet political organization, with no directive from the Ukrainian emigration.\n\n\n\n"}

The resolution demanded Iran cease the attacks on the commercial ships to and from the ports of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.\n\nResolution 552 concluded by stating that if the present resolution was not implemented, it would meet again to discuss further action it could take on the matter. It also requested the Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar to report on the progress of the implementation of Resolution 552.\n\nThe resolution was adopted by 13 votes to none, with two abstentions from Nicaragua and Zimbabwe.\n\nThough Resolution 552 condemned Iran for attacks on ships, Iraq had also attacked an unspecified number beforehand, which led to claims of one-sidedness by Iran. On the days following the adoption of this resolution, two Saudi Arabian F-15s shot down two Iranian F-4 Phantoms over Saudi Arabian airspace. \n\n\n"}
