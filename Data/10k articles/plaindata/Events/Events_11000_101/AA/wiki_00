{"id": "2885124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2885124", "title": "Agonalia", "text": "Agonalia\n\nAn Agonalia or Agonia was an obscure archaic religious observance celebrated in ancient Rome several times a year, in honor of various divinities. Its institution, like that of other religious rites and ceremonies, was attributed to Numa Pompilius, the semi-legendary second king of Rome. Ancient calendars indicate that it was celebrated regularly on January 9, May 21, and December 11.\n\nA festival called Agonia or Agonium Martiale, in honor of Mars, was celebrated March 17, the same day as the Liberalia, during a prolonged \"war festival\" that marked the beginning of the season for military campaigning and agriculture.\n\nThe object of this festival was a disputed point among the ancients themselves, but as J.A. Hartung observed, the offering was a ram \"(aries)\", the usual victim sacrificed to the guardian gods of the state; the presiding priest was the \"rex sacrificulus\", and the site was the Regia, both of which could be employed only for ceremonies connected with the highest gods that affected the wellbeing of the whole state.\n\nThe etymology of the name was also a subject of much dispute among the ancients. The various etymologies proposed are given at length by Ovid. None of these, however, is satisfactory. One possibility is that the sacrifice in its earliest form was offered on the Quirinal Hill, which was originally called \"Agonus\", at the Colline gate, \"Agonensis\". The sacrifice is explicitly located at the Regia, or the \"domus regis\" (\"house of the king\"), which in the historical period was at the top of the Via Sacra, near the arch of Titus, though one ancient source states that in earliest times, the Regia was on the Quirinal.\n\nThe Circus Agonensis, as it is called, is supposed by some to have occupied the place of the present Piazza Navona, and to have been built by the emperor Alexander Severus on the spot where the victims were sacrificed at the Agonalia. It may not, however, have been a circus at all, and Humphrey omits the site in his work on Roman circuses.\n\nAn \"Agonium\" occurs on January 9 in the \"Fasti Praenestini\", albeit in mutilated form. In Ovid's poem on the Roman calendar, he calls it once the \"dies agonalis\" (\"agonal day\") and elsewhere the Agonalia, and offers a number of etymologies of varied plausibility. Festus explains the word \"agonia\" as an archaic Latin term for \"hostia\", a sacrificial victim. Augustine of Hippo thought the Romans had a god named Agonius, who might then have been the god of the Colline part of the city (see \"Etymology\" above).\n\nThis third occurrence of the Agonia or Agonalia shares the date of December 11 with the Septimontium or \"Septimontiale sacrum\", which only very late Roman calendars take note of and which depends on a textual conjecture. The relation between the two observances, if any exists, is unknown. A fragmentary inscription found at Ostia that reads: \"Agonind\" testifies that this festival was dedicated to Sol Indiges. It was indeed the second festival celebrating this deity, after that of August 10.\n\nThe Agonia to Mars occurs during a period of festivals in March (Latin \"Martius\"), the namesake month of Mars. These were the chariot races of the Equirria February 27, a \"feria\" on the Kalends of March (a day sacred also to his mother Juno), a second Equirria on March 14, his Agonalia March 17, and the Tubilustrium March 23.\n\nA note on the holiday from Varro indicates that this Agonia was of more recondite significance than the Liberalia held on the same day. Varro's source is the books of the Salian priests surnamed \"Agonenses\", who call it the Agonia instead. According to Masurius Sabinus, the Liberalia was called the \"Agonium Martiale\" by the pontiffs. Modern scholars are inclined to think that the sharing of the date was a coincidence, and that the two festivals were unrelated.\n\n"}

The games usually took place in August or September. The games were held annually between 2002 and 2013, with the exception of 2006. After a five-year hiatus, mass games returned under the rubric The Glorious Country in 2018.\n\nAccording to the Russian News Agency \"TASS\", \"Arirang is a gymnastics and artistic festival, known as mass games. The extravaganza unfolds an epic story of how the Arirang nation of Korea, a country of morning calm, in the Orient put an end to the history of distress and rose as a dignified nation with the song 'Arirang'. The Arirang performance has been included in the Guinness Book of Records.\"\n\nThe name refers to \"Arirang\", a Korean folk story about a young couple who are torn apart by an evil landlord, here intended to represent the division of Korea.\n\nThe festival was held annually between 2002 and 2013, with the exception of 2006. The mass games were not held in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. In recent years, foreign tourists have been allowed to watch one of the many performances.\n\nThe mass games returned after a five-year hiatus, taking place from 9 September through 30 September 2018. The new installment is called The Glorious Country ().\n\nThe Mass Games possess an important ideological character praising the Workers' Party of Korea, its armed forces, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. These messages may not be clear to foreign spectators, who are not aware of North Korean iconography: a rising sun symbolizes Kim Il-sung. When a gun is shown, it signifies the gun which Kim Il-sung gave to his son Kim Jong-il. The colour red, particularly in flowers, stands for the working class, and the colour purple and red flowers represent Kim Il-sung (as the flower Kimilsungia is a purple orchid and the flower Kimjongilia is a red begonia). A snowy mountain with a lake represents Mount Paektu, where Kim Jong-il is said to have been born in a log cabin.\n\nFrom as young as five years old, citizens are selected based on skill level to serve for the Arirang Festival for many years. In most cases this will be the way of life for them until retirement. They are students of 8 schools of Pyongyang, each of them has its own colour.

Like most Rush songs, the music was written by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, and the lyrics by Neil Peart. The song uses the storming of the Bastille, which began the French Revolution, as an allegory for revolutionary fervor needed in the struggle against tyrannical government. It is therefore in the same vein as other libertarian-themed songs from the early stages of Rush's career, including \"Anthem\", \"Closer to the Heart\", \"Freewill\", \"Something for Nothing\", and \"A Farewell to Kings\", when the band — Neil Peart and Geddy Lee in particular — was influenced by the Objectivist philosopher Ayn Rand.\n\nLive versions of the song appear on the albums \"All the World's a Stage\" and \"Different Stages\".

{"id": "152534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=152534", "title": "Book burning", "text": "Book burning\n\nBook burning is the ritual destruction by fire of books or other written materials, usually carried out in a public context. The burning of books represents an element of censorship and usually proceeds from a cultural, religious, or political opposition to the materials in question.\n\nIn some cases, the destroyed works are irreplaceable and their burning constitutes a severe loss to cultural heritage. Examples include the burning of books and burying of scholars under China's Qin Dynasty (213–210 BCE), the burning of the Library of Alexandria (c. 49), the obliteration of the Library of Baghdad (1258), the destruction of Aztec codices by Itzcoatl (1430s), and the burning of Maya codices on the order of bishop Diego de Landa (1562).\n\nIn other cases, such as the Nazi book burnings, other copies of the destroyed books survive, but the instance of book burning becomes emblematic of a harsh and oppressive regime which is seeking to censor or silence an aspect of a nation's culture.\n\nBook burning can be an act of contempt for the book's contents or author, and the act is intended to draw wider public attention to this opinion. Examples include the burning of Wilhelm Reich's books by the FDA and the 2010 Qur'an-burning controversy.\n\nArt destruction is related to book burning, both because it might have similar cultural, religious, or political connotations, and because in various historical cases books and artworks were destroyed at the same time.\n\nIn modern times, other forms of media, such as phonograph records, video tapes, and CDs have also been burned, shredded, or crushed.\n\nWhen the burning is widespread and systematic, destruction of books and media can become a significant component of cultural genocide. \n\nThe burning of books has a long history as a tool wielded by authorities both secular and religious, in efforts to suppress dissenting or heretical views that are perceived as posing a threat to the prevailing order.\n\nAccording to the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible), in the 7th century BCE King Jehoiakim of Judah burned part of a scroll Baruch ben Neriah had written at prophet Jeremiah's dictation (Jeremiah 36).\n\nQin Shi Huang, first emperor of Qin Dynasty, ordered a Burning of books and burying of scholars in 213 BC and burial alive of 460 Confucian scholars in 210 BC in order to stay in the throne. Some of these books were written in Shang Xiang, a superior school founded in 2208 BC. The event caused the loss of many philosophical treatises of the Hundred Schools of Thought. The official philosophy of government (\"legalism\") survived.\n\nIn Acts in the New Testament Paul performed an exorcism in Ephesus. After men in Ephesus failed to perform the same feat many gave up their \"curious arts\" and burned the books because apparently they didn't work.\nAnd many that believed, came and confessed and shewed their deeds. Many of them also which used curious arts, brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.\nAfter the First Council of Nicea (325 AD), Roman emperor Constantine the Great issued an edict against nontrinitarian Arians which included a prescription for systematic book-burning: \"In addition, if any writing composed by Arius should be found, it should be handed over to the flames, so that not only will the wickedness of his teaching be obliterated, but nothing will be left even to remind anyone of him. And I hereby make a public order, that if someone should be discovered to have hidden a writing composed by Arius, and not to have immediately brought it forward and destroyed it by fire, his penalty shall be death. As soon as he is discovered in this offense, he shall be submitted for capital punishment...\" According to Elaine Pagels, \"In AD 367, Athanasius, the zealous bishop of Alexandria... issued an Easter letter in which he demanded that Egyptian monks destroy all such unacceptable writings, except for those he specifically listed as 'acceptable' even 'canonical'—a list that constitutes the present 'New Testament'\". (Pagels cites Athanasius's Paschal letter (letter 39) for 367 AD, which prescribes a canon but does not explicitly order monks to destroy excluded works.) Heretical texts do not turn up as palimpsests, scraped clean and overwritten, as do many texts of Classical antiquity. According to author Rebecca Knuth, multitudes of early Christian texts have been as thoroughly \"destroyed\" as if they had been publicly burnt.\n\nThe stories surrounding the loss of the great Library of Alexandria include:\n\n\n\"Much of its downfall was gradual, often bureaucratic, and by comparison to our cultural imaginings, somewhat petty.\" (Compare: El-Abbadi, M. (1990). The Life and Fate of the Ancient Library of Alexandria. Mayenne, France: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, for tales of survival of the collection, in part, into the era of the Caliphate.)\n\nActivity by Cyril of Alexandria ( 376–444) brought fire to almost all the writings of Nestorius (386-450) shortly after 435. 'The writings of Nestorius were originally very numerous', however, they were not part of the Nestorian or Oriental theological curriculum until the mid-sixth century, unlike those of his teacher Theodore of Mopsuestia, and those of Diodorus of Tarsus, even then they were not key texts, so relatively few survive intact, cf. Baum, Wilhelm and Dietmar W. Winkler. 2003. The Church of the East: A Concise History. London: Routledge.\n\nAccording to the Chronicle of Fredegar, Recared, King of the Visigoths (reigned 586–601) and first Catholic king of Spain, following his conversion to Catholicism in 587, ordered that all Arian books should be collected and burned; and all the books of Arian theology were reduced to ashes, along with the house in which they had been purposely collected. Which facts demonstrate that Constantine's edict on Arian works was not rigorously observed, as Arian writings or the theology based on them survived to be burned much later in Spain.\n\nIn 1244, as an outcome of the Disputation of Paris, twenty-four carriage loads of Talmuds and other Jewish religious manuscripts were set on fire by French law officers in the streets of Paris.\n\nDuring the conquest of the Americas and in the aftermath of the encounter between European and indigenous American civilizations, many books written by indigenous peoples were destroyed. There were many books written by the Aztecs in existence at the time of the Spanish conquest of Yucatán in the 16th century. However, most were destroyed by the Conquistadors and the Catholic priests, with the exception of the work of the priest Bartolome de la Casas. In particular, many books in Yucatán were ordered destroyed by Bishop Diego de Landa in July 1562. De Landa wrote: \"We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they (the Maya) regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.\" Ironically, most of the books that were destroyed by the Europeans were biased and based upon the Aztec people's version of the history of the region. The Aztecs had previously conquered the area and destroyed many of the Mayan books and documents.\n\nThe schism between the Church of England and that of the Roman Catholic Church reached a tipping point during the Tudor and Stuart periods of England (1485-1603, 1603-1714), when the citizens loyal to Crown and Country sacked Abbeys and Monasteries across the British countryside, and pillaged their valuable books to burn, degrade, or destroy. David Cressy’s (2005) article, \"Book Burning in Tudor and Stuart England\" discussed the mechanics of these book burnings and how the enforcement was trickled down to the citizens; that everyone had a part in this “spectacle”. “Over the course of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries book burning developed from a rare to an occasional occurrence, relocated from an outdoor to an indoor procedure, and changed from a bureaucratic to a quasi-theatrical performance” \n\nThe Library of Congress was founded in 1800, 24 years after the United States gained its independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1814, 3,000 books from the Library of Congress were used by the British forces to burn down the US Capitol during the Burning of Washington. Although there were dissenting voices to this wanton destruction, the conflagration was motivated by a strong desire on the part of the British to humiliate the Americans.\n\nAnthony Comstock's New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, founded in 1873, inscribed book burning on its seal, as a worthy goal to be achieved. Comstock's total accomplishment in a long and influential career is estimated to have been the destruction of some 15 tons of books, 284,000 pounds of plates for printing such 'objectionable' books, and nearly 4,000,000 pictures. All of this material was defined as \"lewd\" by Comstock's very broad definition of the term—which he and his associates successfully lobbied the United States Congress to incorporate in the Comstock Law.\n\n\"Main: Nazi book burnings\"\n\nThe Nazi government decreed broad grounds for burning material:\n\nIn 1588, the exiled English Catholic William Cardinal Allen wrote \"An Admonition to the Nobility and People of England\", a work sharply attacking Queen Elizabeth I. It was to be published in Spanish-occupied England in the event of the Spanish Armada succeeding in its invasion. Upon the defeat of the Armada, Allen carefully consigned his publication to the fire, and it is only known of through one of Elizabeth's spies, who had stolen a copy.\n\nThe Hassidic Rabbi Nachman of Breslov is reported to have written a book which he himself burned in 1808. To this day, his followers mourn \"The Burned Book\" and seek in their Rabbi's surviving writings for clues as to what the lost volume contained and why it was destroyed.\n\nCarlo Goldoni is known to have burned his first play, a tragedy called \"Amalasunta\", when encountering unfavorable criticism.\n\nNikolai Gogol burned the second half of his magnum opus \"Dead Souls\", having come under the influence of a priest who persuaded him that his work was sinful; Gogol later described this as a mistake.\n\nIn the 1870s Tchaikovsky destroyed the manuscript full score of his first opera, \"The Voyevoda\". During the Soviet period \"The Voyevoda\" was posthumously reconstructed from surviving orchestral and vocal parts and the composer's sketches. \n\nAfter Hector Hugh Munro (better known by the pen name \"Saki\") was killed in World War I in November 1916, his sister Ethel destroyed most of his papers.\n\nJoe Shuster, who together with Jerry Siegel created the fictional superhero Superman, in 1938 burned the first Superman story when under the impression that it would not find a publisher.\n\nIn Catholic hagiography, Saint Vincent of Saragossa is mentioned as having been offered his life on condition that he consign Scripture to the fire; he refused and was martyred. He is often depicted holding the book which he protected with his life.\n\nAnother book-saving Catholic Saint is the Tenth Century St. Wiborada. She is credited with having predicted in 925 a Hungarian invasion of her region in Switzerland. Her warning allowed the priests and religious of St. Gall and St. Magnus to hide their books and wine and escape into caves in nearby hills. Wiborada herself refused to escape and was killed by the marauders, being later canonized. In art, she is commonly represented holding a book to signify the library she saved, and is considered a patron saint of libraries and librarians.\n\nAt the beginning of the Battle of Monte Cassino in the World War II, two German officers - Viennese-born Lt.Col. Julius Schlegel (a Roman Catholic), and Captain Maximilian Becker (a Protestant) - had the foresight to transfer the Monte Cassino archives to the Vatican. Otherwise the archives - containing a vast number of documents relating to the 1500-years' history of the Abbey as well as some 1,400 irreplaceable manuscript codices, chiefly patristic and historical - would have been destroyed in the Allied air bombing which almost completely destroyed the Abbey shortly afterwards. Also saved by the two officers' prompt action were the collections of the Keats-Shelley Memorial House in Rome which had been sent to the Abbey for safety in December 1942.\n\nThe Sarajevo Haggadah - one of the oldest and most valuable Jewish illustrated manuscripts, with immense historical and cultural value - was hidden from the Nazis and their Ustashe collaborators by Derviš Korkut, chief librarian of the National Museum in Sarajevo. At risk to his own life, Korkut smuggled the Haggadah out of Sarajevo and gave it for safekeeping to a Muslim cleric in Zenica, where it was hidden until the end of the war under the floorboards of either a mosque or a Muslim home. The Haggadah again survived destruction during the wars which followed the Breakup of Yugoslavia \nIn 1940's France, a group of anti-fascist exiles created a Library of Burned Books which housed all the books that Adolf Hitler had destroyed. This library contained copies of titles that were burned. These book burnings from the Nazis was an idea to help cleanse German culture of Jewish and foreign influences such as pacifist and decadent literature. The Nazis were going to make a \"museum\" of Judaism once the \"Final Solution\" was complete to house certain books that were saved by the Nazis themselves.\n\nWhen Virgil died, he left instructions that his manuscript of the \"Aeneid\" was to be burnt, as it was a draft version with uncorrected faults and not a final version for release. However, this instruction was ignored. It is mainly to the \"Aeneid\", published in this \"imperfect\" form, that Virgil owes his lasting fame – and it is considered one of the great masterpieces of classical literature as a whole.\n\nBefore his death, Franz Kafka wrote to his friend and literary executor Max Brod: \"Dearest Max, my last request: Everything I leave behind me... in the way of diaries, manuscripts, letters (my own and others'), sketches, and so on, [is] to be burned unread.\" Brod overrode Kafka's wishes, believing that Kafka had given these directions to him, specifically, because Kafka knew he would not honour them – Brod had told him as much. Had Brod carried out Kafka's instructions, virtually the whole of Kafka's work – except for a few short stories published in his lifetime – would have been lost forever. Most critics, at the time and up to the present, justify Brod's decision.\n\nA similar case concerns the noted American poet Emily Dickinson, who died in 1886 and left to her sister Lavinia the instruction of burning all her papers. Lavinia Dickinson did burn almost all of her sister's correspondences, but interpreted the will as not including the forty notebooks and loose sheets, all filled with almost 1800 poems; these Lavinia saved and began to publish the poems that year. Had Lavinia Dickinson been more strict in carrying out her sister's will, all but a small handful of Emily Dickinson's poetic work would have been lost.\n\nBiblioclasm still occurs. All over the world schools and libraries have been destroyed in recent years. Despite the act of destroying books being condemned by the majority of society, people still participate on small and/or large scale.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, when a modified Latin alphabet was adopted, books published in Arabic script were burned, especially in the late 1920s and 1930s. The texts were not limited to the Quran; medical and historical manuscripts were also destroyed.\n\nBook burnings were organised regularly in Nazi Germany in the 1930s by stormtroopers to destroy \"degenerate\" works, especially by Jewish authors such as Thomas Mann, Marcel Proust and Karl Marx.\n\nIn the 1950s, over six tons of books by William Reich were burned in the U.S. under judicial orders.\n\nIn Denmark, a comic book burning took place 23 June 1955. It was a bonfire consisting of comic books and on top of that a life size cardboard cutout of The Phantom.\n\nKjell Ludvik Kvavik, a senior Norwegian official, had a penchant for removing maps and other pages from rare books and was noticed in January 1983 by a young college student. The student, Barbro Andenaes, reported the actions of the senior official to the superintendent of the reading room and then to the head librarian of the university library in Oslo. Hesitant to make public something that would greatly hurt the career of Kvavik even if the accusation proved false, media kept the name of the perpetrator quiet until his house was searched by police. The authorities seized 470 maps and prints as well as 112 books that Kvavik had illegally obtained. While this may not be the large scale, violent demonstration seen during wars, Kvavik's disregard for libraries and books shows that destruction of books on any scale can affect an entire country. Here, a senior official in the Norwegian government was disgraced and the University Library was refunded only a small portion of the costs it incurred from the loss and destruction of rare materials as well as the security changes that had to be made. In this case, the draw of personal profit and enhancing one's own collection was the cause of the defacement of rare books and maps. While the main goal was not destruction for destruction's sake, the resulting damage to the ephemera still carries weight within the library community.\nIn 1984, Amsterdam's South African Institute was infiltrated by an organized group bent on drawing attention to the inequality of the apartheid. Well-organized and ensuring patrons of the library that no harm would come to them, group members systematically smashed microfiche machines and threw books into the nearby waterway. Indiscriminate of the content being destroyed, shelf after shelf was cleared of its contents until the group left. Staff members fished books from the water in hopes of salvaging the rare editions of travel books, documents about the Boer Wars, and contemporary materials both for and against apartheid. Many were destroyed by oil, ink, and paint that the anti-apartheid demonstrators had flung around the library. The world was outraged at the loss of knowledge that these demonstrators had caused, and instead of winning support and getting attention on the issue of apartheid, the international audience cried out against the actions at the Amsterdam's South African Institute. Some demonstrators came forward to explain that they believed the institute was pro-apartheid and that nothing was being done to change the status quo in South Africa.\n\nThe advent of the digital age has resulted in an immense collection of written work being catalogued exclusively or primarily in digital form. The intentional deletion or removal of these works has been often referred to as a new form of book burning.\n\nSome supporters have celebrated book burning cases in art and other media. Such is the bas-relief by Giovanni Battista Maini of \"The Burning of Heretical Books\" over a side door on the façade of Santa Maria Maggiore, Rome, which depicts the burning of 'heretical' books as a triumph of righteousness.\n\nIn 1973, during the years of the Chilean fascist dictatorship under Augusto Pinochet, hundreds of books were burned as a way of repression and censorship of leftist literature.\n\nA similar incident also occurred in Mullumbimby, New South Wales, Australia in 2009. Reported as \"just like the ritual burning of books in Nazi Germany\", a book-burning ceremony was held by students of the \"socially harmful cult\" Universal Medicine, an esoteric healing business owned by Serge Benhayon. Students were invited to throw their books onto the pyre. Most of the volumes were on Chinese medicine, kinesiology, acupuncture, homeopathy and other alternative healing modalities, all of which Benhayon has decreed evil or \"prana\".\n\nIn 1981, the Jaffna Public Library in Jaffna, Sri Lanka was burned down by Sinhalese police and paramilitaries during a pogrom against the minority Tamil population. At the time of its burning it contained almost 100,000 Tamil books and rare documents.\n\nIt is estimated that during 1990s in Croatia over 2,8 million books were destroyed by the Croatian government. Those were the books written in Cyrillic, written in Ekavian version of Serbo-Croatian, written by the Serbs or by \"unsuitable\" Croats. \n\nIn the Sikh religion, any copies of their sacred Guru, Guru Granth Sahib which are too badly damaged to be used, and any printer's waste which bears any of its text, are cremated. Such a cremation is called \"Agan Bhet\", and is similar to that performed when cremating a deceased Sikh.\n\nIn his 1821 play, \"Almansor\", the German writer Heinrich Heine—referring to the burning of the Muslim holy book, the Qur'an, during the Spanish Inquisition—wrote, \"Where they burn books, so too will they in the end burn human beings.\" (\"Dort, wo man Bücher verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am Ende Menschen.\") Over a century later, Heine's own books were among the thousands of volumes that were torched by the Nazis in Berlin's Opernplatz, even while his poem Die Lorelei continued to be printed in German schoolbooks as \"by an unknown author\". In Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, the book deals with the concept of censorship via burning books. It is said that Bradbury wrote the book due to his concerns of literature being burned in America during the McCarthy era and as well, fearing that mass media (television especially) reduce the interest in reading books.\n\nThe Japanese light novel series , by Hiro Arikawa, describes how an armed Library Defence Force protects libraries from censorship after a lethal attack at library. Which is later adapted to manga, 12-episode anime, internet radio shows, and finally live action films and special TV episode.\n\n\n\n"}

They wear a traditional outfit called the casera dress. For girls it consists of a long skirt and a long-sleeved old-fashioned shirt with headscarves and aprons. The boys wear a long black shirt, trousers and txapela (traditional black beret). The casera outfits are normally dark blue, but can come in many colors. They wear caseras because that is what the people of the mountain wear and the holiday used to celebrate the peasants who sold their goods in town and came on Santo Tomas to pay rent to landlords in the city.\n\nIn the Basque Country the equivalent of Santa is Olentzero, and Olentzero lives or lived (depending on what you believe) in the mountains, and he wears the boys' casera. He is a mythical Basque character who is widely portrayed as a messenger who cries out that it is Christmas time throughout all the corners of the Basque Country. In some versions, the Olentzero is a farmer or a shepherd. Nevertheless, it is common in all of the tales that the Olentzero brings good news to people.\n\nHe is also known as the coal man who comes down from the mountains on his pottok (wild Basque horse) to hand out presents to children. Chestnuts and wine are given to the villagers. By tradition, on December 24, the Basque television and radio stations broadcast that the Olentzero has begun his journey from the mountains to children's homes.\n\nIn Francoist Spain (1939 - 1975), Olentzero was banned as a symbol of regional separatism. It was only after the Spanish transition to democracy that the tradition was restored to the Basque Country.\n\nOn Christmas Day all the children in the Basque Country go to sleep early and they leave their shoes in the middle of whatever room in the house that isn't the bathroom or their bedroom. Olentzero leaves all the presents beside the shoes. On New Year's Day some people put on their casera dresses and they go sing to the retired people in the retirement home. The day after in the morning, whether it's raining or snowing, it's a tradition for some people to go swim in the sea (if there is a sea in their town or city). The one other day that is important to the Basques is the 6th of January (the Day of the Three Kings). On that night the same happens. The children leave their shoes out and in the night the Three Kings come and leave presents, but much less than Olentzero does.\n\n\n"}

First performed in 1852, the opera, apart from its overture, is now lost.\n\nRubinstein asked for a libretto from Sollogub, who had also worked on Glinka's successful opera \"A Life for the Tsar\", on what was ostensibly also a nationalist theme, the success of Dmitry Donskoy at the Battle of Kulikovo (1380) against the commander of the Tatar Golden Horde, Mamai. However he ignored the historic elements in favour of a fairly routine operatic love story.\n\nThe overture was completed first and was performed at a concert in 1850. But Rubinstein faced trouble with the Russian censors, who forbade any stage presentation of Donskoy himself singing. Eventually the score was approved in 1851, and the first performance took place on 30 April 1852 at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg. The censors however insisted that the title be rendered as \"The Battle of Kulikovo\". Rubinstein wrote to his mother 'This is not so terrible. The public will gradually find out what the real names are'. The composer was pleased by the reception, although he complained about the quality of the singers: nonetheless he reported that 'The success was enthusiastic!'

{"id": "35285791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35285791", "title": "ExoMars (rover)", "text": "ExoMars (rover)\n\nThe ExoMars rover is a planned robotic Mars rover, part of the international ExoMars programme led by the European Space Agency and the Russian Roscosmos State Corporation.\n\nThe plan calls for a Russian launch vehicle, an ESA carrier module and a Russian lander that will deploy the rover to Mars' surface, scheduled to launch in July 2020. Once safely landed, the solar powered rover would begin a seven-month (218-sol) mission to search for the existence of past life on Mars. The ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, launched in 2016, will operate as the rover's data-relay satellite.\n\nThe rover is an autonomous six-wheeled terrain vehicle originally planned and designed to weigh up to , approximately 60% more than NASA's 2004 Mars Exploration Rovers \"Spirit\" and \"Opportunity\", but about one third that of NASA's \"Curiosity\" rover launched in 2011.\n\nIn February 2012, following NASA's withdrawal from this project, ESA went back to a design for a smaller rover previously calculated to be . Instrumentation will consist of the exobiology laboratory suite, known as \"Pasteur analytical laboratory\" to look for signs of biomolecules or biosignatures from past life. Among other instruments, the rover will also carry a sub-surface drill to pull up samples for its on-board laboratory.\n\nThe lead builder of the ExoMars rover, the British division of Airbus Defence and Space, began procuring critical components in March 2014. In December 2014, ESA member states approved the funding for the rover, to be sent on the second launch in 2018, but insufficient funds had already started to threaten a launch delay until 2020. The wheels and suspension system are paid by the Canadian Space Agency and are being manufactured by MDA Corporation in Canada.\n\nBy March 2013, the spacecraft was scheduled to launch in 2018 with a Mars landing in early 2019. However, delays in European and Russian industrial activities and deliveries of scientific payloads, forced the launch to be pushed back. In May 2016, ESA announced that the mission had been moved to the next available launch window of July 2020. ESA ministerial meetings in December 2016 reviewed mission issues including ExoMars funding and lessons learned from the ExoMars 2016 \"Schiaparelli\" mission. One concern is that the \"Schiaparelli\" module crashed during its Mars atmospheric entry, and this landing system is being produced with some subsystems in near duplication for the ExoMars lander.\n\nIn July 2018, the European Space Agency launched a public outreach campaign to choose a name for the rover.\n\nThe ExoMars mission requires the rover to be capable of driving across the Martian terrain per sol to enable it to meet its science objectives. The rover is designed to operate at least seven months and drive , after landing.\n\nSince the rover communicates with the ground controllers via the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, and the orbiter only passes over the rover approximately twice per sol, the ground controllers will not be able to actively guide the rover across the surface. The ExoMars Rover is therefore designed to navigate autonomously across the Martian surface. A pair of stereo cameras allow the rover to build up a 3D map of the terrain, which the navigation software then uses to assess the terrain around the rover so that it avoids obstacles and finds an efficient route to the ground controller specified destination.\n\nOn 27 March 2014, a \"Mars Yard\" was opened at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage, UK, to facilitate the development and testing of the rover's autonomous navigation system. The yard is and contains of sand and rocks designed to mimic the terrain of the Martian environment.\n\nThe rover will search for two types of subsurface life signatures, morphological and chemical. It will not analyse atmospheric samples, and it has no dedicated meteorological station, but the ExoMars 2020 surface platform that will deploy the rover is equipped with a meteorological station. The scientific payload is as follows:\n\nThe PanCam has been designed to perform digital terrain mapping for the rover and to search for morphological signatures of past biological activity preserved on the texture of surface rocks. The PanCam assembly includes two wide angle cameras for multi-spectral stereoscopic panoramic imaging, and a high resolution camera for high-resolution colour imaging. The PanCam will also support the scientific measurements of other instruments by taking high-resolution images of locations that are difficult to access, such as craters or rock walls, and by supporting the selection of the best sites to carry out exobiology studies. Stained glass calibration targets will provide a UV-stable reflectance and colour reference for the PanCam, ISEM and CLUPI instruments, allowing for the generation of calibrated data products.\n\nThe present environment on Mars is exceedingly hostile for the widespread proliferation of surface life: it is too cold and dry and receives large doses of solar UV radiation as well as cosmic radiation. Notwithstanding these hazards, basic microorganisms or their ancient remains may be found in protected places underground or within rock cracks and inclusions. Sampling from beneath the Martian surface with the intent to reach and analyze material unaltered or minimally affected by cosmic radiation is the strongest advantage of the ExoMars rover. The ExoMars core drill was fabricated in Italy and is called DEEDRI. It is designed to acquire soil samples down to a maximum depth of in a variety of soil types. The drill will acquire a core sample in diameter by in length, extract it and deliver it to the inlet port of the Rover Payload Module, where the sample will be distributed, processed and analyzed. The ExoMars drill embeds the Mars Multispectral Imager for Subsurface Studies (Ma-Miss) which is a miniaturised infrared spectrometer devoted to the borehole exploration. The system will complete experiment cycles and at least two vertical surveys down to 2 metres (with four sample acquisitions each). This means that a minimum number of 17 samples shall be acquired and delivered by the drill for subsequent analysis. The drill mechanism transfers the sample to the sample container that presents the material to three analytic instruments: MicrOmega-IR, MOMA and Raman Laser Spectrometer.\n\nThe science package in the ExoMars rover will hold a variety of instruments collectively called \"Pasteur suite\"; these instruments will study the environment for habitability, and possible past biosignatures on Mars. These instruments are placed internally and used to study collected samples:\n\n\n\n\nNASA's Mars rover \"Spirit\" got stuck permanently in soft sand in 2009, so European engineers are assessing the option of including a \"scout\" micro rover to prod the ground 5 meters ahead of this primary rover to improve the mission safety and speed by determining the suitability of the terrain. The scout rover study is called \"FASTER\" (Forward Acquisition of Soil and Terrain Data for Exploration Rover), and it is a European consortium of six partners from five EU member states. Both rovers would collaborate autonomously during their mission; \"FASTER\" would be equipped with a Soil Sensing System (SSS) to analyse soil and terrain properties for hazardous soft sand traction. The micro rover would dock to the primary rover for energy transfer, or potentially, be stowed on board and be released when required. The estimated dimensions of the scout rover are 40 x 83 x 50 cm (H x L x W) with a mass of 10 to 15 kg.\n\nThe proposed payload has changed several times. The last major change was after the program switched from the larger rover concept back to the previous rover design in 2012.\n\n\nAfter a review by an ESA-appointed panel, a short list of four sites was formally recommended in October 2014 for further detailed analysis. These landing sites exhibit evidence of a complex aqueous history in the past.\n\nOn 21 October 2015, Oxia Planum was chosen as the preferred landing site for the ExoMars rover, with Aram Dorsum and Mawrth Vallis as backup options. In March 2017 the Landing Site Selection Working Group narrowed the choice to Oxia Planum and Mawrth Vallis, and in November 2018, Oxia Planum was once again chosen, and it still needs to be signed off by the heads of the European and Russian space agencies.\n\nAfter the ExoMars 2020 surface platform lands, it will deploy ramps to deploy the ExoMars rover to the surface. The platform will remain stationary and will start a one-year mission to investigate the surface environment at the landing site.\n\n\n"}

It was Bakshi's feature film debut and is loosely based on the Fritz the Cat comic strips by Robert Crumb. It was the first animated feature film to receive an X rating in the United States.\n\nThe film stars Fritz (voiced by Skip Hinnant), an anthropomorphic cat in mid-1960s New York City who explores the ideals of hedonism and sociopolitical consciousness. The film is a satire focusing on American college life of the era, race relations, the free love movement, and left- and right-wing politics.\n\nThe film had a troubled production history and controversial release. Crumb had disagreements with the filmmakers over the film's political content. \"Fritz the Cat\" was controversial for its rating and content, which many viewers at the time found to be offensive. It was produced on a budget of $700,000 and grossed over $90 million worldwide. Its success led to a slew of other X-rated animated films and a sequel, \"The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat\" (1974), made without Crumb's or Bakshi's involvement.\n\nIn a New York City park, hippies have gathered with guitars to sing protest songs. Fritz and his buddies show up in an attempt to meet girls. When a trio of attractive females walk by, Fritz and his friends exhaust themselves trying to get their attention, but find that the girls are more interested in the crow standing a few feet away. The girls attempt to flirt with the crow, making unintentionally condescending remarks about blacks, while Fritz looks on in annoyance. Suddenly, the crow rebukes the girls with a snide remark, indicates that he is gay and walks away. Fritz invites the girls to \"seek the truth\", bringing them up to his friend's apartment, where a wild party is taking place. Since the other rooms are crowded, Fritz drags the girls into the bathroom and the four of them have group sex in the bathtub.\n\nMeanwhile, the police (portrayed as pigs) arrive to raid the party. As the two officers walk up the stairs, one of the party-goers finds Fritz and the girls in the bath tub. Several others jump in, pushing Fritz to the side where he takes solace in marijuana. The two officers break into the apartment, but find that it is empty because everyone has moved into the bathroom. Fritz takes refuge in the toilet when one of the pigs enters the bathroom and begins to beat up the partygoers. As the pig becomes exhausted, a very stoned Fritz jumps out, grabs the pig's gun, and shoots the toilet, causing the water main to break and flooding everybody out of the apartment. The pigs chase Fritz down the street into a synagogue. Fritz manages to escape when the congregation gets up to celebrate the United States' decision to send more weapons into Israel.\n\nFritz makes it back to his dormitory, where his roommates ignore him. He decides to ditch his bore of a life and sets all of his notes and books on fire. The fire spreads throughout the dorm, finally setting the entire building ablaze. In a bar in Harlem, Fritz meets Duke the Crow at a billiard table. After narrowly avoiding getting into a fight with the bartender, Duke invites Fritz to \"bug out\", and they steal a car, which Fritz drives off a bridge, leading Duke to save his life by grabbing onto a railing. The two arrive at the apartment of a drug dealer named Bertha, whose cannabis joints increase Fritz's libido. While having sex with Bertha, he comes to a realization that he \"must tell the people about the revolution!\" He runs off into the city street and incites a riot, during which Duke is shot and killed.\n\nFritz hides in an alley where his older fox girlfriend, Winston Schwartz, finds him and drags him on a road trip to San Francisco. When the car runs out of gas in the middle of the desert, he decides to abandon her. He later meets up with Blue, a heroin-addicted Nazi rabbit biker. Along with Blue's horse girlfriend, Harriet, they take a ride to an underground hide-out, where several other revolutionaries tell Fritz of their plan to blow up a power station.\n\nWhen Harriet tries to get Blue to leave with her to go to a Chinese restaurant, he hits her several times and ties her down with a chain. When Fritz objects to their treatment of her, he is hit in the face with a candle by a member of the group. Blue and the other revolutionaries then gang-rape her. After setting the dynamite at the power plant, Fritz suddenly has a change of heart, and unsuccessfully attempts to remove it before being caught in the explosion. At a Los Angeles hospital, Harriet (disguised as a nun) and the girls from the New York park come to comfort him in what they believe to be his last moments. Fritz, after reciting the speech he used to pick up the girls from New York, becomes revitalized and has sex with the trio of girls while Harriet watches in astonishment.\n\n\nRobert Crumb (b. 1943) was still a teenager when he created the character Fritz the Cat for self-published comics magazines he made with his older brother Charles. The character first appeared to a wider public in Harvey Kurtzman's humor magazine \"Help!\" in 1965. The strips place anthropomorphic characters—normally associated with children's comics—in stories with drugs, sex, and other adult-oriented content. Crumb left his wife in 1967 and moved to San Francisco, where he took part in the counterculture and indulged in drugs such as LSD. He had countercultural strips published in underground periodicals and in 1968 published the first issue of \"Zap Comix\". Crumb's cartoons became progressively more transgressive, sexually explicit, and violent, and Crumb became the center of the burgeoning underground comix movement. Fritz became one of Crumb's best-known creations, particularly outside the counterculture.\n\nRalph Bakshi majored in cartooning at the High School of Art and Design. He learned his trade at the Terrytoons studio in New York City, where he spent ten years animating characters such as Mighty Mouse, Heckle and Jeckle, and Deputy Dawg. At the age of 29, Bakshi was hired to head the animation division of Paramount Pictures as both writer and director, where he produced four experimental short films before the studio closed in 1967. With producer Steve Krantz, Bakshi founded his own studio, Bakshi Productions. In 1969, Ralph's Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and \"Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse\", a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. In a 1971 article for the \"Los Angeles Times\" Bakshi said that the idea of \"grown men sitting in cubicles drawing butterflies floating over a field of flowers, while American planes are dropping bombs in Vietnam and kids are marching in the streets, is ludicrous.\" Bakshi soon developed \"Heavy Traffic\", a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi's lack of film experience.\n\nWhile browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark's Place, Bakshi came across a copy of \"R. Crumb's Fritz the Cat\" (1969). Impressed by Crumb's sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film. Bakshi was interested in directing the film because he felt that Crumb's work was the closest to his own. Krantz arranged a meeting with Crumb, during which Bakshi showed Crumb drawings that had been created as the result of Bakshi attempting to learn Crumb's style to prove that he could translate the look of Crumb's artwork to animation. Impressed by Bakshi's tenacity, Crumb lent him one of his sketchbooks as a reference.\n\nAs Krantz began to prepare the paperwork, preparation began on a pitch presentation for potential studios, including a poster-sized painted cel setup featuring the strip's cast against a traced photo background, as Bakshi intended the film to appear. In spite of Crumb's enthusiasm, he was unsure about the film's production, and refused to sign the contract. Cartoonist Vaughn Bodé warned Bakshi against working with Crumb, describing him as \"slick\". Bakshi later agreed with Bodé's assessment, calling Crumb \"one of the slickest hustlers you'll ever see in your life\". Krantz sent Bakshi to San Francisco, where Bakshi stayed with Crumb and his wife Dana in an attempt to persuade Crumb to sign the contract. After a week, Crumb left, leaving the film's production status uncertain, but Dana had power of attorney and signed the contract. Crumb received US$50,000, which was delivered throughout different phases of the production, in addition to ten percent of Krantz's take.\n\nWith the rights to the character, Krantz and Bakshi set out to find a distributor. \"When I say that every major distributor turned it down, this is not an exaggeration\", remembers Krantz. \"There has never been a project that was received with less enthusiasm. Animation is essentially a dirty word for distributors, who think that only Disney can paint a tree, and in addition to that, \"Fritz\" was so far out that there was a failure to understand that we were onto something very important.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1970, Warner Bros. agreed to fund and distribute the film. The Harlem sequences were the first to be completed. Krantz intended to release these scenes as a 15-minute short if the film's funding was pulled; Bakshi was nevertheless determined to complete the film as a feature. Late in November, Bakshi and Krantz screened a presentation reel for the studio with this sequence, pencil tests, and shots of Bakshi's storyboards. Bakshi stated, \"You should have seen their faces in the screening room when I first screened a bit of \"Fritz\". I'll remember their faces until I die. One of them left the room. Holy hell, you should have seen his face. 'Shut \"up\", Frank! This is not the movie you're allowed to make!' And I said, Bullshit, I just made it.\"\n\nThe film's budget is disputed. In 1972, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" stated that \"Fritz the Cat\" recouped its costs in four months following its release. A year later the magazine reported that the film grossed $30 million worldwide and was produced on a budget of $1.3 million. In 1993, director Ralph Bakshi said \"\"Fritz the Cat\", to me, was an enormous budget -- at $850,000 -- compared to my Terrytoon budgets ...\" In an intereview published in 1980, Bakshi stated \"We made the film for $700,000. Complete\".\n\nWarner executives wanted the sexual content toned down, and to cast big names for the voices. Bakshi refused, and Warner pulled their funding from the film, leading Krantz to seek funds elsewhere. This led to a deal with Jerry Gross, the owner of Cinemation Industries, a distributor specializing in exploitation films. Although Bakshi did not have enough time to pitch the film, Gross agreed to fund its production and distribute it, believing that it would fit in with his grindhouse slate. Further financing came from Saul Zaentz, who agreed to distribute the soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label.\n\nBakshi was initially reluctant to direct \"Fritz the Cat\" because he had spent years working on animated productions featuring animal characters and wanted to make films focusing on human characters. He became interested in working on the film because he loved Crumb's work and considered him a \"total genius\". During the development of the film, Bakshi says that he \"started to get giddy\" when he \"suddenly was able to get a pig that was a cop, and this particular other pig was Jewish, and I thought, 'Oh my God—a Jewish pig?' These were major steps forward, because in the initial \"Heckle and Jeckle\" for Terrytoons, they were two black guys running around. Which was hysterically funny and, I think, great—like Uncle Remus stuff. But they didn't play down south, and they had to change two black crows to two Englishmen. And I always told him that the black crows were funnier. So it was a slow awakening.\"\n\nIn his notes to animator Cosmo Anzilotti, Bakshi is precise, and even specifies that the crows smoked marijuana rather than tobacco. Bakshi states that \"The weed had to read on screen. It's an important character detail.\" The film's opening sequence sets the satirical tone of the film. The setting of the story's period is not only established by a title, but also by a voiceover by Bakshi playing a character giving his account of the 1960s: \"happy times, heavy times\". The film's opening dialogue, by three construction workers on their lunch break, establishes many of the themes discussed in the film, including drug use, promiscuity, and the social and political climate of the era. When one of the workers urinates off of the scaffold, the film's credits play over a shot of the liquid falling against a black screen. When the credits end, it is shown that the construction worker has urinated on a long-haired hippie with a guitar. Karl F. Cohen writes that the film \"is a product of the radical politics of the period. Bakshi's depiction of Fritz's life is colorful, funny, sexist, raw, violent, and outrageous.\"\n\nOf his direction of the film, Bakshi stated, \"My approach to animation as a director is live action. I don't approach it in the traditional animation ways. None of our characters get up and sing, because that's not the type of picture I'm trying to do. I want people to believe my characters are real, and it's hard to believe they're real if they start walking down the street singing.\" Bakshi wanted the film to be the antithesis of any animated film produced by the Walt Disney Company. Accordingly, \"Fritz the Cat\" includes two satirical references to Disney. In one scene, silhouettes of Mickey Mouse, Daisy Duck, and Donald Duck are shown cheering on the United States Air Force as it drops napalm on a black neighborhood during a riot. Another scene features a reference to the \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" sequence from \"Dumbo\". A sequence of the camera panning across a garbage heap in an abandoned lot in Harlem sets up a visual device which recurs in \"Hey Good Lookin'\".\n\nThe original screenplay consisted mostly of dialog and featured only a few changes from Crumb's stories. The script and storyboards went largely unused in favor of more experimental storytelling techniques. Bakshi said, \"I don't like to jump ahead on my films. The way you feel about a film on Day One, you may not feel the same way forty weeks down the road. Characters grow, so I wanted to have the option to change things, and strengthen my characters  ... It was sort of a stream of consciousness, and a learning process for myself.\" Bakshi wrote the characters without feral animal behavior to lend the material greater realism.\n\nThe first part of the film's plot was adapted from a self-titled story published in a 1968 issue of \"R. Crumb's Head Comix\", while the second part is derived from \"Fritz Bugs Out\", which was serialized in the February to October 1968 issues of \"Cavalier\", and the final part of the story contains elements of \"Fritz the No-Good\", first published in the September/October 1968 issue of \"Cavalier\". The last half of the film makes a major departure from Crumb's work. Animation historian Michael Barrier describes this section of the film as being \"much grimmer than Crumb's stories past that point, and far more violent.\" Bakshi stated that he deviated from the comics because he felt that the strips lacked depth:\n\nIt was cute, it was sweet, but there was nowhere to put it. That's why Crumb hates the picture, because I slipped a couple of things in there that he despises, like the rabbis—the pure Jewish stuff. Fritz can't hold that kind of commentary. Winston is 'just a typical Jewish broad from Brooklyn'.  ... [The strip] was cute and well-done, but there was nothing that had that much depth.\n\nBakshi's unwillingness to use anthropomorphic characters that behaved like feral animals led him to rewrite a scene in \"Fritz Bugs Out\" where Duke saves Fritz's life by flying while holding Fritz; in the film, Duke grabs a railing before the car crashes into the river, a solution that Bakshi wasn't entirely satisfied with, but prevented him from having to use any feral animal behavior in that scene.\n\nIn the film, there are two characters named \"Winston\" – one appears at the beginning and end of the film, the other is Fritz's girlfriend Winston Schwartz. Michael Barrier notes that Winston Schwartz (who appears prominently in \"Fritz Bugs Out\" and \"Fritz the No-Good\") never has a proper introduction in Bakshi's film, and interprets the naming of a separate character as Bakshi's attempt to reconcile this; however, the two characters look and sound nothing alike. Bakshi intended to end the film with Fritz's death, but Krantz objected to this ending, and Bakshi eventually changed it to the final ending.\n\nThe film's voice cast includes Skip Hinnant, Rosetta LeNoire, John McCurry, Judy Engles, and comic book distributor/convention organizer Phil Seuling. Hinnant, who would become known as a featured performer on \"The Electric Company\", was cast because he \"had such a naturally phony voice\", according to Bakshi. Bakshi and Seuling improvised their dialogue as comically inept pig officers; Bakshi enjoyed working as a voice actor and later went on to provide voice roles for some of his other films. Bakshi re-created the voice he did in this film for the part of a storm trooper in his 1977 animated science fiction film \"Wizards\".\n\nSome scenes used documentary recordings which were made by Bakshi and edited to fit the scene; these were used because Bakshi wanted the film to \"feel real\". According to Bakshi, \"I made tons and tons of tapes.  ... When I went to have the film mixed, the sound engineers gave me all kinds of crap about the tracks not being professionally recorded; they didn't even want to mix the noise of bottles breaking in the background, street noise, tape hiss, all kinds of shit. They said it was unprofessional, but I didn't care.\" Although the sound designers insisted that Bakshi needed to re-record the dialogue in the studio, Bakshi persisted on their inclusion.\n\nAlmost all of the film's dialogue, except for that of a few of the main characters, was recorded entirely on the streets of New York City. For the film's opening sequence, Bakshi paid two construction workers US$50 each, and drank Scotch with them, recording the conversation. In the Washington Square Park sequence, only Skip Hinnant was a professional actor; Fritz's friends were voiced by young males Bakshi found in the park. One of the sequences that was not based upon Crumb's comics involved a comic chase through a synagogue full of praying rabbis. For the voices of the rabbis, Bakshi used a documentary recording of his father and uncles. This scene continued to have a personal significance on Bakshi after his father and uncle died. Bakshi states, \"Thank God I have their voices. I have my dad and family praying. It's so nice to hear now.\" Bakshi also went to a Harlem bar with a tape recorder and spent hours talking to black patrons, getting drunk with them as he asked them questions.\n\nThe film's score was composed by Ed Bogas and Ray Shanklin. The soundtrack was released by Fantasy Records and Ampex Tapes, along with the single, \"You're the Only Girl\" b/w \"Winston\". The film also featured songs by Charles Earland, Cal Tjader, Bo Diddley, and Billie Holiday. Bakshi bought the rights to use Holiday's performance of the song \"Yesterdays\" for $35.\n\nMany of the animators who worked on the film were professionals that Bakshi had previously worked with at Terrytoons, including Jim Tyer, John Gentilella, Nick Tafuri, Martin Taras, Larry Riley, and Cliff Augustine. According to Bakshi, it took quite a long time to assemble the right staff. Those who entered with a smirk, \"wanting to be very dirty and draw filthy pictures\", did not stay very long, and neither did those with a low tolerance for vulgarity. One cartoonist refused to draw a black crow shooting a pig policeman. Two female animators quit; one because she could not bring herself to tell her children what she did for a living, the other because she refused to draw exposed breasts.\n\nIn order to save money by eliminating the need for model sheets, Bakshi let animator John Sparey draw some of the first sequences of Fritz. Bakshi states that he knew that \"Sparey would execute them beautifully.\" Poses from his sequences were photocopied and handed out to the rest of the crew. The film was produced almost entirely without pencil tests. According to Bakshi, \"We pencil tested I'd say a thousand feet [of footage], tops. ... We do a major feature without pencil tests—that's tough. The timing falls off. I can always tell an animator to draw it better, and I know if the attitude of the characters is right, but the timing you really can't see.\" Bakshi had to judge the timing of the animation simply by flipping an animator's drawings in his hand, until he could see the completed animation on the screen. Veteran Warner Bros. animator Ted Bonnicksen was incredibly dedicated to his work on the film, to the point where he completed his animation for the synagogue sequence while suffering from leukemia, and would take the scenes home at night to work on them.\n\nIn May 1971, Bakshi moved his studio to Los Angeles to hire additional animators there. Some animators, including Rod Scribner, Dick Lundy, Virgil Walter Ross, Norman McCabe, and John Sparey, welcomed Bakshi's presence, and felt that \"Fritz the Cat\" would bring diversity to the animation industry. Other animators disliked Bakshi's presence, and placed an advertisement in \"The Hollywood Reporter\", stating that Bakshi's \"filth\" was unwelcome in California. According to Bakshi, \"I didn't know who these guys were because I was from New York, so I threw the ad away.\" However, Bakshi found the negative reaction to the film from his peers to be disheartening.\n\nBecause it was cheaper for Ira Turek to trace photographs to create the backgrounds, Bakshi and Johnnie Vita walked around the streets of the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem to take moody snapshots. Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds stylized realism that had never been portrayed in animation before. After Turek completed a background drawing in ink on an animation cel, the drawing would be photocopied onto watercolor paper for Vita and onto animation paper for use in matching the characters to the backgrounds. When Vita finished his painting, Turek's original drawing, on the cel, would be placed over the watercolor, obscuring the photocopy lines on the painting. However, not every background was taken from live-action sources. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced by the \"Ash Can style\" of painters, which includes George Luks and John French Sloan. The film also used bent and fisheye camera perspectives in order to replicate the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city.\n\nBy the time production finished, Cinemation had released Melvin Van Peebles' \"Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song\" to considerable success, and the distributor hoped that \"Fritz the Cat\" would be even more profitable. \"Fritz\" received an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America, the first animated film to receive such rating. Producer Krantz stated that the film lost playdates due to the rating, and 30 American newspapers rejected display advertisements for it or refused to give it editorial publicity. The film's limited screenings led Cinemation to exploit the film's content in its promotion of the film, advertising it as containing \"90 minutes of violence, excitement, and SEX  ... he's X-rated and animated!\" According to Ralph Bakshi, \"We almost didn't deliver the picture, because of the exploitation of it.\"\n\nCinemation's advertising style and the film's rating led many to believe that \"Fritz the Cat\" was a pornographic film. When it was introduced as such at a showing at the University of Southern California, Bakshi stated firmly, \"\"Fritz the Cat\" is not pornographic.\" In May 1972, \"Variety\" reported that Krantz had appealed the X rating, saying \"Animals having sex isn't pornography.\" The MPAA refused to hear the appeal. The misconceptions about the film's content were eventually cleared up when it received praise from \"Rolling Stone\" and \"The New York Times\", and the film was accepted into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival. Bakshi later stated, \"Now they do as much on \"The Simpsons\" as I got an X rating for \"Fritz the Cat\".\"\n\nBefore the film's release, American distributors attempted to cash in on the publicity garnered from the rating by rushing out dubbed versions of two other adult animated films from Japan, both of which featured an X rating in their advertising material: \"Senya ichiya monogatari\" and \"Kureopatora\", re-titled \"One Thousand and One Arabian Nights\" and \"Cleopatra: Queen of Sex\". However, neither film was actually submitted to the MPAA, and it is not likely that either feature would have received an X rating. The film \"Down and Dirty Duck\" was promoted with an X rating, but had not been submitted to the MPAA. The French-Belgian animated film \"\" was initially released with an X rating in a subtitled version, but a dubbed version released in 1979 received an R rating.\n\nFor the DVD release, MGM Home Entertainment has surrendered the X rating for an unrated video release, although the tagline \"He's X-Rated and Animated!\" is still used on the cover. Also, the MPAA \"This film has been rated X\" screen is seen just before the MGM logo at the end of the film on the DVD.\n\n\"Fritz the Cat\" opened on April 12, 1972, in Hollywood and Washington, D.C. Although the film only had a limited release, it went on to become a worldwide hit. Against its $700,000 budget, it grossed $25 million in the United States and over $90 million worldwide, and was the most successful independent animated feature of all time. The film earned $4.7 million in video rentals in North America.\n\nIn Michael Barrier's 1972 article on its production, Bakshi gives accounts of two screenings of the film. Of the reactions to the film by audiences at a preview screening in Los Angeles, Bakshi stated, \"They forget it's animation. They treat it like a film.  ... This is the real thing, to get people to take animation seriously.\" Bakshi was also present at a showing of the film at the Museum of Modern Art and remembers, \"Some guy asked me why I was against the revolution. The point is, animation was making people get up off their asses and get mad.\"\n\nThe film also sparked negative reactions because of its content. \"A lot of people got freaked out\", says Bakshi. \"The people in charge of the power structure, the people in charge of magazines and the people going to work in the morning who loved Disney and Norman Rockwell, thought I was a pornographer, and they made things very difficult for me. The younger people, the people who could take new ideas, were the people I was addressing. I wasn't addressing the whole world. To those people who loved it, it was a huge hit, and everyone else wanted to kill me.\"\n\nCritical reaction was mixed, but generally positive. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote that the film is \"constantly funny  ... [There's] something to offend just about everyone.\" \"New York\" magazine film critic Judith Crist reviewed the film as \"a gloriously funny, brilliantly pointed, and superbly executed entertainment  ... [whose] target is  ... the muddle-headed radical chicks and slicks of the sixties\", and that it \"should change the face of the animated cartoon forever\". Paul Sargent Clark in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" called the film \"powerful and audacious\", while \"Newsweek\" called it \"a harmless, mindless, pro-youth saga calculated to shake up only the box office\". \"The Wall Street Journal\" and \"Cue\" both gave the film mixed reviews. Thomas Albright of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote an enthusiastic preview in the December 9, 1971 issue based on seeing thirty minutes of the film, declaring that it was \"sure to mark the most important breakthrough in animation since \"Yellow Submarine\"\". But in a review published after its release, Albright recanted his earlier statement and wrote that the visuals were not enough to save the finished product from being a \"qualified disaster\" due to a \"leaden plot\" and a \"juvenile\" script that relied too heavily on tired gags and tasteless ethnic humor. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 58%, based on 19 critic reviews, with an average rating of 5.5/10.\n\nFilm critic Andrew Osmond wrote that the epilogue hurt the film's integrity for \"giving Fritz cartoon powers of survival that the film had rejected until then\".\n\nPatricia Evans found scenes with Jewish stereotypes \"vicious and offensive\", and stated, \"Only the jaundiced eye of director Ralph Bakshi, which denigrates all of the characters, the hero included, makes one reflect on the nature of the attack.\"\n\nCrumb first saw the film in February 1972, during a visit to Los Angeles with fellow underground cartoonists Spain Rodriguez, S. Clay Wilson, Robert Williams, and Rick Griffin. According to Bakshi, Crumb was dissatisfied with the film. Among his criticisms, he said that he felt that Skip Hinnant was wrong for the voice of Fritz, and said that Bakshi should have voiced the character instead. Crumb later said in an interview that he felt that the film was \"really a reflection of Ralph Bakshi's confusion, you know. There's something real repressed about it. In a way, it's more twisted than my stuff. It's really twisted in some kind of weird, unfunny way.  ... I didn't like that sex attitude in it very much. It's like real repressed horniness; he's kind of letting it out compulsively.\" Crumb also criticized the film's condemnation of the radical left, denouncing Fritz's dialogue in the final sequences of the film, which includes a quote from The Beatles song \"The End\", as \"red-neck and fascistic\" and stated, \"They put words into his mouth that I never would have had him say.\"\n\nReportedly, Crumb filed a lawsuit to have his name removed from the film's credits. San Francisco copyright attorney Albert L. Morse said that no suit was filed, but an agreement was reached to remove Crumb's name from the credits. However, Crumb's name has remained in the final film since its original theatrical release. In response to his distaste for the film, Crumb had \"Fritz the Cat—Superstar\" published in \"People's Comics\" later in 1972, in which a jealous girlfriend kills Fritz with an icepick; he has refused to use the character again, and wrote the filmmakers a letter saying not to use his characters in their films. Crumb later cited the film as \"one of those experiences I sort of block out. The last time I saw it was when I was making an appearance at a German art school in the mid-1980s, and I was forced to watch it with the students. It was an excruciating ordeal, a humiliating embarrassment. I recall Victor Moscoso was the only one who warned me, 'if you don't stop this film from being made, you are going to regret it for the rest of your life'—and he was right.\"\n\nIn a 2008 interview, Bakshi referred to Crumb as a \"hustler\" and stated, \"He goes in so many directions that he's hard to pin down. I spoke to him on the phone. We both had the same deal, five percent. They finally sent Crumb the money and not me. Crumb always gets what he wants, including that château of his in France.  ... I have no respect for Crumb. Is he a good artist? Yes, if you want to do the same thing over and over. He should have been my best friend for what I did with \"Fritz the Cat\". I drew a good picture, and we both made out fine.\" Bakshi also stated that Crumb threatened to disassociate himself from any cartoonist that worked with Bakshi, which would have hurt their chances at getting work published.\n\nIn addition to other animated films aimed at adult audiences, the film's success led to the production of a sequel, \"The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat\". Although producer Krantz and voice actor Hinnant returned for the follow-up, Bakshi did not. Instead, \"Nine Lives\" was directed by animator Robert Taylor, who co-wrote the film with Fred Halliday and Eric Monte. \"Nine Lives\" was distributed by American International Pictures, and was considered to be inferior to its predecessor. Both films have been released on DVD in the United States, Canada and the UK. Bakshi states that he felt constricted using anthropomorphic characters in \"Fritz\", and focused solely on non-anthropomorphic characters in \"Heavy Traffic\" and \"Hey Good Lookin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\", but later used anthropomorphic characters in \"Coonskin\".\n\nWhile review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles contemporary reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 56%, the film is widely noted in its innovation for featuring content that had not been portrayed in animation before, such as sexuality and violence, and was also, as John Grant writes in his book \"Masters of Animation\", \"the breakthrough movie that opened brand new vistas to the commercial animator in the United States\", presenting an \"almost disturbingly accurate\" portrayal \"of a particular stratum of Western society during a particular era,  ... as such it has dated very well.\" The film's subject matter and its satirical approach offered an alternative to the kinds of films that had previously been presented by major animation studios. Michael Barrier described \"Fritz the Cat\" and \"Heavy Traffic\" as \"not merely provocative, but highly ambitious\". Barrier described the films as an effort \"to push beyond what was done in the old cartoons, even while building on their strengths\".\n\nAs a result of these innovations, \"Fritz\" was selected by \"Time Out\" magazine as the 42nd greatest animated film, ranked at number 51 on the Online Film Critics Society's list of the top 100 greatest animated films of all time, and was placed at number 56 on Channel 4's list of the \"100 Greatest Cartoons\". Footage from the film was edited into the music video for Guru's 2007 song \"State of Clarity\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4465983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4465983", "title": "Goodbyeee", "text": "Goodbyeee\n\n\"Goodbyeee\", or \"Plan F: Goodbyeee\", is the sixth and final episode of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\", the fourth series of British historical sitcom \"Blackadder\". The episode was first broadcast on BBC1 in the United Kingdom on 2 November 1989, shortly before Armistice Day. Apart from the one-off short film \"\" made a decade later, it was the last episode of \"Blackadder\" to be produced and transmitted.\n\nThe episode depicts its main characters' final hours before a British offensive on the Western Front of the First World War, and Captain Blackadder's attempts to escape his fate by feigning madness; after he fails to convince General Melchett, and Field Marshal Haig's advice proves useless, he resigns himself to taking part in the push. \"Goodbyeee\" has a darker tone than other episodes in the series, culminating in its acclaimed ending in which the main characters are assumed to die in machine-gun fire. The episode's theme of death ties in with the series' use of gallows humour, its criticism and satire of war, and its depiction of authority figures contentedly sending their subordinates to face the enemy, while unwilling to do so themselves.\n\nRichard Curtis and Ben Elton wrote the episode, and further material was provided by cast members. Its final sequence, which shows the main characters going \"over the top\", uses slow motion, as the programme's creators were unhappy with the result of the scripted ending. The enhanced scene has been described as bold and highly poignant.\n\nEach series of \"Blackadder\" depicts its protagonist, always a scheming and (except in the first series) witty man named Edmund Blackadder, in different periods throughout history. In \"Blackadder Goes Forth\", he is Captain Blackadder (Rowan Atkinson), an officer in the British Army on the Western Front during the First World War.\n\nJoined by his colleagues—the poor, stupid and unhygienic Private Baldrick (Tony Robinson), and the overly optimistic, upper-class and equally idiotic Lieutenant George St Barleigh (Hugh Laurie)—Blackadder tries constantly to escape his position and avoid the \"big push\", which he fears will result in his death. His efforts are hindered by the loud and intimidating General Melchett (Stephen Fry) and Melchett's strict, sardonic, and jobsworth staff officer, Captain Darling (Tim McInnerny).\n\nCaptain Blackadder's trench receives a phone call from HQ: a full-scale attack has been ordered for the next day at dawn. Realising that this is likely to mean his death, Blackadder plans to escape by pretending to be mad: he puts underpants on his head and sticks pencils in his nostrils. His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.\n\nMelchett leaves after George declines his offer not to participate in the push, and Baldrick suggests that Blackadder ask Field Marshal Douglas Haig to get them out; remembering that Haig owes him a favour, Blackadder decides to call in the morning. George, Baldrick and Blackadder discuss the War and the friends they have lost—George mentions the Christmas truce of 1914 (in which the belligerents stopped fighting to play football) and realises he is the only \"Trinity Tiddlers\" member still alive; this is paralleled in Baldrick's pets, who have all died. Back at HQ, Melchett surprises Captain Darling with a front-line commission. Darling's pleas to reconsider are misinterpreted, and Melchett insists that he go.\n\nThe following morning, Blackadder calls Field Marshal Haig and reminds him of his debt; Haig reluctantly advises using the underpants method, and abruptly hangs up, sealing Blackadder's fate. Darling arrives, and his animosity with Blackadder dissolves as they are both put in the same situation. George tries to cheer everybody up, but finds himself as scared as the others. Darling states that he had hoped to live through the War, return to England and marry his fiancée.\n\nThe men are called to the trench to prepare for the big push. There is a moment of hope when the British barrage lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, but for the first time in any series, does not call it a \"cunning plan\". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign insanity because \"who would have noticed another madman round here?\" The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous machine-gun fire. The sequence enters slow motion as a slow piano version of the \"Blackadder\" theme is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of no man's land fades into a tranquil field of poppies, with only birdsong to be heard.\n\nThe episode was written by Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, who swapped computer disks to make edits. They stuck to a rule whereby they could not add back material the other had removed. The script was collaboratively edited by the cast members of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" during read-throughs. Elton was primarily responsible for the sequence in which Blackadder explains how the First World War started; the running gag of Baldrick using mud and bodily fluids to make coffee throughout the episode was greatly expanded during rehearsals.\n\nThe episode's title is a reference to the popular First World War song \"Good-bye-ee!\", which was based on a catchphrase of the comedian Harry Tate. The song is also heard in an earlier episode — \"Major Star\". The title is a departure from those of previous \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" episodes, which are puns on military ranks.\n\nDuring the filming of the episode, which took place before a studio audience at BBC Television Centre, Rowan Atkinson described sharing his character's dread of impending death and feeling a \"knot in the pit of my stomach\", something that he had never experienced. Hugh Laurie said that filming was sad because \"even for comic effect, we were representing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people\". Regarding guest star Geoffrey Palmer, the producer John Lloyd said \"[We] probably could have given [him] more attention\", calling him \"a wonderful actor\" who is \"really just delivering three or four plot lines [pieces of dialogue essential to the plot]\".\n\nThe slow motion and fade effects at the end of the episode were not scripted, but the decision to use them was made in editing after the final scene was hastily filmed on an unconvincing polystyrene set, ruining the poignancy of the sequence; the episode's director Richard Boden added the poppy field image. The piano version of the theme tune was performed by Howard Goodall and recorded in a gymnasium, giving it what Lloyd described as a \"liquid, lonely sound\". The episode's end credits were omitted. Tim McInnerny did not know about these changes before the episode aired, and has said that he found the ending particularly emotional.\n\nIn the episode, Field Marshal Haig is shown casually sweeping away toy soldiers with a dustpan and brush; \"BBC News Magazine\"s Finlo Rohrer called this a \"visual allusion to his callousness\", but quoted the historian Gary Sheffield as saying \"The real Field Marshal Haig was certainly not a callous man. He was commanding the largest British army ever. Whatever he did you ended up with lots and lots of casualties.\" Sheffield also noted that \"Melchett is an amalgam of Haig and John French and the other generals\", so Haig effectively \"appears twice\". The series, and the storyline of \"Goodbyeee\" especially, often depicts the \"lions led by donkeys\" perception of the War, an element of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" that has been criticised by historians.\n\nIn his book \"The Great War\", Ian F. W. Beckett also cited Sheffield: the latter commented that \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" was successful because \"the characters and situations needed no explanation, so familiar was the audience with the received version of the war\". Beckett noted the popularity of the episode's final scene, and compared it to a similarly popular one from \"Dad's Army\". He said that this comparison demonstrates the historian A. J. P. Taylor's observation that the Second World War has been regarded as a \"good war\" in comparison to the first; he opined that \"television producers ... have much to answer for in the perpetuation of the image of the Great War as one in which a generation of 'lions' were needlessly sacrificed by the 'donkeys'\".\n\nThe producer John Lloyd cited the episode's lack of another major character as the reason they had time to \"explore the relationships of the five principal people\". Rowan Atkinson said that the scene involving Darling's \"ghastly realisation\" of his commission was \"very sad\"; Lloyd commented \"I love the fact that Captain Darling does have some compassion; he's not just a bureaucrat\". They noted that \"all the comedy just goes away\" upon Darling's arrival in the trench, and that \"there are still funny moments, but dramatically there's no comic content, it's just leading inexorably to the end.\"\n\nComparing the ending scene to those of previous series of \"Blackadder\" in which the main characters were also killed, the writer Richard Curtis commented that \"I think it was by chance that [previous series] ended with Blackadder being killed ... but series four, we did do it very much on purpose.\" He said that he and Elton felt they could use the First World War as a setting if the characters died, considering \"if we did do that ... it would not be too disrespectful, and would actually represent some of the tragedy of the First World War\".\n\nFollowing its original broadcast on BBC1 at 9:30 pm on Thursday, 2 November 1989, the episode was praised for its powerful and memorable ending. One journalist called the scene \"a classy ending to a TV classic\" and the \"Sunday Times\" said that it was \"brave\" and \"properly responsible\" of the writers to end the series poignantly, especially when the episode aired close to Remembrance Day.\n\nThe episode has also been the subject of more recent reviews: Rob Cromwell of \"The Guardian\" listed the final scene among six \"perfect end-of-show finales\", saying of \"Blackadder\": \"It was brilliantly funny throughout, right up until the last 60 seconds\", and praising the writers and producer John Lloyd for \"deliver[ing] a perfectly pitched, poignant ending\". Comparing \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" to the 2012 war serial \"Birdsong\", Alison Graham of the \"Radio Times\" commented that \"Nothing ... evokes the terror of those unspeakable battlefields or leaves such an overwhelming sense of loss as [its characters] going over the top to their certain death\". Den of Geek's Carley Tauchert placed the episode second on her list of \"top 10 TV show endings\", calling it \"one of the greatest interpretations of the madness of war that has ever been put on film\". Reviewing the episode for The A.V. Club, Kate Kulzick described it as \"...a masterpiece, a hilarious and painful crystallization of everything Blackadder does well. It is without a doubt the best episode of the series and more than that, it’s one of the best series finales in television history\". She particularly praised it for \"...its masterful balancing of comedy and tragedy. Both are interspersed throughout, with each character given moments of laugh out loud brilliance and poignant reflection\", concluding that \"...there is no such thing as a perfect television show or episode, but “Goodbyeee” comes dang close\". The academic and theatre director Mary Luckhurst contrasted the regular British comedic treatment of the Second World War with the absence of comedies set in the First World War, until the \"Blackadder\" series, which she considered \"an important British dramatic treatment\" of the War. Of the final episode Luckhurst wrote:\n\"Goodbyeee\" went a good deal further than any other sitcom or comedy, by terminally sending pretty much the entire cast over the top in 1917, into a silence that has ... endured ever since. Many millions of viewers were shocked, and almost all taken aback by the abrupt realization of tragedy amid much-loved national television and after riotous laughter to that sudden and bitter end ...\n\nIn a poll conducted by Channel 4 and \"The Observer\" to determine television's one hundred most memorable moments, the final scene of \"Goodbyeee\" came ninth; it was one of only two entries in the top ten that was not news coverage (the other being a scene from \"Only Fools and Horses\"). The \"Radio Times\" in 2001 asked a panel of comedians, writers and producers to pick their \"50 favourite sitcom moments\"; \"Goodbyeee\" was the only \"Blackadder\" episode included, and was ranked eleventh. The British Film Institute's Screenonline called the episode's ending \"unexpectedly moving\", and noted that, unusually for a comedy programme, it was repeated as part of a serious commemoration of Armistice Day: for its 80th anniversary in 1998. The series' overview from the website of UKTV's channel Gold, which airs repeats of \"Blackadder\", calls the final episode \"a seamless blend of gallows humour and rich poignancy\", and \"a fitting end to an iconic series\". In his segment advocating for \"Blackadder\" to be voted \"Britain's Best Sitcom\", the broadcaster and journalist John Sergeant called the final sequence \"the one sitcom moment with claims to immortality\".\n\nSome historians of the First World War have taken a different view. William Philpott referred to the series, by name, as \"bathetic\" and felt it part of a \"post-facto generalisation of the nature of their war\" that \"sucked in\" even veterans of the conflict. In other words, the First World War soldier had become a \"victim\" in the public consciousness, a circumstance at odds with the historical record. The impact of Blackadder on the public consciousness was so pervasive that Gordon Corrigan referenced it in his book cover copy when he published his book \"Mud, Blood, and Poppycock\", which was an attempt to \"dispel various myths\" about the war.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35826350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35826350", "title": "Greek withdrawal from the eurozone", "text": "Greek withdrawal from the eurozone\n\nA Greek withdrawal from the eurozone is a hypothetical scenario in which Greece withdraws from the Eurozone, likely to allow for the country to deal with its government-debt crisis. , no such withdrawal has occurred, nor is one in prospect. This conjecture has been referred to as \"Grexit\", a portmanteau combining the English words \"Greek\" and \"exit\", and which has been expressed in Greek as ελλέξοδος, (from \"Ελλάς\" + \"έξοδος\"). The term \"Graccident\" (accidental Grexit) was coined for the case that Greece exited the EU and the euro without intention. These terms first came into use in 2012 and have been revitalised at each of the bailouts made available to Greece since then.\n\nProponents of the proposal argue that leaving the euro and reintroducing the drachma would dramatically boost exports and tourism and while discouraging expensive imports and thereby give the Greek economy the possibility to recover and stand on its own feet.\n\nOpponents argue that the proposal would impose excessive hardship on the Greek people, as the short-term effects would be a significant consumption and wealth reduction for the Greek population. This may cause civil unrest in Greece and harm the reputation of the eurozone. Additionally, it could cause Greece to align more with non-EU states.\n\nThe term 'Grexit' was coined by the Citigroup economist Ebrahim Rahbari and was introduced by Rahbari and Citigroup's Global Chief Economist Willem H. Buiter on 6 February 2012.\n\nOn 27 January 2015, two days after an early election of the Greek parliament, Alexis Tsipras, leader of the new Syriza (\"Coalition of the Radical Left\") party, formed a new government. He appointed Yanis Varoufakis as Minister of Finance, a particularly important post in view of the government debt crisis. During 2015 and 2016, the chance of a Grexit or even a 'Graccident' (accidental Grexit) in the near future was widely discussed.\n\nAfter the announcement of the bailout referendum on 27 June 2015 speculation rose. That day BBC News reported that \"default appears inevitable\", though it later removed the online statement. On 29 June 2015 it was announced that Greek banks would remain closed all week, cash withdrawals from banks would be limited to €60 per day, and international money transfers would be limited to urgent pre-approved commercial transfers.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) admitted that its forecast about Greek economy was too optimistic: in 2010 it described Greece's first bailout programme as a holding operation that gave the eurozone time to build a firewall to protect other vulnerable members, but in 2012 the unemployment rate of Greece became about 25 percent, compared to IMF's projection of about 15 percent. IMF conceded that it underestimated the damage that austerity programmes would do to the Greek economy, adding that, in terms of Greece's debt, IMF should have considered a debt restructuring earlier.\n\nAs can be seen from the Figure A, IMF's forecast in the 2010 standby agreement said that the Southern European country would start to grow in real terms after 2011. But in fact the economy continued to shrink, and Greek real GDP in 2013 was about 76 percent of that in 2008.\n\nIn mid-May 2012, the financial crisis in Greece and the impossibility of forming a new government after elections led to strong speculation that Greece would leave the eurozone shortly. This phenomenon had already become known as \"Grexit\".\n\nEconomists who favour this approach to solve the Greek debt crisis argue that a default is unavoidable for Greece in the long term, and that a delay in organising an orderly default (by lending Greece more money throughout a few more years) would just wind up hurting EU lenders and neighbouring European countries even more. Fiscal austerity or a euro exit is the alternative to accepting differentiated government bond yields within the Euro Area. If Greece remains in the euro while accepting higher bond yields, reflecting its high government deficit, then high interest rates would dampen demand, raise savings and slow the economy. An improved trade performance and less reliance on foreign capital would be the result.\n\nThe implementation of Grexit would have to occur \"within days or even hours of the decision being made\" due to the high volatility that would result. It would have to be timed at one of the public holidays in Greece.\nOne US economist has argued that the legal grounds upon which the \"troika,\" composed by the EU Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF, has pursued the harsh macroeconomic adjustment plans imposed on Greece are shaky, claiming they infringe upon Greece's sovereignty and interfere in the internal affairs of an independent EU nation-state: \"the overt infringements on Greek sovereignty we're witnessing today, with EU policy makers now double-checking all national data and carefully 'monitoring' the work of the Greek government sets a dangerous precedent.\"\nHe argues that a withdrawal from the Eurozone would give the Greek government more room for maneuver to conduct public policies propitious for long-term growth and social equity.\n\n\"Plan Z\" is the name given to a 2012 plan to enable Greece to withdraw from the eurozone in the event of Greek bank collapse. It was drawn up in absolute secrecy by small teams totalling approximately two dozen officials at the EU Commission (Brussels), the European Central Bank (Frankfurt) and the IMF (Washington). Those officials were headed by Jörg Asmussen (ECB), Thomas Wieser (Euro working group), Poul Thomsen (IMF) and Marco Buti (European Commission). To prevent premature disclosure no single document was created, no emails were exchanged, and no Greek officials were informed. The plan was based on the 2003 introduction of new dinars into Iraq by the Americans and would have required rebuilding the Greek economy and banking system \"ab initio\", including isolating Greek banks by disconnecting them from the TARGET2 system, closing ATMs, and imposing capital and currency controls.\n\nThe prospect of Greece leaving the euro and dealing with a devalued drachma prompted many people to start withdrawing their euros from the country's banks. In the nine months to March 2012 deposits in Greek banks had already fallen 13% to .\n\nA victory for anti-bailout lawmakers in the 17 June 2012 election would likely trigger an even bigger bank run, said Dimitris Mardas, associate professor of economics at the University of Thessaloniiki. Greek authorities, Mardas predicted, would respond by imposing controls on the movement of money for as long as it takes for the panic to subside.\n\nAgainst this plan, a political initiative, the so-called Menoume Europi was founded in 2012 by students in Oxford University, and it spread among Greek students in other European universities. The first demonstration took place in Athens, Syntagma Square in June 2012 in between two major elections that brought to the country political instability and financial insecurity.\n\nA Grexit, assuming that it coincided with adoption of a new currency, would require preparation, for example with capacity for banknote stamping or printing a stock of new banknotes. However, information leaking out on such preparations might lead to negative dynamic effects, like bank runs. Conversely, leaving the Eurozone, but retaining the Euro as de facto currency, would avoid the practical issues and relieve the country of the burden of its Eurozone responsibilities.\n\nIn the event of a new currency being introduced, all banks would close for several days to allow old (Euro) banknotes to be stamped to denote that they were now drachmas, and/or a newly printed currency to be distributed to bank branches for distribution to the public when banks reopened. The British money printing company De La Rue was, according to rumours on 18 May 2012, preparing to print new drachma notes based on old moulds, which De La Rue refused to comment. The typical time between an order for a new currency being placed and the delivery of the banknotes is about six months.\n\nIn July 2012, the Wolfson Economics Prize, a prize for the \"best proposal for a country to leave the European Monetary Union\", was awarded to a Capital Economics team led by Roger Bootle, for their submission titled \"Leaving the Euro: A Practical Guide.\" The winning proposal argued that a member wishing to exit should introduce a new currency and default on a large part of its debts. The net effect, the proposal claimed, would be positive for growth and prosperity. It also called for keeping the euro for small transactions and for a short period of time after the exit from the eurozone, along with a strict regime of inflation-targeting and tough fiscal rules monitored by \"independent experts\".\n\nThe Roger Bootle/Capital Economics plan also suggested that \"key officials\" should meet \"in secret\" one month before the exit is publicly announced, and that eurozone partners and international organisations should be informed \"three days before\". The judges of the Wolfson Economics Prize found that the winning plan was the \"most credible solution\" to the question of a member state leaving the eurozone.\n\nOn 29 May 2012 the National Bank of Greece (not to be confused with the central bank, the Bank of Greece) warned that \"[a]n exit from the euro would lead to a significant decline in the living standards of Greek citizens.\" According to the announcement, per capita income would fall by 55%, the new national currency would depreciate by 65% vis-à-vis the euro, and the recession would deepen to 22%. Furthermore, unemployment would rise from its current 22% to 34% of the work force, and inflation, which was then at 2%, would soar to 30%.\n\nAccording to the Greek think-tank Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research (IOBE), a new drachma would lose half or more of its value relative to the euro. This would drive up inflation, and reduce the purchasing power of the average Greek. At the same time, the country's economic output would drop, putting more people out of work where one in five is already unemployed. The prices of imported goods would skyrocket, putting them out of reach for many.\n\nAnalyst Vangelis Agapitos estimated that inflation under the new drachma would quickly reach 40 to 50 per cent to catch up with the fall in the new currency's value. To stop the falling value of the drachma, interest rates would have to be increased to as high as 30 to 40 per cent, according to Agapitos. People would then be unable to pay off their loans and mortgages and the country's banks would have to be nationalised to stop them from going under, he predicted.\n\nIOBE head of research Aggelos Tsakanikas foresaw an increase in crime as a consequence of a Grexit, as people struggled to pay bills. \"We won’t see tanks in the streets and violence, we won’t see people starving in the streets, but crime could very well rise\".\n\nThe centre-right New Democracy party has accused the leftist SYRIZA of supporting withdrawal from the euro. However, SYRIZA's leader, Alexis Tsipras, has stated that Greece should not leave the eurozone and return to the drachma because \"...we will have poor people, who have drachmas, and rich people, who will buy everything with euros.\" Past opinion polling had shown that generally most Greeks favored keeping the euro.\n\nOf all the political parties which won seats in the parliamentary election in May 2012, the Communist KKE expressed support for leaving both the euro and the European Union. However, its General Secretary, Dimitris Koutsoumpas, pondered: \"The exit from the EU and the euro will be hazardous, a blind alley unless it is combined with a concrete plan, a programme for the economy and society, with a new organization of society, i.e. a socialist society with the socialization of the concentrated means of production, unilateral cancelation of the debt, working class and people's power.\"\n\nGolden Dawn is also staunchly Eurosceptic, opposing Greece's participation in the European Union and the eurozone.\n\nOn 21 August 2015, 25 MPs from SYRIZA split from the party and formed Popular Unity, which fully supports leaving the euro. In the September 2015 Greek legislative election, the party won 2.8% of the popular vote, winning no seats.\n\nBoth the Greek government and the EU favour Greece staying within the Euro and believe this to be possible. However, some commentators believe an exit is likely. In February 2015, the former head of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said \"it is just a matter of time\" for Greece to withdraw from the eurozone, and former United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke described it as inevitable.\n\nA leaked document revealed that, during informal discussions with one of the European leaders, then UK Prime Minister David Cameron suggested that Greece might be better off if it exited the eurozone. British officials declined to make their comments on the leaked document.\n\nRichard Koo, chief economist for Nomura Research Institute, accused IMF and EU of basing their negotiation position on unrealistic assumptions. As Koo pointed out, IMF's argument was that if the austerity programme had been implemented as assumed, no further debt relief would have been needed under 2012's framework. The EU's argument was that Greece encountered a difficult situation in 2015 because it delayed implementation of structural reforms. Koo said that the argument was highly unrealistic because structural reforms do not work in a short run, adding that the US did not benefit from the Reaganomics structural reforms during Reagan's era. After publishing documents which admit that the southern European country needs debt relief and a moratorium on debt repayment for 30 years, the IMF was only \"slowly beginning to understand\" the Greek economy, said Koo.\n\nIn January 2015, speculation about a Greek exit from the eurozone was revived when , deputy leader of the center-right CDU/CSU faction in the German Bundestag, was quoted on 31 December 2014: \"The time when we had to rescue Greece is over. There is no more blackmail potential. Greece is not systemically relevant for the euro.\" A following article in the weekly Spiegel citing sources from Wolfgang Schäuble's ministry of finance further spurred these speculations. Both German and international media widely interpreted this as the Merkel government tacitly warning Greek voters from voting for SYRIZA in the upcoming legislative election of 25 January 2015.\n\nGermany's largest selling tabloid, the right-wing populist Bild, raised further anger when it compared Greece to an unfair footballer: \"What happens to a footballer who breaks the rules and does a crude foul? – He leaves the pitch. He is sent off as a punishment. No question.\"\n\nThe German government's interference in the January 2015 elections in Greece was strongly criticized by leaders of European Parliament groups including Socialists & Democrats (S&D), the liberal ALDE and the Greens/EFA group, when S&D president Gianni Pittella said, \"German right-wing forces trying to act like a sheriff in Greece or any other member states is not only unacceptable but above all wrong.\" It has also been criticized by the German opposition party The Greens', with its speaker Simone Peter calling the debate over a Grexit \"highly irresponsible\".\n\nEconomists of German Commerzbank said that preventing a Greek exit was still desirable for Germany, since a Greek exit would wipe out billions of euros in European taxpayer money, and \"it would be much easier politically to renegotiate a compromise with Greece, albeit a lame one, and thus maintain the fiction that Greece will pay back its loans at some point in time.\"\n\nFTSE \"considers Grexit following the election to be highly unlikely...\".\n\nOn 9 February, UK Prime Minister David Cameron chaired a meeting to discuss any possible ramifications in the event of an exit. According to a Bloomberg report George Osborne said at the meeting of the G-20 finance ministers in Istanbul: \"A Greek exit from the euro would be very difficult for the world economy and potentially very damaging for the European economy.\"\n\nIn February 2015, the Russian government stated that it would offer Greece aid but would only provide it in rubles.\n\nKathimerini reported that after 16 February Eurogroup talks Commerzbank AG increased the risk of Greece exiting the euro to 50%. The expression used by \"Time\" for these talks is \"Greece and the Euro Zone dance on the precipice\".\n\nAfter an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers (20 February 2015), European leaders agreed to extend Greece's bailout for further four months.\n\nBy late June 2015 negotiations on a deal had collapsed, and Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras called a referendum for 5 July on the revised proposals from the IMF and the EU, which he said that his government would campaign against. The referendum was defeated by a margin of 61% to 39%. Eurozone finance ministers have refused to extend the bailout.\n\nQuestioned on whether the referendum would be a euro-drachma dilemma, Greece's finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said that European Treaties make provisions for an exit from the EU but do not make any provisions for an exit from the Eurozone. A referendum as a choice involving exit from the Eurozone would violate EU Treaties and EU Law.\n\nClaudia Panseri, head of equity strategy at Société Générale, speculated in late May 2012 that eurozone stocks could plummet up to 50 percent in value if Greece makes a disorderly exit from the eurozone. Bond yields in other European nations could widen 1 percent point to 2 percent points, negatively affecting their ability to service their own sovereign debts.\n\nEurope in 2010 accounted for 25 percent of world trade, according to Deutsche Bank. Economic depression within the European economy would ripple worldwide and slow global growth. However, Greece represents just a small fraction—less than 2 per cent—of European gross domestic product (GDP).\n\nA working paper published by the European Central Bank concluded:\n\nIn the absence of any ruling by the European Court of Justice, the question of whether a country can unilaterally leave the Eurozone without leaving the EU is unclear. The Williams Stamps Farish Professor in Law at the University of Texas School of Law has suggested that under certain conditions, it is possible for a Member State to do so.\n\n\n"}

The performance took place in Los Angeles, California in 1977 as a response to the rapes and murders covered by the media in the \"Hillside Strangler\" case.\"As if the horror of these crimes wasn't enough, the press coverage of the events sensationalized the sexual nature of the crimes. For feminist activists in Los Angeles involved in the movement to end violence against women, this analysis was unacceptable.\"\n\nA continuation of \"Three Weeks in May,\" Lacy and Labowitz designed \"In Mourning and in Rage\" as a personal response to the sensationalized media coverage of violence against women as well as an expression of grief and rage towards the loss of life. The performance was a collaboration between Lacy, Labowitz, Bia Lowe, Holly Near, City Councilwoman Pat Russel, the Woman's Building, Women Against Violence Against Women, and Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. The event was staged for mass media coverage at the Los Angeles City Hall.\n\nThe performance consisted of a large funeral motorcade of black-clad women lead by a hearse from the Woman's Building to the Los Angeles City Hall. Once there, nine seven-feet-tall women draped in black emerged from the hearse along with a women dressed in red. The mourners then climbed the steps of city hall where each of the nine women gave a statement into a microphone expressing their solidarity with the murdered women, emphasized by a chorus of \"In memory of our sisters, we fight back!\" from the rest of the motorcade. By making this performance public as well as highly crafted for media coverage, Lacy and Labowitz looked to highlight not only the deaths of the ten women killed by the Hillside Strangler, but the significantly larger population of women victims whose stories went uncovered by mainstream media.\n\nThe piece concluded with direct statements to the press explaining the rationale for the piece as well as a speech demanding resources for women's self defense. Singer-songwriter Holly Near performed her song \"Fight Back\" which was written specifically for this event.\n\n\"In Mourning and in Rage\" was highly covered by the press and resulted in increased support from Los Angeles City Council members and a pledge from the Rape Hotline Alliance to provide self defense classes.\n\nTo further the conversation about social action and art, Lacy and Labowitz produced a video documenting \"In Mourning and in Rage\" as well as a pamphlet entitled \"What is Social Art?.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "7297625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7297625", "title": "Korean New Year", "text": "Korean New Year\n\nKorean New Year () is the first day of the Korean lunar calendar. It is one of the most important traditional Korean holidays. The celebration usually lasts three days: the day before Korean New Year, Korean New Year itself, and the day after Korean New Year. During this time, many Koreans visit family, perform ancestral rites, wear \"hanbok\" (Hangul: 한복; Hanja: 韓服), eat traditional food, and play folk games. Additionally, children often receive money from their elders after performing a formal bow.\n\nKorean New Year generally occurs in January or February on the second new moon after the winter solstice, unless there is a intercalary eleventh or twelfth month in the lead-up to the New Year. In such a case, the New Year falls on the third new moon after the solstice. Korean New Year typically falls on the same day as Chinese New Year.\n\nWhile Korean New Year is generally referred to as \"Seollal\", it has been called by many other names. They are listed in the table below.\nThe earliest references to Korean New Year are believed to be found in the 3rd century Chinese historical work, \"Records of the Three Kingdoms, Book of Wei, Volume 30.\" Records of 7th century Korean New Year celebrations are included in the Chinese historical works, the \"Book of Sui\" and the \"Old Book of Tang\". By the 13th century, Korean New Year was one of the nine major Korean festivals that included ancestral rites, according to the Korean historical work, the \"Goryeosa\". \n\nKorean New Year is typically a family holiday. The three-day holiday is used by many to return to their hometowns to visit their parents and other relatives, where they perform an ancestral ritual called \"charye\". The three days are the day of, the day before, and the after. In 2016, 36 million South Koreans reportedly would be traveling to visit their families during the Korean New Year. Koreans not only travel within the country, but around the world, as well. Many Koreans travel from overseas to visit their families for this annual holiday. Since it is one of the few times families may be able to get together and catch up on one another's lives, it is considered respectful and important to attend the holiday. Often, the family members first visit the elders, and this includes the grandparents and the parents. It is also considered respectful for people to visit their mothers- and fathers-in-law during the Korean New Year.\n\nIncluding travel expense, preparation for this holiday is very costly. Gifts are usually given to family members and new clothes are worn during the holiday. Traditional food is prepared for many family members coming to visit for the holiday. Fruits are especially expensive. Due to the increased demand, food prices are inflated during the month of Seollal. As a result, some people have chosen to forgo some traditions because they have become too expensive. These families prepare a modest ancestral rite only with necessary foods for Seollal. The government has started taking certain measures to help stabilize and support ordinary people's livelihood for Seollal holiday period. They have raised the supply of agricultural, fishery, and livestock products. The government used the rice reserves and pork imports to lower inflation. The government is also putting money into small and medium-sized companies to help with cash flow.\n\nMany preparations go into celebrating the Korean New Year. During the first morning, Koreans pay their respect towards their ancestors. Traditional foods are placed on a table as an offering to the ancestors, and a rite begins with deep bows from all family members. This is a sign of respect and a very important practice on the first day of the New Year in Korea. It is also where they pray for the well-being of all the family members. Many Koreans dress up in colorful traditional Korean clothing called \"hanbok\". Hanbok are usually worn for special occasions such as weddings, Korean New Year, child's first birthday, etc. However, with modernization and evolving mores in the culture, more people tend to prefer westernized, modern clothing to the hanbok. After the rite, the members have a big feast.\n\nAdditionally, Koreans follow a zodiac similar to the Chinese zodiac. Twelve (12) animals represent the 12 years in sequential order with the rat/mouse representing the first year. Buddha is believed to have invited animals from all over the world to visit, to which only 12 visited. In return, he honored them by naming the years in the order that they arrived. Koreans believe that specific zodiac animals bring specific resources and qualities. For example, the year 2014 was the year of the horse, and it was considered a good year in the money and career aspect of life. It is said that a person born in a specific zodiacal year will carry that zodiac animal's characteristics. As a result, Koreans plan their year and activities around it to have a good, prosperous year. Parents may have even planned the birth year of their child, so the child may have a specific characteristic. It is fair to say that the Korean zodiac is an important part of Korea's culture.\n\nAnother custom observed is the lighting of a \"moon house\" built from burnable firewood and branches. This symbolizes the warding off of bad/evil spirits for the new year. Many also choose to add wishes they want come true in the next year to the moon house.\n\nSebae (세배, 歲拜, \"worship elders\") is a ritual of filial piety that is traditionally observed on Seollal. Dressed in traditional clothing, children wish their elders (grandparents, parents and aunts and uncles) a happy new year by performing a deep traditional bow (rites with more than one bow involved are usually for the deceased) and the words \"saehae bok mani badeuseyo\" (Hangul: 새해 복 많이 받으세요), or \"Please receive a lot of good fortune for the New Year\". Elders typically reward this gesture by giving children new year's money, or \"pocket money\" (usually in the form of crisp paper money) in silk bags made with beautiful traditional designs, as well as offering words of wisdom (dŏkdam). Historically, parents gave out rice cakes \"(ddeok)\" and fruit to their children.\n\n\"Tteokguk\" (soup with sliced rice cakes) is a traditional Korean food that is customarily eaten for the New Year. According to Korean age reckoning, the Korean New Year is similar to a birthday for Koreans, and eating \"tteokguk\" is part of the birthday celebration. Once you finish eating your \"tteokguk\", you are one year older.\n\nOn Korean New Year day, people prepare a lot of food and spend much of the day with family.\n\n\"Jeon\", sometimes called \"buchimgae\", is a traditional Korean dish especially eaten on the Korean New Year's Day.

However, the \"jeon\" is ripped apart with chopsticks in the belief of making it taste better.\n\nMany traditional games are associated with the Korean New Year. The traditional family board game \"yutnori\" remains a popular game, especially during Korean New Year. It is played using a set of specially designed sticks and is considered appropriate for all ages and genders. Men and boys traditionally would also fly rectangle kites called \"Yeon\" (Hangul: 연, see \"yeonnalligi\"), and also play \"jegichagi\", a game in which a light object is wrapped in paper or cloth, and then kicked in a footbag like manner. Korean women and girls would have traditionally played \"neolttwigi\", a game of jumping on a seesaw (Hangul: 시소), and \"gongginori\", a game played with five little \"gonggi\" (originally a little stone, but today many buy manufactured \"gongi\" in toy shops>). Top (\"paengi\" ((Hangul: 팽이) in Korean) spinning is also a traditional game played by children. Recently, a few adults play Go-Stop instead of traditional hwatu.\n\n"}

The ship was suspected of being involved in smuggling about morphine base into Turkey. The crew scuttled the ship during the operation.\n\nMV \"Kısmetim-1\" was owned by Osman Ayanoğlu.\nThe morphine base on the ship, worth millions of dollars, belonged to a consortium of himself and his partners including Şeyhmus Daş and Hüseyin Baybaşin, all Turkish drug lords.\n\nMV \"Kısmetim-1\" departed on October 7, 1991 from the Port of Yarımca in İzmit, Turkey, carrying dyestuff to Karachi, Pakistan. As the ship docked at the destination port, Celal Kambur, the ship's purser started a conversation with the port policeman Yousuf Chacha. The Pakistani policeman asked the Turkish crew member to deliver a package to Ajman, a port in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The package contained heroin at a price of US$1.00 per gram.\n\nSoon after leaving the Port of Karachi, the captain received a radio message saying that the ship's owner Osman Ayanoğlu was ambushed and murdered. On the way to Port of Ajman before dawn, the captain ordered to pickup goods from a motorboat on high sea, which docked the ship. More than 100 sacks were pulled up into the ship in the darkness. The captain told the crew that the sacks contained nuclear material for the MKE\n\nThe ship arrived in Ajman to unload fertilizer. Celal Kambur met the Pakistani drug dealer and received the money in a restaurant. The delivery of the drug package took place at 23:00 local time the same day by throwing to a boat, which pulled alongside the ship.\n\nThe next morning, police raid the ship and found the money of US$10,000 from the drug trade on Celal Kambur. He was tried and found guilty for the drug crime. The ship moored at the port for six months during the trial and was only allowed to leave as the trial ended, and Celal Kambur was put into prison.\n\nCelal Kambur served his heavy prison sentence and was pardoned after nine years by the emir of Ajman, one of the seven emirates of the UAE federation.\n\nSince its departure from Karachi, the ship was under close surveillance by the United States DEA, which was forwarding all the relevant information to the Turkish Police. The incident in Ajman was very disappointing for the US and Turkish law enforcement services since they feared the main smuggle would have been revealed.\n\nFinally, the ship passed through the Suez Canal and sailed into the Mediterranean Sea. Three Turkish Navy warships, the frigate TCG \"Yıldırım\" (F 243), the destroyer TCG \"Savaştepe\" (D 348), the submarine rescue ship TCG \"Akın\" (A 585) and the US destroyer USS \"Briscoe\" (DD-977) carrying Turkish and US narcotic policemen as well as maritime patrol aircraft of type P-3 Orion deployed from Sicily intercepted the ship in high sea before she tried to escape to Cyprus, a country, which Turkey has no good international relations with. Following the four days lasting joint operation, the ship went down with all its load, the nine crew were rescued.\n\nThe US and Turkish officials claimed that the crew deliberately sank the ship in order to prevent the capture of the drug load. The ship's crew denied this allegation before the court declaring that the ship sank due to rough sea.\n\nThe operation was led on site by Necdet Menzir, director of Istanbul Police Department and Mestan Şener, head of the narcotics bureau. Mehmet Ağar, director general of the Turkish Police and Ismet Sezgin, minister of interior, were in command of the operation.\n\nŞeyhmus Daş was shot to death on December 25, 1992 in Istanbul in his car when he was on the way to a wedding ceremony along with his wife and two daughters. The killing occurred ten days after the Kısmetim-1 incident and two weeks before the Lucky-S incident, another drug smuggling operation on the sea.\n\nNejat Daş, son of Şeyhmus Daş, who had carried out the drug trade negotiations in Karachi on behalf of his father, was tried at the 2nd State Security Court (DGM) in Istanbul and found guilty of drug trafficking. He was charged with 5 years and 10 months of heavy prison sentence. He escaped the prison on November 8, 1994, as he was brought from Sinop Fortress Prison to the 1st DGM in Istanbul for trial due to his involvement in the Lucky-S incident.\n\nTurkish TV series Valley of the Wolves use this incident.\n\n"}

These art competitions were considered an integral part of the movement by International Olympic Committee (IOC) founder Pierre de Coubertin and necessary to recapture the complete essence of the Ancient Olympic Games. Their absence before the 1912 Summer Olympics, according to journalism professor Richard Stanton, stems from Coubertin \"not wanting to fragment the focus of his new and fragile movement\". Art competitions were originally planned for inclusion in the 1908 Summer Olympics but were delayed after that edition's change in venue from Rome to London following the 1906 eruption of Mount Vesuvius. By the 1924 Summer Olympics they had grown to be considered internationally relevant and potentially \"a milestone in advancing public awareness of art as a whole\".\n\nDuring their first three appearances, the art competitions were grouped into five broad categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. The Dutch Organizing Committee for the 1928 Summer Olympics split these into subcategories in the hopes of increasing participation. Although it was a successful strategy, the 1932 Summer Olympics eliminated several of these subcategories, which led to fewer entries in the broader categories. For the 1936 Summer Olympics, the German government proposed the addition of a film contest to the program, which was rejected.\n\nFollowing a final appearance at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions were removed from the Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions during the course of the Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.\n\nThe IOC does not track medalists in Olympic art competitions in its database and thus the prize winners are only officially recorded in the original Olympic reports. Judges were not required to distribute first, second, and third place awards for every category, and thus certain events lack medalists in these placements. Since participants were allowed multiple submissions, it was also possible for artists to win more than one in a single event, as Alex Diggelmann of Switzerland did in the graphic arts category of the 1948 edition. Diggelmann is tied with Denmark's Josef Petersen, who won second prize three times in literature, for the amount of medals captured in the art competitions. Luxembourg's Jean Jacoby is the only individual to win two gold medals, doing so in painting in 1924 and 1928. Of the 146 medalists, 11 were women and only Finnish author Aale Tynni was awarded gold. Germany was the most successful nation, with eight gold, seven silver, and nine bronze medals, although one was won by Coubertin himself, a Frenchman. He submitted his poem \"Ode to Sport\" under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, as if it were a joint-entry, and won first prize in the 1912 literature category. The original report credits this medal to Germany. Two individuals, Walter W. Winans and Alfréd Hajós, won medals in both athletic and art competitions.\n\n"}

On November 7, 1969, Cesnik disappeared. Her body was discovered on January 3, 1970, near a garbage dump in the Baltimore suburb of Lansdowne. Her murder remains unsolved. Cesnik's murder is the basis for the Netflix documentary web series \"The Keepers\" in 2017.\n\nCatherine Anne Cesnik was born on November 17, 1942, in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania neighborhood of Lawrenceville, located in the city's east end. She was the eldest child of Joseph and Anna Omulac Cesnik (died 2015). Her paternal grandparents, John (Jan) and Johanna Tomec Česnik, were Slovenians who emigrated from Yugoslavia to Pittsburgh, while her maternal grandfather, Joseph Omulac, came from Yugoslavia and maternal grandmother, Martha Hudok, was born in Austria. Cesnick had three siblings.\n\nCesnik attended St. Mary's School on 57th Street and St. Augustine High School, both in Lawrenceville. She was valedictorian of her Catholic high school class in 1960, where she had also been the May Queen and the president of the senior class and student council.\n\nAt the time she disappeared, Cesnik was teaching at Western High School in Baltimore, Maryland. On November 7, 1969, she left the apartment she shared with Sister Helen Russell Phillips at the Carriage House Apartments, at 131 North Bend Road in Catonsville, en route to the Edmondson Village Shopping Center to purchase a gift at Hecht's for her sister's engagement. Records indicate Cesnik cashed a paycheck at First National Bank in Catonsville that night and possibly made a purchase at Muhly's Bakery in Edmondson Village, since a box of bakery buns was found in the front seat of Cesnik's car. The car, in muddy condition, was found illegally parked across from her apartment complex at 4:40 the next morning by Russell's friends, the priests Peter McKeon and Gerard J. Koob. Residents of Carriage House Apartments spotted Cesnik in her car at approximately 8:30 that night, and others spotted her car at the illegally parked location across the street around two hours later.\n\nPolice searched the area immediately following Cesnik's disappearance but did not find her. On January 3, 1970, her body was found by a hunter and his son, in an informal landfill located on the 2100 block of Monumental Road, in a remote area of Lansdowne. An autopsy performed by Deputy Medical Examiner Werner Spitz revealed that Cesnik died from an intracerebral hemorrhage following a fracture to her skull from a blow to her left temple by a blunt instrument. The case remains unsolved .\n\nDuring Cesnik's tenure at Archbishop Keough High School, it is alleged that two of the priests, Fathers Joseph Maskell and E. Neil Magnus, were sexually abusing the girls at the school in addition to trafficking them to others. \nIn 1995, Teresa Lancaster and Jean Wehner (née Hargadon), former students at Keough who claim to have been sexually abused by Maskell, filed a lawsuit against the school which was dismissed under the statute of limitations (\"Jane Doe et al. v. A. Joseph Maskell et al.\"). Wehner said that Cesnik once came to her and said gently, \"Are the priests hurting you?\" Both women have said that she is the only one who helped them and other girls abused by Maskell, \"et al.\", and have said that she was murdered prior to discussing the matter with the Archdiocese of Baltimore, although there is no evidence for this assertion.\n\nThere is currently no physical evidence linking Maskell to the crime. It was revealed in late 2016 that the Archdiocese had paid off numerous settlements to Maskell's alleged victims since 2011.\n\nWehner alleges that, two months before Cesnik's body was discovered, and only a day or two after Cesnik disappeared on November 7, Maskell drove her to a wooded site near Fort Meade and showed her the body. Wehner claims to remember trying repeatedly to brush off the maggots crawling on Cesnik's face while frantically repeating the words, \"Help me, help me.\" Wehner's account was brought into question by scientific evidence showing that it would have been impossible for maggots to be alive at the relevant time of year. However, pathologist Werner Spitz, who worked on the case, later confirmed that there had been maggots in both the victim's mouth and trachea when found. Meteorological records also disclose that the temperature the week in question was high enough for maggots to hatch. It is alleged that Maskell reportedly told Wehner, \"You see what happens when you say bad things about people?\"\n\nSeveral days later, on November 13, the body of Joyce Malecki, a 20-year-old woman who looked like Wehner, was discovered by \"two hunters\" in the same wooded location where Maskell had driven Wehner to see Cesnik's body. Cesnik's body was not found until January 3, 1970, and its discovery by \"two hunters\" was not in the wooded location near Fort Meade but on the open hill trash dump of a small business property in Lansdowne.\n\nIn 2016, the Baltimore County Police Department (BCPD) reassigned the case due to retiring officers, prompting new interviews and further investigation into the alleged sexual abuse at Keough. After attaining permission from the State's attorney's office, the BCPD exhumed the body of Maskell, who died of a major stroke in 2001, but did not find a DNA match to evidence from the crime scene. Police spokeswoman Elise Armacost announced that this discovery does not exclude Maskell from being a suspect in the case.\n\nNetflix produced a seven-part documentary series about the case called \"The Keepers\", which debuted on May 19, 2017. The series features interviews with women who were Cesnik's students, and with some of those who were sexually abused by Maskell and others.\n\n"}

{"id": "865346", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=865346", "title": "Ottoman wars in Europe", "text": "Ottoman wars in Europe\n\nThe Ottoman wars in Europe were a series of military conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and various European states dating from the Late Middle Ages up through the early 20th century. The earliest conflicts began during the Byzantine–Ottoman wars, waged in Anatolia in the late 13th century before entering Europe in the mid 14th century, followed by the Bulgarian–Ottoman wars and the Serbian–Ottoman wars waged beginning in the mid 14th century. Much of this period was characterized by Ottoman expansion into the Balkans. The Ottoman Empire made further inroads into Central Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries, culminating in the peak of Ottoman territorial claims in Europe. \n\nThe Ottoman–Venetian Wars spanned four centuries, starting in 1423 and lasting until 1718. This period witnessed the fall of Negroponte in 1470, the fall of Famagusta (Cyprus) in 1571, the defeat of the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 (at that time the largest naval battle in history), the fall of Candia (Crete) in 1669, the Venetian reconquest of Morea (Peloponnese) in the 1680s and its loss again in 1715. The island of Corfu under Venetian rule remained the only Greek island not conquered by the Ottomans.\n\nIn the late seventeenth century, European powers began to consolidate against the Ottomans and formed the Holy League, reversing a number of Ottoman land gains during the Great Turkish War of 1683–99. Nevertheless, Ottoman armies were able to hold their own against their European rivals until the second half of the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century the Ottomans were confronted with insurrection from their Serbian (1804–1817) and Greek (1821–1832) subjects. This occurred in tandem with the Russo-Turkish wars, which further destabilized the empire. The final retreat of Ottoman rule came with the First Balkan War (1912–1913), followed by the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres at the close of World War I.\n\nAfter striking a blow to the weakened Byzantine Empire in 1356 (or in 1358 - disputable due to a change in the Byzantine calendar), (see Süleyman Pasha) which provided it with Gallipoli as a basis for operations in Europe, the Ottoman Empire started its westward expansion into the European continent in the middle of the 14th century.\n\nConstantinople fell in 1453 after the Battle of Varna (1444) and the Second Battle of Kosovo (1448).\n\nThe remaining Greek states fell in 1461 (Despotate of the Morea and Empire of Trebizond) (see: Ottoman Greece).\n\nIn the latter half of the 14th century, the Ottoman Empire proceeded to advance north and west in the Balkans, completely subordinating Thrace and much of Macedonia after the Battle of Maritsa in 1371. Sofia fell in 1382, followed by the capital of the Second Bulgarian Empire Tarnovgrad in 1393, and the northwest remnants of the state after the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396.\n\nA significant opponent of the Ottomans, the young Serbian Empire, was worn down by a series of campaigns, notably in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, in which the leaders of both armies were killed, and which gained a central role in Serbian folklore as an epic battle and as the beginning of the end for medieval Serbia. Much of Serbia fell to the Ottomans by 1459, the Kingdom of Hungary made a partial reconquest in 1480, but it fell again by 1499. Territories of Serbian Empire were divided between Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Venice and Royal Hungary, with remaining territories being in some sort of a vassal status towards Hungary, until its own conquest.\n\nThe defeat in 1456 at the Siege of Nándorfehérvár (Belgrade) held up Ottoman expansion into Catholic Europe for 70 years, though for one year (1480–1481) the Italian port of Otranto was taken, and in 1493 the Ottoman army successfully raided Croatia and Styria.\n\nThe Ottomans took much of Albania in the 1385 Battle of Savra. The 1444 League of Lezhë briefly restored one part of Albania, until Ottomans captured complete territory of Albania after capture of Shkodër in 1479 and Durrës in 1501.\n\nThe Ottomans faced the fiercest resistance from Albanians who gathered around their leader, George Castriot, son of a feudal nobleman, and managed to fend off Ottoman attacks for more than 25 years, culminating at the siege of Shkodra in 1478–79. It has been argued that Albanian resilience halted the Ottoman advance along the Eastern flank of the Western Civilization, saving the Italian peninsula from Ottoman conquest. Sultan Mehmet II died in 1481, merely two years after the collapse of the Albanian resistance and one year after he launched an Italian campaign.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire first reached Bosnia in 1388 where they were defeated by Bosnian forces in the Battle of Bileća and then was forced to retreat. After the fall of Serbia in 1389 Battle of Kosovo, where the Bosnians participated through Vlatko Vuković, the Turks began various offensives against the Kingdom of Bosnia. The Bosnians defended themselves but without much success. The Bosnians resisted strongly in the Bosnian Royal castle of Jajce (the siege of Jajce), where the last Bosnian king Stjepan Tomašević tried to repel the Turks. The Ottoman army conquered Jajce after a few months in 1463 and executed the last King of Bosnia, ending Medieval Bosnia.\n\nThe House of Kosača held Herzegovina until 1482.\n\nAfter the fall of the Kingdom of Bosnia into Ottoman hands in 1463, the southern and central parts of the Kingdom of Croatia remained unprotected, the defense of which was left to Croatian gentry who kept smaller troops in the fortified border areas at their own expense. The Ottomans meanwhile reached the river Neretva and, having conquered Herzegovina (Rama) in 1482, they encroached upon Croatia, skillfully avoiding the fortified border towns. A decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Krbava Field shook all of Croatia. However, it did not dissuade the Croats from making persistent attempts at defending themselves against the attacks of the superior Ottoman forces. After almost two hundred years of Croatian resistance against the Ottoman Empire, victory in the Battle of Sisak marked the end of Ottoman rule and the Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War. The Viceroy's army, chasing the fleeing remnants at Petrinja in 1595, sealed the victory.\n\nThe Kingdom of Hungary, which at the time spanned the area from Croatia in the west to Transylvania in the east, was also gravely threatened by Ottoman advances. The origins of such a deterioration can be traced back to the fall of the Árpád ruling dynasty and their subsequent replacement with the Angevin and Jagiellonian kings. After a series of inconclusive wars over the course of 176 years, the kingdom finally crumbled in the Battle of Mohács of 1526, after which most of it was either conquered or brought under Ottoman suzerainty. (The \"150-year Turkish Occupation\", as it is called in Hungary, lasted until the late 17th century but parts of the Hungarian Kingdom were under Ottoman rule from 1421 and until 1718.)\n\nAs a result of heavy losses inflicted by the Ottomans in the Battle of Maritsa in 1371, the Serbian Empire had dissolved into several principalities. In the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, Serbian forces were again annihilated. Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, constant struggles took place between various Serbian kingdoms and the Ottoman Empire. The turning point was the fall of Constantinople to the Turks. In 1459, following the siege, the temporary Serbian capital of Smederevo fell. Zeta was overrun by 1499. Belgrade was the last major Balkan city to endure Ottoman forces. Serbs, Hungarians, and European crusaders defeated the Turkish army in the Siege of Belgrade in 1456. After repelling Ottoman attacks for over 70 years, Belgrade finally fell in 1521, along with the greater part of the Kingdom of Hungary. The Vojvodina rebellion between 1526 and 1528 led to the proclamation of the Second Serbian Empire in Vojvodina, which was among the last Serbian territories to resist the Ottomans. The Serbian Despotate fell in 1459, thus marking the two-century-long Ottoman conquest of Serbian principalities.\n\nThe wars with the Republic of Venice began in 1463. A favorable peace treaty was signed in 1479 after the lengthy siege of Shkodra (1478–79). In 1480, now no longer hampered by the Venetian fleet, the Ottomans besieged Rhodes and captured Otranto. War with Venice resumed from 1499 to 1503. In 1500, a Spanish–Venetian army commanded by Gonzalo de Córdoba took Kefalonia, temporarily stopping the Ottoman offensive on eastern Venetian territories. The offensive resumed after the Ottoman victory of Preveza, fought between an Ottoman fleet and that of a Christian alliance assembled by Pope Paul III in 1538.\n\nIn 1462, Mehmed II was driven back by Wallachian prince Vlad III Dracula in the Night Attack at Târgovişte. However, the latter was imprisoned by Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus. This caused outrage among many influential Hungarian figures and Western admirers of Vlad's success in the battle against the Ottoman Empire (and his early recognition of the threat it posed), including high-ranking members of the Vatican. Because of this, Matthias granted him the status of distinguished prisoner. Eventually, Dracula was freed in late 1475 and was sent with an army of Hungarian and Serbian soldiers to recover Bosnia from the Ottomans. There he defeated Ottoman forces for the first time. Upon this victory, Ottoman forces entered Wallachia in 1476 under the command of Mehmed II. Vlad was killed and, according to some sources, his head was sent to Constantinople to discourage the other rebellions. (Bosnia was completely added to Ottoman lands in 1482.)\n\nThe Turkish advance was temporarily halted after Stephen the Great of Moldavia defeated the armies of the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II at the Battle of Vaslui in 1475, one of the greatest defeats of the Ottoman Empire until that time. Stephen was defeated the next year at Războieni (Battle of Valea Albă), but the Ottomans had to retreat after they failed to take any significant castle (see Siege of Neamț Citadel) as a plague started to spread in the Ottoman army. Stephen's search for European assistance against the Turks met with little success, even though he had \"cut off the pagan's right-hand\", as he put it in a letter.\n\nAfter the Ottoman victory in the Battle of Mohács in 1526, only the southwestern part of the Kingdom of Hungary was actually conquered. The Ottoman campaign continued between 1526 and 1556 with small campaigns and major summer invasions – troops would return south of the Balkan Mountains before winter. In 1529, they mounted their first major attack on the Austrian Habsburg Monarchy, attempting to conquer the city of Vienna (Siege of Vienna). In 1532, another attack on Vienna with 60,000 troops in the main army was held up by the small fort (800 defenders) of \"Kőszeg\" in western Hungary, fighting a suicidal battle. The invading troops were held up until winter was close and the Habsburg Empire had assembled a force of 80,000 at Vienna. The Ottoman troops returned home through Styria, laying waste to the country.\n\nIn the meantime, in 1538, the Ottoman Empire invaded Moldavia. In 1541, another campaign in Hungary took Buda and Pest (which today together form the Hungarian capital Budapest) with a largely bloodless trick: after concluding peace talks with an agreement, troops stormed the open gates of Buda in the night. In retaliation for a failed Austrian counter-attack in 1542, the conquest of the western half of central Hungary was finished in the 1543 campaign that took both the most important royal ex-capital, Székesfehérvár, and the ex-seat of the cardinal, Esztergom. However, the army of 35–40,000 men was not enough for Suleiman to mount another attack on Vienna. A temporary truce was signed between the Habsburg and Ottoman Empires in 1547, which was soon disregarded by the Habsburgs.\n\nIn the major but moderately successful campaign of 1552, two armies took the eastern part of central Hungary, pushing the borders of the Ottoman Empire to the second (inner) line of northern \"végvár\"s (border castles), which Hungary originally built as defence against an expected second Mongol invasion—hence, afterwards, borders on this front changed little. For Hungarians, the 1552 campaign was a series of tragic losses and some heroic (but pyrrhic) victories, which entered folklore—most notably the fall of \"Drégely\" (a small fort defended to the last man by just 146 men), and the Siege of Eger. The latter was a major \"végvár\" with more than 2,000 men, without outside help. They faced two Ottoman armies, which were surprisingly unable to take the castle within five weeks. (The fort was later taken in 1596.) Finally, the 1556 campaign secured Ottoman influence over Transylvania (which had fallen under Habsburg control for a time), while failing to gain any ground on the western front, being tied down in the second (after 1555) unsuccessful siege of the southwestern Hungarian border castle of Szigetvár.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire conducted another major war against the Habsburgs and their Hungarian territories between 1566 and 1568. The 1566 Siege of Szigetvár, the third siege in which the fort was finally taken, but the aged Sultan died, deterring that year's push for Vienna.\n\nOttoman forces invaded and captured the island of Rhodes in 1522, after two previous failed attempts (see Siege of Rhodes). The Knights of Rhodes were banished to Malta, which was in turn besieged in 1565.\n\nAfter a siege of three months, the Ottoman army failed to control all of the Maltese forts. Delaying the Ottomans until bad weather conditions and the arrival of Sicilian reinforcements, made Ottoman commander Kızılahmedli Mustafa Pasha quit the siege. Around 22,000 to 48,000 Ottoman troops against 6,000 to 8,500 Maltese troops, the Ottomans failed to conquer Malta, sustaining about 10,000 losses, including one of the greatest Muslim corsair generals of the time, Dragut, and were repulsed. Had Malta fallen, Sicily and mainland Italy could have fallen under the threat of an Ottoman invasion. The victory of Malta during this event, which is nowadays known as the Great Siege of Malta, turned the tide and gave Europe hopes and motivation. It also marked the importance of the Knights of Saint John and their relevant presence in Malta to aid Christendom in its defence against the Muslim conquest.\n\nThe Ottoman naval victories of this period were in the Battle of Preveza (1538) and the Battle of Djerba (1560).\n\nThe Mediterranean campaign, which lasted from 1570 to 1573, resulted in the Ottoman conquest of Cyprus. A Holy League of Venice, the Papal States, Spain, the Knights of Saint John in Malta and initially Portugal was formed against the Ottoman Empire during this period. The League's victory in the Battle of Lepanto (1571) briefly ended Ottoman predominance at sea.\n\nIn the summer of 1570, the Turks struck again, but this time with a full-scale invasion rather than a raid. About 60,000 troops, including cavalry and artillery, under the command of Lala Mustafa Pasha landed unopposed near Limassol on July 2, 1570, and laid siege to Nicosia. In an orgy of victory on the day that the city fell—September 9, every public building and palace was looted. Word of the superior Ottoman numbers spread, and a few days later Mustafa took Kyrenia without having to fire a shot. Famagusta, however, resisted and put up a defense that lasted from September 1570 until August 1571.\n\nThe fall of Famagusta marked the beginning of the Ottoman period in Cyprus. Two months later, the naval forces of the Holy League, composed mainly of Venetian, Spanish, and Papal ships under the command of Don John of Austria, defeated the Ottoman fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in one of the decisive battles of world history. The victory over the Turks, however, came too late to help Cyprus, and the island remained under Ottoman rule for the next three centuries.\n\nIn 1570, the Ottoman Empire first conquered Cyprus, and Lala Mustafa Pasha became the first Ottoman governor of Cyprus, challenging the claims of Venice. Simultaneously, the Pope formed a coalition between the Papal States, Malta, Spain, Venice and several other Italian states, with no real result. In 1573 the Venetians left, removing the influence of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\n\nWas fought over Moldavia. The Polish army advanced into Moldavia and was defeated in the Battle of Ţuţora. The Next year, the Poles repelled the Turkish invasion in the Battle of Khotyn. Another conflict started in 1633 but was soon settled.\n\nTransylvania, the Eastern part of the former Hungarian Kingdom, gained semi-independence in 1526, while paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire. In 1657, Transylvania felt strong enough to attack the Tatars to the East (then the Empire's vassals), and later the Ottoman Empire itself, which had come to the Tatars' defence. The war lasted until 1662, ending in defeat for the Hungarians. The Western part of the Hungarian Kingdom (\"Partium\") was annexed and placed under direct Ottoman control. At the same time, there was another campaign against Austria between 1663 and 1664. Despite being defeated in the Battle of Saint Gotthard on 1 August 1664 by Raimondo Montecuccoli, the Ottomans secured recognition of their conquest of Nové Zámky in the Peace of Vasvár with Austria, marking the greatest territorial extent of Ottoman rule in the former Hungarian Kingdom.\n\nThe Polish–Ottoman War (1672–1676) ended with the Treaty of Żurawno, in which the Commonwealth ceded control of most of its Ukrainian territories to the empire.\n\nThe Great Turkish War started in 1683, with a grand invasion force of 140,000 men marching on Vienna, supported by Protestant Hungarian noblemen rebelling against Habsburg rule. To stop the invasion, another Holy League was formed, composed of Austria and Poland (notably in the Battle of Vienna), Venetians and the Russian Empire. After winning the Battle of Vienna, the Holy League gained the upper hand and reconquered Hungary (Buda and Pest were retaken in 1686, the former under the command of a Swiss-born convert to Islam). At the same time, the Venetians launched an expedition into Greece, which conquered the Peloponnese. During the 1687 Venetian attack on the city of Athens (conquered by the Ottomans), the Ottomans turned the ancient Parthenon into an ammunitions storehouse. A Venetian mortar hit the Parthenon, detonating the Ottoman gunpowder stored inside and partially destroying it.\n\nThe war ended with the Treaty of Karlowitz in 1699. Prince Eugene of Savoy first distinguished himself in 1683 and remained the most important Austrian commander until 1718.\n\nThe second Russo-Turkish War took place 1710–1711 near Prut. It was instigated by Charles XII of Sweden after the defeat at the Battle of Poltava, in order to tie down Russia with the Ottoman Empire and gain some breathing space in the increasingly unsuccessful Great Northern War. The Russians were severely beaten but not annihilated, and after the Treaty of Prut was signed the Ottoman Empire disengaged, allowing Russia to refocus its energies on the defeat of Sweden.\n\nThe Ottoman–Venetian War started in 1714. It overlapped with the Austro-Turkish War (1716–1718), in which Austria conquered the remaining areas of the former Hungarian Kingdom, ending with the Treaty of Passarowitz in 1718.\n\nAnother war with Russia started in 1735. The Austrians joined in 1737; the war ended in 1739 with the Treaty of Belgrade (with Austria) and the Treaty of Niš (with Russia).\n\nThe fourth Russo-Turkish War started in 1768 and ended in 1774 with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarcai.\n\nAnother war with Russia started in 1787 and a concurrent war with Austria followed in 1788; the Austrian war ended with the 1791 Treaty of Sistova, and the Russian war ended with the 1792 Treaty of Jassy.\n\nAn invasion of Egypt and Syria by Napoleon I of France took place in 1798–99, but ended due to British intervention.\n\nNapoleon's capture of Malta on his way to Egypt resulted in the unusual alliance of Russia and the Ottomans resulting in a joint naval expedition to the Ionian Islands. Their successful capture of these islands led to the setting up of the Septinsular Republic.\n\nThe First Serbian Uprising took place in 1804, followed by the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815; Serbia was fully liberated by 1867. Officially recognized independence followed in 1878.\n\nThe sixth Russo-Turkish War began in 1806 and ended in May 1812, just 13 days before Napoleon's invasion of Russia.\n\nMoldavian–Wallachian (Romanian) Uprising (starting simultaneously with the Greek Revolution).\n\nThe Greek War of Independence, taking place from 1821 to 1832, in which the Great Powers intervened from 1827, including Russia (seventh Russo–Turkish war, 1828–1829), achieved independence for Greece; the Treaty of Adrianople ended the war.\n\nBosnian rebellions 1831–1836, 1836–1837, 1841.\n\nAlbanian rebellions 1820–1822, 1830–1835, 1847.\n\nWar with Montenegro 1852–1853.\n\nEight Russo-Turkish war 1853–1856, Crimean War, in which the United Kingdom and France joined the war on the side of the Ottoman Empire. Ended with the Treaty of Paris.\n\nSecond war with Montenegro in 1858–1859.\n\nWar with Montenegro, Bosnia and Serbia in 1862.\n\nCretan Uprising in 1866.\n\nBulgarian Rebellion in 1876.\n\nThe ninth and final Russo-Turkish War started in 1877, the same year the Ottomans withdrew from the Constantinople Conference. Romania then declared its independence and waged war on Turkey, joined by Serbians and Bulgarians and finally the Russians (see also History of Russia (1855–92)). Austria occupied Bosnia in 1878. The Russians and the Ottomans signed the Treaty of San Stefano in early 1878. After deliberations at the Congress of Berlin, which was attended by all the Great Powers of the time, the Treaty of Berlin (1878) recognized several territorial changes.\n\nEastern Rumelia was granted some autonomy in 1878, rebelled and joined Bulgaria in 1885. Thessaly ceded to Greece in 1881, but after Greece attacked the Ottoman Empire to help the Second Cretan Uprising in 1897, Greece was defeated in Thessaly.\n\nIn 1911, Italy invaded Ottoman Tripolitania (During the decolonisation of Africa, Tripolitania became Libya), which was controlled by the Ottoman Empire. The war ended with the annexation of the Tripolitania.\n\nBulgarian insurrection from 1903. See Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising.\n\nTwo Balkan Wars, in 1912 and 1913, involved further action against the Ottoman Empire in Europe. The Balkan League first conquered Macedonia and most of Thrace from the Ottoman Empire, and then fell out over the division of the spoils. Albania declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912, after several rebellions and uprisings. This reduced Turkey's possessions in Europe (Rumelia) to their present borders in Eastern Thrace.\n\nWorld War I (1914–1918) became the ultimate cause of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which formally ended in 1922. However, during wartime operations the Empire prevented the British Royal Navy from reaching Constantinople, stopping an Entente invasion in the Battle of Gallipoli (1915–1916). Nevertheless, under the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne (1923) the Empire ultimately fell.\n\n\n"}

It was a triumph for Émile Levassor who arrived first after completing the 1,178 km race in 48 hours, nearly six hours ahead of the runner-up. However, the official winner was Paul Koechlin, who arrived third in his Peugeot, exactly 11 hours slower than Levassor, but officially the race had been for four-seater cars, whereas Levassor and the runner-up drove two-seater cars.\n\nParis–Bordeaux–Paris is sometimes called the first automobile race in history or the \"first motor race\". The 1894 Paris–Rouen had been run over public roads as a contest (\"concours\") not a race, and the fastest finisher, a steam powered vehicle, was judged ineligible for the main prize. Émile Levassor finished first in the 1,178 km Paris–Bordeaux–Paris race, taking 48 hours and 48 minutes, nearly six hours before the runner-up Louis Rigoulot, and eleven hours before the official winner, Paul Koechlin in his Peugeot. Officially, the race was for four-seater cars, and Levassor and Rigoulot drove two-seater cars. The ensuing outcry caused the \"A.C.F.\" to organise their next event, the 1896 Paris–Marseille–Paris, so that the fastest finisher was the winner.\n\nThe race is sometimes referred to as the \"I Grand Prix de l'A.C.F\". This results from a retrospective political move that began in the early 1920s when French media represented many races held in France before the 1906 French Grand Prix as being Grands Prix de l'Automobile Club de France, despite their running pre-dating the formation of the Club. Hence, the 1906 race was said to have been the 9th edition of the Grand Prix de l'Automobile Club de France. The ACF itself adopted this reasoning in 1933, although some members of the Club dismissed it, \"concerned the name of the Club was lent to the fiction simply out of a childish desire to establish their Grand Prix as the oldest race in the world.\"\n\nLevassor, who drove one of his cars, a 1205 cc (74 ci) Panhard & Levassor, started carefully, observing his opponents; he overtook the then leading Marquis de Dion who stopped to take on water for his steam car. Levassor led the race since then, stopping regularly to check his car's components. He came to Bordeaux several hours before any driver was expected to come which resulted in the fact that he had to drive back to Paris as well (the driver who was his change was still asleep in a hotel, and no-one knew which one). Levassor accepted the situation calmly, waking the organisers up to prove his coming and his time, had some sandwiches and champagne, took a brief walk and set off for Paris at 2:30 am. When Baron René de Knyff met him en route, he was so surprised by Levassor's time that he nearly crashed. Levassor, after spending two days and nights behind the wheel, came triumphantly to Paris, reaching an average speed of 24.5 km/h. He said after the race: \"Some 50 km before Paris I had a rather luxurious snack in a restaurant which helped me. But I feel a little tired.\"\n\nThe race proved that both the riders and the cars were capable of driving such distances and it generated public enthusiasm which indicated that such events were commercially viable.\n\nThe overall results were:\nEntrants who did not finish :\nEntrants in order of departure:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1327328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1327328", "title": "Rain (Beatles song)", "text": "Rain (Beatles song)\n\n\"Rain\" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was first released in May 1966 as the B-side of their \"Paperback Writer\" single. Both songs were recorded during the sessions for the album \"Revolver\" although neither appears on that album. The song was written by John Lennon and credited to Lennon–McCartney. It is noted for its slowed-down rhythm track, an example of the tape-manipulation techniques the band embraced at this time, and backwards vocals over the song's coda. The single's release marked the first time that reversed sounds had appeared in a pop song, although the Beatles used the same technique on the \"Revolver\" track \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", released in August 1966.\n\nThree promotional films were made for the song \"Rain\". \n\nThe inspiration for \"Rain\" is agreed on by Neil Aspinall, the Beatles' roadie, and John Lennon. They both described the band's arrival in Sydney, Australia, marked by rain and poor weather. Lennon said, \"I've never seen rain as hard as that, except in Tahiti\", and later explained that \"Rain\" was \"about people moaning about the weather all the time\". Another interpretation is that the song's \"rain\" and \"sun\" are phenomena experienced during a benign LSD trip.\n\n\"Rain\" has a simple musical structure. Set in the key of G major (the final mix pitches it about a quarter of a semitone below this, while the backing track was taped in G sharp), it begins with what Alan W. Pollack calls, \"a ra-ta-tat half-measure's fanfare of solo snare drums\", followed by a guitar intro of the first chord. The verses are nine measures long, and the song is in time. Each verse is based on the G, C, and D chords (I, IV, and V). The refrain contains only I and IV chords, and is twelve measures long (the repetition of a six-measure pattern). The first two measures are the G chord. The third and fourth measures are the C chord. The third measure has the C chord in the so-called (second) inversion. The fifth and sixth measures return to the G chord. Pollack says the refrain seems slower than the verse, though it is at the same tempo, an illusion achieved by \"the change of beat for the first four measures from its erstwhile bounce to something more plodding and regular\". After four verses and two refrains, a short solo for guitar and drums is played, with complete silence for one beat. Following this, the music returns accompanied by what Pollack terms \"historically significant\" reverse lyrics. Musicologist Walter Everett cites this closing section as an example of how the Beatles pioneered the \"fade-out–fade-in coda\", a device used again by them on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Helter Skelter\", and by Led Zeppelin on \"Thank You\".\n\nAllan Kozinn describes McCartney's bass as \"an ingenious counterpoint that takes him all over the fretboard ... while Lennon and McCartney harmonize in fourths on a melody with a slightly Middle Eastern tinge, McCartney first points up the song's droning character by hammering on a high G (approached with a quick slide from the F natural just below it), playing it steadily on the beat for twenty successive beats.\"\n\nRecording began on 14 April 1966, in the same session as \"Paperback Writer\", and concluded on 16 April, with a series of overdubs before mixing on the same day. At that time, the Beatles were enthusiastic about experimenting in the studio to achieve new sounds and effects. These experiments were showcased in their seventh album, \"Revolver\". Geoff Emerick, who was the engineer for both sessions, described one technique he used to alter the sonic texture of the track by recording the backing track \"faster than normal\". When played back, slightly slower than the usual speed, \"the music had a radically different tonal quality.\" The opposite technique was used to alter the tone of Lennon's lead vocal: it was recorded with the tape machine slowed down, making Lennon's voice sound higher when played back.\n\nThe last verse of \"Rain\" includes backwards vocals, the first use of this technique on a record. (the hit novelty song \"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!\n\", where side B is side A played backwards, was released later that year of 1966). The backwards vocals are Lennon singing the lyrics of the song: \"When the sun shines\", \"Rain\", and \"If the rain comes, they run and hide their heads.\" Both Lennon and producer George Martin claimed credit for the idea. Lennon said:\nAfter we'd done the session on that particular song – it ended at about four or five in the morning – I went home with a tape to see what else you could do with it. And I was sort of very stoned and tired, you know, not knowing what I was doing, and I just happened to put it on my own tape recorder and it came out backwards. And I liked it better. So that's how it happened.\nEmerick confirmed Lennon's creative accident, but Martin remembered it differently:\nI was always playing around with tapes and I thought it might be fun to do something extra with John's voice. So I lifted a bit of his main vocal off the four-track, put it on another spool, turned it around and then slid it back and forth until it fitted. John was out at the time but when he came back he was amazed.\nLater, in 1980, Lennon claimed:\nI got home from the studio and I was stoned out of my mind on marijuana and, as I usually do, I listened to what I'd recorded that day. Somehow I got it on backwards and I sat there, transfixed, with the earphones on, with a big hash joint. I ran in the next day and said, 'I know what to do with it, I know ... Listen to this!' So I made them all play it backwards. The fade is me actually singing backwards with the guitars going backwards. [Singing backwards] Sharethsmnowthsmeaness ... [Laughter] That one was the gift of God, of Jah, actually, the god of marijuana, right? So Jah gave me that one.\nRegardless of who is credited for the technique, \"from that point on,\" Emerick wrote, \"almost every overdub we did on \"Revolver\" had to be tried backwards as well as forwards.\"\n\nThe \"Paperback Writer\" / \"Rain\" single was the first release to use a new device invented by the maintenance department at Abbey Road called \"ATOC\" for \"Automatic Transient Overload Control\". The new device allowed the record to be cut at a louder volume, louder than any other single up to that time. On the final mix of the single, Lennon played a 1965 Gretsch Nashville, Paul McCartney a 1964 Rickenbacker 4001S bass, Harrison a 1964 Gibson SG, and Ringo Starr used Ludwig drums.\n\nFirst released as a B-side to \"Paperback Writer\" in the United States (Capitol 5651) on 30 May 1966 and in the UK on 10 June, the single was later released part of a Record Store Day reissue in 2010. It later appeared on the compilations \"Hey Jude\" in the US and \"Rarities\" in the UK. It also appeared on the \"Past Masters\" CD.\n\nIn the United States, the song peaked at number 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on 9 July 1966, and remained in that position the following week. The \"Paperback Writer\" single reached number 1 in the UK (for two weeks starting on 23 June). \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranks \"Rain\" 463rd in its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". On a similar list compiled by the New York radio station Q104.3, the song appeared at number 382.\n\n\"Rain\" is notable for Ringo Starr's drumming, which Starr rates as his best recorded performance. Both Ian MacDonald and \"Rolling Stone\" described his drumming on the track as \"superb\", while Richie Unterberger of AllMusic praised his \"creative drum breaks\". In 1984, Starr said: \"I think it's the best out of all the records I've ever made. 'Rain' blows me away … I know me and I know my playing … and then there's 'Rain'.\" \n\nMusic critic Jim DeRogatis describes it as \"the Beatles' first great psychedelic rock song\". It has been noted for its slowed-down rhythm track and backwards vocals, anticipating the studio experimentation of \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and other songs on \"Revolver\", which was released two months later.\n\nThe Beatles created three promotional films for \"Rain\" which are considered among the early precursors of music videos. These videos, along with other Beatles videos at the time, sparked George Harrison to say during the \"Beatles Anthology\", \"So I suppose, in a way, we invented MTV.\"\n\nThe films were directed by Michael Lindsay-Hogg who worked with them earlier on the pop 1960 television programme \"Ready Steady Go!\" One features the Beatles walking and singing in a garden and a greenhouse (filmed 20 May 1966 at Chiswick House in London). The other two feature the band performing on a sound stage (filmed 19 May 1966, one in colour for Ed Sullivan and the other in black and white for the UK). McCartney was injured in a moped accident on 26 December 1965, six months prior to the filming of \"Rain\" and closeups in the film reveal a scarred lip and a chipped tooth. McCartney's appearance in the film played a role in the \"Paul is dead\" rumours from 1969.\n\n\"The Beatles' Anthology\" documentary video includes a re-edit of two of these three clips, full of rhythmic fast cuts and several shots that went unused in the original videos. This creates an impression that the videos were more technically complex, fast-paced, and innovative than was the case. For example, the backwards film effects shown here are 1990s creations. Such effects were actually first deployed in the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" promotional film of January 1967.\n\nU2 has played the song in whole or in part throughout many of their tours, usually during outdoor concerts when it has started to rain. Pearl Jam improvised the song into their song \"Jeremy\" during their 1992 Pinkpop Festival show and played it in full at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2012. Kula Shaker covered the song live at Reading Festival in 1996 as did Fairport Convention, featuring Dan Ar Braz, at the Cropredy Festival in 1997. Todd Rundgren has also covered the song, as has the late Dan Fogelberg, who reprised it as part of his own cover of \"Rhythm of the Rain\". The Grateful Dead played it twenty times throughout the early 1990s.\n\nThe Beatles tribute act derives its name from the song.\n\nIn 2016 Aloe Blacc sings it as Boris the Frog in the eponymous Beat Bugs episode 3b.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36840228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36840228", "title": "Shahid (film)", "text": "Shahid (film)\n\nShahid is a 2013 Indian Hindi language biographical drama film directed by Hansal Mehta. Jointly produced by Anurag Kashyap, UTV Spotboy and Sunil Bohra, it is based on the life of lawyer and human rights activist Shahid Azmi who was assassinated in 2010. The film stars Rajkummar Rao in the titular role; Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub, Prabhleen Sandhu and Baljinder Kaur appear in supporting roles.\n\nMehta took a break after some of his films were box-office failures. When he heard about Azmi's murder, he felt the need to make a film about his life. He began his research for the film nearly three months after Azmi's murder. Mehta met writer Sameer Gautam Singh, who wrote the screenplay after researching Azmi's life and spending months interviewing Azmi's family. Apurva Asrani did additional work on the screenplay with Mehta. Asrani also served as the film's editor. Anuj Dhawan was the director of photography.\n\n\"Shahid\" had its world premiere at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival's City to City programme in 2012. It was screened at several other film festivals including the 14th Mumbai Film Festival, the New York Indian Film Festival, the Indian Film Festival Stuttgart, the Dubai International Film Festival and the Chicago South Asian Film Festival. The film was awarded the Silver Gateway Trophy at the Mumbai film festival while Mehta won the Best Director award. Mehta also won the best director award at New York Indian Film Festival and at the Indian Film Festival of Stuttgart. The film was released theatrically in India on 18 October 2013 and met with critical acclaim. Rao received the Best Actor Award and Mehta the Best Director Award at the 61st National Film Awards ceremony.\n\nShahid Azmi and his family are terrorised during the Bombay riots, when hundreds of Muslims died. Later he goes to Kashmir and spends a brief period at a militant training camp but soon returns after witnessing an execution. He moves back to Mumbai where he is arrested under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, for an alleged conspiracy to assassinate some politicians. His brother Arif Azmi tries to bail him out but fails. Shahid is tortured by police and forced to admit to the crime, after which he spends seven years at Tihar Jail in New Delhi. During his incarceration Omar Sheikh (Prabal Panjabi) tries to brainwash him. Another inmate, Ghulam Navi Waar, inspires him to begin his college education, and once he is acquitted of the charges, he studies law in Mumbai.\n\nAfter receiving his law degree, Shahid works with lawyer Maqbool Memon for a few months, before starting his career as an independent lawyer with the financial support of his elder brother Arif. During this process he meets Mariam, a Muslim divorcee, and marries her. Shahid soon starts picking up cases of Muslims charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA). He fights many cases pro bono in consultation with non-governmental organizations. Shahid's first major success as a defence lawyer is winning an acquittal, due to lack of evidence, for Arif Paanwala who was arrested under POTA for the 2002 Mumbai bus bombing.\n\nShahid represents the accused in the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, the 2006 Aurangabad arms haul, and the 2006 Malegaon bombings case. He is criticised for supporting terrorists and starts getting threatening calls that disturb his family life. On one occasion, Shahid's face is blackened by assailants outside the court room. While defending Faheem Ansari in the 2008 Mumbai attacks case, he is shot by two gunmen in his office and dies on the spot. Later, Ansari is shown to be acquitted of all charges by the Supreme Court of India due to lack of evidence.\n\n\nDirector Hansal Mehta said that he needed a break after some of his films proved to be a box-office failures, like \"Woodstock Villa\" (2007) and \"Raakh\" (2010). On 11 February 2010, lawyer Shahid Azmi was shot dead in his office in Mumbai at the age of 32. He had represented those accused of the 2006 Mumbai local train blasts, the 2006 Malegaon blasts case and while he was defending Faheem Ansari in the 26/11 attacks case that he was killed. He was arrested during the communal riots of 1992-1993 in Mumbai and later studied law and began defending people arrested on false charges. The lawyer secured 17 acquittals in his seven-year career. Mehta said that when he heard about Azmi's murder, he had a sense that the tale of his life could pull his \"creativity out of the rut\". He felt that Azmi lived an \"ordinary life, with extraordinary conviction to do what he believed was right\" and that his story \"had to be told\". Mehta began his research nearly three months after Azmi's murder. He later met writer Sameer Gautam Singh, who approached Mehta with a script. Mehta said he could not make a film with the script and asked him if he was would co-write another script with him. Singh agreed, and Mehta sent him along with his son Jai Mehta to Azmi's hometown to meet his family. To gather facts they interviewed his family members and friends for two months. Mehta chose not to go with them as he feared that seeing a filmmaker family and friends would \"alter the version of Shahid's life they narrated\".\n\nBoth Mehta and Singh read several of Azmi's cases for the story. Mehta noticed that they were written in simple English that could be understood by anyone: \"It told me he was a no-nonsense guy. He wanted to fight the battle and not beat around the bush.\" Mehta and Singh also met his colleagues, attended court sessions, petitions, litigations and learned how to get a client acquitted. Mehta went to seek permission to make the film; family members expressed their skepticism about the project. Later, they agreed and talked to him about Azmi. The film focused on Azmi's beginnings and two cases he handled: the 2006 Mumbai train bombings and the 2008 Mumbai attacks. Mehta combined several of Azmi's petitions into a single case for \"clarity and dramatic impact\". Mehta said the Azmi's family was supportive of the film.\n\nMehta was looking for \"big stars\" for the film, but most were not interested because of his earlier failures. At the time, the film's co-producer Anurag Kashyap suggested he cast Rajkummar Rao thinking he was perfect for the role of Azmi. Later, casting director Mukesh Chhabra sent Rao to Mehta's office. Mehta cast him after a screen test. Mehta felt Rao \"surrendered himself completely\" to the film. In preparing for the role, Rao met Azmi's family and spent time with them to understand the man and his personality. He also studied the Quran and attended courtrooms to understand how lawyers behave. Rao said he was \"emotionally drained\" as the character was challenging and complex. In the scenes where he had to cry, Rao said he could not stop himself, thinking about what Azmi had to go through. Tigmanshu Dhulia, Prabhleen Sandhu, Kay Kay Menon and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub played supporting roles in the film. The scene where Azmi's face is blackened by assailants outside a courtroom was a re-enactment of an incident from Mehta's own life. In 2000, members of Shiv Sena who were protesting his film \"Dil Pe Mat Le Yaar!!\" attacked him and vandalised his office.\n\n\"Shahid\" was made on a production budget of and filmed in complete secrecy. It was shot in several Mumbai neighbourhoods Azmi had frequented including Kurla, Govandi and Pydhonie. Mehta chose to shoot in the apartment above Azmi’s ground floor residence in the Taximen's Colony as he wanted to \"capture the sense of claustrophobia and unkemptness of his home\". Some portions of the film were shot in Azmi's office and his colony. \"Shahid\" was also shot in Nagpada, where Faheem Ansari's wife Yasmin lives. The scenes in the terrorist training camp were shot in Himachal Pradesh.\n\nMehta decided to depict realistic court scenes based on his team's observation of real courts. They visited the Andheri Court and the Esplanade Court among others, taking photographs to recreate the ambiance for the courtroom scenes. Courtroom sets were built because filming in an actual court is not permitted.\n\nThe film's unit consisted of about 17 people because of budget and time constraints; it was made on a budget of . The film was shot linearly on a non-linear draft. Mehta said it was filmed guerilla style using all \"available digital formats without really worrying about which lens was available\". The filmmaker used only natural or minimal lighting. For an interrogation scene, Rao suggested Mehta show him naked as he wanted to \"feel the embarrassment, the mental pain of the character.\" The film's editor, Apurva Asrani, edited the film in a linear order as he felt an earlier version was \"not working\". Mehta ultimately decided to give him a screenplay credit as he felt Asrani \"shaped the narrative\" of the film.\n\n\"Shahid\" was jointly produced by Kashyap, UTV Spotboy and Sunil Bohra. Azmi had defended Kashyap's film \"Black Friday\" in the courts while it was debarred from release by the censor board. Anuj Dhawan served as the film's director of photography.\nMehta said that they had a lot of material they did not use as \"not all of it could translate into a scene\"; he wanted the film to be more accessible. Azmi's brother Khalid Azmi said of the film's authenticity that \"it is 95 percent accurate.\"\n\n\"Shahid\" premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival in its \"City to City\" programme in September 2012. The film was screened at several film festivals including the 14th Mumbai Film Festival, the New York Indian Film Festival, the Indian Film Festival Stuttgart, the Dubai International Film Festival and the Chicago South Asian Film Festival. The film's album soundtrack consisted of one song titled \"Beparwah\", sung by Arjit Singh. The film's poster, which showed Rao's blackened face, was also released. The official trailer was unveiled on 20 September 2013. The film opened in India on 18 October 2013 around 400 screens. A private screening of the film was held for the cast and crew before its release.\n\n\"Shahid\" received mostly positive review from the critics with particular praise for Rao's performance. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV called it a \"gritty, gutsy, bold and brave\" film that articulates \"uncomfortable truths about contemporary India, its media, its judiciary and, of course, its people.\" Sify's Sonia Chopra gave a positive review, writing that the film \"salutes the man who walked a unique path\" and does \"full justice to the man and his extraordinary life.\" Rajeev Masand wrote in his review: \"The film itself is brave and unflinching, and oozes the kind of sincerity that you long for in most Hindi films.\" Madhureeta Mukherjee of \"The Times of India\" said the film is \"brutally honest, brave and above all a fascinating humane story\". Trisha of \"Firstpost\" felt Mehta's directorial style echoed \"Azmi's own commitment to a truth in which thoughtless actions produce victims, rather than villainy producing heroes.\"\n\nShubhra Gupta of \"The Indian Express\" mentioned in her review that the film \"needed to have been made\" and Mehta \"tells it straight, without any false flourishes\". She also praised Rao's performance, saying he \"wears the character like skin, and becomes Shahid.\" \"India Today\"s Suhani Singh gave a positive review, writing the film \"stops short of hero worship and is a fitting tribute to an inspiring figure.\" Anupama Chopra praised Rao's performance in the film and called it his \"triumph, [..] his \"Shahid\" has strength, anguish and a controlled anger, but also real charm.\" Vinayak Chakravorty of \"India Today\" called it a \"career-defining role\" for Rao and the \"biggest reason you will love this unusual film.\" Baradwaj Rangan called the film a \"deeply humanistic drama\" and said the film \"makes us think, but more often, it makes us feel.\" \"Mid Day\"s Shubha Shetty Saha wrote: \"Not often do we get the opportunity to watch a relevant movie that depicts the times we live in, with unblinking directness.\"\n\nPrasanna D Zore of Rediff.com called it a \"gutsy and thought-provoking film\", she added that it is not an \"in your face film\": \"It is a subtle, thought-provoking and gutsy story of a person who believed in the power of truth and justice yet knew that the path he had taken was strewn with risks, indifference and ignominy.\" Saurav Datta of \"Daily News and Analysis\" felt the film was \"incomplete\" without showing Azmi's younger brother's role as he took over his job; he felt the film also concluded with an \"abrupt, grinding halt\". \"Mint\"s Sanjukta Sharma called it an \"admirable project\" and praised Rao's performance but felt the film fell \"short of a masterpiece\" as a biopic. Namrata Joshi of \"Outlook\" wrote that the film \"portrays the psyche of the Indian Muslim in the changing, increasingly polarised India with warmth and simplicity.\" \"Reuters\" Shilpa Jamkhandikar responded positively to the film and praised Rao's performance: \"As Shahid, Raj Kumar injects the right amount of earnestness, anger and vulnerability into his role, to make this one of the best performances we have seen this year.\" Journalist and writer Rana Ayyub called the film a \"brave and worthy tribute to [Azmi's] work and courage.\"\n\nAmong overseas reviewers, Omer M. Mozaffar of RogerEbert.com praised Mehta's direction and called his work a \"pleasant surprise\": \"the lack of polish at first seems like a film school weakness, but grows into a well-crafted asset, especially in his deliberate fades to black.\" Rachel Saltz of \"The New York Times\" gave a positive review writing: \"[Mehta] has made a film of conviction that’s neither plodding nor preachy.\" However, Saltz felt the second half of the film was \"truncated and overstuffed\". Mohammad Kamran Jawaid of \"Dawn\", gave the film a positive review writing that the two-hour time constraint \"means there's little room for the traditional expansion we get from biopics, and if at times \"Shahid\" feels like an expanded best-of Mr. Azmi's life, it's because it is\".\n\n\"Shahid\" was mentioned in critic and author Shubhra Gupta's book, \"50 Films That Changed Bollywood, 1995-2015\".\n\n\"Shahid\" opened to small audiences in theatres and earned a total of .

It takes place every Saturday in an empty lot. The name Smorgasburg is a portmanteau of “Smörgåsbord” and “Williamsburg.” Dozens of vendors sell their food and wares. It initially was started in 2011, by Jonathan Butler and Eric Demby as an offshoot of Brooklyn Flea. Originally, some businesses were not able to set up at Brooklyn Flea due to limited space, so the founders created a food-centered version of the original market. They chose Brooklyn due to location and affordability of space. The food tends to be small-batch and innovative foods. Smorgasburg grew quickly in popularity and some vendors were able to upgrade to brick-and-mortar locations.\n\nThere is wide variety of food from over 100 vendors. It has since expanded to other locations, which are subject to change. Currently, it is open in Williamsburg on Saturdays and Prospect Park on Sundays from April through October in both locations. It has also expanded to Los Angeles in 2016. It takes place every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Alameda Produce Market. This was also a way to revive a part of Los Angeles that was dead for many years, which is now referred to as The Row.

{"id": "4646835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4646835", "title": "St Nedelya Church assault", "text": "St Nedelya Church assault\n\nThe St Nedelya Church assault was a terrorist attack on St Nedelya Church in Sofia, Bulgaria. It was carried out on 16 April 1925, when a group of the Bulgarian Communist Party blew up the church's roof during the funeral service of General Konstantin Georgiev, who had been killed in a previous communist assault on 14 April. 150 people, mainly from the country's political and military elite, were killed in the attack and around 500 were injured.\n\nAfter the failure of the September Uprising in 1923 and the prohibition of the BCP by the Bulgarian Supreme Court of Appeal on 2 April 1924, the Communist Party found itself in a difficult situation. The government arrested many activists and the organization's very existence was under threat. A Special Punitive Group was established as part of the Central Committee of the BCP, including Yako Dorosiev, Captain Ivan Minkov and Vulko (or Valko) Chervenkov. The Military Organization (MO) of the BCP, led by Minkov and Major Kosta Yankov, set up small isolated groups (\"шесторки\", \"shestorki\") that carried out individual attacks. This, however, did not prevent the police from discovering and destroying the illegal structures of the BCP with relative ease.\n\nLater, in December 1924, the organization recruited Petar Zadgorski, a sexton at the church. Dimitar Hadzhidimitrov and Dimitar Zlatarev, head of the MO armaments section, suggested that Police Director Vladimir Nachev be assassinated and a large-scale assault be carried out during his funeral service. In this way they hoped to eliminate a large number of key figures in the police hierarchy and thus lessen the pressure that the authorities exerted on the BCP. The idea was welcomed by Stanke Dimitrov, Secretary of the Central Committee, who discussed it with Georgi Dimitrov and Vasil Kolarov, General Secretary of the Comintern, in early 1925. Nevertheless, they did not approve the proposal, as they thought such an action should first be preceded by preparations for a large-scale uprising that would follow the attack.\n\nMeanwhile, the government continued to increase its pressure on the BCP. Following the killing of Valcho Ivanov, an influential functionary, on 11 February 1925, an amendment to the Law for the Protection of the State which increased the power of the authorities was introduced on 10 March. Yako Dorosiev, head of the MO, was then assassinated on 26 March. These events threatened the physical survival of the BCP leaders and angered the MO leadership. They announced that they were ready to put their plan into practice despite the Comintern's disapproval. It has been theorized that the assailants acted with the support of Soviet services, but there is no documentary evidence to support this hypothesis.\n\nThe MO management assigned one of its groups to the task, led by Petar Abadzhiev, who himself recruited the sexton, Petar Zadgorski. With his help, Abadzhiev and Asen Pavlov carried in a total of 25 kg of explosives to the attic of St Nedelya Church over the course of a couple of weeks. The explosives were mounted in a package above one of the columns of the main dome, situated by the south entrance to the building. The plan was to detonate the bomb by a 15 m-long cord that would allow the assailants a chance to escape.\n\nDue to the strengthened guard at Vladimir Nachev's funeral service, the MO chose another victim whose funeral would be used as bait for the assault. At 8 pm on 14 April General Konstantin Georgiev, a deputy of the ruling Democratic Accord, was assassinated by Atanas Todovichin in front of a Sofia church while heading there for the evening service with his granddaughter.\n\nThe funeral service of General Georgiev was set for 16 April, Holy Thursday. In order to increase the toll, the organizers sent forged invitations on behalf of the Association of Reserve Officers. At 7 am on the 16th, Zadgorski led Nikola Petrov to the roof, where Petrov would detonate the bomb on Zadgorski's signal. The funeral procession entered the church at 3 pm that afternoon. The service was conducted by Bishop Stefan, the future Bulgarian Exarch. The coffin was initially placed right next to the column that was to be blown up, but then moved forward due to the large number of people that came to attend the ceremony.\nIn accordance with the MO group's plan, when the congregation had gathered and the service began, Zadgorski gave Nikola Petrov a signal to detonate, after which the two left the building at around 3:20. The explosion demolished the main dome of the church, burying many people inside. The blast indoors caused further damage. 150 people died during the explosion and another 500 were injured. By chance, all government members survived. The monarch, Tsar Boris III, was not in the church, as he was attending the funerals of those killed in the attempt on his own life in the Arabakonak pass in Stara Planina. Among the victims were General Kalin Naydenov (Minister of War during World War I); Stefan Nerezov, commander of the Bulgarian Army at Dojran; General Ivan Popov, General Grigor Kyurkchiev, then-Mayor of Sofia Paskal Paskalev, as well as another governor, the chief of police, and three deputies. 25 women and children were also killed.\n\nThe evening after the assault, martial law was declared. The attack caused a wave of violent repressions organized by the Military Union with the government's tacit approval. During the following two weeks, approximately 450 people were executed without trial, including poet Geo Milev and journalist Yosif Herbst. (A mass grave of those killed in 1925 was discovered in the 1950s during the construction of a dam, and Milev's corpse was identified by his glass eye - he had lost an eye in World War I.) Many other communists were heavily judged for taking part in the organization. The MO leaders Kosta Yankov and Ivan Minkov were among those assassinated. A few of the organizers of the attack, such as Zlatarev, Petar Abadzhiev and Nikola Petrov, managed to escape to the Soviet Union through Yugoslavia. Abandoned by his party, Zadgorski surrendered to the police and made a confession.\n\nThe assault trial took place before a military court in Sofia between 1-11 May 1925. Zadgorski, Lieutenant-Colonel Georgi Koev, who unsuccessfully attempted to hide Minkov, and Marko Fridman, an MO section leader, were all sentenced to death. Stanke Dimitrov, Petar Abadzhiev, Dimitar Grancharov, Nikolay Petrini and Hristo Kosovski received capital punishment by default, with the last three of those having already been killed in the previous weeks.\nMarko Fridman, the highest-ranked individual of those accused, confessed that the organization was financed and supplied with weaponry from the Soviet Union, but pinned the ultimate responsibility for the attack on Yankov and Minkov, who, according to Fridman, acted without the BCP management's agreement.\n\n\n"}

In the modern age, victory parades typically take the form of celebrating a national victory, rather than a personal one.\n\nIn the former USSR including the Russian Federation victory parades are held annually in every major city celebrating the victory of the Soviet Union in the Great Patriotic War (1941–1945).\n\n\n\n\n\nParades are traditionally held on 9 May to celebrate the victory in World War II over Nazi Germany.\n\n\n\n\n\nCities hosting the winning sports team in one of the four major league sports will host a victory parade in the city that the team represents. \n\n"}

It was organised by the Yamaha Music Foundation in Tokyo, Japan from 1970 until 1989. The first edition of the World Popular Song Festival (WPSF) took place on 20, 21 and 22 November 1970 with 37 participating countries from all continents. The concert was cancelled in 1988 due to the illness of the Shōwa Emperor; the final year was a charity concert for UNICEF, after which the contest was formally ended.\n\nBelgium was represented at the 1970 edition by Daliah Lavi, famous for her role in \"Casino Royale\" (1967), the James Bond parody featuring Woody Allen as well with Samantha Gilles in 1987 ending second with the song Hold Me. Lavi performed the chanson \"Prends L'Amour\" and ended up 13th in the Grand Final (the contest had two semi-finals and one final). The Netherlands delegated world-known jazz singer Rita Reys with the song \"Just Be You\", a composition by her husband Pim Jacobs. Czech singer Helena Vondráčková sang \"Uncle Charlie\" a novelty song inspired by Charlie Chaplin. Other famous 1970 participants were 1969 Eurovision winner Frida Boccara for France, Jacques Michel for Canada and Ted Mulry for Australia, who scored a national number 1 hit with his entry. Winner of the 1st WPSF was Israel with the duo Hedva & David. More than 2 million copies of their winning entry \"Ani Holem Al Naomi\" (\"I Dream Of Naomi\") were sold worldwide, giving a serious credibility boost to the new Festival.\n\nWell established names as well as new talents tried their fortune at the WPSF: a very young ABBA under the name Björn & Benny with uncredited backing vocals by their partners Agnetha and Anni-Frid performing the track \"Santa Rosa\" with little success (later relegated to the B-side of their second single \"He Is Your Brother\"), Céline Dion (Best Song Award in 1982), Bryan Adams (Participating in 1982), Bucks Fizz (Best Song Award in 1981), Tina Charles, Eros Ramazzotti, Daniela Romo, Gianna Nannini, Demis Roussos, Bonnie Tyler, B.J. Thomas, La Toya Jackson, Erasure, Cissy Houston, Italian singer-songwriter Alice and many others.\n\nIn the history of the WPSF, the United Kingdom has been the most successful, winning the \"WPSF Grand Prix\" 5 times in the seventies (even three times in row). The United Kingdom is followed by the United States with 4 Grand Prix victories. Smaller countries won as well: Jamaica in 1972 with Ernie Smith, Norway in 1974 with Ellen Nikolaysen, Cuba in 1981 with Osvaldo Rodríguez and Hungary in 1983 with Neoton Família.\n\n\n"}
