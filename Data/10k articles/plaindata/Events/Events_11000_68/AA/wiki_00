{"id": "11882187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11882187", "title": "1923 Constitution of Romania", "text": "1923 Constitution of Romania\n\nThe 1923 Constitution of Romania, also called the Constitution of Union, was intended to align the organisation of the state on the basis of universal male suffrage and the new realities that arose after the Great Union of 1918. Four draft constitutions existed: one belonging to the National Liberal Party, written with contributions from Ion I. C. Brătianu; one composed by R. Boilă at Cluj, under the influence of the Romanian National Party; one by Constantin Stere, representing the views of the Peasants' Party; and a fourth by C. Berariu. Except for Stere’s proposal, which involved a unicameral legislature, proportional representation and popular consultation through the plebiscite, the other three were inspired (when it came to political organisation) by the 1866 Constitution. The Liberals came to power in 1922 and managed to push through their own draft, which was approved 247-8 (with two abstentions) in the Chamber of Deputies on March 26, 1923, and the next day in the Senate, 137-2 (with two abstentions). It was published in \"Monitorul Oficial\" and came into force on March 29.\n\nThe constitution had eight titles and 138 articles, of which 76 came in their entirety from its predecessor. It enshrined the principles of popular sovereignty (exercised through representatives), separation of powers in the state, rule of law and decentralisation. Rights and freedoms for all citizens were recognised, regardless of ethnicity, language, religion or social class; the right to own property was guaranteed and, for the first time, the nationalisation of mineral deposits was provided for. The Kingdom of Romania was defined as a “unitary and indivisible national state”, with an inalienable territory. The state guaranteed freedom of expression and assembly, of conscience and of religion, and declared that “as the Romanian Orthodox Church is the religion of the great majority of Romanians it is the dominant church in the Romanian State, while the Greek-Catholic Church has primacy before other faiths”.\n\nRegarding state organisation, legislative power was entrusted to Parliament (Senate and Assembly of Deputies) and the King; executive power to the King, who delegated it to the Council of Ministers; and judicial power to the central and local judicial organs. The right to vote was expanded beyond the 1866 regulations: it was universal for all males, equal, direct, compulsory and secret, based on majority representation. The Assembly of Deputies was elected through universal suffrage, while the Senate comprised members elected by different electoral bodies (the Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Agriculture and Labour, and professors, all divided into separate colleges), and members by right: the heir to the throne; Metropolitan bishops; diocesan bishops of the Orthodox and Greek-Catholic churches; heads of state-recognised religious bodies; the president of the Romanian Academy; former presidents of the Council of Ministers; former ministers with at least six years’ seniority; former presidents of either legislative chamber who held this function for at least eight ordinary sessions; former senators and deputies elected to at least ten legislatures, irrespective of their duration; former presidents of the High Court of Cassation and Justice; reserve and retired generals; former presidents of the National Assemblies at Chişinău, Cernăuţi and Alba Iulia, which proclaimed their respective provinces’ union with Romania in 1918.\n\nA special section discussing the King provides that the throne should remain with the House of Hohenzollern, “from male to male in order of primogeniture and with the perpetual exclusion of women and their descendants”. The King’s person was declared inviolable, and ministers had responsibility for his acts, as any act of the sovereign had to be countersigned by a minister, who then became responsible for it.\n\nAlthough the constitution was very advanced and democratic in many respects, it also contained imperfections in the functioning of state institutions that made it easy to subvert democracy. For instance, the King appointed the president of the Council of Ministers, who then organised elections. The government was thus in a position to ensure that its party won a majority in the legislature. In a well-functioning democracy, a government represents the will of parliament and not vice versa, as generally happened in the interwar period.\n\nThe 1923 Constitution was abrogated when its February 1938 successor came into force. It was then partly revived after the King Michael Coup of August 23, 1944, and definitively abrogated when Romania became a republic on December 30, 1947. During this latter period, in July 1946, the Senate was abolished—the only significant modification to the document.\n\n\n"}

Thus, if a person who has consumed alcohol and has stopped for a red light is rear-ended by a completely sober but inattentive driver, the accident is listed as alcohol-related, although alcohol had nothing to do with causing the accident. Furthermore, if a sober motorist hits a drunk pedestrian, the accident is also listed as alcohol-related. Alcohol-related accidents are often mistakenly confused with alcohol-caused accidents. Some have criticized the NHTSA for compiling this statistic since it may give the impression that drunk drivers cause a much higher percentage of accidents and does not accurately reflect the problem of drunk driving in the United States.\n\nNationally, 31% of all drivers involved in fatal accidents during 2013 are known to have been intoxicated according to the blood alcohol concentration (BAC laws) of their state. This number is based on a systematic examination of the official records of each and every accident involving a fatality during that year in the US. However, a majority of fatalities resulting from car accidents involving alcohol are from sober drivers who are hit by drunk drivers.\n\nThe higher number (about 40%) commonly reported refers to accidents defined as alcohol-related as estimated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\nEach year, The Century Council, a national non-profit organization funded by a group of alcohol manufacturers, compiles a document of alcohol-related traffic fatalities. Between 1991 and 2013, the rate of alcohol-related traffic fatalities (ARTF) per 100,000 population has decreased 52% nationally, and 79% among youth under 21.\n\n\n"}

The publication of Yasusada's poetry by major literary journals including the \"American Poetry Review\", \"Grand Street\" and \"Conjunctions\" during the early 1990s created an embarrassing scandal for these publications.\n\nAraki Yasusada was supposedly a survivor of the Hiroshima atom bomb. He was born in 1907, attended Hiroshima University (before it was even founded, in 1949), worked in the postal service, and was conscripted into the Japanese army during World War II. He died of cancer in 1972. His son discovered his poems and notebooks and in 1991 they began to appear in print in the United States.\n\nThe 'notebooks' included editorial comments, smudged ink and illegible text, and other elaborate attempts to give the appearance of authenticity. They also included hints leading to their own unravelling, however, such as references to poets who probably would not be known to Japanese poets of the period and anachronistic references to such things as scuba divers.\n\nThe real writer of the poems is widely believed to be Kent Johnson, professor of Highland Community College in Freeport, Illinois, though he has never claimed authorship. Beliefs about Johnson's role as author stem in no small part from the fact that Johnson edited the Yasusada texts for the Wesleyan University Press. Johnson also included Yasusada's poetry in his doctoral dissertation.\n\nThe texts that had been published in the poetry journals were sent to various academics from a variety of locations, presenting Yasusada as an invented persona that was used by one or more people who intended the keep the origin of the texts secret.\n\nJohnson admitted to some critics that Yasusada was nothing but an invented pseudonym \"somebody\" used to conceal the writer's origin. Some editors, who asked Johnson who the real writer was, claim to have received different answers. One response was that the real writer was \"Tosa Motokiyu,\" one of the three \"Japanese translators\" — or at least, 95 percent of the poems were his, the rest being Johnson's older work, which Motokiyu had requested to include in his Yasusada fiction. Johnson continued to lecture on Yasusada and denied the hoax in interviews. At one stage he claimed that Motokiyu asked Johnson to take credit for the poems before Motokiyu's death. Yet elsewhere he said that Motokiyu's name was yet another pseudonym.\n\nThere were a number of rumors about other supposed co-authors, including the leading avant-garde Mexican composer, Javier Alvarez, who appears as co-editor of the work with Johnson. Publishers demanded their money back and criticized the hoax. Wesleyan cancelled the publication of the poetry collection. Some critics noticed that Johnson had published similar poetry in 1986 under the name of Ogiwara Miyamori, in \"Ironwood\" magazine.\n\nAfter the 'hoax' was discovered, several journals rejected previously accepted poems. The hoax has allegedly been called \"a criminal act\" by Arthur Vogelsang, editor of \"American Poetry Review\", which had previously published a special supplement of Yasusada poems, including an alleged portrait of the author, but in letters to the \"Boston Review\" he denied having used the phrase. But numerous critics were supportive, praising both the conceptual nature of the fiction and the quality of the writing, including Roof Books that published the entire text in 1997.\n\n"}

He became well known to the United States' public after he stood next to President George W. Bush as the president gave a speech at the ruins of the World Trade Center after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Photos of Beckwith and the president appeared on the front page of the \"New York Daily News\" and the cover of \"Time\" magazine. This exposure launched him into the national spotlight and led to press attention and interviews. Beckwith has met several times with President Bush since then, spoken extensively in public, and acted as a fundraiser for charities.\n\nBeckwith has lived for more than 50 years with his wife Barbara in the same house in Baldwin, Nassau County, New York. The couple has six adult children. Beckwith is a veteran of the New York City Fire Department with 30 years of service.\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, Beckwith was tending to his grandson, who had been hit by a car while biking to school. Before he arrived at the hospital with his grandson, Beckwith was aware that a plane had struck the World Trade Center. When the boy appeared to be in stable condition, Beckwith left the hospital and went to World Trade Center site after he saw the South Tower collapse via television. Even though he had been retired for seven years from the New York City Fire Department, he grabbed his old gear and bluffed his way past the blockades and barricades that had been set up and began helping with bucket brigades and missing person searches.\n\nOn September 14, after Beckwith and some men had unearthed a fire engine buried in rubble from the fallen buildings, they tested its stability as a stand from which to speak, and a Secret Service agent ordered him to help President Bush onto the platform. Beckwith handed Bush a bullhorn with which to address the crowd of responders and workers and was told to climb down by the Secret Service and Karl Rove, but Bush insisted that Beckwith stay with him. An image of Bush with Beckwith was featured the next day on the front page of the \"New York Daily News\".\n\nA photo of Bush with Beckwith standing together was published two weeks later on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, catapulting Beckwith to the national spotlight. Rejecting his new-found fame, he initially refused to speak to various news personalities and shows—Diane Sawyer, the \"Today Show\", and Rosie O'Donnell—though he eventually appeared on MSNBC and other news channels and programs.\n\nBeckwith continues to be bashful about his fame, though an enlarged version of the \"Time\" magazine cover that made him famous hangs in his den. Regarding the cover, Beckwith said that \"[a]ll these guys that come over to interview me, they all have to have a picture of it.\" Beckwith also has a first edition print of the cover, which is encased in a display box together with a flag that waved at Ground Zero, given to him by President Bush. Beckwith has volunteered to have the items in his possession go to the 9/11 Memorial after he dies. He has already donated the clothes and helmet that he was wearing that day to the memorial.\n\nBeckwith has visited 11 times with President Bush, traveled and spoken extensively, and dedicated much of his activity to fundraising for the New York Firefighters Burn Center Foundation.\n\nOn February 25, 2002, in a White House ceremony together with Governor George Pataki of New York state, Beckwith presented to Bush the bullhorn the president had used to address workers at the World Trade Center site just days after the attacks.\n\nIn the wake of the killing of Osama bin Laden by a team of U.S. Navy Seals, Beckwith was asked his opinion. He stated: \"I would have liked it to be on George Bush's watch, but it wasn't, so OK\". He also said: \"But I'm glad we got him. He's burning in hell and he's going to rot there.\"\n\n"}

It was the first public theatre in Oslo and in Norway, and the predecessor of the Christiania Theatre.\n\nThe theater was founded by the Swedish theatre director Johan Peter Strömberg. With the exception of the unsuccessfull attempt of Martin Nürenbach in 1772, there was no public theatre in Oslo or anywhere in Norway prior to 1827. Theatre was performed by foreign travelling theatre companies, or privately by \"Det Dramatiske Selskab\".\n\nStrömberg wished to establish a professional public theatre in Norway, with professional native actors. He obtained a theater permit from the Danish crown, and founded the first dramatic school in 1825 in order to train the first group of native actors.\n\nIn 30 January 1827, the theatre was inaugurated with a performance of Strömberg's students, the pioneer group of Norwegian actors. However, the Norwegian actors was not considered trained enough to meet the standars of the audience, and Strömberg was forced to engage trained actors from Denmark. On 4 November 1827, Strömberg performed his play \"Fredsfesten\" in praise of the unpopular Swedish-Norwegian Union, which attracted great criticism. In the spring of 1828, Strömberg was declared bancrupt, rented the theatre and the theatre permit to one of his Danish actors, Jens Lang Bøcher, and returned to Sweden. Jens Lang Bøcher replaced almost all of the Norwegian staff with Danes, allowing only five Norwegians to remain.

The third of these was Chunee. He travelled on the East Indiaman, , from Bengal, arriving in England in July 1811. \n\nThe other two elephants, also owned by Stephani Polito at some point, arrived in England in September 1809, and June 1810.\n\"Mr Polito ... has obtained possession of a remarkably fine Elephant, brought to England in the Hon. East India Company's ship, Winchelsea, Capt. William Moffat, which will be exhibited at Rumsey [sic] fair on Monday; and it is expected he will be offered for public inspection for a day or two, in this town , on his way to the Exeter 'Change London.\"\nThe second elephant was brought to England from Sri Lanka on the East India Company ship in June 1810.\n\nChunee was originally exhibited at the Covent Garden Theatre, but was bought by circus owner Stephani Polito to join his menagerie at Exeter Exchange on the Strand in London. The menagerie was bought by Edward Cross in 1817. The events in which the elephant was put to death in 1826 became a cause célèbre.\n\nChunee weighed nearly 7 tons, was 11 feet tall, and was valued at £1,000. He was tame, and was originally a theatrical animal, appearing on stage with Edmund Kean. His plays included \"Blue Beard\", at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, and the pantomime \"Harlequin and Padmanaba, or the Golden Fish\", at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.\n\nChunee was trained to take a sixpence from visitors to the menagerie to hold with his trunk before returning it. An entry in Lord Byron's journal records a visit to Exeter Exchange on 14 November 1813, when \"The elephant took and gave me my money again — took off my hat — opened a door — trunked a whip — and behaved so well, that I wish he was my butler.\"\n\nChunee became dangerously violent towards the end of his life, attributed to an \"annual paroxysm\" (perhaps his musth) aggravated by a rotten tusk which gave him a bad toothache. On 26 February 1826, while on his usual Sunday walk along the Strand, Chunee ran amok, killing one of his keepers. He became increasingly enraged and difficult to handle over the following days, and it was decided that he was too dangerous to keep. The following Wednesday, 1 March, his keeper tried to feed him poison, but Chunee refused to eat it. Soldiers were summoned from Somerset House to shoot Chunee with their muskets. Kneeling down to the command of his trusted keeper, Chunee was hit by 152 musket balls, but refused to die. Chunee was finished off by a keeper with a harpoon or sword. The floor of his cage was deeply covered with his blood, and it was said that the sound of the elephant in agony was more alarming than the reports of the soldiers’ guns.\n\nHundreds of people paid the usual shilling entrance fee to see his carcass butchered, and then dissected by doctors and medical students from the Royal College of Surgeons. His skeleton weighed 876 lb (397 kg), and was sold for £100 and exhibited at the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly, and later at the Royal College of Surgeons in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the bullet holes clearly visible. His skin weighed 17 cwt (1,900 lb or 860 kg), and was sold to a tanner for £50. Chunee's skeleton was on display in the Hunterian Collection until 1941 when it had a direct hit from a Luftwaffe airstrike.\n\nThe manner of Chunee's death was widely publicised, with illustrations printed in popular newssheets of volley after volley being shot into his profusely bleeding body. Recipes were published for elephant stew, along with maudlin poems saying \"Farewell, poor Chuny\". Letters were printed in \"The Times\" protesting at the barbarity of the process, and the poor quality of the living conditions of the animals in the menagerie. The Zoological Society of London was founded in April 1826. The controversy was the inspiration for a successful play at Sadler's Wells, entitled \"Chuneelah; or, The Death of the Elephant at Exeter 'Change\".\n\nThe menagerie at Exeter Exchange declined in popularity after Chunee's death. The animals were moved to Surrey Zoological Gardens in 1828, and the building was demolished in 1829.\n\n"}

This law is referred as the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunal) Order 1972, commonly known as Collaborators Act, 1972.\n\nAbout 2,884 cases were filed under this law until October 1973. Of the accused, 752 were given punishment. Later on 31 October 1975, the Collaborators Act was dismissed due to several reasons and irregularities found in the law. The law was amended three times.\n\nThe Act, was designed to facilitate arrest and trial of accomplices as well as of local perpetrators of the genocide remained in place.\n\nWhat happened in Bangladesh between 25 March and 16 December 1971 epitomized the spirit of the human will as well as man's unlimited capacity to be brutal towards fellow men. Rarely in the history of mankind have a people displayed so much heroism and suffered so much pain within the space of so short a time as the people of Bangladesh did.\n\nDuring this war some Bengali civilians took the side of Pakistani Army of occupation. They collaborated the army to occupy the whole Bangladesh and supported the atrocities committed by them.\n\nThe members of Pakistan Muslim League, Jamaat-e-Islami, Nizam-e-Islam joined the Peace Committee, which was actually formed to support the atrocities. A dummy cabinet was formed under Nurul Amin in which Abul Kashem, Nawajesh Ahmed, AKM Yousuf, Abbas Ali Khan, Maolana Ishak joined. Obaydullah Mazumder, an Awami League leader also joined in the cabinet. After liberation 46 MNAs from Awami League was denounced or relegated from the party.\nOn the other hand, under the supervision of Pakistani Army another force named Rajakar was formed to replace the Ansar. Jamaat-e-Islami leader AKM Yousuf, with 96 members of Jamaat-e-Islami started a training camp in Khulna Ansar and VDP camp to fight against the freedom fighters. Most of the Rajakar personnel were the members of Jamaat-e-Islami\n\nAl-Shams and Al-Badr was also formed in order to counter the guerrilla activities of the Mukti Bahini which grew increasingly organised and militarily successful during in the second half of 1971. All three groups operated under Pakistani command.\n\nOn this regard, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman on his repatriation in Bangladesh on 10 January 1972, declared to try the collaborators along with the Pakistani Army who committed genocide and atrocities.\n\nThe process to try the collaborators during the first days of Bangladesh was not going through any legal process. People were angry and were killing the collaborators without any trail. These activities tarnished the overall image of the nation. Some were being killed because of personal issues. So a government was forced to create a law and begin a trial to pacify the agitation.\n\nThe Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 was announced to try the local war criminals. On 24 January 1972 an order came in effect.\n\nThe constitution of Bangladesh was also amended to include Article 47 (3) in order to fasten the trial of members \"of any armed or defence or auxiliary forces\" for genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. In addition, The International Crimes (Tribunals) Act, 1973 was announced on 20 July 1973 mainly to try the Pakistani war criminals.\n\nThe government also announced a two-tier trial process where national and international jurists would be appointed to try some high-profile war criminals, while an all-Bangladeshi jurist panel would try the rest.\n\nMany statements were provided by the responsible officials of the government of Bangladesh regarding this issue.\n\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman on his arrival on 10 January 1972 ensured that the collaborators will be tried along with their Pakistani masters. But he also asked his people to give the responsibility to the government\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman ordered Awami League leaders to gather proof against the collaborators and assured that the collaborators will be tried for times and again. On 12 January 1972, Rahman addressed people, saying that the criminals will not go unpunished under his government.\n\nMujib on 14 January asked the Awami League activists not to take revenge and assured that legislative measures will be taken against the collaborators in time.\n\nOn 30 March, in a public gathering in Chittagong he asked the people should he pardon the collaborators or not. The people of Chittagong said, \"No and never\".\n\nThe implementation of the law started on 15 February when an order signed by secretary Taslimuddin Ahmed was circulated stating that 14 top collaborators have to surrender. The list was made addressing Nurul Amin, Ghulam Azam, Khan A Sabur, Shah Azizur Rahman, Maulana Muhammad Ishaq, Khawaja Khayeruddin, Mahmud Ali, AKM Yousuf, Abbas Ali Khan and many others as collaborators. Awami League leader Obaydullah Mazumder of Feni was among the list of the collaborators.\n\nLater some 50,000 collaborators were arrested under the act. Among them 752 were found guilty and was punished.\n\nAbout 37,471 cases were filed under this law till October 1973. On 28 March 73 tribunals were formed to try the collaborators. It was also declared that other courts will refrain from the cases under these tribunals.\n\nAbout 2,884 cases were solved and the verdict was given under this law till October 1973 before the general amnesty was declared by Mujib. Only 752 of them were found guilty and only one of them was sentenced capital punishment. As many as two thousand were acquitted after the trial.\n\nTwo Jamaat-e-Islami leader AKM Yousuf and Abbas Ali Khan were arrested under the law. After the war, Yousuf was sentenced to life imprisonment under the 1972 Collaborator’s Order.\n\nSa'ad Ahmed, a leader from Kushtia was sentenced life imprisonment for supporting the atrocities as a East Pakistan Central Peace Committee member and taking part in the election of 1971.\n\nChikon Ali, a Rajakar from Mirpur of Kushtia was sentenced to death on 10 June 1972, which was the first ever verdict of capital punishment under the law. The punishment of Chikon Ali was later cut short by the Supreme Court to life imprisonment.\n\nAn absentia trial staged under the law gave death penalty to three Al-Badr members for the murder of prominent Professor Dr. AK Azad on 6 October 1972. The culprits were never found.\n\nOn 11 April 1972, Rajakar Abdul Hafiz of Comilla was sentenced 41 years imprisonment, highest in the history of this law. He was tried for various convictions like murder, rape, loot etc.\n\nIn the July 1972, three brothers of Bogra were given punishment as Nurul Islam of same area filed a murder case them. Mofizur Rahman aka Chan Miah was sentenced to death, Mokhlesur Rahman aka Khoka Mia and Moshiur Rahman aka Lal Miah were sentenced to life imprisonment.\nAfter appealing against their punishment Chan Miah was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment while his two brothers were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment both.\n\nKeramat Ali of Munshiganj was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment because of his activity as a Peace Committee member.\n\nA special tribunal sentenced Mokbul Hossain, Ayub Ali and Atiar Rahman to life imprisonment on the Montu murder case.\n\nAl-Badr members Siddiqur Rahman and Muhammad Galib were sentenced life imprisonment on the journalist Nizamuddin murder case.\n\nThe Collaborators Act 1972 was a flawed law with many defects. It was amended for at least three times within one year. Many criticised the law because of its defects and irregularities.\n\nThe pro-Awami League researcher Shahriar Kabir in cross examination confessed that the trials occurred under this act were never accepted by the families of the martyrs.\n\nShahin Reza, son of famous journalist Shirajuddin Hossain stated that, the trial of the collaborators was nothing but a kangaroo trial to protect the collaborators. Those who were involved in murders and genocides were set free and the innocents were imprisoned without substantial proof.\n\nKhaleque Mazumder, who killed Shahidullah Kaiser was sentenced to only a seven years imprisonment under the act. Panna Kaiser, the widow of Shahidullah Kaiser marked it as a humiliation of humanity and justice.\n\nProminent political leaders and intellectuals like Maolana Bhashani, Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish, Abul Mansur Ahmed, Justice S M Morshed, Alim AL Razy, Enayetullah Khan, Ataur Rahman Khan and many others started criticizing the law because of the abusive measures.\n\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman himself started facing problems while the process to try the collaborators begun. The Awami League leaders and activist getting order from Mujib to submit genocide data started to misusing the power. They started to use the power against their personal foes.\n\nOn the other hand, many political parties and its members were convicted of collaboration with Pakistanis. So many of them started criticising the steps taken by the government because of political benefit.\n\nThe Collaborators Act faced major legal problems as it was created in a very short time. Barrister Moinul Hossain, an Awami League backed Member of Parliament criticized the law in an article published in The Daily Ittefaq on 19 November 1972.\n\nBarrister Moinul Hossain stated:\nOn the other hand, this law had a provision in its section 7 which stated that the conviction against the criminals will come in effect only if the Officer in Charge of the Police of that particular area certify that as an offence. According to the act, No cases can be filed in the tribunal if the Officer in Charge defies.\n\nMany police officers took the side of the Pakistani Government during the Bangladesh Liberation War. And most of the families of the collaborators were enough solvent to pay a good margin to police officers. So police officers were not enough conscious about these cases.\n\nAnother defect was that the act gave the convicts an opportunity to appeal against the verdict while the victims were not given such opportunity.\n\nOn 23 July 1972 in an article published on Dainik Bangla some experts stated that,\nProminent writer Ahmed Sharif, Shahriar Kabir stated the Collaborators Act 1972 as a safeguard to the collaborators and war criminals.\n\nLater during a cross examination on 10 September 2012, Shahriar Kabir confessed that the International Crimes Tribunal Act 1973 was created to overcome the problems of the Collaborators Act 1972.\n\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman was also concerned about the failures of the Collaboration Act 1972. The call of general amnesty in 1973 was somehow influenced because of his concern about this law.\n\nThe Collaborators Act 1972, soon started to prove itself as a spiderweb. The number of big flies trapped in it were very low. Dr. Malik, Maulana Muhammad Ishaq, AKM Yousuf, Izhar Ahmed were the only big figures to be punished. Many others who were directly involved in genocide were freed or went underground.\nThe uncle of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Sheikh Mosharraf Hossain was a Rajakar. He sent him to jail. But soon many such cases started to arise.\n\nAwami Muslim League leader Rajakar Athar Ali Khan was the father of a freedom fighter from Bagerhat who attained the gallantry award Bir Uttam for his bravery. Athar Ali Khan did not face any trial because of his son.\n\nA Rajakar who later joined Bangladesh Rifles (Presently known as Border Guards Bangladesh) after liberation war remained untouched and promoted in a higher post during Sheikh Mujibur Rahman regime.\n\nTaslimuddin Ahmed, who signed the notification for the 14 collaborators asking them to surrender was himself a collaborator. Another surprising scenario was staged in a special tribunal where a Rajakar recruiting officer became the judge and gave verdict against the one whom he recruited as Rajakar. Many such situations was raised that time.\n\nThose who had close relation with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman were never tried. Mujib himself freed collaborators like Khan A Sabur, Shah Azizur Rahman, Wahiduzzaman, Mawlana Abu Zafar Mohammad Saleh, former Awami League leader AKM Shamsul Haque and many others.\n\nAfter liberation war, a committee was formed under Nilima Ibrahim to find out the collaborators who worked in Radio Pakistan. 43 people were found by the committee who worked for Pakistan. Unfortunately no action were taken against them as they were the part of progressive society as well as Awami League and some of them were killed by Pakistanis.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Firoz Salahuddin, who recruited many Rajakar and was loyal to the Pakistan Army till the end of liberation war was rehabilitated in the Bangladesh Army after the liberation war for having close relation with M. A. G. Osmani.\n\nAs the second anniversary of victory in the Bangladesh Liberation War approached, most of those jailed under the Collaborators Act had been detained for nearly two years without being charged with specific crimes. It was proving difficult to obtain sufficient evidence for prosecution. Villagers were reluctant to testify because of fear of retaliation. Also public sentiment had grown less concerned with punishing collaborators and more worried about the shattered economy. The continued imprisonment of alleged collaborators and threat of legal action against those not yet arrested was increasingly viewed as an attempt to silence political opposition. It was having the opposite effect by creating fresh social tensions.\n\nIn addition to domestic considerations, there were international ones. In August 1973, the Delhi Agreement had started the repatriation of prisoners of war, but two significant issues remained. First, Bangladesh wanted Pakistan to accept hundreds of thousands of Biharis who had remained loyal to Islamabad during the war, still considered themselves citizens of Pakistan, and didn't want to live in the now independent Bangladesh. Second, Bangladesh wanted 195 Pakistani POWs tried for war crimes. Sheik Mujib desired diplomatic recognition by Pakistan and membership in the United Nations, something China was blocking at the behest of her ally Pakistan. Bangladesh also sought more favorable relations with the oil-rich Muslim Middle East in the hope that foreign aid would be forthcoming.\n\nIn this climate, Sheik Mujib announced on 1 December 1973 a general amnesty for 36,400 alleged collaborators. The pardon did not extend to the few thousand prisoners charged with wartime murder, rape, or arson.\n\nThe declaration was depicted in the newspapers on 1 December 1973. \"Dainik Bangla\" stated the news with the headline, \"General Amnesty Declared upon the Punished Prisoners under Collaborators Act\".\nThe newspaper said,\n\nIt added that,\nAs a result of the amnesty, 21,000 prisoners were released on 17 December 1973.\n\nMany prominent collaborators were freed after the declaration gradually.\n\nKhwaja Khairuddin, who was the chief of the Peace Committee was freed from jail on 7 December 1973. Khairuddin was jailed for life by the tribunals.\n\nMuslim League leader Khan A Sabur was freed from jail on 5 December 1973.\n\nShah Azizur Rahman, Wahiduzzaman, Mawlana Abu Zafar Mohammad Saleh, former Awami League leader AKM Shamsul Haque, AKM. Yousuf, Abbas Ali Khan and many others got freed after the declaration.\n\nAmong them AKM Yousuf and Khwaja Khairuddin were sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nAfter the fall of Mujib on 15 August 1972 and unfortunate killing of four top leaders from Bangladesh Awami League, an ordinance was declared which halted the activity under this act. Later on President Abu Sadat Mohammad Sayem repealed the act on 31 December 1975. This gave the lackeys of Pakistani occupational force a complete legal protection from farther facing any kind of trial.\n\nWhereas it is expedient to repeal the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 (P.O. No. 8 of 1972), and to provide for certain matters ancillary thereto;\n\nNow, Therefore, in pursuance of the Proclamations of 20 August 1975, and 8 November 1975, and in exercise of all powers enabling him in that behalf, the President is pleased to make and promulgate the following Ordinance:-\n\n1. This Ordinance may be called the Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) (Repeal) Ordinance, 1975.\n2. # (1) The Bangladesh Collaborators (Special Tribunals) Order, 1972 (P.O. No. 8 of 1972), hereinafter referred to as the said Order, is hereby repealed.\n\n"}

{"id": "24522548", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24522548", "title": "Depression of 1882–85", "text": "Depression of 1882–85\n\nThe Depression of 1882–85 or Recession of 1882–85 was an economic contraction in the United States that lasted from March 1882 to May 1885, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. At 38 months in length this is the third-longest recession in the NBER's chronology of business cycles from 1854 to present. Only the Great Depression of 1929-1941 and the Long Depression of 1873–79 were longer.\n\nThe Depression of 1882-85 was not inaugurated by financial disaster or mass panic, but was rather an economic downturn that came about through a protracted and gradual process. The downturn was preceded by a period of prosperity over the years 1879 to 1882, a growth powered by expansion of the American railroad industry and the opening of economic opportunities associated with the development of the transportation system. During this interval annual railroad construction quadrupled, growing from 2,665 miles (4,289 km) in 1878 to 11,569 miles (18,619 km) in 1882. According to one 1997 estimate, the expansion of this sector represented a full 15% of American capital formation during the decade of the 1880s.\n\nIn addition, the United States experienced a favorable international balance of trade during the 1879-1882 period of growth — a fact which had the effect of expanding the country's money supply, facilitating credit and investment.\n\nIn 1882 this trend reversed, resulting in a decline in railroad construction and a decline in related industries, particularly iron and steel. Mismanagement and rate wars negatively affected profitability and the luster of railroads as an investment was dulled; money dried up and construction of new lines was negatively impacted, falling from 11,569 miles in 1882 to 6,741 miles in 1883.\n\nA major economic event during the recession was the Panic of 1884.\n\nThe 1884 downturn was severe with an estimated 5% of all American factories and mines completely shuttered during the 12 months running from July 1, 1884, to July 1, 1885. In addition another 5% of such enterprises were said to have closed down for part of the year. Approximately 1 million American workers were out of work during this economic trough.\n\nLike the Long Depression that preceded it, the Depression of 1882–85 was more of a price depression than a production depression — in that prices and wage rates contracted while gross output remained more or less constant. \n\nContemporary observers were baffled by the downturn and agents of the fledgling U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducted extensive surveys on the matter. In a published report by Commissioner of Labor Carroll D. Wright, it was found that explanation of the 1882 depression varied greatly according to the profession of the observer, with bankers and merchants tending to blame financial or commercial reasons, members of the clergy tending to blame social causes combined with divine providence, manufacturers apt to blame regulatory causes and the wage demands of workers, and workers tending to identify overproduction due to the introduction of new labor-saving machinery and low wage levels that made it impossible to consume the full amount of output.\n\nA lengthy alphabetical list of causes claimed by survey respondents was compiled by the Bureau, which included, among other proposed factors, defects in the banking system, place of credit in agriculture, the use of child labor, the negative effects of corporate monopoly, a lack of public confidence in the future of the economy, expansion of the role of silver in the money system due to an unequal price ratio between gold and silver, excessive immigration, the expanded use of labor-saving machinery, a growth of speculative investment and market manipulation, the decline of railway construction, negative effects of a high tariff policy, and the growing consolidation of wealth in the hands of a comparative few.\n\nEconomic data from the era are very spotty. Much of what is known comes from the reporting of the business newspaper the \"Commercial & Financial Chronicle\". In terms of severity, according to Victor Zarnowitz, indexes of business activity show that the recession was not as severe as the declines in 1873, 1893, and 1921, but was more severe than the other recessions between the American Civil War and the Great Depression. At 38 months in length this is the third-longest recession in the NBER's chronology of business cycles from 1854 to present. Only the Great Depression and Long Depression of 1873–79 are longer.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1336960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1336960", "title": "Failure rate", "text": "Failure rate\n\nFailure rate is the frequency with which an engineered system or component fails, expressed in failures per unit of time. It is often denoted by the Greek letter λ (lambda) and is highly used in reliability engineering.\n\nThe failure rate of a system usually depends on time, with the rate varying over the life cycle of the system. For example, an automobile's failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service. One does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe, overhaul the brakes, or have major transmission problems in a new vehicle.\n\nIn practice, the mean time between failures (MTBF, 1/λ) is often reported instead of the failure rate. This is valid and useful if the failure rate may be assumed constant – often used for complex units / systems, electronics – and is a general agreement in some reliability standards (Military and Aerospace). It does in this case \"only\" relate to the flat region of the bathtub curve, which is also called the \"useful life period\". Because of this, it is incorrect to extrapolate MTBF to give an estimate of the service lifetime of a component, which will typically be much less than suggested by the MTBF due to the much higher failure rates in the \"end-of-life wearout\" part of the \"bathtub curve\".\n\nThe reason for the preferred use for MTBF numbers is that the use of large positive numbers (such as 2000 hours) is more intuitive and easier to remember than very small numbers (such as 0.0005 per hour).\n\nThe MTBF is an important system parameter in systems where failure rate needs to be managed, in particular for safety systems. The MTBF appears frequently in the engineering design requirements, and governs frequency of required system maintenance and inspections. In special processes called renewal processes, where the time to recover from failure can be neglected and the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time, the failure rate is simply the multiplicative inverse of the MTBF (1/λ).\n\nA similar ratio used in the transport industries, especially in railways and trucking is \"mean distance between failures\", a variation which attempts to correlate actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices.\n\nFailure rates are important factors in the insurance, finance, commerce and regulatory industries and fundamental to the design of safe systems in a wide variety of applications.\n\nThe failure rate can be defined as the following:\n\nAlthough the failure rate, formula_1, is often thought of as the probability that a failure occurs in a specified interval given no failure before time formula_2, it is not actually a probability because it can exceed 1. Erroneous expression of the failure rate in % could result in incorrect perception of the measure, especially if it would be measured from repairable systems and multiple systems with non-constant failure rates or different operation times. It can be defined with the aid of the reliability function, also called the survival function, formula_3, the probability of no failure before time formula_2.\n\nover a time interval formula_9 from formula_10 (or formula_2) to formula_12 and formula_13 is defined as formula_9. Note that this is a conditional probability, where the condition is that the failure has not occurred at time formula_2. Hence the formula_3 in the denominator.\n\nHazard rate and ROCOF (rate of occurrence of failures) are often incorrectly seen as the same and equal to the failure rate. To clarify; the more promptly items are repaired, the sooner they will break again, so the higher the ROCOF. The hazard rate is however independent of the time to repair and of the logistic delay time.\n\nCalculating the failure rate for ever smaller intervals of time, results in the (also called hazard rate), formula_17. This becomes the \"instantaneous\" failure rate as formula_18 tends to zero:\n\nA continuous failure rate depends on the existence of a failure distribution, formula_20, which is a cumulative distribution function that describes the probability of failure (at least) up to and including time \"t\",\n\nwhere formula_22 is the failure time.\nThe failure distribution function is the integral of the failure \"density\" function, \"f\"(\"t\"),\n\nThe hazard function can be defined now as\n\nMany probability distributions can be used to model the failure distribution (\"see List of important probability distributions\"). A common model is the exponential failure distribution,\n\nwhich is based on the exponential density function. The hazard rate function for this is:\n\nThus, for an exponential failure distribution, the hazard rate is a constant with respect to time (that is, the distribution is \"memory-less\"). For other distributions, such as a Weibull distribution or a log-normal distribution, the hazard function may not be constant with respect to time. For some such as the deterministic distribution it is monotonic increasing (analogous to \"wearing out\"), for others such as the Pareto distribution it is monotonic decreasing (analogous to \"burning in\"), while for many it is not monotonic.\n\nA decreasing failure rate (DFR) describes a phenomenon where the probability of an event in a fixed time interval in the future decreases over time. A decreasing failure rate can describe a period of \"infant mortality\" where earlier failures are eliminated or corrected and corresponds to the situation where λ(\"t\") is a decreasing function.\n\nMixtures of DFR variables are DFR. Mixtures of exponentially distributed random variables are hyperexponentially distributed.\n\nFor a renewal process with DFR renewal function, inter-renewal times are concave. Brown conjectured the converse, that DFR is also necessary for the inter-renewal times to be concave, however it has been shown that this conjecture holds neither in the discrete case nor in the continuous case.\n\nIncreasing failure rate is an intuitive concept caused by components wearing out. Decreasing failure rate describes a system which improves with age.\nDecreasing failure rates have been found in the lifetimes of spacecraft, Baker and Baker commenting that \"those spacecraft that last, last on and on.\" The reliability of aircraft air conditioning systems were individually found to have an exponential distribution, and thus in the pooled population a DFR.\n\nWhen the failure rate is decreasing the coefficient of variation is ⩾ 1, and when the failure rate is increasing the coefficient of variation is ⩽ 1. Note that this result only holds when the failure rate is defined for all t ⩾ 0 and that the converse result (coefficient of variation determining nature of failure rate) does not hold.\n\nFailure rate data can be obtained in several ways. The most common means are:\n\nFailure rates can be expressed using any measure of time, but hours is the most common unit in practice. Other units, such as miles, revolutions, etc., can also be used in place of \"time\" units.\n\nFailure rates are often expressed in engineering notation as failures per million, or 10, especially for individual components, since their failure rates are often very low.\n\nThe Failures In Time (FIT) rate of a device is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (10) device-hours of operation.\n(E.g. 1000 devices for 1 million hours, or 1 million devices for 1000 hours each, or some other combination.) This term is used particularly by the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe relationship of FIT to MTBF may be expressed as: MTBF = 1,000,000,000 x 1/FIT.\n\nUnder certain engineering assumptions (e.g. besides the above assumptions for a constant failure rate, the assumption that the considered system has no relevant redundancies), the failure rate for a complex system is simply the sum of the individual failure rates of its components, as long as the units are consistent, e.g. failures per million hours. This permits testing of individual components or subsystems, whose failure rates are then added to obtain the total system failure rate.\n\nAdding \"redundant\" components to eliminate a single point of failure improves the mission failure rate, but makes the series failure rate (also called the logistics failure rate) worse—the extra components improve the mean time between critical failures (MTBCF), even though the mean time before something fails is worse.\n\nSuppose it is desired to estimate the failure rate of a certain component. A test can be performed to estimate its failure rate. Ten identical components are each tested until they either fail or reach 1000 hours, at which time the test is terminated for that component. (The level of statistical confidence is not considered in this example.) The results are as follows:\n\nEstimated failure rate is\n\nor 799.8 failures for every million hours of operation.\n\nThe Nelson–Aalen estimator can be used to estimate the cumulative hazard rate function.\n\n\n"}

It was the result of the conquest of the region in 1406 to 1407. The previous periods of Chinese rules, collectively known as the Bắc thuộc periods in Vietnam, were longer-lasting, constituting much of Vietnam's history from 111 BC to 939 AD. The fourth Chinese occupation of Vietnam was eventually ended with the establishment of the Lê dynasty.\n\nThe former ruling dynasty of Đại Việt, the Trần, had relations with the Yuan and Ming Empire as a tributary. However, in 1400, Hồ Quý Ly deposed and massacred the Trần house before usurping the throne. After taking the throne, Hồ renamed the country from Dai Viet to Dai Ngu. In 1402, he abdicated the throne in favor of his son, Hồ Hán Thương (胡漢蒼).\n\nIn October 1404, Trần Thiêm Bình (陳添平) arrived at the Ming imperial court in Nanjing, claiming to be a Trần prince. He notified the court of the treacherous events that had taken place and appealed to the court for the restoration of his throne.\n\nThe Yongle Emperor of the Ming Empire issued an edict reprimanding the usurper and demanding the restoration of the Tran throne, a pretext to the annexation of Vietnam. As the party crossed the border into Lạng Sơn, Hồ's forces ambushed them and killed the Trần prince that the Ming convoy were escorting back.\n\nIn the winter of 1406, the Ming armies began their invasion. Zhang Fu and Mu Sheng departed from Guangxi and Yunnan respectively to launch a pincer attack into enemy territory. On 19 November 1406, they captured the two capitals and other important cities in the Red River Delta. Hồ Quý Ly and his son were captured on 16 June 1407, they were caged and brought as prisoners to the Yongle Emperor in Nanjing.\n\nThere was several revolts among the Vietnamese people against the Ming authorities, only to be crushed by the Ming army. Among the people who led the rebellion were, Trần Ngỗi (revolted 1407–09), a young son of the late Trần emperor Trần Nghệ Tông and Trần Quý Khoáng, a nephew. These revolts were short-lived and poorly planned but they helped lay some of the groundwork for Lê Lợi's war for independence.\n\nLê Lợi, one of Vietnam's most celebrated heroes, is credited with rescuing the country from Ming domination in 1428. Born of a wealthy landowning family, he served as a senior scholar-official until the advent of the Ming, whom he refused to serve. After a decade of gathering a resistance movement around him, Le Loi and his forces finally defeated the Ming army in 1428. Rather than putting to death the captured Ming soldiers and administrators, he magnanimously provided ships and supplies to send them back to China. Le Loi then ascended the Vietnamese throne, taking the reign name Lê Thái Tổ and establishing the Lê dynasty (1428–1788).\n\nWhen the Ming invaded; all classical Vietnamese printing blocks, books and materials were burned and suppressed. Vietnamese records like gazettes, maps, and registers were instructed to be burned, saved for one copy.\n\nThis policy was strictly enforced by Yongle emperor. His command to the army in Vietnam in July 1406 is as follow:\n\n兵入。除釋道經板經文不燬。外一切書板文字以至俚俗童蒙所習。如上大人丘乙已之類。片紙隻字悉皆燬之。其境內中國所立碑刻則存之。但是安南所立者悉壞之。一字不存。\n\n\"Once our army enter Annam (Vietnam currently), except Buddhist and Taoist text; all books and notes, including folklore and children book, should be burnt. The stelas erected by China should be protected carefully, while those erected by Annamese (Vietnamese currently), should be completely annihilated, do not spare even one character.\"\n\nYongle's command on 21 May 1407 read:\n\n\"I have repeatedly told you all to burnt all Annamese books, including folklore and children books and the local stelas should be destroyed immediately upon sight. Recently I heard our soldiers hesitated and read those books before burning them. Most soldiers do not know how to read, if this policy is adapted widely, it will be a waste of our time. Now you have to strictly obey my previous command, and burnt all local books upon sight, without hesitation.\"\n\nFor this reason almost no vernacular chữ nôm texts survive from before the Ming invasion. Various ancient sites such as pagoda Bao Minh were looted and destroyed. The Ming dynasty applied various Sinicization policies to spread more Chinese culture in the occupied nation.\n\nThe Ming government began a harsh rule of both colonization and sinicization. Valuable artifacts such as gems, jade, gold, pieces of art as well as craftsmen were transported to China. The Chinese had greatly encouraged the development and the use of gold and silver mines. But right after the silver and gold were extracted they impounded them and sent a fraction of these minerals to Beijing. They also imposed salt taxes, but a slightly heavier tax against those who produced salt in Annam.\n\nNon-Han ethnic minorities fought in the Chinese army against the Ho. It was instructed that the Ming army should free foreign prisoners who were jailed in Vietnam.\n\nTo keep the people under control in Vietnam, the Ming government issued, and utilized the \"So Ho\" system, (literally meaning \"Family Book\") at the lowest village community level. Whenever there was a change in a family, a change in the book was recorded and approved. Based on this information, they created a systematic military service enrollment process for all young men deemed fit enough to serve in the future for the Imperial Chinese Army. This process was no different than what other governments did to subjugated areas, nonetheless, this had created a negative feeling against the Chinese government.\nIn addition, many talented Vietnamese individuals with varying trades and backgrounds who could make significant contributions were allowed to become government officials in China where they served in the Chinese imperial government.\n\nThe Ming's ethnic Vietnamese collaborators included Mac Thuy whose grandfather was Mạc Đĩnh Chi who was a direct ancestor of Mạc Đăng Dung.\n\nVietnam received firearms from Ming dynasty rule over Vietnam.\n\nThe conquest of Champa was enabled when Vietnam's north received gunpowder weapons from the Ming dynasty along with Neo-Confucianist thought.\n\nIt was recorded that the union of Vietnamese women and Chinese (Ngô) men produced offspring which were left behind in Vietnam, and the Chams, Cẩu Hiểm, Laotians, these people, and Vietnamese natives who collaborated with the Ming were made into slaves of the Le government in the Complete Annals of Đại Việt.\n\nThere was no mandatory required reparation of the voluntarily remaining Ming Chinese in Vietnam. The return of the Ming Chinese to China was commanded by the Ming and not Le Loi. The Trai made up the supporters of Le Loi in his campaign. He lived among the Trai at the border regions as their leader and seized the Ming ruled lowland Kinh areas after originally forming his base in the southern highland regions. The southern dwelling Trai and Red River dwelling Vietnamese were in effect locked in a \"civil war\" during the anti Ming rebellion by Le Loi.\n\nThe leader Lưu Bác Công (Liu Bogong) in 1437 commanded a Dai Viet military squad made out of ethnic Chinese since even after the independence of Dai Viet, Chinese remained behind. Vietnam received Chinese defectors from Yunnan in the 1400s.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37364686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37364686", "title": "Georgian–Seljuk wars", "text": "Georgian–Seljuk wars\n\nGeorgian–Seljuk wars, also known as Georgian Reconquista is a long series of battles and military clashes that took place from 1048 until 1213, between the Kingdom of Georgia and the different Seljuqid states that occupied most of Transcaucasia. The conflict is preceded by deadly raids in the Caucasus by the Turks in the 11th century, known in Georgian historiography as the Great Turkish Invasion.\n\nIn 1048-9, the Seljuk Turks under Ibrahim Yinal made their first incursion in Byzantine frontier region of Iberia. The emperor Constantine IX requested help from the Georgian duke of Liparit IV of Kldekari, whom the Byzantines had aided in his struggle against the Georgian king Bagrat IV. Liparit, who had been fighting on the Byzantine side, was captured at the Battle of Kapetron. Bagrat took advantage of this, and acquired his possessions. \n\nAlthough the Byzantine Empire and Georgia had centuries-long cultural and religious ties, and the Seljuqs posed a substantial threat to the empire itself, Constantinople’s aggressiveness on the Caucasian political scene contributed to an atmosphere of distrust and recrimination, and prevented the two Christian nations from effective cooperation against the common threat. With assertion of the Georgian Bagratid hegemony in the Caucasus being the cornerstone of Bagrat’s reign, his policy can be understood as the attempt to play the Seljuqs and Byzantines off against one another.\n\nThe second half of the 11th century was marked by the strategically significant invasion of the Seljuq Turks, who by the end of the 1040s had succeeded in building a vast empire including most of Central Asia and Persia. The Seljuqs made their first appearances in Georgia in the 1060s, when the Sultan Alp Arslan laid waste to the south-western provinces of the Georgian kingdom and reduced Kakheti. These intruders were part of the same wave of the Turkish movement which inflicted a crushing defeat on the Byzantine army at Manzikert in 1071. \n\nThe Seljuk threat prompted the Georgian and Byzantine governments to seek a closer cooperation. To secure the alliance, Bagrat’s daughter Maria married, at some point between 1066 and 1071, to the Byzantine co-emperor Michael VII Ducas. The choice of a Georgian princess was unprecedented, and it was seen in Georgia as a diplomatic success on Bagrat's side.\n\nOn 10 December 1068, Alp Arslan, dissatisfied with the act of the last Caucasian monarch that he had not yet submitted, accompanied by the kings of Lorri and Kakheti as well as the emir of Tbilisi marched against Bagrat again. The provinces of Kartli and Argveti were occupied and pillaged. Bagrat’s long-time rivals, the Shaddadids of Arran, were given compensation: the fortresses of Tbilisi and Rustavi. As soon as Alp Arslan left Georgia, Bagrat recovered Kartli in July 1068. Al-Fadl I b. Muhammad, of the Shaddadids, encamped at Isani (a suburb of Tbilisi on the left bank of the Kura) and with 33,000 men ravaged the countryside. Bagrat defeated him, however, and forced the Shaddadid troops to flight. On the road through Kakheti, Fadl was taken prisoner by the local ruler Aghsartan. At the price of conceding several fortresses on the Iori River, Bagrat ransomed Fadl and received from him the surrender of Tbilisi where he reinstated a local emir on the terms of vassalage.\n\nThe last years of Bagrat's reign coincided with what Professor David Marshall Lang described as \"the final débacle of eastern Christendom\" — the Battle of Manzikert — in which Alp Arslan dealt a crushing defeat to the Byzantine army, capturing the emperor Romanos IV, who soon died in misery. Bagrat IV died the following year, on 24 November 1072, and was buried at the Chkondidi Monastery. The suzerainty over the troubled kingdom of Georgia passed to his son George II. Georgians were able to recover theme of Iberia, by the help of Byzantine governor, Gregory Pakourianos, who began to evacuate the region shortly after the disaster inflicted by the Seljuks on the Byzantine army at Manzikert. On this occasion, George II of Georgia was bestowed with the Byzantine title of \"Caesar\", granted the fortress of Kars and put in charge of the Imperial Eastern limits.\n\nAlthough the Georgians were able to recover from Alp Arslan's invasion, the Byzantine withdrawal from Anatolia brought them in more direct contact with the Seljuqs. In the 1070s, Georgia was twice attacked by the Sultan Malik Shah I, but the Georgian King George II was still able to fight back at times. In 1076 Malik Shah surged into Georgia and reduced many settlements to ruins, from 1079/80 onward, George was pressured into submitting to Malik-Shah to ensure a precious degree of peace at the price of an annual tribute. George's acceptance of the Seljuq suzerainty did not bring a real peace for Georgia. The Turks continued their seasonal movement into the Georgian territory to make use of the rich herbage of the Kura valley and the Seljuq garrisons occupied the key fortresses in Georgia's south. These inroads and settlements had a ruinous effect on Georgia's economic and political order. Cultivated lands were turned into pastures for the nomads and peasant farmers were compelled to seek safety in the mountains. \n\nGeorge II was able to garner the Seljuk military support in his campaign aimed at bringing the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kakheti, which had long resisted the Bagratid attempts of annexation. However, tired with a protracted siege of the Kakhetian stronghold of Vezhini, George abandoned the campaign when snow fell. The Seljuk auxiliaries also lifted the siege and plundered the fertile Iori Valley in Kakheti. Aghsartan I, king of Kakheti, went to the sultan to declare his submission, and in token of loyalty embraced Islam, thus winning a Seljuk protection against the aspirations of the Georgian crown.\n\nGeorge II’s wavering character and incompetent political decisions coupled with the Seljuk yoke brought the Kingdom of Georgia into a profound crisis which climaxed in the aftermath of a disastrous earthquake that struck Georgia in 1088.\n\nWatching his kingdom slip into chaos, George II ceded the crown to his 16-year-old son David IV in 1089. King David IV proved to be a capable statesman and military commander. As he came of age under the guidance of his court minister, George of Chqondidi, David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized the power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1089–1100, he organized small detachments to harass and destroy isolated Seljuk troops and began the resettlement of desolate regions. By 1099 David IV's power was considerable enough that he was able to refuse paying tribute to Seljuqs. In 1104 David’s supporters in the eastern Georgian province of Kakheti, nobles: Baramisdze and Arshiani captured the local king Aghsartan II (1102–1104), a loyal tributary of the Seljuk Sultan Barkiyaruq (c.1092-1105), and reunited the area with the rest of Georgia. Following the annexation of Kakheti, in 1105, David routed a Seljuk punitive force at the Battle of Ertsukhi, leading to momentum that helped him to secure the key fortresses of Samshvilde, Rustavi, Gishi, and Lori between 1110 and 1118.To strengthen his army, King David launched a major military reform in 1118–1120 and resettled several thousand Kipchaks from the northern steppes to frontier districts of Georgia. In return, the Kipchaks provided one soldier per family, allowing King David to establish a standing army in addition to his royal troops (known as Monaspa). The new army provided the king with a much-needed force to fight both external threats and internal discontent of powerful lords. The Georgian-Kipchak alliance was facilitated by David's earlier marriage to the Khan's daughter. Starting in 1120, King David began a more aggressive policy of expansion. He entered the neighbouring Shirvan and took the town of Qabala. In the winter of 1120–1121 the Georgian troops successfully attacked the Seljuk settlements on the eastern and southwestern approaches to the Transcaucasus. Muslim powers became increasingly concerned about the rapid rise of a Christian state in southern Caucasia. In 1121, Sultan Mahmud b. Muhammad ( 1118–1131) declared a holy war on Georgia. However, 12 August 1121, King David routed the enemy army on the fields of Didgori, with fleeing Seljuq Turks being run down by pursuing Georgian cavalry for several days. A huge amount of booty and prisoners were captured by David's army, which had also secured Tbilisi, the last Muslim enclave remaining from the Arab occupation, in 1122 and moved the Georgian capital there and inaugurated Georgia's Golden Age.In 1123, David’s army liberated Dmanisi, the last Seljuk stronghold in southern Georgia. In 1124, David finally conquered Shirvan and took the Armenian city of Ani from the Muslim emirs, thus expanding the borders of his kingdom to the Araxes basin. Armenians met him as a liberator providing some auxiliary force for his army.\n\nThe kingdom continued to flourish under Demetrius I, the son of David. Although his reign saw a disruptive family conflict related to royal succession, Georgia remained a centralized power with a strong military. As soon as, he ascended to the throne, the neighbouring Muslim rulers began attacking Georgia from all sides. The Seljuqid sultans fought to restore the rule of the Shirvanshahs. Shirvan's large Muslim population rose against Georgia. This probably happened in 1129 or 1130, when Demetrius restored the Shirvanshahs to power in Shirvan, installing on the throne Manuchihr II, the husband of his daughter Rusudan. Shirvanshahs had to provide the Georgian king with troops whenever the latter demanded it.\n\nIn 1130 Georgia was attacked by the Sultan of Ahlat, Shah-Armen Sökmen II (1128-1183). This war was started by the passage of Ani into the hands of the Georgians; Demetrius I had to compromise and give up Ani to Fadl ibn Mahmud on terms of vassalage and inviolability of the Christian churches. In 1139, Demetrius raided the city of Ganja in Arran. He brought the iron gate of the defeated city to Georgia and donated it to Gelati Monastery at Kutaisi. Despite this brilliant victory, Demetrius could hold Ganja only for a few years. In reply to this, the sultan of Eldiguzids attacked Ganja several times, and in 1143 the town again jell to the sultan. According to Mkhitar Gosh, Demetrius ultimately gained possession of Ganja, but, when he gave his daughter in marriage to the sultan, he presented the latter with the town as dowry, and the sultain appointed his own emir to rule it.\n\nFadl's successor, Fakr al-Din Shaddad, a Shaddadid emir of Ani asked for Saltuk's daughter's hand, however Saltuk refused him. This caused a deep hatred in Shaddad towards Saltuk. In 1154 he planned a plot and formed a secret alliance with the Demetrius I. While a Georgian army waited in ambush, he offered tribute to Saltukids, ruler of Erzerum and asked the latter to acccept him as a vassal. In 1153-1154 Emir Saltuk II marched on Ani, but Shaddad informed his suzerain, the King of Georgia, of this. Demetrius marched to Ani, defeated and captured the emir. At the request of neighbouring Muslim rulers and released him for a ransom of 100,000 dinars, paid by Saltuk's sons in law and Saltuk swore not to fight against the Georgians he returned home.\n\nDemetrius was succeeded by his son George III in 1156, beginning a stage of more offensive foreign policy. The same year he ascended to the throne, George launched a successful campaign against the Shah-Armens. It may be said that the Shah-Armen took part in almost all the campaigns undertaken against Georgia between 1130s to 1160s. Moreover, Shah-Armens enlisted the assistance of Georgian feudals disaffected with the Georgian monarchs and gave them asylum. In 1156 the Ani's Christian population rose against the emir Fakr al-Din Shaddad, and turned the town over to his brother Fadl ibn Mahmud. But Fadl, too, apparently could not satisfy the people of Ani, and this time the town was offered to the George III, who took advantage of this offer and subjugated Ani, appointing his general Ivane Orbeli as its ruler in 1161. \n\nA coalition consisting of the ruler of Ahlat, Shah-Armen Sökmen II, the ruler of Diyarbekir, Kotb ad-Din il-Ghazi, Al-Malik of Erzerum, and others was formed as soon as the Georgians seized the town, but the latter defeated the allies. He then marched against one of the members of the coalition, the king of Erzerum, and in the same year, 1161, defeated and made him prisoner, but then released him for a large ransom. The capture of Ani and the defeat of the Saltukid-forces enabled the Georgian king to march on Dvin. The following year in August/September 1162, Dvin was temporarily occupied and sacked, the non-Christian population was pillaged and the Georgian troops returned home loaded with booty. The king appointed Ananiya, a member of the local feudal nobility to govern the town. \n\nA coalition of Muslim rulers led by Shams al-Din Eldiguz, ruler of Adarbadagan and some other regions, embarked upon a campaign against Georgia in early 1163. He was joined by the Shah-Armen Sökmen II, Ak-Sunkur, ruler of Maragha, and others. With an army of 50,000 troops they marched on Georgia. The Georgian army was defeated. The enemy took the fortress of Gagi, laid waste as far as the region of Gagi and Gegharkunik, seized prisoners and booty, and then moved to Ani. The Muslim rulers were jubilant, and they prepared for a new campaign. However, this time they were forestalled by George III, who marched into Arran at the beginning of 1166, occupied a region extending to Ganja, devastated the land and turn back with prisoners and booty.\n\nThere seemed to be no end to the war between George III and atabeg Eldiguz. But the belligerents were exhausted to such an extent that Eldiguz proposed an armistice. George had no choice but to make peace. He restored Ani to its former rulers, the Shaddadids, who became his vassals. The Shaddadids, ruled the town for about 10 years, but in 1174 King George took the Shahanshah ibn Mahmud as a prisoner and occupied Ani once again. Ivane Orbeli, was appointed governor of the town.\n\nIn 1177 George III faced the revolt of House of Orbeli. Ivane decided to request aid from neighbouring kingdoms. In particular, they requested aid from Shah-Armens and Eldiguzids, but no assistance was forthcoming. George III was able to crush the revolt and embarked on a crackdown campaign on the defiant aristocratic clans; Ivane Orbeli was put to death and the surviving members of his family were driven out of Georgia. Sargis I Mkhargrdzeli was appointed as a governor of Ani. In 1178, George III appointed his daughter and heiress Tamar as heir apparent and co-ruler to forestall any dispute after his death. However, he remained co-regent until his death in 1184.\n\nThe successes of his predecessors were built upon by Queen Tamar, daughter of George III, who became the first female ruler of Georgia in her own right and under whose leadership the Georgian state reached the zenith of power and prestige in the Middle Ages. Tamar was successful in neutralizing this opposition and embarked on an energetic foreign policy aided by the decline of the hostile Seljuq Turks. Relying on a powerful military élite, Tamar was able to build an empire which dominated the Caucasus until its collapse under the Mongol attacks within two decades after Tamar's death.\n\nOnce Tamar succeeded in consolidating her power and found a reliable support in David Soslan, the Mkhargrdzeli, Toreli, and other noble families, she revived the expansionist foreign policy of her predecessors. Repeated occasions of dynastic strife in Georgia combined with the efforts of regional successors of the Great Seljuq Empire, such as the Eldiguzids, Shirvanshahs, and the Ahlatshahs, had slowed down the dynamic of the Georgians achieved during the reigns of Tamar's great-grandfather, David IV, and her father, George III. However, the Georgians became again active under Tamar, more prominently in the second decade of her rule.\n\nEarly in the 1190s, the Georgian government began to interfere in the affairs of the Eldiguzids and of the Shirvanshahs, aiding rivaling local princes and reducing Shirvan to a tributary state. The Eldiguzid atabeg Abu Bakr attempted to stem the Georgian advance, but suffered a defeat at the hands of David Soslan at the Battle of Shamkor and lost his capital to a Georgian protégé in 1195. Although Abu Bakr was able to resume his reign a year later, the Eldiguzids were only barely able to contain further Georgian forays.\n\nThe question of liberation of Armenia remained of prime importance in Georgia's foreign policy. Tamar's armies led by two Christianised Kurdish generals, Zakare and Ivane Mkhargrdzeli overran fortresses and cities towards the Ararat Plain, reclaiming one after another fortresses and districts from local Muslim rulers.Alarmed by the Georgian successes, Süleymanshah II, the resurgent Seljuqid sultan of Rûm, rallied his vassal emirs and marched against Georgia, but his camp was attacked and destroyed by David Soslan at the Battle of Basian in 1203 or 1204. The chronicler of Tamar describes how the army was assembled at the rock-hewn town of Vardzia before marching on to Basian and how the queen addressed the troops from the balcony of the church. Exploiting her success in this battle, between 1203-1205 Georgians seized the town of Dvin and entered Akhlatshah possessions twice and subdued the emir of Kars (vassal of the Saltukids in Erzurum), Akhlatshahs, the emirs of Erzurum and Erzincan.\n\nIn 1206 the Georgian army, under the command of David Soslan, captured Kars and other fortresses and strongholds along the Araxes. This campaign was evidently started because the ruler of Erzerum refused to submit to Georgia. The emir of Kars requested aid from the Akhlatshahs, but the latter was unable to respond, it was soon taken over by the Ayyubid Sultanate In 1207.In 1209, the brothers Mkhargrzeli laid waste to Ardabil – according to the Georgian and Armenian annals – as a revenge for the local Muslim ruler's attack on Ani and his massacre of the city's Christian population. In a great final burst, the brothers led an army marshaled throughout Tamar's possessions and vassal territories in a march, through Nakhchivan and Julfa, to Marand, Tabriz, and Qazvin in northwest Iran, pillaging several settlements on their way. Georgians reached countries where nobody had heard of either their name or existence. These victories brought Georgia to the summit of its power and glory, establishing a pan-Caucasian Empire that extended from the Black Sea to the Caspian and from the Caucasus Mountains to Lake Van.\n\nGeorge IV continued Tamar's policy. He put down the revolts in neighbouring Muslim vassal states in the 1210s and began preparations for a large-scale campaign against Jerusalem to support the Crusaders in 1220. However, the Mongols approach to the Georgian borders made the Crusade plan unrealistic. The first Mongol expedition defeated Georgian armies in 1221–1222. George IV died fighting them in 1223 and his sister Rusudan made a desperate alliance against Mongols when she and her daughter Tamar married to Seljuk princes of Erzurum and Sultanate of Rum. The former enemies were now the closest allies (Battle of Köse Dağ) but that did not prevent the Mongol advance. \n\n"}

The festival is held on and around Eastwood Oval on the third Saturday of October to commemorate 19th-century pioneer Maria Ann \"Granny\" Smith, credited with producing the Granny Smith apple and celebrated for providing the Ryde-Hunters Hill area with prosperity. The festival begins at 9:00 am and concludes at 8:30 pm.\n\nThe highlights are the Grand Parade down Rowe Street and the fireworks display. There are also stalls, community events, live entertainment, and rides. It is a festival tradition that the New South Wales Mounted Police lead the Grand Parade.\n\nThe Granny Smith Festival in 2007 was of particular significance, in that it became a major campaign venue for the Australian federal election, 2007. For the first time in the Festival's 22-year history, it was officially opened by the (then) local Member of Parliament, Prime Minister John Howard. There were speculations that his appearance was largely due to the emergence of a serious challenge towards not just his Coalition government, but indeed his very own parliamentary seat of Bennelong, from high-profile ALP candidate Maxine McKew. Apart from Howard and McKew, a number of other local politicians, along with hundreds of volunteers representing numerous political parties and interest groups, attended the Festival, with a large contingent of media crew following their campaign trails.\n\nThe 2008 Granny Smith Festival was of important significance with the Ryde by-election being held on the same day, Saturday October 18. This was triggered by the resignation of John Watkins who was the MP for Ryde since 1995. An estimated 280 stores were set up in the 2008 event.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4567074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4567074", "title": "Illegal emigration", "text": "Illegal emigration\n\nIllegal emigration refers to a person moving across national borders in a way that violates emigration laws. Such a person may legally go abroad and refuse to return when demanded by the country of origin.\n\nSpecial cases are when one flees a country as a refugee escaping persecution or, after committing a crime, trying to escape prosecution. However, a person who enters another country as an illegal immigrant may be sent back, and if a criminal, a person may face extradition or prosecution in the other country.\n\nThe position of the United Nations is that freedom to emigrate is a human right, part of the right to freedom of movement. According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \"Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country\".\n\nWhile illegal emigration is a concept at least as old as the North American colonies, a Freedom of movement policy has appeared at least in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nThe Russian Republic implemented emigration restrictions two months after the Russian Revolution of 1917, with the various Soviet Socialist Republics of the Soviet Union thereafter banning emigration. After the creation of the Eastern Bloc from countries occupied by the Soviet Union during World War II, Eastern Bloc countries instituted emigration bans similar to those in the Soviet Union. After the erection of the Berlin Wall in 1961, emigration except for ethnic migration reasons mostly halted from east-to-west. A few thousand escape attempts from East Germany occurred, including those by defecting border guards. (More generally, escape by any citizen was considered defection.)\n\nSoviet Emigration and any travel abroad were not allowed without an explicit permission from the government and KGB. People who were not allowed to leave the country are known as \"refuseniks\". During the final stages of World War II, the Soviet Union began the creation of the Eastern Bloc by directly annexing several countries as Soviet Socialist Republics; these were effectively ceded to it by Nazi Germany in the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. These included Eastern Poland (incorporated into two different SSRs), Latvia (became Latvia SSR), Estonia (became Estonian SSR), Lithuania (became Lithuania SSR), part of eastern Finland (became Karelo-Finnish SSR) and northern Romania (became the Moldavian SSR). Other states were converted into Soviet Satellite states, such as the People's Republic of Poland, the People's Republic of Hungary, the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the People's Republic of Romania, the People's Republic of Albania, and later East Germany from the Soviet zone of German occupation.\n\nBy the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc (along with China, Mongolia and North Korea). Up until 1952, the lines between East Germany and the western occupied zones could be easily crossed in most places. Accordingly, before 1961, most of that east-west flow took place between East and West Germany, with over 3.5 million East Germans emigrating to West Germany. On August 13, 1961, barbed-wire barrier that would become the Berlin Wall separating East and West Berlin was erected by East Germany. Two days later, police and army engineers began to construct a more permanent concrete wall.\n\nIn East Germany, the term Republikflucht (fugitives from the Republic) was used for anyone wishing to leave to non-socialist countries. A propaganda booklet published by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in 1955 for the use of party agitators outlined the seriousness of 'flight from the republic', stating \"leaving the GDR is an act of political and moral backwardness and depravity\", and \"workers throughout Germany will demand punishment for those who today leave the German Democratic Republic, the strong bastion of the fight for peace, to serve the deadly enemy of the German people, the imperialists and militarists\".\n\nFamous defectors include Joseph Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva, Mig-25 pilot Viktor Belenko, U.N. Undersecretary General Arkady Shevchenko, chess grand master Viktor Korchnoi, ballet stars Mikhail Baryshnikov, Natalia Makarova and Alexander Godunov. Famous East German defectors include author Wolfgang Leonhard, East German soldier Conrad Schumann who was photographed jumping the Berlin wall while under construction and a number of European football players, including Jörg Berger. While media sources often reported high level defections, non-prominent defections usually went unreported.\n\nPreviously, the Cuban government forbade its citizens from leaving or returning to Cuba without first obtaining permission from the government. In a translation by Human Rights Watch, under Cuba's criminal code, individuals who, \"without completing legal formalities, leave or take actions in preparation for leaving the national territory\" faced prison sentences of one to three years in prison. From 1985 to 1994 the number of illegal emigrants is estimated to 82,500, with an additional 7,500 up to the mid-2000. Even discussing illegal emigration carried a six-month prison sentence.\n\nHowever, Law-Decree 302, published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Cuba on October 16, 2012, went into effect on January 14, 2013. This immigration law eliminates the need for an exit permit but increases passport costs to 100 CUC, the equivalent of 5 months of average salary.\n\nIt is illegal for an Iranian woman to leave Iran alone without written permission from her husband or male relative if she is not married. Any woman of any nationality married to an Iranian man automatically becomes an Iranian citizen and is subject to these regulations. Betty Mahmoody, married to Iranian Sayyed Bozorg Mahmoody, was trapped in Iran after her husband had decided that they would stay there during a two-week vacation. She had to escape to Turkey aided by smugglers because she would not have legally been allowed to leave Iran without first obtaining a divorce from her husband, who would have gained full custody of their daughter, Mahtob Mahmoody.\n\nUntil 1974 individual freedom to emigrate from Portugal was subordinated to the aims and interests of the nation. The 1933 Constitution says that \"The state has the right and the obligation to coordinate and regulate the economic and social life of the Nation with the objective of populating the national territories, protecting emigrants, and disciplining emigration.\" The state tried to attain three key goals with this policy: meet labor needs, satisfy interests in Africa, and ensure benefits from emigrant remittances. At least 36 percent of Portuguese emigrants between 1950 and 1988 left the country illegally.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, the government of Burma has tightly restricted the number of Muslims allowed to travel to Mecca for the Haj pilgrimage. Muslims claimed they continue to have difficulties getting passports to travel abroad.\n\nIn Tunisia per 2001, authorities continued to deny passports to less prominent critics as well as to family members of political prisoners and expatriate activists.\n\nIf a person owes more than $2,500 in child support, he or she cannot get his or her US Passport renewed and therefore will not be able to leave the United States and could be deported back to the United States for not having a valid US passport.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have a travel ban for people who owe child support.\n\nPeople who owe child support are prevented from leaving the country.\n\nLebanon, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Nepal, Uzbekistan, Russia and Czech Republic may require special exit visas for foreign workers, departing workers, citizens, or visitors.\n\n\n\n"}

Weaver (born 1966) was the campaign manager for the 2016 campaign of US Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States. He formerly served as the campaign manager for Sanders' 2006 United States Senate election and as chief of staff in Sanders’ House and Senate offices. In August 2016, Weaver was named president of Our Revolution, a political organization created by Sanders, a position he held until June 2017. In May 2018, his book \"How Bernie Won: Inside the Revolution That's Taking Back Our Country\" was published.\n\nWeaver graduated from Missisquoi Valley Union High School in Franklin County, Vermont, in 1983. He attended Boston University as an undergraduate ROTC candidate. He was arrested there on April 24, 1986, for disorderly conduct, along with 10 other students; they became known as the \"BU Eleven.\" The group began building shanties on campus and tried to prevent university employees from tearing them down. During the incident several students, including Weaver, tried to prevent police from driving away. Some of the students were placed on probation and others suspended. Weaver received an honorable discharge from the Marines' Reserve Officers' Training Corps. Also in 1986, Weaver and three other students sued the university for the right to hang banners outside their dormitories. Yosef Abramowitz and two other students had displayed signs promoting divestment of the university with companies doing business with South Africa. When Abramowitz's sign was taken down, Weaver hung an American flag and two signs, one a Marine recruiting poster and the other reading \"In Solidarity With Yosef\". The university claimed it had a policy against dormitory banner displays, but the students argued it was selectively enforced, violating the right to free speech. The courts ruled in the students' favor, providing an immediate injunction against the students being forced to leave their dormitories, and also issuing a permanent injunction preventing the university from taking disciplinary action against the four for exercising their right of free speech.\n\nWeaver later graduated from the University of Vermont.\n\nWeaver's first role as a campaign staffer was in 1986 when he worked for Bernie Sanders's gubernatorial campaign as an Independent. Weaver served as a driver for Sanders.\n\nIn 1987, one year after his involvement with the Sanders gubernatorial campaign, Weaver launched a campaign of his own, running for St. Albans City Ward 4 alderman. He was 21 years old and known locally for his efforts to register new voters. In 1990, Weaver challenged incumbent St. Albans mayor Ron Firkey for his seat. Weaver ran as an Independent and lost with 40% of the vote. In conceding the race, he said, \"People haven't seen the last of Jeff Weaver.\"\n\nWeaver was a staffer for Sanders' successful 1990 congressional race. Following the race, he worked as a legislative assistant, eventually working his way up to chief of staff. Weaver later managed Sanders' successful 2006 Senate campaign and served as chief of staff.\n\nIn 2009, following his role as Sanders' Senate chief of staff, Weaver left the political scene to run a comics and gaming store, Victory Comics, in Falls Church, Virginia.\n\nIn May 2015, after a break from politics, Weaver was appointed campaign manager for Sanders' presidential campaign. \"The New York Times\" described Weaver as \"a long-trusted adviser to Mr. Sanders, who has developed a reputation inside and outside his campaign as a hard-charging operative often willing to go further than the candidate himself.\" In July 2016, after Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, Weaver promised \"to help organize voters\", but did not join her campaign staff.\n\nIn August 2016, Weaver was named the president of Our Revolution, a political organization created by Bernie Sanders. In response to his appointment, eight of Our Revolution's 13 staff members resigned. In late June 2017, he was succeeded by Nina Turner, former state senator of Ohio.\n\nIn May 2018, Weaver's book \"How Bernie Won: Inside the Revolution That's Taking Back Our Country--and Where We Go from Here\" was published. It is an account of the 2016 Sanders campaign and a wide-ranging assessment of its effects.\n\nDuring the promotional tour for the book, Weaver was interviewed on C-SPAN, Fox News<ref name=\"Fox News May 2018 article/interview video\"></ref> and \"The Young Turks\".\n"}

Over time, \"Mule Day\" evolved from a single day event into a multi-day festival, attracting thousands of attendees, lasting almost a week. According to its official website, the heavy involvement of Maury County in the mule industry caused the event to grow for a time into \"one of the largest livestock markets in the world.\"\n\nIn 1933, Thomas Marion Brown had the idea for a Mule Day Parade and Celebration as a way to bring in money to the community. He approached W.D. Hastings of the \"Daily Herald\" and J.J. Johnson to bring this event to life. They went to the Chamber of Commerce and in 1934 the First Mule Day Parade was a reality.

{"id": "431228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=431228", "title": "Naadam", "text": "Naadam\n\nNaadam (, classical Mongolian: \"Naɣadum\", , \"literally \"games\"\") is a traditional festival in Mongolia. The festival is also locally termed \"eriin gurvan naadam\" () \"the three games of men\". The games are Mongolian wrestling, horse racing, and archery, and are held throughout the country during midsummer. Women have started participating in the archery and girls in the horse-racing games, but not in Mongolian wrestling.\n\nIn 2010, Naadam was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO.\n\nNaadam is the most widely watched festival among Mongols, and is believed to have existed for centuries in one fashion or another. It has its origin in the activities, such as military parades and sporting competitions such as archery, horse riding and wrestling, that followed the celebration of various occasions, including weddings or spiritual gatherings. It later served as a way to train soldiers for battle, and was also connected to Mongols' nomadic lifestyle. Mongolians practice their unwritten holiday rules that include a long song to start the holiday, then a \"Biyelgee\" dance. Traditional cuisine, or \"Khuushuur\", is served around the Sports Stadium along with a special drink made of horse milk (\"airag\"). The three games of wrestling, horse racing, and archery are recorded in the 13th-century book \"The Secret History of the Mongols\". During the Qing dynasty's rule, Naadam became a festival officially held by sums. Now it formally commemorates the 1921 Revolution, when Mongolia declared independence from China. Naadam also celebrates the achievements of the new state. It was celebrated as a Buddhist/shaman holiday until secularization in the 1930s under the Communist influence of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe biggest festival (National Naadam) is held in the Mongolian capital, Ulaanbaatar, during the National Holiday from July 11 to 13, in the National Sports Stadium. It begins with an elaborate introduction ceremony featuring dancers, athletes, horse riders, and musicians. After the ceremony, the competitions begin. The competitions are mainly horseback riding. Naadam is also celebrated in different regions of Mongolia and Inner Mongolia in July and August. In the Tuva Republic, Naadam is on 15 August.\n\nThe three sports are called \"Danshig\" games. They became the great celebration of the new nation, where the nobility got together to dedicate to the Jabzundamba Khutugtu, the new head of state.\n\nGenghis Khan's nine horse tails, representing the nine tribes of the Mongols, are still ceremonially transported from Sukhbaatar Square to the Stadium to open the Naadam festivities. At the opening and closing ceremonies, there are impressive parades of mounted cavalry, athletes and monks.\n\nAnother popular Naadam activity is the playing of games using \"shagai,\" sheep anklebones that serve as game pieces and tokens of both divination and friendship. In the larger Naadam festivals, tournaments may take place in a separate venue.\n\nA total of 512 or 1024 wrestlers meet in a single-elimination tournament that lasts nine or ten rounds. Mongolian traditional wrestling is an untimed competition in which wrestlers lose if they touch the ground with any part of their body other than their feet or hands. When picking pairs, the wrestler with the greatest fame has the privilege to choose his opponent. Wrestlers wear two-piece costumes consisting of a tight shoulder vest (\"zodog\") and shorts (\"shuudag\"). Only men are allowed to participate.\n\nEach wrestler has an \"encourager\" called a \"zasuul\". The zasuul sings a song of praise for the winning wrestler after rounds 3, 5, and 7. Winners of the 7th or 8th stage (depending on whether the competition features 512 or 1024 wrestlers) earn the title of \"zaan\", \"elephant\". The winner of the 9th or 10th stage is called \"arslan\", \"lion\". In the final competition, all the \"zasuuls\" drop in the wake of each wrestler as they take steps toward each other. Two-time arslans are called the titans / giants, or \"avraga\".\n\nUnlike Western horse racing, which consists of short sprints generally not much longer than 2 km, Mongolian horse racing as featured in Naadam is a cross-country event, with races 15–30 km long. The length of each race is determined by age class. For example, two-year-old horses race for ten miles and seven-year-olds for seventeen miles. Up to 1000 horses from any part of Mongolia can be chosen to participate. Race horses are fed a special diet.\n\nChildren from 5 to 13 are chosen as jockeys and train in the months preceding the races. While jockeys are an important component, the main purpose of the races is to test the skill of the horses.\n\nBefore the races begin, the audience sings traditional songs and the jockeys sing a song called \"Gingo\". Prizes are awarded to horses and jockeys. The top five horses in each class earn the title of \"airgiyn tav\" and the top three are given gold, silver, and bronze medals. The winning jockey is praised with the title of \"tumny ekh\" or leader of ten thousand. The horse that finishes last in the Daaga race (two-year-old horses race) is called \"bayan khodood\" (meaning \"full stomach\"). A song is sung to the Bayan khodood wishing him luck to be next year's winner. More about horse riding in Mongolia\nIn this competition both men and women may participate. It is played by teams of ten. Each archer is given four arrows; the team must hit 33 \"\"surs\".\" Men shoot their arrows from 75 meters away while women shoot theirs from 65 meters away. Traditionally the archers wear their national clothing (\"Deel\") during the competition. All the archers wear leather bracers up to the elbow on their outstretched arm, so that the \"deel’s\" cuff does not interfere with shooting.\nMongolian archery is unique for having dozens of \"surs\" as targets. Each \"sur\" is a small woven or wooden cylinder. They are placed on top of each other forming a wall three-high, which is approximately 8 inches high by 5 feet wide. Knocking a \"sur\" out of the wall with an arrow counts as a hit, though knocking a \"sur\" out of the centre will bring a competitor more points. When the archer hits the target, the judge says \"uuhai\" which means \"hooray\". After each hit, an official repairs the damaged wall and makes it ready for the next attempt. The winners of the contest are granted the titles of \"national marksman\" and \"national markswoman\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1820062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1820062", "title": "Operation Focus", "text": "Operation Focus\n\nOperation Focus (, \"Mivtza Moked\") was the opening airstrike by Israel at the start of the Six-Day War in 1967. It is sometimes referred to as \"Sinai Air Strike\". At 07:45 on June 5, 1967, the Israeli Air Force (IAF) under Maj. Gen. Mordechai Hod launched a massive airstrike that destroyed the majority of the Egyptian Air Force on the ground. By noon, the Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian Air Forces, with about 450 aircraft, were destroyed. It was also very successful in disabling 18 airfields in Egypt, hindering Egyptian Air Force operations for the duration of the war, and remains one of the most successful air attack campaigns in military history.\n\nIn three main waves of aerial attacks, and several smaller waves in the days following the operation, a total of 452 aircraft were destroyed, most of them on the ground. That left the IAF in almost complete control of the skies, and it was able to assist the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) ground units effectively.\n\nThe operational success was achieved by concentrating on the initial destruction of the runways with a new kind of weapon, a rocket assisted anti-runway warhead. The prototype French/Israeli anti-runway weapon program uses rocket braking over the target to point the warhead directly toward the runway being attacked; at a set altitude, a second accelerator rocket ignites and drives the warhead through the pavement of the runway before it detonates. The explosion creates a small crater over a large new sinkhole, meaning the damaged runway section must be completely removed before the sinkhole can be repaired rather than a normal bomb crater which is simply filled in and patched. Once the runways were disabled, entire air bases' complements of aircraft were effectively grounded and fell victim to subsequent attack waves, resulting in near-total Israeli air supremacy.\n\nOperation Moked was launched at 7:45 am Israeli time (8:45 Egyptian time). Nearly all of Israel's 196 combat aircraft (mostly French/Dassault Aviation) were committed to the airstrike, with only twelve being held back to patrol Israeli airspace.\n\nEgyptian defensive infrastructure was extremely poor, and no airfields were yet equipped with hardened aircraft shelters capable of protecting Egypt's warplanes in the event of an attack. The Israeli warplanes headed out over the Mediterranean before turning toward Egypt. Meanwhile, the Egyptians hindered their own defense by effectively shutting down their entire air defense system: they were worried that rebel Egyptian forces would shoot down the plane carrying Field Marshal Amer and Lt-Gen. Sidqi Mahmoud, who were en route from al Maza to Bir Tamada in the Sinai to meet the commanders of the troops stationed there. In this event it did not make a great deal of difference as the Israeli pilots came in below Egyptian radar cover and well below the lowest point at which Egypt's SA-2 surface-to-air missile batteries could bring down an aircraft.\n\nThe first Israeli wave attacked 11 bases, catching much of the Egyptian Air Force on the ground and destroying them before they got airborne. The Israeli jets then returned to Israel, were \"quick-turned\" (refueled and re-armed) in 7 minutes 30 seconds, and left in a second wave that attacked 14 Egyptian bases and returned with only minor losses. They \"quick-turned\" again and departed in a third wave.\n\nThe opening stages of Operation Moked were a complete success: Egypt's air force of nearly 500 combat aircraft was destroyed in the space of three hours, with only minor losses to the Israeli Air Force. When Syria, Jordan, and Iraq attacked Israeli targets in retaliation for the airstrike on Egypt, their attacks were mainly directed at civilian targets and were largely ineffectual. In response many of the IAF planes headed for a third strike on Egypt were diverted en route to Syrian and Jordanian targets, and other IAF aircraft were sent against Arab ground forces in support of Israeli ground forces. By the end of the first day of the Six-day War, Israel had complete air superiority over Egypt, the Golan Heights, the West Bank, and the entire Sinai desert.\n\nOn the second day of the war (June 6) the IAF was used against Egyptian, Jordanian, Syrian, and Iraqi ground forces.\n\nOn the third day (June 7) the IAF destroyed hundreds of Egyptian vehicles trying to flee across the Sinai in convoys and trapped thousands more in narrow Sinai passes. By the end of the third day Jordan's air force of 34 combat aircraft had essentially ceased to exist and the Jordanian military was no longer in the fight.\n\nBy the sixth and final day (June 10) Syria had lost approximately 100 combat aircraft and the fighting was over.\n\nDuring the Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force, with 196 combat aircraft at its disposal had prevailed over a coalition with approximately 600 combat aircraft. The IAF destroyed 452 enemy aircraft, including 79 in air combat, while losing 46 of its own. 24 Israeli pilots and hundreds of Arab pilots were killed.\n\n\n\n\nThe effectiveness of the operation showed how vulnerable fixed air base installations were to aerial attacks at the time. This caused many nations air forces to develop improved defensive measures against it, such as constructing hardened aircraft shelters to protect aircraft on the ground and establishing highway strips as alternative air bases.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "367461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=367461", "title": "Pholcidae", "text": "Pholcidae\n\nPholcidae, commonly known as cellar spiders, are a spider family in the suborder Araneomorphae. The family contains about 1500 species divided into about 80 genera.\n\nSome species, especially \"Pholcus phalangioides\", are commonly called daddy long-legs spider, granddaddy long-legs spider, carpenter spider, daddy long-legger, vibrating spider or skull spider.\n\nConfusion often arises because the name \"daddy long-legs\" is also applied to two other, distantly related groups of arthropods: harvestmen (which are arachnids but not spiders) and crane flies (which are insects).\n\nPholcids are thin and fragile arachnids. The body (resembling the shape of a peanut) being approximately 2–10 mm (0.08-0.39 inches) in length with legs which may be up to 50 mm (1.97 inches) long. \"Pholcus\" and \"Smeringopus\" have cylindrical abdomens and eyes arranged in two lateral groups of three and two smaller median contiguous eyes. Arrangements of eight and six eyes both occur in this family. \"Spermophora\" has a small globose abdomen and its eyes are arranged in two groups of three without median eyes. Pholcids are gray to brown, sometimes clear, with banding or chevron markings.\n\nPholcids are found in every continent in the world except Antarctica. Pholcids hang inverted in their messy and irregular-shaped webs. These webs are constructed in dark and damp recesses such as caves, under rocks and loose bark, abandoned mammal burrows. In areas of human habitation pholcids construct webs in undisturbed areas in buildings such as attics and cellars (hence the common name \"cellar spider\").\n\nThe web of pholcids has no adhesive properties and instead relies on its irregular structure to trap prey. When pholcid spiders detect prey within their webs the spiders quickly envelop prey before inflicting a fatal bite. The prey may be eaten immediately or stored for later. When finished they will clean the web by unhooking the prey and letting it drop from the web.\n\nSome species of Pholcidae exhibit a threat response when disturbed by a touch to the web or entangled large prey. The arachnid responds by vibrating rapidly in a gyrating motion in its web. While they are not the only species of spider to exhibit this behaviour, this behaviour has led to these spiders sometimes being called \"vibrating spiders\". There are several proposed reasons for this threat response. The movement may make it difficult for a predator to locate the spider or may be a signal to an assumed rival to leave. Vibrating may also increase the chances of capturing insects that have just brushed their web and are still hovering nearby. If the spider continues to be harassed it will retreat into a corner or drop from its web and escape.\n\nCertain species of these spiders invade webs of other spiders to eat the host, the eggs, or the prey. In some cases the spider vibrates the web of other spiders, mimicking the struggle of trapped prey to lure the host closer. Pholcids are natural predators of the \"Tegenaria\" species and are known to attack and eat redback spiders, huntsman spiders and house spiders. Pholcids may be beneficial to humans living in regions with dense hobo spider populations as predation on \"Tegenaria\" may keep populations in check.\n\n\"Pholcus phalangioides\" often uses an alternating tetrapod gait (first right leg, then second left leg, then third right leg, etc.), which is commonly found in many spider species. However, frequent variations from this pattern have been documented during observations of the spiders’ movements.\n\n, the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera:\nThere is a legend that daddy long-legs spiders have the most potent venom of any spider, but that their fangs are either too small or too weak to puncture human skin; the same legend is also repeated of the harvestman and crane fly, also known as \"daddy long-legs\" in some regions. Indeed, pholcid spiders do have a short fang structure (called uncate due to its \"hooked\" shape). Brown recluse spiders also have uncate fang structure, but are able to deliver medically significant bites.\n\nPossible explanations include: pholcid venom is not toxic to humans; pholcid uncate are smaller than those of brown recluse; or there is a musculature difference between the two arachnids, with recluses, being hunting spiders, possessing stronger muscles for fang penetration. According to Rick Vetter of the University of California at Riverside, the daddy long-legs spider has never harmed a human and there is no evidence that they are dangerous to humans.\n\nThe legend may result from the fact that the daddy long-legs spider preys upon deadly venomous spiders, such as the redback, a member of the black widow genus \"Latrodectus\". To the extent that such entomological information was known to the general public, it was perhaps thought that if the daddy long-legs spider could kill a spider capable of delivering fatal bites to humans, then it must be more venomous, and the uncate fangs were regarded as prohibiting it from killing people. In reality, it is able to cast lengths of silk onto its prey, incapacitating them from a safe distance.\n\nDuring 2004, the Discovery Channel television show \"MythBusters\" tested the daddy long-legs venom myth in episode 13 - \"Buried in concrete\". Hosts Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage first established that the spider's venom was not as toxic as other venoms, after being told about an experiment whereby mice were injected with venom from both a daddy long-legs and a black widow, with the black widow venom producing a much stronger reaction.\n\nAfter measuring the spider's fangs at approximately 0.25 mm, Adam Savage inserted his hand into a container with several daddy-long-legs, and reported that he felt a bite which produced a mild, short-lived burning sensation. The bite did in fact penetrate his skin, but did not cause any notable harm. Additionally, recent research has shown that pholcid venom is relatively weak in its effects on insects.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

{"id": "69361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69361", "title": "Religious festival", "text": "Religious festival\n\nA religious festival is a time of special importance marked by adherents to that religion. Religious festivals are commonly celebrated on recurring cycles in a calendar year or lunar calendar. Hundreds of very different religious festivals are held around the world each year and a religious festival is about celebrating something that is special to that religion.\n\nFestivals \"(feriae)\" were an important part of Roman religious life during both the Republican and Imperial eras, and were one of the primary features of the Roman calendar. \"Feriae\" (\"holidays\" in the sense of \"holy days\") were either public \"(publicae)\" or private \"(privatae)\". State holidays were celebrated by the Roman people and received public funding. \"Feriae privatae\" were holidays celebrated in honor of private individuals or by families.\n\nThe 1st-century BC scholar Varro defined \"feriae\" as \"days instituted for the sake of the gods.\" A deity's festival often marked the anniversary (\"dies natalis,\" \"birthday\") of the founding of the deity's temple, or a rededication after a major renovation. Public business was suspended for the performance of religious rites on the \"feriae\". Cicero says that people who were free should not engage in lawsuits and quarrels, and slaves should get a break from their labors. On calendars of the Republic and early Empire, the religious status of days were marked by letters such as \"F\" (for \"fastus\", when it was religiously permissible to conduct legal business), \"C\" (for \"comitialis)\", a day on which the Roman people could hold assemblies), and \"N\" (for \"nefastus\", when political activities and the administration of justice were prohibited). By the late 2nd century AD, extant calendars no longer show these letters, probably as a result of calendar reforms undertaken by Marcus Aurelius that recognized the changed religious environment of the empire.\nOn surviving Roman calendars, festivals that appear in large capital letters (such as the Lupercalia and Parilia) are thought to have been the most ancient holidays, becoming part of the calendar before 509 BC. Some of the oldest festivals are not named for deities. During the Imperial period, several traditional festivals localized at Rome became less important, and the birthdays and anniversaries of the emperor and his family gained prominence as Roman holidays. Games \"(ludi)\", such as the Ludi Apollinares, were often dedicated to particular deities, but were not technically \"feriae\", although they might be holidays in the modern sense of days off work \"(dies festi)\". After the mid-1st century AD, there were more frequent spectacles and games \"(circenses)\" held in the venue called a \"circus\", in honor of various deities or for imperial anniversaries \"(dies Augusti)\". A religious festival held on a single day, such as the Floralia, might be expanded with games over multiple days \"(Ludi Florae)\"; the festival of Flora is seen as a precursor of May Day festivities.\n\nA major source for Roman holidays is Ovid's \"Fasti\", a poem that describes and provides origins for festivals from January to June at the time of Augustus. Because it ends with June, less is known about Roman festivals in the second half of the year, with the exception of the Saturnalia, a religious festival in honor of Saturn on December 17 that expanded with celebrations through December 23. Probably the best-known Roman festival, some of its customs, such as gift-giving and the prevalence of candles, are thought to have influenced popular celebrations of Christmas.\n\nJapanese festivals and Barua festivals often involve Buddhist culture, as do pagoda festivals held as fairs held at Buddhist temples in countries such as Thailand. Features of Buddhist Tibetan festivals may include the traditional cham dance, which is also a feature of some Buddhist festivals in India and Bhutan. Many festivals of Nepal are religious festivals involving Buddhism.\n\nThe central festival of Christianity is Easter, on which Christians celebrate their belief that Jesus Christ rose from the dead on the third day after his crucifixion. Even for Easter, however, there is no agreement among the various Christian traditions regarding the date or manner of the observance, less for Christmas, Pentecost, or various other holidays. Both Protestants and Catholics observe certain festivals commemorating events in the life of Christ. Of these, the two most important are Christmas, which commemorates the Birth of Jesus, and Easter, which marks his resurrection.\n\n'Utsava' is the Sanskrit word for Hindu festivals, meaning 'to cause to grow 'upward'. Hindus observe sacred occasions by festive observances. All festivals in Hinduism are predominantly religious in character and significance. Many festivals are seasonal. Some celebrate harvest and the birth of gods or heroes. Some are dedicated to important events in Hindu mythology. Many are dedicated to Shiva and Parvati, Vishnu and Lakshmi and Brahma and Saraswati. A festival may be observed with acts of worship, offerings to deities, fasting, feasting, vigil, rituals, fairs, charity, celebrations, Puja, Homa, aarti etc. They celebrate individual and community life of Hindus without distinction of caste, gender or class. In the Hindu calendar dates are usually prescribed according to the lunar calendar. In vedic timekeeping, a tithi is a lunar day. Among major festivals are Diwali, Gudi Padwa, Pongal, Holi, Ganesh Chaturthi, Raksha Bhandan, Krishna Janmashtami, Dasara or Dussehra, which may refer to the ten days of Sharada Navratri or the tenth day, Vijayadashami. Others include Onam, Shivaratri, Ugadi, Rathayatra of Lord Jaganatha at Puri in Ilam, Nepal and many other places in Nepal and many other countries\n\nAmong major Islamic religious festivals are Eid ul-Adha, Eid ul-Fitr, Ramadan and Urs.\n\nImportant festivals include Paryushan, Mahavir Jayanti and Diwali.\n\nA Jewish holiday (\"Yom Tov\" or \"chag\" in Hebrew) is a day that is holy to the Jewish people according to Judaism and is usually derived from the Hebrew Bible, specifically the Torah, and in some cases established by the rabbis in later eras. There are a number of festival days, fast days (\"ta'anit\") and days of remembrance.\n\nThe birthday of Guru Ravidass on \"Magh Purnima\" (February 7–12) is celebrated as \"Guru Ravidass Jayanti\" every year.\n\nMajor Sikh festivals include Guru Nanak Jayanti, Guru Gobind Jayanti, Maghi, Poonai, Sangrand, and Vaisakhi.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24370232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24370232", "title": "Renault Formula One crash controversy", "text": "Renault Formula One crash controversy\n\nThe Renault Formula One crash controversy, dubbed Crashgate by some in the media, is a sporting scandal perpetrated by the Renault F1 team who ordered Nelson Piquet Jr. to crash deliberately during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, to gain a sporting advantage for his Renault teammate Fernando Alonso.\n\nOn 28 September 2008, on the 14th lap of the Singapore race, the Renault R28 driven by Piquet crashed into the circuit wall at turn 17, necessitating a safety car deployment. The other Renault driver, Fernando Alonso, had previously made an early pitstop, and was promoted to the race lead as other cars pitted under safety car conditions. Alonso subsequently won the race after starting 15th on the grid. Piquet described his crash at the time as a simple mistake.\n\nAfter being dropped by the Renault team following the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Piquet alleged that he had been asked by the team to deliberately crash to improve the race situation for Alonso, sparking an investigation of Renault F1 for race fixing by Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the Formula One governing body. After an investigation, Renault F1 were charged with conspiracy on 4 September, and were to answer the charge on 21 September 2009.\n\nOn 16 September Renault stated that they would not contest the charges, and announced that the team's managing director, Flavio Briatore, and its executive director of engineering, Pat Symonds, had left the team.\n\nOn 21 September it was announced that the Renault F1 team had been handed a disqualification from Formula One, which was suspended for two years pending any further comparable rule infringements. Briatore was suspended from all Formula One events and FIA-sanctioned events indefinitely, whilst Symonds received a five-year ban. Their bans were subsequently overturned by a French court, although they both agreed not to work in Formula One or FIA-sanctioned events for a specified time as part of a later settlement reached with the governing body.\n\nThe Renault F1 Formula One team came into existence with the car manufacturer Renault's re-entrance into Formula One in 2000, by purchasing the Benetton Formula One team. Italian businessman Flavio Briatore had been managing director of Benetton until 1997, when he was replaced by Prodrive boss David Richards. After managing Renault's motorsport sister company Mecachrome, he returned to the main team following the Renault takeover, again as managing director. In addition to his Formula One sporting interests, as of August 2007, Briatore was Chairman and part owner of the English football club Queens Park Rangers F.C. (QPR), which he purchased jointly with Formula One president Bernie Ecclestone, being joined later by funds from Indian industrialist Lakshmi Mittal.\n\nSpanish racing driver Fernando Alonso had been involved in Formula One since 2001, and drove for the team from 2002 to 2006. After becoming World Champion in 2005 and 2006 and a one-year stint with McLaren, he returned to the team in 2008. English engineer Pat Symonds had risen to his position as Executive Director of Engineering with Renault F1 having worked for the Benetton team, and having entered Formula One with Benetton's predecessor Toleman Motosport in the early 1980s. Brazilian racing car driver Nelson Piquet Jr. – son of the Formula One triple-world champion Nelson Piquet – joined the Renault F1 team as the second car driver alongside Alonso for the 2008 season, having been their reserve and test driver during 2007. Since October 2006, Piquet Jr. was also personally contracted to Flavio Briatore's management company FFBB. Before the Singapore incident, Renault F1 had not won a race for almost two years (the last Grand Prix won was on 8 October 2006, the Japanese Grand Prix), and were said to be close to quitting the sport.\n\nThe 2008 Singapore Grand Prix was the fifteenth race of the 2008 Formula One season, and took place on 28 September 2008. The race was Formula One's first night race. On the race weekend, despite Alonso being close to the top in practice, Renault had a poor qualifying session and started well down the grid, with Fernando Alonso starting in fifteenth place, and Nelson Piquet Jr. alongside him in 16th. Alonso was eliminated during qualifying because of mechanical failure.\n\nAfter the race started, Alonso was the first driver to make a routine pit stop for fuel and tyres on lap 12, rejoining the race at the back of the field. He had put in a light fuel load at the start of the race in an attempt to pass the cars in front of him; most drivers that qualify in low positions tend to do the opposite and go for heavier fuel loads to make one less pit stop (approximately 30 seconds each in terms of time loss) than the leaders, as they do not want to waste a light car and an extra pit stop for a faster car that is stuck behind slower vehicles. Three laps later, Nelson Piquet Jr. hit the circuit wall at turn seventeen, one of the turns on the circuit which did not have a crane nearby, necessitating the deployment of the safety car.\nSafety car regulations in 2008 meant that the pit lane was closed until all cars had been bunched up behind the safety car. Hence the advantage of the lead cars would be eliminated before they were able to pit and after they did pit, they would re-enter the race at the back of the field. Alonso, having pitted just before the safety car was introduced, therefore gained a significant advantage. (Under previous regulations, the pit lane remained open during safety car incidents and the lead cars could quickly pit before their lead was eliminated and re-enter the race with less loss of track position.) In order to avoid running out of fuel, some drivers did need to pit while the pit lane was closed and they were penalised for the infraction.\n\nMost of the leading cars ended up behind Alonso and also behind some slower drivers who proved difficult to pass on the narrow circuit; those ahead of Alonso were lighter on fuel and whilst they were able to pull away, they still needed to make a pit stop. After gaining the lead in the final third of the race, Alonso went on to win the race.\n\nNo action was initially taken over the crash. Piquet Jr. initially characterised the crash as a simple mistake. In the post-race press release from Renault F1, the team described Alonso's performance as a \"brilliant tactical drive\", while both Briatore and Symonds attributed the safety car use as a case of good luck. Following the race, freelance Formula One journalist Joe Saward, writing on grandprix.com, stated that \"some cynics\" were questioning the incident, but dismissed it with the opinion that \"one likes to believe that no team would ever be so desperate as to have a driver throw his car at a wall\". According to the Brazilian television station Rede Globo, Brazilian driver Felipe Massa, who finished the Singapore race in 13th having been leading at the time of Piquet Jr.'s crash, and eventually lost the 2008 World Championship to Lewis Hamilton by one point, did question Briatore about the crash at the time, although FIA president Max Mosley stated the sport could take no action based on \"speculation\".\n\nFernando Alonso ended the 2008 season fifth in the Drivers Championship with 61 points, while Nelson Piquet Jr. finished in twelfth place, with 19 points. Their collective total earned Renault F1 fourth place in the Constructors Championship. Despite rumours that he was set to leave the team, Renault re-signed Piquet Jr. on a one-year contract for the 2009 season, once again alongside Alonso. By the tenth race of the 2009 season, Piquet Jr. had failed to score any points whereas Alonso had managed 13 for the team. On 3 August 2009, Piquet confirmed that he had been dropped by Renault. The departure was acrimonious, with Piquet Jr. criticising his former Renault F1 team and Briatore.\n\nOn 30 August 2009, reports by the Brazilian television station Rede Globo stated that Nelson Piquet Jr. was ordered to crash during the Singapore race. Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), immediately announced it was investigating \"alleged incidents at a previous F1 event\". It was widely reported that the race in question was the Singapore 2008 race.\n\nOn 4 September, following the investigation by the FIA, Renault F1 were formally accused of interfering with the outcome of the 2008 Singapore race and conspiring with Piquet Jr. In a statement, the FIA stated that the charges against Renault F1 included \"a breach of Article 151c of the International Sporting Code, that the team conspired with its driver, Nelson Piquet Jr, to cause a deliberate crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix with the aim of causing the deployment of the safety car to the advantage of its other driver, Fernando Alonso.\" The team was called to a meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 21 September, days before the 2009 running of the Singapore Grand Prix. After being charged, the Renault F1 team stated that they would be making no comments until the hearing.\n\nOn 10 September, Piquet Jr. made the second of two statements to the FIA. On the same day, a transcript of Piquet Jr's first statement to the FIA made at their Headquarters in Paris on 30 July was published by F1SA.com (the F1 Supporters Association). In response to questions over its authenticity, the FIA president Max Mosley stated \"I haven't seen anything which I believe to be a forgery.\" In the transcript, Piquet Jr. states that he was asked by Briatore and Symonds to crash his car at a specific corner. Alonso denied knowing of any plan to ask Piquet to crash, stating \"I cannot imagine these things, these situations. It's something that never entered my mind.\" Nelson Piquet Jr. questioned whether Alonso knew that a crash was planned, citing that in his place, he would have questioned Renault's \"senseless\" Alonso race strategy of starting with a low fuel load and making an early pit stop on the twelfth lap. During the course of the investigation and before the WMSC hearing, Alonso was absolved of any blame by the FIA. On 11 September, Max Mosley, the FIA president confirmed Piquet Jr. would face no action after making his two statements, even if the case was found in favour of Renault.\n\nOn 11 September, the day after Piquet Jr.'s statement to the FIA was leaked, Renault F1 stated that it intended to take legal action against Nelson Piquet Jr and his father in both French and British courts, stating that \"...today the ING Renault F1 Team and its managing director Flavio Briatore personally wish to state they have commenced criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet Jr and Nelson Piquet Sr in France concerning the making of false allegations and a related attempt to blackmail the team into allowing Mr Piquet Jr to drive for the remainder of the 2009 season\". In response to the legal action, Piquet Jr. stated \"Because I am telling the truth I have nothing to fear, whether from the Renault team or Mr Briatore – and while I am well aware of the power and influence of those being investigated, and the vast resources at their disposal, I will not be bullied again into making a decision I regret\".\n\nOn 14 September 2009, Pat Symonds was also reported to have been offered immunity from action if he provided the FIA with details of the alleged conspiracy. Symonds was reported to have told FIA investigators that the initial idea of a crash had come from Piquet Jr.\n\nOn 15 September, \"The Times\" newspaper published extracts of Renault F1 radio conversations transmitted before and after the Singapore race between Renault F1 personnel including Piquet Jr., Alonso, Symonds and Briatore.\n\nOn 16 September the Renault F1 team announced it would not be contesting the charges at the meeting of the FIA World Motor Sport Council in Paris on 21 September, and stated that both Briatore and Symonds had left the team.\n\nThe FIA confirmed that 21 September meeting would still go ahead following the departure of Briatore and Symonds, with sanctions against Renault F1 still possible. The day after the Renault announcement, Renault confirmed Briatore had resigned from the team, while Briatore himself stated of his departure that \"I was just trying to save the team\", \"It's my duty. That's the reason I've finished.\"\n\nThe extraordinary meeting of the World Motorsports Council took place on 21 September 2009 in Paris. After a ninety-minute hearing, the council imposed a disqualification on Renault, suspended for two years. This meant that if a similar incident occurred before 2011, Renault would be banned from Formula One. Briatore was banned indefinitely from any FIA-sanctioned event, while Symonds received a five-year ban. Furthermore, Briatore was indefinitely banned from managing drivers when the FIA stated that superlicences would not be issued or renewed to any driver associated with him in the future. Alonso was cleared of wrongdoing; the FIA found no evidence that he or his mechanics knew anything about the scheme.\n\nThe council came down hard on Briatore because he denied his involvement despite overwhelming evidence. Symonds, in contrast, had confessed, expressing his \"eternal regret and shame\" for his role in the scheme. In announcing the sanctions, the council stated that Renault's actions were serious enough to merit being thrown out of Formula One altogether. However, it opted to impose a suspended sentence because Renault took swift action in forcing Briatore and Symonds to resign. \"The Daily Mirror\" described the \"de facto\" lifetime ban on Briatore as the harshest sanction ever imposed on an individual in the history of motorsport.\n\nA major contribution to the punishment of Briatore and Symonds was the testimony of the unnamed \"Witness X\", a Renault employee who was also present at the pre-race meeting but rejected the idea. The Daily Mail has reported that Witness X was Alan Permane, the team's chief race engineer.\n\nAfter Renault F1 were formally charged, the alleged offence was thought to be unprecedented within Formula One. The scandal followed two recent Formula One cheating scandals: a case of industrial espionage between teams (including Renault F1); and an instance of the 2008 World Champion Lewis Hamilton being found to have lied to race stewards in March 2009.\n\nThe scandal interrupted the team's parent company Renault S.A.'s launch of four electric vehicles at the Frankfurt Motor Show after journalists questioned Renault chief executive Carlos Ghosn over the affair, who directed all inquiries to Bernard Rey, chairman of Renault F1. On 17 September, Patrick Pelata, Renault S.A.'s chief operating officer, first representative from Renault to officially comment on the Singapore crash affair, stated that \"The [Renault F1] team believes that a mistake has been made, and punishment must follow. Flavio Briatore considered himself to be morally responsible and resigned\" and that the team would defer making a decision on the future options for the team. Pelata added that he did not wish the actions of Briatore and Symonds to \"reflect upon the whole company and the entire Formula 1 team\". In addition, Ghosn also called for calm and for Renault to \"not react in the heat of the moment\" while the Renault F1 team collaborated with the authorities, adding that \"I am confident when the facts are established, we can take a very clear decision\".\n\nFormer Jordan Grand Prix F1 team principal Eddie Jordan believed that the departure of Briatore and Symonds from Renault on 16 September was an effective admission of guilt. Former three-time Formula One World Champion and former team owner Sir Jackie Stewart said of the Singapore scandal that \"There is something fundamentally rotten and wrong at the heart of Formula One. Never in my experience has Formula One been in such a mood of self-destruction. Millions of fans are amazed, if not disgusted, at a sport which now goes from crisis to crisis with everyone blaming everyone else.\" Former three-time Formula One World Champion and former Jaguar Racing team manager Niki Lauda, while comparing the Singapore incident to the 2007 espionage scandal, declared that \"This [the Singapore crash incident], though, is new. The biggest damage ever. Now the FIA must punish Renault heavily to restore credibility in the sport.\" Former 1996 F1 World Champion Damon Hill described the Singapore crash as \"not a very good episode\" for the sport and said of the future of F1 that \"I'm concerned the sport is going to suffer as a genuine challenge, which is what I always felt it should be and would like it to be, of skill and competitiveness\". Former racing driver Eddie Irvine, who retired from Formula One at the end of 2002, believed that the response to the Singapore incident had been an overreaction, stating that \"This [Singapore incident] is probably slightly on the wrong side of the cheating thing but in days past every team have done whatever they could to win – cheat, bend the rules, break the rules, sabotage opponents\", \"[t]his is just the FIA going on a crusade\". He also speculated that the FIA would be lenient on Renault F1 and not expel them, due to the sport's current \"shaky\" condition after recent team departures.\n\nChief Sportswriter Simon Barnes of British newspaper \"The Times\" sparked debate over the incident when he labelled it \"the worst single piece of cheating in the history of sport\" primarily because of its \"potentially lethal consequences\" to Piquet, the other drivers, marshals and spectators. Supporting Barnes, \"The Times\"' motor racing correspondent Edward Gorman cited the alleged top level pre-conceived elements of conspiracy that sought to sacrifice one team member to benefit another to put the incident on a par with controversies such as Ben Johnson, horse doping and illegal keels used in the America's Cup. Gorman then postulated that this incident was worse than those because Briatore and Symonds set in motion \"an event of violent destruction, the consequences of which they could neither predict nor control.\" Matthew Syed countered that while the incident was premeditated, \"unspeakably unethical\" and dangerous, it was not nearly as reckless as the East German athletics doping scandal and other instances of long-term doping. Syed also argued that the Renault team would not have been expecting injuries to result from the crash, in contrast to incidents such as the assault on ice skater Nancy Kerrigan.\n\nResponding to Flavio Briatore's resignation from Renault F1, Formula One Management's Bernie Ecclestone stated that \"It is a pity that Flavio has ended his Formula One career in this way\", \"You can't defend him at all. What he did was completely unnecessary. It's a pity that it's happened\", although Ecclestone denied that the scandal would 'finish' the sport, citing the sport's recovery from the death of Ayrton Senna and the retirement of seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher.\n\nIn response to the scandal, Renault's main sponsors ING and Mutua Madrileña ended their sponsorship agreements with Renault early, within a week after the FIA's decision and right before the next race, the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix, with the team removing their logos from the cars before the event.\n\nMajor sponsor Mutua Madrileña withdrew its sponsorship of the Renault F1 team first, just before the 2009 Singapore Grand Prix weekend, believing that the situation \"could affect the image, reputation and good name of the team's sponsors.\" Mutua Madrileña did not withdraw sponsorship of Renault driver Fernando Alonso, as he was not implicated in the scandal. This was followed hours later by the withdrawal of title sponsor ING Group with immediate effect, who had been previously due to end their sponsorship of the team at the end of 2009.\n\nOn 19 October 2009, Flavio Briatore announced his intentions to sue the FIA for his lifetime ban, claiming that \"the FIA [had] been used as a tool of vengeance on behalf of one man\" and that there were several miscarriages of justice, including a delay in summons, a failure to state the charges in advance and a lack of access to documents and \"Witness X\". On 5 January 2010, the French Tribunal de Grande Instance overturned his ban, and awarded him €15,000 in compensation. Symonds' ban was also overturned, and he was awarded €5,000 in compensation. Briatore was believed to be suing the FIA for damages in addition to getting his ban overturned, and has also stated his intention to pursue legal action against the Piquet family.\n\nOn 11 January 2010, the FIA announced that they would appeal the decision of the Tribunal de Grande Instance to overturn the bans imposed on Flavio Briatore and Pat Symonds. The FIA reinstated the bans while the appeal was active, but stated that drivers managed by Briatore would be granted their superlicences for 2010. On 12 April, the FIA announced a settlement with Briatore and Symonds, and that the legal action had been ended. Both men agreed not to work in Formula One until 2013, nor any other FIA-sanctioned championship until the end of 2011.\n\nOn 7 December 2010 it was announced that Nelson Piquet Jr and his father had won a libel case against Renault at the High Court based on the allegations described above. Renault apologised to the Piquets and paid them substantial damages. Admitting they libelled the duo, a Renault statement read: \"The team accepts, as it did before the World Motor Sport Council, that the allegations made by Nelson Piquet Junior were not false. As a result, these serious allegations contained in our press release were wholly untrue and unfounded, and we withdraw them unequivocally. We would like to apologise unreservedly to Mr Piquet Junior and his father for the distress and embarrassment caused as a result. As a mark of the sincerity of our apology and regret, we have agreed to pay them a substantial amount of damages for libel as well as their costs, and have undertaken not to repeat these allegations at any time in the future. It also accepts that Mr Piquet Junior and his father did not invent these allegations to blackmail the team into allowing him to drive for them for the remainder of the 2009 season.\"\n\nIt was suggested in the media that if Briatore were personally found guilty of race-fixing, he might fail the English Football League's Fit and proper person test which applies to football club owners and directors, whose regulations exclude people who are \"subject to a ban from a sports governing body relating to the administration of their sport\", though a BBC report opined that his position might be secure given that he had left Renault. The Football League stated that they would wait for the conclusion of the investigation before examining Briatore's fitness to continue to be a director of Queens Park Rangers F.C.. The Football League board discussed the matter on 8 October 2009 and declared that they would be awaiting a response from Briatore to various questions before commenting further.\n\nIn addition to any sporting sanctions by the FIA, Renault, Piquet Jr. or even Felipe Massa could take legal action over the incident. It was speculated by the media that Briatore and Symonds could be extradited to Singapore to face criminal charges relating to the incident, which according to one lawyer could encompass \"causing malicious or willful damage to property, endangering a vehicle and criminal conspiracy to commit a serious crime\". This was thought to be unlikely however, with the Singaporean authorities believed to be unwilling to attract the negative publicity charges it would create, and also complicated by the fact that Singapore has an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (Symonds being a British citizen) but not Italy (Briatore being an Italian citizen).\n\nPiquet Jr. was criticised by many in the community and some suggest that the controversy effectively ended his hopes of continuing in F1. BBC F1 commentator Martin Brundle suggested that Piquet Jr. was now unemployable in Formula One, saying that no team or sponsor would want to be associated with the Piquet family. Brundle noted that Piquet Jr. \"didn't deliver at Renault, he wasn't fast enough, that's why he was released and that's why he has dropped hand grenades into the system ever since\". Brundle was also highly critical that Piquet Jr. escaped sanction from the FIA despite admitting to race-fixing, while the others involved were heavily punished. Other leading F1 figures have echoed Brundle's sentiments. Toyota team principal John Howett was quoted as saying, \"I think on his performance...disregarding the issue, I probably would not give him a drive and I would probably be further influenced in that decision by what took place.\" Christian Horner, team principal of Red Bull Racing, has added, \"I don't think we would have any interest [in Piquet Jr.] at Red Bull Racing.\"\n\nPiquet Jr. has since joined America's NASCAR circuit, starting in the Camping World Truck Series and Nationwide Series in 2010. He drove for Turner Scott Motorsports part-time in the #30 Chevrolet Silverado in the Camping World Truck Series and full-time in the #30 Chevrolet Camaro in the Nationwide Series. In 2014-2015 Piquet Jr. took part in the inaugural Formula E season with China Racing, eventually becoming Formula E's inaugural champion by a single point over Sébastien Buemi.\n\n\n"}

Rimonabant is an inverse agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1 and was the first drug approved in that class.\n\nRimonabant is a selective CB1 receptor blocker and was discovered and developed by Sanofi-Aventis;\n\nOn 21 June 2006, the European Commission approved the sale of rimonabant in the then-25-member European Union as a prescription drug for use in conjunction with diet and exercise for patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m², or patients with a BMI greater than 27 kg/m² with associated risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia. It was first in its class to be approved anywhere in the world.\n\nRimonabant was submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval in the United States in 2005; in 2007, the FDA's Endocrine and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee (EMDAC) concluded that Sanofi-Aventis failed to demonstrate the safety of rimonabant and voted against recommending the anti-obesity treatment for approval and two weeks later the company withdrew the application.\n\nThe drug was approved in Brazil in April 2007.\n\nIn October 2008, the European Medicines Agency recommended the suspension of Acomplia after the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had determined that the risks of Acomplia outweighed its benefits due to the risk of serious psychiatric problems, including suicide. In November 2008 an advisory committee in Brazil recommended suspension as well, and that month Sanofi-Aventis suspended sale of the drug worldwide. The EMA approval was withdrawn in January 2009. In 2009 India prohibited the manufacture and sale of the drug.\n\nData from clinical trials submitted to regulatory authorities showed that rimonabant caused depressive disorders or mood alterations in up to 10% of subjects and suicidal ideation in around 1%, and in Europe it was contraindicated for people with any psychiatric disorder, including depressed or suicidal individuals.\n\nAdditionally, nausea and upper respiratory tract infections were very common (occurring in more than 10% of people) adverse effects; common adverse effects (occurring in between 1% and 10% of people) included gastroenteritis, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and other sleep disorders, hot flushes, diarrhea, vomiting, dry or itchy skin, tendonitis, muscle cramps and spasms, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and increased risk of falling.\n\nThe FDA's advisory committee raised concerns that based on animal data, it appeared that the therapeutic window with regard to CNS toxicity, and specifically seizures was almost nonexistent; the therapeutic dose and the dose that caused seizures in animals appeared to be the same.\n\nWhen the EMA reviewed postmarketing surveillance data, it found that the risk of psychiatric disorders in people taking rimonabant was doubled.\n\nThe chemical synthesis of rimonabant is described as follows:\n\nAlong with the clinical trials in obesity that generated the data submitted to regulatory authorities, rimonabant was also studied in clinical trials as a potential treatment for other conditions, including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and smoking cessation.\n"}

Lewis\n\nRobert Alvin Lewis (October 18, 1917 – June 18, 1983) was a United States Army Air Forces officer serving in the Pacific Theatre during World War II. He was the co-pilot of the \"Enola Gay\", the B-29 Superfortress bomber which dropped the atomic bomb Little Boy on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.\n\nLewis grew up in Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, and attended Ridgefield Park High School, graduating in 1937. During World War II, he had to wait after enlisting to be processed into the USAAF Officer Candidate School (OCS). Lewis went on to be a multi-engine test pilot in B-24, B-26, B-17 and B-29 bombers, which later led to him as co-pilot and his crew being selected for the Hiroshima bombing mission.\n\nLewis was field promoted to captain by General Curtis LeMay after demonstrating the B-29 and training the general on how to fly it. LeMay addressed Lieutenant Lewis as \"Captain Lewis\" on the field at the conclusion of several days of training and testing. Lewis tried to correct the general as to his rank, but LeMay insisted on captain, with the field commission arriving several weeks later by USAAF mail to him based in the midwestern US at the time.\n\nLewis was always a \"crew-first\" pilot who survived two crashes due to electrical failure and engine failure. Articles from New York City area newspapers attested to his \"cool head under stressful conditions\", ultimately leading to his selection as captain of a B-29 crew. Lewis led hundreds of bombing runs from Utah to Salton Sea in California leading up to his selection with his crew by Colonel Paul Tibbets. In early June, Lewis and his co-pilot Dick McNamara flew the entire crew and support crew from Utah to Tinian, in the B-29 specially modified to carry Little Boy to Japan from the huge Tinian base that General LeMay controlled from Guam.\n\nOn August 6, 1945 – August 5 in the United States, due to the time difference – Lewis was the co-pilot of the \"Enola Gay\" when it dropped Little Boy on Hiroshima. Normally the aircraft commander assigned to the \"Enola Gay\", for this important mission he acted as co-pilot, assisting \"Enola Gay\"'s new aircraft commander, Colonel Tibbets. Lewis and his crew, minus their original co-pilot Dick McNamara, were Tibbet's crew for the mission, and it included two specialists for the arming of Little Boy, the uranium-235 fission bomb.\n\nThe entire story was written by Lewis just before his death in 1983. His log, the only minute-by-minute recording on paper by any crew member that day, is part of his copyrighted historical manuscript. His sons and daughter are in the process of publishing the manuscript before the 75th anniversary of the bombing in 2020.\n\nAfter the war, Lewis became a pilot for American Overseas Airlines, specializing in the New York to London routes. He left in 1947 to rejoin his prewar employer, the Henry Heide Candy Company, where he became plant manager and personnel director of their factory in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was granted at least three patents during his time at Heide. In the 1950s, Lewis lived with his family in a home that he had built in Old Tappan, New Jersey. He and his wife had a daughter and four sons.\n\nIn New York City in 1951, Lewis met Hiroshima survivor Father Hubert Schiffer, who was eight blocks from ground zero when the explosion occurred and was seriously injured. Schiffer invited Lewis to visit Hiroshima in August 1952 for the dedication of a \"palace of prayer\", which Lewis accepted; however, there is no record of Lewis actually making such a visit. The two also appeared together at Fordham University in 1957, on the twelfth anniversary of the bombing, with Schiffer noting that they had become \"very fast friends.\"\n\nIn 1955, Lewis appeared on the television show \"This is Your Life\", in an episode not without controversy. The show had as its guest Reverend Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who had been living in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing and survived the explosion, as recounted in John Hersey's 1946 book \"Hiroshima\". Tanimoto had traveled to the United States with the Hiroshima Maidens to get reconstructive surgery for them, and while there was the subject of the May 11 episode of \"This Is Your Life.\" After some acquaintances were introduced and interviewed, a surprise for Tanimoto was meeting Lewis – on live television broadcast to a nationwide audience – representing the crew of the aircraft that had so dramatically changed his life. Contemporary reaction to the episode was mixed, ranging from \"one of [the] best\" to a \"new low in poor taste.\" Lewis described the \"Enola Gay\"'s flight and the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima. When asked by host Ralph Edwards if he remembered his reaction on that fateful day, he remarked, \"I wrote down later, 'My God, what have we done?' \"\n\nLewis became a self-taught stone sculptor, working in marble and alabaster, following a business trip to Florence where he saw some apprentices at work. One of his sculptures, titled \"‘God’s Wind’ at Hiroshima?\", depicted a mushroom cloud. In the 1970s, Lewis lived in a small cottage on West Shore Trail in the quiet Lake Mohawk community of Sparta, New Jersey.\n\nIn 1971, Lewis sold his manuscript log from the Hiroshima mission, which he had written during the flight at the request of journalist William L. Laurence; it was auctioned by Christies and sold for $37,000. The manuscript was later resold to Malcolm Forbes, and after Forbes' death was purchased by an anonymous buyer. Prior to the 1971 sale, Lewis made six hand-written copies of the log, one each for his wife and five children; one copy was sold in 2015 for $50,000.\n\nIn 1975, Lewis took a position with the Estee Candy Corporation, until his retirement in 1981. He was portrayed by Gregory Harrison in the 1980 television film \"Enola Gay: The Men, the Mission, the Atomic Bomb\". Lewis lived in Smithfield, Virginia, for two years before his death in 1983 of a heart attack at home; he was declared dead at Riverside Hospital in Newport News, Virginia.\n\nIn 1990, Lewis' widow put up for auction a manuscript navigator's log from the Hiroshima mission, however it failed to sell after questions arose about its authenticity, with \"Enola Gay\" navigator Theodore Van Kirk stating that he still had the log he wrote during the mission.\n\n\n"}

He was a political advisor to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. In March 2018, Nunberg was subpoenaed by a grand jury for testimony and documents relating to the Special Counsel's Russia investigation.\n\nNunberg was born to a Jewish family; his mother was a corporate attorney at Wachtell, Lipton and his father was a real estate attorney who worked with Trump attorney Gerald Schrager. He attended the Ramaz School an independent co-educational Modern Orthodox Jewish prep school in the Upper East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. He graduated with a BA in History from McGill University in 2004. He attended Touro Law Center on Long Island, New York, from 2007 to 2009, graduating in 2009, and was admitted to the New York state bar in 2013. \n\nWhile working as a volunteer for the Mitt Romney 2008 presidential campaign, Nunberg met and was hired by attorney Jay Sekulow to work at the American Center for Law & Justice in an attempt to stop the construction of the Park51 mosque. While working there he met political operative Roger Stone, whom he has described as his mentor and \"surrogate father\".\n\nNunberg began working for Trump, as a consultant, in 2011, after Trump decided not to run for president in 2012. Nunberg assisted in the writing of Trump's 2011 speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference. His other work during the period included being the director of the Middle East Forum's Legal Project from January 2012 to November 2014.\n\nAfter being hired by Trump, Nunberg told friends that the more that Trump considered a presidential run, the more consulting work for Stone and him. In February 2014 Nunberg was fired by Trump after he arranged a BuzzFeed interview that ended up being highly critical of Trump; the headline was \"36 Hours on The Fake Campaign Trail with Donald Trump.\" In February 2015 he was rehired by Trump, as a communications adviser for the Trump campaign, but was let go, shortly thereafter, by then-campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\nNunberg was rehired by the campaign in April 2015; between then and the beginning of July he was paid $15,139 by the campaign. Nunberg, along with Stone, helped prepare Trump for the first Republican debate, on August 6, 2015. Nunberg was fired at the end of July after old Facebook posts which contained racist comments were published. In March 2016 Nunberg endorsed Senator Ted Cruz for president, saying that Trump \"does not have a coherent political ideology.\"\n\nIn July 2016 Trump sued Nunberg for $10 million, accusing Nunberg of violating a confidentiality agreement by leaking information to the \"New York Post\". In a legal response, Nunberg said that Trump might have illegally funneled corporate money into the campaign. Trump and Nunberg settled their legal dispute in August 2016.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, Nunberg spoke to multiple cable news outlets and newspaper reporters without the knowledge of his attorney. He said he had been subpoened by a grand jury to testify and provide documents relating to Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, including all his email exchanges with Donald Trump, Roger Stone, and eight other people. He insisted he did not intend to comply with the subpoena, saying \"Let him (Mueller) arrest me!\" He also had in-person interviews with \"CNN's\" Jake Tapper and Erin Burnett and \"MSNBC's\" Katy Tur and Ari Melber. He later backtracked, saying that he would cooperate fully with the subpoena, while expressing frustration at the large amount of documentation requested. On March 9, 2018 Nunberg testified before a federal grand jury for more than six hours, saying it was his, \"duty as an American, whether I like it or not.\"\n\nRegarding the Mueller investigation, when asked whether he believed that the special counsel may have something on Trump, Nunberg responded, \"I think they may.\" He added: \"I think that he may have done something during the election. But I don't know that for sure.\" He also said \"I have no knowledge or involvement in Russian collusion or any other inappropriate act\" and that: \"Donald Trump won this election on his own. He campaigned his ass off. And there is nobody who hates him more than me.\"\n\nRegarding Trump's former foreign-policy advisor Carter Page, Nunberg said that he believed that Page did collude with the Russians.\"\n\nOn July 13, 2018, Nunberg spoke to Ari Melber who asked Nunberg, \"People in politics say we knew there was hacking, but the man you used to work for, Donald Trump, and many people around him doubt about how it happened, whether it mattered. Do you think today's indictment, which Donald Trump was briefed on, should change his mind about undermining both the fact that the Russians did this and attacking the probe?\" Nunberg replies with, \"First of all I think this should change the mind of any Republican voter that doesn't want Donald Trump to be impeached.\"\n"}

It was inaugurated on January 1, 1899 under the name Teatro Renacimiento. In 1973 it was re-inaugurated with its current name. It is located at number 24 in the Donceles Street, in the Centro Histórico de la Ciudad de México\n\nIn the place where the theater is located was originally located the Gran Teatro Nacional. When it was demolished, the Teatro Renacimiento was built in its place. The theater was inaugurated on January 1, 1899. It is said that the inauguration was attended by the then President of Mexico Porfirio Díaz. But in 1906, the theater is acquired by businessman Francisco Cardona, who decides to rename it with the name of his wife, legendary Mexican actress and theater entrepreneur Virginia Fábregas. At that time was a novelty, since it was the first theater in the Mexican capital to own electric lighting. The theater lived a period of splendor at the beginning of the century. But in 1933, the theater began to lose its splendor and changed its name to Teatro Mexicano. However, due to unknown issues, the theater remained closed for several years and was about to be demolished.\n\nIn 1973, the theater was acquired and remodeled by Mexican actress and singer Irma Serrano \"La Tigresa\". The actress claims to have acquired the property at an auction of the cement company Anahuac. With an important investment, Serrano reactive the theater baptizing it with the present name. The theater was inaugurated with the controversial theatrical assembly \"Naná\", based on the homonymous novel of Emile Zola, and produced and carried out by Serrano. The work remained on the billboard with great success for a couple of years.\n\nFrom that moment, the theater becomes the forum for a series of controversial works produced and some also starring by \"La Tigresa\". Among them stand out montages like \"Lucrecia Borgia\" (1977) or \"Yocasta Reina\" (1978), among others.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the theater introduced the concept known as \"Midnight Theater\", created by producer and director Pablo Leder, which was based on works aimed at a strictly adult audience. This situation gave the theater a reputation of controversial and transgressor, although the theatrical montages stood out by a great quality in production.\n\nAt the end of 1980s, the theater gradually stopped performing plays. During 1990s, the venue opened its doors for certain seasons as a night club. In 2003, the theater reopens its doors to being rented by Serrano to the entrepreneur Enrique Vidal.\n\nHowever, after a series of conflicts, the enclosure closed its doors for the second time.\n\nSince then, the venue has reopened its doors for theatrical productions sporadically. In recent times the venue has also served as a space for musical events by bands and artists such as Victimas del Doctor Cerebro, Natalia Lafourcade. Gang Gang Dance and The Dresden Dolls.\n\nDue to its history and peculiar decorative style, the Teatro Fru Fru has also served as a space for the recording of music videos and films both national and foreign. Among them are \"Cantinflas\" (2014) by Sebastián del Amo and \"Spectre\" (2015), by Sam Mendes.\n\n\n\n"}

Later on it was announced that the result thrown out by the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission due to outside interference, ruling it a no-contest, but the decision was reversed the next day as AAA declared that L.A. Park had earned the rights to the name \"La Parka\" with his victory. However, three days later AAA announced that they would respect the Commission's decision and declared the match thrown out.\n\nThrough TNA and AAA partnership representatives appeared at this event including Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm), Atsushi Aoki and Go Shiozaki\n\nIn early 1992 Antonio Peña was working as a booker and storyline writer for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to \"lucha libre\". He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them the recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, later known simply as \"AAA\" or Triple A. After making a deal with the \"Televisa\" television network AAA held their first show in April, 1992. The following year Peña and AAA held their first Triplemanía event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's Super Bowl event, similar to the WWE's WrestleMania being the biggest show of the year. The 2010 Triplemanía was the 18th year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the 23rd overall show under the Triplemanía banner.\n\nThe Triplemanía XVIII show featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nThe \"Road to Triplemanía\" began at AAA's previous major event Rey de Reyes which featured the beginning of new storylines and major turning points in other ongoing feuds. The driving force leading into Triplemanía was the developing \"family feud\" between AAA president Joaquin Roldan and his son Dorian. At Rey de Reyes Dorian Roldan turned on his father and stated that \"a new era was about to begin\". Dorian Roldan sided with Konnan and his \"La Legión Extranjera\" and introduced the returning L.A. Park to the stunned audience. Following the \"Rey de Reyes\" event Dorian Roldan and Konnan introduced several \"outsiders\" who sided with \"La Legión\" including the Pro Wrestling Noah team of Takeshi Morishima and Taiji Ishimori who won the AAA World Tag Team Championship from \"La Hermandad 187\" (Nicho el Millonario and Joe Lider). Dorian Roldan was also instrumental in having Vampiro turn on Joaquin Roldan during an AAA show on April 18, 2010. During AAA's television taping on May 19, 2010 Dorian Roldan said that his father did not deserve to run AAA since he was not a blood relative of Antonio Peña like he was, just married into the family.\n\nIn one of the biggest stories of \"lucha libre\" in 2010 L.A. Park, the original La Parka, returned to AAA 13 years after he left the company on bad terms. In the intervening years then-AAA owner Antonio Peña had given the mask, outfit and ring name to a new wrestler, creating a second version of La Parka. Over the years AAA and the original Parka have been involved in a legal battle over the rights to the name, until reaching some sort of arrangement to work together again in 2010. L.A. Park's target from the first night has been the new La Parka, claiming that he was just a pale imitation. During an AAA show on March 19, 2010 L.A. Park attacked La Parka and threw him through a table. In order to maintain the illusion that L.A. Park did not actually work for AAA, thus enhancing the tension between the two characters, L.A. Park later claimed that he came to AAA to beat up La Parka, and since he had done that on March 19 he wasn't sure if he even felt like returning to AAA. L.A. Park did however return to an AAA ring as he had another brawl with La Parka on AAA's April 18 television taping. During the event La Parka challenged L.A. Park to a match at Triplemanía XVIII, under any stipulation that the original Parka wanted. During AAA's television taping on April 30, 2010 L.A. Park accepted La Parka's challenge for a match at Triplemanía XVIII. At an AAA press conference on May 12, 2010 it was announced that the match between the two would be for the rights to the name \"La Parka\". The two signed the official contract for the match during a television taping on May 19, 2010. After signing the contract Dorian Roldan had the police arrest La Parka for piracy by impersonating La Parka. He was released just in time to run in during the semi-main event to attack L.A. Park.\n\nAt Rey de Reyes Electroshock won the AAA Mega Championship by defeating Mr. Anderson and El Mesías. After the match Dr. Wagner Jr., leader of \"Los Wagnermaníacos\" a group Electroshock was part of, came to the ring to congratulate Electroshock, seemingly putting an end to the building tension between the two. On the March 19 show Dr. Wagner Jr. asked Electroshock to give him a shot at the title, something which Electroshock turned down but instead offered to fight him right then and there. After the two were separated by security it was clear that Electroshock was no longer part of \"Los Wagnermaniacos\". At a later show Silver King, Dr. Wagner Jr.'s brother, interfered in a fight between the two by attacking his brother, siding with Electroshock. Silver King stated that he chose friendship over family and was siding with Electroshock in the storyline. On April 26, 2010 AAA confirmed on their website that Electroshock would defend the title against Dr. Wagner Jr. In the lead up to the title match the two faced off in a Steel Cage match on May 19, 2010, a match that Electroshock won with the help of \"Los Maniacos\", Silver King and Último Gladiador. In the days before Triplemanía XVIII Silver King stated that their father, Dr. Wagner, had once told him that he was talented enough to not need the family name to make it in wrestling, while his brother needed all the help he could get, which was why he chose to give Dr. Wagner Jr. the family name.\n\nAt \"Héroes Inmortales III\" Sexy Star defeated Faby Apache, with the help of \"La Legión Extranjera\", to win the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship. Following the match Sexy Star joined \"La Legión\" and began systematically targeting Faby and her sister Mari Apache. At the 2009 Guerra de Titanes Sexy Star defeated Faby Apache in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\", hair vs. mask match forcing Faby Apache to have her hair cut after the match. During the winter of 2009 Cinthia Moreno returned to AAA and sided with the Apache sisters against \"La Legión\". At the 2010 \"Rey de Reyes\" show the Apaches and Moreno defeated \"La Legión\" representatives Sexy Star, Rain and Christina Von Eerie. During one interview Sexy Star claimed that the Apaches and Cintia Moreno were nothing but maids, which led to AAA booking a match between Cinthia Moreno, Faby and Mari Apache against Sexy Star, Rain and Jennifer Blade in a match where the person pinned or submitted would have to be the winning team's slave for a month.\n\nExtreme Tiger and Alex Koslov had been feuding for over a year, in a storyline that centered on the AAA Cruiserweight Championship. It began with Koslov becoming the first ever AAA Cruiserweight champion on May 23, 2009, only to lose the belt to Extreme Tiger 23 days later at Triplemanía XVII. Koslov regained the title at the 2009 \"Verano de Escandalo 2009\" after turning \"rúdo\". In the weeks following Verano de Escandalo, Koslov lost a match that lead to him being fired (in storyline terms) and the title was vacated. Tiger went on to win the vacant title, only to be the target of Koslov as he returned to AAA as part of \"La Legión Extranjera\". In April AAA announced that the AAA Cruiserweight Championship would be defended in a \"Four Nations\" battle featuring Extreme Tiger (Mexico), Alex Koslov (Russia), Christopher Daniels (United States of America) and Nosawa (Japan). Daniels made his AAA debut during AAA's April 30, 2010 television taping in a match where he ended up pinning Extreme Tiger. It was later announced that Jack Evans would replace Alex Koslov in the match, removing the \"Four Nations\" concept for the match.\n\nFor over a year \"rúdo\" (bad guy) referee Hijo del Tirantes had been helping the \"rúdos\" win matches, deliberately overlooking any cheating and helping them win by counting faster than referees are supposed to during pinfalls. In the spring of 2010 referee Pierro finally spoke out about the biased refereeing and tried to put a stop to it. During AAA's April 30, 2010 television taping it was announced that each referee would choose three wrestlers to represent them in a match at Triplemanía XVIII where the hair of the referee was on the line. The six men involved in the match were announced at AAA's press conference on May 12, 2010. Pierro's team consisted of Heavy Metal, Octagón and Pimpinela Escarlata, while Hijo del Tirante's team featured Alex Koslov, Chessman and Hernandez. The May 12, 2010 press conference confirmed two further matches and also announced that Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's (TNA) Abyss would wrestle on the show, but did not announce an opponent for him at that time. It was later announced that Abyss would team up with Cibernético to wrestle in an Extreme rules Tag Team match against El Zorro and Vampiro. The two further matches announced were for the AAA World Mini-Estrellas Championship and the AAA World Tag Team Championship respectively. The Mini-Estrellas title would be defended in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match featuring defending champion Mini Abismo Negro as well as Mini Charly Manson, Octagoncito, Mascarita Divina, Mini Psicosis, Mini Histeria and Mascarita Sagrada.\n\nThe AAA World Tag Team Championship match was originally scheduled to feature then-current champions Takeshi Morishima and Taiji Ishimori defending against TNA representatives Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) and the winners of a tag team match between former champions \"La Hermandad 187\" (Nicho and Joe Lider) and \"Los Maniacos\" (Silver King and Último Gladiador). The match between the two teams ended in a draw, which at the time left it unclear which team, if any of the teams would wrestle at Triplemanía XVIII. Two days later it was announced that both teams would wrestle at Triplemanía XVIII making the tag team title match a four-way match. On May 23, 2010 Go Shiozaki and Atsushi Aoki defeated Takeshi Morishima and Taiji Ishimori to win the AAA World Tag Team Championship during Pro Wrestling Noah's Navigation with Breeze - Day 1 show in Niigata, Niigata, Japan. As a result of the victory Shiozaki and Aoki would defend the titles in the four-way tag team championship match instead.\n\nOn May 27, 2010 during a press conference for the 2010 Lucha Libre Expo Silver King, Último Gladiador and Kenzo Suzuki showed up during International Wrestling Revolution Group's (IWRG) show to continue an AAA vs. IWRG storyline that had been building for approximately a month at that point in time by claiming that they would show up during IWRG's show at the Lucha Libre expo. A few days later IWRG booker Marco Moreno mentioned the possibility that the IWRG wreslers may repay the interruption by appearing at Triplemanía XVIII in some form. After months of speculations Dorian Roldan announced that AAA had begun to work with the \"Perros del Mal\" wrestling promotion, owned and operated by Perro Aguayo Jr. and that Los Perros del Mal would be in attendance for the Triplemanía XVIII event, although their specific role was not announced.\n\nIn addition to Triplemanía XVIII June 6, 2010 also saw several other wrestling events in Mexico, including AAA themselves promotion a show in Monterrey, Nuevo León that featured most of the AAA wrestlers not booked for Triplemanía XVIII as well as a number of local wrestlers. AAA's rival Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) held a major event of their own on the same night, in the same city as they presented Sin Salida in Arena México. IWRG also ran a show on June 6 which featured AAA representatives \"Real Fuerza Aérea\" members Aero Star, Laredo Kid and Super Fly defeating IWRG wrestlers Cerebro Negro, Freelance and Suicida, continuing the AAA vs. IWRG storyline.\nThe opening match of Triplemanía XVIII was the Tables, Ladders and Chairs match (TLC) for the AAA World Mini-Estrellas Championship, the first ever \"Mini-Estrellas\" TLC Match. In addition to the seven participants announced before the show the match also included La Parkita and Mini Chessman making it a nine-\"Mini-Estrellas\" match. Early in the match it became obvious that someone accidentally raised the title belt too high over the ring as the \"Minis\" were not able to reach it from the top of the ladders. At one point La Parkita powerbombed reigning champion Mini Abismo Negro out of the ring and through a table. Mini Histeria climbed the ladder and almost reached the championship belt, but Octagoncito stopped him and sent Mini Histeria through a table with a neckbreaker off the ladder, after which Mini Histeria was removed from the ring on a stretcher. In the end Octagoncito climbed the ladder to take the belt and became the new AAA World Mini-Estrellas Champion. After the match La Parkita was helped from the ring, favoring his shoulder. It was also reported that Mini Abismo Negro had to receive medical attention after the match.\n\nThe second match of the night was a Six-woman tag team match where the person pinned or submitted would have to serve as the slave of the winners for a month. \"La Legión Extranjera\" representatives Sexy Star, Rain and Jennifer Blade maintained the advantage in the night only through the biased refereeing of Hijo del Tirantes, who allowed \"La Legión\" to cheat repeatedly. After a while Mari Apache became fed up by Hijo del Tirantes' biased refereeing and landed a low blow on him. Blade took advantage of the distraction and hit Mari over the back of the head with a broomstick, earning the pinfall for her team. As a result of the loss Mari Apache will now be the servant of \"La Legión\" until July 6, 2010.\n\nIn the next match Silver King made his first official appearance under the name \"Silver Cain\", a way to get around Silver King not being allowed to wear his mask any more. During the introduction of the AAA World Tag Team Champions the announced mistakenly announced one of them Nosawa and then never introduced his partner. Throughout the match only Konnan, who was commentating the matches, knew the names of Atsushi Aoki and Go Shiozaki as well as who Beer Money, Inc. actually were. The champions were the first team eliminated when Joe Lider pinned Shiozaki following a double knee backbreaker. In the second fall Konnan left his announcing position, threw James Storm a steel chair and caused a distraction, which allowed him to hit Joe Lider with it and pin him for the second elimination. In the end Silver Cain pinned James Storm following a brainbuster to make \"Los Maniacos\" the new AAA World Tag Team Champions. Following the match \"Los Junior Capos\" (Máscara Año 2000 Jr. and Hijo de Cien Caras) from IWRG showed up and challenged the new tag team champions. This was the first time the IWRG vs. AAA rivalry was referenced on AAA television.\n\nAt this point the crowd was estimated to be about 85% capacity with people still entering, putting the attendance at around 17.000.\n\nThe fourth match, the \"Lucha de Apuesta\" for the hair of the referee, was surprisingly turned into a Steel Cage match without any build. The winning team would be the team where all three wrestlers first escaped the cage. Octagón was the first wrestler to escape the cage, quickly followed by Alex Koslov. Pimpinela Escarlata was almost out of the ring when he was stopped by Hernandez. Instead of fighting against Hernandez Escarlata surprised him with a big kiss, that distracted/disgusted Hernandez long enough for Escarlata to escape the cage. The Hernandez shocked the crowd by diving off the top of the cage onto the prone Heavy Metal before climbing out of the cage. This left Chessman and Heavy Metal in the cage. At one point Chessman had an opportunity to leave the cage, but instead opted to leap off the top of the cage for a moonsault, only for Heavy Metal to move at the last moment, sending Chessman crashing into the match. When Heavy Metal tried to climb out of the cage Hijo del Tirantes hit him with a chair to stop him from leaving the cage. Afterwards Chessman recovered enough to drag himself out of the ring, winning the match for his team. After the match El Pierro had all his hair shaved off.\n\nCibernético and Abyss fought Vampiro and El Zorro in the next match, a hardcore match that quickly saw the interference of \"La Legión\" members Chessman, Christopher Daniels, Alex Koslov, Nosawa and Hernandez. After a while Cibernetico and Abyss were able to fight \"La Legión\" off. Near the end of the match Vampiro got into an argument with Konnan, resulting in Konnan tossing a handful of white powder into Vampiro's face. Blinded Vampiro was an easy target for Cibernético's \"Garra Cibernetica\" (\"The Cybernetic Claw\"; a chokeslam) for the pin fall. After the match La Legión attacked the two again, but were fought off, then beaten down by Cibernético, with assist from \"La Hermandad 187\".\n\nExtreme Tiger defended the AAA Cruiserweight title against three challengers in the seventh match of the night. In one of the most dangerous moves of the nights Extreme Tiger leapt off the top rope executing a 450° splash to Nosawa, who was prone on the floor. Moments later Tiger eliminated Nosawa using a diving stomp. Later on a wrestler wearing an Extreme Tiger mask came to ringside, distracting the real Extreme Tiger long enough for Christopher Daniels to pin him and eliminate him. Following Extreme Tiger's elimination the imitator removed the Extreme Tiger mask, revealing himself to be Relámpago. Evans won the match by pinning Daniels following a corkscrew 450° splash to earn his first ever AAA Championship.\n\nThe match for the AAA Mega Championship had originally been scheduled to go on last, but instead it became the second to last match, giving the L.A. Park vs. La Parka match the final spot on the show. The crowd was firmly behind Dr. Wagner Jr. in the match, chanting for the \"Good Doctor\" throughout most of the match. The match began as a clean, scientific match with Wagner and Electroshock displaying a variety of mat wrestling, exchanging holds and moves. The crowd began booing the match, after watching the buildup to the match they were not pleased with the clean, mat based wrestling even though Dr. Wagner Jr. was in control of most of the match. Dr. Wagner Jr. almost won the match when he used the \"Wagner Driver\" (a sitout scoop slam piledriver) on Electroshock, only to see the champion kick out at the very last moment. Electroshock later applied his \"Electrolock\" (a kneeling abdominal stretch with a figure four leglock), the same move that had won him both the 2009 Rey de Reyes and the AAA Mega Championship. Dr. Wagner Jr. managed to hold on and escape the hold only to apply another \"Wagner Driver\" on Electroshock. Following the \"Wagner Driver\" Dr. Wagner Jr. was able to pin Electroshock and win the championship for a second time. Following the match Electroshock shook Dr. Wagner Jr.'s hand as a sign of respect and then left the ring. Moments later El Mesías, still recovering from shoulder surgery, came to the ring to present Dr. Wagner Jr. with the belt and shook his hand.\n\nThe final match of Triplemanía XVIII was the battle over the name La Parka. First out was L.A. Park, accompanied by Dorian Roldan who carried L.A. Park's trademark steel chair with him to the ring. La Parka was accompanied by AAA managing director Joaquin Roldan. Both wrestlers came out to the sounds of Michael Jackson's Thriller, although neither were in the mood to dance before the match. The crowd support was divided although more behind the \"rúdo\" L.A. Park than they were behind the \"técnico\" La Parka. Early in the match L.A. Park landed three hard chair shots to his opponent, knocking him out of the ring. While on the floor L.A. Park threw a table into the ring and then threw La Parka into the steel barrier outside the ring. L.A. Park then sprayed La Parka in the face with a fire extinguisher and threw him into the crowd. The two fought back and forth in the crowd, throwing all rules out of the window. During the fight both wrestlers tore at their opponent's masks, almost tearing them completely apart, they two also bled heavily midway through the match. When the two returned to the ring La Parka threw L.A. Park off the top with a superplex that sent L.A. Park crashing through the table. While the crowd was generally split 50/50 for most of the match the boos were overwhelming when La Parka tried to pin L.A. Park, making it clear what outcome most of the fans were hoping for. A few minutes later the referee was accidentally knocked out of the ring, giving L.A. Park the opportunity to use a tombstone piledriver, a move that is illegal in Lucha Libre. Joaquin Roldan entered the ring, when L.A. Park attempted to use a steel chair on La Parka. When L.A. Park teased using the chair on Joaquin instead, Dorian entered the ring to protest, but was pushed down by Park, who then hit Joaquin with the chair, which caused Dorian to turn on him, hitting him with a steel chair three times.\n\nSeconds later Halloween and Damián 666 from the Perros del Mal wrestling promotion ran to the ring to chase Dorian Roldan away. Then they dragged L.A. Park on top of La Parka before \"rúdo\" referee Hijo del Tirantes counted to three to give L.A. Park the victory. After the bell rings the rest of Los Perros del Mal, (Perro Aguayo Jr., Super Crazy, Hijo de L.A. Park, X-Fly, Black Warrior, Damián 666's son, Ragde and Pesadilla.) came to the ring to celebrate with L.A. Park who had won the rights to the name \"La Parka\". After a couple of minutes a group of AAA wrestlers led by Octagón came to ringside and in combination with the arena security managed to remove Los Perros del Mal from the ring. Marisela Roldan and the AAA wrestlers gave tribute to AAA founder Antonio Peña with Marisela promising that they would beat Los Perros del Mal. La Parka was taken from the ring on a stretcher, not having moved since L.A. Park applied the piledriver.\n\nThe show closed with a mini-concert by \"El Tri\", followed by Marisela Peña making the announcement that due to the interference from Los Perros del Mal the main event results had been thrown out and declared a no-contest. The following day, during the post-Triplemanía press conference Dorian Roldan announced that L.A. Park had indeed won the match and was now officially known as La Parka once again while AAA's La Parka would have to change his name.\n\nThe night after the show AAA held a press conference centered on Dorian Roldan apologizing to his mother Marisela Peña Roldan, making peace with her, turning \"técnico\" once more. The press conference also featured the unity of AAA with Konnan's \"La Legión Extranjera\" against a common enemy in the invading \"Los Perros del Mal\". While Konnan was reluctant to trust AAA after having feuded with them for the previous 4–5 years the invading Perros del Mal forced his hand. On June 10 AAA announced that it would respect Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission's decision to throw out the main event match between La Parka and L.A. Park and as a result both wrestlers would keep their names.\n\nThe event received mainly positive reviews from critics, although the main event received mixed reviews; on a one hand, praised by the match itself, like \"Grita Radio\" described how the main event was so emotional that fans were on their feet with their hearts in their throats and Laura Fuentes and Armando Gutierrez of \"Luchas 2000\" Magazine calling the main event as a \"memorable battle\". but heavily panned by the match's ending and the booking treatment on it.\n\nAn article in the Mexican newspaper Récord was very critical of the event, stating that it had started late, the fights were flat and that there was little public interest. The claims were refused by Super Luchas magazine publisher Jorge Ocampo, stating that the author of the event was anti-AAA since the event had started exactly on time, the time printed on the tickets and that the crowd was more into the event than they had been for a long time. Ocampo also cited other factual errors in the article, stating that the author knew very little about wrestling.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "111113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=111113", "title": "Villa Grove, Illinois", "text": "Villa Grove, Illinois\n\nVilla Grove is a city in Douglas County, Illinois, along the Embarras River. The population was 2,537 at the 2010 census.\n\nVilla Grove was chartered in 1903 after the area was recognized by the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad (C&EI) as being exactly halfway between Chicago and St. Louis. This made it a desirable location for a steam locomotive repair facility. Villa Grove later became the site of a C&EI division headquarters and roundhouse. \n\nVilla Grove was known for its Pancake Festivals in the 1940s, which drew crowds over 10,000. In the 1970s, the festival was replaced by the Ag Days celebration. \n\nIn 1923, Villa Grove's high school basketball team, the Blue Devils, defeated Rockford 32-29 to win the Illinois High School Boys Basketball Championship.\n\nVilla Grove's historic rail depot was demolished in the predawn hours of Friday, October 29, 1976 despite a city ordinance that was intended to protect the structure. The city later received reparation for the destruction.\n\nOn August 10, 2011, a 100-year-old vacant building on main street in Villa Grove was destroyed by a fire set by a two boys age 14 and 9. At least 15 fire departments responded to the blaze containing it to the original structure. The boys were ordered to pay $126,076 in restitution. The 14-year-old received 3 years probation, 30 days in jail and 100 hours of community service. The 9 year old received 2 years probation and 50 hours community service. State law prohibited jail time for the 9 year old. Adjacent businesses were temporarily displaced due to damage caused by smoke and heat.\n\nVilla Grove's location at the confluence of Jordan Slough and the Embarras River has resulted in flooding during the city's history. In January 1950, Villa Grove was isolated by flooding, more than 1/3 of the city was underwater and the Red Cross reported 100 families were homeless. Another flood in April 1994 left over half of the city's 1,000 homes flooded and the city's water supply was tainted. At one point, portions of main street were 6 feet underwater.\n\nAfter the severe flooding in 1994 and additional flooding in the following years, a program was implemented to purchase and demolish homes voluntarily from owners in the flood plain. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Illinois Emergency Management Agency (IEMA) used the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) to purchase 17 homes in two phases from 1995 to 2000. IEMA noted that when another flood occurred in June 2008, the 17 properties purchased would have again been flooded had they not been purchased and demolished. Additional plans were also made to purchase more flood prone properties after the 2008 flood. After flooding in April 2013, FEMA again provided funding to purchase and demolish eight more homes and one public building in Villa Grove under HMGP.\nVilla Grove is located at (39.863667, -88.159579). According to the 2010 census, Villa Grove has a total area of , of which (or 99.54%) is land and (or 0.46%) is water.\n\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,553 people, 1,033 households, and 727 families residing in the city. The population density was 1,711.1 people per square mile (661.6/km²). There were 1,084 housing units at an average density of 726.5 per square mile (280.9/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 98.08% White, 0.31% African American, 0.16% Native American, 0.08% Asian, 0.12% from other races, and 1.25% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.86% of the population.\n\nThere were 1,033 households out of which 33.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 54.4% were married couples living together, 10.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.6% were non-families. 26.4% of all households were made up of individuals and 13.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.46 and the average family size was 2.93.\n\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 26.1% under the age of 18, 7.9% from 18 to 24, 27.6% from 25 to 44, 22.8% from 45 to 64, and 15.7% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.6 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the city was $35,912, and the median income for a family was $41,722. Males had a median income of $35,099 versus $21,453 for females. The per capita income for the city was $16,504.
