It may be used as a reason to deny any insurance on such individuals.\n\nThe early work on this subject dates back to 1919, in a study by Greenwood and Woods, who studied workers at a British munitions factory and found that accidents were unevenly distributed among workers, with a relatively small proportion of workers accounting for most of the accidents.\nFurther work on accident-proneness was carried out in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\nThe subject is still being studied actively. Research into accident-proneness is of great interest in safety engineering, where human factors such as pilot error, or errors by nuclear plant operators, can have massive effects on the reliability and safety of a system.\nOne of the areas of most interest and more profound research is the Aeronautical area, where accidents have been reviewed from psychological and human factors, to mechanical and technical failures. There has been many conclusive studies, that present that human factor has great influence on the results of those occurrences.\n\nStatistical evidence clearly demonstrates that different individuals can have different rates of accidents from one another; for example, young male drivers are the group at highest risk for being involved in car accidents. There also seems to be substantial variation in personal accident rates between individuals.\n\nHowever, a number of studies have cast doubt on whether accident-proneness actually exists as a \"distinct, persistent and independently verifiable\" physiological or psychological syndrome. Although substantial research has been devoted to this subject, there still seems to be no conclusive evidence either for or against the existence of accident proneness in this sense.\n\nThe exact nature and causes of accident-proneness, assuming that it exists as a distinct entity, are unknown. Factors which have been considered as associated with accident-proneness have included absent-mindedness, clumsiness, carelessness, impulsivity, predisposition to risk-taking, and unconscious desires to create accidents as a way of achieving secondary gains.\nBroad studies on the speed and accuracy using a specially designed test sheet of finding a specific figure on various people as Japanese, Brazil born Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Filipinos, Thai and Central Americans with different educational backgrounds. The studies have revealed that educational background or study experience is the key factor of concentration capability. Screening new employees using this test gave drastic decrease of work accidents in several companies.\n\n\n"}

It was won by Kelly Clarkson. The first season was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman, the latter of whom left the show after the season ended.\n\nThe winner, Kelly Clarkson, signed with RCA Records, the label in partnership with American Idol's 19 Recordings. Immediately post-finale, Clarkson released two singles, including the coronation song, \"A Moment Like This\". \"A Moment Like This\" went on to break a thirty-eight-year-old record held by The Beatles for a song's biggest leap to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. It jumped up from number fifty-two to number one in just one week. She held that record for five years but she reclaimed that record back in 2009 with her hit single \"My Life Would Suck Without You\" when it jumped up from number ninety-seven to number one. Clarkson has enjoyed a successful recording career since winning, with multiple-platinum albums, a number of Top 10 hit singles and three Grammy Awards. Runner-up Justin Guarini also signed with RCA Records, eventually debuting an album in 2003 after the conclusion of season 2. RCA dropped him shortly after its debut. In addition to Clarkson and Guarini, also signed were Nikki McKibbin, Tamyra Gray, R. J. Helton, and Christina Christian.\n\nAfter the finale, a special show in Las Vegas was also shown on September 23, 2002 where all 30 of the contestants who made the judges' initial cut performed during in a two-hour concert.\n\nThe show inspired a 2003 musical film, \"From Justin to Kelly\", featuring Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini.\n\nAuditions were held in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Atlanta, and Seattle in the spring of 2002, and around 10,000 attended the auditions.\nOne of the more prominent auditioners this season was Tamika Bush who objected to the judges' critiques and their pronunciation of her name. She was later invited back to critique the contestants' semifinal performance. Kristin Holt who auditioned in Dallas was put through to the Hollywood rounds, but in her rush to embrace the judges, fell and slipped under the judges' table.\n\nKelly Clarkson was notable for being largely absent in the audition episode, and she remains the only winner whose audition was not aired in the original broadcast. The other top 10 finalists in Season 1 whose auditions were not shown were Nikki McKibbin and EJ Day.\n\nThere are usually three stages in the audition process in every season, the first stage being the open call audition advertised. In this stage those auditioning each sings briefly in groups of five in front of selectors, though some may be asked to sing further. Most of those who attended are eliminated at this stage with only a limited number of auditioners selected to proceed further. In the second round they sing in front the executive producers and more are eliminated. In some later years a further round may be added before this round of audition. In the last round those who survive the first two-stage sing in front of the judges and this is the audition shown on television. Those who gain at least two \"yes\" votes from the three judges then receive a golden ticket to Hollywood.\n\nIn the first season, the second and third stage of the audition may take place within a single day, but in the following seasons each stage of the audition may take place on separate days. The initial audition venue need not necessarily be the final audition venue in front of the judges, and in later seasons, up to three separate venues may be used for the auditions in each city. The venues and dates of the second audition in front of the producers are not specifically listed in these pages. In the early seasons, the entire audition process in each city took place within a relatively short span of time, 3 days in the case of Season 1, but became progressively extended in later seasons until the callback date may be many weeks after the initial auditions.\n\nThe Hollywood week rounds were held in Pasadena Civic Center where 121 contestants competed for a place in the finals. The contestants first emerged on stage in groups of nine or ten but performed solo unaccompanied, and those who did not impress the judges were cut after the group finished their individual performances. 65 were selected to proceed on to the next round. The singers were expected to learn their songs that night and perform the next day in groups of three. The girls and boys were separated and given crash course to learn their song, which was Dionne Warwick's \"I Say a Little Prayer\" for the girls and \"For Once in My Life\" for the boys. Many however frequently forgot the lyrics. Again those who failed to impress were cut immediately after their performance. 45 made it to the next round, and the 20 cut were given their last chance to voice their opinion to the judges before leaving.\n\nIn the final round, the remaining 45 were given new songs to learn and each performed solo and a cappella. 30 contestants were chosen after this round. The Top 15 were first announced, the judges then selected 15 more out of the remaining 30. The 30 were split into two groups and the judges then went to each group to announce the chosen group.\n\nDelano Cagnolatti was initially amongst those announced as the Top 30, but he was later disqualified for falsifying his age, and became the first person to be disqualified on \"American Idol\". He was replaced by EJay Day.\n\nThe 30 contestants who reached this stage in this season were referred to in the show as the finalists.\n\nBefore their performance, the contestants took part in intensive music workshop where they were given vocal coaching by Debra Byrd and advice by stylists. The contestants were held in the Red Room before they each emerged to perform solo with piano accompaniment. There was no studio audience at this stage and the performance was pre-taped. The audience voted after each round of performance, and the results of the vote were announced the next day live. A total of 3.3 million votes were cast in the first week of voting.\nBelow are the three semi-final groups with contestants listed in their performance order. In each group, three people advanced to the next round, based on votes by the viewers.\n\nFollowing those nine singers advancing, five of the remaining 21 semi-finalists were selected by the judges to compete in the Wild Card round. Following another performance by each Wild Card contender, the judges selected one contestant to advance to the final group of 10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finals were broadcast live, in front of a live studio audience. The finals lasted for eight weeks, each finalist performed a song or songs selected from a weekly theme. During the first few weeks, contestants sang one song each. By the top four week, the contestants sang two songs each, and in the finale the two finalists performed three songs apiece.\n\nThe results of public vote were revealed in the night following the performance night in the results show. The three or two contestants in the later rounds who received the lowest number of votes were typically called the Bottom Three or Two. From the bottom three, one contestant was sent to safety so that two contestants remained and finally the contestant who received the fewest votes was eliminated from the competition. A farewell video with montage of the eliminated contestant is shown.\n\nThis season largely set the pattern for later seasons, such as group performance by the contestants during the result shows, hometown visits for the top 3, and performing the songs for the top 2 that would be released immediately after the finale. In this season, there were no guest mentors apart from the Burt Bacharach week where the composer helped the contestants prepare their songs.\n\nThe finale was between Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, and Kelly Clarkson was declared the winner with 58% out of 15.5 million votes cast. Over 110 million votes were cast over the entire season.\n\nA television special from Las Vegas starring the top thirty-two finalists aired later, a thirty date tour with the top ten followed, as did the box office bomb movie titled \"From Justin to Kelly\".\n\n\n\n\n\nEach contestant sang two songs.\n\n\nEach contestant sang two songs.\n\nThe top 3 each reprised their performances -\n\nEach contestant sang three songs.\n\nIt was revealed during the season that around 100 phone-phreak hackers with power-dialing hardware and software were able to place as many as 10,000 votes a night from a single phone line with the touch of a button. However, FremantleMedia, which produces the show, contended that the hackers have had 'statistically insignificant' effect on the vote. Simon Cowell also insisted that Tamyra Gray's unexpected ouster from the show only strengthened the producers' contention that the voting was fair. Nevertheless, concerns were raised about possible unfairness in the situation of a tight vote. Ken Warwick later said in Season 5 that equipment was put in place afterwards to address this issue but it has never detected such a problem since.\n\nIdol contestants were reported to having to sign a 'phone book-thick' contract that gives producers 'sole discretion' to pick the winners and change the rules. Producer Nigel Lythgoe however said that the contracts had to anticipate every possible situation, and was not intended to rig the show in favor of any contestant.\n\nControversy erupted when the winner of Season 1, Kelly Clarkson, was invited to sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in a deal arranged by her then management company, 19 Entertainment, at a special commemoration for the first anniversary of 9/11 attacks at Washington's Lincoln Memorial. Some critics suggested that Clarkson's appearance would turn a somber occasion of national mourning into a \"giant promotional opportunity\". Kelly Clarkson herself considered withdrawing from the commemoration, saying \"I think it is a bad idea ... If anybody thinks I'm trying to market anything, well, that's awful.\" and added \"I am not going to do it.\" She was however unable to withdraw from the event.\n\n\nSeason one of \"American Idol\" was a surprise summer hit show of 2002 and had an average viewership of 12.7 million per episode. It was the summer’s highest-rated show in the 18/49 demographic.\n\nRe-edited episodes of American Idol season 1 are now being shown in syndication as \"American Idol Rewind\". The new episodes feature commentary from some of the first season's top 30, including Justin Guarini, Jim Verraros, Christina Christian, Nikki McKibbin, Angela Peel, and Kelli Glover. Rewind also showcases footage that was not seen in the initial run of season 1, including Kelly Clarkson's\nfull audition.\n\nSource:\n\n\n"}

The comet was observed to have broken up by 1846; further drift of the pieces by 1852 suggested the moment of breakup was in either 1842 or early 1843, when the comet was near Jupiter. The breakup led to particularly spectacular showers in subsequent cycles (particularly in 1872 and 1885).\n\nIn the early 19th century, before the break-up of comet 3D/Biela, the radiant was in Cassiopeia. In the last century the radiant of the modern weaker meteor shower is generally in the constellation of Andromeda as the name of the shower suggests, but due to its age and diffuseness meteors may appear to come from the neighbouring constellations, such as Pisces, Triangulum and Cassiopeia.\n\nThe first known sighting of the Andromedids was December 6, 1741, over St Petersburg, Russia. Further strong showers were witnessed in 1798, 1825, 1830, 1838 and 1847. The Andromedids produced spectacular displays of several thousand meteors per hour in 1872 and 1885, as a result of Earth crossing the comet's debris stream. Schmidt, observing from Athens, said that the 1872 shower consisted mainly of faint (5th to 6th magnitude) meteors with \"\"broad and smoke-like\" trains and a predominantly orange or reddish colouration. In England, Lowe estimated the same shower as producing at least 58,600 visible meteors between 5.50 and 10.30 pm, observed that the meteors were much slower than the Leonids, and noted noises \"like very distant gun-shots\"\" several times to the north-west. In Burma, the 1885 shower was perceived as a fateful omen and was indeed followed swiftly by the collapse of the Konbaung dynasty and the conquest by Britain.\n\nThe November 27, 1885, shower was the occasion of the first known photograph of a meteor, taken by Austro-Hungarian astronomer, Ladislaus Weinek, who caught a 7mm-long trail on a plate at his Prague observing station.\n\nSince the 19th century the Andromedids have faded so substantially that they are no longer generally visible to the naked eye, though some activity is still observable each year in mid-November given suitable detection equipment. In recent years, peak activity had been less than three meteors per hour, around November 9 to 14. Andromedid activity of November comes from the newest streams, while that of early December comes from the oldest.\n\nOn December 4, 2011, six Canadian radar stations detected 50 meteors in an hour. The activity was likely from the 1649 stream. On December 8, 2013, Meteor specialist Peter Brown reported that the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar had recorded an outburst from the Andromedid meteors in the past 24 hours. Scientists postulate a somewhat weaker return in 2018, but a yield of up to 200 meteors an hour in 2023. Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR) data also detected a spike of 30 meteors per hour on November 27, 2008.\n\nDuring the 2012 shower an inconspicuous maximum occurred on November 9.\n\n"}

With the threat of a public auction looming, the very proud and stubborn Frank, his family, and eccentric crew rally to save the business.\n\nFrank's son Michael, who works in the tech world of Seattle, and his girlfriend Kerry return home for Christmas and are dragged into the family drama. Michael’s childhood home has been sold, and his mother Maureen, who has separated from Frank and is hoping to establish her own identity apart from the business that has consumed her life, is scheduled to move into a rental house after the holidays. Over the course of two weeks, Michael finds himself sleeping on a pull-out couch with his father in Frank's office, catching wandering lobster crates in the bay, and trying to mend his relationship with Kerry after his father assaults her uncle. Meanwhile, his sister Lauren, who has worked with her father since graduating from college, is striving to keep the lines of communication open among all the family members.\n\nIn the end, Frank's longtime customer and friend Bill Lau offers the highest bid on the property, with the idea he and Frank will complete construction of the restaurant and operate it as partners.\n\nIn a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, Kevin and Darren Jordan discuss family events that inspired them to develop the film. In 1938, their grandfather established a seafood business on Bleecker Street in Manhattan, and later moved it to a waterfront location in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn where, under the name Jordan's Lobster Dock, it became a popular local landmark. Their father Bill decided to expand the operation by adding a restaurant, but midway through construction the bank that loaned him money to finance the project failed, and the FDIC demanded full repayment of the loan, placing the family in a financial bind.\n\nThe film was shot in less than five weeks on the actual site of the Jordan business, as well as in Chinatown and Rockville Centre. All members of Jordan's immediate family had cameo roles.\n\nThe film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Hamptons International Film Festival, the Avignon Film Festival, and the Bahamas International Film Festival. It went into theatrical release in the US on November 4, 2005 and earned $11,729 in two theaters on its opening weekend.

The actual solvent is largely irrelevant — more importantly, the polarity of the solvent must match the polarity of the dye in the ink. For example, an ink that is mostly made of a polar dye would require a polar solvent (e.g. acetone or isopropanol).

{"id": "3944949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3944949", "title": "Felling mine disasters", "text": "Felling mine disasters\n\nThe Felling Colliery (also known as Brandling Main) in Britain, suffered four disasters: 1812, 1813, 1821 and 1847. By far the worst of the four was the 1812 disaster which claimed 92 lives on 25 May 1812. The loss of life in the 1812 disaster was one of the motivators for the development of the miners' safety lamp.\n\nFelling, Tyne and Wear is now part of Gateshead but at the time of the disasters was a separate manor in what used to be County Durham. Mining of the upper seams had continued throughout the 18th century. Following borings starting in 1758, the main pit was opened in 1779. The first seam to be worked was the High Main which ceased production in 1811. Shortly before the High Main was exhausted, the pit was deepened to reach the Low Main which came into production in May 1811, just a year before the disaster. The Low Main lies below the surface and is thick. Subsequently two other seams, the Bensham (or Maudlin) and the Hutton were won.\n\nTo ensure adequate ventilation two shafts were dug, John Pit and William Pit. John Pit was the main access shaft and was the \"down-cast\" shaft where fresh air was drawn into the pit. A steam engine was provided for winding gear, and in 1812 there was a standby horse-whim for when the steam engine was out of use. William Pit was the \"up-cast\" or \"furnace\" pit and had a fire burning at its base. The rising hot air drew air though the mine from the down-cast pit. Above each of the two pits were pulleys, those over John Pit were in diameter. The pulleys for the horse-whim were mounted on a crane and kept out of the way, being swung over the pit mouth when required. This arrangement proved fortuitous in the aftermath of the disaster.\n\nFrom the base of the pits a number of headings were first driven. Between the headings were driven stentings. An excavated area was called a board, broken up by walls. To ensure the air circulated throughout the mine some boards were blocked off with stoppings either of brick or timber. Openings in some of the stoppings allowed the movement of men and materiel. When not being used the openings were closed by traps.\n\nIn an era before the invention of the safety lamp, the only practical source of light was a candle. Where explosive gas was suspected, a Spedding mill was used. A steel cylinder was revolved at high speed against a flint and the resulting shower of sparks gave some light. Although safer than candles, the Wallsend colliery explosion of 1785 had shown that mills could cause explosions.\n\nAt 11:30 on Monday, 25 May 1812 the first explosion occurred. For half a mile around the earth shook and the noise was heard up to four miles away. Large clouds of dust and small coals were thrown up from both William Pit and John Pit. As well as the small particles, the coal baskets and pieces of wood were blown out of the pits and landed nearby. The dust fell like a shower for up to a mile and a half downwind. The \"pit-heads\" or \"shaft-frames\" carrying the pulleys at both pits were blown off, set on fire and the pulleys broken. At William Pit the up-cast fed to a horizontal flue on the surface which led to a stack. Coal dust was distributed three inches thick within this flue which then burnt to a \"light cinder\".\n\nThe pulleys for the horse-whim at John Pit were mounted in a crane kept swung away from the shaft. As a result they were undamaged and could be swung over the shaft. Men on the surface applied themselves in place of the horses and brought 33 survivors and two corpses out of the colliery. Three of the survivors subsequently died. 87 men and boys were left below ground.\n\n45 minutes after the initial explosion, at 12:15, a rescue team descended the shaft. Because of the firedamp they used Spedding mills to light their way. It was noted that the sparks fell \"like dark drops of blood\" due to the foul air. Having attempted two directions and being forced back by difficulty breathing they retreated to the pit bottom. The party ascended, but while two were still below and two were in the shaft a second explosion occurred. Haswell and H. Anderson were the two left below and they hung onto a pit prop whilst the blast lifted them and turned them.\n\nThe rescue team all agreed that there was no possibility of the men left below ground being alive. Two explosions, blackdamp (locally called choak-damp), fire and the lethal afterdamp made any rescue attempt impossible. The suggestion was made that the pit be stopped up to extinguish the fire. However, local recollections of three men who had survived for 40 days in a pit near Byker led to shouts of \"Murder\" and obstruction.\n\nOn the following day, Tuesday, a crowd gathered around John Pit and accusations of cowardice were thrown around. Eventually the leaders of the crowd were won around. The owners offered \"no expense should be spared\" in executing and scheme of rescue but they refused to offer a reward since \"they would be accessary to no man's death by persuasion or a bribe\". William pit was closed over with planks.\n\nOn the Wednesday Mr Straker and William Haswell (the viewer and the overman) descended John Pit. The sparks from the Spedding mill were extinguished by the blackdamp and Haswell began staggering within due to the effects of the gas. Straker helped him to the shaft where it was still difficult to breathe even in the current of air. Two further men descended but could not move more than a few yards from the base of the shaft and their clothes had the smell of stinkdamp upon them. Smoke was seen ascending from John Pit, a sure sign of the fire below and so the base of John Pit was sealed with clay and planks laid over the mouth. Two days later William Pit was further sealed with clay.\n\nThe pit was cautiously reopened on 4 July. The issuing gas was collected in bladders and tested. At first it exploded when released near a candle flame but by 8 July it was diluted enough not to do so. The pits were then opened fully on the seventh and allowed to vent. In the morning of the eighth, Straker, Anderson, Haswell and six others descended William shaft and found the air cool and wholesome.\n\nWork on recovering the victims and securing the mine then started. All work was performed using Spedding mills for light. As the workers moved through the mine all the various stoppings and traps had to be repaired to force the air current to fully ventilate it.\n\nThe parish priest for Jarrow and Heworth was the Reverend John Hodgson (1779–1845). As well giving comfort to the bereaved, he was instrumental in persuading them to accept a common, speedy burial. The bodies had lain for seven weeks in the pit while the fires were extinguished and were badly decayed. Dr. Ramsay gave his opinion that if the bodies were returned to their homes for a normal wake and burial \"putrid fever\" might spread throughout the neighbourhood.\n\nBetween 8 July and 19 September the business of recovering the dead and repairing the mine continued. Hodgson details the decayed and putrid state of some of the corpses. The recovery teams placed the bodies in coffins in the mine, there was a fear that the bodies might fall apart.\n\nIdentification was a problem. Mothers and widows failed to identify most of the bodies \"they were too much mangled and scorched to retain any of their features\". Most were identified by clothes, tobacco-boxes, shoes and other items.\n\nFinally on Sunday 20 September 117 days after the explosion, the pit was inspected by candle light. The furnace below William Pit was relighted and the whole mine brought back into production. One body has never been found.\n\nThe cause of the first explosion is not known for certain. The most probable cause was firedamp, there being no evidence of large amounts of coal dust in the air, the other significant risk.\n\nAfter the first explosion the trap doors used for ventilation and the internal wall in the vicinity of the underground crane were observed to be in a good state by the men who escaped. Indeed, even the lamp at the crane was still burning. When the mine was reopened the area was found to damaged: \"the stoppings and trap-doors were blown down, the roof fallen and as great marks of destruction as in any other part of the mine\". The area was near John Pit, the down-cast shaft where fresh air was entering the mine at its greatest velocity. Hodgson realised that this was significant and supposed that \"the atmospheric current ... intercepted the progress of the first explosion, and prevented it from igniting the fire damp here\".\n\nHodgson then proceeds to assume that the \"choak-damp\", perhaps here thinking of afterdamp rather than blackdamp, pressing upwards from the seat of the explosion forced a pocket of firedamp to where the coal was burning and set off the second explosion. However two paragraphs down he observes that the dust in the barrow-ways was burnt to a cinder. That coal dust raised by an initial explosion could be the cause of a further explosion was only starting to be understood in this period.\n\nThe tragedy inspired Hodgson to raise public concern about the hazards of mining. Public interest was fed by a short (16-page) pamphlet written by him and published prior to the second disaster in late 1813. Hodgson wrote for an interested public, not for practical miners, and as such explains mining terms and procedures. His description and analysis of the two explosions was historically significant as one of the first to attempt a scientific analysis of such events.\n\nOn 1 October 1812 the Sunderland Society was set up consisting of clergymen, doctors, owners and mine managers. One of the doctors was William Reid Clanny (1776-1850) who had already produced a first, impractical, safety lamp. Also present was George Stephenson who at that time was enginewright for the collieries at Killingworth. The society aimed for:\n\nStephenson designed a safety lamp, known as the Geordie lamp, with air fed through narrow tubes, down which a flame could not move. It also led Sir Humphry Davy to devise another safety lamp, the Davy lamp, in which the flame was surrounded by iron gauze. The gauze had to have small spaces so that a flame could not pass through, but could admit methane, which then burned harmlessly inside the lamp. The height of the luminous cone above the flame gave a measure of the methane concentration in the atmosphere.\n\nOn 24 December 1813 at 01:30 the colliery again exploded, this time with the loss of 9 men and 13 boys along with 12 horses. All the dead were in the headways by William Pit (the upcast pit). Those in the boards away from William Pit were saved. The reported the supposition that \"the hydrogen took fire at the crane lamp, in the south headways\". Thomson also reports this but warns against too early an assumption, mentioning other possibilities such as the failure of a stopping or furnace mismanagement.\n\nThe southern boards were crossed by several fissures (dykes) from which periodic discharges of gas came through apertures called blowers. The blowers could make \"the coals on the floor dance round their orifices, like gravel in a strong spring\". The discharges were dealt with by the strong current of air, strong enough to extinguish candles.\n\nNone of the mine was found to be damaged by fire so after retrieval of the bodies and inspection of the mine it was reopened. On 30 December workmen found fire in part of the waste and as a result the mouths of the shafts were stopped up for a while.\nOn Tuesday 22 June 1847, shortly after 21:00, another explosion occurred at Felling Colliery. Six miners were killed, four outright and two died of their injuries over the following two days. The surgeon employed by the mine owners tried, unsuccessfully, to treat the injured. Two of the dead were killed immediately by a fall of rock from the roof, the other two by afterdamp. As well as the human cost, eighteen horses were killed either by the explosion or by the afterdamp.\n\nOne of the survivors, Peter Gibbon, saw from his safety lamp that the air quality had changed. He commented to the man he was working with, George Chapman, \"Do ye mind what a current of air there was!\". Chapman had not noticed anything, but being at that time in charge of the pit he went off to investigate. Chapman was subsequently rescued, but died the following day. After an hour Gibbon tried to escape but broke his lamp and in the darkness was blocked by a roof fall. He was eventually rescued. That, although significant damage was done, some of the men neither heard nor felt and shock was commented upon in newspaper reports.\n\nThe viewer, Mr Foster, stated to the Newcastle Guardian that Davy lamps were employed throughout the colliery and that all the men were given written instructions in their use. The old areas of the colliery released a lot of foul air, but there was \"not a better ventilated colliery on the Tyne\". Foster reported that per minute was drawn down the shaft, a fact confirmed at the coroner's inquest by Mr Foster, the viewer.\n\nThe colliery overman, John Greener, told the coroner that he had gone down the pit after the explosion and \"found the separation stoppings blown down, and the stables on fire\". He penetrated up to from the shaft before being overcome by foul air and forced to retreat and go home.\n\nOn the Thursday evening, two days later a coroner's inquest was opened and adjourned until a full inspection could take place. The inquest reopened on the following Wednesday. The principal witness was the viewer, Mr Thomas Forster. He confirmed much that had earlier been reported; the pit was well ventilated and Davy lamps were in use.\n\nThe seat of the explosion was found by Mr Foster to be an underground engine used to haul coals to the pit base. The engineman had added fresh coal to the fire and closed the damper before going off shift at 16:00. The damper should have remained slightly open to allow burnt gas from the fire to escape up the chimney. It was supposed that the damper had been closed fully and partial combustion had occurred effectively generating town gas (\"acting as a retort\"). The gas eventually escaped and the resultant explosion caused major damage to the boiler and flue.\n\nFour viewers from other pits all corroborated Foster's conclusions. The engineman, George Hope, said that he put on around 3½ pecks of small coals and \"left the damper open about an inch and three-quarters I always leave my fire this way\". The coroner's jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental Death\". The jury recommended that a pin was placed in the damper so stop it closing to less than four inches ().\n\nA memorial to the 91 victims was placed in St Mary's Churchyard where most of the coffins were placed in a common grave. The monument has a square base with a square pyramid above.

{"id": "19360092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19360092", "title": "Jenkem", "text": "Jenkem\n\nJenkem is an inhalant and hallucinogen created from fermented human waste. In the mid-1990s, it was reported to be a popular street drug among Zambian street children. They would put the feces and urine in a jar and cover it with a balloon then let it ferment out in the sun, then afterwards they would inhale the fumes created. In November 2007, there was a moral panic in the United States after widespread reports of jenkem becoming a popular recreational drug in middle and high schools, though the true extent of the practice has since been called into question. Several sources reported that the increase in American media coverage was based on a hoax and on faulty Internet research.\n\nThe name derives from Genkem, a brand of glues which had \"become the generic name for all the glues used by glue-sniffing children\" in South Africa, where the drug originated and is most popular on the African continent today. In the book \"Children of AIDS: Africa's Orphan Crisis\" by Emma Guest, the making of jenkem is described: \"fermented human sewage, scraped from pipes and stored in plastic bags for a week or so, until it gives off numbing, intoxicating fumes.\" The process is similarly described in a 1995 IPS report: \"Human excreta is scooped up from the edges of the sewer ponds in old cans and containers which are covered with a polyethylene bag and left to stew or ferment for a week.\" A 1999 BBC article refers to \"the dark brown sludge, gathering up fistfuls and stuffing it into small plastic bottles. They tap the bottles on the ground, taking care to leave enough room for methane to form at the top.\"\n\nThe effects of jenkem inhalation last for around an hour and consist of auditory and visual hallucinations for some users. In 1995, one user told a reporter it is \"more potent than cannabis.\" A 1999 report interviewed a user, who said, \"With glue, I just hear voices in my head. But with jenkem, I see visions. I see my mother who is dead and I forget about the problems in my life.\" Fumito Ichinose, an anesthesia specialist in Boston who conducted a study on the effects of hydrogen sulfide gas, or \"sewer gas,\" on mice, informed Salon.com that holding your breath, choking, or \"the inhalation of gases like those produced from jenkem could result in hypoxia, a lack of oxygen flow to the body that could be alternately euphoric and physically dangerous.\"\n\nThe second media description of jenkem came from an Inter Press Service wire report in 1995. According to a 1998 report in \"The New York Times\", Fountain of Hope, a non-profit organization, said that jenkem was used by street children in Lusaka, Zambia to obtain a \"powerful high\". In 2002, Project Concern International Zambia and Fountain of Hope released a report entitled \"Rapid Assessment of Street Children In Lusaka\", where jenkem is listed as the third most popular drug among Lusaka's street children, following Dagga (Cannabis) and \"glue and Dagga\" but ahead of \"Ballan\" (uncured tobacco) and petrol.\nJohn C. Zulu, director of the Ministry of Sport, Youth and Child Development in Zambia, said in November 2007 that jenkem usage is less common than glue-sniffing and, \"Initially, they used to get it from the sewer, but they make it anywhere ... They say it keeps them warm and makes them fearless.\" In 1999, BBC News ran a story about jenkem. In 2004, South African weekly investigative newspaper \"Mail & Guardian\" mentioned jenkem abuse in a report on Zambia's street children.\n\nOn September 26, 2007, the Sheriff's Department of Collier County, Florida issued an internal bulletin about jenkem based on a TOTSE internet forum post by user \"Pickwick\", which included purported photos of the manufacture and use. \"Pickwick\" confessed it was a hoax around the time of the internal bulletin. In November of that year, officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration said no reports of jenkem use had been confirmed in the United States.\n\nAfter initially classifying stories of Western jenkem use as \"undetermined\", Snopes quickly reclassified it as \"false\". About.com also concluded reports were \"based on faulty Internet research\". The Smoking Gun stated the Collier County alert \"may be full of shit\". Drug research site Erowid reported, \"the jenkem stories that have been circulating in the U.S. media are almost certainly the strange result of a hoax.\"\n\nJenkem use was reported uncritically by KIMT of Mason City, Iowa, WIFR-TV in Rockford, Illinois, and WINK NEWS Fort Myers, Florida. \"Washington Post\" columnist Emil Steiner reported that \"a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration insists that 'there are people in America trying [jenkem],'\" which the DEA agent characterized as \"dangerous, bad and stupid.\" Fox News ran the story after the Steiner \"Washington Post\" column, mentioning Pickwick's hoax and retraction. In the same article, a Washington D.C. DEA spokesman, Garrison Courtney, specified that, \"We wouldn't classify it as a drug so much because it's feces and urine.\" UK technology tabloid website \"The Register\" concluded that \"the jury's out.\" ABC News interviewed DEA spokesman Garrison Courtney, who stated that, \"It is in Africa, we know that... We've heard rumors and speculation about it here, but part of looking for trends is listening first for speculation. It is something we want to keep on top of.\"\n\nWSBT-TV in South Bend, Indiana advised parents to \"wait up for [their children] at night and not let their kids go to bed until they have seen them and smelled their breath.\" Austin, Texas NBC affiliate KXAN-TV interviewed a local teen, whose parent speculated on its use: \"Once it becomes OK with a certain group of adolescents, it becomes OK with a lot more.\" Australian broadcaster ninemsn summarized American news reports. A syndicated report published on the web pages of CBS affiliate CBS-47 and Fox affiliate Fox 30, both in Jacksonville, Florida, reported on jenkem and also referred to it by the slang term \"butt hash\", citing media reports from the \"Washington Post\", the Drudge Report, and Inside Edition. This was also followed up by a Fox 30 televised news segment, in which Captain Tim Guerrette of the Collier County Sheriff's department was interviewed. A Florida syndicated newspaper article focused on the leaked police memo and included interviews with DEA spokesman Rusty Payne, the Palmetto Ridge High School principal, and a spokeswoman for the Collier County Health Department.\n\nJamie Pietras of Salon.com published a long piece on jenkem in 2007. Pietras interviewed a Zambian government official on ways to curtail use and also focused on the Western media scare. Pietras interviewed researcher Earth Erowid of Erowid, and Jag Davies, the communications director for the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), neither of whom could provide any confirmation of its use in America. Partnership for a Drug-Free America public affairs representative Candice Besson also stated that PDFA had not previously heard about the drug.\n\n\"The Enterprise Ledger\" of Enterprise, Alabama quoted a local narcotics investigator who believed it was being used in Coffee County, Alabama. A commentary in \"The Times-Reporter\" of Dover-New Philadelphia, Ohio said jenkem was \"largely debunked\", but that \"someone will be stupid enough to try it.\" The story was also covered with varying degrees of skepticism in \"The Orange County Register\", Evansville, Indiana Fox affiliate WTVW, and Wichita, Kansas CBS affiliate KWCH-TV.\n\nIn 2009, Bettendorf, Iowa amended its city ordinance regarding illegal inhalants to include organic substances. In 2010, an apartment building in Fort Pierce, Florida was condemned after police found leaking containers of human waste in a unit.

According to the police there were roughly 700 people in the hall at the time of the collapse. A further collapse occurred 90 minutes later during rescue operations. Polish government spokesman Krzysztof Mejer confirmed that there had been 65 dead as well as more than 170 injured, including 13 foreigners. There are confirmed deaths of ten foreign tourists – one from Belgium, one from Germany, three from Slovakia, one from the Netherlands, one from Hungary and three from the Czech Republic. The trade hall was hosting the 56th National Exhibition of Carrier Pigeons, with over 120 exhibitors from all over Europe. Poland was at that time experiencing very cold weather with heavy snow. This meant that the rescue operation was undertaken in sub-zero temperatures, putting the survivors inside the building at risk of exposure.\n\nRescue support was sent from the surrounding area, including Katowice, as well as from the neighbouring province of Lesser Poland. Since parts of the collapsed structure were supported only by heaps of snow, the rescue teams could not heat the pockets beneath the collapsed roof with hot air, fearing that the roof might collapse even further.\n\nThe search and rescue action was terminated on the afternoon of Sunday 29 January 2006 as, according to Janusz Skulich, commander of the Silesian Fire Fighters, the probability of rescuing any more survivors from beneath the collapsed roof was by then close to zero. Heavy equipment is reported to have started clearing the area of the remaining rubble.\n\nThe rescue action was carried out by 103 firefighter teams (more than 1000 fire fighters altogether), EMS units as well as 230 policemen with dogs, military police units from Kraków and Gliwice, the GOPR mountain rescue team of Szczyrk and specialists from the mine rescue team of Bytom. Survivors were taken to nearby hospitals in Chorzów and Katowice, and to other towns of the region, including Siemianowice Śląskie, Bytom, Sosnowiec, Ruda Śląska, Dąbrowa Górnicza and Piekary Śląskie. Andrzej Skrzyś, vice-president of Polish Society of Carrier-Pigeons said that by Saturday the rescue services had brought over 1,000 pigeons to the office of the society, that were being fed and watered by pigeon-fanciers from Chorzów until the arrival of their owners.\n\nOn 30 January 2006 there were 67 confirmed deaths and about 30 missing people. Later that day the number of victims was revised down to 62 confirmed deaths. On 31 January three more bodies were found in the ruins of MTK, raising the death toll to 65. Next day, officials stated that due to irregularities by funeral houses and dissection rooms, the wrong number of victims had been reported, and on 1 February there were 63 confirmed deaths. On 11 and 14 February the bodies of the 64th and 65th victims of roof collapse were found.\n\nIn the morning of 19 February workers got to the last area of the hall that was still covered by fragments of the hall’s collapsed roof. They found no more victims but found two pigeons that were still alive after spending 22 days trapped under the rubble.\n\nAfter the tragedy, senior authorities arrived at the scene, including the Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz and the President of Poland Lech Kaczyński. The latter declared the period until 1 February to be national days of mourning.\n\nOn Tuesday, 21 February, at 0600 hours Central European Time (0500 UTC) three people were arrested and brought to the Katowice District Prosecutor’s Office: New Zealand–born chairman of the International Katowice Fair Board of Management Bruce Robinson (who was also a Managing Director of the London–based Expomedia company that owned a 51% share in MTK), deputy chairman Ryszard Ziółek, and the company’s technical manager Adam Hildebrandt. They were interviewed and charged with criminal negligence – allegedly they were aware of the fact that the building was unsafe and yet allowed the Fair to go on, and by doing so they contributed to deaths of 65 people. The spokesperson for the Prosecutor’s Office did not rule out laying other charges in the future – depending on facts established by experts on causes of the building’s collapse. A search warrant was also executed at Mr. Robinson’s Warsaw apartment. The charges carried a maximum of 8 years imprisonment. Prosecutors also applied to the court for the accused to be detained for 3 months. The application was granted by the court, their application for bail was refused. A judge is quoted as saying that immediately after the catastrophe the accused destroyed some vital documents and there exists a possibility that if they were released on bail they would intimidate witnesses to change their testimonies. Their appeal against arrest was rejected by the District Court on 5 May.\n\nAfter interviewing some 200 witnesses, the analysis of company documents, experts’ findings and data from the company’s computers (some of which was recovered by computer specialists) the prosecutors allege that the accused were responsible for failing to remove heavy snow and ice from the building’s roof, and also that in the past, the roof had gotten damaged and yet they carried out only emergency repairs and did not report the damage to a building inspector as required by Polish law. Earlier the managers claimed both that the snow was removed from the roof and that it was impossible for them to clear the roof because a Tax Office seized their accounts due to tax arrears. A spokesperson for the Tax Office refuted this claim saying that only some of the company’s cash was seized and amounts remaining should have been more than sufficient to pay for snow and ice removal.\n\nOn 31 March 2006 the commission investigating causes of the disaster released a preliminary report into their findings. They found numerous design and construction flaws that contributed to the speed of the collapse. The snow from the roof was not being removed which resulted in construction overload by more than 100%. Moreover, in 2002 the construction buckled under the heavy snow; contrary to the regulations the hall was repaired without getting a building inspector’s clearance and without doing necessary tests and calculations to determine if the construction was stable and had sufficient strength.\n\nOn Monday, 26 June 2006, three architects who designed the hall were arrested. Two were charged with \"wilfully causing a building catastrophe\" and by this causing the death of 65 people, the third one was charged with \"involuntarily causing a building catastrophe.\" The prosecutor alleges that Jacek J. and Szczepan K. made several errors and introduced several amendments to the project that were not agreed upon. Both were aware of the fact that in January 2000 the roof buckled under the weight of the snow, yet they did not take any steps to remedy the situation and perhaps prevent the tragedy. The third architect, Andrzej W., is charged with approving the project despite its errors and deficiencies. The charges are the result of reports made by experts on building, steel constructions and reinforced concrete constructions. Pursuant to Polish law that automatically grants the accused name suppression, the surnames of the accused are unavailable in the Polish media.\n\nOn 14 February 2007 the Court of Appeal in Katowice granted bail to the three top bosses of the company – Bruce Robinson, Ryszard Ziółek, and Adam Hildebrandt. Mr. Robinson had to pay a 100,000 zloty bond (approx. €25,000/$33,000/£17,000), and the other two – 50,000 zloty each. All three also had to remain under police supervision and had to surrender their passports. The prosecutor appealed against granting of bail while one of the accused appealed against the amount. On Monday, the 5 March 2007, the Court of Appeal in Katowice rejected both appeals and at the same time raised the amount that Bruce Robinson has to deposit to 300,000 zloty (about €75,000/$100,000/£50,000). The ruling was final.\n\nAs a result of the catastrophe, in March 2007 Polish building law was amended. Large buildings must now undergo a technical survey twice every year (before and after winter) to make sure they are safe and structurally sound. Failure to conduct the survey is punishable by a minimum 1,000 zloty fine or a term in prison.\n\nThe investigation was formally completed at the end of June 2008. The public prosecutor of the Katowice District Public Prosecutor’s Office decided to indict 12 people. These include the designers of the hall, Jacek J. and Szczepan K., who on conviction for “directly endangering lives of other people” faced up to 12 years of prison, two members of the board, Bruce Robinson and Ryszard Ziółek, and 7 other people, who if convicted for gross negligence would face up to 8 years in jail, and the Chorzów County building inspector who faced lesser charges. The indictment was filed with the court on 18 July.\n\nThe experts determined that the main reason for the catastrophe was incorrect design. It was changed in order to make the construction cheaper. Emails recovered from seized computers proved that members of the Board of Directors were fully aware of the problems and of an expert’s recommendation that snow be removed from the roof and that the design was verified. One of the indicted, technical coordinator Piotr I., was charged with failing to order the evacuation doors to be opened; he is the only one that pleaded guilty. In the course of the investigation it was found that none of the victims died because of locked evacuation doors.\n\nPost-mortems carried out on victims have shown that none of them died of exposure; all died because of injuries sustained because of the collapse of the roof.\n\nThere has been some confusion over whether MTK is located in Katowice or Chorzów. The registered and street addresses of the company are in Katowice, and the entrance to the grounds is from a street that belongs administratively to Katowice. However, the company’s grounds—and thus the site of the catastrophe—lie within Chorzów’s administrative boundaries. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24456318", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24456318", "title": "Leyenda de Plata", "text": "Leyenda de Plata\n\nThe Leyenda de Plata (Spanish for \"the Silver Legend\") is an annual lucha libre tournament held by the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) since 1998. The tournament honors El Santo, \"Enmáscarado de Plata\" (the Silver mask) and has been held every year since 1998 except for 2003 when El Hijo del Santo (El Santo's son) did not work for CMLL. CMLL still holds the annual tournament despite El Hijo del Santo no longer works for CMLL. It is the most prestigious of all of CMLL's annual tournaments. The original format of the tournament was the \"Torneo cibernetico\" to qualify for a semi-final. The winner of the semi-final faces the winner of the previous year's tournament in the final. Since 2005 CMLL has held two cibernetico matches and the winner of each then meet in the semi-final. In 2011, the tournament was modified to eliminate the final stage. The winner is given a plaque with a solid silver \"El Santo\" mask on it. Only two wrestlers have won \"Leyend de Plata\" more than once, Místico won it in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and Negro Casas in 2000, 2014 and 2015. After a two-year hiatus, the tournament returned in 2011.\n\nThe first ever \"Leyenda de Plata\" tournament was held in 1998 from July 24 to July 31 in \"Arena Mexico\", Mexico City, Mexico. The tournament was held to commemorate the 15 year anniversary of El Santo's death in 1983. Unlike later tournaments there was no final, instead El Santo's son, El Hijo del Santo, faced the winner of the \"Cibernetico\" to determine the first winner. Scorpio Jr. won the \"cibernetico\", outlasting Atlantis, Shocker, Olímpico, Pantera, El Felino, Negro Casas, Tony Rivera, La Fiera, Dr. Wagner Jr., Blue Panther, Satánico, Karloff Lagarde Jr., Black Warrior, Último Guerrero and Violencia. Scorpio Jr. defeated El Hijo del Santo by count-out to win the \"Leyenda de Plata.\n\nThe qualifying \"Cibernetico\" took place on November 26, 1999 and saw El Hijo del Santo outlast a field of 15 other wrestlers including Antifaz del Norte, Bestia Salvaje, BlacK warrior, Blue Panther, Emilio Charles Jr., El Felino, Fuerza Guerrera, Negro Casas, Olímpico, Rey Bucanero, Satánico, Tarzan Boy, Tony Rivera, Último Guerrero and Zumbido. El Hijo del Santo only eliminated one wrestler in the match, Último Guerrero to qualify for the final. Like in 1998 the 1999 \"Leyenda de Plata\" cibernetico winner went straight to the final, a rematch from the 1998 tournament, only this time El Hijo del Santo defeated Scorpio Jr. to win the tournament named after his father.\n\nThe third annual \"Leyenda de Plata\" started on September 22, 2000, with a 16-man \"tornero cibernetico\". Unlike in 1998 and 1999, CMLL added a semi-final match to the tournament as the last two wrestlers in the \"cibernetico\" would meet in a singles match the following week. The semi-finalsts were Dr. Wagner Jr. and Negro Casas, outlasting Antifaz del Norte, Atlantis, Astro Rey Jr., Black Warrior, Blue Panther, El Felino, Fuerza Guerrera, Olímpico, Rey Bucanero, Safari, Satánico, Scorpio Jr., Tarzan Boy and Zumbido. The two survivors faced off in a singles match the following week, which Negro Casas won. On October 6, 2000, Negro Casas defeated El Hijo del Santo to win the 2000 \"Leyenda de Plata\".\n\nThe 2001 \"Leyenda de Plata\" was the fourth annual tournament and the first tournament to feature a Battle Royal to determine the two teams for the cibernetico. The first eight men eliminated from the battle royal would be one team and the remaining eight wrestlers would form the other team in the cibernetico match that followed immediately after the battle royal. Team \"A\" consisted of Averno, Black Warrior, Black Tiger, Fuerza Guerrera, Juventud Guerrera, Dr. Wagner Jr., Mephisto and Másacara Mágica. Team \"B\" consisted of Antifaz, Atlantis, Blue Demon Jr., El Hijo del Santo, El Felino, Ricky Marvin, Safari and Virus. The last two survivors were Black Warrior and Black Tiger III, both from Team \"A\". On October 12, 2001, Black Warrior and BlacK Tiger III faced off in a singles match that Black Warrior won. The storyline of the match was Black Tiger III turning \"Rudo\" (heel or \"bad guy\") while Black Warrior was turning \"Tecnico\" (face or \"good guy\") during the course of the match. The following week Black Warrior's momentum helped him gain the victory over Negro Casas to win the 2001 \"Leyenda de Plata\".\n\nThe \"cibernetico\" qualifier for the 2002 \"Leyenda de Plata\" took place on July 26, 2002 and once again saw two teams of eight face off to determine the semi-finalists. Team \"A\" consisted of Atlantis, Averno, Blue Panther, El Felino, Mephisto, Safari, Satánico and Virus. Team \"B\" was Black Tiger, Fuerza Guerrera, Hombre Sin Nombre, Negro Casas, Olímpico, Tony Rivera, Violencia and Volador Jr.. The two semi-finalsts were El Felino and Black Tiger III, making Black Tiger the first wrestler to qualify for the semi-final more than once. On August 2, 2002 El Felino defeated Black Tiger in the semi-final and a week later he defeated Black Warrior to win the tournament.\n\nAfter not holding a \"Leyenda de Plata\" tournament in 2003, it returned in 2004 with the qualifying \"cibernetico\" being held on July 16, 2004. the teams were: \"A\", Alan Stone, Atlantis, Averno, Mephisto, Misterioso Jr., Satánico, Tarzan Boy and Virus. Team \"B\", Black Warrior, Perro Aguayo Jr., Emilio Charles Jr., Másacara Mágica, Místico, Negro Casas, Super Crazy and Volador Jr.. The main storyline of the \"cibernetico\" was the building rivalry between Negro Casas and the recently \"rudo\"-turned Perro Aguayo Jr. Aguayo cheated to eliminate Negro Casas and along with Atlantis were the last two surviving wrestlers. On July 23, 2004 Aguayo and Atlantis wrestled in a singles match, which unlike previous years was a \"best of three falls\" match, that actually went to four falls before Perro Aguayo Jr. won. A week later Perro Aguayo Jr. defeated El Felino, using the victory to further the storyline with Negro Casas, Felino's brother and corner-man for the night. Following his victory Perro Aguayo Jr. broke the plaque with El Santo's mask on it, claiming that the Aguayo's were the greatest family in wrestling, refusing to accept a trophy with El Santo's name on it.\n\nThe 2005 \"Leyenda de Plata\" is the only tournament to not feature the previous year's champion defending the trophy, playing off Aguayo's breaking of the trophy the previous year. The lack of defending champion forced CMLL to change the format of the \"Leyenda de Plata\" as they held two eight-man \"ciberneticos\" instead of one 16-man, with the winner of each cibernetico facing each other the following week. The two \"cibernetico\" format has been the standard tournament format for the \"Leyenda de Plata\" ever since 2005. The first cibernetico took place on October 28, 2005 and featured El Hijo del Santo, Hombre Sin Nombre, La Máscara, Volador Jr., Misterioso Jr., Jado, Averno and Negro Casas. The match came down to Hijo del Santo and Casas and initially ended in a double pin. After the match was restarted El Hijo del Santo won by submission. The second \"cibernetico\" took place on November 4 and saw Atlantis outlast a field that also included Místico, Último Dragón, Máxmio, El Sagrado, Mephisto, Hijo de Pierroth and Gedo. On November 11, 2005, Atlantis defeated El Hijo del Santo with help from his corner-man Último Guerrero to win the seventh \"Leyenda de Plata\".\n\n\nThe 2006 \"Leyenda de Plata\" started on August 25, 2006 with the first of two eight-man \"cibernetico\" qualifying matches. The \"cibernetico\" saw Black Warrior eliminate Rey Bucanero as the last man in a match that also included Heavy Metal, Metro II, La Máscara, Último Guerrero, Mephisto and Misterioso Jr.. With Black Warrior winning the first \"cibernetico\" it was not too surprising that Místico won the second \"cibernetico\" as the two had been involved with a long-running storyline feud throughout 2006. Místico outlasted Mr. Águila, Negro Casas, El Sagrado, Volador Jr., Averno and Alex Koslov. The semi-final on September 8, 2006, saw Místico defeat Black Warrior, followed by a \"mask vs. mask\", \"Luchas de Apuesta\" challenge from Black Warrior that Místico accepted for the CMLL 73rd Anniversary Show. On September 15, 2006 Místico defeated Atlantis to win the \"Leyeda de Plata\", overcoming interference from Atlantis' corner-man Black Warrior. After the match Black Warrior stole the \"Leyenda de Plata\" trophy and ran off with it, furthering their feud.\n\n\nThe ninth \"Leyenda de Plata\" was held between May 18 and June 8, 2007. This was the first year that \"Leyenda de Plata\" was held without El Hijo del Santo working for CMLL, CMLL claimed that they owned the rights to promote the \"Leyenda de Plata\" and has promoted it without Hijo del Santo working for CMLL since then. The first \"Cibernetico\" took place on May 18, Perro Aguayo Jr. was originally scheduled to be part of the match, hinting at a very anticipated Aguayo vs. Místico match that had been building for a while. In the weeks leading up to the first \"cibernetico\" Perro Aguayo Jr. was injured and had to pull out of the match, he was replaced by fellow \"Los Perros del Mal\" member Mr. Águila, who'd go on to win the qualifier over Negro Casas, El Felino, Tarzan Boy, Mephisto, Máximo, Alex Koslov, Stuka Jr., Volador Jr. and Mictlán. On May 25, 2007 El Sagrado qualified for his first ever \"Leyenda\" semi-final as he outlasted Averno, Ephesto, virus, El Texano Jr., Leono, Loco Max, Valiente, Heavy Metal and BlacK Warrior. On June 1, 2007 Mr. Águila defeated El Sagrado to earn a spot in the final. On June 8, 2007 Místico became the first wrestler to not only win the tournament twice but also in back to back years as he defeated Mr. Águila. Following his victory Perro Aguayo Jr. attacked Místico furthering the storyline between the top \"tecnico\" and top \"rudo\" of the promotion.\n\n\nThe tenth \"Leyenda de Plata\" took place from July 4 til July 25, 2008. After being forced to withdraw from the 2007 tournament due to an injury Perro Aguayo Jr. won the first \"cibernetico\" qualifier by outlasting Hajime Ohara, Stuka Jr., El Felino, Ephesto, Averno, La Máscara, Mephisto and Volador Jr.. The following week Dr. Wagner Jr. also qualified for the semi-final by defeating Loco Max, El Sagrado, Máscara Purpura, Virus, Sangre Azteca, El Hijo del Fantasma, La Sombra, Black Warrior and Heavy Metal. Perro Aguayo Jr. overcame Dr. Wagner Jr. with the help of \"Los Perros del Mal\" and the 2008 \"Leyenda de Plata\" saw the final that was originally planned for the 2007 tournament as Místico faced off against Perro Aguayo Jr. As in the semi-final \"Los Perros del Mal\" tried to interfere in the main event but was stopped by Místico's friends Héctor Garza and Dos Caras Jr., enabling Místico win \"Leyenda de Plata\" for the third time.\n\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus, the eleventh \"Leyenda de Plata\" was announced on September 13, 2011, as taking place from September 23 to October 7, 2011. With the winner of the three previous \"Leyenda de Plata\"'s, Místico, having signed a contract with WWE in January 2011, CMLL eliminated the final stage of the tournament, meaning that the winners of the \"ciberneticos\" qualified straight for the finals. The first \"cibernetico\" took place on September 23 and was won by Volador Jr., who outlasted Delta, Guerrero Maya Jr., La Máscara, Metal Blanco, Palacio Negro, Pólvora, Puma King, Shigeo Okumura, Stuka Jr., Tiger and Valiente. The second \"cibernetico\" took place on September 30 at CMLL's 78th Anniversary Show and was won by Jushin Thunder Liger, who outlasted Diamante, Dragón Rojo Jr., Fuego, Hijo del Signo, Olímpico, Máscara Dorada, Mephisto, Metro, Rey Escorpión, Sangre Azteca and Virus. On October 7, Volador Jr. defeated Jushin Thunder Liger to win the 2011 \"Leyenda de Plata\".\n\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus the \"Leyenda de Plata\" tournament returned in late 2013 with two qualifying \"Torneo ciberneticos\" and a final match between each elimination match winner. The first match took place on December 20, 2013, as part of CMLL's \"Super Viernes\" show and was won by Titán. The second \"torneo\" was won by Negro Casas a week later. On January 3, Casas defeated Titán to win the tournament.\n\nOn May 8, 2015 Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) announced that the 2015 \"Leyenda de Plata\" tournament would begin the following Friday, May 15, as part of the Friday Night \"Super Viernes\" show. The participants of the first round were: Bárbaro Cavernario, Dragon Lee, Fuego, Kamaitachi, Luciferno, Mephisto, Místico, Niebla Roja, The Panther, Titán, Virus and Volador Jr. In the end Dragon Lee pinned Virus to win the \"torneo cibernetico\", which meant he would face the previous year's winner Negro Casas the following week. On May 22, Casas defeated Dragon Lee in the finals to win the tournament.\n\nThe 2016 \"Leyenda de Plata\" (Spanish for \"Silver Legend\") was anannual professional wrestling tournament held by the Mexican Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (\"World Wrestling Council\" in English; CMLL) that is slated to start on July 15, 2016. The \"Leyenda de Plata\" tournament honors \"lucha libre\" legend El Santo and has been held on an almost-annual schedule since 1998. The tournament consists of a \"torneo cibernetico\" elimination match as the first round and the winner of that match would face the previous' year's winner in the finals. For the 2016 tournament CMLL originally announced that the 2015 tournament winner, Negro Casas, was part of the initial field, but later replaced him with Dragon Lee to keep the original format intact.\n\nThe \"torneo cibernetic\" competitors included: Bárbaro Cavernario, Dragon Lee, Guerrero Maya Jr., La Máscara, Mephisto, Místico, the Panther, Ripper, Titán, Tritón, Virus and Volador Jr. During the final moments of the \"torneo cibernetico\" La Máscara applied the \"La Campana\" submission hold on Dragon Lee, when Lee's older brother Rush ran to the ring and attacked La Máscara to cause a disqualification. After the match, Dragon Lee challenged La Máscara to a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match, but La Máscara did not accept the match at the time. After the challenge, La Máscara attacked Dragon Lee and stole Dragon Lee's mask. The following week La Máscara defeated Negro Casas after interference from Casas' corner man Tiger hit Casas instead.\n\nThe 2017 Leyenda de Plata (Spanish for \"Silver Legend\") was a professional wrestling tournament produced by Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. The tournament will be in honor of Mexico's most famous wrestler El Santo. The tournament is scheduled to be a \"torneo cibernetico\" elimination match featuring Sansón, Puma, Mistico, Volador Jr., Guerrero Maya Jr., The Panther, Carístico, Forastero, Soberano Jr., Dragon Lee, Negro Casas, Tiger, Titán, Mephisto, Virus and Cavernario where the last two men in the ring face off in the finals\n\n"}
{"id": "5306476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5306476", "title": "List of close election results", "text": "List of close election results\n\nThis is a list of close election results at national and state level.\n\nIt lists results that have been decided by a margin of less than 1 vote in 1000 (a margin of victory of less than 0.1%). To provide context, after the first table is another table showing the distribution of winning margins in different areas. Depending on the area, from 1 in 40 to 1 in 500 election contests is decided by less than 1 vote in 1000. This list is limited to elections in which at least 1000 votes were cast.\n\nAccording to a 2001 study of state and federal elections in the United States between 1898 and 1992, \"one of every 100,000 votes cast in U.S. elections, and one of every 15,000 votes cast in state elections, \"mattered\" in the sense that they were cast for a candidate that officially tied or won by one vote.\"\n\nWhile not an election, a member of Congress once owed his seat to the drawing of lots. In 1902, after more than 7000 votes at three conventions, the Democrats were unable to decide among three candidates for nomination to Texas's 12th congressional district. Two candidates put their names in a hat, drew one out and the loser agreed to withdraw and support the winner. Oscar W. Gillespie won the game of lots, the nomination and the following general election, serving in Congress for 8 years.\n\nThere are a variety of ways in which tied elections are settled. Some are decided by drawing lots or other games of chances. Others lead to a runoff or special election. Still others are decided by some third party such as the legislature or a high-ranking elected official. In one case in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 1891, it was settled with a 200-yard footrace. In that case William Simms seemed to be cruising to an easy victory for County Treasurer when he tripped and fell 3 yards from the finish line allowing Frank Hollowell to win the race instead.\n\n! Year !! Country /Region\n! Election !! Race\n! Margin(%) !! Margin(votes) !! Total votes cast for winner\n! Description\n\n\"It has been repeated time and again that the annexation of Texas was carried in the United States Senate by one vote; that Edward A. Hannegan, then the United States Senator from Indiana was elected to the Senate by one vote, and that that one vote was given Hannegan by Daniel Kelso, then senator from Switzerland County, who was elected by one majority.\n\n\"This is an error, for Kelso, when he voted for Hannegan as United States Senator, represented Switzerland County by virtue of a majority of about 150 voters of the county, over Samuel Howard at the August election of 1842. In 1843 David Henry was elected over Kelso by one majority. Kelso contested the election, and the Senate declared that neither was elected, and sent them back to the people for decision, and at the August election, 1844, Henry was elected by a small but decided majority.\"\n\nArcher contested. Livingston precinct had initially certified Allen and Archer's votes as 47–100 (in that precinct). But they later certified that they had made a mistake and the vote (in that precinct) should instead have been 46–102. In which case the overall vote should have been 8451–8453.\n\nThe Committee of Elections concluded that Allen had won by at least 1 and probably 2 votes and recommended that he be seated. However, the House voted 94–90 that Allen would not be seated and also voted 91–89 that Archer would not be seated either. The seat was thus vacated.\n\nIn the 1856 special election or rematch between Allen and Archer, Allen soundly defeated Archer 13,081–10,136.\nMacaulay petitioned for a recount, whereupon the Rutland Superior Court determined that Maynard still beat Macaulay by two votes: 10,978–10,976.

The principal prize, to be awarded annually for an initial period of eight years, was a prize for long distance flight, and consisted of a bronze statue as a trophy (valued at 10,000 FF-French francs) and a money prize of 20,000 FF. The flying club of the winner also received a replica of the trophy if they did not already own one. Administration and determination of the exact conditions for each year were delegated to the Aéro-Club de France (AeCF). Attempts to win the prize could be made anywhere in the world where there was a flying club associated with the AeCF.\n\nAt the same time, Prix d'Aviation Michelin was a special prize of 100,000 francs offered for a flight by an aircraft carrying a passenger, taking off from either the department of Seine or Seine-et-Oise, flying over the Arc de Triomphe and the cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand, and landing on the summit of the Puy de Dôme inside six hours starting from the time at the Arc de Triomphe. This was won by Eugène Renaux on 7 March 1911, flying a Maurice Farman biplane.\n\nIn 1909, a second award, the British Empire Michelin Cup, was announced, for flights made by aviators who were citizens of the British Empire, flying aircraft of all-British manufacture. The original award therefore became known as the International Michelin Cup.\n\nWhen the prizes were first instituted, 25 French francs were worth one pound Sterling.\n\nWon by Wilbur Wright with a flight made on 31 December 1908 at Le Mans officially reckoned as . The course over which the flight was made was an isosceles triangle with two sides of 1 km and a third of 200 m, totalling 2.2 km. The flight had to be made before sunset and only complete circuits counted. Wright took off at 2 pm and completed 56 circuits before sunset. He then landed, flying a further 1.5 km to set a new world distance record of 124.7 km.\n\nFor the greatest distance exceeding 123.2 km. in a closed circuit made before the end of the year: 20,000 francs, and a bronze replica of the Michelin trophy.\n\nWon by Henry Farman with a flight of lasting 4h 6m 25s made on 3 November 1909 at Chalons.\n\nWon by Maurice Tabuteau flying a Maurice Farman biplane with a flight of , taking 7hr 48m 36.6s at Buc on 30 December 1910.\n\nIn 1911, the closing date for the competition was brought forward to 31 October.\n\nWon by E. Helen flying a Nieuport II monoplane on 8 September 1911, when he covered in 14 hr 7 min.\n\nFor the 1912 competition, the rules were considerably elaborated. The flight had to be made over a course made up of three different circuits, each starting from the same point. The first and third, each of about , had to have three or four compulsory landing-places, and the second, of , one or two landing places. Refuelling was only allowed at the starting point of each circuit. The circuits had to be covered in order, and if a competitor landed somewhere other than a nominated airfield, they had to start that circuit again. For every 75 kg of useful load carried apart from the pilot and necessary fuel, a bonus of 25% was allowed on the time, up to a maximum of 100 per cent. The extra load could be made up of passengers or ballast. Competing aircraft had to carry a sealed barograph, and an average speed of at least had to be maintained.\n\nThe 1912 prize was not won by any competitor, and the prize money was added to the prize for the following year.\n\nThe 1913 competition was very different. It was awarded for the greatest distance flown on a series of consecutive days, flying over a course, with a compulsory landing after each circuit.\n\nThe Cup was won by Emmanuel Helen flying a Nieuport monoplane, with a total distance of flown between 22 October and 29 November 1913.\n\nThe nature of the competition was changed again for the 1914 competition, the prize being awarded for the fastest time over a circuit of about .\nWon by Eugène Gilbert flying a Morane-Saulnier monoplane. Starting from Villacoublay at 03:04 on 8 June 1914, he flew via Peronne, Rheims, Saint-Dizier, Gray, Joigny, Beaune, Vienne and Nimes, landing at Mirande before reaching Pau, owing to running out of fuel. On the next day he flew via Pau, St. André de Cubzac, Romorantin, Angers, Evreux and Calais back to Villacoublay, landing at 18:37 p.m, having covered a distance of in 39h 35m.\n\nAfter the First World War, the competition was resumed in 1921. The competition was for the fastest time over a (3,000 km {1,860 mi) circuit: the French circuit was Versailles—Amiens—Mourmelon-le-Grand—Saint-Dizier—Dijon—Joigny—Beaune—Lyon—Nîmes—Pau—Bordeaux–Romorantin,—Angers—Évreux—Calais—Versailles, and the aircraft had to land at each of these airfields.\n\nThe result was the cause of considerable controversy. The best French time was achieved by Alphonse Poiré flying a Caudron C.60, who completed the circuit in 37h 23m. A faster time of 35h 45m over an Italian circuit was achieved by Capt Raffaele Martinetti-Bianchi, but he had not landed at the same aerodrome as he had departed from, since this had become waterlogged and he was not allowed to land there. The dispute between the Italian authorities, who had ratified his performance, and the Aéro-Club de France was taken to a specially appointed Fédération Aéronautique Internationale committee, which found in Martinetti's favour, but the AeCF disputed their judgement: eventually the prize was held to have been won by neither man, although in recognition of his performance the AeCF awarded the Gold Medal of the AeCF and a sum of money equal to the Michelin Prize to Poiré.\n\nA five-year extension, with annual prizes of 20,000 francs, was announced in 1922. The time period of the annual competition was altered to run from the beginning of July in one year to the end of the following June.\n\nWon by Capt Girier flying a Breguet 14, taking 20hr 41m 57sec, covering the course Lyons—Nimes—Pau—Bordeaux—Angers—St. Inglevert—Mourmelon—Metz—Strasbourg—Dijon—Avord—Lyons at an average speed (including time on the ground) of .\n\nThe 1924 French circuit was Versailles—Saint-Inglevert—Valenciennes—Mourmelon—Metz—Strasbourg—Dijon—Clermont-Ferrand—Lyon—Nimes—Toulouse—Pau—Bordeaux—Angers—Versailles\n\nWon by Lieut. Ludovic Arrachart flying a Breguet 19, completing the in 19h 22m 26s.\n\nWon by Pelletier d'Oisy flying a Blériot-SPAD S.61, completing the course in 15h 8m.\n\nAt the request of the military aviation authorities, the 1925-6 competition was limited to competitors flying the principal French bombing aircraft, the Breguet 19.\nThe best time was achieved by Capt. Coslin, with Lieut Gérard as observer, with a time of 18h 0m 24s, a speed of .\n\nHowever, since this time did not better the previous best, the cup did not change hands.\n\nThere were two competitions in 1926-7, one restricted to the Breguet 19. The course for both competitions was Paris (Le Bourget)—Nancy—Metz—Strasbourg—Dijon—Bourges—Clermont-Ferrand—Lyons—Istres—Pau—Casaux—Châteauroux—Tours—Romorantin—Chartres—Paris, a distance of .\n\nThe main competition was won by Capitain Challes flying a Blériot-SPAD S.61 in 12h 14m 37s.\n\nThe military competition was won by Capt Delaître and Sgt Cailloge, who covered the course in 14h 51m 55s, a speed of .\n\nAgain, the competition was restricted to the Breguet 19, with the added condition that an altitude of be reached at least once.\n\nWon by Capt. Delaître.\n\nIn 1928, the prize was offered for a further four years. The winning flight had to be made in France, although the competition was open to all nationalities, and the competition was restricted to single-seater aircraft with an engine of 230 hp or less. A minimum average speed of had to be maintained over the circuit, including time spent on the ground at the fifteen cities making up the circuit.\nWon by Michel Détroyat, flying a Morane-Saulnier MS.230.\n\nWon by Michel Détroyat, flying a Morane-Saulnier MS.130,\ncompleting the course Paris (Le Bourget)—Reims—Nancy—\nStrasbourg—Dijon—Clermont-Ferrand—Lyons—Montpellier— Perpignan—Toulouse—Pau—Bordeaux—Tours—Le Bourget at an average speed of .\n\nWon by Marcel Haegelen flying the Lorraine-Hanriot LH.41, with a time of 11h 37m 21s, an average speed of .\n\nWon by Marcel Haegelen flying the Lorraine-Hanriot LH 41, completing the course at an average speed of on 23 June 1932.\n\nWon by Michel Détroyat flying a Moraine Saulnier MS.234, completing the course at an average speed of .\n\nWon by Maurice Arnoux flying a Caudron C.430/1, completing the course in 10h 7m, a speed of .\n\nIn 1909, Michelin instituted a United Kingdom award, offering an annual award for five years of a trophy and £500. The competition was limited to British subjects flying aircraft of British construction. Administration of the competition was entrusted to the Aero Club of Great Britain.\nFor the first year, the flight was to be around a closed circuit made up of two or more markers, and a minimum distance of was specified. The closing date for the first competition was 31 March 1910.\n\nWon by J. T. C. Moore-Brabazon with a flight of at Eastchurch on 1 March 1910, flying the Short Biplane No. 2.\n\nThe rules for the 1910 competition, for which the closing date was 31 December 1910, were as before except that the minimum qualifying distance was raised to .\n\nWon by Samuel Cody flying the Cody Michelin Cup Biplane at Laffan's Plain, Farnborough with a flight of taking 4h 47m.\n\nAnnouncement of a second prize, to be competed for during the following three years, with a trophy and a cash prize of £400 for 1911, £600 for 1912 and £800 for 1913, for the fastest time over a cross-country circuit.\n\nOn 29 October 1911, the Michelin Cup No. 1 was again won by Samuel Cody, flying his Circuit of Britain biplane in 5 hr 15 min at Laffan's Plain, also setting a new British duration record.\n\nThe No. 2 cup was also won by Cody, with a flight made on 11 September 1911 of a circuit starting at Laffan's Plain, Farnborough—Andover—Hendon—Brooklands—Farnborough, taking 3 hr 6 min 30 sec to complete the course.\n\nThe rules were redefined for the 1912 competition: the No. 1 cup and cash prize of £5,000 was purely for endurance, all flying to be done between sunrise and sunset. The No. 2 cup and prize of £600 was for distance covered over a cross-country course of about of the competitor's choosing.\n\nThe No. 1 cup was won by Harry Hawker flying the Sopwith-Wright biplane, with a flight lasting 8 hours 23 minutes made on 24 October 1912 at Brooklands.\n\nThe No. 2 cup was won by Samuel Cody flying the Cody V, with a flight of 186 miles in 3hr 26m.\n\nMichelin Cup No. 1 for the longest distance flight round the course Brooklands–Hendon–Farnborough, with a minimum distance of 300 miles. Competitors had to make periodical stops of not less than five minutes, with engine stopped, on completing an entire circuit of the course plus one section: e.g., starting from Brooklands the competitor would pass Hendon, Farnborough, Brooklands, and alight at Hendon.\nThe prize had not been won by the closing date of 31 October 1913, so the closing date was extended to 14 November 1913.\n\nThe No. 1 Cup was won by Reginald H. Carr flying the Grahame White \"Charabanc\", with a flight of over .\n\nThe No. 2 cup, for the fastest time round a circuit of the competitor's choice of about 450 km, was not awarded. Although the prize was carried over to the next year, competition was terminated by the outbreak of World War I.\n"}

Sonic Youth made their first live appearances at this show. \nIn mid 1981 Kim Gordon and Josh Baer convinced Thurston Moore to organize this nine-day noise festival to accommodate underemployed experimental performers in the downtown scene. The festival was held in the White Columns gallery, which had a capacity of 60 people. Each night three to five acts performed, including Glenn Branca, Rhys Chatham, Jeffrey Lohn, Built on Guilt, Rudolph Grey, the Avant Squares, Off Beach, Mofungo, Red Decade, NNB, Robin Crutchfield's Dark Day, Ad Hoc Rock, Smoking Section, Chinese Puzzle, Avoidance Behaviour, and Sonic Youth.\n\nIn 1978 a similar series of punk rock influenced loud noise music mixed with performance art was held at New York’s Artists’ Space that led to the Brian Eno-produced recording \"No New York\". This recording was seen by many as the first attempt to define the no wave sound, as it documented The Contortions, Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Mars and DNA.\n\nMusic from the Noise Festival was first released as a cassette titled \"Noise Fest\" on ZG Music in 1981; the music label of the legendary ZG magazine organized by Rosetta Brookes.

In 1807, Picaud was engaged to marry a rich woman, but three jealous friends — Loupian, Solari, and Chaubart — falsely accused him of being a spy for England (a fourth friend, Allut, knew of their conspiracy, but did not report it). He was imprisoned in the Fenestrelle fortress for seven years, not even learning why until his second year there. During his imprisonment he ground a small passageway into a neighboring cell and befriended a wealthy Italian priest named Father Torri who was being held there. A year later, a dying Torri bequeathed to Picaud a treasure he had hidden in Milan. When Picaud was released after the fall of the Imperial government in 1814, he took possession of the treasure, returned under another name to Paris and spent 10 years plotting revenge against his former friends.\n\nPicaud first murdered Chaubart, or had him murdered. Picaud's former fiancée had, two years after his disappearance, married his former friend Loupian, who became the subject of his most brutal revenge. Picaud tricked Loupian's daughter into marrying a criminal, whom he then had arrested. Loupian's daughter promptly died of shock. Picaud then burned down Loupian's restaurant, or arranged to have it burned down, leaving Loupian impoverished. Next, he poisoned Solari to death and either manipulated Loupian's son into stealing some gold jewelry or framed him for committing the crime.

It is presumed that the killings occurred between October 1978 and the 1980s, but they may have continued until 1992. The victims, many of whom have never been identified, usually had reddish hair and their bodies were abandoned along major highways in the United States; presumably, they were hitchhiking or engaged in prostitution. Authorities are unsure of how many people were responsible for these murders, if they were all performed by the same perpetrator(s), or how many victims there were. It is believed that a total of six to eleven victims were involved. Of the presumed victims, four have been identified.\n\nThe body of a white female was found naked alongside Route 250 near Littleton, Wetzel County, West Virginia on February 13, 1983. A pair of senior citizens reported that they thought the remains were a mannequin before discovering it was a human corpse. The body had been placed at the area recently, as the snow was on the ground and absent on the body. Tire tracks and footprints indicate she died at a different area and was transported to the location where she was found. It is presumed that she had died two days before. She had not been an apparent victim of sexual assault, although foul play may have been involved in her death. This woman's cause of death was not officially determined, but she is a possible victim, as she may have been suffocated or strangled. This woman was one of the older victims, as her age range was between 35 and 45. The woman's hair was auburn, which matched the criteria for the killer. Her height was estimated to be approximately and weight as . Her eyes were presumed to be brown, although decomposition made it difficult to accurately determine eye color. She had two distinct scars, including one found on her abdomen from a Caesarean section, indicating she had at least one child and another found on one of the index fingers. The woman's legs and underarms were shaven, indicating an attention to grooming not characteristic of a transient or hitchhiker. A person of interest has emerged in this case, believed to be a middle-aged white male at the height of approximately and weighing . The man was seen near the area where the body was found and could have been involved with disposing of her body. The victim herself may have been seen alive in Wheeling, West Virginia as an employee or customer at a bar. She was subsequently buried after a funeral took place. West Virginia authorities are skeptical if this woman was a victim of this span of killings.\n\nThe body of 28-year-old Lisa Nichols, who also used the last name of Jarvis, was found on September 16, 1984 along Interstate 40 near West Memphis, Arkansas. She was a resident of West Virginia and authorities were not able to come into contact with family members for some time, indicating she was estranged from them, resulting in her remaining unidentified for nearly a year. Her body was not identified until June 1985, nine months after she was strangled and left wearing only a sweater. She was identified through fingerprints. Nichols is believed to be a part of the Redhead Murders, as she was found along a highway and had strawberry-blond hair at the time of her demise. Her remains were identified by a couple from Florida, who had allowed her to stay with them for a period of time. Nichols may have been murdered after leaving a truck stop along the highway and may have attempted to hitchhike.\n\nOn January 1, 1985, a bound body was found at the roadside near Jellico, Tennessee, in Campbell County on Interstate 75. Although her murder occurred about three days before, presumably on December 30, 1984, she was already in an advanced state of decomposition. Like the others, she was white and had short red hair, which was somewhat curly. She was likely between the ages of 17 and 25, although she may have been as old as 30 at the time she was murdered. The victim was found clothed, with a tan pullover, a shirt and jeans. The Jane Doe had green or hazel eyes, which could not be positively confirmed as a certain color because of the state of her body. The young woman also had freckles, various scars and burn marks on her body and was two and a half to five months pregnant when she was strangled. She had no evidence of dental work, except for a partial denture holding two false teeth on her upper jaw.\nIt is believed that she was between five feet one and when she died and was approximately .\n\nIt was announced on September 6, 2018, the victim had been identified as Tina Marie McKenney Farmer of Indiana. Fingerprinting was the method of identification. She was 21 at the time of her death and was last seen in Indianapolis accompanied by a trucker headed to Kentucky. Farmer had one daughter prior to disappearing in 1984. She was reported missing by her family, yet authorities in Indiana did not enter her into national databases, as there was no law in the state, like others, which required them to do so.\n\nThe second victim in Campbell County was found on April 3, 1985, but her hair color is unknown, which does not immediately indicate she was a victim of the Redhead Murderer. She was believed to have died between 1981 and 1984, one to four years before. Unlike the other victims, she was younger, between 9 and 15, when the others were estimated to be over 16. She was located by a passerby about 200 yards off Big Wheel Gap Road, four miles southwest of Jellico in Campbell County, some distance from Interstate 75, near a strip mine. The cause of this girl's death is unknown, as her remains were partial, but still may be homicide. Thirty-two bones, including her skull, were all that were recovered from the scene. Her skull allowed facial reconstruction. She wore a necklace and bracelet made of plastic buttons from clothing. There were a pair of boots recovered that were size 5, which may not belong to the victim, and a few scraps of clothing. Due to the condition of her body, her height, weight, eye color and hair color were not possible to estimate.\n\nRecent analysis of the victim's remains indicated she was not native to the area she was discovered. The tests showed she was likely born in Florida or central Texas, later relocating to the Midwest, Rocky Mountain states, the Southwest or the Pacific Coast.\n\nThe skeletonized body of a red-haired female was located on March 31, 1985 in Pleasant View, Cheatham County, Tennessee. She was believed to have died three to five months before, due to an unknown cause. However, her case is possibly linked to the redhead murders because her remains were found at the side of Interstate 24 between mile markers 29 and 30. Unlike some of the other victims, she wore clothing: a shirt, sweater, pants and underwear. She was white, between five feet and tall with an inestimable weight. By examining her teeth, the victim had some evidence of crowding and overlapping of her teeth. This woman was believed to be between the ages of thirty-one and forty at the time of her death.\n\nThe body of a woman who had died by suffocation was found in a white Admiral refrigerator in Gray, Knox County, Kentucky on April 1, 1985, alongside Route 25. The refrigerator had a decal of the words \"Super Woman\" on the front. The victim had been dead for a few days, and was nude except for two distinctive necklace pendants, one of a heart and the other of a gold-colored eagle, and two pairs of socks; one white, and the other white with green and yellow stripes. There were reports that the victim may have been soliciting a ride to North Carolina over CB radio. Five hundred people attended her funeral, which was also televised. The case was a local sensation in Gray, as the town was a \"quiet\" and \"sleepy\" place where little out of the ordinary usually happened. Distinguishing features of the body included a number of moles (on the right side of her neck, near one ankle, and below each breast), a yellow-stained upper incisor, and a scar and other marks on her abdomen, indicating that she had borne a child. Her eyes were light brown and her hair was red and nearly a foot long, which fit the pattern of the redhead killer. After her autopsy, she was determined to be between 24 and 35 years old and approximately 4 feet 9 to 4 feet 11 inches tall. It is also possible that she owned a pair of boots found near the refrigerator. Several missing persons have been eliminated as possible matches for the victim. After the case was publicized in January 2013, the police received some tips, but it is unknown if they became solid leads.\n\nOn October 1, 2018, it was announced she had been positively identified as Espy Regina Black Pilgrim of North Carolina.\n\nOn April 14, 1985, a young white female's body was located in Greeneville, Greene County, Tennessee. She had died by severe blunt-force trauma and possibly a stab wound three to six weeks before and was an advanced state of decomposition. However, her fingerprints were possible to obtain, as well as her DNA and dental information. She had been approximately six to eight weeks pregnant shortly before she died, but had miscarried recently. She was estimated to be 14 to 20 years old (possibly as old as 25) and was five feet four inches to tall at a weight of . She had a slight overbite and had some fillings in her teeth, showing that she had dental care in life. She had also painted her fingernails pink. Because she had light brown to blond hair with red highlights, it is possible that her case could be related to the Redhead murders. Authorities hoped in late April 1985 that they would identify her body through fingerprints but were unsuccessful. Six missing women were ruled out as possible identities of the victim.\n\nIn November 2018, the victim was identified as New Hampshire native Elizabeth Lamotte, who was 17 at the time of her death. Lamotte had disappeared on April 6, 1984. She was identified through a DNA match after a DNA profile was obtained from Lamotte's family by New Hampshire police in 2017. She had been staying at a group home in Manchester and never returned after gaining furlough. Lamotte's DNA was initially taken to compare against the adult victim of the Bear Brook murders, as an unidentified girlfriend of the suspect was known by the same first name.\n\nIt is believed that most of the victims remain unidentified due to being estranged or not close with existing family members or may not have been native to the states in which that they were found. In 1985, not long after the Greene County victim was found, the states of Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arkansas and Mississippi requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation for assistance with the cases. There were inconsistencies with some of the victims, as some were found with or without clothing and some had a sexual encounter before their murders. During the conference, it was stated that four victims found in Texas and a victim found in 1981 in Ohio, nicknamed \"Buckskin Girl” (later identified as Marcia King), were ruled out as possible victims in 1985.\n\nA possible suspect emerged in the mid-eighties when a 37-year-old trucker attacked and attempted to strangle a woman with reddish hair, but was later dismissed, although he had left her lying near a highway, presuming she was dead. Another suspect was a 32-year-old trucker in Pennsylvania who was questioned after kidnapping and raping a young woman in the state of Indiana before she managed to escape. This suspect was also dismissed, after being questioned by Tennessee police.\n\nIn 2018, students enrolled in a sociology class at Elizabethton High School studied the case with the aid of their instructor. The class coined the name \"Bible Belt Strangler.\" Furthermore, the information developed by the class was submitted to an FBI profiler. They described the subject as a white male born between 1936 and 1962 (aged between 23 and 49 in 1985) who was likely a commercial trucker frequenting Interstate 40. They estimated his height and weight to be 5'9 to 6'2\" and 180-270 pounds, respectively. His work was likely based in or near the city of Knoxville, Tennessee.\n\n\n"}

These started in November 1930 and ended in December 1932. They were conducted as per the recommendation of Jinnah to Viceroy Lord Irwin and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, and by the report submitted by the Simon Commission in May 1930. Demands for swaraj, or self-rule, in India had been growing increasingly strong. Mahatma Gandhi, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Srinivasa, Sir Muhammad Zafrulla Khan and Mirabehn are key participants from India. By the 1930s, many British politicians believed that India needed to move towards dominion status. However, there were significant disagreements between the Indian and the British political parties that the Conferences would not resolve. The key topic was about constitution and India which was mainly discussed in that conference.\n\nThe Round Table Conference officially inaugurated by His Majesty George V on November 12, 1930 in Royal Gallery House of Lords at London and chaired by the British Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald.\n\nThe three British political parties were represented by sixteen delegates. There were fifty-eight political leaders from British India and sixteen delegates from the princely states. In total 74 delegates from India attended the Conference. However, the Indian National Congress, along with Indian business leaders, kept away from the conference. Many of them were in jail for their participation in Civil Disobedience Movement.\n\n\nThe conference started with 6 plenary meetings where delegates put forward their issues 9 sub committees were formed to deal with several different matters including federal structure, provincial constitution, province of Sindh and NWFP, defense services and minorities e.t.c. These were followed by discussions on the reports of the sub-committees on Federal Structure, Provincial Constitution, Minorities, Burma, North West Frontier Province, Franchise, Defense services and Sindh. These were followed by 2 more plenary meetings and a final concluding session. It was difficult for progress to be made in the absence of the Indian National Congress but some advances were made.\n\nThe idea of an All-India Federation was moved to the centre of discussion by Tej Bahadur Sapru. All the groups attending the conference supported this concept. The princely states agreed to the proposed federation provided that their internal sovereignty was guaranteed. The Muslim League also supported the federation as it had always been opposed to a strong Centre. The British agreed that representative government should be introduced on provincial level.\n\nOther important discussions were the responsibility of the executive to the legislature and a separate electorate for the Untouchables as demanded by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.\n\nThe Congress had boycotted the first conference was requested to come to a settlement by Sapru, M. R. Jayakar and V. S. Srinivasa Sastri. A settlement between Mahatma Gandhi and Viceroy Lord Irwin known as the Gandhi–Irwin Pact was reached and Gandhi was appointed as the sole representative of the Congress to the second Round Table Conference. Although MacDonald was still Prime Minister of Britain, he was by this time heading a coalition Government (the \"National Government\") with a Conservative majority. It was held in London in September 1931. The discussion led to the passing of the Government Of India act of 1935.\n\n\nThe second session opened on September 7, 1931. There were three major differences between the first and second Round Table Conferences. By the second:\n\n\nDuring the Conference, Gandhi could not reach agreement with the Muslims on Muslim representation and safeguards. At the end of the conference Ramsay MacDonald undertook to produce a Communal Award for minority representation, with the provision that any free agreement between the parties could be substituted for his award.\n\nGandhi took particular exception to the treatment of untouchables as a minority separate from the rest of the Hindu community. He clashed with the leader of depressed classes, Dr.B. R. Ambedkar, over this issue: the two eventually resolved the situation with the Poona Pact of 1932.\n\nThe third and last session assembled on November 17, 1932. Only forty-six delegates attended since most of the main political figures of India were not present. The Labour Party from Britain and the Indian National Congress refused to attend.\n\nFrom September 1931 until March 1933, under the supervision of the Secretary of State for India, Sir Samuel Hoare, the proposed reforms took the form reflected in the Government of India Act 1935.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1973853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1973853", "title": "Sieges of Galway", "text": "Sieges of Galway\n\nThe city of Galway, Ireland - built as a naval base and military fort by Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair in 1124, refounded as a military outpost and town by Richard Mor de Burgh in 1230 - has been subjected to a number of battles, sacks and sieges. This article enumerates them.\n\nDun Beal Gallimhe can be translated as \"fort at the mouth of the Gallimhe river.\" It is believed to have been situated on the site of the present Customs House. This building is situated in the heart of the old medieval city between Quay Street to the north, Flood Street to the south, Druid Lane to the east and Quay Lane to the west. Subsequent to the founding of Galway in 1232, a castle and hall were built upon the site. The latter building was known as the Red Earl's hall and was excavated in 1999.\n\nThere is some slight evidence for Viking use of the area, at least as a seasonal camp, as the Danes of Limerick made a number of devastating raids in the area in the 9th and 10th centuries, and though the annalistic evidence is ambiguous, seem to have made some sort of semi-permanent camp along the river or in Lough Corrib. Be that as it may, the earliest known building was erected there in 1124 at the instigation of High King Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair.\n\nBoth as a naval base and military base Dun Beal Gallimhe offered several advantages. It was surrounded to the north by a number of small islands that, separated from the Dun by large streams and extremely boggy ground, made physical progress difficult and an attack futile. To the south it was bounded by muddy estuary flats and the effects of the tide which made approach from this side just as difficult. The Dun itself was raised at the very end of a thin peninsula of land that could withstand attack by a relatively small number of defenders. Due west was the river, which is one of the fastest-flowing in Europe, and yet almost the only ford on the river. If all was lost, defenders could withdraw to the west bank and flee into Iar Connacht. If, however, the attacking force could still not make the east bank, there were only two other routes to the other side, neither favourable: one was to risk a crossing of Lough Corrib, which however can be treacherous at the best of times to an unskilled sailor; second, the unenviable sixty mile slog north to Cong.\n\nFrom a naval point of view Gallimhe did not make an especially desirable port, lacking a deep harbour. Up to the early 19th century smaller ships docked at the river quay, while larger ones remained at anchor out in the bay for unloading. Yet in the early days of its existence it offered a way into Lough Corrib and its surrounding landmass, from which an invader could strike deep into the heart of Delbhna Tir Dha Locha or Maigh Seola. Conversely it also offered a route out of the latter kingdom and a means to attack its ruler's enemies. Indeed, it was used in this capacity both in the 1160s and 1590s.\n\nAt least some of these factors played a part in subsequent sieges of the settlement. Only much later in its history it would be put to use as the premier merchant port and market of Ireland's west coast. By then it had far outgrown its initial \"raison d'être\" as seen by O Conchobair and de Burgh and become \"the City of the Tribes\" (see Tribes of Galway).\n\nNaval-based warfare became something of a regular occurrence in early 12th century Ireland. The Annals of Inisfallen note raids of this nature occurring in 1100, 1101, 1119, and 1124. Perhaps this was what led to Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair to build Dún Béal Gallimhe in 1124. It was located in Clan Fergal, the territory of the O Hallorans but was supervised by Ua Conchobair's vassals, the Ua Flaithbheartaigh, who at this time were still based in their homeland of Maigh Seola.\n\nDuring the summer of 1132, Conchobhair O Brian of Thomond (modern north Munster) invaded Hy-Many where he \"plundered ... Maenmhagh ... [and] carried off many cows.\" This raid was purely of a plundering nature, yet apparently within a very short period of time, he followed it up with a full-scale assault on O Conchobair's new naval base at Dún Béal Gallimhe. The Annals of the Four Masters noted that \"The castle of Bun-Gaillmhe was burned and demolished [by] a fleet of the men of Munster.\" The Munstermen then followed this up with a devastating raid on both Clan Fergal and Magh Seola, for the same annals note that \"A great slaughter was made of the Connachtmen by the men of Munster, wherein Conchobhar Ua Flaithbheartaigh, lord of West Connacht\" was slain.\n\nAlso among the dead were \"the two sons of Cathal Ua Mughroin\" and \"Ua Taidhg \"an Teaghlaigh\". This is significant because the Ua Mughroin were a sept native to Hy-Many, some distance from Gallimhe which was in any case historically based in a different territory, Clann Fergal. Therefore, they must have travelled some distance to be present to fight against the forces from Munster, possibly in a levy raised by Tairrdelbach himself. Ua Taidgh's nickname, An Teaghlaigh, indicates that he was of the household, or indeed the household bodyguard, of Tairrdelbach, who would of necessity have only accompanied the High King. Therefore, the deaths of members of these three vassal clans, as well as his own possible presence at the battle, indicates the importance the High King attached to his \"dún\"\" on the Gallimhe. This is underlined by the fact that it was rebuilt, which can be inferred by a further attack in 1149.\n\nThe 1149 siege of Dún Béal Gallimhe was led by Toirdhealbhach O Brían, then King of Thomond. It was a combined raid of plunder (taking the rich pickings of Maigh Seola) and military strategy (destroying the Dún).\n\nIn the years immediately prior to 1149, the respective interests of Connacht - still ruled by High King Tairrdelbach mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair - and of Thomond had were confined to putting down rebellions and civil strife in their kingdoms, as well as maintaining their areas of interest. Ruaidri was frequently at odds with the O Neills in Ulster and Meath, and had a sometime antagonistic relationship with Tighernan O Rúairc, King of Brefine, which was a buffer state carved out of disputed territory between Connacht and Ulster.\n\nToirdhealbhach O Brían on the other hand was pre-occupied with extending his influence into Leinster (the kingdom whose rejection of tributes had led to his ancestor, Brian Boru's, death in 1014), as well as with putting down rebellion in his native Thomond and with ensuring his vassals of Munster, the MacCarthys, knew their place. Both Kings had in fact ratified a treaty at Terryglass Monastery in 1144, possibly to recognise and respect their spheres of influence.\n\nHowever the following year Toirdhealbhach was decisively defeated by O Conchobair and his vassals at Feara Ceall in the Sliabh Bloom; O Brian had been en route to Meath to fight O Ruairc but had been intercepted by O Conchobair. O Brian was forced to return home, \"without prey, without hostage, without peace, without truce.\" This brought O Brian and O Conchobhair into open war; O Brian struck within the same year with \"an army into Connacht; and they carried off Ua Ceallaigh, i.e. Tadhg, son of Conchobhar, lord of Ui-Maine, and slew Ruaidhri Ua Flaithbheartaigh\". The death of Ua Flaithbheartaigh indicates that an attempt may have been made on Gallimhe, but O Brian would have to wait a full four years before he reached this objective.\n\nAccording to the Four Masters, in 1149 \"An army was led by Toirdhealbhach Ua Briain and the men of Munster into Connacht, until they arrived at Magh Ua mBriuin; they carried off a great spoil of cattle, and demolished Dún-Gaillmhe; and Ua Lochlainn, lord of Corca-Modhruadh, was drowned in the (river) Gaillimh.\" Again, the mention of Magh Ua mBriuin - an alternative name for Maigh Seola - demonstrates the destruction of Gallimhe and its fleet was merely one tactic employed by O Brian. Kinsmen and vassals would only stay loyal as long as a king could deliver the goods to ensure their loyalty, hence the rich plains were plundered of their goods, food and fine cattle. It also had the additional prize of weakening O Conchobair's prime vassal in the area, Ua Flaithbheartaigh.\n\nUa Lochlainn was of the Corcu Mo Druad, vassals of O Brian, and strategically located across Galway Bay. Thus it is possible that while O Brian led his army by land, Ua Lochlainn sailed across the bay and the two inflicted a sea-and-land siege of Gallimhe; this possibility is obliquely hinted at in the manner of Ua Lochlainn's death. It may even be that, contending for the lordship of Galway Bay - from which plundering raids could be made into Clan Fergal, Maigh Seola, Meadraige and Uí Fiachrach Aidhne - O Brian may have been letting Ua Lochlainn unleash himself against a prime adversary.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, in 1151, O Brian was deposed as King of Munster by his son, Muircheartach. Muircheartach was subsequently captured \"by treachery\" by \"Tadhg son of Diarmaid O Brian and Diarmaid Súgach O Conchobhair\" and delivered to his father. However, Tadhg mac Diarmaid O Brian rose against O Brian in rebellion, with the result that \"Toirdhealbhach son of Ruaidhrí O Conchobhair came with him to defend the kingship of Munster for him.\"!\n\nCathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair had owed his position as King of Connacht to King John, and the support of the latter's vassals in Ireland. In addition, he was able to obtain recognition of his son, Aedh mac Cathal Crobdearg Ua Conchobair as his heir.\n\nIn the year after Cathal's death in 1224, Aedh had to face a rebellion by Donn Oge Mageraghty of Sil Muirdeag, Aedh Ua Flaithbertaigh of Maigh Seola and an invasion by O Neill of Tir Eoghain from Ulster. O Neill and Aedh's rebellious vassals then crowned Turlough mac Ruaidri O Conchobair King of Connacht in opposition to Aedh, who was supported by only a few vassals such as MacDermott of Moylourg and O Flynn of the Cuirc remaining loyal. With the help of his Norman allies, Aedh was eventually able to suppress the rebellion, though \"there was not a church or territory in Connacht at that time that had not been plundered and desolated.\" The war was made worse by \"An oppressive malady raged in the province of Connacht at this time: it was a heavy burning sickness, which left the large towns desolate, without a single survivor.\"\n\nOne incident during the war had given Aedh cause for concern: his erstwhile allies, the Normans of Leinster and Munster, had invaded south Connacht \"and slew all the people that they caught, and burned their dwellings and villages.\" Aedh was furious at this because it was not by his command, and because the Normans \"were themselves excited by envy and rapacity, as soon as they had heard what good things the Lord Justice and his English followers had obtained in Connacht at that time.\" It was a sign of things to come.\n\nAedh mac Cathal was murdered by the Normans in 1228 and Aedh mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair was chosen by the Normans and the chiefs of Connacht to take his place. Yet in 1230 Aedh and his vassals turned on the Normans, vowing \"they would never own a lord who should bring them to make submission to the Galls. They made then great raids on the Galls, Aed son of Ruaidri and the men of West Connacht plundering the young son of William and Adam Duff, while Donn Oc and the sons of Magnus with the new levies of Sil Murray plundered Mac Gosdelb and Tir Maine as far as Athlone.\" It was in response to this that Richard Mor de Burgh led an army into Connacht \"\"and desolated a large portion of that country.\" De Burgh brought with him Felim mac Cathal Crobderg Ua Conchobair whom he intended to make king in place of Aedh. They crossed the Shannon at Athlone and made straight for Gallimhe.\n\nThe Dún at Gallimhe was being held and defended by Aedh Ua Flaithbertaig, who still held for Aedh mac Ruaidri (Ua Flaithbertaigh had been exiled into Iar Connacht by Aedh mac Cathal for his rebellion) . Apparently de Burgh was just reaching the Dún (and a highly apprehensive Ua Flaithbertaigh) \"\"when Aed mac Ruaidri came to his help with the Connachtmen, including the sons of Muirchertach O Conchobair.\" At some point in the fighting Aedh seems to have lost, or ceded possession of, the Dún, because the Annals of Connacht states that \"They were on the western bank of the Galway River and the Galls on the eastern.\" However, this does not seem to have been a decisive factor for de Burgh; as much as a week passed with \"much fighting ... between them every day, and in this condition the Galls remained, obtaining neither pledge nor hostage nor submissions from the Connachtmen.\" Dissatisfied with the inconclusiveness of the conflict, de Burgh cut his losses and left in the direction of Cong \"to pursue the cattle and folk which had fled into the mountains and recesses of the countryside and the sea-islands.\"\n\nBut as subsequent events would show, the strategic position of Dún Béal Gallimhe had made an impression upon de Burgh, and he would be back.\n\nIn 1232 de Burgh returned in force and took Fedhlim O'Conor prisoner, replacing him by Hugh O'Conor. Having taken control of the castle de Burgh made a number of substantial additions to the building. \n\nWhen Hugh O'Conor died in 1233 Fedhlim O'Conor regained his freedom and retook the town and castle. He demolished the castle works of de Burgh. \n\nRichard de Burgh recovered the town again and made it into the capital of the province, dying there in 1271.\n\nDuring the Nine Years' War Hugh Ruadh O'Donnell, in league with other chieftains, attacked the county of Galway in 1596 and, after burning Athenry, marched to the town of Galway. There they asked for provisions but were refused, retaliating by setting fire to outlying houses on the edge of the town. O'Donnell's forces were then driven off by cannon fire and an armed sally by the defenders and retreated to Mayo.\n\nOn the morning of 7 August 1642, to the \"considerable agitation and suspense [of the] town\", a naval squadron of seventeen ships appeared in Galway Bay. Led by Alexander, 11th Lord Forbes (died 1671), they had come to relieve the garrison of Forthill at the request of the English Parliament, and which had authorised him, as Lieutenant-General, to waste the coasts of Ireland. Launching long boats from the ship, Forthill was resupplied with food, arms and ammunition. Forbes then sent a messenger with a letter for Mayor Walter Lynch fitz James, ordering them to \"confess themselves to have been rebels, and humbly submitting to beg his majesty's intercession for them to the parliament of England, and to declare they would admit such governors as the king and state should appoint, and until then put themselves under the protection of Lord Forbes.\"\n\nMayor Lynch and the town council utterly refused the terms, to the surprise and anger of Lord Forbes. They instead made representations to the Earl of Clanricarde - who was at the time a neutral - for protection. Clanricarde in turn communicated to Forbes that, should he make war against the town, it would be both a breach of the peace and endanger the country by bringing yet another area into the war. Furthermore, he made it clear that, should the citizens become actively hostile against Forbes, there would be nothing he could do to influence them.\n\nAccording to James Hardiman \" ... Forbes, stimulated by Willoughby and Ashley\" - captains of the besieged Forthill - \"and governed by the advice of Hugh Peters, whom he brought with him as his chaplain ... was entirely deaf to every remonstrance of reason or discretion.\" Being unable to directly assault the town itself, Forbes landed men west of the town and took possession of the Claddagh, on the west bank of the Corrib. All of the town's surrounding suburbs and villages were burned and destroyed; dozens of locals were killed, assaulted and raped. St. Mary's Church in the Claddagh was badly defaced; in its graveyard, coffins were dug up as Lord Forbes's troops searched the bodies for rings, gold chains and the like.\n\nForbes placed \"two pieces of ordnance\", or cannons, at St. Mary's and used them to bombard the city. However, they had little effect and by early September Forbes's men were becoming irritated at both their lack of progress and lack of payment. On 7 September he cut his losses and sailed for Limerick. Forthill was once more under siege and on its own, Clanricarde's political stock had plummeted as he had been unable to prevent the sacking, and any waverers among the people of Galway were now solidly on the Irish Confederate side.\n\n \"The fort at Forthill is shown on the upper right hand corner of the 1651 map below.\"\n\nThe Parliamentary siege took place from August 1651 to May 1652 during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland. Galway was the last city held by Irish Catholic forces in Ireland and its fall signalled the end to most organised resistance to the Parliamentarian conquest of the country.\n\nThis short siege took place during the Williamite Wars. After his success at the nearby Battle of Aughrim on 12 July 1692 (old style) the Dutch Williamite General Godert de Ginkell in command of the English forces decided to capture the town of Galway before advancing on Limerick. \n\nGalways's defences were depleted but food supplies were adequate and reinforcements had been promised. The town's Governor, Lord Dillon, and the military commander, Lieutenant-General D'Ussone, decided to hold out rather than surrender. On 20 July 1692 a column of 14,000 English infantry surrounded the town and occupied an outlying fort. Other troops cut off the route by which reinforcements would arrive. Under pressure from the townspeople the Governor surrendered and the treaty was signed the following day, under the terms of which the town would be surrendered on 26 July with free passage to anyone who wished to leave and free pardon to those who stayed.\n\nThe Governor and the garrison forces were escorted to Limerick and Sir Henry Belasyse appointed as the new Governor.\n\n"}
{"id": "162255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162255", "title": "Swing (dance)", "text": "Swing (dance)\n\nSwing dance is a group of dances that developed with the swing style of jazz music in the 1920s–1940s, with the origins of each dance predating the popular \"swing era\". During the swing era, there were hundreds of styles of swing dancing, but those that have survived beyond that era include: Lindy Hop, Balboa, Collegiate Shag, and Charleston. Today, the most well-known of these dances is the Lindy Hop, which originated in Harlem in the early 1930s. While the majority of swing dances began in African American communities as vernacular African American dances, some swing era dances, like Balboa, developed outside of these communities.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, \"swing dance\" was not commonly used to identify a group of dances until the latter half of the 20th century. Historically, the term \"Swing\" referred to the style of jazz music, which inspired the evolution of the dance. Jitterbug is an umbrella term that denotes all forms of swing dance, though it is often used as a synonym for the six-count derivative of Lindy Hop called \"East Coast Swing\". It was also common to use the word to identify a kind of dancer (i.e., a \"swing dancer\"). A \"jitterbug\" might prefer to dance Lindy Hop, Shag, or any of the other swing dances. The term was famously associated with swing era band leader Cab Calloway because, as he put it, \"[The dancers] look like a bunch of jitterbugs out there on the floor due to their fast, often bouncy movements.\"\n\nThe term \"swing dancing\" is often extended to include other dances that do not have certain characteristics of traditional swing dances: West Coast Swing, Carolina Shag, East Coast Swing, Hand Dancing, Jive, Rock and Roll, Modern Jive, and other dances developed during the 1940s and later. A strong tradition of social and competitive boogie woogie and Rock 'n' Roll in Europe add these dances to their local swing dance cultures.\n\n\n\n\n\nSwing dancing was most popular in the 1930s and 1940s, but it still continues today. Dance moves have evolved with the music. Swing dancing styles are the foundation of many other dance styles including disco, country line dancing, and hip hop. Swing dancing clubs and contests are still held around the world.\n\nTraditionally, distinctions are made between \"Ballroom Swing\" and \"Jazz Dance Swing\" styles. East Coast Swing is a standardized dance in \"American Style\" Ballroom dancing, while Jive is a standardized dance in \"International Style\"; however both of these fall under the \"Ballroom Swing\" umbrella.\n\nJazz Dance forms (evolved in dance halls) versus ballroom forms (created for ballroom competition format) are different in appearance. Jazz Dance forms include Lindy Hop, Balboa, Collegiate Shag, and Charleston.\n\nDance competitions specify which forms are to be judged, and are generally available in four different formats:\n\n\nIn West Coast Swing the competitions are divided into sections by level of experience.\nThe levels are Newcomer, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced and All-Star. There is no official system in the United States to ensure that couples dance at the appropriate level of experience. Competitors should keep track of their own points and register accordingly at competitions. Once you earn 7 points in a level, you can no longer dance at that level.\n\nThe World Swing Dance Council holds a Registry of all points attained at different levels of competition, however not all competitions qualify as \"Registry Points Events\". \nhttps://www.worldsdc.com/registry-points/\n\nThere is no points system for the majority of Lindy Hop competitions.\n\nSwing dancing falls under the American Rhythm category. There are several different categories at competitions depending on what type of dance you do. Each form of Swing Dance, and each organization within those forms, will have various rules, but those most often used are pulled and adapted from Ballroom usage.\n\nJudging for competition is based on the three \"T's\" (\"below\") as well as showmanship (unless the contest in question designates the audience as the deciding factor).\nThe three \"T's\" consist of:\n\nShowmanship consists of presentation, creativity, costumes, and difficulty.\n\nLindy Hop's most prestigious events have never used these criteria, usually having the simple judging value as who was the best/most-impressive Lindy Hop couple. The Harvest Moon Ball competition in New York City, The American Vernacular Jazz Institute's Hellzapoppin' Competition, and the Ultimate Lindy Hop Showdown all fall into this category.\n\nMost competition dance floors can only hold about 12 couples dancing at a time. If the number of participants is larger than what the floor can hold, the competition will hold qualifying rounds. Once they get to 24 couples there will then be the quarterfinal round (2 separate rounds of about 12 each), then the semifinal (1 round of about 12), and finally the final round (1 round, usually 6 or 7 couples).\n\nAdditionally a \"Team Formation\" division may also be specified at a competition. Under this category, a minimum of 3 to 5 couples (depending on individual competition rules) perform a pre-choreographed routine to a song of their choosing, where the group dances in synchronization and into different formations. This division is also judged using the three \"T's\" and showmanship; however the criteria now apply to the team as a whole.\n\nMany, if not most, of the swing dances listed above are popular as social dances, with vibrant local communities that hold dances with DJs and live bands that play music most appropriate for the preferred dance style. There are frequently active local clubs and associations, classes with independent or studio-/school-affiliated teachers and workshops with visiting or local teachers. Most of these dance styles — as with many other styles — also feature special events, such as camps or Lindy exchanges.\n\nThe historical development of particular swing dance styles was often in response to trends in popular music. For example, 1920s and solo Charleston was - and is - usually danced to 2/4 ragtime music or traditional jazz, Lindy Hop was danced to swing music (a kind of swinging jazz), and Lindy Charleston to either traditional or swing jazz. West Coast Swing is usually danced to Pop, R&B, Blues, or Funk. Western Swing and Push/Whip are usually danced to country and western or Blues music. There are local variations on these musical associations in each dance scene, often informed by local DJs, dance teachers and bands.\n\nModern swing dance bands active in the U.S. during the 1990s and 2000s include many contemporary jazz big bands, swing revival bands with a national presence such as Lavay Smith and Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers (based in San Francisco), and local/regional jazz bands that specialize in 1930s-1940s swing/Lindy dance music, such as The Swingout Big Band, White Heat Swing Orchestra, and Beantown Swing Orchestra (Boston), The Boilermaker Jazz Band (Pittsburgh), the Southside Aces (Minneapolis), Gordon Webster Septet (New York), Jonathan Stout and His Campus Five (Los Angeles) and The Jonathan Stout Orchestra featuring Hilary Alexander (Los Angeles), The Flat Cats (Chicago), Glenn Crytzer and his Syncopators (Seattle), the Solomon Douglas Swingtet (Seattle), The Gina Knight Orchestra (Chicago and Joliet, IL), the Solomon Douglas Swingtet and the Tom Cunningham Orchestra (Washington, D.C.), Sonoran Swing (Arizona), and The Bill Elliott Swing Orchestra (Los Angeles).\n\n\n"}

It featured the adapted stories of children’s first-hand experiences in South Africa being retold and re-interpreted by and performed by actors such as Sir Ben Kingsley, Benedict Cumberbatch, Tom Hiddleston, Gemma Arterton and Eddie Redmayne, directed by Danny Boyle.\n\nThe play was performed on 7 February, in the lead-up to World Aids Day 2010, with 15 actors, 7 writers and director Danny Boyle participating. The play was dedicated to the work of Dramatic Need and intended to raise money for the Pete Patsa Arts Centre. Writers adapted 12 monologues from personal tales handwritten by children living in abysmal conditions in rural South Africa. These monologues were performed on stage by the actors at the Old Vic Theatre in London.\n\nThe Children’s Monologues soliloquize the testimonies and re-lived memories of young people, some still small children. Some struggled with horrible realities of death and violence, while others shared cherished moments of rare and short-lived happiness. The monologues ranged from light hearted tales of birthday parties and the joy of birthday oranges, to a redemptive tale of a gangster-gone-good to absolutely harrowing, brutally raw stories of rape and violation.\n\n\nThe music for the event was arranged by Paul Gladstone-Reid. He incorporated original recordings of the children reading their stories in Sesotho and Tswana into the score. A youth choir also performed on the night.\n"}

Ellis (June 24, 1960 – December 1, 2013), also known as the Milwaukee North Side Strangler, was an American serial killer who raped and strangled seven women in the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin between 1986 and 2007.\n\nThe North Side Strangler victims were all African-American women. Milwaukee Police Department Homicide Detective Steven Spingola authored an e-magazine article, \"The Killer in Our Midst: the Case of Milwaukee's North Side Strangler\", which chronicled his investigation of the homicides of Sheila Farrior and Florence McCormick. Trained in criminal background analysis, Spingola provided a detailed profile of the killer, which Milwaukee talk-radio host and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeff Wagner described as \"eerily accurate.\" Spingola, however, retired before Detectives Gilbert Hernandez and Kathy Hein of the Milwaukee Police Department's cold case homicide unit, reexamined DNA evidence that linked a suspect to the homicides.\n\nOn September 7, 2009, Walter E. Ellis (then aged 49), was arrested on suspicion of being the notorious serial killer. Ellis had been arrested 12 times between 1981 and 1998, when he was sentenced to five years for reckless endangerment.\n\nInitially represented by Attorney Russell Jones in defense of these claims, Ellis pleaded not guilty, and stood prepared to defend himself. Jones was withdrawn from the case, and then on February 18, 2011, Ellis pleaded no contest to seven murders or intentional homicides, and was convicted despite not admitting his guilt. On February 24, 2011, he was given seven life sentences, to be served consecutively, without the possibility of parole. After he was convicted, he was initially held at the Dodge Correctional Institution in Waupun, Wisconsin, for Assessment and Evaluation in accordance with the Wisconsin Administrative Code, from where he was transferred to the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility in Boscobel, Wisconsin. In November 2011, Ellis was transferred to the maximum custody unit at the South Dakota State Penitentiary.\n\nThe use of the name \"North Side Strangler\" in reference to the case has been limited to one local news organization, WTMJ, Channel 4, which is believed to have coined the nickname, although it has been picked up by some bloggers and by British media as well. Use of the nickname, however, has also been a subject of criticism in other Milwaukee media.\n\nEllis died at a Sioux Falls, South Dakota hospital on December 1, 2013 from apparent natural causes, according to a South Dakota Department of Corrections news release.\n"}

It had a height of and was in diameter at the base.\n\nThe origin of the word \"Wawona\" is not known. A popular story claims \"Wawō'na\" was the Miwok word for \"big tree\", or for \"hoot of the owl\", birds are considered the sequoia trees' spiritual guardian. \n\nA tunnel was cut through the tree in 1881, enlarging an existing fire scar. Two men, the Scribner brothers, were paid $75 for the job (). The tree had a slight lean, which increased when the tunnel was completed. Created by the Yosemite Stage and Turnpike Company as a tourist attraction, this human-made tunnel became immensely popular. Visitors were often photographed driving through or standing in the tunnel.\n\nConstruction of the Wawona Tree was part of an effort by the Park Service to increase tourism in the age of the automobile. Stephen Mather, the first Director of the National Park Service, was a main supporter of building a tourist clientele for the parks, which would in turn attract increasing appropriations from Congress and establish the Park Service as a legitimate and noteworthy bureaucratic agency. Mather and his chief aide, Horace Albright, who would also be his successor, worked to make the parks as accessible as possible and, with drive-through attractions such as the Tunnel Tree, as memorable as possible. Mather and Albright had already worked on the \"See America First\" campaign, trying to connect with western railroads to increase visitation to the parks. In the 1920s, the Park Service actively promoted automobile tourism. Roads and roadside attractions bloomed on the sites of Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, and Yosemite. Roads, they believed, would also increase accessibility for \"those who are not as strong and agile as you and I, for they too are entitled to their inspiration and enjoyment,\" as Albright stated in a 1931 letter about roads in the Smokies. Around this time, the term 'scenic drive' became introduced into the national vocabulary. The Wawona Tree may also have served as the inspiration for the 1946 children's book, \"Big Tree\", by Mary and Conrad Buff.\n\nThe Wawona Tree fell in February 1969 under a heavy load of snow on its crown. The giant sequoia is estimated to have been 2,300 years old. When the giant tree fell, there was much debate over what to do with it. It has remained where it fell primarily for ecological reasons, but still serves as a popular tourist destination. Because of their size, giant sequoias can create vast new ecosystems when they fall, providing habitat for insects and animals and allowing new plant growth. It is now known as the Fallen Tunnel Tree.\n\nVisitors to nearby Sequoia National Park sometimes confuse Yosemite's Fallen Tunnel Tree with Sequoia National Park's Tunnel Log. A modest notice of both the Wawona Tree and another tunnel tree appears in the May 28, 1899 issue of a \"Sacramento Daily Union\" article: \"In the lower grove there is another tree through which the wagon road runs. It is named California and is twenty-one feet in diameter at the base and 248 feet in height.\"\n\nA number of big trees in California had tunnels dug through them in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The tunnel allowed tourists to drive, bike, or walk through the tree. The tunneling inflicted severe damage to the health and strength of the trees. The tunnels were cut to stimulate automobile tourism; the cutters did not know or care about the profound damage they were inflicting on the trees. Because of the damaging effects of carving through trees, the practice of creating tunnel trees has long passed.\n\nThe other giant sequoia drive-through tree has also fallen:\n\n\nBut two walk-through tunnel trees still stand:\n\n\n"}
