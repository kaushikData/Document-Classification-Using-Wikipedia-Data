{"id": "1077137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1077137", "title": "9/11 conspiracy theories", "text": "9/11 conspiracy theories\n\nThere are many conspiracy theories that attribute the planning and execution of the September 11 attacks against the United States to parties other than, or in addition to, al-Qaeda including that there was advance knowledge of the attacks among high-level government officials. Government investigations and independent reviews have rejected these theories. Proponents of these theories assert that there are inconsistencies in the commonly accepted version, or evidence that was either ignored or overlooked.\n\nThe most prominent conspiracy theory is that the collapse of the Twin Towers and 7 World Trade Center were the result of controlled demolitions rather than structural failure due to impact and fire. Another prominent belief is that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government or that a commercial airliner was allowed to do so via an effective stand-down of the American military. Possible motives claimed by conspiracy theorists for such actions include justifying the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq (even though the U.S. government concluded Iraq was not involved in the attacks) to advance their geostrategic interests, such as plans to construct a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan. Other conspiracy theories revolve around authorities having advance knowledge of the attacks and deliberately ignoring or assisting the attackers.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the technology magazine \"Popular Mechanics\" have investigated and rejected the claims made by 9/11 conspiracy theorists. The 9/11 Commission and most of the civil engineering community accept that the impacts of jet aircraft at high speeds in combination with subsequent fires, not controlled demolition, led to the collapse of the Twin Towers, but some groups disagree with the arguments made by NIST and \"Popular Mechanics\", including Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth.\n\n9/11 conspiracy theorists reject one or both of the following facts about the 9/11 attacks:\n\n\nThis consensus view is backed by various sources, including:\n\nSince the attacks, a variety of conspiracy theories have been put forward in Web sites, books, and films. Many groups and individuals advocating 9/11 conspiracy theories identify as part of the 9/11 Truth movement. Within six hours of the attack, a suggestion appeared on an Internet chat room suggesting that the collapse of the towers looked like an act of controlled demolition. \"If, in a few days, not one official has mentioned anything about the controlled demolition part,\" the author wrote, \"I think we have a REALLY serious problem.\" The first theories that emerged focused primarily on various perceived anomalies in the publicly available evidence, and proponents later developed more specific theories about an alleged plot. One false allegation that was widely circulated by e-mail and on the Web is that not a single Jew had been killed in the attack and that therefore the attacks must have been the work of the Mossad, not Islamic terrorists. Similar e-mail narratives claimed that all Arab taxi drivers were absent in downtown Manhattan that morning.\n\nThe first elaborated theories appeared in Europe. One week after the attacks, the \"inside job\" theory was the subject of a thesis by a researcher from the French National Centre for Scientific Research published in \"Le Monde\". Other theories sprang from the far corners of the globe within weeks. Six months after the attacks, Thierry Meyssan's piece on 9/11, \"L'Effroyable Imposture\", topped the French bestseller list. Its publication in English (as \"\") received little attention, but it remains one of the principal sources for \"trutherism\". 2003 saw the publication of \"The CIA and September 11\" by former German state minister Andreas von Bülow and \"Operation 9/11\" by the German journalist Gerhard Wisnewski; both books are published by Mathias Bröckers, who was at the time an editor at the German newspaper \"Die Tageszeitung\".\n\nWhile these theories were popular in Europe, they were treated by the U.S. media with either bafflement or amusement, and they were dismissed by the U.S. government as the product of anti-Americanism. In an address to the United Nations on November 10, 2001, President George W. Bush denounced the emergence of \"outrageous conspiracy theories [...] that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists, themselves, away from the guilty.\"\n\nThe 9/11 conspiracy theories started out mostly in the political left but have broadened into what \"New York\" magazine describes as \"terra incognita where left and right meet, fusing sixties countercultural distrust with the don't-tread-on-me variety\".\n\nBy 2004, conspiracy theories about the September 11 attacks began to gain ground in the United States. One explanation is that the rise in popularity stemmed more from growing criticism of the Iraq War and the newly re-elected President George W. Bush than from any discovery of new or more compelling evidence or an improvement in the technical quality of the presentation of the theories. Knight Ridder news theorized that revelations that weapons of mass destruction did not exist in Iraq, the belated release of the President's Daily Brief of August 6, 2001, and reports that NORAD had lied to the 9/11 Commission, may have fueled the conspiracy theories.\n\nBetween 2004 and the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2006, mainstream coverage of the conspiracy theories increased. The U.S. government issued a formal analysis by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) of the collapse of the World Trade Center. To address the growing publicity of the theories, the State Department revised a webpage in 2006 to debunk them. A 2006 national security strategy paper declared that terrorism springs from \"subcultures of conspiracy and misinformation,\" and that \"terrorists recruit more effectively from populations whose information about the world is contaminated by falsehoods and corrupted by conspiracy theories. The distortions keep alive grievances and filter out facts that would challenge popular prejudices and self-serving propaganda.\" Al-Qaeda has repeatedly claimed responsibility for the attacks, with chief deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri accusing Shia Iran and Hezbollah of denigrating Sunni successes in hurting America by intentionally starting rumors that Israel carried out the attacks.\n\nSome of the conspiracy theories about the September 11 attacks do not involve representational strategies typical of many conspiracy theories that establish a clear dichotomy between good and evil, or guilty and innocent; instead, they call up gradations of negligence and complicity. Matthias Bröckers, an early proponent of such theories, dismisses the commonly accepted account of the September 11 attacks as being itself a conspiracy theory that seeks \"to reduce complexity, disentangle what is confusing,\" and \"explain the inexplicable\".\n\nJust before the fifth anniversary of the attacks, mainstream news outlets released a flurry of articles on the growth of 9/11 conspiracy theories, with an article in \"Time\" stating that \"[t]his is not a fringe phenomenon. It is a mainstream political reality.\" Several surveys have included questions about beliefs related to the September 11 attacks. In 2008, 9/11 conspiracy theories topped a \"greatest conspiracy theory\" list compiled by \"The Daily Telegraph\". The list was ranked by following and traction.\n\nIn 2010, the \"International Center for 9/11 Studies,\" a private organization that is said to be sympathetic to conspiracy theories, successfully sued for the release of videos collected by NIST of the attacks and aftermath. According to the German daily \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\", the videos that were published shortly before the ninth anniversary of the attacks provide \"new food for conspiracy theorists.\" Many of the videos show images of 7 World Trade Center, a skyscraper in the vicinity of the WTC towers that also collapsed on September 11, 2001. Eyewitnesses have repeatedly reported explosions happening before the collapse of both of the towers, while experts consider these theories to be unreasonable.\n\n9/11 truth figures Steven E. Jones and Mike Berger have further added that the death of Osama bin Laden did not change their questions about the attacks, nor provide closure.\n\nAccording to writer Jeremy Stahl, since Bush left office, the overall number of believers in 9/11 conspiracy theories has dipped, while the number of people who believe in the most \"radical\" theories has held fairly steady.\n\nThe most prominent conspiracy theories can be broadly divided into three main forms:\n\nConspiracy theorists claim that action or inaction by U.S. officials with foreknowledge was intended to ensure that the attacks took place successfully. For example, Michael Meacher, former British environment minister and member of Tony Blair's government, said that the United States knowingly failed to prevent the attacks.\n\nSome conspiracy theorists maintain that just before 9/11, an \"extraordinary\" amount of put options were placed on United Airlines and American Airlines stocks and speculate that insiders may have known in advance of the coming events of 9/11 and placed their bets accordingly. An analysis into the possibility of insider trading on 9/11 concludes that:\n\nA measure of abnormal long put volume was also examined and seen to be at abnormally high levels in the days leading up to the attacks. Consequently, the paper concludes that there is evidence of unusual option market activity in the days leading up to September 11 that is consistent with investors trading on advance knowledge of the attacks.\n\n—Allen M. Poteshman, \"The Journal of Business\"\n\nThis study was intended to address the \"great deal of speculation about whether option market activity indicated that the terrorists or their associates had traded in the days leading up to September 11 on advance knowledge of the impending attacks.\"\n\nIn the days leading up to 9/11, analysis shows a rise in the put to call ratio for United Airlines and American Airlines, the two airlines from which planes were hijacked on 9/11. Between September 6 and 7, the Chicago Board Options Exchange recorded purchases of 4,744 \"put\" option contracts in UAL and 396 call options. On September 10, more trading in Chicago saw the purchase of 4,516 put options in American Airlines, the other airline involved in the hijackings, with a mere 748 call options in American purchased that day. No other airline companies has unusual put to call ratio in the days leading up to the attacks. The 9/11 Commission concluded that all these abnormal patterns in trading were coincidental.\n\nInsurance companies saw anomalous trading activities as well. Citigroup Inc., which has estimated that its Travelers Insurance unit may pay $500 million in claims from the World Trade Center attack, had about 45 times the normal volume during three trading days before the attack for options that profit, if the stock falls below $40. Citigroup shares fell $1.25 in late trading to $38.09. Morgan Stanley, which occupied 22 floors at the World Trade Center, experienced bigger-than-normal pre-attack trading of options that profited when stock prices fell. Other companies directly affected by the tragedy had similar jumps.\n\nRaytheon, a defense contractor, had an anomalously high number of call options trading on September 10. A Raytheon option that makes money, if shares are more than $25 each had 232 options contracts traded on the day before the attacks, almost six times the total number of trades that had occurred before that day.\n\nThe initial options were bought through at least two brokerage firms, including NFS, a subsidiary of Fidelity Investments, and TD Waterhouse. It was estimated that the trader or traders would have realized a five million dollar profit. The Securities and Exchange Commission launched an insider trading investigation in which Osama bin Laden was a suspect after receiving information from at least one Wall Street Firm.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission Report concluded that \"Exhaustive investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, FBI, and other agencies have uncovered no evidence that anyone with advance knowledge of the attacks profited through securities transactions.\" The report further stated:\n\nA common claim among conspiracy theorists is that the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) issued a stand down order or deliberately scrambled fighters late to allow the hijacked airplanes to reach their targets without interference. According to this theory, NORAD had the capability of locating and intercepting planes on 9/11, and its failure to do so indicates a government conspiracy to allow the attacks to occur. Conspiracy theorist Mark R. Elsis says: \"There is only one explanation for this ... Our Air Force was ordered to Stand Down on 9/11.\"\n\nOne of the first actions taken by the hijackers on 9/11 was to turn off or disable each of the four aircraft's on board transponders. Without these transponder signals to identify the airplane's tail number, altitude, and speed, the hijacked airplanes would have been only blips among 4,500 other blips on NORAD's radar screens, making them very difficult to track.\n\nOn 9/11, only 14 fighter jets were on alert in the contiguous 48 states. There was no automated method for the civilian air traffic controllers to alert NORAD. A passenger airline had not been hijacked in the U.S. since 1979. \"They had to pick up the phone and literally dial us,\" says Maj. Douglas Martin, public affairs officer for NORAD. Only one civilian plane—a chartered Learjet 35 with golfer Payne Stewart and five others on board—was intercepted by NORAD over North America in the decade prior to 9/11, which took one hour and 19 minutes.\n\nRules in effect at that time, and on 9/11, barred supersonic flight on intercepts. Before 9/11, all other NORAD interceptions were limited to offshore Air Defense Identification Zones (ADIZ). \"Until 9/11 there was no domestic ADIZ,\" says FAA spokesman Bill Schumann. After 9/11, the FAA and NORAD increased cooperation. They set up hotlines between command centers while NORAD increased its fighter coverage and installed radar to watch airspace over the continent.\n\nThe longest warning NORAD received of the hijackings was some eight minutes for American Airlines Flight 11, the first flight hijacked. The FAA alerted NORAD to the hijacked Flight 175 at just about the same time it was crashing into the World Trade Center's South Tower. The FAA notified NORAD of the missing – not hijacked – Flight 77 three minutes before it struck the Pentagon. NORAD received no warning of the hijack of United Flight 93 until three minutes after it had crashed in Pennsylvania.\n\nIt has been claimed that Israeli agents may have had foreknowledge of the attacks. Four hours after the attack, the FBI arrested five Israelis who had been filming the smoking skyline from the roof of a white van in the parking lot of an apartment building, for \"puzzling behavior.\" The Israelis were videotaping the events, and one bystander said they acted in a suspicious manner: \"They were like happy, you know ... They didn't look shocked to me. I thought it was very strange.\" While \"The Forward\", a New York Jewish news magazine, reported that the FBI concluded that two of the men were Israeli intelligence operatives, a spokesperson for the Israeli Embassy in the United States said that they had not been involved in any intelligence operation in the United States. The FBI eventually concluded that the five Israelis had no foreknowledge of the attacks.\n\nThe plane crashes and resulting fires caused the collapse of the World Trade Center. Controlled demolition conspiracy theories say the collapse of the North Tower, South Tower, or of 7 World Trade Center was caused by explosives installed in the buildings in advance.\n\nDemolition theory proponents, such as Brigham Young University physicist Steven E. Jones, architect Richard Gage, software engineer Jim Hoffman, and theologian David Ray Griffin, argue that the aircraft impacts and resulting fires could not have weakened the buildings sufficiently to initiate a catastrophic collapse, and that the buildings would not have collapsed completely, nor at the speeds that they did, without additional factors weakening the structures.\n\nIn the article \"Active Thermotic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe\", which appeared in the \"Open Chemical Physics Journal\", authors Niels Harrit of the University of Copenhagen's Department of Chemistry, Jeffrey Farrer of Brigham Young University's Department of Physics and Astronomy, Steven E. Jones, and others state that thermite and nano-thermite composites in the dust and debris were found following the collapse of the three buildings. The article contained no scientific rebuttal and the editor in chief of the publication subsequently resigned.\n\nJones has not explained how the amount of explosive needed to bring down the buildings could have been positioned in the two buildings without drawing attention, but mentioned efforts to research the buildings' maintenance activity in the weeks prior to the event. Federal investigators at the National Institute of Standards and Technology state that enormous quantities of thermite would have to be applied to the structural columns to damage them, but Jones disputed this, saying that he and others were investigating \"superthermite\". Brent Blanchard, author of \"A History of Explosive Demolition in America\", who corresponded with Jones, states that questions about the viability of Jones' theories remain unanswered, such as the fact that no demolition personnel noticed any telltale signs of thermite during the eight months of debris removal following the towers' collapse. Blanchard also said that a verifiable chain of possession needs to be established for the tested beams, which did not occur with the beams Jones tested, raising questions of whether the metal pieces tested could have been cut away from the debris pile with acetylene torches, shears, or other potentially contaminated equipment while on site, or exposed to trace amounts of thermite or other compounds while being handled, while in storage, or while being transferred from Ground Zero to memorial sites.\nJones also said that molten steel found in the rubble was evidence of explosives, as an ordinary airplane fire would not generate enough heat to produce this, citing photographs of red debris being removed by construction equipment, but Blanchard said that if there had been any molten steel in the rubble any excavation equipment encountering it would have been immediately damaged. Other sampling of the pulverized dust by United States Geological Survey and RJ Lee did not report any evidence of thermite or explosives. It has been theorized the \"thermite material\" found was primer paint. Dave Thomas of \"Skeptical Inquirer\" magazine, noting that the residue in question was claimed to be thermotic because of its iron oxide and aluminum composition, pointed out that these substances are found in many items common to the towers. Thomas said that in order to cut through a vertical steel beam, special high-temperature containment must be added to prevent the molten iron from dropping down, and that the thermite reaction is too slow for it to be practically used in building demolition. Thomas pointed out that when Jesse Ventura hired New Mexico Tech to conduct a demonstration showing nanothermite slicing through a large steel beam, the nanothermite produced copious flame and smoke but no damage to the beam, even though it was in a horizontal, and therefore optimal position.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) concluded the accepted version was more than sufficient to explain the collapse of the buildings. NIST and many scientists refuse to debate conspiracy theorists because they feel it would give those theories unwarranted credibility. Specialists in structural mechanics and structural engineering accept the model of a fire-induced, gravity-driven collapse of the World Trade Center buildings without the use of explosives. As a result, NIST said that it did not perform any test for the residue of explosive compounds of any kind in the debris.\n\nSoon after the day of the attacks, major media sources published that the towers had collapsed due to heat melting the steel.\nKnowledge that the burning temperatures of jet fuel would not melt the steel support structure of the WTC contributed to the belief among skeptics that the towers would not have collapsed without external interference (something other than the planes). NIST does not claim that the steel was melted, but rather that the weakened steel, together with the damage caused by the planes' impacts, caused the collapses. NIST reported that a simulation model based on the assumption that combustible vapors burned immediately upon mixing with the incoming oxygen showed that \"at any given location, the duration of [gas] temperatures near 1,000 °C was about 15 to 20 [minutes]. The rest of the time, the calculated temperatures were 500 °C or below.\"\n\nSince 9/11, at least two steel-framed high-rise buildings have collapsed following blazes — the Plasco Building in Tehran, Iran on January 19, 2017, and the Wilton Paes de Almeida Building in São Paulo, Brazil, on May 1, 2018.\n\nPolitical activist Thierry Meyssan and filmmaker Dylan Avery claim that American Airlines Flight 77 did not crash into the Pentagon. Instead, they argue that the Pentagon was hit by a missile launched by elements from inside the U.S. government. Some claim that the holes in the Pentagon walls were far too small to have been made by a Boeing 757: \"How does a plane 125 ft. wide and 155 ft. long fit into a hole which is only 60 ft. across?\" Meyssan's book, \"L'Effroyable Imposture\" (published in English as \"9/11: The Big Lie\") became available in more than a dozen languages. When released, the book was heavily criticized by both the mainstream French and American press, and later, from within the 9/11 Truth movement. The French newspaper \"Liberation\" called the book \"a tissue of wild and irresponsible allegations, entirely without foundation.\"\n\nIn response to the conspiracy theorists' claim of a missile hitting the Pentagon, Mete Sozen, a professor of civil engineering at Purdue University argues that: \"A crashing jet doesn't punch a cartoon-like outline of itself into a reinforced concrete building. When Flight 77 hit the Pentagon, one wing hit the ground and the other was sheared off by the Pentagon's load-bearing columns.\" According to \"ArchitectureWeek\", the reason the Pentagon took relatively little damage from the impact was because Wedge One had recently been renovated. (This was part of a renovation program which had been begun in the 1980s, and Wedge One was the first of five to be renovated.)\n\nEvidence contradicting some conspiracy theorists' claim of a missile hitting the Pentagon have been described by researchers within the 9/11 Truth Movement, such as Jim Hoffman, in his essay \"The Pentagon Attack: What the Physical Evidence Shows\", and by others broadly refuting the role of other conspiracies in the attacks. The evidence refuting missile claims includes airplane debris including Flight 77's black boxes, the nose cone, landing gear, an airplane tire, and an intact cockpit seat were observed at the crash site. The remains of passengers from Flight 77 were indeed found at the Pentagon crash site and their identities confirmed by DNA analysis. Many eyewitnesses saw the plane strike the Pentagon. Further, Flight 77 passengers made phone calls reporting that their airplane had been hijacked. For example, passenger Renee May called her mother to tell her that the plane had been hijacked and that the passengers had been herded to the back of the plane. Another passenger named Barbara Olson called her husband (U.S. Solicitor General Theodore Olson) and said that the flight had been hijacked, and that the hijackers had knives and box cutters. Some conspiracy theories say the phone calls the passengers made were fabricated by voice morphing, the passengers' bodies disposed of, and a missile fired at the Pentagon.\n\nThe pressure group Judicial Watch filed a Freedom of Information Act request on December 15, 2004, to force the government to release video recordings from the Sheraton National Hotel, the Nexcomm/Citgo gas station, Pentagon security cameras and the Virginia Department of Transportation. On May 16, 2006, the government released the Pentagon security camera videos to Judicial Watch. The image of American Airlines Flight 77 which appears in the videos has been described as \"[a] white blob\" and \"a white streak\" (by the BBC), \"a thin white blur\" (by The Associated Press), and \"a silver speck low to the ground\" (in \"The Washington Post\"). A sequence of five frames from one of the videos already appeared in the media in 2002. Some conspiracy theorists believe the new video does not answer their questions.\n\nThe fourth plane hijacked on 9/11, United Airlines Flight 93, crashed in an open field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after the passengers revolted. Out of the four planes hijacked on that day, Flight 93 was the only one not to reach its target.\n\nOne of the popular conspiracy theories surrounding this event is that Flight 93 was actually shot down by a U.S. fighter jet. David Ray Griffin and Alex Jones say that large parts of the plane including the main body of the engine landed miles away from the main wreckage site, too far away for an ordinary plane crash. Jones says that planes usually leave a small debris field when they crash, and that this is not compatible with reports of wreckage found farther away from the main crash site. One person claimed that the main body of the engine was found miles away from the main wreckage site with damage comparable to that which a heat-seeking missile would do to an airliner.\n\nAccording to some theories, the plane had to be shot down by the government because passengers had found out about the alleged plot.\n\nAccording to Phil Molé of \"Skeptic\" magazine, \"[this] claim rests largely on unsupported assertions that the main body of the engine and other large parts of the plane turned up miles from the main wreckage site, too far away to have resulted from an ordinary crash. This claim is incorrect, because the engine was found only 300 yards from the main crash site, and its location was consistent with the direction in which the plane had been traveling.\" Michael K. Hynes, an airline accident expert who investigated the crash of TWA Flight 800 in 1996, says that, at very high velocities of 500 mph or more, it would only take a few seconds to move or tumble across the ground for 300 yards.\n\nReports of wreckage discovered at Indian Lake by local residents are accurate. CNN reported that investigators found debris from the crash at least eight miles away from the crash site, including in New Baltimore. However, according to CNN, this debris was all very light material that the wind would have easily blown away, and a \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" article from September 14, 2001, describes the material as \"mostly papers\", \"strands of charred insulation\", and an \"endorsed paycheck\". The same article quotes FBI agent Bill Crowley that, \"Lighter, smaller debris probably shot into the air on the heat of a fireball that witnesses said shot several hundred feet into the air after the jetliner crashed. Then, it probably rode a wind that was blowing southeast at about 9 m.p.h.\" Also, the distance between the crash site and Indian Lake was misreported in some accounts. According to the BBC, \"In a straight line, Indian Lake is just over a mile from the crash site. The road between the two locations takes a roundabout route of 6.9 miles—accounting for the erroneous reports.\"\n\nSome conspiracy theorists believe a small white jet seen flying over the crash area may have fired a missile to shoot down Flight 93. However, government agencies such as the FBI assert this small plane was a Dassault Falcon business jet asked to descend to an altitude of around 1,500 ft to survey the impact. Ben Sliney, who was the FAA operation manager on September 11, 2001, says no military aircraft were near Flight 93.\n\nSome internet videos, such as \"Loose Change\", speculate that Flight 93 safely landed in Ohio, and a substituted plane was involved in the crash in Pennsylvania. Often cited is a preliminary news report that Flight 93 landed at a Cleveland airport; it was later learned that Delta Flight 1989 was the plane confused with Flight 93, and the report was retracted as inaccurate. Several websites within the 9/11 Truth Movement dispute this claim, citing the wreckage at the scene, eyewitness testimony, and the difficulty of secretly substituting one plane for another, and claim that such \"hoax theories ... appear calculated to alienate victims' survivors and the larger public from the 9/11 truth movement\". The editor of the article has since written a rebuttal to the claims.\n\nValencia McClatchey, a local woman who took the only photograph of the mushroom cloud from the impact of Flight 93 seconds after it hit the ground, says she has been harassed over the telephone and in person by conspiracy theorists, who claim she faked the photo. The FBI, the Somerset County authorities, the Smithsonian, and the National Park Service's Flight 93 National Memorial staff have all individually examined the photograph as well as the film negatives and all four agencies consider the photo to be authentic.\n\nWhile some conspiracy theorists have claimed that passengers of Flight 93 and/or Flight 77 were murdered or that they were relocated, with the intent that they never be found, others within the 9/11 Truth Movement, such as Jim Hoffman and Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice, repudiate such claims.\n\nDuring the initial confusion surrounding the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the BBC published the names and identities of what they believed to be some of the hijackers. Some of the people named were later discovered to be alive, a fact that was seized upon by 9/11 conspiracy theorists as proof that the hijackings were faked. The BBC explained that the initial confusion may have arisen because the names they reported back in 2001 were common Arabic and Islamic names. In response to a request from the BBC, the FBI said that it was confident to have identified all nineteen hijackers, and that none of the other inquiries had raised the issue of doubt about their identities. \"The New York Times\" also acknowledged these as cases of mistaken identity.\n\nAccording to John Bradley, the former managing editor of \"Arab News\" in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the only public information about the hijackers was a list of names issued by the FBI on September 14, 2001. When the FBI released photographs four days after the cited reports on September 27, the mistaken identities were quickly resolved. According to Bradley, \"all of this is attributable to the chaos that prevailed during the first few days following the attack. What we're dealing with are coincidentally identical names.\" In Saudi Arabia, says Bradley, the names of two of the allegedly surviving attackers, Said al-Ghamdi and Walid al-Shari, are \"as common as John Smith in the United States or Great Britain.\"\n\nAccording to Thomas Kean, chair of the 9/11 Commission, \"Sixteen of the nineteen shouldn't have gotten into the United States in any way at all because there was something wrong with their visas, something wrong with their passports. They should simply have been stopped at the border. That was sixteen of the nineteen. Obviously, if even half of those people had been stopped, there never would have been a plot.\"\n\nKhalid al Mihdhar and Nawaf al Hazmi had both been identified as al-Qaeda agents by the CIA, but that information was not shared with the FBI or U.S. Immigration, so both men were able to legally enter the U.S. to prepare for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThere are allegations that individuals within the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) may have played an important role in financing the attacks. There are also claims that other foreign intelligence agencies, such as the Israeli Mossad, had foreknowledge of the attacks, and that Saudi Arabia may have played a role in financing the attacks. General Hamid Gul, a former head of ISI, believes the attacks were an \"inside job\" originating in the United States, perpetrated by Israel or neo-conservatives. Francesco Cossiga, former President of Italy from 1985 until his 1992 resignation over Operation Gladio, said that it is common knowledge among the Italian center-left that the 9/11 attacks were a joint operation of the CIA and the Mossad. Subsequent reports indicated that he did not actually believe this.\n\nA conspiracy theory documented by the Anti-Defamation League, Thom Burnett and others is that the state of Israel was involved in the attacks, and may have planned them. A variety of motives are suggested, including: to cause the United States to attack enemies of Israel; to divert public attention away from Israel's treatment of Palestinians; to help Zionists take control of world affairs; and to persuade Americans to support Israel. Variants of the theory contend that the attack was organized by Ariel Sharon, Mossad, or the government of Israel. Kevin Barrett, a former lecturer at the University of Wisconsin, is a leading advocate for the theory that Mossad orchestrated the attacks.\n\nSome proponents of this believe that Jewish employees were forewarned by Israeli intelligence to skip work on September 11, resulting in no Jewish deaths at the World Trade Center. According to Cinnamon Stillwell, some 9/11 conspiracy theorists put this number as high as 4,000 Jewish people skipping work. This was first reported on September 17 by the Lebanese Hezbollah-owned satellite television channel Al-Manar and is believed to be based on the September 12 edition of \"The Jerusalem Post\" that said \"The Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem has so far received the names of 4,000 Israelis believed to have been in the areas of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon at the time of the attacks.\"\n\nThe number of Jews who died in the attacks is variously estimated at between 270 and 400. The lower figure tracks closely with the percentage of Jews living in the New York area and partial surveys of the victims' listed religion. The U.S. State Department has published a partial list of 76 in response to claims that fewer Jews/Israelis died in the WTC attacks than should have been present at the time. Five Israeli citizens died in the attack.\n\nIn 2003, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) published a report attacking \"hateful conspiracy theories\" that the 9/11 attacks were carried about by Israelis and Jews, saying they had the potential to \"rationalize and fuel global anti-Semitism.\" It found that such theories were widely accepted in the Arab and Muslim world, as well as in Europe and the United States.\n\nThe ADL's report found that \"The Big Lie has united American far-right extremists and white supremacists and elements within the Arab and Muslim world\". It asserted that many of the theories were modern manifestation of the 19th century Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which purported to map out a Jewish conspiracy for world domination. The ADL has characterized the Jeff Rense website as carrying anti-Semitic materials, such as \"American Jews staged the 9/11 terrorist attacks for their own financial gain and to induce the American people to endorse wars of aggression and genocide on the nations of the Middle East and the theft of their resources for the benefit of Israel\".\n\nPedro A. Sanjuan, a former United Nations diplomat, alleged that antisemitic 9/11 conspiracy theories were quite common at high levels of the organization following the attacks.\n\nBritish investigative journalists Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan claimed in their 2011 book \"The Eleventh Hour\" that the Saudi Royal Family provided material and financial support to the hijackers and that the Bush Administration covered this up as well as their own alleged incompetence. The authors claim the 9/11 Truth movement helped this coverup by deflecting attention away from these actions. In September 2011 a \"Lloyd's insurance syndicate\" began legal action against Saudi Arabia demanding the repayment of £136m it paid out to victims of the 9/11 attacks. A number of prominent Saudi charities and banks as well as a leading member of the al-Saud royal family were accused of being \"agents and alter egos\" for the Saudi state that \"knowingly\" provided funding to al-Qaeda and encouraged anti Western sentiment.\n\nSuch theories revolve around the putative content of the 28 pages of the 2002 report of the U.S. Congress Joint Inquiry that are withheld from publication until July 15, 2016.\n\nFormer Florida Senator Bob Graham, co-chairman of the Joint Inquiry, as well as other former officials who did read the entire version of the Joint Inquiry's report, still partly classified, believe there is a U.S. government's coverup on the Saudi government officials' substantial aid provided to the perpetrators of the 9/11 act, notably the role of Fahad al-Thumairy, a diplomat at the Saudi consulate in Los Angeles.\n\nNico Haupt and former chief economist within the Labor Department under the Bush administration, Morgan Reynolds, argue that no planes were used in the attacks. Reynolds claims it is physically impossible that the Boeing planes of Flights 11 and 175 could have penetrated the steel frames of the Towers, and that digital compositing was used to depict the plane crashes in both news reports and subsequent amateur video. \"There were no planes, there were no hijackers\", Reynolds insists. \"I know, I know, I'm out of the mainstream, but that's the way it is\". According to David Shayler, \"the only explanation is that they were missiles surrounded by holograms made to look like planes\", he says, which would be well beyond the capabilities of contemporaneous hologram technology. \"Watch footage frame by frame and you will see a cigar-shaped missile hitting the World Trade Center\". Most no-planes adherents, including Thierry Meyssan and Reynolds, assert that either CGI of a passenger plane was overlaid onto a winged cruise missile or military aircraft, or that computer-generated images of a passenger plane were inserted into the video footage and plane-shaped explosive cut-outs were planted in the buildings in order to create the impression of plane impact. Some truth movement veterans have repeatedly refuted the \"no-plane\" claims. In fact, discussion of no-plane theories has been banned from certain conspiracy theory websites and advocates have sometimes been threatened with violence by posters at other conspiracy theory websites.\n\nPaul Zarembka, in his book, \"The Hidden History of 9/11\", states that the debris from ground zero was removed without a proper forensic investigation.\n\nAccording to the 9/11 Commission Report, both black boxes from Flight 77 and both black boxes from Flight 93 were recovered. However, the CVR from Flight 77 was said to be too damaged to yield any data. On April 18, 2002, the FBI allowed the families of victims from Flight 93 to listen to the voice recordings. In April 2006, a transcript of the CVR was released as part of the Zacarias Moussaoui trial.\n\nTwo men, Michael Bellone and Nicholas DeMasi, who worked extensively in the wreckage of the World Trade Center, said in the book \"Behind-The-Scenes: Ground Zero\" that they helped federal agents find three of the four \"black boxes\" from the jetliners:\nAt one point, I was assigned to take Federal Agents around the site to search for the black boxes from the planes. We were getting ready to go out. My ATV was parked at the top of the stairs at the Brooks Brothers entrance area. We loaded up about a million dollars worth of equipment and strapped it into the ATV. There were a total of four black boxes. We found three.\nA series of interviews, audio and videotapes were released in the years following the 9/11 attacks that were reported to be from Osama bin Laden. In the first of these the speaker denied responsibility for the attacks. On September 17, 2001, in a statement issued to Al Jazeera, Bin Laden is quoted as saying: \"The U.S. government has consistently blamed me for being behind every occasion its enemies attack it. I would like to assure the world that I did not plan the recent attacks, which seems to have been planned by people for personal reasons.\"\n\nIn a tape released in December 2001 known as 'the Jalalabad tape', the speaker is alleged to have foreknowledge of the attacks. The Central Intelligence Agency claimed the tape was probably from Osama bin Laden. Some observers, especially people in the Muslim world, doubted the authenticity of the tape. On December 20, 2001, German TV channel \"Das Erste\" broadcast an analysis of the White House's translation of the videotape. On the program \"Monitor\", two independent translators and an expert on Oriental Studies found the White House's translation to be both inaccurate and manipulative, stating, \"At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic\", and that the words used that indicate foreknowledge can not be heard at all in the original. Prof. Gernot Rotter, professor of Islamic and Arabic Studies at the Asia-Africa Institute at the University of Hamburg, said \"The American translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear but that cannot be heard on the tape no matter how many times you listen to it.\"\nSome members of Scholars for 9/11 Truth believe that the man in this videotape is not Osama bin Laden at all, citing differences in weight and facial features, along with his wearing of a gold ring, which is forbidden by Muslim law, and writing with his right hand although bin Laden was left-handed.\n\nIn an audiotape released in November 2007, Bin Laden claimed responsibility for the attacks and denied the Taliban and the Afghan government or people had any prior knowledge of the attacks. In an interview with al-Jazeera, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, two of al-Qaeda's alleged masterminds of the attacks, also confessed their involvement in the attacks.\n\nRichard Clarke, who headed the government's anti-terrorism efforts in 2001, theorized CIA director George Tenet ordered the agency to withhold information about Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar from the rest of the government in an effort to cover up the agency's recruitment of the two. George Tenet released a statement denying the agency deliberately withheld information about the pair and noted Clarke himself said he had no proof.\n\nIn 2006, members of the group Scholars for 9/11 Truth argued that a group of US neo-conservatives called the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), which included Paul Wolfowitz, Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, was set on US world dominance and orchestrated the 9/11 attacks as an excuse to hit Iraq, Afghanistan and later Iran. In September 2000 the PNAC released a strategic treatise entitled \"Rebuilding America's Defences\". David Ray Griffin in his 2004 book \"The New Pearl Harbor: Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration and 9/11\" argued that the treatise may have been the blueprint for 9/11 attacks. Specifically the language in the paper that read \"the process of transformation, even if it brings revolutionary change, is likely to be a long one, absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event – like a new Pearl Harbor\" was describing an alleged motive.\n\nThe Defense Planning Guidance of 1992, was drafted by Paul Wolfowitz on behalf of then Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. This was described as \"a blueprint for permanent American global hegemony\" by Andrew Bacevich in his book \"American Empire: The Realities and Consequences of U.S. Diplomacy\".\n\nMatt Taibbi argued in his book \"The Great Derangement\" that conspiracy theorists have taken what is written in the paper \"completely out of context\", and that the \"transformation\" referenced in the paper is explicitly said to be a decades-long process to turn the Cold War-era military into a \"new, modern military\" which could deal with more localized conflicts. He said that, for this to be evidence of motive, either those responsible would have decided to openly state their objectives, or would have read the paper in 2000 and quickly laid the groundwork for the 9/11 attacks using it as inspiration.\n\nConspiracy theorists have questioned whether \"The Oil Factor\" and 9/11 provided the United States and the United Kingdom with a reason to launch a war they had wanted for some time, and suggest that this gives them a strong motive for either carrying out the attacks, or allowing them to take place. For instance, Andreas von Bülow, a former research minister in the German government, has argued that 9/11 was staged to justify the subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Former Malaysian premiere Mahathir Mohamad was quoted as saying that there was \"strong evidence\" that the attacks were faked so the United States could go to war against Muslims. In spite of these allegations, the Bush administration specifically rejected proposals to immediately attack Iraq in response to 9/11, and acknowledged that there was no evidence of Iraqi involvement in the attacks.\n\nAlex Jones and other personalities hold that 9/11 was initiated by a disparate variety of banking, corporate, globalization, and military interests for the purpose of creating a globalist government. Such New World Order conspiracy theories predate 9/11.\n\nConspiracy theorists often point to Operation Northwoods as a model for the 9/11 attacks, theorizing the attacks were carried out by the U.S. government as a false flag operation and then blamed on Islamic extremists. Operation Northwoods was an unimplemented, apparently rejected, plan approved by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1962. One proposal in the plan suggested that covert operatives commit multiple acts of terrorism in U.S. cities and blame Cuba, thus providing a pretext for invasion.\n\n\"Time\" magazine contrasted events which inspired past conspiracy theories with those that inspire 9/11 conspiracy theories such as the assassination of John F. Kennedy. \"Time\" called the public assassination of Kennedy a \"private, intimate affair\" when compared with the attack on the World Trade Center, which was witnessed by millions of people and documented by hundreds of videographers; and said, \"there is no event so plain and clear that a determined human being can't find ambiguity in it.\"\n\nMany individuals and organizations that support or discuss 9/11 conspiracy theories consider themselves to be part of the 9/11 Truth movement.\nProminent adherents of the movement include, among others, radio talk show host Alex Jones, theologian David Ray Griffin, physicist Steven E. Jones, software engineer Jim Hoffman, architect Richard Gage, film producer Dylan Avery, former Governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura, former member of the U.S. House of Representatives Cynthia McKinney, actors Daniel Sunjata, Ed Asner, and Charlie Sheen, political science professor Joseph Diaferia and journalist Thierry Meyssan. Adherents of the 9/11 Truth movement come from diverse social backgrounds. The movement draws adherents from people of diverse political beliefs including liberals, conservatives, and libertarians. Anti-Defamation League has named Alan Sabrosky as a key figure in anti-Semitic 9/11 conspiracy theories.\n\nAmong the organizations that actively discuss and promote such theories are Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, a group that focuses on the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings; 9/11 Truth, founded in 2004; Scholars for 9/11 Truth, founded in 2005, and Scholars for 9/11 Truth & Justice, a group that split from \"Scholars for 9/11 Truth\" in 2007 and runs the online publication \"Journal of 9/11 Studies\"; 9/11 Citizens Watch, which was already formed in 2002; and the Hispanic Victims Group. Several of these groups have collected signatures on petitions asking for further investigation of the September 11 attacks.\n\nIn 2004, John Buchanan ran for president on a \"9/11 Truth\" platform.\n\n9/11 Conspiracy theory critic Jonathan Kay asserts that for the most part proponents are not out for financial gain and in some cases have left lucrative careers to become activists.\n\nDr Michael Wood and Dr Karen Douglas University of Kent psychologists who specialize in conspiracy theories examined the comments sections of over 2000 news articles relating to the collapse of World Trade Center 7. They found that proponents of 9/11 conspiracy theories were more likely to try and debunk the mainstream account than promote their own theories and also were more likely to believe in other conspiracy theories. Proponents of the mainstream account tended to argue for that account and showed a greater hostility toward conspiracy theory proponents.\n\nAccording to a 2011 analysis in a \"Skeptical Inquirer\" article, people involved in this movement, which seemingly is a disparate group with very diversified backgrounds, could be classified into three groups. They join the movement for different reasons, loosely self-assemble to fill different roles and are united by their shared mistrust in experts and the establishment (government and reputable sources of knowledge), and conspiratorial stance. Through their engagement, they each find their own fulfillment and satisfaction. Together, they contribute to the persistence, resilience and exaggerated claims of acceptance (in general public) of the movement. These three groups are:\n\nWhile discussion and coverage of these theories is mainly confined to Internet pages, books, documentary films, and conversation, a number of mainstream news outlets around the world have covered the issue.\n\nThe Norwegian version of the July 2006 \"Le Monde diplomatique\" sparked interest when they ran, on their own initiative, a three-page main story on the 9/11 attacks and summarized the various types of 9/11 conspiracy theories (which were not specifically endorsed by the newspaper, only recensed). The Voltaire Network, which has changed position since the September 11 attacks and whose director, Thierry Meyssan, became a leading proponent of 9/11 conspiracy theory, explained that although the Norwegian version of \"Le Monde diplomatique\" had allowed it to translate and publish this article on its website, the mother-house, in France, categorically refused it this right, thus displaying an open debate between various national editions. In December 2006, the French version published an article by Alexander Cockburn, co-editor of \"CounterPunch\", which strongly criticized the alleged endorsement of conspiracy theories by the U.S. left-wing, alleging that it was a sign of \"theoretical emptiness.\"\n\nAlso, on the Canadian website for \"CBC News: The Fifth Estate\", a program titled, \"Conspiracy Theories: uncovering the facts behind the myths of Sept. 11, 2001\" was broadcast on October 29, 2003, stating that what they found may be more surprising than any theories. On November 27, 2009, \"The Fifth Estate\" aired a documentary entitled \"The Unofficial Story\" where several prominent members of the 9/11 Truth Movement made their case.\n\nAn article in the September 11, 2006, edition of \"Time\" magazine comments that the major 9/11 conspiracy theories \"depend on circumstantial evidence, facts without analysis or documentation, quotes taken out of context and the scattered testimony of traumatized eyewitnesses\", and enjoy continued popularity because \"the idea that there is a malevolent controlling force orchestrating global events is, in a perverse way, comforting\". It concludes that \"conspiracy theories are part of the process by which Americans deal with traumatic public events\" and constitute \"an American form of national mourning.\"\n\nAustralian newspaper \"The Daily Telegraph\" published an article titled \"The CIA couldn't have organised this ...\" which said \"The same people who are making a mess of Iraq were never so clever or devious that they could stage a complex assault on two narrow towers of steel and glass\" and \"if there is a nefarious plot in all this bad planning, it is one improvised by a confederacy of dunces\". This article mainly attacked a group of scientists led by Professor Steven E. Jones, now called Scholars for 9/11 Truth and Justice. They said \"most of them aren't scientists but instructors ... at second-rate colleges\".\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" also published an article in May 2007 that was highly critical of \"Loose Change 2\", a movie which presents a 9/11 conspiracy theory.\n\nDoug MacEachern in a May 2008 column for \"The Arizona Republic\" wrote that while many \"9/11 truthers\" are not crackpots that espouse \"crackpot conspiracy theories\", supporters of the theories fail to take into account both human nature and that nobody has come forward claiming they were participants in the alleged conspiracies. This view was seconded by Timothy Giannuzzi, a \"Calgary Herald\" op-ed columnist specializing in foreign policy.\n\nOn June 7, 2008, the \"Financial Times\" published a lengthy article on the 9/11 Truth Movement and 9/11 conspiracy theories.\n\nCharlie Brooker, a British comedian and multimedia personality, in a July 2008 column published by \"The Guardian\" as part of its \"Comment is free\" series agreed that 9/11 conspiracy theorists fail to take in account human fallacies and added that believing in these theories gives theorists a sense of belonging to a community that shares privileged information thus giving the theorists a delusional sense of power. The commentary generated over 1700 online responses, the largest in the history of the series. In a September 2009 piece, \"The Guardian\" were more supportive of 9/11 conspiracy theories however, asking, \"when did it become uncool to ask questions? When did questioners become imbeciles?\"\n\nOn September 12, 2008, Russian State Television broadcast in prime time a documentary made by Member of the European Parliament Giulietto Chiesa entitled \"Zero\", sympathetic to those who question the accepted account of the attacks according to Chiesa. According to Thierry Meyssan in conjunction with the documentary, Russian State Television aired a debate on the subject. The panel consisted of members from several countries including 12 Russians who hold divergent views. The motive of Russian State Television in broadcasting the documentary was questioned by a commentator from \"The Other Russia\" who noted that Russian State Television had a history of broadcasting programs involving conspiracy theories involving the United States government.\n\nNasir Mahmood in a commentary printed by the \"Pakistan Observer\" wrote favorably about a 9/11 truth lecture and film festival held in California and quoted a Jewish speaker at that festival who said that none of the 19 suspected hijackers had been proven guilty of anything and compared racism against Muslims resulting from what he called false accusations to the racism against Jews in the Nazi era.\n\nOn November 10, 2008, ITN broadcast a story summarizing various 9/11 conspiracy theories.\n\nThe emergence of the birther movement in 2009 has led to comparisons between that movement and the 9/11 Truth movement, with both movements seen in a very negative light. Moon landing conspiracy theories have also been compared to the birther and 9/11 conspiracy theories. James Borne, a journalist for \"The New York Times\" who covered the September 11 attacks, described his assignment covering a 9/11 truth meeting as \"[p]erhaps the most intellectually scary assignment I have had in recent years\".\n\nOn August 31, 2009, the National Geographic Channel aired the program \"9/11 Science and Conspiracy\", in which the Energetic Materials Research and Testing Center tested some of the claims frequently made by those who question the accepted 9/11 account. Specifically, the experiments concluded that burning jet fuel alone can sufficiently raise the temperature of a steel support column to the point of structural failure, that a controlled demolition using conventional techniques would leave clear evidence that was not found at Ground Zero, that using thermite is not an effective technique to melt a steel column, and that even if thermite chemical signatures were found, it would be impossible to tell if thermite was actually used or if the traces came from the reaction of aircraft aluminum with other substances in the fire. The testing also concluded that the type of hole found at the Pentagon was consistent with the standard scenario, and that damage from a bombing or missile attack would differ from the damage that occurred. In the program, several prominent 9/11 conspiracy theorists viewed rough edits of the experiments, and expressed their disagreement with the findings.\n\nThe British left wing magazine \"New Statesman\" listed David Ray Griffin as the 41st most important person who matters today. The magazine said that Griffin's \"books on the subject have lent a sheen of respectability that appeals to people at the highest levels of government\". The publication listed 9/11 conspiracy theories as \"one of the most pernicious global myths\". Griffin's book \"The New Pearl Harbor Revisited\" was chosen by Publishers Weekly as a \"Pick of the Week\" in November 2008.\n\nDenver public television KBDI-TV has aired 9/11 truth documentaries several times. The stations spokesperson claimed airing these documentaries has been a boon for the stations fund raising efforts.\n\nGlenn Beck, television and radio host, said of the allegations: \"There are limits to debasement of this country, aren't there? I mean, it's one thing to believe that our politicians are capable of being Bernie Madoff. It's another to think that they are willing to kill 3,000 Americans. Once you cross that line, you're in a whole new territory.\"\n\nIn March 2010, \"The Washington Post\" editorialized against Yukihisa Fujita, a prominent Japanese politician who has espoused 9/11 conspiracy theories. They described Fujita as a man \"susceptible to the imaginings of the lunatic fringe\". It went on to say that the U.S.–Japan alliance would be \"severely tested\" if Fujita's party continued to tolerate these kinds of comments.\n\nFor the ninth anniversary of the attacks the Egyptian daily \"Al-masry Al-youm\" published an article questioning the U.S. Government story and promoting conspiracy theories. The senior analyst for the semi-official Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies and a member of Parliament from the Muslim Brotherhood was quoted.\n\nGordon Farrer, the technology editor for \"The Age\", theorized in a November 2010 column for the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" that the popularity of 9/11 conspiracy theories was a result of two main factors. One revolved around the personality traits of the theorists themselves (cynical, anxious, belief that they are freethinkers). The second revolved around the high internet search ranking 9/11 conspiracy theories receive, leading to a false air of authority to the theories. Speaking of the theorists. Farrer wrote that \"when politicians and media don't give them voice they feel more threatened, more suspicious, cornered, helpless; and so they go on the attack\".\n\nGeraldo Rivera, the host of \"Geraldo at Large\", a news magazine run by Fox News Channel, expressed openness towards claims that question the causes of the collapse of 7 World Trade Center. Andrew Napolitano, a legal analyst for Fox News and former judge at the New Jersey Superior Court, voiced support for skepticism about the collapse of the high-rise building, and for Rivera investigating the event.\n\nAlex Jones was fired by 70 radio stations when he began espousing 9/11 conspiracy theories, but by 2011 was espousing these and other conspiracy theories on morning TV shows and was the subject of lengthy magazine profiles.\n\nOn August 29, 2010, BBC Two broadcast a program entitled \"The Conspiracy Files: 9/11 – Ten Years On\".\n\nOn September 5, 2011, \"The Guardian\" published an article entitled, \"9/11 conspiracy theories debunked\". The article noted that unlike the collapse of World Trade Centers 1 and 2 a controlled demolition collapses a building from the bottom and explains that the windows popped because of collapsing floors. The article also said there are conspiracy theories that claim that 7 World Trade Center was also downed by a controlled demolition, that the Pentagon being hit by a missile, that the hijacked planes were packed with explosives and flown by remote control, that Israel was behind the attacks, that a plane headed for the Pentagon was shot down by a missile, that there was insider trading by people who had foreknowledge of the attacks were all false.\n\nToure Neblett, who has Tweeted his suspicions about the attack on the Pentagon, is one of the hosts of the MSNBC program \"The Cycle\", which debuted on June 25, 2012.\n\nCritics of these conspiracy theories say they are a form of conspiracism common throughout history after a traumatic event in which conspiracy theories emerge as a mythic form of explanation. A related criticism addresses the form of research on which the theories are based. Thomas W. Eagar, an engineering professor at MIT, suggested they \"use the 'reverse scientific method'. They determine what happened, throw out all the data that doesn't fit their conclusion, and then hail their findings as the only possible conclusion.\" Eagar's criticisms also exemplify a common stance that the theories are best ignored. \"I've told people that if the argument gets too mainstream, I'll engage in the debate.\" According to him, this happened when Steve Jones, a physics professor at Brigham Young University, took up the issue.\n\nMichael Shermer, writing in \"Scientific American\", said:\n\"The mistaken belief that a handful of unexplained anomalies can undermine a well-established theory lies at the heart of all conspiratorial thinking. All the evidence for a 9/11 conspiracy falls under the rubric of this fallacy. Such notions are easily refuted by noting that scientific theories are not built on single facts alone but on a convergence of evidence assembled from multiple lines of inquiry.\"\n\n\"Scientific American\", \"Popular Mechanics\", and \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\" have published articles that rebut various 9/11 conspiracy theories. \"Popular Mechanics\" has published a book entitled \"Debunking 9/11 Myths\" that expands upon the research first presented in the article. In the foreword for the book Senator John McCain wrote that blaming the U.S. government for the events \"mars the memories of all those lost on that day\" and \"exploits the public's anger and sadness. It shakes Americans' faith in their government at a time when that faith is already near an all-time low. It trafficks in ugly, unfounded accusations of extraordinary evil against fellow Americans.\" \"Der Spiegel\" dismissed 9/11 conspiracy theories as a \"panoply of the absurd\", stating \"as diverse as these theories and their adherents may be, they share a basic thought pattern: great tragedies must have great reasons.\"\n\nJournalist Matt Taibbi, in his book \"The Great Derangement\", discusses 9/11 conspiracy theories as symptomatic of what he calls the \"derangement\" of American society; a disconnection from reality due to widespread \"disgust with our political system\". Drawing a parallel with the Charismatic Movement, he argues that both \"chose to battle bugbears that were completely idiotic, fanciful, and imaginary,\" instead of taking control of their own lives. While critical, Taibbi explains that 9/11 conspiracy theories are different from \"Clinton-era black-helicopter paranoia\", and constitute more than \"a small, scattered group of nutcases [...] they really were, just as they claim to be, almost everyone you meet.\"\n\nColumnist Matt Mankelow, writing for the online edition of the British \"Socialist Worker\", concludes that 9/11 Truthers, while \"desperately trying to legitimately question a version of events\", end up playing into the hands of the neoconservatives they are trying to take down by creating a diversion. Mankelow noted that this has irritated many people who are politically left-wing.\n\nDavid Aaronovitch, a columnist for \"The Times\", in his book entitled \"Voodoo Histories: The Role of the Conspiracy Theory in Shaping Modern History\" that was published in May 2009, claimed that the theories strain credulity. Aaronovitch also charged that 9/11 conspiracy theorists have exaggerated the expertise of those supporting their theories, and noted that 9/11 conspiracy theorists including David Ray Griffin cross cite each other. He also claims the popularity of 9/11 conspiracy theories has hurt the War on Terror. According to Aaronovitch, because a significant portion of educated Pakistanis believe that George W. Bush brought the towers down, dealing with the Taliban is difficult \"because they actually don't believe the fundamental premise on which the war against terror was waged\".\n\nHarvard Law professor Cass Sunstein co-authored a 2009 paper which used members of the 9/11 Truth movement and others as an examples of people who suffer from \"crippled epistemologies\", to public trust and the political system. He wrote that \"[t]hey do not merely undermine democratic debate [...] In extreme cases, they create or fuel violence. If government can dispel such theories, it should do so.\"\n\nIn June 2011 the Royal Institute of British Architects was criticized for hosting a lecture by Richard Gage, president of Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth. Rick Bell, the director of the American Institute of Architects New York chapter, who was a witness to the 9/11 attacks, said that \"no amount of money\" would persuade him to allow the group to talk at his headquarters and said that Gage lacks credibility among the professional community. Eugine Kohn, former spokesperson for the American Institute of Architects, said Gage's theories were \"ridiculous\", \"[t]here were no explosives planted\", and \"[t]he buildings were definitely brought down by the planes\". The decision to host the event was also criticized by the former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects and the founding president of the American Institute of Architects' United Kingdom chapter. Gage has been warned by the AIA against giving a false impression that he has a relationship with them. A July article in the organization's magazine criticized Gage for continuing to intimate that he has an association with them and claimed there were no architects at an Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth screening held in an American Institute of Architects boardroom The Royal Institute of British Architects released a statement saying the perception that the group endorses events held in its buildings is \"regrettable\", and said they would review policy on \"private hire\" of its buildings. Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan offer scathing criticism of many of the above theories in \"The Eleventh Day\", their 2011 investigation of the attacks.\n\nU.S. representative Peter T. King, chairmen of the House Homeland Security Committee, said 9/11 conspiracy theorists \"trivialize\" the \"most tragic event to affect the United States\" and that \"[p]eople making these claims are disgraceful, and they should be ashamed of themselves\".\n\nThe hosts of \"The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe\" (the \"SGU\") have spoken repeatedly about the \"absurdity of 9/11 conspiracy theories\". In addition to critiquing the theories using the same or similar arguments as the above, the \"SGU\" hosts say that, like most conspiracy theories, this one collapses under its own weight and contradicts itself. In order for the 9/11 conspiracy theories to be correct, the U.S. government would not only have to orchestrate the claimed false flag operation regarding the airplanes that crashed into the World Trade Center, but they would also have to orchestrate a superfluous controlled demolition and cover their tracks so flawlessly that it becomes indistinguishable to physicists from the \"official story,\" yet the plan would have to be flawed enough so that \"losers in their mothers' basement\" will discover the conspiracy.\n\nFormer Canadian Liberal Party leader Stéphane Dion forced a candidate from Winnipeg, Lesley Hughes, to terminate her campaign after earlier writings from Hughes surfaced in which Hughes wrote that U.S., German, Russian and Israeli intelligence officials knew about the 9/11 attacks in advance. Earlier, Peter Kent, Deputy Editor of Global Television Network News and Conservative Party candidate in the 2008 Canadian election, had called for Hughes's resignation saying that the 9/11 Truth movement is \"one of Canada's most notorious hatemongering fringe movements\" composed of \"conspiracy theorists who are notorious for holding anti-Semitic views.\" On June 16, 2009, Hughes sued Kent, the Canadian Jewish Congress, the B'nai B'rith of Canada and four senior members of the two organizations alleging the antisemitic allegations were untrue and defamatory and ruined her career. Later another Conservative Party candidate called for the leader of the New Democratic Party to fire a candidate for her pro 9/11 truth views. Zijad Delic head of Canada's largest Muslim advocacy organization, the Canadian Islamic Congress is trying to remove 9/11 conspiracy theorists from the board of the organization, in an effort to what he describes as purifying within and totally canadianize the organization.\n\nIn 2008, calls for the resignation of Richard Falk, the special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories for the United Nations, were partially based on his support investigating the validity of 9/11 conspiracy theories. In 2011, Falk praised a book by David Ray Griffin. Falk was condemned for his remarks by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and United States ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice.\n\nIn February 2009, Aymeric Chauprade, a professor of geopolitics at CID military college in Paris, was fired by French Defence Minister Hervé Morin for writing a book entitled \"Chronicle of the Clash of Civilizations\" that espoused 9/11 conspiracy theories.\n\nIn September 2009, Van Jones, an adviser to US President Barack Obama, resigned after his signature on a 2004 petition calling for an investigation into whether government officials deliberately allowed the 9/11 attacks to occur and other controversial statements came to light drawing criticism. Van Jones said he was a victim of a smear campaign, adding that he does not currently, nor ever has agreed with that theory.\n\nThe 9/11 truth movement became an issue in the 2010 Texas Gubernatorial Republican primary when candidate Debra Medina replied when asked by Glenn Beck about US government involvement in the 9/11 attacks: \"I think some very good questions have been raised in that regard, there are some very good arguments, and I think the American people have not seen all of the evidence there, so I have not taken a position on that.\" After being criticized for the remarks by opposing candidates, Medina said that she has never been a 9/11 truth movement member and believes the twin towers were attacked by Muslim terrorists.\nOn September 23, 2010, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in a speech to the United Nations said that \"[t]he majority of the American people, as well as other nations and politicians, believe [...] some segments within the U.S. government orchestrated the attack to reverse the declining U.S. economy and its grips on the Middle East in order also to save the Zionist regime\". The remarks prompted the United States delegation as well as others to walk out. U.S. President Barack Obama criticized Ahmadinejad's remarks before the United Nations General Assembly on the following day, saying that \"[f]or him to make a statement like that was inexcusable\" and called the remarks \"offensive\" and \"hateful\". Previously Ahmadinejad had described the 9/11 attacks as a \"suspect event\" and suggested that the Bush Administration was involved in 9/11. The Iranian president repeated his claims in 2011 with another appearance at the UN and was thereafter criticized in an article appearing in al-Qaeda's magazine, \"Inspire\". The article claimed that Ahmadinejad was jealous of al-Qaeda because the stateless and under-fire Islamic terrorist organization did on 9/11 what Iran could not do.\n\nIn 2012, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has called for a scientific conference to look into the events of 9/11 and speculated that the attacks were an inside job. According to an international poll that same year, huge majorities in Muslim countries prefer to believe baseless conspiracy theories rather than listen to the mainstream facts of what happened on September 11, 2001, in New York City and Washington. Although al-Qaeda occasionally brags about its \"achievement,\" 75 percent of Egyptian citizens, for example, still deny that Arabs carried out the attacks, as a Pew study reported in July 2011.\n\nArmy specialist April Gallop filed suit claiming that Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and other Bush administration officials orchestrated the 9/11 attacks and that the Pentagon was hit by an attack ordered by Cheney. The suit was dismissed in 2010 by Judge Denny Chin, who said the claim was \"the product of cynical delusion and fantasy\". Her lawyers filed an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals which in April 2010 issued a show cause order why the lawyers and Gallop should not be sanctioned for filing a frivolous lawsuit. Her lawyers asked that the judges on the Court of Appeals recuse themselves because their emotions made them prejudge the case and abuse their power. On October 14, 2011, the judges sanctioned her lawyers $15,000 each for both the frivolous lawsuits and the accusations of prejudice. Gallop was not fined because of her unfamiliarity with the law.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41540909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41540909", "title": "British Rallycross Championship", "text": "British Rallycross Championship\n\nThe MSA British RallyCross Championship is an auto racing RallyCross series, running in the United Kingdom. The 2018 championship is known as the TOYO Tyre's MSA British RallyCross Championship. \n\nThe championship is recognised as an official Championship by the Motor Sports Association who are the governing body of Motorsport in Great Britain. \n\nThe first Rallycross event was organised at Lydden circuit, near Canterbury in Kent, on Saturday 4 February 1967.\n\nOriginally intended as a one off conceived by Robert Reed, a producer on ABC TV's World of Sport programme and organised for the broadcaster by the Tunbridge Wells centre of the 750 Motor Club under the leadership of Bud Smith, the event was such a huge success that more TV specials soon followed. And it wasn't long before 'clubmans' events were being run for autocross, race and rally drivers who'd become captivated by the new sport.\n\nThe first event was won by Vic Elford – already a successful rally driver and someone who would go on to drive in F1 and have great success as a sports car racer – driving a Porsche 911 owned by AFN, at that time the official Porsche importer for Great Britain.\n\nIt is claimed that the foot and mouth outbreak of 1967, which caused the cancellation of that year's RAC Rally, gave rise to Rallycross. However, Rallycross had been born in February 1967 and the November foot and mouth disease actually prevented some drivers attending the first Rallycross event to be staged at Croft, near Darlington in County Durham, on 30 December 1967.\n\nThere is a link to the abandoned RAC British Rally of 1967. A televised Rallycross had been organised to take place following the rally. However, following its cancellation, most of the foreign drivers and teams left Britain and the Rallycross lost many of its expected star entries. The event still took place and was won by Rootes Group driver Andrew Cowan.\n\nWith the bit firmly between its teeth, ITV ran a championship season through the winter of 1967–68, the winner of which, and the first man ever to win a Rallycross championship was Welshman Tony Chappell.\n\nITV's monopoly on the sport, its man Reed had thought up, was lost in August 1968 when the BBC struck a deal with Lydden owner Bill Chesson giving them virtually exclusive access to events at the Kentish track. ITV moved North, basing itself at Croft and later added events at Cadwell Park, near Louth in Lincolnshire.\n\nThe television companies first fought over Rallycross then ignored it. ITV was gone by the middle '70s and BBC's coverage had declined to one or two events a year by the time it dropped the British round of the European Rallycross Championship from its roster a decade later. The British Rallycross Grand Prix was the last event to be shown by the national broadcaster but that too ended after the 1994 event – the last to be run at Brands Hatch and in the event's traditional winter slot.\n\nRallycross spread to Europe within a couple of years of its creation and in 1973 the 'Embassy European Trophy' was won by Scotsman John Taylor in an Escort RS1600. The first officially sanctioned European Rallycross Championship followed in 1976 – won by Austria's Franz Wurz in a Lancia Stratos – the same year that Britain got its official British Rallycross Championship, won by Trevor Hopkins in an Escort RS1800.\n\n"}
{"id": "67371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67371", "title": "Clue (film)", "text": "Clue (film)\n\nClue is a 1985 American ensemble mystery comedy film based on the board game of the same name. The film was directed by Jonathan Lynn, who collaborated on the script with John Landis, and stars Eileen Brennan, Tim Curry, Madeline Kahn, Christopher Lloyd, Michael McKean, Martin Mull, and Lesley Ann Warren. The film was produced by Debra Hill.\n\nIn keeping with the nature of the board game, the theatrical release included three possible endings, with different theaters receiving one of the three endings. In the film's home video release, all three endings were included. The film initially received mixed reviews and did poorly at the box office, ultimately grossing $14.6 million in the United States against its budget of $15 million, though it later developed a cult following.\n\nIn 1954, six strangers are invited to a dinner party at Hill House, a secluded New England mansion. They are met by the butler, Wadsworth, who gives each of them a pseudonym, with none of them knowing or being addressed by their real names. The guests – Colonel Mustard, Mrs. White, Mrs. Peacock, Mr. Green, Professor Plum, and Miss Scarlet – are served by Wadsworth and the maid, Yvette.\n\nDuring dinner, a seventh guest, Mr. Boddy, arrives. Afterwards, Wadsworth reveals the real reason they are there: Mr. Boddy has been blackmailing the other guests (as well as Wadsworth and his now-dead wife, it is later revealed) for some time now. The group is here to confront him and turn him over to the police.\n\nMr. Boddy, however, reminds them that if he is arrested, their guilty secrets for which he has been blackmailing them will be exposed. He then gives each of the other guests a different weapons as a gift (a candlestick, a dagger, a lead pipe, a revolver, a rope, and a wrench), suggesting that one of them kill Wadsworth instead to avoid exposure and humiliation. When he turns out the lights, a gunshot rings out, and when the lights are turned back on, they find Mr. Boddy apparently dead with no visible trace as to how. Later, the cook Mrs. Ho is found dead, stabbed with the dagger, and Mr. Boddy's body disappears, only to be rediscovered dead again but with new injuries from the candlestick.\n\nWadsworth locks the weapons in the cupboard and is about to throw the key out when a stranded motorist arrives and is locked in the lounge. Wadsworth then throws the key out onto the blacktop. Colonel Mustard proposes they split into pairs and search the house to make sure no one else is there. While they are searching, the motorist is killed with the wrench by a figure that is presumed to be his former employer. Mustard and Scarlet find his corpse in the locked lounge and Yvette uses the revolver from the now-open cupboard to break the keyhole. A police officer investigating the motorist's abandoned car arrives and comes inside to use the phone. The guests resume their search of the mansion. The electricity is then turned off. Yvette, the cop, and a singing telegram girl are subsequently murdered with the rope, lead pipe, and revolver, respectively.\n\nWadsworth and the others regroup after he turns the electricity back on, and he reveals he knows who the murderer is. He proceeds to recreate the events of the night so far as to explain how the murders occurred. He reveals that the other five people who died with Mr. Boddy were his accomplices, who gave him vital information about the different guests. After an evangelist interrupts them, Wadsworth continues and shuts off the electricity again.\n\nIn the theatrical showing, at this point audiences would then be shown one of the three following endings after Wadsworth brings the lights back up. In the home media, all three endings were included, with \"Ending A\" and \"Ending B\" identified as possible endings but \"Ending C\" being how the events really occurred.\n\nYvette murdered the cook and Mr. Boddy under orders from Miss Scarlet, for whom she once worked as a call girl. Miss Scarlet then killed her along with the other murder victims. She wanted to keep her business of extortion safe and now plans to sell the other guests' secrets. She intends to shoot Wadsworth, who asserts there are no more bullets in the gun. Wadsworth then reveals himself to be an undercover FBI agent, takes the gun from Miss Scarlet and apprehends her. The evangelist is revealed to be a police chief, who arrives with cops and agents. To prove that the gun was empty, Wadsworth fires it towards the ceiling. However, it still contained one bullet, and the gunshot brings down the hall chandelier right behind Colonel Mustard, narrowly missing him (again, the first time being when Yvette breaks the keyhole).\n\nMrs. Peacock killed all the victims to cover up her engagement of bribes from foreign powers. Mrs. Peacock holds the others at gunpoint while she escapes to her car, but she is caught by the chief (the evangelist). Wadsworth reveals he is an undercover FBI agent planted to spy on her activities as to secure her arrest.\n\nEach murder was committed by a different person. Professor Plum killed Mr. Boddy in the hall with the candlestick, Mrs. Peacock killed the cook in the kitchen with the knife, Colonel Mustard killed the motorist in the lounge with the wrench (and picked out the key from Wadsworth's pocket), Mrs. White killed Yvette in the billiard room with the rope, and Miss Scarlet killed the cop in the library with the lead pipe. Mr. Green is therefore accused of killing the singing telegram girl, but Wadsworth reveals he killed her in the hall with the revolver, and that he is, in fact, the real Mr. Boddy (the man Professor Plum killed was his butler). With the witnesses to each of their secret activities dead and the evidence destroyed, Mr. Boddy now plans on continuing to blackmail them all. Mr. Green suddenly pulls out a revolver and kills Mr. Boddy. He reveals himself as an undercover FBI agent who has been on Mr. Boddy's case. He brings in the chief/evangelist to arrest the others.\n\n\nThe multiple-ending concept was developed by John Landis, who claimed in an interview to have invited playwright Tom Stoppard, writer and composer Stephen Sondheim and actor Anthony Perkins to write the screenplay. The script was ultimately finished by director Jonathan Lynn.\n\nA fourth ending was filmed, but Lynn removed it because, as he later stated, \"it really wasn't very good. I looked at it, and I thought, 'No, no, no, we've got to get rid of that.'\" In the unused fourth ending, Wadsworth committed all of the murders. He was motivated by his desire for perfection. Having failed to be either the perfect husband or the perfect butler, he decided to be the perfect murderer instead. Wadsworth reports that he poisoned the champagne the guests had drunk earlier so they would soon die, leaving no witnesses. The police and the FBI arrive, and Wadsworth is arrested. He breaks free and steals a police car, but his escape is thwarted when three police dogs lunge from the back seat. This ending is documented in \"Clue: The Storybook\", a tie-in book released in conjunction with the film.\n\nCarrie Fisher was originally contracted to portray Miss Scarlet, but withdrew to enter treatment for drug and alcohol addiction. Jonathan Lynn's first choice for the role of Wadsworth was Leonard Rossiter, but he died before filming commenced. The second choice was Rowan Atkinson, but it was decided that he wasn't well known enough at the time, so Tim Curry was eventually cast.\n\n\"Clue\" was filmed on sound stages at the Paramount Pictures film studios in Hollywood. The set design is credited to Les Gobruegge, Gene Nollmanwas, and William B. Majorand, with set decoration by Thomas L. Roysden. To decorate the interior sets, authentic 18th and 19th century furnishings were rented from private collectors, including the estate of Theodore Roosevelt. After completion, the set was bought by the producers of \"Dynasty\", who used it as the fictional hotel \"The Carlton\".\n\nAll interior scenes were filmed at the Paramount lot, with the exception of the ballroom scene. The ballroom, as well as the driveway gate exteriors, were filmed on location at a mansion located in South Pasadena, California. This site was destroyed in a fire on October 5, 2005. Exterior shots of the Pasadena mansion were enhanced with matte paintings to make the house appear much larger, and these were executed by matte artist Syd Dutton, in consultation with Albert Whitlock.\n\nThe color of each character's car is the same color as his or her playing piece from the original board game.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on December 13, 1985. Theaters received one of the three endings, and some theaters announced which ending the viewer would see.\n\nThe novelization was written by Michael McDowell based on the screenplay by Jonathan Lynn. There was also a children's adaptation entitled, \"Paramount Pictures Presents Clue: The Storybook\" written by Landis, Lynn, and Ann Matthews. Both adaptations were published in 1985, and differ from the movie in that they feature a fourth ending cut from the final film. In this ending, Wadsworth says that he killed Boddy as well as the other victims, and then reveals to the guests that he has poisoned them all so that there will be no witnesses and he will have committed the perfect crime. As he runs through the house to disable the phones and lock the doors, the chief detective – who had earlier been posing as an evangelist (Howard Hesseman) – returns, followed by the police, who disarm Wadsworth. Wadsworth then repeats the confession that he had given earlier to the guests, physically acting out each scene himself. When he arrives at the part about meeting Colonel Mustard at the door, he steps through the door, closes it, and locks it, leaving all the guests trapped inside. The police and guests escape through a window, while Wadsworth attempts to make a getaway in a police squad car, only to hear the growling of a Doberman Pinscher from the backseat.\n\nThe movie was released to home video in VHS format in Canada and the United States in 1986 and, on February 11, 1991, to other countries. The film was released on DVD in June 2000. and Blu-ray on August 7, 2012.\n\nThe home video, television broadcasts, and on-demand streaming by services such as Netflix include all three endings shown sequentially, with the first two characterized as possible endings but the third (Ending C) being the true one. The Blu-ray and DVD however, gives you the option to watch the endings separately (chosen randomly by the player), as well as the \"home entertainment version\" ending with all three of them stitched together.\n\nIn February 2011, La-La Land Records released John Morris' score for the film as a limited-edition soundtrack CD.\n\nThe film was initially received with mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote negatively of the film and stated that the beginning \"is the only part of the film that is remotely engaging. After that, it begins to drag.\" Similarly, Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film 2.5 out of 4 stars, writing, \"\"Clue\" offers a few big laughs early on followed by a lot of characters running around on a treadmill to nowhere.\" Siskel particularly criticized the decision to release the film to theaters with three separate endings, calling it a \"gimmick\" that would distract audiences from the rest of the film, concluding that \"\"Clue\" is a movie that needs three different middles rather than three different endings.\"\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film a 2 out of 4 stars review, writing that despite a \"promising\" cast, the film's \"screenplay is so very, very thin that [the actors] spend most of their time looking frustrated, as if they'd just been cut off right before they were about to say something interesting.\" On Siskel & Ebert & the Movies, both agreed that the \"A\" ending was the best while the \"C\" ending was the worst.\n\nThe film holds a 59% positive rating on the film-critics aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews, with an average score of 5.8/10.\n\n\"Clue\" has grossed $14.6 million in North America, just short of its $15,000,000 budget.\n\nUniversal Studios announced in 2011 that a new film based on the game was being developed. The film was initially dropped, then resumed as Hasbro teamed up with Gore Verbinski to produce and direct.\n\nIn August 2016, The Tracking Board reports that Hasbro has landed at 20th Century Fox with Josh Feldman producing for Hasbro Studios and Ryan Jones serving as the executive producer while Daria Cercek is overseeing for Fox. The film will be a \"worldwide mystery\" with action-adventure elements, potentially setting up a possible franchise that could play well internationally. In January 2018, Fox announced that Ryan Reynolds, who had established a three-year first look deal with the studio, would star in a live-action remake of \"Clue\", with Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers for the Reynolds-led \"Deadpool\", its sequel and \"Life\", as scriptwriters.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "16314964", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16314964", "title": "Egg tossing", "text": "Egg tossing\n\nEgg tossing, egg toss, or egg throwing is a game associated with Easter. The egg was a symbol of the rebirth of the earth in Pagan celebrations of spring and was adopted by early Christians as a symbol of the rebirth of man at Easter. \nIn one version of the game the idea is to toss an egg so it falls on the ground without breaking. This is possible on, for example, grassy meadows. In Germany, children invented a way to spin the egg during the toss so that it lands on its tip still spinning.\n\nIn medieval Britain there was an egg throwing festival held in the churches at Easter. The priest would give out one hard-boiled egg which was tossed around the nave of the church and the choirboy who was holding the egg when the clock struck twelve would get to keep it.\n\nDutch children play a game called \"egg sales\" in which one child sells an egg to another. The new owner then throws the egg in the grass and if it does not break it must be returned to the seller.\n\nEgg tossing is also known as a team competition with basically the following rules, although the exact details may vary. One member of a two-person team tosses an egg to another. If the egg does not break, they step apart and the toss is repeated. The contest continues until one egg is left unbroken. (A popular variation uses water balloons.)\n\nOn July 4, 2011, in Grangeville, Idaho, the world record for the number of persons participating in an egg toss was set, with 2,130 persons participating.\n\nAn egg throwing feat was recorded in the \"Guinness Book of World Records\": on November 12, 1978 a Johnny Dell Foley successfully tossed a fresh hen's egg for a distance of 323 ft 2in (98.51m) to a Keith Thomas at Jewett, Texas. The record was undefeated until at least 1999.

It was censored at the time of creation and was published after Oesterheld's death.\n\nThe Argentine comic book authors Héctor Germán Oesterheld and Alberto Breccia started in 1968 a number of comic books devoted to the biographies of important people of Latin American history. The first issue was \"Vida del Che\" (), and it was about Che Guevara. When it was finished and published, they started working in one for Eva Perón. However, when Che's comic book was published, it was removed from distribution and all copies of it were destroyed. Facing such situation, Oesterheld stopped the whole project. Although Oesterheld had finished the script and Breccia the drawings, the production was not finished.\n\nTwo years later, Breccia received a new offer to draw a comic book about Eva Perón. It had a politically neutral script, whereas the one by Oesterheld had a radical peronist style. The art was the same than in the unpublished comic book, but being coloured, whereas the original was meant to be a black and white comic book.\n\nOesterheld was disappeared in 1978 and Breccia died in 1993.\n\nIn 2002, the editor Javier Doeyo found the original script written by Oesterheld at the house of Breccia's widow, while searching for material for another project. With this script, he could restore the original unpublished comic book. The art was already published as described, and the colours were removed to restore the originally intended black & white by using image editing software. The script received minor corrections, fixing outdated information. For instance, the fate of Evita's corpse was still unknown in 1968, whereas by 2002 it had been recovered and placed at La Recoleta cemetery.\n\nThe work was thus published in 2002 by Doedytores. In 2007 it was edited again by Clarín, along with work about Che, as part of a series of reprints of noteworthy comic books.\n\nThe comic book describes the life of Eva Perón in a biographical manner, from birth to death. It has a strong peronist point of view, and is highly critical of the military and other political forces. It does not employ the common techniques of the genre, and hasn't any speech balloons or sequential art. The drawings are used merely to illustrate the events being described by the text. Alberto Breccia would explain that \"\"My work is testimonial, it can't be otherwise, because it includes characters like Goulart, Frondizi, Mao...\".\n\nSome pictures are made from famous photos or iconography of the time. For example, the first image (used by Doeyo to design the comic book cover) is based upon the cover of Evita's autobiography, \"La Razón de mi Vida\".\n\n"}

The event was staged throughout the city for several weeks in the mid to late summer. It was intended to attract tourists and to highlight San Diego's Spanish and Mexican heritage.\n\nIn 1955 the San Diego City Council approved a plan for a month-long celebration to take place in the summer of 1956. A private organization run by Wayne Dailard, who had served as manager of the 1936–37 California Pacific International Exposition, put on a 33-day-long event in 1956, with some financial support from the city and county. The fiesta was intended to be an annual event, but revenue projections fell short, and tourism industry representatives complained that it was drawing traffic away from the more established attractions. The festival continued for three more years but was shorter and less ambitious each year: July 18 to August 12 in 1956, July 24 to August 10 in 1957, August 29 to September 9 in 1958, and September 4 to 17 in 1959. After 1959 the fiesta was abandoned.\n\nThe festival included weeks of varied activities throughout the city, including a beauty pageant, several parades, a series of road races, a rodeo, street parties, and multiple displays of dancing, art, and other cultural activities. The main event was an epic theatrical production entitled \"The California Story,\" which had originally been written for the California Centennial celebration in 1950 and had been presented in the Hollywood Bowl. The extravaganza was performed in Balboa Stadium on a stage as long as a city block. It featured 35 scenes and a cast of 1,300 people, including a symphony orchestra and a 150-voice choir. Lucille Norman was the star and lead singer in the 1957 production. It was directed by Vladimir Rosing and conducted by Meredith Willson; both had filled the same role at the Hollywood Bowl. The production dramatized the history of California from the arrival of Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo in 1540 through the early 20th century. It was billed as \"the biggest non-movie spectacle ever produced anywhere.\" In 1959, the last year of the fiesta, the \"California Story\" production was replaced by a 2-hour show called \"Stars over Pacific\".\n\nThe celebration inspired the most popular and most-performed work by composer Roger Nixon: a piece for symphonic band called \"Fiesta del Pacifico\". It was composed in 1958–59 and first performed in 1960. Nixon explained the name of his composition as follows: \"Fiesta del Pacifico is held in San Diego and features a play on the history of the area, a parade, a rodeo, and street dances. It is one of several festivals held annually in various communities in California that celebrate the Old Spanish Days of the State, and I chose its name as representative of the spirit of those occasions.\"\n"}

Generally the term applies in the context of law enforcement and related activities.\n\nOne of the main purposes of financial intelligence is to identify financial transactions that may involve tax evasion, money laundering or some other criminal activity. FININT may also be involved in identifying financing of criminal and terrorist organisations.\n\nFinancial intelligence can be broken down into two main areas, collection and analysis. Collection is normally done by a government agency, known as a financial intelligence organisation or Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). The agency will collect raw transactional information and Suspicious activity reports (SAR) usually provided by banks and other entities as part of regulatory requirements. Data may be shared with other countries through intergovernmental networks. \n\nAnalysis, may consist of scrutinizing a large volume of transactional data using data mining or data-matching techniques to identify persons potentially engaged in a particular activity. SARs can also be scrutinized and linked with other data to try and identify specific activity.\n\nFININT involves scrutinizing a large volume of transactional data, usually provided by banks and other entities as part of regulatory requirements. Alternatively, data mining or data-matching techniques may be employed to identify persons potentially engaged in a particular activity.\n\nMany industrialized countries have regulatory reporting requirements for its financial organisations. \n\nIt may be possible for the FININT organization to obtain access to raw data at a financial organization. From a legal standpoint, this type of collection can be quite complex. For example, the CIA obtained access to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) data streams through the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, but this violated Belgian privacy law. \n\nReporting requirements may not affect Informal value transfer systems (IVTS) the use of which may simply be customary in a culture, and of amounts that would not require reporting if in a conventional financial institution. IVTS also can be used for criminal purposes of avoiding oversight.\n\nExamples of financial intelligence analysis could include:\n\nAccording to the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, financial intelligence organizations (FIUs) are national centres which collect information on suspicious or unusual financial activity from the financial industry and other entities or professions required to report transactions suspicious of being money laundering or terrorism financing. FIUs are normally not law enforcement agencies; their mission being to process and analyze the information received. If sufficient evidence of unlawful activity is found, the matter is passed to the public prosecution.\n\nGovernment organizations may simply receive and process raw financial reports, and forward them, as appropriate, to law enforcement or intelligence agencies, include the multinational Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units, and national organizations, including:\n\n\nThe United States has different organizations focused on domestic and international financial activity.\nThe United States has several laws requiring the reporting to the FinCEN. These include the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA) of 1978, the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (and other names of revisions), and the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 (GLBA). Some reports also need to go to the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nFor example, the reports\nActions that can trigger an SAR being filed include:\n\nInternational financial activity comes primarily from the Department of the Treasury and the Central Intelligence Agency. See CIA access to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).\n\nAt the highest level, US domestic FININT, and also some international work, comes under the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, heading the Office of Terrorism and Financial Analysis, including:\n\nInformation developed by these units, when related to domestic security and especially when state and local law enforcement, is disseminated by the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA) in the United States Department of Homeland Security, under the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis. This Office is not restricted to FININT, but handles collection, analysis and fusion of intelligence throughout the entire Department. It disseminates intelligence throughout the Department, to the other members of the United States Intelligence Community, and to affected first responders at the state and local level.\n\nDepending on the specific Federal violation, law enforcement investigation may be under agencies including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, United States Secret Service, or the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 attacks an allegation was made in \"The Wall Street Journal\" that tanzanite stones were being used as an untraceable currency and source of income for terrorists. This has not since been firmly established. See .\n\nThe custom common in Africa, uncut diamonds tend to be the de facto standard currency of the illicit small arms trade. Diamonds may be easily counted with a uniform valuation per carat to people in places of the world where there are no automated teller machines. An entire briefcase filled with uncut diamonds without the serial numbers found on refined precious metals can be used to make large illicit value transfers. The practice coexists with human trafficking, narcotics, weapons dealing, terrorism, and the evasion of economic sanctions and embargoes.\n\nHowever, the Internal Revenue Service has since instituted new anti-money laundering regulations to control the gem trade.\n\nAnother intriguing possibility is that a terrorist might buy stocks which are likely to appreciate in the event of a terrorist attack, such as defense industry stocks, or sell short stocks which are likely to depreciate, such as airlines. This possibility led to many investigations of the financial markets subsequent to the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nThe Financial Intelligence Unit Network (FIU.NET) is a decentralized computer network that provides an information exchange between the financial intelligence units of the European Union.

The New Bond Street, London gallery closed its doors in August 2018 after being occupied by The Fine Art Society since February 1876, the entrance facade of which was built in 1881 by Edward William Godwin (1833–1886).\n\nFounded in 1876 by a group of like-minded men led by William Longman of the publishing family, Marcus Bourne Huish (1843–1904), lawyer, editor, writer and collector, who became the first Managing Director while at the same time editing \"The Art Journal\"; and Archibald Stuart-Wortley MP. The gallery, first managed by Ernest Brown (later founder of Leicester Galleries) has for many years largely concentrated on British art and design from 1600 to the present day; with the Edinburgh premises specialising in Scottish art of the same period. The Edinburgh branch of the company is directed by Emily Walsh. The Chairmen were all drawn from the Longman family until the death of Mark Longman in 1972. Since then only Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden KT (until 1998), Sir Angus Grossart (until 2016) and Robin Holland-Martin (current) have held the position. Only seven people have held the position of Managing Director in the past 139 years, the last being Pippa Stockdale.\n\nThe Fine Art Society has taken part in key international art fairs over the years, most notably at TEFAF Maastricht, Masterpiece, London, Frieze Masters, London and at the London Original Print Fair, whose founder and chairman, Gordon Cooke, is also the society's 19th and 20th century prints specialist. The society has also exhibited in art fairs in New York, Miami, Hong Kong, Paris and Dubai.\n\nThe gallery is also known as the pioneer of the one-man exhibition, most famously that of James McNeill Whistler's First Venice Set of etchings in December 1880; the gallery having sent Whistler to Venice in 1879 in part to enable him to escape from the issues following his libel action against John Ruskin. The commission was for Whistler to travel to Venice for three months to create a series of twelve etchings. Beguiled by the city, he stayed for fourteen months and completed approximately fifty etchings. Venice also inspired Whistler to make some hundred works in pastel, of which 53 were shown in the Venice Pastels exhibition in 1881. During Whistler's absence in Venice, the gallery showed his antagonist John Ruskin's private Collection of Watercolours by J. M. W. Turner, and ran a subscription to pay for Ruskin's legal costs: a supreme exhibition of political sleight of hand. Other living exhibitors at the London premises included Sir John Everett Millais, John Singer Sargent, Burne-Jones, Frank Brangwyn, Walter Richard Sickert, Walter Crane, George Washington Lambert, Henry Charles Brewer and Joseph Southall, and more recently Leonard Rosoman, Emma Sargent, Emily Young, John Byrne, Alexander Stoddart and Geoffrey Clarke. Of many memorial exhibitions held, one was for Lady Alma Tadema in 1910.\n\nA Contemporary gallery was created in 2005, originally managed by Toby Clarke, subsequently by Kate Bryan, and most recently by Lee Cavaliere. Sara Terzi is now the Contemporary art specialist at the gallery. The Contemporary team have embraced the nineteenth and twentieth century heritage of the gallery and increased cross-cultural links, particularly in Asia, Australia and the US. Among the artists shown are Chris Levine, Angela Palmer, Annie Kevans, Jacky Tsai and Bartholomew Beal.\n\nIn October 2014 The Fine Art Society Contemporary staged the first exhibition to be held at the gallery across all 5 floors, 'What Marcel Duchamp Taught Me.' The exhibition featured artwork by 50 contemporary global artists including Sir Peter Blake, Cornelia Parker, Gavin Turk, Chris Levine, Conrad Shawcross, Keith Tyson, Michael Craig-Martin, Jonathan Yeo, Joseph Kosuth, Idris Khan, Annie Kevans and Charming Baker. The exhibition curated by Kate Bryan was one of the most successful in the history of the gallery and marked 100 years since Marcel Duchamp created the readymade.\n\n"}
{"id": "186474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186474", "title": "Friend of a friend", "text": "Friend of a friend\n\nIn sociology, a friend of a friend is a human contact that exists because of a mutual friend. Person C is a friend of a friend of person A when there is a person B that is a friend of both A and C. Thus the human relation \"friend of a friend\" is a compound relation among friends, similar to the uncle and aunt relations of kinship. Though friendship is a reciprocal relation, the relation of a friend of a friend may not be a friendship, though it holds potential for coalition building and dissemination of information.\n\nThe tendency of a friend of a friend to become a friend was noted by Fritz Heider, though he also considered the possibility that one of the friendships might breakdown, according to \"balance theory\", which his view of human triangles is called. According to Heider, the friend of a friend contact could be stressful enough to undermine one or another of the friendships. Extending the study of social dynamics caused by such friend-of-a-friend tensions to social networks beyond triangles, D. Cartwright and Frank Harary used signed graphs to indicate positive or negative sentiments between persons. In 1963 Anatol Rapoport summarized the theory: \"The hypothesis implies roughly that attitudes of the group members will change is such a way that one's friends' friends will tend to become one's friends, ...\" In September 1975 Dartmouth College offered a symposium on these dynamics.\n\nBo Anderson made an analysis of the friend-of-a-friend relationship in connection with his criticism of balance theory.\n\nConsidering friendship between people to be a binary relation, the connection to a friend of a friend is a composition of the relationship with itself. Composed relations are used to describe kinship, so it may be natural to apply composition to friendship. One consequence is that frequently a person's friends have more friends than him (the friendship paradox), which accents the reach of the compound connection. But the fact that friendship is not automatically a transitive relation produces some social dynamics.\n\nFriend of a friend (FOAF) is a phrase used to refer to someone that one does not know well, literally, a friend of a friend.\n\nIn some social sciences, the phrase is used as a half-joking shorthand for the fact that much of the information on which people act comes from distant sources (as in \"It happened to a friend of a friend of mine\") and cannot be confirmed. It is probably best known from urban legend studies, where it was popularized by Jan Harold Brunvand.\n\nThe acronym \"FOAF\" was coined by Rodney Dale and used in his 1978 book \"The Tumour in the Whale: A Collection of Modern Myths\".\n\n\n"}

Due to the increased costs of the hall, the event has become less frequent; only one ball was held in 2015, in October. Music for the event is provided by \"Brassworks\", a popular local band. The evening includes a basic vintage waltz lesson for early attendees and some small potluck refreshments. Dances are taught during a brief course before the ball begins, and include vintage waltz, schottische, polka, mazurka, and several English country dances. Occasionally, groups will form on the sidelines to dance alternate arrangements to the English Country songs; previous examples include Irish four-hand reels, the Scottish country dance \"Petronella\", the Virginia reel, and various Contra dances. Full Victorian dress is not required; the dress code is formal wear of the nineteenth or twentieth centuries. A minimum of semi-formal attire is requested by the ball staff. Although seldom exercised, the staff reserves the right to refuse entrance to those who are inappropriately attired. There are occasional performances by local dance troupes during the intermission, however there is no official dance group affiliated with the ball.\n\nThe Gaskell Ball is a favorite among dancers from the Stanford, UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz social dance circles, and is widely credited for popularizing John Hertz's \"Congress of Vienna Waltz\" and Richard Powers' \"Bohemian National Polka\" choreographies.\n\nThe Gaskell Ball is named for the British writer Elizabeth Gaskell. The Gaskell Ball originated in 1979, when the troupe playing the Gaskell family at the Charles Dickens Fair decided to hold a ball in her honor. The first ball was held at Mills College, a women's college in Oakland. In proceeding years it was held at the Veterans' Auditorium in Oakland. In the 1990s the ball outgrew the hall and was moved to accommodate the increased attendance.\n\n"}
{"id": "9524673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9524673", "title": "Get Your Gunn", "text": "Get Your Gunn\n\n\"Get Your Gunn\" is a song by American rock band Marilyn Manson, released as the lead single from their debut studio album, \"Portrait of an American Family\" (1994). The song was written by the band's eponymous vocalist along with original guitarist and bassist Daisy Berkowitz and Gidget Gein, respectively, and was produced by Manson with Trent Reznor. \"Get Your Gunn\" was inspired by the murder of abortionist David Gunn by a pro-life activist, an event which angered Manson.\n\nA gothic rock and hard rock song, the track received a mostly positive response from music critics, who described it as both nightmarish and well-produced, while Manson garnered acclaim for his vocal performance. The song features saxophone played by Sugarsmack vocalist Hope Nicholls, and an audio sample of the televised suicide of R. Budd Dwyer. According to Berkowitz, the writing of the song marked a change of direction for Manson, after which he began to write more politically-charged songs. \"Get Your Gunn\" was blamed by the far-right in the United States for the Columbine High School massacre, and multiple critics have deemed it one of the most controversial songs of all time. Its music video was directed by Rod Chong and released in 1994. The clip garnered acclaim from critics, and the song reached number 11 on the Canadian Hot 100, three years after its initial release.\n\nAbortionist David Gunn was shot and killed in 1993 at an anti-abortion protest by Michael Frederick Griffin, a Christian fundamentalist. At his trial, Griffin claimed to have been manipulated into killing Gunn by John Burt, a pro-life leader and former member of the Ku Klux Klan. Gunn's death was, in the words of \"Slate\"s Dahlia Lithwick, \"the first targeted killing of an abortion doctor in America\". The murder inspired \"Get Your Gunn\", hence the spelling of the song's title. Manson told \"Rolling Stone\" in 1999 that Gunn's death \"was the ultimate hypocrisy I witnessed growing up: that these people killed someone in the name of being 'prolife.'\"\n\nManson has said that the murder \"almost made me laugh, but it made me mad. When you think about it, it's so fucking backwards, despite the whole Christian belief of and all that.\" When writing the track, Manson also drew inspiration from his longtime fascination with abortion. Commenting on both \"Get Your Gunn\" and \"Lunchbox\", Manson noted that \"The somewhat positive messages of these songs are usually the ones that sensationalists misinterpret as promoting the very things I am decrying.\"\n\nWhen deciding the direction of \"Portrait of an American Family\", Manson and band-mate Daisy Berkowitz deicided that it would comment on what they saw as the hypocrisy of the U.S. media. Discussing \"Get Your Gunn\" with \"Noisey\" in 2014, Berkowitz said: \"When we started out [Manson's lyricism] was more psychedelic. It was weirdness. We played up weirdness rather than anything socially pointed. We got more social and political as things went on. Like with our song, 'Get Your Gunn' that definitely wasn't something that we started out doing.\"\n\nManson has said that \"Get Your Gunn\" is his favorite song from \"Portrait of an American Family\". Manson told the \"Sun-Sentinel\" that \"What's great is that [\"Get Your Gunn\"] is the most uncommercial track, the most politically incorrect.\" \"Snake Eyes and Sissies\" was originally planned to be the band's debut single, but \"Get Your Gunn\" was released instead on June 9, 1994. The single featured \"Get Your Gunn\" and \"Misery Machine\", another song from \"Portrait of an American Family\", as well as two other tracks: \"Mother Inferior Got Her Gunn\" and \"Revelation #9\". The titles of the two latter songs are puns based on songs from the White Album. The child pictured on the sleeve for the disc is Wes Brown, the half-brother of Twiggy Ramirez.\n\n\"Get Your Gunn\" is a gothic rock and hard rock song with a length of three minutes and eighteen seconds. The song's lyrics were written by the band's eponymous vocalist, while its music was written by Daisy Berkowitz and Gidget Gein; the track was produced by Manson and Trent Reznor. The aforementioned murder is reflected in its lyrics \"God damn your righteous hand/ I eat innocent meat/ The housewife I will beat/ The prolife I will kill\". Alec Chillingworth of \"Metal Hammer\" found the song's \"wacky, stomping hook\" reminiscent of the music of Jack Off Jill.\n\nJoseph Schafer of \"Stereogum\" described Manson's vocals on the track as raspy and unpolished, as well as reminiscent of Maynard James Keenan's vocals on Tool's EP \"Opiate\" (1992). Schafer saw similarities between the riff in the song's verses and the music of Helmet, and thought that the snare drums and cymbals in the song's chorus evoke the work of artists signed to Wax Trax! Records, particularly Ministry. The chorus of \"Get Your Gunn\" is \"Goddamn/oh Lord/ goddamn\". The bridge of \"Get Your Gunn\" includes audio from the televised press conference where American politician R. Budd Dwyer shot himself, including the sound of the gunshot that killed him. When Manson sampled the audio of Dwyer's suicide, Richard Patrick of Nine Inch Nails heard the sample and was excited by it; Manson believes that this interaction inspired Patrick to write \"Hey Man Nice Shot\" (1995), a song about Dwyer's suicide.\n\nAdditional saxophone playing on \"Get Your Gunn\" is provided by Sugarsmack vocalist Hope Nicholls. The track features Manson singing \"Pseudo-morals work real well, On the talk shows for the weak, But your selective judgements, And goodguy badges, Don't mean a fuck to me\". The \"Sun-Sentinel\" Sandra Schulman said that the song features \"searing lyrics on the mixed message morals of authority.\"\n\nSchafer of \"Stereogum\" ranked the song eighth on his list of \"The 10 Best Marilyn Manson Songs\", saying that \"While the remainder of \"Portrait Of An American Family\" comes across as undercooked, even for an early-'90s alt-metal album, 'Get Your Gunn' feels lean and vitriolic. Sadly, Manson seldom matched its aggression again.\" Schafer also praised Manson's \"charming\" vocal performance on the song. Jim Louvau of the \"Phoenix New Times\" named it one of his favorite Marilyn Manson songs alongside \"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\" (1997). Bloody Disgusting's Brad Miska opined that \"In retrospect, its level of cheese is of legend, but in 1994 \"Portrait\" was some dark and weird shit (see 'Cake and Sodomy', 'My Monkey', 'Get Your Gun' , etc.).\" \"Gigwise\" said that the song has \"brutal\" lyrics which \"set the precedent for the rest of the band's career\".\n\nWriting for \"Metal Hammer\", Alec Chillingworth said that \"'Lunchbox', 'Get Your Gunn', 'Wrapped In Plastic' and 'Dope Hat' are the catchiest [songs on the album]\". In a piece they wrote for \"Clash\", the Astroid Boys deemed \"Get Your Gunn\" one of their \"personal favourites\" from Marilyn Manson's catalogue and praised its lyrics for capturing the hypocrisy in Gunn's murder. Jon Wiederhorn of \"Loudwire\" praised the track for \"driving the record\" and helping the band to retain the loyal fan-base that it had cultivated prior to the release of \"Portrait of an American Family\".\n\nSandra Schulman of the \"Sun-Sentinel\" said that the song is \"Horrifyingly good, loopy music, with discordant riffs that crawl under your skin and stay there. The soundtrack to every nightmare you've ever had.\" \"Dazed\"s Daisy Jones described \"Get Your Gunn\", Nirvana's \"Rape Me\" (1993), The Prodigy's \"Smack My Bitch Up\" (1997) and Lady Gaga and R. Kelly's \"Do What U Want\" (2013) as \"tracks that provoked, thrilled and shocked their listeners.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that \"Even though it wasn't one of the best tracks on \"Portrait of an American Family\", 'Get Your Gunn' was a solid track that was a fairly good choice for a single.\" Conversely, \"The Chicago Maroon\" Matt Zakosek called the track \"weary Goth-rock junk\" and criticized its inclusion on the greatest hits album \"\" (2004).\n\nIn America, the far-right blamed the Columbine High School massacre on \"Get Your Gunn\"; Manson responded to this claim by saying that \"In my work I examine the America we live in, and I've always tried to show people that the devil we blame our atrocities on is really just each one of us.\" Due to its association with the Columbine massacre, Daisy Jones of \"Dazed\" placed \"Get Your Gunn\" on her list of the most controversial songs of all time, though she deemed the association absurd. Jones wrote that the song created an amount of controversy comparable to that sparked by \"Fuck tha Police\" (1988) by N.W.A and \"Blurred Lines\" (2013) by Robin Thicke. Similarly, a PRS for Music survey conducted in 2010 revealed that the British public considered \"Get Your Gunn\" the eighth most controversial song of all time, while Schafer of \"Stereogum\" noted in 2015 that it was \"still one of the most controversial songs in Manson’s repertoire\". \"Gigwise\" ranked the track fifteenth on their list of \"The 20 Most Controversial Songs of All Time\".\n\nThe music video, directed by Rod Chong, features Manson performing in an abandoned house. It is one of four Marilyn Manson music videos where the band's frontman has eyebrows. The video was accepted by MTV. Although it was rarely aired by the network, it was shown on \"Headbangers Ball\". Manson told \"The New York Times\" that MTV wanted to censor the use of the word \"goddamn\" in the track's chorus, commenting \"They wanted the word God bleeped, which is assbackward because damn is the cussword.\" The clip focuses on Manson's eyes, and features imagery of light coming in through windows.\n\nSimon Young of Team Rock called the \"Get Your Gunn\" video one of the band's \"classic videos\". Sandra Shulman of the \"Sun-Sentinel\" called the video \"a searing and tight piece of work\". Dan Epstein of \"Revolver\" wrote that \"Marilyn Manson might be best known as a musician, but he's also made his mark as a video artist, simultaneously captivating and disgusting viewers since 1994's 'Get Your Gunn' clip all the way up to this year's nympho-nuns-with-guns visual 'We Know Where You Fucking Live'.\" MTV's Rob Mancini viewed the video for \"Get Your Gunn\" as one of Marilyn Manson's \"early nuggets\".\n\n\"Get Your Gunn\" appeared on the soundtracks for the films \"S.F.W.\" (1994) and \"Strange Days\" (1995).\n\nAll songs written by Manson, Berkowitz and Gein, except 2 by Manson, Berkowitz, Gein and Madonna Wayne Gacy, and 4 by Manson and Gacy.\n\n\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of the \"Get Your Gunn\" single.\n\nMarilyn Manson\n\nAdditional musicians and technical personnel\n\n\n\n"}

The festival itself was held at the end of the wheat harvest and took the form of a vast feast usually around the time of the autumnal equinox. The ceremony of Crying The Neck took place before the feast, the neck being formed into a Corn dolly, which presided over the celebrations. Since 2008 a revived Guldize celebration has been held in Penzance and since 2010 in several other locations across Cornwall.\n\nA. K.

A number of songs in particular have been recorded as being sung on these occasions, including \"Green Brooms\", \"Here's a health to the barley mow\", and \"Harvest Home\".\n\nA number of customs also were associated with the feast; a man would have been chosen to rush to the site of the feast with the corn neck and enter the building by stealth avoiding an appointed lady who would have soaked the carrier of the neck if discovered. If this game was successful then the carrier of the neck would have been entitled to take a kiss from female \"guard\" of the property.\n\nThe earliest reference to Guldize was in 1602 by Richard Carew in his \"Survey of Cornwall\".\n\n\n"}

The movement began with the online publication of a handbook written by Congressional staffers with suggestions for peacefully but effectively resisting the move to the right in the executive branch of the United States government under the Trump administration that was widely anticipated and feared by progressives. The goal of Indivisible, according to Peter Dreier, is to \"save American democracy\" and \"resume the project of creating a humane America that is more like social democracy than corporate plutocracy.\"\n\nThe movement started with the online publication of a 23-page handbook, \"Indivisible: A Practical Guide for Resisting the Trump Agenda\". The authors of the document, most notably Ezra Levin, Jeremy Haile, Leah Greenberg, and Angel Padilla, were former Congressional staffers. Greenberg worked as an aide to Democratic Representative Tom Perriello of Virginia, while Levin, Greenberg's husband, worked as an aide to Lloyd Doggett, a Democratic Party member of the United States House of Representatives from Texas. After the 2016 presidential election, in mid-December 2016, Levin and Greenberg began working on an online guide in the form of a Google Document on how to make contact with congressional aides as a way of grieving over Trump's victory. Angel Padilla, and Jeremy Haile, and dozens of other staffers for Democratic members of the United States Congress joined in the creation of the online publication.\n\nThe authors modeled their document after the Tea Party movement, which focused on local activism and obstructing the Democratic Party's agenda following the election of President Barack Obama in 2008. They thought that similar action taken by the left could be effective against what they perceived as Trump's \"bigoted and anti-democratic agenda.\" The purpose of the guide was to encourage resistance to Trump's presidency, most notably by targeting Republican elected members of Congress by attending town halls, calling congressional officials, visiting their offices, and showing up at public events. \n\nIt was first published online on Google Docs on December 14, 2016, with Levin posting a link to it on his personal Twitter account. It soon went viral, with, among others, Robert Reich, Jonathan Chait, George Takei and Miranda July circulating it online.\n\nSince the guide's publication, its authors have created a website with further resources on using the guide and organizing local movements. The guide is continuously updated and is available in English and Spanish. By February 4, 2017, less than two months from the publication of the Indivisible Guide, and about two weeks after Trump's inauguration, more than 3,800 local groups identifying as \"Indivisibles\" had formed and declared their support for the movement. In February, they organized as a 501(c) organization.\n\nMany groups attended town halls, demonstrated against nominees for Trump's Cabinet, and worked with organizers of the Women's March. John Kasich and Mo Brooks acknowledged that the protests would impact efforts to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The movement was cited as a cause for the initial failure of Republicans to pass the American Health Care Act of 2017.\n\n\n"}

The incident helped to initiate large-scale changes in the local rural economy, engendering a massive redistribution of land in the region.\n\nThe incident occurred when the landless peasants were influenced by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) to organise themselves into a campaign for higher wages following the increase in agricultural production as the result of Green revolution in India.\nThe lands were controlled by powerful families, while the labourers were from a Dalit community. In 1968, the agricultural labourers of unified Tanjore district formed a union seeking better working conditions and higher wages. To mark their union the workers hoisted red flags in their villages, irking their landlords. The landlords formed a separate union with yellow flags and started laying off workers belonging to the Communist unions.\n\nThis led to tensions and finally a boycott by all labourers. The peasants withheld part of the harvest as a negotiating tactic. The Paddy Producers Association, representing the local landlords, organised external labourers to continue the harvest. Matters became fraught when a local shopkeeper who supported the protesters was kidnapped by supporters of the landlords and beaten up. Protesters attacked the kidnappers, forcing them to release their hostage. In the clash, one of the landlords' agents was killed.\n\nAccording to eye witness accounts, on 25 December 1968, at around 10 p.m., the landlords and their 200 henchmen came in Police lorries and surrounded the hutments, cutting off all routes of escape. The attackers shot at the labourers, mortally wounding two of them. Labourers and their families could only throw stones to protect themselves or flee from the spot. Many of the women and children, and some old men, took refuge in a hut that was 8 ft x 9 ft. But the attackers surrounded it and set fire to it, burning them to death. The fire was systematically stoked with hay and dry wood. Two children thrown out from the burning hut in the hope that they would survive were thrown back into the flames by the arsonists. Of six people who managed to come out of the burning hut, two of whom were caught, hacked to death and thrown back into the flame. Post this heinous crime, attackers went straight to the police station, demanded protection against reprisals and got it. The massacre resulted in death of 44, including 5 aged men, 16 women and 23 children.\n\nReacting to the carnage, the then Chief Minister C. Annadurai, sent two of his Cabinet Ministers – PWD Minister M Karunanidhi and Law Minister S. Madhavan- to the site of the incident. He also conveyed his condolences and promised action.\n\nIn the subsequent trial, the landlords were convicted of involvement in the event. Ten of them were sentenced to 10 years in jail. However, an appeal court overturned the conviction. Irinjur Gopalakrishnan Naidu, leader of the Paddy Producers Association, was accused of being behind the massacre. the Madras High Court acquitted the landlord in 1975, quashing the Nagapattinam district court judgment awarding him 10 years of imprisonment in 1970.but was murdered in a revenge attack in 1980.\n\nThe massacre led to widespread demand for changes in land ownership and to attitudes regarding caste. Gandhian reformer Krishnammal Jagannathan and her husband led a series of non-violent demonstrations, arguing for the redistribution of land owned by the local Hindu temple and Trust lands in Valivalam to members of the Dalit caste. The couple also founded an organisation to promote their aims. Krishnammal Jeganathan later said, on the eve of a commemoration of the massacre, \"I could not sleep last night, and the sight of the violence feels fresh in my mind - fresh blood of a butchered child, and charred bodies of women and children, who had taken refuge in a hut\".\n\nFeminist activists played a significant role in making the massacre well known. Six years after the killings the first state conference of the Democratic Women's Association was held in Kizhavenmani. Mythili Sivaraman helped to publicize the atrocities through her articles and essays. A collection of her writings about the incident was released as a book named \"Haunted by Fire\".\n\nPeriyar,a month later speaks about the event,“wage is not something you can demand, a wage is that which is fixed by market conditions”,and he blamed the Communists for the massacre.\n\nThe Communist Party of India (Marxist) organises an annual \"Venmani Martyrs Day\" to commemorate the massacre. Foundation stone for memorial was laid by Jyoti Basu in 1969 when he was Deputy Chief Minister of West Bengal. The memorial was erected by the party in the form of a black granite monolith carved with the names of the forty-four victims, including fourteen victims from one family. It is topped with the hammer and sickle of the CPI(M). A plantain bud \"carved out of monolithic red granite mounted on a platform serves as a memory of the dead\".\nOther political groups have also participated in the commemorations. The Dalit political party Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi have objected to Communist control of the event. Its district secretary S. Vivekanandam said, \"We also want to pay tributes to the martyrs. But the CPM does not allow us to arrange for any programmes during the anniversary saying that only their party stood in support of the farmers of Keezhvenmani. They also said that they had got the place of massacre registered in their party's name. It is unacceptable that a single party claims ownership of the historical place\".\n\nIn 2006, the CPI(M) announced that it would begin the construction of a much larger memorial (referred to as \"Mani Mandapam\"). In 2014, the partially completed new memorial was inaugurated by the party. It comprises 44 granite pillars, representing each of the victims, surrounding a large building functioning as a museum and centre of commemoration.\n\n\n\n"}

Her body was not identified until 2013. The case received national attention due to the young age of the victim and the manner of her death. After her identification, Castillo's paternal cousin, Conrado Juarez (30 years old at the time of her death) confessed to murdering the girl. Juarez died in custody in November 2018.\n\nCastillo's abusive father, Genaro Ramirez, had taken two of his three young children and disappeared – her mother, Margarita Castillo, figured that he had taken Anjelica and her sister and returned to his native Mexico. In reality, he left Anjelica in New York, taking her to stay with the children's grown cousin, Balvina Juarez-Ramirez, who lived in a house in Astoria, Queens.\n\nYears later, Balvina's brother/Anjelica's cousin, Conrado Juarez, admitted to torturing, raping and sodomizing the child before smothering her. Juarez, who was 30 years old at the time of the murder, had bound Anjelica to a table in his sister's apartment and deprived her of water on multiple occasions. Juarez claimed he originally did not intend to kill her but then suffocated her with a pillow after she cried out during her rape. Juarez immediately informed Juarez-Ramirez that their cousin was dead, and his sister insisted they dispose of the body. Anjelica's body was placed in a cooler, and the siblings took a car service to Manhattan to dump the cooler.\n\nAnjelica's mother, believing her likely in Mexico with the father, and also unable to communicate in English, never reported her missing. Margarita did claim that she and her family had searched for her daughter but were unable to locate her, for which she became the subject of much criticism and anger when Anjelica was identified in 2013. Other reports reveal that her family also neglected to report her missing, as some of the family members, including Margarita, were apparently undocumented immigrants. They feared that if it was discovered that some were in the country without documentation during the course of an investigation, they would be deported.\n\nAnjelica's decomposing body was discovered on July 23, 1991, inside a navy blue cooler along the Henry Hudson Parkway in Manhattan, New York. The body was so decomposed that identification was at first impossible, as her face was not recognizable—she soon came to be known as \"Baby Hope\". She was naked and had been bound with both rope and a Venetian blind cord. She was placed in a fetal position with her hands pressed together. The body was then wrapped in a garbage bag and placed inside the cooler, which was filled with unopened soda cans and water (which was presumably ice at one time). Examiners concluded that \"Baby Hope\" was possibly Hispanic, had dark, wavy hair in a ponytail, was malnourished, weighing only , was a victim of sexual abuse, and had died on-or-about July 18. She was initially estimated to have been between three and five years old.\n\nAfter examination was completed and the case remained unsolved, police provided the money in 1993 to have the victim buried after a public funeral was held. A casket was donated in which to bury the little girl, and her headstone was marked as \"Baby Hope\". One of the officers who was investigating the case gave a eulogy. Two hundred people attended.\n\nAfter the remains were originally discovered, a witness told authorities that she had seen a Hispanic man and woman carrying a cooler in the location where the body was found, prior to the discovery, around the time the girl was estimated to have been murdered. A few months later, in the autumn of 1991, some images of a nude child were located in New Jersey, which some believed might have been \"Baby Hope\", as the girl in the photographs matched the victim's description.\n\"Baby Hope's\" body was exhumed in 2006 and 2011 to obtain DNA information. Authorities reopened the case in 2013 and requested information from the public. The tip that broke the case came from an anonymous woman who told authorities that she had overheard a conversation two years prior between a mother and another person regarding the disappearance of her daughter. This information led investigators to Margarita Castillo, and DNA comparisons confirmed that she was the mother of \"Baby Hope\"—who could now be identified as Anjelica Castillo.\n\nNow that Anjelica was identified, a sign with her name was placed on her headstone, which had been marked as \"Baby Hope\".\n\nOnce investigators had identified Anjelica and her family, further effort led them to the names of her paternal cousins – 52-year-old Conrado Juarez and his already deceased sister, Balvina Juarez-Ramirez. Juarez was questioned by detectives after being located working as a dishwasher in a restaurant in Manhattan. The subsequent interrogation led to his arrest for the crime. He was initially believed to have traveled back to his native Mexico before his arrest. He was subsequently charged with felony murder. Police stated that they also suspect that Anjelica may not have been Juarez's only victim.\n\nWhen first interviewed by reporters, Margarita Castillo refused to show her face but spoke through a closed door. She gave her explanation of why Anjelica was not reported missing and also described her devastation when she learned of the fate of Anjelica, and her anger toward Juarez. She was subjected to criticism throughout the community for not reporting anything about Anjelica's disappearance.\n\nSome members and friends of Anjelica's family had never known she had even existed. Anjelica's sister, Laurencita Ramirez, spoke to reporters about the case. When she was 11 she learned about Anjelica's existence and abduction by their father years earlier. Ramirez stated that she did not become familiar with \"Baby Hope\" until the case was re-opened and publicized in 2013. When she saw the artist recreations in the media, she saw a resemblance between the victim and herself and wondered if the still unidentified \"Baby Hope\" might be the missing sister she had heard about.\n\nWhen Anjelica was first identified, her father, Genaro Ramirez, was believed to be involved in her death, until Juarez confessed. To date Genaro Ramirez has never been located, but is believed to reside in Puebla, Mexico, and may still be unaware of what happened to his daughter after he gave her to Juarez. Juarez later claimed his confession was coerced and told a different account of Castillo's death, claiming his sister asked for assistance after the girl died from falling down the stairs. He later entered a \"not guilty\" plea when charged with second degree murder. Juarez died in police custody on November 19, 2018 from pancreatic cancer.\n\n"}
{"id": "944646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=944646", "title": "Origins of rock and roll", "text": "Origins of rock and roll\n\nRock and roll emerged as a defined musical style in the United States in the early to mid-1950s. It derived most directly from the rhythm and blues music of the 1940s, which itself developed from earlier blues, boogie woogie, jazz and swing music, and was also influenced by gospel, country and western, and traditional folk music. Rock and roll in turn provided the main basis for the music that, since the mid-1960s, has been generally known simply as rock music.\n\nThe phrase \"rocking and rolling\" originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean, but it was used by the early 20th century, both to describe a spiritual fervor and as a sexual analogy. Various gospel, blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became used more frequently – but still intermittently – in the late 1930s and 1940s, principally on recordings and in reviews of what became known as \"rhythm and blues\" music aimed at black audiences. In 1951, Cleveland-based disc jockey Alan Freed began playing this music style while popularizing the term \"rock and roll\" to describe it.\n\nVarious recordings that date back to the 1940s have been named as the first rock and roll record.\n\nThe alliterative phrase \"rocking and rolling\" originally was used by mariners at least as early as the 17th century to describe the combined \"rocking\" (fore and aft) and \"rolling\" (side to side) motion of a ship on the ocean. Examples include an 1821 reference, \"... prevent her from rocking and rolling ...\", and an 1835 reference to a ship \"... rocking and rolling on both beam-ends\". As the term referred to movement forwards, backwards and from side to side, it acquired sexual connotations from early on; the sea shanty \"Johnny Bowker\" (or \"Boker\"), probably from the early 19th century, contains the lines \"Oh do, my Johnny Bowker/ Come rock and roll me over\".\n\nThe hymn \"Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep\", with words written in the 1830s by Emma Willard and tune by Joseph Philip Knight, was recorded several times around the start of the 20th century by the Original Bison City Quartet before 1894, the Standard Quartette in 1895, John W. Myers at about the same time, and Gus Reed in 1908. By that time, the specific phrase \"rocking and rolling\" was also used by African Americans in spirituals with a religious connotation.\n\nA comic song titled \"Rock and Roll Me\" was performed by Johnny Gardner of the Moore's Troubadours theatrical group during a performance in Australia in 1886, and one newspaper critic wrote that Gardner \"made himself so amusing that the large audience fairly rocked and rolled with laughter.\" \n\nThe earliest known recording of the phrase in use was on a 1904 Victor phonograph record \"The Camp Meeting Jubilee\" by the Haydn Quartet, with the words \"We've been rockin' an' rolling in your arms/ Rockin' and rolling in your arms/ Rockin' and rolling in your arms/ In the arms of Moses.\" Another version was issued on the Little Wonder record label in 1916. \"Rocking\" was also used to describe the spiritual rapture felt by worshippers at certain religious events, and to refer to the rhythm often found in the accompanying music.\n\nAt the same time, the terminology was used in secular contexts, for example to describe the motion of railroad trains. It has been suggested that it also was used by men building railroads, who would sing to keep the pace, swinging their hammers down to drill a hole into the rock, and the men who held the steel spikes would \"rock\" the spike back and forth to clear rock or \"roll\", twisting it to improve the \"bite\" of the drill. \"Rocking\" and \"rolling\" were also used, both separately and together, in a sexual context; writers for hundreds of years had used the phrases \"They had a roll in the hay\" or \"I rolled her in the clover\".\n\nBy the early 20th century the words increasingly were used together in secular black slang with a double meaning, ostensibly referring to dancing and partying, but often with the subtextual meaning of sex.\n\nIn 1922, blues singer Trixie Smith recorded \"My Man Rocks Me (with One Steady Roll),\" first featuring the two words in a secular context. Although it was played with a backbeat and was one of the first \"around the clock\" lyrics, this slow minor-key blues was by no means \"rock and roll\" in the later sense. However, the terms \"rocking\", and \"rocking and rolling\", were increasingly used through the 1920s and 1930s, especially but not exclusively by black secular musicians, to refer to either dancing or sex, or both. In 1927, blues singer Blind Blake used the couplet \"Now we gonna do the old country rock / First thing we do, swing your partners\" in \"West Coast Blues\", which in turn formed the basis of \"Old Country Rock\" by William Moore the following year. Also in 1927, traditional country musician Uncle Dave Macon, with his group the Fruit Jar Drinkers, recorded \"Sail Away Ladies\" with a refrain of \"Don't she rock, daddy-o\", and \"Rock About My Saro Jane\". Duke Ellington recorded \"Rockin' in Rhythm\" in 1928, and Robinson's Knights of Rest recorded \"Rocking and Rolling\" in 1930.\n\nIn 1932, the phrase \"rock and roll\" was heard in the Hal Roach film \"Asleep in the Feet\". In 1934, the Boswell Sisters had a pop hit with \"Rock and Roll\" from the film \"Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round\", where the term was used to describe the motion of a ship at sea. In 1935, Henry \"Red\" Allen recorded \"Get Rhythm in Your Feet and Music in Your Soul\" which included the lyric \"If Satan starts to hound you, commence to rock and roll / Get rhythm in your feet...\" The lyrics were written by the prolific composer J. Russel Robinson with Bill Livingston. Allen's recording was a \"race\" record on the Vocalion label, but the tune was quickly covered by white musicians, notably Benny Goodman with singer Helen Ward.\n\nOther notable recordings using the words, both released in 1938, were \"Rock It for Me\" by Chick Webb, a swing number with Ella Fitzgerald on vocals featuring the lyrics \"... Won't you satisfy my soul, With the rock and roll?\"; and \"Rock Me\" by Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a gospel song originally written by Thomas Dorsey as \"Hide Me in Thy Bosom\". Tharpe performed the song in the style of a city blues, with secular lyrics, ecstatic vocals and electric guitar. She changed Dorsey's \"singing\" to \"swinging,\" and the way she rolled the \"R\" in \"rock me\" led to the phrase being taken as a double entendre, with the interpretation as religious or sexual.\n\nThe following year, Western swing musician Buddy Jones recorded \"Rockin' Rollin' Mama\", which drew on the term's original meaning – \"Waves on the ocean, waves in the sea/ But that gal of mine rolls just right for me/ Rockin' rollin' mama, I love the way you rock and roll\". In August 1939, Irene Castle devised a new dance called \"The Castle Rock and Roll\", described as \"an easy swing step\", which she performed at the Dancing Masters of America convention at the Hotel Astor. The Marx Brothers' 1941 film \"The Big Store\" featured actress Virginia O'Brien singing a song starting out as a traditional lullaby which soon changes into a rocking boogie-woogie with lines like \"Rock, rock, rock it, baby ...\"'. Although the song was only a short comedy number, it contains references which, by then, would have been understood by a wide general audience.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", an early use of the word \"rock\" in describing a style of music was in a review in \"Metronome\" magazine on July 21, 1938, which stated that \"Harry James' \"Lullaby in Rhythm\" really rocks.\" In 1939, a review of \"Ciribiribin\" and \"Yodelin' Jive\" by the Andrews Sisters with Bing Crosby, in the journal \"The Musician\", stated that the songs \"... rock and roll with unleashed enthusiasm tempered to strict four-four time\".\n\nBy the early 1940s, the term \"rock and roll\" also was being used in record reviews by \"Billboard\" journalist and columnist Maurie Orodenker. In the May 30, 1942 issue, for instance, he described Sister Rosetta Tharpe's vocals on a re-recording of \"Rock Me\" with Lucky Millinder's band as \"rock-and-roll spiritual singing\", and on October 3, 1942, he described Count Basie's \"It's Sand, Man!\" as \"an instrumental screamer.. [which].. displays its rock and roll capacities when tackling the righteous rhythms.\" In the April 25, 1945 edition, Orodenker described Erskine Hawkins' version of \"Caldonia\" as \"right rhythmic rock and roll music\", a phrase precisely repeated in his 1946 review of \"Sugar Lump\" by Joe Liggins.\n\nA double, ironic, meaning came to popular awareness in 1947 in blues artist Roy Brown's song \"Good Rocking Tonight\", covered in 1948 by Wynonie Harris in a wilder version, in which \"rocking\" was ostensibly about dancing but was in fact a thinly veiled allusion to sex. Such double-entendres were well established in blues music but were new to the radio airwaves. After the success of \"Good Rocking Tonight\", many other R&B artists used similar titles through the late 1940s. At least two different songs with the title \"Rock and Roll\" were recorded in the late 1940s: by Paul Bascomb in 1947 and Wild Bill Moore in 1948. In May 1948, Savoy Records advertised \"Robbie-Dobey Boogie\" by Brownie McGhee with the tagline \"It jumps, it's made, it rocks, it rolls.\" Another record where the phrase was repeated throughout the song was \"Rock and Roll Blues\", recorded in 1949 by Erline \"Rock and Roll\" Harris.\n\nThese songs were generally classed as \"race music\" or, from the late 1940s, \"rhythm and blues\", and were barely known by mainstream white audiences. However, in 1951, Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed began broadcasting rhythm, blues, and country music for a multi-racial audience. Freed, familiar with the music of earlier decades, used the phrase rock and roll to describe the music he aired over station WJW (850 AM); its use also is credited to Freed's sponsor, record store owner Leo Mintz, who encouraged Freed to play the music on the radio. Originally Freed used the name \"Moondog\" for himself and any concerts or promotions he put on because he used as his regular theme music a piece called \"Moondog Symphony\" by the street musician Louis \"Moondog\" Hardin. Hardin subsequently sued Freed on grounds that he was stealing his name, and because Freed was no longer allowed to use the term Moondog, he needed a new catchphrase. After a night of heavy drinking, he and his friends came up with the name \"The Rock and Roll Party\" because he already was using the phrase \"Rock and Roll Session\" to describe the music he was playing. As his show became extremely popular, the term became widely used to describe the style of music.\n\nRock and roll music emerged from the wide variety of musical genres that existed in the United States in the first half of the 20th century among different ethnic and social groups. Each genre developed over time through changing fashion and innovation, and each one exchanged ideas and stylistic elements with all the others. The greatest contribution came from the musical traditions of America's black population, with an ancient heritage of oral storytelling through music of African origin, usually with strong rhythmic elements, with frequent use of \"blue notes\" and often using a \"call and response\" vocal pattern. African music was modified through the experience of slavery, and through contact with white musical styles such as the folk ballad, and instruments, such as the Spanish guitar. New styles of music emerged among black Americans in the early 20th century in the form of blues, ragtime, jazz, and gospel music. According to the writer Robert Palmer:\"Rock 'n' roll was an inevitable outgrowth of the social and musical interactions between blacks and whites in the South and Southwest. Its roots are a complex tangle. Bedrock black church music influenced blues, rural blues influenced white folk song and the black popular music of the Northern ghettos, blues and black pop influenced jazz, and so on. But the single most important process was the influence of black music on white.\"\n\nBy the 1930s, African American musicians, such as Cab Calloway, Fletcher Henderson and Duke Ellington, were developing swing music, essentially jazz played for dancing, and in some areas such as New York City processes of social integration were taking place. According to Palmer, by the mid-1930s, elements of rock and roll could be found in every type of American folk and blues music. Some jazz bands, such as Count Basie's, increasingly played rhythmic music that was heavily based on blues riffs. In Chicago, blues performers formed into small groups, such as the Harlem Hamfats, and explored the use of amplification. In the Midwest, jump bands developed instrumental blues based on riffs, with saxophone solos and shouted vocals. In Nashville and elsewhere, country music played by white musicians such as Jimmie Rodgers incorporated blues styles, and in some cases was recorded with (uncredited) black musicians. In Texas and Oklahoma, Western swing bands, such as Bob Wills, combined elements of big band, blues and country music into a new style of dance music. As musicians from different areas and cultures heard each other's music, so styles merged and innovations spread. Increasingly, processes of active cross-fertilisation took place between the music played and heard by white people and the music predominantly played and heard by black people. These processes of exchange and mixing were fueled by the spread of radio, 78 rpm and later records and jukeboxes, and the expansion of the commercial popular music business. The music also benefited from the development of new amplification and electronic recording techniques from the 1930s onward, including the invention of the electric guitar, first recorded as a virtuoso instrument by Charlie Christian.\n\nIn 1938, promoter and record producer John H. Hammond staged the first \"From Spirituals to Swing\" concert in New York City to highlight black musical styles. It featured pianist Pete Johnson and singer Big Joe Turner, whose recording of \"Roll 'Em Pete\" helped spark a craze across American society for \"boogie woogie\" music, mostly played by black musicians. In both musical and social terms, this helped pave the way for rock and roll music. Economic changes also made the earlier big bands unwieldy; Louis Jordan left Chick Webb's orchestra the same year to form the Tympany Five. Mixing of genres continued through the shared experiences of the World War II, and afterward a new style of music emerged, featuring \"honking\" saxophone solos, increasing use of the electric guitar, and strongly accented boogie rhythms. This \"jump blues\" encompassed both novelty records, such as those by Jordan, and more heavily rhythmic recordings such as those by Lionel Hampton. \n\nIncreasingly, the term \"rocking\" was used in the records themselves, and by the late 1940s frequently was used to describe the music of performers such as Wynonie Harris whose records reached the top of the newly christened \"rhythm and blues\" charts.\n\nIn 1947, blues singer Roy Brown recorded \"Good Rocking Tonight\", a song that parodied church music by appropriating its references, including the word \"rocking\" and the gospel call \"Have you heard the news?\", relating them to very worldly lyrics about dancing, drinking and sex. The song became much more successful the following year when recorded by Wynonie Harris, whose version changed the steady blues rhythm to an uptempo gospel beat, and it was re-recorded by Elvis Presley in 1954 as his second single. A craze began in the rhythm and blues market for songs about \"rocking\", including \"We're Gonna Rock\" by Wild Bill Moore, the first commercially successful \"honking\" sax record, with the words \"We're gonna rock, we're gonna roll\" as a background chant. One of the most popular was \"Rock the Joint\", first recorded by Jimmy Preston in May 1949, and a R&B top 10 hit that year. Preston's version is often considered a prototype of a rock-and-roll song, and it was covered in 1952 by Bill Haley and the Saddlemen. Marshall Lytle, Haley's bass player, claimed that this was one of the songs that inspired Alan Freed to coin the phrase \"rock and roll\" to refer to the music he played.\n\nFreed first started playing the music in 1951, and by 1953 the phrase \"rock and roll\" was becoming used much more widely to market the music beyond its initial black audience. The practitioners of the music were young black artists, appealing to the post-war community's need for excitement, dancing and increasing social freedoms, but the music also became very attractive to white teenagers. As well as \"rocking\" rhythm and blues songs, such as the massively successful and influential \"Rocket 88\" recorded by Ike Turner and his band but credited to singer Jackie Brenston, the term was used to encompass other forms of black music. In particular, vocal harmony group recordings in the style that later became known as \"doo-wop\", such as \"Gee\" by the Crows and \"Earth Angel\" by the Penguins, became huge commercial successes, often for the new small independent record companies becoming established. These included Modern, Imperial, Specialty, Atlantic, King and Chess.\n\nThe adoption of rock and roll by white people was hindered by racist attitudes. As Billy Burnette said about his father Dorsey Burnette and uncle Johnny Burnette:They'd buy their clothes on Beale Street, at Lansky Brothers, where all the black people shopped. Right outside Memphis, there was a voodoo village, all black-real mystic kind of people... A lot of real old line southern people called my dad and my uncle white nigger. Nobody was doing rock-and-roll in those days except people they called white trash. When my dad and my uncle started doin' it, they were just about the first.\n\nAlthough some of the rhythm and blues musicians who had been successful in earlier years – such as Joe Turner, Ruth Brown, and Fats Domino who had his first R&B hit in 1950 – made the transition into new markets, much of the initial breakthrough into the wider pop music market came from white musicians, such as Haley, Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis, re-recording earlier rhythm and blues hits, often making use of technological improvements in recording and innovations such as double tracking, developed by the large mainstream record companies, as well as the invention of the 45-rpm record and the rapid growth of its use in jukeboxes. At the same time, younger black musicians such as Little Richard, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley took advantage of the gradual breakdown of ethnic barriers in America to become equally popular and help launch the rock and roll era. By the time of Haley's first hits in 1953, and those of Berry, Little Richard and then Presley the next year, rock and roll was firmly established.\nThe Pentecostal church has also been identified as a crucial component in the development of rock and roll. The modern Pentecostal movement parallels rock and roll in many ways. Further, the unhinged, wild energy of the church is evidenced in the most important of early rock performers that were also raised in Pentecostal churches, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Elvis Presley, Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe identity of the first rock and roll record is one of the most enduring subjects of debate among rock historians. Various recordings dating back to the 1940s and 1950s have been cited as the first rock and roll record. A number of sources have considered the first to be \"Rocket 88\", which was recorded in 1951 by Ike Turner and his band, but credited to his saxophonist and the song's vocalist Jackie Brenston. According to \"The Boston Globe\"s Joan Anderman, most rock historians cite it as the first, while \"The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll\" and the website of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame said that it is \"frequently cited\" and \"widely considered the first\", respectively. People in the music industry have also called it the first, among several others. \"Rocket 88\" is cited for its forceful backbeat and unrefined, distorted electric guitar. By contrast, writer and musician Michael Campbell wrote that, \"from our perspective,\" it was not the first rock and roll record because it had a shuffle beat rather than the rock rhythm originally characteristic in Chuck Berry's and Little Richard's songs, although he added that \"Rocket 88\" had basic characteristics of rock music such as the emphasis on guitar and distortion. Its characterization as a rock and roll or rhythm and blues song continues to be debated. Nigel Williamson questions whether it was really an R&B song \"with an unusually fast, bottom-heavy eight-to-the bar boogie rhythm and a great lyric about cars, booze and women\".\n\nThe music historian Robert Palmer wrote that Goree Carter's earlier 1949 song \"Rock Awhile\" is a \"much more appropriate candidate\" than \"the more frequently cited\" \"Rocket 88\", primarily because of the presence of loud electric guitar work on the former song. Palmer wrote that \"Rocket 88\" is credited for its raucous saxophone, boogie-woogie beat, fuzzy amplified guitar, and lyrics that celebrate the automobile. However, he regards \"Rock Awhile\" to be a more appropriate candidate for the \"first rock and roll record\" title, because it was recorded two years earlier, and because of Carter's guitar work bearing a striking resemblance to Chuck Berry's later guitar work, while making use of an over-driven amplifier, along with the backing of boogie-based rhythms, and the appropriate title and lyrical subject matter. Roger Wood and John Nova Lomax also have cited \"Rock Awhile\" as the first rock & roll record. Others have taken the view that the first was Roy Brown's \"Good Rocking Tonight\", or Wynonie Harris' 1948 version; the song received greater exposure when Elvis Presley covered it in 1954. Sister Rosetta Tharpe's 1944 song \"Strange Things Happening Every Day\" has also been viewed as among the first.\n\nMost rock historians have cited Bill Haley's 1953 song \"Crazy Man, Crazy\" as the first rock and roll record to reach the \"Billboard\" charts. Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\" released in 1954 was the first rock and roll record to achieve significant commercial success and was joined in 1955 by a number of other records that pioneered the genre. Along with \"Rock Around the Clock\", several rock critics also have pointed to Presley's \"That's All Right\" from 1954 as a candidate for the first rock and roll record.\n\nThe 1992 book \"What Was the First Rock'n'Roll Record?\" by Jim Dawson and Steve Propes discusses 50 contenders, from Illinois Jacquet's \"Blues, Part 2\" (1944) to Elvis Presley's \"Heartbreak Hotel\" (1956), without reaching a definitive conclusion. In their introduction, the authors claim that since the modern definition of rock 'n' roll was set by disc jockey Alan Freed's use of the term in his groundbreaking \"The Rock and Roll Show\" on New York's WINS in late 1954, as well as at his \"Rock and Roll Jubilee Balls\" at St. Nicholas Arena in January 1955, they chose to judge their candidates according to the music Freed spotlighted: R&B combos, black vocal groups, honking saxophonists, blues belters, and several white artists playing in the authentic R&B style (Bill Haley, Elvis Presley). The artists who appeared at Freed's earliest shows included orchestra leader Buddy Johnson, the Clovers, Fats Domino, Big Joe Turner, the Moonglows, Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters, and the Harptones. That, say Dawson and Propes, was the first music being called rock and roll during that short time when the term caught on all over America. Because the honking tenor saxophone was the driving force at those shows and on many of the records Freed was playing, the authors began their list with a 1944 squealing and squawking live performance by Illinois Jacquet with Jazz at the Philharmonic in Los Angeles in mid-1944. That record, \"Blues, Part 2,\" was released as Stinson 6024 and is still in print as a CD on the Verve label. Several notable jazz greats accompanied Jacquet on \"Blues\", including Paul Leslie and Slim Nadine (the monikers employed by Les Paul and Nat \"King\" Cole, respectively, in order to appear at the JATP concert incognito).\n\nIn 2004, Elvis Presley's \"That's All Right Mama\" and Bill Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\" both celebrated their 50th anniversaries. \"Rolling Stone\" felt that Presley's song was the first rock and roll recording. At the time, Presley recorded Big Joe Turner's \"Shake, Rattle & Roll\", later covered by Haley, was already at the top of the \"Billboard\" R&B charts. \"The Guardian\" felt that while there were rock and roll records before Presley's, his recording was the moment when all the strands came together in \"perfect embodiment\". Presley is quoted as saying: \"A lot of people seem to think I started this business, but rock and roll was here a long time before I came along.\"\n\nAlso formative in the sound of rock and roll were Little Richard and Chuck Berry. From the early 1950s, Little Richard combined gospel with New Orleans R&B, heavy backbeat, pounding piano and wailing vocals. Ray Charles referred to Little Richard as being the artist that started a new kind of music, which was a funky style of rock and roll that he was performing onstage for a few years before appearing on record in 1955 as \"Tutti Frutti.\" Chuck Berry, with \"Maybellene\" (recorded on May 21, 1955, and which reached # 1 on the R&B chart and no. 5 on the US pop chart), \"Roll over Beethoven\" (1956), \"Rock and Roll Music\" (1957) and \"Johnny B. Goode\" (1958), refined and developed the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, focusing on teen life and introducing guitar intros and lead breaks that would be a major influence on subsequent rock music. Early rock and roll used the twelve-bar blues chord progression and shared with boogie woogie the four beats (usually broken down into eight eighth-notes/quavers) to a bar. Rock and roll however has a greater emphasis on the backbeat than boogie woogie. Bo Diddley's 1955 hit \"Bo Diddley\", with its B-side \"I'm a Man\", introduced a new beat and unique guitar style that inspired many artists without either side using the 12-bar pattern – they instead played variations on a single chord each. His more insistent, driving rhythms, hard-edged electric guitar sound, African rhythms, and signature clave beat (a simple, five-accent rhythm), have remained cornerstones of rock and pop.\n\nOthers point out that performers like Arthur Crudup and Fats Domino were recording blues songs as early as 1946 that are indistinguishable from later rock and roll, and that these blues songs were based on themes, chord changes, and rhythms dating back decades before that. Wynonie Harris' 1947 cover of Roy Brown's \"Good Rocking Tonight\" is also a claimant for the title of first rock and roll record, as the popularity of this record led to many answer songs, mostly by black artists, with the same rocking beat, during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Big Joe Turner's 1939 recording \"Roll 'Em Pete\" is close to 1950s rock and roll. Sister Rosetta Tharpe also was recording shouting, stomping music in the 1930s and 1940s, such as \"Strange Things Happening Every Day\" (1944), that in some ways contained major elements of mid-1950s rock and roll. Pushing the date back even earlier, blues researcher Gayle Dean Wardlow has stated that \"Crazy About My Baby\" by Blind Roosevelt Graves and his brother, recorded in 1929, \"could be considered the first rock 'n' roll recording\".\n\nBy contrast, musician and writer Billy Vera argued that because rock and roll was \"an evolutionary process\", it would be foolish to name any single record as the first. Writer Nick Tosches similarly felt that, \"It is impossible to discern the first modern rock record, just as it is impossible to discern where blue becomes indigo in the spectrum.\" Music writer Rob Bowman remarked that the long-debated question is useless and cannot be answered because \"criteria vary depending upon who is making the selection.\"\n"}

Beck was a regular guest of the show; as were many other Golden Age of Comic Books creators who lived in the Orlando area.\n\nThe founders of OrlandoCon were regional chairman of the National Cartoonists Society Jim Ivey, and local enthusiasts Charlie Roberts, Richard Kravitz, Rob Word, and Neil Austin. Most OrlandoCons took place over a September weekend.\n\nEach year's show featured a banquet for attending cartoonists and the presentation to the guest of honor of a gold brick called the Ignatz Award named in honor of George Herriman's \"Krazy Kat\". Recipients of the Ignatz included Don Martin, Joe Kubert, Martin Nodell, and Don Addis. (The OrlandoCon Ignatz Award is not connected to the current award of the same name presented annually at the Bethesda, Maryland-based Small Press Expo.)\n\nEach show featured a charity auction to benefit the Milt Gross Fund of the National Cartoonists Society. The OrlandoCon often featured screenings of early TV shows, as well as panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals. In addition, there was a floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and collectibles merchants. The show included an autograph area, as well as an Artists' Alley where comics artists signed autographs and sold or produced free sketches.\n\nThe first OrlandoCon was held in September 1974 at the Orlando Howard Johnson's Convention Center — guests include C. C. Beck, Roy Crane, Hal Foster, Ron Goulart, , Les Turner, Ralph Dunagin, Bill Crooks, Harold McCauley, \"Scorchy Smith\" artist Edmund Good, and Disney artist Ralph Kent.\n\nIn 1976 OrlandoCon moved venues from the Howard Johnson Convention Center to the International Inn, where the convention stayed for most of the rest of its existence.\n\nEven though he moved to Pennsylvania in 1974, Charlie Roberts stayed with the OrlandoCon as co-organizer with Jim Ivey until 1979, at which point small press publisher Bill Black became involved with the convention.\n\nWith the collapse of the comic book speculating market in 1993, the show petered out.

The festival's co-founder and Artistic Director is Peter Robb, a composer and arranger of choral music as well as a conductor. The other co-founders are Genevieve Robb and Rebecca Robb Hicks. The gathering takes place each year in Eugene, Oregon, United States, in conjunction with the long-established Oregon Bach Festival.\n\nIn 2015 the name was changed to Pacific International Choral Festivals (picfest) in order to better identify the expansion from one festival to two festivals each season. With the slogan Longer season, shorter name, picfest announced a line-up of four distinct events. On even numbered years, the June event is now Youth Choral Festival (open to all voicings of young choirs up through age 18) and the new July event is the Young Women's Choral Festival (for female singers through age 18). On odd numbered years, picfest features the Treble Choral Festival in June and the newly renamed Sing Brothers Sing! Choral Festival in July (for male singers up through age 18).\n\npicfest is built on a non-competitive model. Each year ten -sixteen choirs are admitted through an audition process that takes into account the choir's history, repertoire, and recordings. Since inception, more than 180 choirs from 38 states and provinces in the United States, Canada, Australia, Finland, Taiwan and the Philippines have been selected and participated.\n\nChoirs and their chaperones are housed on the beautiful University of Oregon campus.\n\nThe collaboration between picfest and the Oregon Bach Festival usually results in a performance by the picfest Chorus at the opening ceremonies of the Oregon Bach Festival. In 2008, with the U.S. Olympic Track & Field Trials running concurrently with the festivals, the opening ceremonies performance took place on the performance venue at track's legendary Hayward Field. In 2011 and 2017, the Oregon Bach Festival had no official opening ceremony, and the entire picfest Chorus performed a free On-The-House concert.\n\npicfest presents one of the Oregon Bach Festival's On-The-House concerts in the Hult Center lobby during each festival. This concert features one or two of the visiting choirs or the entire festival chorus, as in 2011 and 2017. Attending choirs also perform individually at various local churches on the Sunday of the June Festival. Each festival concludes with a ticketed concert - the Gala Concert in June and the Finale Concert in July - performed by the Festival Chorus and guest musicians.\n\nEach year picfest features a guest conductor of international stature. Recent guest conductors have included Sandra Snow (2003, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2015), Bob Chilcott (2005, 2008, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018), Lynne Gackle (2010), Andrea Ramsey (2014, 2016) and Henry Leck (2001, 2006, 2013, 2017).\n\nBeginning in 2014, the season expanded to two festivals each summer. On even numbered years: Youth Choral Festival and Young Women's Choral Festival; and on odd numbered years: Treble Choral Festival and Boys & Young Men's Choral Festival. Scheduled for 2019 are Susan Brumfield (Treble Choral Festival) and Fernando Malvar-Ruiz (Sing Brothers Sing! Choral Festival). The 2020 season features Bob Chilcott (Youth Choral Festival) and Andrea Ramsey/Sandra Snow (Young Women's Choral Festival). \n\nThe repertoire of the festival chorus reflects a theme selected for each year, except for 2010 and 2012, which didn't have official themes:\n\n1998 - Our Voices Raised in Song\n\n1999 - Color the World with a Song\n\n2000 - Listen to the Future\n\n2001 - Roads to the Heart\n\n2002 - The World is Full of Poetry\n\n2003 - Dreams of Peace\n\n2004 - Imagine\n\n2005 - Walk • Dance • Talk • Sing\n\n2006 - Untraveled Worlds\n\n2007 - Celebrate!

He was a fugitive from 1996 until July 2008 after having been indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). The indictment concluded there were reasonable grounds for believing he committed war crimes, including genocide against Bosniak and Croat civilians during the Bosnian War (1992–95). While a fugitive, he worked at a private clinic in Belgrade, specialising in alternative medicine and psychology under an alias. His nephew, Dragan Karadžić, has claimed in an interview to the \"Corriere della Sera\" that Radovan Karadžić attended Serie A football matches and that he visited Venice using a different alias (Petar Glumac).\n\nHe was arrested in Belgrade on 21 July 2008 and brought before Belgrade's War Crimes Court a few days later. Extradited to the Netherlands, he is in the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the United Nations Detention Unit of Scheveningen, where he was charged with 11 counts of war crimes. He is sometimes referred to by the Western media as the \"Butcher of Bosnia\", a sobriquet also applied to former Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) General Ratko Mladić. On 24 March 2016, he was found guilty of the genocide in Srebrenica, war crimes and crimes against humanity, 10 of the 11 charges in total, and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment. On 22 July 2016 he filed an appeal against his conviction.\n\nRadovan Karadžić was born on 19 June 1945 in the village of Petnjica in the Socialist Republic of Montenegro, Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, near Šavnik. Karadžić's father, Vuko (1912–1987), was a cobbler from Petnjica. His mother, Jovanka ( Jakić; 1922–2005), was a peasant girl from Pljevlja. She married Karadžić's father in 1943, aged twenty. Karadžić claims to be related to the Serbian linguistic reformer Vuk Stefanović Karadžić (1787–1864), although this claim cannot be confirmed.\n\nHis father had been a Chetnik — the army of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia's government-in-exile during World War II—and was imprisoned by the post-war communist regime for much of his son's childhood. Karadžić moved to Sarajevo in 1960 to study psychiatry at the Sarajevo University School of Medicine.\n\nKaradžić studied neurotic disorders and depression at Næstved Hospital in Denmark in 1970, and during 1974-1975 he underwent further medical training at Columbia University in New York. After his return to Yugoslavia, he worked in the Koševo Hospital in Sarajevo. He was also a poet, influenced by Serbian writer Dobrica Ćosić, who encouraged him to go into politics. During his spell as an ecologist, he declared that \"Bolshevism is bad, but nationalism is even worse\".\n\nSoon after graduation, Karadžić started working in a treatment centre at the psychiatric clinic of the main Sarajevo hospital, Koševo. According to testimony, he often boosted his income by issuing fake medical and psychological evaluations to healthcare workers who wanted early retirement or to criminals who tried to avoid punishment by pleading insanity. In 1983, Karadžić started working at a hospital in the Belgrade suburb of Voždovac. With his partner Momčilo Krajišnik, then manager of a mining enterprise \"Energoinvest\", he managed to get a loan from an agricultural-development fund and they used it to build themselves houses in Pale, a Serb town above Sarajevo turned into a ski resort by the government.\n\nOn 1 November 1984 the two were arrested for fraud and spent 11 months in detention before their friend Nikola Koljević managed to bail them out. Due to a lack of evidence, Karadžić was released and his trial was brought to a halt. The trial was revived and on 26 September 1985 Karadžić was sentenced to three years in prison for embezzlement and fraud. As he had already spent over a year in detention, Karadžić did not serve the remaining sentence in prison.\n\nFollowing encouragement from Dobrica Ćosić, later the first president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and Jovan Rašković, leader of the Croatian Serbs, he cofounded the Serb Democratic Party () in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1989. The party aimed at unifying the Republic's Bosnian Serb community and joining Croatian Serbs in leading them in remaining as part of Yugoslavia in the event of secession by those two republics from the federation.\n\nThroughout September 1991, the SDS began to establish various \"Serb Autonomous Regions\" throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. After the Bosnian parliament voted on sovereignty on 15 October 1991, a separate Serb Assembly was founded on 24 October 1991 in Banja Luka, to exclusively represent the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The following month, Bosnian Serbs held a referendum which resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of staying in a federal state with Serbia and Montenegro, as part of Yugoslavia. In December 1991, a top secret document, \"For the organisation and activity of organs of the Serbs people in Bosnia-Herzegovina in extraordinary circumstances\", was drawn up by the SDS leadership. This was a centralised programme for the takeover of each municipality in the country, through the creation of shadow governments and para-governmental structures through various \"crisis headquarters\", and by preparing loyalist Serbs for the takeover in co-ordination with the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA).\n\nOn 9 January 1992, the Bosnian Serb Assembly proclaimed the Republic of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Република српског народа Босне и Херцеговине/Republika srpskog naroda Bosne i Hercegovine). On 28 February 1992, the constitution of the Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was adopted. It declared that the state's territory included Serb autonomous regions, municipalities, and other Serbian ethnic entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as \"all regions in which the Serbian people represent a minority due to the Second World War genocide\" (although how this was established was never specified), and that it was to be a part of the federal Yugoslav state. On 29 February and 1 March 1992 a referendum on the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Yugoslavia was held. Many Serbs boycotted the referendum and pro-independence Bosniaks (Muslims) and Croats turned out.\n\nOn 6 and 7 April 1992, Bosnia was recognized as an independent state by the European Community and the US. It was admitted to the UN on 22 May 1992. \n\nKaradžić was voted President of Republika Srpska, the Bosnian Serb administration, in Pale on about 13 May 1992 after the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At the time he assumed this position, his \"de jure\" powers, as described in the constitution of the Bosnian Serb administration, included commanding the army of the Bosnian Serb administration in times of war and peace, and having the authority to appoint, promote and discharge officers of the army. Karadžić made three trips to the UN in New York in February and March 1993 for negotiations on the future of Bosnia.\n\nHe went to Moscow in 1994 for meetings with Russian officials on the Bosnian situation. In 1994, the Greek Orthodox Church declared Karadžić \"one of the most prominent sons of our Lord Jesus Christ working for peace\", and decorated him with the nine-hundred-year-old Knights' Order of the First Rank of Saint Dionysius of Xanthe. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew announced that \"the Serbian people have been chosen by God to protect the western frontiers of Orthodoxy\".\n\nOn Friday 4 August 1995, with a massive Croatian military force poised to attack the Serb-held Krajina region in central Croatia, Karadžić announced he was removing General Ratko Mladić from his commandant post and assuming personal command of the VRS himself. Karadžić blamed Mladić for the loss of two key Serb-held towns in western Bosnia that had recently fallen to the Croats, and he used the loss of the towns as the excuse to announce his surprise command structure changes. General Mladić was demoted to an \"adviser\". Mladić refused to go quietly, claiming the support of the Bosnian Serb military and the people. Karadžić countered by attempting to pull political rank as well as denouncing Mladić as a \"madman\", but Mladić's popular support forced Karadžić to rescind his order on 11 August.\n\nKaradžić was accused by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) of personal and command responsibility for numerous war crimes committed against non-Serbs, in his roles as Supreme Commander of the Bosnian Serb armed forces and President of the National Security Council of the Republika Srpska. He was accused by the same authority of being responsible for the deaths of more than 7,500 Bosniaks (Muslims). Under his direction and command, Bosnian Serb forces initiated the Siege of Sarajevo. He was accused by the ICTY of ordering the Srebrenica genocide in 1995, directing Bosnian Serb forces to \"create an unbearable situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival of life\" in the UN safe area. He was also accused by the ICTY of ordering that United Nations personnel be taken hostage in May–June 1995.\n\nHe was jointly indicted by the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in 1995, along with General Ratko Mladić. The indictment charged Karadžić on the basis of his individual criminal responsibility (Article 7(1) of the Statute) and superior criminal responsibility (Article 7(3) of the Statute) with:\n\nThe United States government offered a $5 million reward for his and Ratko Mladić's arrests.\n\nAuthorities missed arresting Karadžić in 1995 when he was an invitee of the United Nations. During his visit to the United Nations in 1993, he was handed a service of process for a civil claim under the United States of America Code of Laws Alien Tort Act. The Courts ruled that Karadžić was properly served and the trial was allowed to proceed in United States District Court.\nKaradžić's ability to evade capture for over a decade increased his esteem among some Bosnian Serbs, despite an alleged deal with Richard Holbrooke. Some sources allege that he received protection from the United States as a consequence of the Dayton Agreement. Holbrooke, however, repeatedly denied that such a deal was ever made.\n\nDuring his time as fugitive he was helped by several people, including Bosko Radonjich and in 2001, hundreds of supporters demonstrated in support of Karadžić in his home town. In March 2003, his mother Jovanka publicly urged him to surrender.\n\nBritish officials conceded military action was unlikely to be successful in bringing Karadžić and other suspects to trial, and that putting political pressure on Balkan governments would be more likely to succeed.\n\nIn May 2004, the UN learned that: \"the brother of a war crimes suspect allegedly in the process of providing information on Radovan Karadzic and his network to the ICTY, was mistakenly killed in a raid by the Republika Srpska police\" and added that \"It is being argued that the informer was targeted in order to silence him before he was able to say more.\"\n\nIn 2005, Bosnian Serb leaders called on Karadžić to surrender, stating that Bosnia and Serbia could not move ahead economically or politically while he remained at large. After a failed raid earlier in May, on 7 July 2005 NATO troops arrested Karadžić's son, Aleksandar, but released him after 10 days. On 28 July, Karadžić's wife, Ljiljana, made a call for him to surrender after, what she called, \"enormous pressure\".\n\nThe BBC reported that Karadžić had been sighted in 2005 near Foča: \"38 km (24 miles) down the road, on the edge of the Sutjeska national park, Radovan Karadžić has just got out of a red Mercedes\" and asserted that \"Western intelligence agencies knew roughly where they were, but that there was no political will in London or Washington to risk the lives of British, or U.S. agents, in a bid to seize\" him and Mladić.\n\nOn 10 January 2008, the BBC reported that the passports of his closest relatives had been seized. On 21 February 2008, at the time Kosovo declared independence, portraits of Karadžić were on display during Belgrade's \"Kosovo is Serbia protest\".\n\nSince 1999 Karadžić had been masquerading as a \"new age\" expert in alternative medicine using the fake name \"D.D. David\" printed on his business cards. The initials apparently stood for \"Dragan Dabić\"; officials said he was also using the name \"Dr. Dragan David Dabić\". He lectured in front of hundreds of people on alternative medicine. He had his own website, where he offered his assistance in the treatment of sexual problems and disorders by using what he called \"Human Quantum Energy\".\n\nThere were reports that Karadžić evaded capture in May 2007 in Vienna, where he lived under the name Petar Glumac, posing as a Croatian seller of herbal solutions and ointments. Austrian police talked to him during the raid regarding an unrelated homicide case in the area where Karadžić lived but failed to recognize his real identity. He had obtained a Croatian passport in the name of Petar Glumac and claimed to be in Vienna for training. The police did not ask any further questions nor demanded to fingerprint him as he appeared calm and readily answered questions. Nevertheless, this claim came into doubt when a man named Petar Glumac, an alternative medical practitioner from Banatsko Novo Selo, Serbia, claims to have been the person the police talked with in Vienna. Glumac reportedly bears a striking resemblance to Karadžić's appearance as Dragan Dabić. Dragan Karadžić, his nephew, claimed in an interview to the \"Corriere della Sera\" that Karadžić attended football matches of Serie A and visited Venice under the name of Petar Glumac.\n\nThe arrest of Radovan Karadžić took place on 21 July 2008 in Belgrade. He was in hiding, posing as a doctor of alternative medicine mostly in Belgrade but also in Vienna, Austria. Karadžić was transferred into ICTY custody in the Hague on 30 July. Karadžić appeared before judge Alphons Orie on 31 July, in the tribunal, which has sentenced 64 accused since 1993. During the first hearing Radovan Karadžić expressed a fear for his life by saying: \"If Holbrooke wants my death and regrets there is no death sentence at this court, I want to know if his arm is long enough to reach me here.\" and stated that the deal he made with Richard Holbrooke is the reason why it took 13 years for him to appear in front of the ICTY. He made similar accusations against the former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Muhamed Sacirbey, Bosnian foreign minister at the time, claimed that a Karadžić-Holbrooke deal was made in July 1996.\n\nIn August 2008 Karadžić claimed there is a conspiracy against him and refused to enter a plea, whereupon the court entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf to all 11 charges. He called the tribunal, chaired by Scottish judge Iain Bonomy, a \"court of NATO\" disguised as a court of the international community.\n\nOn 13 October 2009, the BBC reported that Karadžić's plea to be granted immunity from his charges was denied. However, the start of his trial was moved to 26 October so he could prepare a defense.\n\nOn Monday 26 October 2009 Karadžić's trial was suspended after 15 minutes after he carried out his threat to boycott the start of the hearing. Judge O-Gon Kwon said that in the absence of Karadžić, who was defending himself, or any lawyer representing him, he was suspending the case for 24 hours, when the prosecution would begin its opening statement. On 5 November 2009, the court imposed a lawyer on him, and postponed his trial until 1 March 2010.\n\nOn 26 November 2009, Karadžić filed a motion challenging the legal validity and legitimacy of the tribunal, claiming that \"the UN Security Council lacked the power to establish the ICTY, violated agreements under international law in so doing, and delegated non-existent legislative powers to the ICTY\", to which the Prosecution response was that \"The Appeals Chamber has already determined the validity of the Tribunal’s creation in previous decisions which constitute established precedent on this issue\", therefore dismissing the Motion. The prosecution started its case on 13 April 2010, and completed it on 25 May 2012. The discovery of more than 300 previously unknown bodies in a mass grave at the Tomasica mine near Prijedor in September 2013 caused a flurry of motions which ended with the court denying reopening prosecutorial evidence. The defence began its case on 16 October 2012 and completed it in March 2014; Karadžić decided not to testify. Closing arguments in the case began on 29 September 2014 and were concluded on 7 October 2014, Karadžić having failed in his demand for a re-trial.\n\nKaradžić and Mladić were placed on trial for charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Srebrenica, Prijedor, Ključ, and other districts of Bosnia. They were charged, separately, with:\n\n\nThe Yugoslav war crimes court rejected on 27 June 2012 one of the two genocide charges against Karadžić. However, on 11 July 2013, the Appeals Chamber reinstated these charges.\n\nOn 24 March 2016 he was found guilty of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and sentenced to 40 years imprisonment. He was found guilty of genocide for the Srebrenica massacre, which aimed to kill \"every able-bodied male\" in the town and systematically exterminate the Bosnian Muslim community. He was also convicted of persecution, extermination, deportation, forcible transfer (ethnic cleansing), and murder in connection with his campaign to drive Bosnian Muslims and Croats out of villages claimed by Serb forces.\n\nOn 27 February 2018 it was announced by the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals that hearings for the appeal against the conviction were set on 23 April 2018.\n\nKaradžić published several books of poetry, many of which were published whilst in hiding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The violence was part of the wider early insurgency phase of the Syrian Civil War. Large pro-government and anti-government protests took place in the suburbs and center of Damascus, with the situation escalating when members of the Free Syrian Army started attacking military targets in November.\n\nIt is claimed that in January 2012, parts of rural Damascus and the Damascus suburbs started to fall under opposition control. On 27 January 2012, the Syrian Army launched a military operation which retook the Damascus suburbs and the town of Zabadani with the offensive ending on 11 February. However, fighting still continued, when on 15 February FSA fighters were seen on the streets of a district in the Damascus centre, trying to recruit and mingling with opposition protesters. A few anti-government protests were still ongoing after the army offensive.\n\nOn 12 March 2012, major clashes were reported in central Damascus between the FSA and the Syrian Army for the first time. By April 2012 a fragile cease-fire was brokered by the UN peace envoy Kofi Annan. However, following the cease fire collapse, by July 2012, rebels erupted again into most Damascus suburbs and rural areas around the city, launching the Battle of Damascus, also known as Operation Damascus Volcano.\n\nLarge anti-government protests were shot at by \"Shabiba\", killing 23 protesters in a single day. More were killed in October and November. Ten more protesters were killed around Damascus, including a 14-year-old boy.\n\nFourteen were killed in house-to-house raids and in protests in Damascus suburbs, and an activist in the eastern Damascus suburb of Harasta, who gave his name as Assem, said three deserters were killed after they abandoned military units which fired live ammunition at a demonstration of 1,500–2,000 people in the al-Zar neighbourhood. \"Security police could not put down the demonstration. The eight soldiers defected when Republican Guards and the Fourth Armoured Division were sent in,\" he said.\n\nOn 16 November 2011, according to opposition sources, Syrian army deserters attacked a military intelligence office in Harasta, a suburb of the capital Damascus, killing six soldiers and wounding more than 20. \"The Syrian Free Army struck with rockets and RPGs\" said Omar Idlibi, the Beirut-based spokesperson for the opposition Syrian Local Co-ordination Committees. It was also said that all the army defectors involved returned after the attack. All other attacks targeted military checkpoints in the suburbs of Douma, Qaboun and Arabeen and Saqba, killing three soldiers. A Russian official said that the outbreak of fighting in Damascus \"looks like a civil war.\"\n\nOn 20 November 2011, a loud explosion was reported to have occurred in the heart of Damascus, the Syrian capital, amid reports of a grenade attack on offices of the ruling Baath Party, the boldest attack by army defectors at the time.\nThe Free Syrian Army later claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they fired two rocket-propelled grenades at the building.\n\nIn December 2011, Al Jazeera published an article; that protesters in the suburbs of Damascus did gather every evening to make their support for the Free Syrian Army known. Seeing though that this disinformation did not bring anyone on the streets, the article was later changed into.\n\nOn 4 December 2011, the SANA news agency reported that a funeral procession was held on Sunday for 13 soldiers who were killed. It claimed that killed while they were in the line of duty in Damascus countryside.\n\nOn 9 December 2011, two children, aged 10 and 12, were among others killed by Syrian security forces on Friday in Homs and on the outskirts of Damascus, rights groups said. On 13 December, another person died.\n\nOn 23 December 2011, Syrian state TV claimed that two explosions at security bases in Damascus were caused by suicide bombers; a number of military personnel and civilians were killed. At least 44 people were reported killed and 55 others wounded. State television claimed that \"several soldiers and a large number of civilians\" had been killed in the bombings although an exact figure was hard to ascertain.\n\nOn 29 December 2011, Syrian security forces opened fire on tens of thousands protesting outside a mosque in a Damascus suburb called Douma, close to a municipal building that members of the Arab League monitoring mission were believed to be visiting. At least four protesters died. Rami Abdul-Rahman, head of his one-man British-based \"Syrian Observatory for Human Rights\", said about 20,000 people were protesting outside the Grand Mosque in Douma when troops opened fire. Cars belonging to the Arab League monitors were seen in front of a municipal building close to the mosque, he said. Abdul-Rahman and other activists said the monitors were barred by security officials from entering Douma following the killings, after the situation deteriorated.\n\nOn 4 January 2012, a journalist and a host on state-owned Radio Damascus and an editor with the state-owned daily Al-Thawra, was shot in the head by unidentified gunmen on Friday in his home in the Damascus suburb of Darya. State television reported that the journalist was targeted by \"armed terrorist groups.\"\n\nOn 6 January 2012, SANA claimed that another suicide bomber killed at least 26 when a police building or intelligence building was attacked. However, the opposition pointed the finger at the Government, saying \"this is a plot staged by the government to deter thousands of people that were planning to converge on that same spot to call for the international community to step in and enforce a no-fly zone and enforce also a dramatic end to the regime\". Later SANA reported the death of General Mohammed Abdul-Hamid al-Awwad, claiming he was assassinated while he was headed for work in the al-Ghouta area of Damascus. His driver, who was injured, said that \"As we were heading to the Brigadier General's military unit, we saw a taxi on the right of the road…it overtook us and then blocked our way. Four gunmen started shooting at us. Brigadier al-Awwad was shot in the head and I was also injured.\"\n\nOn 7 January 2012, 14 protesters were said to have died though a roadside bomb blast and anti-government protests on the same day.\n\nOn 12 January 2012, state TV reported that an army bus was attacked in the area of the Damascus countryside with another roadside bomb and gunfire, killing four soldiers and wounding eight. Six more soldiers (including a colonel) were killed in battles around the province, according to the Syrian government.\n\nOn 19 January 2012, a Syrian security officer was killed after the bombing of his car in al-Tadhamun neighborhood in Damascus.\n\nOn 22 January 2012, amidst a battle in the surbub of Douma two officers and a soldier of the Syrian Army and a deserter was killed in the Talfita area.\n\nRural Damascus came under rebel control. At the police hospital in Harasta, the staff said most of rural Damascus was not controlled by the government forces and gunmen were kidnapping and killing those affiliated with the government in those areas. \"Any car plate that belongs to the government cannot drive inside Harasta, we as doctors cannot go, they hijacked one of our cars a week ago,\" said a doctor.\n\nAccording to the Syrian Government, Brigadier General Hassan Abdullah al-Ibrahim and a First Lieutenant were killed when their car was fired on in the Damascus countryside.\n\nOn 27 January 2012, the Syrian army stormed Douma.\n\nOn 28 January 2012, seven more soldiers died around Damascus amidst the offensive. They were ambushed. Later SANA reported that the bus was ambushed near Douma, and it was carrying army officers, in which seven of the officers died.\n\nOn 29 January 2012, the Syrian army launched an offensive, trying to retake some of the Damascus suburbs from rebel control. Amateur video appeared to show tanks rolling in to Al-Ghouta and Zamalka to the east. Al-Ghouta is historically known for being a hub of dissent against the Assad government, and the crackdown appeared to be an attempt \"to avoid any Tahrir Square-style mass movements,\". According to activists, 14 civilians and 5 opposition fighters were killed in shelling of neighbourhoods. 2,000 pro-assad forces and 50 tanks and armoured vehicles took part in the offensive. However, they met fierce resistance and six government soldiers, including two officers, were killed and six wounded in the opposition controlled suburb of Sahnaya when their bus was blown up by a remote-controlled bomb. Some activists claimed that the fighting in Damascus was not unusual, and there wasn't any tanks in the city, while others said that it was \"the worst fighting around the capital in the 10-month uprising.\" Clashes were also reported near Damascus airport, leading to its closure. \"It’s urban war. There are bodies in the street,\" one activist, speaking from Kfar Batna told Reuters. \nOther Damascus suburbs that have come under fire from heavy artillery and mortar rounds from government forces include Douma, Saaba, Arbin and Hamuriyeh, activists said. \"The more the regime uses the army, the more soldiers defect,\" Ahmed al-Khatib, a local rebel council member on the Damascus outskirts, told the AFP news agency. A spokesperson for the rebel FSA, which at the time, had 40,000 men and whose leadership was in Turkey, said that the fighting came a day after \"a large wave of defections,\" with 50 officers and soldiers turning their back on Assad. At least two generals and other \"high-ranking officers\" reportedly defected to the opposition.\n\nAfter two days of clashes, oppositions and FSA sources confirmed that the Syrian army gained back control of some of the eastern suburbs of Damascus from the rebels and started to make house to house checks and arrests. Hamouriyeh was taken by the Syrian government, as was Kfar Batna by the end of the clashes. FSA and government forces still fought in the suburb of Saqba, according to an activist. However, the Free Syrian army regained control of at least one suburb, Douma, and destroyed one tank and also killing three government snipers. Another 11 soldiers had been killed in the government offensive on the Al-Ghouta suburb, as well as six civilians.\n\nOn 30 January 2012, the fighting subsided as Syrian army extanded their control in Ghouta. The military also advanced through Saqba. An activist said that the FSA moved out of the suburbs and that the Syrian army arrested 200 opposition members in Hammourya. The death toll given by activists was 19 civilians and 6 FSA fighters, while the overall number of those killed in the previous three days, since the fighting in the area started, was 100. After the fighting, the Free Syrian Army withdrew to unidentified positions within 10 kilometers of Damascus.\n\nOn 31 January 2012, the Syrian army continued to advance in order to crush the last FSA pockets. The army fired into the air, as they advanced with tanks even beyond the positions from where the FSA withdrew. Activists told that the suburbs were on unannounced curfew while others were allowed to flee. The army was conducting arrests on suspected people in the district of Irbin. In some instances, curfews were defied by some citizens, who put up a large opposition flag in the centre of Damascus.\n\nOn 1 February 2012, the Syrian army extended their cleaning operations, with more troops moving into the mountainous area of Qalamoun, north of Damascus. Further north, the troops which took the control of Rankous, started to extend their control into farmland surrounding the city. In the eastern suburbs of Mesraba, activist reported that army snipers were positioned and that tanks were in the streets. In fighting in Wadi Barada, located north-west of Damascus in the Rif Damashk governorate, the Local Committee of Coordination initially reported that 12 people, including six FSA fighter, were killed. Four of those died during a tank bombardment by the military in an attempt to flush out the Free Syrian Army units operating in the area. A rebel spokesman put the death toll at 15. Later, the death toll of FSA fighters in the area was raised to 14 by the activist group. The opposition activist group also wrongly stated that the government poisoned the water supply of Wadi Barada, however, there was no independent confirmation and no other media reported the claim. One other FSA fighter was reportedly killed in fighting in the suburb of Moadhamieh. The town of Deir Kanoun and Ein al Fija were also under army assaults according to the London-based SOHR. Syria's state news agency SANA said a general, Rajeh Mahmoud, was killed along with three other soldiers on the outskirts of Damascus.\n\nIn Saqba, a working-class eastern suburb city of Damascus, had in-midst a peaceful anti-government demonstrations shortly fallen into control of a dozen armed and masked fighters from the Free Syria Army (FSA). FSA also tried to resist against retaking by the Syrian army, but was later purged. And the fighting had stopped after the soldiers cleared the area street by street. Checkpoints were manned at main intersections and FSA fighters had either fled or been killed or wounded in the fighting. Damages were visible in the streets. Bodies of killed civilians where found severely mutilated, some had their hands bound. A resident told that he saw tanks firing into shops and talked about Iranian and Hezbollah involvement while there was no other evidence of that. Some others vowed to continue to protest once the soldiers would have left.

It opened in 1945 and currently has 246 beds with an acute care facility and has become a regional medical center serving far Northern California. It is also the first fully accredited chest pain center in northern California.\n\nIt was purchased by Tenet Healthcare Corporation in 1976 and renamed Redding Medical Center. In 2002, amid a federal investigation of two cardiologists at the hospital, Drs. Chae Hyun Moon and Fidel Realyvasquez, and as part of a settlement with federal regulators, Tenet Healthcare Corporation was compelled to sell the hospital to Hospital Partners of America for $60 million USD in 2004. Hospital Partners of America then renamed the hospital to its current name of Shasta Regional Medical Center and took measures to ensure that this incident would not occur in the future.\n\nHospital Partners of America went into bankruptcy in 2008, and the hospital operations were taken over by Prime Healthcare Services.\n\nShasta Regional is the only hospital in Shasta County certified as a Chest Pain Center and became a Primary Stroke Center for the region in 2006. It was the first hospital in California and 11th in the nation to be certified as an Advanced Inpatient Diabetes Care hospital in 2010 by The Joint Commission.\n\nThe hospital was named as a \"Top Performer on Key Quality Measures\" by The Joint Commission based on care and patient outcomes for Heart Attack, Heart Failure, Pneumonia and Surgical Care in 2010.\n\nAt Redding Medical Center, the early-2000s investigation, raid and litigation were prompted because \"physicians undertook large volumes of inappropriate and unnecessary procedures on largely healthy patients\". The investigation into Moon and Realyvasquez was the result of multiple whistleblower lawsuits filed under the Federal False Claims Act alleging unnecessary medical procedures. Catholic Priest John Corapi, Joseph Zerga and Redding physician Patrick Campbell split 15% of the total $62.55 million settlement.\n\nTenet had already agreed to pay $54 million in 2003 to settle the federal case without admitting any wrongdoing but with an agreement for new oversight procedures for physicians and staff. In 2004, Tenet established a $395 million fund for 769 cardiac patients to settle civil suits relating to procedures performed by Moon and Realyvasquez.\n\nThere is also evidence that Prime Healthcare Services engages in upcoding elderly patients to malnutrition. At Shasta Regional Medical Center, Prime reported 16.1% of their Medicare patients suffered from kwashiorkor. The state of California average for Medicare patients is 0.2% suffering from kwashiorkor. Prime Healthcare Services is currently being investigated for Medicare fraud by United States Department of Health and Human Services and the California Department of Justice.\n\n"}

Whereas states of affairs (situations) either \"obtain\" or \"fail-to-obtain\", propositions are either \"true\" or \"false\". \n\nDavid Malet Armstrong is well known for his defence of a factualism, a position according to which the world is a world of facts and not a world of things.\n\nIn a sense of \"state of affairs\" favored by Ernest Sosa, states of affairs are situational conditions. In fact, in the \"Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy\", Sosa defines a condition to be a state of affairs, \"way things are\" or situation—most commonly referred to by a nominalization of a sentence. The expression \"Snow's being white\", which refers to the condition snow's being white, is a nominalization of the sentence \"Snow is white\". \"The truth of the proposition that \"snow is white\" is a nominalization of the sentence \"the proposition that snow is white is true\". Snow's being white is a necessary and sufficient condition for the truth of the proposition that snow is white. Conditions in this sense may be called situational.\n\nUsually, necessity and sufficiency relate conditions of the same kind. Being an animal is a necessary attributive condition for being a dog. Fido's being an animal is a necessary situational condition for Fido's being a dog.\n\n\n"}

The special first aired February 19, 1975 on CBS, and was the last Dr. Seuss special produced for that network. Seuss also composed the song lyrics, which were set to music by Dean Elliott. \n\nMr. Hoober-Bloob, a dispatcher of newborn children from some location in space, is preparing to send a new child down his highway to Earth, but first, he gives the child a chance to decide for himself whether he wants the life of a human. Mr. Hoober-Bloob shows him the realistic problems and pleasures that people face in life. The story suggests that while things may be pretty bad, there's always something to be thankful for.\n\nThe titular highway is a long and winding road that leads to Earth from an area high up in space where newborn babies come from. The plot revolves around a newborn child, referred to as \"Bub\", as he tries to decide what he wants out of its life, or even if he wants to go at all, before being sent down the Hoober-Bloob Highway to be born.\n\nMr. Hoober-Bloob, with the help of a lute with arms and legs that often breaks into fast-paced solos (which annoys Mr. Hoober-Bloob), explains to the child what to expect in human life. His explanations are often accompanied by musical vignettes of the baby, depicted as a pre-adolescent boy, in an unusual situation that accompanies the song (such as being placed in front of a long and quickly scrolling tape with checkboxes on it and being expected to check the boxes quickly in the \"Answer Yes or No\" segment). Eventually, the baby makes the decision to depart for the world below, and Mr. Hoober-Bloob excitedly pushes his carriage down the Hoober-Bloob Highway at last.\n\n\n\n\"The Hoober-Bloob Highway\" was nominated for a Primetime Emmy, but it lost out to \"Yes, Virginia, There Is a Santa Claus\". It is one of the lesser-known Dr. Seuss animated specials, having not been a book adaptation. It was given limited release on VHS, and can also be found alongside the VHS release of \"The Cat in the Hat\" and the VHS and DVD releases of \"The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat\". It is also included as a bonus special on the Blu-ray release of \"The Cat in the Hat\".\n\nIt was also broadcast on ABC Family's 25 Days of Christmas on December 1, 2008.\n\n\"The Hoober-Bloob Highway\" features a number of songs, centered on the decisions the newborn must make about his future life. All the lyrics are written by Dr. Seuss, all music by Dean Elliott.\n\nThe soundtrack was referenced by rapper Danny! through a track titled \"This Is Your Life (In West Watch-A-Ka-Tella) (instrumental)\" off of his album \"Where Is Danny?\" The Japanese version of this record, released via Interscope Records, replaces the aforementioned track with another instrumental titled \"...And That's the Way It Is, Bub\", also in reference to the soundtrack.\n"}
{"id": "39438601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39438601", "title": "The Route of the K-Money", "text": "The Route of the K-Money\n\nThe Route of the K-Money (; \"K\" stands for \"Kirchnerism\") was a 2013 political scandal in Argentina. It began with reports on the \"Periodismo para todos\" television program on the results of its investigation, led by journalist Jorge Lanata. Embezzlement and an associated money trail involved Argentine presidents Néstor Kirchner, Cristina de Kirchner and their employee, businessman Lázaro Báez. The investigation concluded that Báez diverted money intended for public infrastructure to tax havens. The scandal led to an official investigation. To date no judicial investigation ever found any proof of wrongdoing by Néstor Kirchner or Cristina de Kirchner. However, in April 2016 Lázaro Baez was awaiting trial on corruption charges in an Argentinian federal prison.\n\n\"Periodismo para todos\" began its 2013 season on April 14. Jorge Lanata reported that according to the tax return Néstor Kirchner sent to the AFIP, the Argentine revenue-collection agency, he and wife Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had personal wealth of US$1.4 million when he became president in 2003. She was elected president four years later; when Néstor Kirchner died in 2010, their assets were US$14.1 million. Lanata said that there was also a large amount of undeclared money.\n\nThe first program included interviews with Leonardo Fariña and Federico Elaskar, who detailed methods used by Lázaro Báez to send €55 million to tax havens. Báez, a businessman from Santa Cruz Province, was a close friend of Néstor Kirchner. Fariña worked for Báez, and Elaskar headed SGI (a financial firm used for money laundering). Elaskar detailed operations at La Rosadita, a firm in the Madero Center building in Puerto Madero. La Rosadita channeled money from Santa Cruz to Uruguay and Uruguay to Switzerland, in €1.5-million increments via shell corporations. Elaskar revealed more than 50 financial firms used for similar transactions; the operation required collaboration by banks as well. Fabián Rossi, husband of actress Iliana Calabró, was accused of managing financial operations in Panama.\n\nFariña and Elaskar later recanted their statements. Fariña said on the TV program \"Intrusos en el espectáculo\" that he knew that he was being filmed, he lied to Lanata and he never carried bags of money. Elaskar said that he lied to harm Fariña. Gossip shows on state-sponsored TV channels called it the \"Fariña-Rossi case\", focusing on the impact on the television personalities, ignoring ties to Báez and Kirchner and downplaying the corruption charges. Rossi said that Fariña and Elaskar were deluded.\n\nEduardo Arnold, vice-governor of Santa Cruz during Néstor Kirchner's presidency, said on the TV program \"La cornisa\" that in 2001 Cristina Kirchner showed him a vault in her home in El Calafate for the family's savings; Arnold suspected that the vault, larger than a home safe, confirmed the alleged money laundering.\n\nIn later programs, Lanata presented more evidence for the allegations. The second episode focused on the relationship between Báez and the Kirchners. Lanata documented agreements between Báez and Néstor Kirchner authorizing a builder, Austral Construcciones (owned by Báez), to build apartments on land owned by Kirchner. These documents had already been sent to the courts by deputy Elisa Carrió, who alleged illegal collaboration by Báez, Kirchner and minister Julio de Vido. Lanata also detailed unusual growth in Báez's finances since the beginning of the Kirchner presidencies, and favoritism toward Austral Construcciones in the awarding of the majority of public contracts in the province. According to the Swiss bank Teegan, a shell corporation wholly owned by Lázaro Báez's son Martín, transferred $1.5 million . Jorge Harguindeguy, former Argentine ambassador to Panama, confirmed the Panamanian operations of La Rosadita. Travel records obtained by \"La Nación\" indicate that Fariña, Rossi, Martín Báez and Daniel Pérez Gadín (Báez's accountant) all visited Panama, often at the same time. Fariña flew from Uruguay to Panama on the official plane of Chaco Province, governed by Kirchner supporter Jorge Capitanich.\n\nOn April 28, Lanata detailed links between minister Julio de Vido, Kirchner and Báez. De Vido allegedly requested bribes for Báez. Estela Kank, former owner of Kank y Costilla, described collusion by De Vido and Báez to force her to sell her company to Báez. Sergio Acevedo, former governor of Santa Cruz, said that Kirchner demanded an increase of over 300% in Báez's monthly public-works budget. Acevedo made similar accusations against the Kirchners in 2009, saying that public works in the province were always performed by firms associated with Báez.\n\nLanata aired an interview with Miriam Quiroga, Néstor Kirchner's secretary, who described people moving full bags of money from the Casa Rosada and the Quinta de Olivos to El Calafate (Kirchner's hometown) with the Tango 01 presidential aircraft. When later, in 2015, Quiroga was questioned by Judge Luis Rodríguez she confessed that these were false allegations intended to promote a book on the subject co-authored with her husband.\nIn the 2014 Lanata's interview with Quiroga, she alleged Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was aware of the operations; although she could not confirm the existence of a vault at the Kirchners' house, what she overheard made her suspect that it was likely. Former prosecutor Andrés Vivanco said that Báez's wealth is actually Néstor Kirchner's. He described two other vaults in Río Gallegos: one belonging to Cristina Kirchner, the other to Báez. The May 12 program included an interview with Antonio Cañas, the Kirchners' architect, who described the existence and location of a safe in their house's architectural plan.\n\nOn May 19, Lanata made further accusations of money laundering against Néstor Kirchner, his son Máximo, Lázaro Báez and sports agent Miguel Ángel Pires involving the acquisition of soccer players (including Rubén Ramírez, Pablo Lugüercio, Marcos Cáceres, Nicolás Cabrera, Leandro González and Martín Wagner) for Racing Club de Avellaneda.\n\nElisa Carrió accused Báez of removing evidence from a vault at his house, and a witness who helped empty the vault had photos and bags. At a press conference at his house, Báez showed reporters a wine cellar at the location of the alleged vault. Carrió replied that the photos showed both the wine cellar and the vault, and the wine cellar shown by Báez was next to a freshly-painted wall. Lanata aired the photos, explaining how Báez could have emptied the vault and prepared the area for invited journalists.\n\nA search and seizure took place at Madero Center several days after the first program. On June 16, Lanata aired security-camera tapes showing the removal of boxes, papers and file folders on April 12 at 14:20 (two days before the first program aired) and April 18 at 16:22 (hours before the search and seizure).\n\n\"La Nación\" exposed a business connection between President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and Lázaro Báez: they co-owned an plot of land outside El Calafate. She bought a half-share in 2006 and in turn sold it to Báez in 2008. Báez built a road and a luxury hotel; he paid rent for one-third of the rooms (even if they were empty), channeling public money to the Kirchners. Several politicians criticized the conflict of interest; deputies Patricia Bullrich and Laura Alonso asked the anticorruption office to investigate the situation, and Elisa Carrió and Mariana Zuvic asked to add this information to ongoing investigations. \n\nOn August 18 Lanata said that according to official reports, Cristina Kirchner visited the Seychelles on January 21 and 22, although there was no record of presidential activities on those days. The islands were mentioned by Elaskar as a fiscal destination. Several months after her visit, Seychelles no longer met the criteria for tax havens. Lanata also said that Néstor Kirchner created a shell subsidiary of his Panamanian corporation in Ireland. Oscar Parrilli said that Cristina Kirchner's stay in Seychelles was 13 hours rather than two days, and criticized Lanata for blindly accepting official information. Parrilli called Lanata a hitman and Grupo Clarín a threat to democracy. In return, Lanata sued Parrilli for harassment. Lanata aired an interview with Venezuelan journalist Nella De Luca, who was at Kirchner's hotel and confirmed her presence.\nHoracio Quiroga, a former businessman associated with Báez, described links from Báez and Néstor Kirchner to Lanata and the magazine \"Noticias\". Quiroga and Báez worked for the oil firms Epsur and Mishar, and were visited by an agent for Kirchner; his testimony was included in the court case.\n\nSeveral politicians petitioned the courts after the first program was aired. Deputy Elisa Carrió filed a case with judge Julián Ercolini, who was already investigating Lázaro Báez for conspiracy. Ercolini gave Carrió's case to a Kirchner supporter, judge Sebastián Casanello. Prosecutor Guillermo Marijuan began an investigation; attorney Alejandro Sánchez Kalbermatten filed a similar case against Lázaro Báez, his sons Martín Báez and Leandro Báez, Daniel Pérez Gadín and Fabián Rossi after Carrio's, but before her case was given to Casanello. The prosecutor was Miguel Ángel Osorio. Attorney Ricardo Monner Sans and deputies Manuel Garrido and Graciela Ocaña filed additional cases. Since the cases were similar, President of the Federal Chamber Martín Irurzun had to decide which judge would preside. Canicoba Corral rejected the case and sent it to Casanello, who sent it to the Federal Chamber; Casanello was finally confirmed as judge.\n\nCanicoba Corral roled that although a hidden camera may be acceptable as proof in investigative journalism, it is inadmissible in court, adding that he had not analyzed the case and had no opinion. Argentine case law does not accept hidden cameras as proof of crime, since they constitute self-incrimination. However, they are admissible when witnesses have conflicting testimony; an unedited film may clarify which witness is more accurate.\n\nProsecutors Ramiro González and Carlos Gonella asked Casanello for an investigation of Fariña and Elaskar when he was confirmed as judge. Their initial request did not mention Lázaro Báez or the Kirchners, but was open to expansion. The prosecutors requested unedited copies of both films aired by \"Periodismo para todos\" and the later TV programs, where Fariña and Elaskar said that they had lied. Jorge Lanata gave his testimony to the prosecutor José María Campagnoli on April 22. Senator Mario Cimadevilla of the Radical Civic Union criticized Gils Carbó for the appointment of prosecutors, including Gonella, without Senate approval. Carbó streamlined the appointment system, and the charges against him were dropped ten days later. Guillermo Marijuan appealed this, saying that he had received death threats against his daughters and was receiving protection. Campagnoli mentioned that the AFIP, IGJ and Migrations refused to give him information.\n\nFariña and Elaskar presented their testimony on June 10. Elaskar said that Lanata had scripted what he said on television, and denied any personal relationship with Báez. He also denied being coerced to sell his company (which he had said on TV) and said that the shell-corporation documents were forged by Lanata. Elaskar refused to reveal whether or not he had assets abroad, and said that he did not remember details about the sale of his firm. Fariña said that he had received $70,000 working for a man close to Báez, in addition to payment for his wife's artwork. He denied transporting bags of money, saying that he visited Uruguay and Mexico as a tourist. But, he acknowledged working for Báez at Austral Construcciones. Since the income detailed by Fariña was insufficient for his lifestyle, Casanello broadened his investigation.\n\nCarrió provided photos and a witness to the emptying of a vault at Báez's house in Santa Cruz; Casanello gave the witness protection, and proposed to send the case to the judiciary of the Santa Cruz province. Marijuan, however, thought it should be incorporated into the existing case. His appeal was received by the Federal Chamber and upheld by judges Horacio Cattani, Martín Irurzun and Eduardo Farah. Casanello ordered a search of Baez's house, including his safes. The investigation, 15 days after the accusation, was fruitless. Casanello also ordered a search of the walls, to determine if there had been a vault. The judge closed the cause after concluding that there never existed at Lázaro Báez's farm house the vaults that Lanata's TV report denounced as the storage of money related to its own accusations.\n\nBáez' lawyers asked Campagnoli to recuse the prosecutor, claiming that his sister was affiliated with the Civic Coalition Carrió led. Carbó accused him of abuse of authority and infringing on other prosecutors' jurisdictions. Campagnoli replied that he was just doing his job, and was supported by prosecutors' organizations.\n\nThere was no immediate search and seizure as a result of the first program. Although five cases were heard by two judges at that point, any judge could have secured potential evidence without waiting for the combining of the cases. Opposition parties criticized the lack of immediate action, attributing it to government-appointed chief of prosecutors Alejandra Gils Carbó. Several neighbours reported on April 17 that documentation was removed from the Madero Center (the alleged location of La Rosadita) over a several-hour period; a search and seizure was conducted the following day. Casanello requisitioned security-camera tapes to ascertain if documents were removed before the operation, and the investigation suggested that information may have been erased from computers between the first program and the search-and-seizure operation. It was discovered that Austral Construcciones (owned by Lázaro Báez and operating with large sums of money) was a client of La Rosadita and its telephones had Báez on speed dial. The son of Daniel Pérez Gadín (Báez's accountant) was identified in the security tapes as one of the men removing papers, boxes and file folders before the search and seizure; Casanello opened a separate investigation.\n\nStill not charged, Báez sued Fariña and Elaskar for defamation and subpoenaed Jorge Rial and Luis Ventura (hosts of \"Intrusos...\") as witnesses. Fariña's suit was heard by judge Raúl García, and Elaskar's by judge Fernando Pigni. García dismissed the suit.\n\nProsecutor Guillermo Marijuan extended the investigation on May 4 to Lázaro Báez, his son Martín, Báez's accountant Daniel Pérez Gadín and Fabián Rossi. He criticized Gonella for not including them in the original case, and for investigating Fariña and Elaskar only when the case made the news. Legislator Julio Raffo, from Proyecto Sur, accused public official Gonella of nonfeasance in office.\n\nElisa Carrió said that Miriam Quiroga's testimony was similar to her 2008 reports during an ongoing corruption case against Néstor Kirchner, Báez, Julio De Vido, Carlos Zannini, Ricardo Jaime, Claudio Uberti and Rudy Ulloa, and hoped that judge Julián Ercollini would expedite the case. Quiroga's testimony was heard by judge Julián Ercolini. She testified that Kirchner instructed Rudy Ulloa and Cristobal López to buy media and how to manage public works, but did not remember details. Quiroga was not asked about the bags of money she mentioned in Lanata's program because it concerned a different case; that testimony will be heard by judge Luis Rodríguez. Daniel Muñoz, Kirchner's former secretary, was accused by prosecutor Ramiro González of involvement in the conspiracy. Pablo Senyszyn, Néstor Kirchner's bodyguard, denied seeing money bags and said that any bags would have been detected by security; he was suspended and replaced by Claudia Katok and Cristina Caamaño.\n\nThe Uruguayan Air Force and Uruaguayan customs began an informal investigation of the Uruguayan link. Elaskar testified that Fariña sent the bags of money to Uruguayan financial companies, which in turn sent them to Switzerland. The Uruguayans investigated whether the flights were destined to Carrasco and whether the dates and crews matched. Deputy Juan Manuel Garino called for an investigation of a possible security breach at Uruguayan airports. Ministers Fernando Lorenzo and Eleuterio Fernández Huidobro addressed the Uruguayan Congress, describing controls on money laundering. Uruguayan President José Mujica said that such banking operations would not go unnoticed in his country, but acknowledged that money may have been smuggled; the minister of defense revealed the existence of more than 900 unregulated airports. The Uruguayan case was conducted by judge Martín Gesto and prosecutor José Gómez, with Interpol support. Before the Uruguayan Congress, judge Néstor Valetti criticized a lack of Argentine co-operation. Argentine deputy Graciela Ocaña accused the chancellery of blocking communications between the countries. As of January 2014, the investigation was stalled.\n\nThe Swiss courts began their own investigation with information from Argentine deputies Garrido and Ocaña; however, Switzerland required input from the Argentine judiciary to pursue the case. \"Le Matin\" and \"Tages-Anzeiger\" reported the ongoing Argentine controversy, and public opinion opposed illicit money in Swiss banks. However, the Swiss case is not directly related to the Argentine one. Casanello and prosecutor Marijuan were invited to Switzerland to confer with local judges, but their trip was cancelled.\n\nCasanello formally requested information about Teegan from the Panamanian courts. Since Báez has at least six companies in Florida, Elisa Carrió informed local prosecutors and American legislator Carl Levin (a money-laundering expert) about the case.\n\nInitially, the government had no comment about the controversy. Only deputy Carlos Kunkel said that although he did not know Lázaro Báez, if he committed a crime he had to go to prison; however, he thought there was insufficient evidence. Governor of Santa Cruz province Daniel Peralta denied any connection to Báez, saying that public works in the province were financed by the national government since 2008 through Vialidad Nacional. Once a Kirchner supporter, Peralta had turned to Federal Peronism. He said that the national government had invested $770 million in public works from 2007 to 2012, and that control of such finances was the purview of the SIGEN. Minister Julio de Vido considered the scandal an attempt to halt construction of the dams Néstor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Dams. Báez, in a news conference where he took no questions, considered it an attempt to defame Néstor Kirchner; he questioned Fariña and Elaskar's reliability and the authenticity of the documents shown on the program.\n\nSince Leonardo Fariña was the husband of television personality Karina Jelinek, the government tried to treat the program's revelations as a dispute between TV presenters on its controlled TV channels to discredit it. It hoped focusing Fariña would deflect attention from Kirchner. This attempt failed, and the extended coverage increased awareness of the controversy among the apolitical population. Details of the money's being weighed (instead of counted) and politicians' home vaults increased lay understanding of the corruption controversy's scope.\n\nPublic interest in the controversy resembled that in a telenovela; a large portion of the population awaited each new airing of \"Periodismo para todos\", and its revelations were discussed during the week. A survey concerning the controversy found that 80% of the respondents followed it, 70% thought the accusations were true and 65% thought it affected the president's public image. Two-thirds of the respondents agreed that the level of corruption during the Kirchner presidencies was similar (or higher) than that during the presidency of Carlos Menem. Public reception of the controversy may have been influenced by the ongoing Argentine economic crisis, the suspicion of presidential involvement and Lanata's persuasiveness.\n\nNational deputy Andrés Larroque considered the scandal a veiled coup attempt by the media. Writer Ricardo Forster minimized the significance of political corruption, considering interest in it by the media a threat to democracy. Presidential secretary Oscar Parrilli accused media groups of attempting to generate terrorism against the Kirchner presidencies. Presidential undersecretary Gustavo López said that the scandal was caused by corporate group warfare against the government. Alleged threats to democracy and allegations of coup attempts are a common element of Kirchnerite criticism of political opposition since the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector.\n\nThe government tried to shrink the audience for \"Periodismo para todos\" by rescheduling the most-important soccer match of the week against it. The tactic was unsuccessful; Lanata received 24.7 rating points, compared with 16 for the Boca-Newell's Old Boys match. Journalist Jorge Fernández Díaz said that soccer matches had not been scheduled so late the previous year, when \"Periodismo para todos\" had an average of 15 ratings points instead of 25. The June 16 match between River Plate and Lanús violated an Argentine Football Association rule requiring the last two matches of teams with chances to win a tournament to be played concurrently.\n\nAlthough Lázaro Báez intended to run for governor of Santa Cruz province in 2015, as of April 2013 he engaged in no political activity in the Justicialist Party or the Front for Victory. The \"Route of the K-Money\" episode of \"Periodismo para todos\" won a silver medal for Best Investigative Report in the 2014 New York Festivals.\n\n"}
{"id": "31326511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31326511", "title": "The Spider Bite", "text": "The Spider Bite\n\nThe Spider Bite or The Red Spot is a modern urban legend that emerged in Europe during the 1970s.\n\nThe legend features a young woman from an ordinary, northern location (England, New York City, etc.), who is on vacation abroad in an exotic, southern location (Mexico, South America, etc.). While sunbathing on the beach, she is bitten on the cheek by a spider. The bite swells into a large boil and she rushes home to seek medical treatment. She finds a doctor to lance the boil then hundreds of tiny spiders come running out of her cheek. She then goes insane from the shock.\n\nIn other versions, a young girl is asleep while a spider crawls across her face and rests on her cheek for a few moments. The next morning, she asks her mother about the red spot on her cheek and the mother responds, \"It looks like a spider bite. It will go away, just don't scratch it.\" As time passes, the spot grows into a small boil. She confronts her mother again and complains that it is getting larger and that it's sore. The mother replies, \"That happens sometimes, it's coming to a head.\" More days pass and the girl complains that it hurts and is unsightly. Finally concerned that it might be infected, the mother agrees to take her to a doctor, but he is not available until the next day. In order to soothe herself that evening, the girl takes a bath. As she soaks, the boil bursts and releases a swarm of baby spiders into the water from the eggs that the mother had laid. \n\nIn telling the story, there are versions that are set in one's own country instead of being abroad (\"e.g.,\" a Midwestern woman who is bitten in California). Usually, when the story is told to others, the location of the incident is quite specific.\n\nThe legend of \"The Spider Bite\" emerged as a modern legend in Europe in the late 1970s, but it echoes earlier manifestations of the bosom-serpent story type, where all types of creatures enter the body and sometimes reproduce there. Modern folklorists adopted the term bosom-serpent from Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1843 short story, \"Egotism, or, the Bosom Serpent\". The term is now used to generalize other legends in which living creatures enter the human body. In bosom-serpent type legends, the creatures usually have to be removed surgically, but sometimes they depart on their own, or even burst from the skin.\n\nThis urban legend provides a social commentary about the perception of the people who consider southern locales to be less clean, and more dangerous than their own home turf. Spiders are loathed by many people, but venomous, hairy, or especially large spiders make frequent appearances in legends. Spiders in urban legends have often taken cover in a variety of items ranging from cactus plants and food, to hairdos and within the human body, so it is natural to have a fear of invasion. Bengt af Klintberg's work in urban legends elaborates and explains that as a consequence of the absence of spiders in the modern urban environment, they have now assumed mythical proportions in our narrative tradition. Analysts have also suggested that bosom-serpent legends may represent pregnancy fears or fantasies.\n\n\n"}

It is a pyridylallylamine, and is structurally different from other antidepressants.\n\nZimelidine was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Arvid Carlsson, who was then working for the Swedish company Astra AB. It was discovered following a search for drugs with structures similar to brompheniramine (it is a derivative of brompheniramine), an antihistamine with antidepressant activity. Zimelidine was first sold in 1982.\n\nWhile zilmelidine had a very favorable safety profile, within a year and a half of its introduction, rare case reports of Guillain–Barré syndrome emerged that appeared to be caused by the drug, prompting its manufacturer to withdraw it from the market. After its withdrawal, it was succeeded by fluvoxamine and fluoxetine (derived from the antihistamine diphenhydramine) in that order, and the other SSRIs.\n\nThe mode of action is a strong reuptake inhibition of serotonin from the synaptic cleft. Postsynaptic receptors are not acted upon.\n\nZimelidine was reported by Montplaisir and Godbout to be very effective for cataplexy in 1986, back when this was usually controlled by tricyclic antidepressants, which often had anticholinergic effects.
