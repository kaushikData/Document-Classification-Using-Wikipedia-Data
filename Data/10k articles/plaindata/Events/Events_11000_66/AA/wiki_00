{"id": "4291380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4291380", "title": "99 Problems", "text": "99 Problems\n\n\"99 Problems\" is the third single released by American rapper Jay-Z in 2004 from \"The Black Album\". The chorus hook \"I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one\" is taken from the Ice-T single \"99 Problems\" from the album \"Home Invasion\" (1993). The hook was coined during a conversation between Ice-T & Brother Marquis of Miami-based 2 Live Crew. Marquis later used the phrase in the 1996 2 Live Crew song \"Table Dance\".\n\nIn the song, Jay-Z tells a story about dealing with rap critics, racial profiling from a police officer who wants to search his car, and an aggressor. The song reached number 30 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nThe track was produced by Rick Rubin, his first hip hop production in many years. Rubin provided Jay-Z with a guitar riff and stripped-down beat that were once his trademarks. In creating the track Rubin used some classic 1980s sample staples such as \"The Big Beat\" by Billy Squier, \"Long Red\" by Mountain, and \"Get Me Back On Time\" by Wilson Pickett.\n\nThe title and chorus are derived from Ice-T's \"99 Problems\" from his 1993 album \"Home Invasion\". The song featured Brother Marquis of 2 Live Crew. The original song was more profane and describes a wide range of sexual conquests. Ice-T would re-record his version of the song with the Rubin/Jay-Z guitar riff for Body Count's 2014 album \"Manslaughter\" in order to \"reclaim\" the hook from being mis-attributed to Jay-Z. Portions of Ice-T's original lyrics were similarly quoted in a song by fellow rapper Trick Daddy on a track also titled \"99 Problems\" from his 2001 album \"Thugs Are Us.\" Jay-Z begins his third verse directly quoting lines from Bun B's opening verse off the track \"Touched\" from the UGK album \"Ridin' Dirty\".\n\nThe song has been one of the most discussed songs of the decade. The second verse, describing Jay-Z's traffic stop, has received much more attention than the rest of the song.\n\nThe second verse was based on an actual experience of Jay-Z in the 1990s in New Jersey. Jay-Z wrote that in 1994 he was pulled over by police while carrying cocaine in a secret compartment in his sunroof. Jay-Z refused to let the police search the car and the police called for the drug sniffing dogs. However, the dogs never showed up and the police had to let Jay-Z go. Moments after he drove away, he wrote that he saw a police car with the dogs drive by. Jay-Z's contention that he was pulled over for being black was later confirmed to have been common practice by the New Jersey police. In a discussion at the Celeste Bartos Forum at the New York Public Libraryl, Jay-Z described the second verse as representing a contest of wills between the car's driver who is \"all the way in the wrong\" for carrying illegal drugs, and a racist police officer who pulls over a driver not for any infraction but for being African-American. \"Both guys are used to getting their way\" and thus reluctant to back down, Jay-Z notes, and the driver \"knows a bit about the law because he's used to breaking it\" and asserts his legal rights.\n\nIn 2011 Southwestern Law School Professor Caleb Mason wrote an article with a line-by-line analysis of the second verse of the song from a legal perspective referencing the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, citing it as a useful tool for teaching law students search and seizure law involving search warrants, \"Terry\" stops, racial profiling, the exclusionary rule, and the motor vehicle exception. Mason writes that some of Jay-Z's lyrics are legally accurate and describe prudent behavior (e.g., identifying when police ask for consent to search, specifically asking if one is under arrest, and complying with the police order to stop rather than fleeing which would certainly result in a search of the car and might authorize police to use lethal force to stop a high speed chase). However, Mason also notes the song lyrics are legally incorrect in indicating that a driver can refuse an order to exit the car and that police would need a warrant to search a locked glove compartment or trunk (in fact, police would need probable cause to search a car). In 2012, Professor Emir Crowne of the University of Windsor's, Faculty of Law wrote the Canadian Response to Professor Mason's article. In it, he concludes that Jay-Z's lyrics may be legally correct under Canadian Law.\n\nWhile the song's meaning is widely debated, the chorus \"If you're having girl problems, I feel bad for you son/I've got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one\" was defined in Jay-Z's book, \"Decoded\", as referring to something different in each verse. In verse two, it refers to a police dog.\n\nPresident Obama quipped, in his humorous monologue at the White House Correspondents' Dinner on April 27, 2013: \"Some things are beyond my control. For example, this whole controversy about Jay-Z going to Cuba - it's unbelievable. I've got 99 problems and now Jay-Z is one.\"\nThe song garnered widespread acclaim. The song came in at #2 on \"Rolling Stone\"s top 100 songs of the '00s. On the updated list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, the song was added and came in at #172. The song was listed at #14 on Pitchfork Media's top 500 songs of the 2000s (decade) and in October 2011, \"NME\" placed it at number 24 on its list \"150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years\".\n\nJack White has hailed the song, describing it as \"the story of America ... in a nutshell, [it's] the story of all the struggles in America, black or white, [and of] class systems\".\n\nThe song won Best Rap Solo Performance at the 47th Grammy Awards.\n\nIn 2008, the song was memorably covered by Barry Chuckle of British children's comedy duo The Chuckle Brothers as part of BBC Radio 1's Scott Mills show. Mills described the cover as \"superior, in essence, to the original\".\n\nOn January 21, 2009, Jay-Z performed the song as part of his set at the Staff Ball, the last official event of Barack Obama's inauguration. The ball was exclusively for 4,000 staffers who had worked on Obama's campaign. Jay-Z tweaked the lyrics to suit the historic atmosphere, and the crowd sang along: \"I got 99 problems but a Bush ain't one\", replacing \"bitch\" with the name of the former President. At a rally for President Barack Obama in November 2012 Jay-Z changed the lyrics of the song to \"If you having world problems I feel bad for you son / I got 99 problems but Mitt ain't one.\"\n\nEminem referenced the lyrics in his song \"So Much Better\" track, part of \"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\" album, with \"I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one/ She's all 99 of 'em; I need a machine gun\".\n\nDanger Mouse famously remixed this song with samples from \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles as part of his oft-bootlegged album \"The Grey Album\". The track was also remixed with Linkin Park for the EP \"Collision Course\", being mixed with the Linkin Park songs \"Points of Authority\" and \"One Step Closer\". The thrash metal group Body Count combined the lyrics of Ice-T's \"99 Problems\" with the guitar riff from Jay-Z's \"99 Problems\" for the song \"99 Problems BC\" on the album \"Manslaughter\". Big Sean referenced the lyrics in Drake's \"All Me\" with the line \"I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one\". Iggy Azalea referenced the lyrics in Ariana Grande's \"Problem\" with the line \"I got 99 problems but you won't be one\". In 2009, fellow rapper and collaborator Kid Cudi, referenced the song in the opening verse of his song \"\" with the line \"I got 99 problems and they all bitches\". The singer Hugo recorded a bluegrass cover of the song in 2011. There have been several remixes of the track including versions by The Prodigy and Linkin Park. In particular, Jay-Z had been quoted as saying that The Prodigy remix is one of his favorites by keeping the main guitar riff but more heavier and darker which in turn was the inspiration for The Prodigy track 'Spitfire' written by Liam Howlett and released in 2005.\n\nThe music video premiered in April 2004 and was directed by Mark Romanek. It received praises from critics such as Armond White, and was nominated for four MVPA awards in 2005, of which it won three. It also won the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rap Video, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Cinematography, as well as gaining nominations for Video of the Year and Best Male Video. It was criticized, however, by the Humane Society of the United States for scenes in the video that glorified dog fighting.\n\nThe video accompanied \"The Black Album\" which, at the time, was to be Jay-Z's final release. Jay-Z has stated that he wanted the video to be as auto-biographical as the rest of the album. The goal for the video was to create a portrait of where Jay-Z grew up. In a conversation with the video's director, Jay-Z stated that he wanted the video to \"make a pissy wall look like art\". The job of directing this video was originally intended for Quentin Tarantino, however Rick Rubin suggested that Jay-Z offer the job to Mark Romanek. Due to the research and influence of Romanek and the videos cinematographer, Joaquin Baca Asay, the video borrows visual characteristics from many New York street photographers and black and white photographs (Martin Dixon and Eugene Richards to name a few). The video is shot entirely on black-and-white film. It consists mainly of scenes filmed in close proximity to Jay-Z's childhood home, The Marcy Houses in Bedford Stuyvesant.

{"id": "840055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=840055", "title": "Apocalypticism", "text": "Apocalypticism\n\nApocalypticism is the religious belief that there will be an apocalypse, a term which originally referred to a revelation, but now usually refers to the belief that the end of the world is imminent, even within one's own lifetime. This belief is usually accompanied by the idea that civilization will soon come to a tumultuous end due to some sort of catastrophic global event.\n\nApocalypticism is often conjoined with the belief that esoteric knowledge that will likely be revealed in a major confrontation between good and evil forces, destined to change the course of history. Apocalypses can be viewed as good, evil, ambiguous or neutral, depending on the particular religion or belief system promoting them. They can appear as a personal or group tendency, an outlook or a perceptual frame of reference, or merely as expressions in a speaker's rhetorical style.\n\nSome scholars believe that Jesus' apocalyptic teachings were the central message Jesus intended to impart, more central even than his messianism.\n\nVarious Christian eschatological systems have developed, providing different frameworks for understanding the timing and nature of apocalyptic predictions. Some like dispensational premillennialism tend more toward an apocalyptic vision, while others like postmillennialism and amillennialism, while teaching that the end of the world could come at any moment, tend to focus on the present life and contend that one should not attempt to predict when the end should come, though there have been exceptions such as postmillennialist Jonathan Edwards, who estimated that the end times would occur around the year 2000.\n\nThe gospels portray Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet, described by himself and by others as the Son of Man – translated as the Son of Humanity – and hailing the restoration of Israel. Jesus himself, as the Son of God, a description also used by himself and others for him, was to rule this kingdom as lord of the Twelve Apostles, the judges of the twelve tribes.\n\nAlbert Schweitzer emphasized that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet, preparing his fellow Jews for the imminent end of the world. Many historians concur that Jesus was an apocalyptic prophet, most notably Paula Fredriksen, Bart Ehrman, and John P. Meier. E. P. Sanders portrays Jesus as expecting to assume the \"viceroy\" position in God's kingdom, above the Apostles, who would judge the twelve tribes, but below God. He concludes, however, that Jesus seems to have rejected the title Messiah, and he contends that the evidence is uncertain to whether Jesus meant himself when he referred to the Son of Man coming on the clouds as a divine judge (see also Daniel's Vision of Chapter 7), and further states that biblical references to the Son of Man as a suffering figure are not genuine.\n\nThe preaching of John was, \"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand\" (), and Jesus also taught this same message (; Mark 1:15). Additionally, Jesus spoke of the signs of \"the close of the age\" in the Olivet Discourse in Matthew 24 (and parallels), near the end of which he said, \"[T]his generation will not pass away until all these things take place\" (v. 34). Interpreters have understood this phrase in a variety of ways, some saying that most of what he described was in fact fulfilled in the destruction of the Temple in the Roman Siege of Jerusalem (see Preterism), and some that \"generation\" should be understood instead to mean \"race\" (see NIV marginal note on ) among other explanations. Other scholars such as Ehrman and Sanders accept that Jesus was simply mistaken, that he believed the end of the world to be imminent. \"We make sense of these pieces of evidence if we think that Jesus himself told his followers that the Son of Man would come while they still lived. The fact that this expectation was difficult for Christians in the first century helps prove that Jesus held it himself. We also note that Christianity survived this early discovery that Jesus had made a mistake very well.\" \n\nThere are a few recorded instances of apocalypticism leading up to the year 1000. However they mostly rely on one source, Rodulfus Glaber.\n\nSpecifically in Western Europe, during the year 1000, Christian philosophers held many debates on when Jesus was actually born and when the apocalypse would actually occur. This caused confusion between the common people on whether or not the apocalypse would occur at a certain time. Because both literate and illiterate people commonly accepted this idea of the apocalypse, they could only accept what they heard from religious leaders on when the disastrous event would occur. Religious leader, Abbo II of Metz believed that Jesus was born 21 years after year 1 which was commonly accepted by close circles of his followers. Abbot Heriger of Lobbes, argued that the birth of Jesus occurred not during the year 1 but rather during the 42nd year of the common era. Eventually many scholars came to accept that the apocalypse would occur sometime between 979-1042.\n\nAlthough there were debates about the apocalypse itself, few people actually understood the consequences of what would happen if the apocalypse occurred. Unfortunately, few documents from around the year 1000 exist to actually interpret what people thought would happen, and because of this, many scholars are unaware of what people actually felt. People do understand that the idea of apocalypticism has influenced several Western Christian European leaders into social reform.\n\nWith influences by the German ruler Otto III, the Sibyls, and Abbot Adso of Montier-en-Dier, many of the people under these influential figures felt that their rule was a sign of spiritual preparation for the apocalypse itself. It is suggested that because of the influence and reputation of these people, many wanted to follow suit and believe that the apocalypse would occur simply because their leaders felt it to be true.\n\nThe Fifth Monarchy Men were active from 1649 to 1661 during the Interregnum, following the English Civil Wars of the 17th century. They took their name from a belief in a world-ruling kingdom to be established by a returning Jesus in which prominently figures the year 1666 and its numerical relationship to a passage in the Biblical Book of Revelation indicating the end of earthly rule by carnal human beings.\n\nAround 1649, there was great social unrest in England and many people turned to Oliver Cromwell as England's new leader. The Parliamentary victors of the First English Civil War failed to negotiate a constitutional settlement with the defeated King Charles I. Members of Parliament and the Grandees in the New Model Army, when faced with Charles's perceived duplicity, reluctantly tried and executed him.\n\nIsaac Newton proposed that the world would not end until the year 2060, based largely on his own study and deciphering of Bible codes.\n\nThe Millerites were the followers of the teachings of William Miller who, in 1833, first shared publicly his belief in the coming Second Coming of Jesus Christ in roughly the year 1844.\n\nThe ideological descendants of the Millerites are the Seventh-day Adventists. One notable example was the following of Margaret Rowen, a member of the Los Angeles Seventh-Day Adventists, who believed the second coming of Jesus was to strike on February 6, 1925.\n\nLike many 19th-century American Protestant churches, the Mormon tradition teaches that adherents are living shortly before the Second Coming of Christ. The term \"latter days\" is used in the official names of several Mormon churches, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. LDS president Wilford Woodruff preached multiple times that many then-living adherents \"would not taste death\" before witnessing the return of Christ.\n\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses denomination has issued several predictions of the end of the world. It presently believes that the world entered the \"latter days\" in 1914 and that the actual return of Christ is going to take place before the death of some contemporaries of people who were alive in 1914.\n\nAccording to Jainism, time is beginningless and eternal. The \"Kālacakra\", the cosmic wheel of time, rotates ceaselessly. The wheel of time is divided into two half-rotations, \"Utsarpiṇī\" or ascending time cycle and \"Avasarpiṇī\", the descending time cycle, occurring continuously after each other.\n\n\"Utsarpiṇī\" is a period of progressive prosperity and happiness where the time spans and ages are at an increasing scale, while \"Avsarpiṇī\" is a period of increasing sorrow and immorality with decline in timespans of the epochs. Each of this half time cycle consisting of innumerable period of time (measured in \"sagaropama\" and \"palyopama\" years) is further sub-divided into six आरा \"(aras)\" or epochs of unequal periods.\n\nThe 6 \"aras\" are as follows:\n\nThe first four aras constitute millions and billions of years, whereas the last two are of 21000 years each. No divine or supernatural beings are credited or responsible with these spontaneous temporal changes, either in a creative or overseeing role, rather human beings and creatures are born under the impulse of their own \"karmas\".\n\nCurrently, we are living is in \"Duḥṣama\" epoch of \"avasarpiṇī\" (descending phase). The \"Duḥṣama\" \"ara\", i.e. the fifth \"ara\" is said to begin around 2000 years ago. Thus, it will go on for around more 19000 years. And after further 21000 years of \"Duḥṣama- duḥṣamā\" \"ara\", i.e. sixth \"ara\", again the avsarpini cycle will be reversed into \"utsarpini\" cycle beginning with \"Suṣama-suṣamā\" \"ara\", i.e. first \"ara\". Thus, the cycle continues.\n\nBut, whether there will be an apocalypse while transitioning from sixth ara of \"avsarpini\" cycle to the first ara of \"utsarpini\" cycle is a matter of debate. Some Jains believe that since in the sixth \"ara\" people will be fed up of all the misery, they will turn to living natural life on their own after the completion of the \"ara\". Some believe that, for the contrasting change from a very unhappy time into a very happy time, an apocalypse will occur and there will be complete transformation of the earth and its inhabitants. Some also believe that an apocalypse can occur even during the transition from the fifth (current) epoch into the sixth epoch. Thus, even if an apocalypse is to occur, it will occur after 19000 years or after 40000 years (19000 + 21000).\n\nJewish apocalypticism holds a doctrine that there are two eras of history: the present era, which is a combination of good and evil, and a purely good world to come that will be ruled over by God. At the time of the coming era, there will be a messiah who will deliver the faithful into the new era. Due to incidents arising very early on in Jewish history, predictions about the time of the coming of the Jewish messiah were highly discouraged, lest people lose faith when the predictions did not come true during the lifespan of the believer.\n\nMoses of Crete, a rabbi in the 5th century, claimed to be the messiah and promised to lead the people, like the ancient Moses, through a parted sea back to Palestine. His followers left their possessions and waited for the promised day, when, at his command, many cast themselves into the sea, some finding death, others being rescued by sailors.\n\nThe 2011 end times prediction made by American Christian radio host Harold Camping stated that the Rapture and Judgment Day would take place on May 21, 2011, and that the end of the world would take place five months later on October 21, 2011.\n\nUFO religions sometimes feature an anticipated end-time in which extraterrestrial beings will bring about a radical change on Earth or lift the religious believers to a higher plane of existence. One such religious group's failed expectations of such an event served as the basis for the classic social psychology study \"When Prophecy Fails\".\n\nApocalypticism was especially evident with the approach of the millennial year 2000, in which simultaneous computer crashes caused by uncorrected instances of the Y2k bug were expected to throw global commerce and financial systems into chaos. Piggy-backing on these issues, and probably driven by the \"interesting date\" unsupported allegations of an apocalypse were common.\n\nThe 2012 doomsday prediction was a contemporary cultural meme proposing that cataclysmic and apocalyptic events would occur on December 21, 2012. This idea has been disseminated by numerous books, Internet sites and by TV documentaries with increasing frequency since the late 1990s. This date is derived from the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar which completes 12 baktuns or 1 Great cycle equaling 5,125 years on December 21 or 23, 2012. There is also a movie called \"2012\" made in 2009 inspired from this theory. The prediction given by the Mayans about what would happen at the end of this Great Cycle is described as a rebirth of this world and the beginning of an age of enlightenment. There are also other interpretations of assorted legends, scriptures, numerological constructions and prophecies encircling this date.\n\nSelf-claimed Christian \"numerologist\" David Meade predicted in 2017 that a hidden planet named Nibiru (sometimes known as Planet X) would collide with Earth on September 23, 2017. His claims received extensive media attention. He calculated his prediction based on numerical bible codes and coded messages in the Giza Pyramids. After his September 23 prediction failed, he revised the apocalypse to October 2017, where he predicted the seven-year tribulation would begin on October 15 as well as other events that month, such as magnitude 9.8 earthquakes, that people would levitate in the air (including Donald Trump and Mike Pence), a nuclear attack by China, Russia, and North Korea on the United States, and that Barack Obama would be president for an illegal third term. October passed without incident. He received criticism over his predictions from Christians and his theories have also been debunked by scientists, including NASA by stating that Nibiru does not exist and a collision with Earth is unlikely.\n\n"}

The film tells the story of the early life of evangelist Billy Graham, played by Armie Hammer. World Wide Pictures, the film distribution and production company that was created by the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA), did not work on the film's production. After almost a year and a half of delays, the film was released on DVD on March 16, 2010.\n\nA reporter (Jennifer O'Neill) is interviewing Charles Templeton on his deathbed. Told through the eyes of Templeton, the film shows Billy Graham’s life as a teenager during the Great Depression living at the family dairy farm in North Carolina. During this time, Graham becomes a Christian at a tent revival meeting. Later, Graham goes to Bob Jones College, then transfers to Florida Bible Institute after being identified as a failure by Bob Jones, Sr. Following his time at Florida Bible Institute, Graham goes to Wheaton College where he falls in love with classmate Ruth Bell, whom he ultimately marries. In the 1940s, Templeton and Graham become close until Templeton's scientific skepticism causes him to lose his faith and his friendship with Graham. The film finishes with Graham inviting his listeners to accept Christ as their personal savior in his Los Angeles crusade of 1949.\n\nScreenwriter-producer William Paul McKay and producer Lawrence Mortorff originally wanted John Hagee to portray Mordecai Ham but director Robby Benson, concerned that Hagee's controversial public persona would cause a distraction, cast Cliff Bemis instead.\n\nTo find the lead actor, producers held talent searches in Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.\n\nThe film was shot in Nashville and Watertown, Tennessee with a production budget of $3.6 million.\n\nAdvance screenings were held throughout the Bible Belt in Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, Missouri, Tennessee, Florida, Kentucky, Virginia and Arkansas. Thomas Nelson published a novelization, \"Billy: The Untold Story of a Young Billy Graham and the Test of Faith that Almost Changed Everything\", written by McKay and Ken Abraham.\n\n\"Billy: The Early Years\" opened on October 10, 2008, less than a month before Graham's 90th birthday, grossing $192,042 in 282 theaters during its opening weekend. The film would eventually gross a total of $347,328. In response to the film's box office reception, Mortorff said that \"Fireproof\", an evangelical film which had been released around the same time, might have unintentionally hurt the film. Mortorff also said that his team was planning a \"second wave\" of theatrical releases and looking forward to recovering its losses through DVD sales and TV deals.\n\nAlthough Billy Graham's son, Franklin Graham, criticized the film, Gigi Graham, eldest daughter of Billy Graham, supported the film, saying that the film has the \"Gospel of Jesus in there\" and is \"positive toward my parents and their ministry.\" In a review of the film, critic Roger Moore commented that a \"bland leading man in a movie without much of a biographical spark to it makes for a dull sermon indeed.\"\n\nA CBN review has described the film as having \"a simple and unassuming charm about it, much like the man it honors.\"\n\nAt the Epiphany Awards, Hammer's performance received a Grace Award nomination for most inspiring performance in movies & TV.\n\n"}

In Catholic funerals, the Church seeks firstly to offer the Mass for the benefit of the soul of the deceased so that the temporal effects of sin in Purgatory may be extinguished, and secondly to provide condolence and comfort for the deceased's family and exhort the latter to pray, along with the Church, for the soul of the departed.\n\nIn general, Catholics are to be given a Catholic funeral upon their death. Catechumens are to be considered as Catholics with regard to funeral matters, and the local ordinary may permit unbaptized children whose parents intended to have them baptized to be given a Catholic funeral. The local ordinary may also permit baptized persons who were not Catholic to be given a Catholic funeral, provided their own minister is not available, unless they were clearly opposed to it.\n\nHowever, Catholic burial rites are to be refused even to baptized Catholics who fall within any of the following classifications, unless they gave some sign of repentance before death:\n\nThe Latin Church also has some rules that are not common to all the Eastern Catholic Churches regarding the church in which the funeral rites are to be celebrated, the funeral dues that are payable to a priest for conducting the funeral and the cemetery in which they are to be buried.\n\nWhat follows concerns practice in the Roman Rite of the Latin Church. Practice within Eastern Catholic Churches is basically similar, but takes account of different traditions and follows different liturgical norms. There are some variations also with regard to other Latin liturgical rites.\n\nThe successive ordinary forms of the Roman Rite in use before the Second Vatican Council are now extraordinary forms. That of 1962 is explicitly authorized for continued use, under certain conditions, such as the limitation to a single such parish Mass on Sundays, by the \"motu proprio\" \"Summorum Pontificum\". Funerals are one of the occasions on which this document states: \"For faithful and priests who request it, the pastor should also allow celebrations in this extraordinary form for special circumstances.\"\n\nWhile funerals may be held on any day, the special funeral Mass for such occasions are not to be celebrated on \"Solemnities that are Holydays of Obligation, Thursday of Holy Week, the Paschal Triduum, and the Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Easter\". As a rare exception, Pope Benedict XVI allowed Cardinal Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone to celebrate a single funeral Mass for a group of victims of the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake on Good Friday, when no Mass at all is normally offered.\n\nThe first portion of the funeral rites involves the parish priest and other clergy going to the house of the deceased. One cleric carries the cross and another carries a vessel of holy water. Before the coffin is removed from the house it is sprinkled with the holy water. The priest, with his assistants, says the psalm \"De profundis\" with the antiphon \"Si iniquitates\". Then the procession sets out for the church. The cross-bearer goes first, followed by members of the clergy carrying lighted candles. The priest walks immediately before the coffin, and the friends of the deceased and others walk behind it.\n\nAs they leave the house, the priest intones the antiphon \"Exsultabunt Domino\", and then the psalm \"Miserere\" is recited or chanted in alternate verses by the cantors and clergy. On reaching the church the antiphon \"Exsultabunt\" is repeated. As the body is placed \"in the middle of the church\", the responsorial \"Subvenite\" is recited.\n\nHistorical precedents provide that, if the corpse is a layman, the feet are to be turned towards the altar. If the corpse is a priest, then the position is reversed, the head being towards the altar. The earliest reference to this is in Johann Burchard's \"Diary\". Burchard was the master of ceremonies to Pope Innocent VIII and Pope Alexander VI. The idea seems to be that the bishop (or priest) in death should occupy the same position in the church as during life, facing his people who he taught and blessed in Christ's name.\n\nAccording to another tradition not now considered obligatory in the Roman Rite, the feet of all Christians both before the altar and in the grave should be pointed to the East. This custom is alluded to by Bishop Hildebert at the beginning of the 12th century, and its symbolism is discussed by Guillaume Durand. \"A man ought so to be buried\", he says, \"that while his head lies to the West his feet are turned to the East...\"\n\nNext comes a cycle of prayers, the funeral Mass, and absolution of the dead. Candles are lit around the coffin, and they are allowed to burn throughout this stage.\n\nThe prayers offered are the Office of the Dead. In the earlier forms, certain omissions are made throughout the prayers. For example, each psalm ends with Requiem aeternam instead of the Gloria Patri.\n\nThe differences between a Requiem Mass and the usual Mass have been indicated above.\n\nA funeral Mass is a form of Mass for the Dead or Requiem Mass, so called because of the first word of what in earlier forms of the Roman Rite was the only Introit (entrance antiphon) allowed: \"Réquiem ætérnam dona eis, Dómine; et lux perpétua lúceat eis.\" (\"Eternal rest give to them, O Lord; and let perpetual light shine upon them\"). As revised in 1970, the Roman Missal also provides alternative Introits.\n\nThe bier holding the body is positioned centrally close to the sanctuary of the church. A deceased lay person's feet are towards the altar, but a priest's are away from the altar, positions reminiscent of their relative positions when alive and celebrating Mass.\n\nA funeral Mass concludes with the rite of commendation of the dead person, in which the coffin containing the body is sprinkled with holy water and incensed. Earlier forms of the Roman Rite call this the absolution at the bier (\"absolutio ad feretrum\").\n\nIn earlier forms of the Roman Rite, a Requiem Mass differs in several ways from the usual Mass in that form. Some parts that were of relatively recent origin (including some that have been excluded from all Masses in the 1970 revision) are omitted. Examples are the psalm \"Iudica\" at the start of Mass, the prayer said by the priest before reading the Gospel (or the blessing of the deacon, if a deacon reads it), and the first of the two prayers of the priest for himself before receiving Communion. Other omissions include the use of incense at the Introit and the Gospel, the kiss of peace, lit candles held by acolytes when a deacon chants the Gospel, and blessings. Black is the obligatory liturgical colour of the vestments in the earlier forms, while the revised form allows a choice between black and violet, and in some countries, such as the United States, England, and Wales, white. The sequence\" Dies Iræ\", recited or sung between the Tract and the Gospel, is an obligatory part of the Requiem Mass in the earlier forms. As its opening words, \"Dies irae\" (Day of wrath), indicate, this poetic composition speaks of the Day of Judgment in fearsome terms; it then appeals to Jesus for mercy.\n\nSome of these differences may have arisen from treating this Mass as supplementary to the Mass of the day. In other cases, the Requiem Mass preserves the tradition of a more primitive age. The suppression of the Alleluia, Gloria in excelsis, and the Gloria Patri seems to point to a sense of the incongruity of joyful themes in the presence of God's searching and inscrutable judgments. In the early Christian ages, however, it seems that the Alleluia, especially in the East, was regarded as especially appropriate to funerals.\n\nWhat is called absolution of the dead, although the 1969 revision of the liturgy of the Roman Rite replaced it with what is called the Commendation, is used when the 1962 form is celebrated. It is a series of prayers for pardon said over the body of a deceased Catholic following a Requiem Mass and before burial. The absolution of the dead does not forgive sins or confer the sacramental absolution of the Sacrament of Penance. Rather, it is a series of prayers to God that the person's soul will not have to suffer the temporal punishment in purgatory due for sins which were forgiven during the person's life.\n\nDuring the absolution, the \"Libera me, Domine\" is sung while the priest incenses the coffin and sprinkles it with holy water. The prayer for absolution is said by the priest, and then the \"In paradisum\" is sung while the body is carried from the church.\n\nAfter the absolution, the body is carried to the grave. The tomb or burial plot is then blessed, if it has not been blessed previously. A grave newly dug in an already consecrated cemetery is considered blessed, and requires no further consecration. However, a mausoleum erected above ground, or even a brick chamber beneath the surface, is regarded as needing blessing when used for the first time. This blessing is short and consists only of a single prayer after which the body is again sprinkled with holy water and incensed. Apart from this, the service at the graveside is very brief.\n\nThe final petition made by the priest is \"May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed through the mercy of God rest in peace.\" At that point, the graveside ceremony and the burial is complete.\n\nMany Catholic families make a donation to the priest in honor of the dead family member. The donation is usually money, but in some cases the family may donate a vestment, Communion ware, i.e. a chalice, a ciborium, and a pyx for the priest to use in his services or for a missionary priest who needs things for his ministry.\n\nMany Catholic families have Requiem Masses said in honor of family members who have died. This is usually offered on the deceased person's birthday, the anniversary of the person's death (especially the first anniversary), and/or on special dates that are meaningful to the family.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16109582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16109582", "title": "Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site", "text": "Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site\n\nThe Charlesfort-Santa Elena Site is an important early colonial archaeological site on Parris Island, South Carolina. It contains the archaeological remains of a French settlement called Charlesfort, settled in 1562 and abandoned the following year, and the later 16th-century Spanish settlement known as Santa Elena. The Spanish remains include a fort built directly on top of the abandoned Charlesfort remains. This fort and other nearby structures have been called, at various times, Fort San Marcos, Fort San Felipe, and have the designated archaeological site identifiers 38BU51 and 38BU162. Because of their remarkable state of preservation, and their importance in understanding early French and Spanish colonial practices, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2001. The site is accessible through the United States Marine Corps Recruit Depot in Port Royal, South Carolina.\n\nCharlesfort was established when a French expedition, organized by Huguenot leader Admiral Gaspard de Coligny and led by the Norman navigator Jean Ribault, landed at the site on the May River in February 1562, before moving north to Port Royal Sound. There, on present-day Parris Island, South Carolina, Ribault left twenty-eight men to build a settlement. Ribault then returned to France to arrange supplies for the new colony but was arrested in England after becoming involved in the period of unrest known as the French Wars of Religion, which prevented his return.\n\nAfter Ribault left, most of the settlers' stores were burned, and Captain Albert de la Pierria died in a mutiny, possibly as a reaction to his heavy discipline. Without supplies or leadership, and beset by hostility from the native population, all but one of the remaining colonists sailed back to Europe after only a year. They built their own boat and set sail, without compass, across the Atlantic. During the long voyage in an open boat, they were reduced to cannibalism before the survivors were finally rescued in English waters by an English ship, and some eventually reached France. Shortly after the colonists' departure, Hernando de Manrique de Rojas commanded a Spanish force from Cuba that destroyed the French fort, and took captive the one Frenchman who had remained with the local Native Americans nearby.\n\nFounded in 1566 on the site of Charlesfort, Santa Elena was the first capital of Spanish Florida. Fort San Salvador, a simple blockhouse, was built first, and then Fort San Felipe was built directly on top of the old French fort in that year, with a new moat (the French one having been filled in). It was occupied until 1570, when it was destroyed by fire. The Spanish then built a second fort, also called Fort San Felipe, at an unknown nearby location. The fort and town were abandoned in 1576 due in part to hostility of the local Native Americans.\n\nIn 1577 the Spanish returned, and built Fort San Marcos. It was used until 1582 or 1583, when a second Fort San Marcos was constructed. This fortification had a moat dug around it in 1586, in anticipation of an attack by Sir Francis Drake. Santa Elena and the fortifications were finally abandoned in 1587. At its height, the town had about sixty dwellings, with an estimated population of 400-450.\n\nThe area's archaeological importance was first identified in the mid-19th century by amateurs, who found what they believed to be Charlesfort, and excavated large hinges such as would have been used on a large gate. In the summer of 1917 some of the earthworks associated with the first Fort San Felipe were leveled by Marine Corps personnel, filling in part of the moat. In the 1920s Major George Osterhout led an excavation of that site, which he concluded was that of Charlesfort. In response to this determination, a memorial marker was placed at the site.\n\nOsterhout's interpretation was soon disputed, and by the 1950s archaeological consensus was that the site was part of Spanish Santa Elena. It was only after a series of excavations, running from the 1970s to the 1990s, that the full history and layout of the area was identified. Identification of the French fort location was made possible by the restricted location of distinctively French artifacts, and by the evidence that multiple moats had been dug around the site of the first Fort San Marcos.\n\nThe site is one of unparalleled importance in the early colonial history of North America and South Carolina, exemplifying the early competition for control of the region. Finds at the site also include the only known early Spanish pottery kiln on the continent. Since the area was never developed agriculturally, even surface-level remains continue to be found.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "59866", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59866", "title": "Charleston (dance)", "text": "Charleston (dance)\n\nThe Charleston is a dance named for the harbor city of Charleston, South Carolina. The rhythm was popularized in mainstream dance music in the United States by a 1923 tune called \"The Charleston\" by composer/pianist James P. Johnson which originated in the Broadway show \"Runnin' Wild\" and became one of the most popular hits of the decade. \"Runnin' Wild\" ran from 29 October 1923, through 28 June 1924. The peak year for the Charleston as a dance by the public was mid-1926 to 1927.\n\nWhile the dance probably came from the \"star\" or challenge dances that were all part of the African-American dance called Juba, the particular sequence of steps which appeared in \"Runnin' Wild\" were probably newly devised for popular appeal. \"At first, the step started off with a simple twisting of the feet, to rhythm in a lazy sort of way. [This could well be the Jay-Bird.] When the dance hit Harlem, a new version was added. It became a fast kicking step, kicking the feet, both forward and backward and later done with a tap.\" Further changes were undoubtedly made before the dance was put on stage. In the words of Harold Courlander, while the Charleston had some characteristics of traditional Negro dance, it \"was a synthetic creation, a newly-devised conglomerate tailored for wide spread popular appeal.\" Although the step known as \"Jay-Bird\", and other specific movement sequences are of Afro-American origin, no record of the Charleston being performed on the plantation has been discovered.\n\nAlthough it achieved popularity when the song \"Charleston\", sung by Elisabeth Welch, was added in the production \"Runnin' Wild\", the dance itself was first introduced in Irving C. Miller's \"Liza\" in the spring of 1923.\n\nWillie \"The Lion\" Smith noted that the dance was known well before that; in particular, he mentions the version done by Russell Brown under the name \"Geechie dance\".\n\nThe characteristic Charleston beat, which Johnson said he first heard from Charleston dockworkers, incorporates the clave rhythm and was considered by composer and critic Gunther Schuller to be synonymous with the Habanera, and the Spanish Tinge. Johnson actually recorded several \"Charlestons,\" and in later years derided most of them as being of \"that same damn beat.\" Several of these were recorded on player piano rolls, several of which have survived to this day.\n\nThe Charleston and similar dances such as the Black Bottom which involved \"Kicking up your heels\" were very popular in the later part of the 1920s. They became less popular after 1930, possibly because after seven years of being fashionable people simply became less interested. The new fashion for floor level sheath evening dresses was also probably a factor. The new dresses constricted the leg movements essential for the Charleston. There is a British Pathé Instructional Short from 1933 in which a new variation – The \"Crawl Charleston\" – is demonstrated by Santos Casini and Jean Mence. This shows a very sedate version of dance similar to a Tango or Waltz. It wasn't until dress hem lines rose toward the end of the thirties that the Charleston is again seen in film.\n\nA slightly different form of Charleston became popular in the 1930s and 1940s, and is associated with Lindy Hop. In this later Charleston form, the hot jazz timing of the 20s Charleston was adapted to suit the swing jazz music of the 1930s and 1940s. This style of Charleston has many common names, though the most common are Lindy Charleston, Savoy Charleston, 30s or 40s Charleston and Swing(ing) Charleston. In both 20s Charleston and Swinging Charleston, the basic step takes eight counts and is danced either alone or with a partner.\n\nFrankie Manning and other Savoy dancers saw themselves as doing Charleston steps within the Lindy rather than to be dancing Charleston.\n\nToday Charleston is an important dance in Lindy Hop dance culture, danced in many permutations: alone (solo), with a partner, or in groups of couples or solo dancers. The basic step allows for a vast range of variations and improvisation. Both the 20s and Swinging Charleston styles are popular today, though swinging Charleston is more commonly integrated into Lindy Hop dancing.\n\nCharleston can be danced solo, or with a partner. Its simple, flexible basic step makes it easy to concentrate on styling, improvisation and musicality.\n\nWhichever style of Charleston one chooses, whether dancing alone, with a partner, or in groups, the basic step resembles the natural movement of walking, though it is usually performed in place. The arms swing forward and backwards, with the right arm coming forward as the left leg 'steps' forward, and then moving back as the opposite arm/leg begin their forwards movement. Toes are not pointed, but feet usually form a right angle with the leg at the ankle. Arms are usually extended from the shoulder, either with straight lines, or more frequently with bent elbows and hands at right angles from the wrist (characteristics of many African dances). Styling varies with each Charleston type from this point.\n\nSolo 20s Charleston has gained popularity in the early 2000s, in many local Lindy Hop scenes around the world, prompted by competitions such as the Ultimate Lindy Hop Showdown (in 2005 and 2006 particularly) and workshops in the dance taught by high-profile dancers such as the Harlem Hot Shots (formerly known as The Rhythm Hot Shots) and a range of independent dancers.\n\nUsually danced to hot jazz music recorded or composed in the 1920s, solo 20s Charleston is styled quite differently from the Charleston associated with the 1930s, 1940s and Lindy Hop, though they are structurally similar.\n\nSolo 20s Charleston is usually danced to music at comparatively high tempos (usually above 200 or 250 beats per minute, with tempos above 300 BPM considered 'fast'), and is characterized by high-energy dancing. Faster movements are often contrasted with slower, dragging steps and improvisations.\n\nAs it is danced today, solo 20s Charleston often combines not only steps from dances associated with the 1920s. The most valued form of solo 20s Charleston combines choreography with improvisation and creative variations on familiar dance steps. Above all, the most popular and most \"successful\" solo 20s Charleston dancers respond to the music in creative ways to express themselves.\n\nSolo 20s Charleston is often danced in groups on the social dance floor or in formal choreography. Latterly, a derivative of the Charleston, known as the 'Chevin', has been witnessed in European dance halls. The origins of the Chevin are not known, however some proponents suggest it is named after Elliott Chevin, a Serbian freedom fighter.\n\nSolo 20s Charleston competitions often utilize elements of the jam circle format, where individual competitors take turns dancing alone for the audience (usually for intervals of a phrase or number of phrases). Competitors move forwards to the audience out of an informal line, usually taking advantage of this movement to perform 'strolls' or other 'traveling' steps, taking the opportunity to \"shine\".\n\nDespite the emphasis on solo dancing in these sorts of competitions, there is often much interaction between competitors and between the audience and competitors, frequently in the employment of comic devices (such as \"silly walks\" or impersonations) or showy and physically impressive \"stunt\" moves. This type of interaction is typical of the call and response of West African and Aphro-American music and dance. In this call and response, audiences and fellow competitors encourage dancers with cheers, shouts, applause, physical gestures and other feedback.\n\nThis sort of competition structure is increasingly popular in Lindy Hop communities around the world, providing added challenges for dancers, new types of pleasure for audiences and emphasizing social dancing skills such as improvisation and musicality. This structure also echoes the cutting contests of jazz music which Ralph Ellison describes in his stories about live jazz music in the 1930s.\n\nPartner Charleston uses the basic step described above, though stylistic changes over the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s affected the styling, as well as ways of holding a partner. Traditionally partner Charleston was danced by a man and a woman, but now both men and women may dance with same sex partners.\n\nIn the 20s Partner Charleston couples stand facing each other in a traditional European partner dancing pose, often referred to as closed position which aids leading and following. The leader's right hand is placed on the follower's back between their shoulder blades. The follower's left hand rests on the leader's shoulder or biceps. The leader's left hand and the follower's right hand are clasped palm to palm, held either at shoulder height or higher. Partners may maintain space between their bodies or dance with their torsos touching.\n\nThe basic step is for the leader to touch their left foot behind them, but not to shift their weight, on counts 1 and 2, while the follower mirrors the motion by touching their right foot in front of them without shifting weight. On counts 3 and 4, both partners bring their feet back to a standing position, but shift their weight onto the foot they have just moved. On counts 5 and 6, the leader touches their right foot in front of themselves while the follower touches their left foot back. On 7 and 8, both feet are brought back to the standing position where the necessary weight shift occurs to allow the basic step to repeat.\n\n30s and 40s Partner Charleston involves a number of positions, including \"jockey position\", where closed position is opened out so that both partners may face forward, without breaking apart.\n\nIn \"side-by-side\" Charleston partners open out the closed position entirely, so that their only points of connection are at their touching hips, and where the lead's right hand and arm touch the follower's back, and the follower's left hand and arm touch the leader's shoulder and arm. Both partners then swing their free arms as they would in solo Charleston. In both jockey and side-by-side Charleston the leader steps back onto their left foot, while the follower steps back onto their right.\nIn \"tandem Charleston\" one partner stands in front of the other (usually the follower, though the arrangement may vary), and both step back onto their left feet to begin. The partner behind holds the front partner's hands at their hip height, and their joined arms swing backwards and forwards as in the basic step.\n\nThere are numerous other variations on these holds, including \"hand-to-hand\" Charleston, and countless variations on the footwork (including Johnny's Drop, freezes, Savoy kicks and so on). Names for each vary in different local lindy hop scenes, though most have historic names associated with their creators or people in the community of the day. Aria Zapata and Teresa were the most famous dancers at the time.\n\nIn swing dance or Lindy Hop communities today, both solo 20s Charleston and solo swinging Charleston are often danced in groups arranged in a loose circle on the social dance floor, in two long lines of facing dancers (evenly spaced) or in other formations in more strictly choreographed performances.\n\nThey may choose to follow steps 'called' either by a designated Caller or by each dancer in turn. In this called context, the group perform the same step for a phrase, or until the new step is \"called\". Individual dancers often improvise within the structure of the called step, bringing their own personal \"flavor\".\n\nThere are many local variations on this group dancing, including the following. One person will typically call out a variation (such as turning 360 degrees in place on counts 5–8), which is then done by everyone beginning the next measure and again for the following 2 measures. If the caller doesn't call another step immediately, the dancers return to the (default) basic step. Switching sides is sometimes called, upon which the dancers hop on the left foot across to the other side on counts 5–8, turning 180 degrees to the left.\n\nIn the more casual social group context, individual dancers may choose to dance \"alone\", improvising in response to the music or copying dancers around them.\n\n\n\n"}

The award is presented by the China Television Artists Association. It is considered to be one of the most prestigious television awards, alongside the Feitian Awards and Magnolia Awards. The Golden Eagle Awards are a biennial awards ceremony, held on alternate years with the Feitian Awards since 2005.\n\nCandidates used to be nominated by members of the China Television Artists Association (CTAA) and managers of local television stations. The nationwide audience would vote by filling in a form published in the Popular TV Magazine (大众电视), and the nominee with the most votes would clinch the top awards. Each category had three winning candidates, with the one having the highest number of votes clinching the \"Best Award\" (最佳奖) while the other two would each receive an \"Outstanding Award\" (优秀奖). If the nominee with the highest number of votes does not win more than 30% of the total share, the \"Best Award\" will not be given and instead all three nominees each will take an \"Outstanding Award\".\n\nSince 2000 the awards ceremony has been held in Hunan province, and the awards ceremony has been preceded by the Golden Eagle TV Arts Festival, which was created by Hunan Television. The festival's awards include the Best Performing Arts Award, and the Most Popular Actor and Actress awards. The Best Performing Arts Award is given to the Audience's Choice nominee with the highest number of votes in the CTAA ballot, while the popularity awards are given at the end of the Golden Eagle Awards after several rounds of online voting.\n\nThe \"Outstanding Award\" for actor and actress categories was renamed to \"Audience's Choice for Actor\" or \"Audience's Choice for Actress\", and each category had about one to five nominees winning this award. There are three ballots - one for the judges, one for the members of the CTAA and one for the nationwide audience. The candidate who takes the most votes in the CTAA ballot wins the Best Performing Arts Actor or Actress award as well as the Audience's Choice Award, and is crowned Best Actor (视帝) or Actress (视后). The other candidates only win the Audience's Choice for Actor or Actress award.\n\nIn 2016, there was a major overhaul. The documentary and literary arts programme categories were cancelled, leaving only nine television award categories, and the Best Actor or Actress title have since been given exclusively to the winners who receive the Audience's Choice award.\n\n\n\n\nThe Golden Eagle Goddess (Chinese name: 金鹰女神, 2006–present) was chosen by audience votes on the official poll. From 2016, the winner has been decided by a professional jury. The chosen actress gets to perform the opening act at the China Golden Eagle TV Art Festival, which precedes the actual awards ceremony.\n\n"}

Scientific research has established that the mind and consciousness are closely connected with the physiological functioning of the brain, the cessation of which defines brain death. However, many believe in some form of life after death, which is a feature of many religions.\n\nNeuroscience is a large interdisciplinary field founded on the premise that all of behavior and all of the cognitive processes that constitute the mind have their origin in the structure and function of the nervous system, especially in the brain. According to this view, the mind can be regarded as a set of operations carried out by the brain.\n\nThere are multiple lines of evidence that support this view. They are here briefly summarized along with some examples.\n\n\nDeath is the cessation of all biological functions that sustain a living organism. Death was once defined as the cessation of heartbeat (cardiac arrest) and of breathing, but the development of CPR and prompt defibrillation have rendered that definition inadequate because breathing and heartbeat can sometimes be restarted. Events that were causally linked to death in the past no longer kill in all circumstances; without a functioning heart or lungs, life can sometimes be sustained with a combination of life support devices, organ transplants and artificial pacemakers.\n\nToday, where a definition of the moment of death is required, doctors and coroners usually turn to \"brain death\" or \"biological death\" to define a person as being dead; brain death being defined as the complete and irreversible loss of brain function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life).\n\nA near-death experience (NDE) is a personal experience associated with impending death, encompassing multiple possible sensations. Research from neuroscience considers the NDE to be a hallucinatory state caused by various neurological factors such as cerebral anoxia, hypercarbia, abnormal activity in the temporal lobes and brain damage.\n\n"}
{"id": "4900090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4900090", "title": "Drood", "text": "Drood\n\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood (or simply Drood) is a musical based on the unfinished Charles Dickens novel \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\". It is written by Rupert Holmes, and was the first Broadway musical with multiple endings (determined by audience vote). Holmes received Tony Awards for Best Book and Best Original Score. The musical won five Tony Awards out of eleven nominations, including Best Musical and Best Leading Actor.\n\nThe musical debuted as part of the New York Shakespeare Festival in August 1985, and, following revision, transferred to Broadway, where it ran until May 1987. Two national tours and a production in London's West End followed. The Roundabout Theatre Company revived the musical as \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" in 2012.\n\nThe musical \"Drood\" is derived from two major inspirations: Charles Dickens' final (and unfinished) novel, \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\", and the British pantomime and music hall traditions that reached the height of their popularity in the years following Dickens' death.\n\nDickens' \"Mystery\" began publication in 1870. The book, which had been written and published in episodic installments (as had most of Dickens' other novels) was left unfinished upon Dickens' sudden death from a stroke that year. The lack of resolution to the mystery (and the absence of notes that would indicate Dickens' intentions) have made \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" a literary curiosity. Almost immediately after the publication of Dickens' last episode, various authors and playwrights (including Dickens' own son) attempted to resolve the story with their own endings: by the time of the \"Drood\" musical's production, there had been several \"collaborations\" between the late Dickens and other novelists, numerous theatrical extrapolations of the material, and three film adaptations of the story.\n\nContemporaneous with Dickens' writing, British pantomime styles — distinguished by the importance of audience participation and conventions like the principal boy — reached their height of popularity, just as music hall performance with its attributes of raucous, risque comedy and a distinctive style of music began to achieve prominence.\n\nRupert Holmes, who would go on to be the major creative contributor to the musical \"Drood\", spent his early childhood in England. At age three, he would experience theater for the first time when he was taken to a modern \"panto\", complete with cross-dressing lead boy and audience sing-alongs. Some years later, as an 11-year-old boy fascinated by mystery books, Holmes first discovered the unfinished Dickens novel. Both of those seminal experiences would go on to have a major impact on Holmes when he was first approached to write a new musical by impresario Joseph Papp.\n\nHolmes, a well-known popular songwriter whose songs had been performed by the likes of Barbra Streisand, and who had himself recorded the #1 hit \"Escape (The Piña Colada Song)\" in 1979, first became interested in writing a musical in 1983. Following a nightclub appearance during which Holmes performed some of his \"story-songs\" while sharing humorous anecdotes, Holmes received a note from Gail Merrifield, director of play development at the New York Shakespeare Festival (and wife of Joseph Papp, the creator and head of the Festival), who had seen Holmes' performance and suggested that he write a full-length musical.\n\nDrawing on his recollections of pantomime and Dickens' novel, as well as later experiences with Victorian-style music hall performance, Holmes conceived the central premises of the show. From the Dickens work, Holmes took the central plot and most of the featured characters. From music hall traditions, he created the lead character of \"The Chairman\", a sort of Master of Ceremonies and instigator of the action on stage. And from pantomime he retained the concept of the \"Lead Boy\" (always portrayed by a young female in male drag) and the most ground-breaking aspect of \"Drood\", audience participation.\n\n\"Drood\" is unusual in part because of Holmes' feat of writing the book, music, lyrics, and full orchestrations for the show. Though Holmes believed no Broadway creator had done this before, and despite frequent mentions of this feat in articles and reviews of the show, the practice was not entirely uncommon in the early days of musical theater. Songwriters, including Adolf Philipp, were previously credited with the books to their musicals. However, none of these composer/librettists had written their own orchestrations as well.\n\nIn writing the book, Holmes did not let Dickens overshadow his own intentions. Rather than imitate Dickens' writing style, which he felt would be too bleak for the kind of show he wished to write, Holmes employed the device of a \"show-within-a-show.\" The cast members of \"Drood\" do not specifically play Dickens' characters, but rather music hall performers who are performing as Dickens' characters. This device allowed for a great deal of light comedy that was not originally found in Dickens' novel to be incorporated into the show, as well as several musical numbers that were unrelated to the original story. In explaining this decision, Holmes was quoted as saying, \"This is not Nicholas Nickleby set to music--it's not a Dickensian work. It's light and fun and entertaining. But I hope--I think--that Dickens would have enjoyed it.\" Holmes has also pointed out that \"It has the same relationship to Dickens that \"Kiss Me Kate\" does to \"The Taming of the Shrew\".\" The pantomime concept also allowed Holmes to employ a female in the lead male role, which further allowed him to write a love song designed to be sung by two sopranos.\n\nMost inventively, Holmes employed a novel method of determining the outcome of the play: having the audience vote for an ending. At a break in the show, the audience votes on who killed Drood (if, indeed, he was killed at all), the identity of the mysterious Dick Datchery, and on which two characters will become romantically involved in the end, creating a happy ending. Since every audience differs in temperament, the outcome is theoretically unpredictable even to the actors, who must quickly tally the votes and commence with the chosen ending (although some smaller companies will \"fix\" the results to limit the number of possible endings). This device required extra work from Holmes, who had to write numerous short endings which covered every possible voting outcome.\n\nThere are several differences between the musical and the novel. The tone of Dickens' original book was somewhat bleak (as was Dickens' style), whereas the show is considerably more lighthearted and played for comedy. The most notable difference in characterization involves Jasper: though Dickens' character is undoubtedly repressed and troubled, he is not depicted with the full-fledged split personality that he appears to have in the musical. Several minor characters are omitted, and the roles of others are expanded. In the musical, Bazzard is Crisparkle's assistant, whereas in the novel he is employed by Rosa's guardian, Mr. Grewgious. Meanwhile, in order to increase the interactivity of the play and introduce doubt as to who the murderer is, the musical omits several of the novel's clues that Jasper is the killer and introduces clues which do not appear in the novel pointing at other suspects.\n\nAct One opens as the members of the Music Hall Royale circulate among the audience, introducing themselves to the patrons. More and more members of the company add to the growing noise, until the music begins and the Chairman of the proceedings bursts forth with the show’s opening number \"There You Are\". They then introduce John Jasper, the 'Jekyll and Hyde' choirmaster who greets his young nephew Edwin Drood in the song \"Two Kinsmen\", where they express their strong friendship. Drood is engaged to the fair Miss Rosa Bud, who is Jasper’s music pupil and the object of his mad obsession. Rosa's suspicion of his obsession is confirmed when at her next lesson, he asks her to sing a song he has written- \"Moonfall\"- an innuendo-heavy love song from Jasper to her. The kindly Reverend Crisparkle and two exotic emigrants from Ceylon, Helena and Neville Landless, arrive. Neville is immediately attracted to Rosa, which makes him a rival to both Edwin and the secretive Jasper.\n\nNext the chairman brings the audience to London and the sinister opium den of the Princess Puffer who talks with the audience, and explains her life in \"Wages of Sin\". A sinewy ballet dance follows. We discover that one of Puffer’s regular clients is none other than Jasper himself, who cries out the name 'Rosa Bud' during a hallucination. Puffer shows great interest in this fact, and stores it away in her memory. Back in Cloisterham, Neville and Drood meet and come to odds with each other almost immediately.\n\nNext, The Chairman is called in to play another character as that actor is unable to come, but it turned out that the scenes of his character and the scenes of Mayor Sapsea coincide- and the characters have to disagree with each other. This results in major confusion for poor Mayor Sapsea/The Chairman, and laughs for the audience. He and Jasper sing of their conflicting minds- Jasper, of course, meaning it literally- in the patter song \"Both Sides Of The Coin\". We are then introduced to the drunken stonemason Durdles, and his assistant Deputy. In the graveyard, they tell us that Edwin and Rosa, who have been promised to each other since they were children and so cannot tell if they truly love each other, have called off their engagement (\"Perfect Strangers\"). As a parting gift, Rosa gives Drood her hair clasp, which once belonged to her mother.\n\nIt is Christmas Eve and Jasper has arranged a ‘reconciliation’ dinner for the Landless twins, Crisparkle, Rosa and Drood. In the resulting song \"No Good Can Come from Bad\", Neville and Drood's antagonism is reinstated, Helena's and Crisparkle's worry for Neville's reputation is shown, and it is revealed that Crisparkle used to be in love with Rosa's mother, who died after Rosa's birth. Soon the party disbands and the guests depart into a violent storm. There is a short halt here, where the actor playing Bazzard soliloquizes about how he never seems to be able to get a major part in a show in the song \"Never The Luck\".\n\nThe next day Drood has vanished. Crisparkle’s assistant discovers Edwin’s torn coat by the river. Drood was last seen walking there with Neville the night before. Nevile is almost lynched by the townsfolk before being rescued by Crisparkle. Jasper publicly swears to track down his nephew's killer; later he visits Rosa and confesses his love for her. She is horrified and angry, and they sing \"The Name Of Love And Moonfall\", ending with Jasper's pursuing Rosa off-stage as the act concludes.\n\nAct Two begins six months later, and still there is no sign of Drood. There is much speculation as to his fate. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Puffer has been investigating Drood's disappearance, but has also noticed a rather seedy looking figure who seems to be doing the same. It turns out that this man (played by the same actor who plays Drood, normally), Dick Datchery, is a private investigator. They sing \"Settling Up The Score\". The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, \"don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might do you in!\", telling them to think carefully of who they will vote for as the murderer, in the song \"Don't Quit While You're Ahead\". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever. However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is \"not\" chosen as Datchery and exits the theater in a huff. Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast come out and sing \"Don't Quit While You're Ahead\" to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.\n\nPuffer finds Rosa, reveals that years before she had been Rosa's nanny and tells her backstory in the song \"Garden Path To Hell\"; she tells of a man she loved who made her become a prostitute to please his friends and then left her. Once she lost her looks, she found a way to earn money- selling opium. She then continues with \"Puffer's Revelation\" and reveals the identity of Datchery (previously chosen by the audience.) The evening's Datchery (either Bazzard, Reverend Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, or Rosa) explains in their version of the revelation song \"Out On A Limerick\" why they donned the costume and tracked down the killer; the girls did it mainly to disguise their gender, Neville to prove his innocence, Crisparkle to help both Neville and Helena, and Bazzard to give himself both a dramatic reveal and an important character to play. The gist of each song is that the character followed Jasper to his house and found the clasp that Rosa gave Drood, which Jasper would have had only if he had taken it from Drood. Jasper's double nature reveals itself, and he admits that he strangled his nephew while under the influence of the laudanum that he reveals he poured into the wine the night of the dinner party (\"Jasper's Confession\").\n\nDurdles the gravedigger, however, disagrees; he witnessed the crime and knows who truly killed Edwin Drood. Depending on the audience's vote, the finger is pointed at Bazzard, Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, Puffer, Rosa or Durdles. The murderer confesses, then sings a reprise of one of several numbers, beginning with \"A Man Could Go Quite Mad\", to admit his or her culpability; the gist of each of these songs is that the character who killed Drood was seeking to kill \"Jasper\", not Drood, for his or her own purpose- Puffer to protect Rosa, Rosa to save herself, Helena to get revenge on Jasper for ruining her twin's chance at a new beginning, Bazzard to bring himself into the limelight, Neville because he wanted Rosa for himself, and Crisparkle because he killed Rosa's mother out of jealousy and religious mania and wanted to protect both Rosa and Neville from Jasper's evil. However, because of the storm, Jasper had walked with Drood for a while and then given him his coat to wear for the journey home, so the murderer, because of the laudanum in the wine and the foul night weather, mistook Drood for Jasper. (Durdles lacks this motivation, however, so his confession is simply that, in his drunkenness, he mistook Drood for a ghost.) If, although not likely, the audience chooses Jasper as the murderer, Durdles does not interrupt and a second confession is not performed (Some theaters will not count Jasper votes, to make sure that there is a twist).\n\nStill, a happy ending is needed, and the Chairman asks the audience to choose two lovers from among the remaining cast members. The two chosen members declare their love, and then reprise \"Perfect Strangers\". Just then, there comes a noise from the crypt, and a very-much-alive Edwin Drood appears, ready to tell all what really happened on the night of his disappearance (\"The Writing On The Wall\"). What happened was that when Drood was attacked, he was only stunned when he fell and not killed. Jasper dragged him to a crypt where he left him. When Drood woke, he escaped and fled from Cloisterham, only returning so that he could find out who wanted him dead. He sings to the audience, eventually joined by the rest of the cast, imploring them to hold on to life for as long as they possibly can and telling them that 'holding on to life is all.' The mystery is solved, and the show concludes as the cast sings to the audience to read the writing on the wall.\n\nJohn Jasper- Jasper was madly in love with Rosa Bud, and his violent split personality gladly killed Drood. His confession is a reprise of \"A Man Could Go Quite Mad\" and \"Moonfall\". Jasper's confession is performed no matter who is chosen as the murderer, and the audience is discouraged from voting for him since he is the obvious solution. <br> \nRosa Bud- Meant to kill Jasper in revenge for his lustful advances and also due to her own mental instability caused by Jasper's persecution, but killed Drood by accident as Drood was wearing Jasper's coat. Her confession is a reprise of \"A Man Could Go Quite Mad\" and \"No Good Can Come From Bad\" <br>\nNeville Landless- Humiliated by Drood, Neville murdered him in order to regain his pride and also to have a chance with Rosa Bud. His confession is a reprise of \"A Man Could Go Quite Mad\" and \"No Good Can Come From Bad\" in the original Broadway production, later changed to \"A British Subject\" <br>\nHelena Landless- Knowing her brother's hot temper, Helena murdered Drood so Neville would not be tempted to seek revenge. Her confession is a reprise of \"A Man Could Go Quite Mad\" and \"No Good Can Come From Bad\" in the original Broadway production, later changed to \"A British Subject\" <br>\nPrincess Puffer- Intended to kill Jasper in order to protect Rosa from his advances, but accidentally killed Drood because he was wearing Jasper's coat and because she was confused after having smoked opium for Dutch courage. Her confession is a reprise of \"The Wages of Sin\" <br>\nThe Rev. Mr. Crisparkle- Crisparkle was madly in love with Rosa's mother, and he saw Rosa as a reincarnation of her. He murdered Drood so that he could marry Rosa, thinking her to be the woman he loved. This version of Crisparkle's confession was introduced in the first national tour, and has been used in all productions since. His confession is a reprise of \"A Man Could Go Quite Mad\" and \"No Good Can Come From Bad\" in the original Broadway production, later changed to \"A British Subject\". <br>\nBazzard - In an effort to boost his role in the show, murders Drood. This is definitely the most metatheatrical of the endings. His confession is a reprise of \"A Man Could Go Quite Mad\" and \"Never the Luck\" <br>\nDurdles- After Jasper laid Drood in the crypt, Durdles believed the still-alive Drood to be a ghost and so smashed his head in. (Even Durdles admits the silliness of this motive within his solo, but laments that because he has been chosen he must have one.) This solo was not used in the original Broadway production and was added for the first national tour. His confession is a reprise of \"Off to the Races\"\n\nAs \"Drood\" is metatheatrical, the characters of the play \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" are played by actors of the \"Music Hall Royale\", within the production. The following are the dual roles each cast member plays. Note: The actress portraying Miss Alice Nutting/Edwin Drood also performs the role of Dick Datchery up until the Voting portion of the evening. However, as is noted in the script, this is merely a \"bit\" within the context of The Music Hall Royale - that Miss Nutting only portrays Datchery due to a contractual obligation for her to appear in both acts of the play. Ultimately, the audience decides who Dick Datchery is within the confines of Dickens' story.\n\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Not included on the original cast recording\n\n\"†\" Reinstated for the 2012 Broadway revival\n\n§ Moved at the end of Act I for the Tams-Witmark licensed version and the 2012 Broadway revival\n\n\"††\" Moved after \"Settling Up the Score\" for the Tams-Witmark licensed version and the 2012 Broadway revival\n\nFor the version of \"Drood\" that Tams-Witmark licenses to theater companies, Holmes made a variety of changes to the score and libretto, many of which reflect the versions seen in the 1987 London production and the 1988 North American touring production. The numbers \"A Man Could Go Quite Mad,\" \"Ceylon,\" \"Settling Up the Score,\" and the quartet reprise of \"Moonfall\" are not standard but are provided as \"additional material\" that theaters can choose to perform at their options.\n\n\nIn 1985, a recording was made of \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" featuring the original Broadway cast. This recording was released by Polydor with the additional subtitle, \"The Solve-It-Yourself Broadway Musical\" (Polydor 827969) and the CD included versions of \"Out on a Limerick\" by all five possible Datcherys (Rosa, Crisparkle, Bazzard, Neville, and Helena) and all six possible Murderer's Confessions (Puffer, Rosa, Bazzard, Crisparkle, Neville, and Helena), as well as an \"instructional track\" entitled \"A Word From Your Chairman...\" The LP and cassette included only the opening-night Confession and murderer, and omitted the \"lovers.\" A 1990 re-issue of the cast album by Varèse Sarabande (Varèse 5597) included two tracks, \"Ceylon\" and \"Moonfall Quartet\", that are on the original LP and cassette, but not on the CD. It included only Bazzard's version of \"Out on a Limerick\" and two Murderer Confessions (Rosa's and Puffer's). The Polydor recording was briefly available on cassette and LP, and ultimately re-released by Varèse Sarabande. Both versions of the cast album are currently out of print, but can sometimes be found (often at a high price) through secondhand vendors or online auction sites.\n\nAn Australian cast album (GEP Records 9401) was released in 1994. This recording did not include \"Ceylon\" or \"Moonfall Quartet\", but did include three previously unrecorded tracks: \"A British Subject\", \"Puffer's Revelation\", and \"Durdles' Confession\". It should be noted that the Australian cast album was performed by a largely non-professional cast and used (arguably crude) midi sequencing in lieu of a live orchestra. Two songs that were omitted from \"Drood\" before it reached Broadway, \"An English Music Hall\" and \"Evensong,\" (a duet between Rosa and Crisparkle) were later recorded for the 1994 album, \"Lost In Boston\". Other songs that never made into the Broadway or London/'88 Tour (Tams-Witmark) versions include: \"When the Wicked Man Comes\" (sung by a much younger Deputy), \"Sapsea's Song\" (a music hall ditty for Mayor Sapsea), \"I Wouldn't Say No\" (a song and dance routine for Durdles) as well as \"When Shall These Three Meet Again\" - a group number which can be heard as underscoring throughout the show and in the murderer's confession: \"But the night was far from bright...\"\nOn January 29, 2013, a recording featuring the 2012 cast of the Broadway revival was released by DRG Records in a 2-disc set and as a digital download. DRG Records describes the recording as \"the complete musical program on 2 compact discs\" for the first time. Differences between this recording and the original recording include confessions from all eight possible murderers, two versions of \"Out on a Limerick\" (Bazzard and Helena), the lovers' reprise of \"Perfect Strangers\" (featuring a combination of Princess Puffer & Deputy, Helena & Neville, and Rosa & Durdles), a revised \"Ceylon\" (which now incorporates \"A British Subject\"), a previously cut song (\"An English Music Hall\") as the new opening for Act II, and the \"Opium Den Ballet\". Holmes penned the liner notes for the album that will reflect new material and revisions. Holmes also re-orchestrated the production for a 19-piece orchestra led by Paul Gemignani.\n\nAfter Rupert Holmes wrote an initial draft that lasted three-and-a-half hours, and performed it, solo, for Joseph Papp, Gail Merrifield, and Wilford Leach, (the New York Shakespeare Festival's artistic director), Papp offered to produce the show as part of the Festival (also known as \"Shakespeare in the Park\"), and told Holmes that it would be immediately transferred to Broadway if it was deemed a success. The original production of \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" premiered in New York City's Central Park at the Delacorte Theatre on August 21, 1985 after only three weeks of rehearsals. Notably, Holmes conceived most of the orchestrations himself, a rarity for a Broadway composer.\n\nAfter the final Festival performance on September 1, preparations for the Broadway transfer (retaining the original cast) immediately got underway. Following a great deal of editing (the Delacorte version contained 32 original songs and was nearly three hours long) \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" opened on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on December 2, 1985. Roughly halfway through the run, the title of the musical was officially shortened to \"Drood\" (the name it continues to be licensed under). The show ran for 608 performances (not including 24 previews), and closed on May 16, 1987. The Broadway production was produced by Papp and directed by Leach, with choreography by Graciela Daniele.\n\nThe opening night cast of the Broadway production starred George Rose, Cleo Laine, John Herrera, Howard McGillin, Patti Cohenour, and Jana Schneider, who were all nominated for 1986 Tony Awards for their performances, as well as Betty Buckley in the title role. Donna Murphy, Judy Kuhn, and Rob Marshall were also members of the ensemble. (Marshall, who would later become best known as a choreographer and theater/film director, also received an early choreography credit as assistant to Daniele.) Before the show ended its run, Murphy, who was understudy to Cleo Laine and Jana Schneider, took over the title role. Other notable replacements during the show's run included Alison Fraser (taking over for Jana Schneider), Paige O'Hara (taking over for Donna Murphy as Drood), as well as Loretta Swit and later Karen Morrow, who stepped into Laine's roles.\n\nIn 1988, several months after closing on Broadway, a slightly-revised version of \"Drood\", directed by Rob Marshall, began its first North America tour at the Kennedy Center Opera House in Washington, DC, with Rose, Schneider and O'Hara reprising their leads, and Jean Stapleton playing Laine's role. During a break in the tour George Rose returned to his home in the Dominican Republic, and was murdered during his stay. Rose was succeeded by Clive Revill. \n\nThe show, also enjoyed a 1987 West End run at the Savoy Theatre in London, a second U.S. national tour, a production at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, Canada, and numerous regional and professional and amateur theatrical productions worldwide. In 2007–08, a London revival, presented as a chamber piece and directed by Ted Craig, ran at the Warehouse Theatre.\n\nIn 2012 a London West End revival of the musical played at the Arts Theatre for a limited season from 18 May. The cast was headed by Wendi Peters as Princess Puffer, with Natalie Day as Edwin Drood, Daniel Robinson as John Jasper and Victoria Farley as Rosa Budd. The production was directed by Matthew Gould. \n\nThe Roundabout Theatre Company presented a Broadway revival at Studio 54, which opened in November 2012. The production was directed by Scott Ellis, and starred Chita Rivera as Puffer, Stephanie J. Block as Drood, Will Chase as Jasper, Jim Norton as the Chairman and Gregg Edelmann as Crisparkle.\n\nFurther reading\n\n"}

The event commemorated the 51st anniversary of CMLL, which would become the oldest professional wrestling promotion in the world. The Anniversary show is EMLL's biggest show of the year, their Super Bowl event. The main event of the show and one of only two documented matches, was a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" (\"Bet Match\") contested under best two-out-of-three falls rules between Atlantis and Talisman where the loser would be forced to unmask after the match in front of everyone in the arena.\n\nThe 1984 Anniversary show commemorated the 51st anniversary of the Mexican professional wrestling company \"Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre\" (Spanish for \"Mexican Wrestling Promotion\"; EMLL) holding their first show on September 22, 1933 by promoter and founder Salvador Lutteroth. EMLL was rebranded early in 1992 to become \"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\" (\"World Wrestling Council\"; CMLL) signal their departure from the National Wrestling Alliance. With the sales of the Jim Crockett Promotions to Ted Turner in 1988 EMLL became the oldest, still-operating wrestling promotion in the world. Over the years EMLL/CMLL has on occasion held multiple shows to celebrate their anniversary but since 1977 the company has only held one annual show, which is considered the biggest show of the year, CMLL's equivalent of WWE's WrestleMania or their Super Bowl event. CMLL has held their Anniversary show at Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico since 1956, the year the building was completed, over time Arena México earned the nickname \"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\" due to it hosting most of EMLL/CMLL's major events since the building was completed. Traditionally EMLL/CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, replacing their regularly scheduled \"Super Viernes\" show.\n\nThe event featured at least two professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Due to the nature of keeping mainly paper records of wrestling at the time no documentation has been found for the undercard of the show.\n\nIn the first of only two matches that have been documented, Sangre Chicana faced and defeated \"Los Infernales\" team member MS-1 in their Singles match encounter. The main event was the culmination of a long running storyline between the two \"enmascarados\" (\"Masked Wrestlers\") Atlantis and Talisman that started not long after Atlantis joined EMLL in 1984. Atlantis, only in his second year of wrestling at this point in time was targeted by the veteran \"rudo\" Talisman who wanted to show Atlantis his \"proper place\" in the hierarchy of EMLL. The two wrestlers agreed to both put their masks on the line for the 51st Anniversary show, in what was Atlantis first ever \"Lucha de Apuesta\" or \"Bet Match\". In Lucha Libre the \"Luchas de Apuestas\" matches are more significant than championship matches and winning the mask of an opponent usually indicates that the promotion is planning on \"pushing\" that wrestler up to a higher profiled position in the company. The \"rudo\" Talisman cheated his way to victory in the first fall, putting Atlantis in a position where he would have to win two straight falls to win the match. With a performance that had the crowd at Arena México solidly behind him Atlantis managed to pin Talisman in both the second and third fall. After the match Talisman was forced to unmask and reveal that his real name was Arturo Beristain.\n\nA few years after losing the Talisman mask Arturo Beristain would adopt a new \"enmascarado\" (\"Masked\") ring character, using the name El Hijo del Gladiador (\"Son of El Gladiador\"), a storyline relationship as he was not a blood relative of the deceased wrestler El Gladiador.\n"}

Fail-fast systems are usually designed to stop normal operation rather than attempt to continue a possibly flawed process. Such designs often check the system's state at several points in an operation, so any failures can be detected early. The responsibility of a fail-fast module is detecting errors, then letting the next-highest level of the system handle them.\n\nFail-fast systems or modules are desirable in several circumstances:\n\n\nDevelopers also refer to fail-fast code to a code that tries to fail as soon as possible at variable or object initialization. In OOP, a fail-fast designed object initializes the internal state of the object in the constructor, launching an exception if something is wrong (vs allowing non-initialized or partially initialized objects that will fail later due to a wrong \"setter\"). The object can then be made immutable if no more changes to the internal state are expected. In functions, fail-fast code will check input parameters in the precondition. In client-server architectures, fail-fast will check the client request just upon arrival, before processing or redirecting it to other internal components, returning an error if the request fails (incorrect parameters, ...). Fail-fast designed code decreases the internal software entropy, and reduces debugging effort.\n\nFrom the field of software engineering, a Fail Fast Iterator is an iterator that attempts to raise an error if the sequence of elements processed by the iterator is changed during iteration.\n\nThe term has been widely employed as a metaphor in business, dating back to at least 2001, meaning that businesses should undertake bold experiments to determine the longterm viability of a product or strategy, rather than proceeding cautiously and investing years in a doomed approach. It became adopted as a kind of \"mantra\" within startup culture.\n\n\n"}

Founded by the Hungarian pianist and music professor György Sebők in 1974, it is held annually in summer between June and August.\n\nThe idea of a summer music village came about when György Sebők was travelling on holiday with his wife through the Valais Canton. Enamored of the region, Sebök began to spend more time there, and two years later he hosted the first masterclass (Meisterkurs) for piano and chamber music. Over time, the masterclasses and concerts given by his students evolved to become a music festival, which was named Festival der Zukunft (Festival of the Future).

(Guard Leon Hillard was originally planned to be on the series, but was cut out of the cast prior to the start of production.)\n\nThe series worked to a formula where the team travels somewhere and typically get involved in a local conflict that leads to one of the Globetrotters proposing a basketball game to settle the issue. To ensure the Globetrotters' defeat, the villains rig the contest; however, before the second half of the contest, the team always finds a way to even the odds, become all but invincible, and win the game.\n\n22 episodes of \"Harlem Globetrotters\" were eventually produced: 16 for the 1970-71 season, and six more for the 1971-72 season. \"Harlem Globetrotters\" has a place in history as being the first Saturday morning cartoon to feature a predominately African-American cast; Filmation's \"The Hardy Boys\" had been the first to feature an African-American character the previous year. Another Hanna-Barbera series, \"Josie and the Pussycats\", premiered 30 minutes earlier than \"Harlem Globetrotters\" on the same day and network, and was the first Saturday morning cartoon to feature an African-American female character. Like many other Saturday morning cartoons of the era, the first-season episodes utilized a laugh track. By Season Two, the full laugh track was replaced by an inferior version created by the studio.\n\nAfter cancellation the animated Globetrotters made three appearances on Hanna-Barbera's \"The New Scooby-Doo Movies\" in 1972 and 1973. Dribbles, who did not appear on the show, was in the theme song sequence; several references were also made to Granny who also did not appear. Hanna-Barbera produced a second animated series starring the Globetrotters in 1979 called \"The Super Globetrotters\", this time featuring the players as superheroes. In spring 1999, TV Land aired repeats of \"Harlem Globetrotters\" on Saturday mornings as part of its TV Land Super Retrovision Saturdaze lineup. The series has not been rerun since.\n\nThe series was a co-production of Hanna-Barbera and CBS Productions (one of the few animated TV series that CBS directly produced). Syndication rights were originally held by Viacom Enterprises and later Paramount Domestic Television, formerly owned by CBS as its syndication arm. They are currently held by CBS Television Distribution..\n\nIn April 1972, Gold Key Comics launched a comic adaptation of the Harlem Globetrotters animated series; their first comic book appearance was in issue #8 of Gold Key's \"Hanna-Barbera Fun-In\" published in July 1971. Several stories in early issues were based on episodes of the TV show. The comic series lasted for 4 years and 12 issues through January 1975.\n\nA soundtrack album, \"The Globetrotters\", was produced by Jeff Barry and released in 1970 by Kirshner Records (Kirshner #KES-106, distributed by RCA Records), which featured tunes heard in episodes of the series (during the basketball game sequences). Don Kirshner served as music supervisor for both the series and the record. Two singles were generated from this onetime release, a cover of the Neil Sedaka tune \"Rainy Day Bells\" with former Cadillac J.R. Bailey on lead vocals, followed by three non-album singles. Jimmy Radcliffe produced, with Wally Gold, and provided the vocals on \"Duke Of Earl\", \"Everybody's Got Hot Pants\" from the first non-album single and co-wrote and produced \"Everybody Needs Love\" from the second as well providing a number of songs and recordings for the series.\n\nGlobetrotter frontman Meadowlark Lemon was the only member of the team to be actually involved with the project, adding occasional background vocals to some tracks.\n\n(side 2)\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant with seniority from 15 June 1926. He then spent much of his early career attached to the Royal Air Force (which then controlled the naval aviation requirements of the British Armed Forces), interspersed with periods of other naval duties. He continued to receive regular promotions within the RN during this period, to lieutenant on 1 December 1928, and lieutenant-commander on 1 December 1936. Control of naval aviation returned to the Admiralty in 1939.\n\nHe assumed command of No. 825 Squadron Fleet Air Arm in January 1940 which was equipped with Fairey Swordfish aircraft. With the squadron, Buckley operated from HMS \"Glorious\" and from RAF Hal Far on Malta. When the ship was recalled for the operation in Norway, the squadron disembarked at Prestwick and then operated from Worthy Down, Detling and Thorney Island in operations against the advancing German forces in the Low Countries and France.\n\nBuckley was shot down on a bombing raid during the defence of Calais on 29 May 1940 and was captured by the Germans on the same day.\n\nCommand of the squadron was taken over by Lieutenant Commander Eugene Esmonde, who was later to be decorated with the Victoria Cross during an operation with the squadron.\n\nBuckley was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in July 1940 for \"daring, endurance and resource in the conduct of hazardous and successful operations by the Fleet Air Arm working with the Coastal Command in France and over the Channel\". His citation appearing in the London Gazette on 5 July 1940.\n\nBuckley, as an aircrew prisoner, was taken to Dulag Luft transit camp, where he became a member of the permanent British staff at the camp. He arrived at the camp with Squadron Leader Roger Bushell who had also been shot down near Calais on 23 May 1940. Bushell also became a member of the permanent staff.\n\nThe senior British officer (SBO) of the camp was Wing Commander Harry Day. Day appointed Buckley as his adjutant and in October 1940 appointed him as head of the escape committee.\n\nBuckley, with numerous others, participated in the building of three tunnels, of which one was completed and used for an escape in June 1941. Buckley, Day and 16 others escaped, but were all recaptured within a few days. Buckley was caught heading towards the Baltic on a train near Hann Minden. All the recaptured escapers, including Buckley, Bushell and Day, following a brief period in solitary confinement, were transferred to Stalag Luft I at Barth.\n\nAt Stalag Luft I, Day again assumed the role of senior British officer, and again appointed Buckley as head of the escape committee.\n\nBuckley took charge of all escaping operations, and was instrumental in a number of escape attempts, including numerous tunnel projects, although he only made one unsuccessful attempt to escape himself.\n\nThe compound at Barth was becoming overcrowded and, due to the number of escape attempts being made, the German authorities, under directions from Goering, decided to transfer all air force prisoners to a newly built camp at Sagan.\n\nBuckley, with all other POWs from Barth, was transferred to Stalag Luft III in April 1942. The escape organisation remained unchanged with Buckley at is head. To improve security and provide anonymity from the Germans, Buckley became known as 'Big X' – a term later made famous by its use by Roger Bushell and the character based on him, played by Richard Attenborough in the film, \"The Great Escape\".\n\nHe again helped organise numerous escape attempts, including a daring daylight attempt, when two officers cut through the wire under the noses of the sentries. Buckley had organised elaborate diversions, allowing the escapees to cut through to freedom. Unfortunately, both men were recaptured within a few days.\n\nBy October 1942, the compound at Stalag Luft III was becoming overcrowded, and the Germans transferred a number of officers to Oflag XXI-B at Schubin in Northern Poland. Buckley was among the men transferred there. Day went too. Buckley handed over command of the escape organisation at Sagan to Roger Bushell.\n\nThe camp at Schubin was administered by the German Army (the Wehrmacht), and had recently held French POWs. It was dirty and conditions were poor. However, under Day's leadership, morale was very high. Escape attempts almost immediately got under way, once again under Buckley's command. \n\nFollowing a disagreement between the camp commandant and Day (the senior British officer) over camp conditions, Day instigated several tunnel schemes by which a mass escape attempt could be made, with the sole objective of having the commandant removed by the German authorities for failing to prevent a mass break out. \n\nSeveral tunnels were started, the first being finished in March 1943. Buckley, as head of the escape organisation, was given a place in the tunnel. \n\nThe escape took place on the night of 5 March 1943. Buckley, with 34 others (including Day, future MP and journalist Aidan Crawley, journalist/author Robert Kee, German-Jewish RAF pilot Peter Stevens (RAF officer) and Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber) crawled through the 150 ft tunnel, which started from the camp Abort (toilet block). All were recaptured within a few days, except for Buckley and his travelling companion, a young Danish officer Jorgen Thalbitzer (who was using the name Flying Officer Thompson to hide his real identity from the Germans).\n\nBuckley and Thalbitzer are known to have travelled to Copenhagen before attempting a crossing by canoe to neutral Sweden. They never arrived, and their fate is not completely understood. Thalbitzer's body was washed ashore some time later. However, Buckley's body was never found.\n\nHis date of death is recorded as 21 March 1943. He was 38 years old when he died, and is commemorated on the Lee-on-the-Solent Memorial (Bay 4 Panel 24).\nHe was posthumously mentioned in Despatches for his services as a POW. This award was recorded in the \"London Gazette\" dated 4 June 1946.\n\n"}
{"id": "34634300", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34634300", "title": "Kecskemét Animation Film Festival", "text": "Kecskemét Animation Film Festival\n\nKecskemét Animation Film Festival () (KAFF) is an animated film festival held biennially during the month of June in Kecskemét, Hungary. Although the bulk of the festival is oriented toward efforts in Hungarian animation, the associated KAFF-sponsored Festival of European Animated Feature Films and TV Specials () has opened the festival to international works as well. The festival was first held in 1985 and was opened to international works of animation in 1996.\n\nThe history of Hungarian animation has been tied to the city of Kecskemét since 1971 when the Budapest-based state-run monopoly, Pannónia Film Studio, was granted the right to form a subsidiary studio named Kecskeméti Animációs Filmstúdió. For the next two decades Hungarian animation would be produced exclusively in these two cities as well as at a smaller affiliated studio located in Pécs. When state funding evaporated in 1990 and the Pannónia animation monopoly came to an end, the former state-run animation studios found themselves in prime position to become independent commercial entities and in 1991 Kecskeméti Animációs Filmstúdió became Kecskemétfilm Kft under the leadership of Ferenc Mikulás.\n\nThe first Kecskemét Animation Film Festival was held in 1985 during the peak of Hungarian animation efforts. The festival was initially intended as a tri-annual event that would highlight the most notable works of Hungarian animators. Between 1985 and 2005 the event followed this timetable with the only exception being that the festival scheduled for 1991 suffered organization problems related to the fall of Communism in the country and the establishment of the Third Republic, and so the 1991 festival was rescheduled for 1993. From 2005 onward, however, the festival has occurred biennially. In addition, while the main KAFF event remains focused on the works of Hungarian animators, the festival expanded in 1996 to simultaneously coordinate an affiliated event, the Festival of European Animated Feature Films and TV Specials (also known as the International Festival of Animated Feature Films and TV Specials). The two festivals are part of the same event and are considered synonymous.\n\nEach festival has two kinds of juries. The preselection jury consists of 3 people who screen the possible submissions to come up with the initial quality lineup for the festival. The selection jury consists of a 3 to 5 person team who are charged with determining which of these films is to be awarded prizes. Since the 5th International Festival of Animated Feature Films and TV Specials in 2007, a separate set of jurymen (including 3 preselection and 3-5 regular jury) have been used to select films and award prizes for the international portion of the event. Appointment of all jury members is done by KAFF staff and until 2005 both juries may have had a president/chairperson. This position was usually given to guests as a form of high honor. Since the 4th KAFF in 1996, the composition of the jury has been decidedly international with guests since then hailing from Russia, Japan, Canada, USA, South Korea, and over a dozen other countries from all over Europe.\n\nFormer jury presidents/chairpeople have included:\n\nKAFF and Festival of European Animated Feature Films and TV Specials prizes are generally of 2 types—Special Awards and Category Awards. Top Prizes are also awarded as well as Memorial Awards and a variety of other miscellaneous prizes. For top prizes, recipients may also be entitled to monetary prizes. The number of prizes awarded has gradually risen from 11 prizes in 1985 to over 25 in the late 2000s. Commonly awarded prizes include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51989431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51989431", "title": "Mike Cernovich", "text": "Mike Cernovich\n\nMichael Cernovich (born November 17, 1977) is an American alt-right social media personality, writer, and conspiracy theorist. Cernovich rejects the label alt-right, describing himself as \"new right\". The Southern Poverty Law Center has identified him as a male supremacist.\n\nRaised into a poor family in Kewanee, Illinois, Cernovich studied through the University of Illinois system and then the Pepperdine University School of Law. He began blogging in the 2000s, focusing on anti-feminist themes and becoming known within the manosphere. His website, \"Danger and Play\", known originally for its men's rights advocacy, was created in 2012. During the 2016 US presidential election campaign, it evolved into a largely pro-Donald Trump and anti-Hillary Clinton political blog.\n\nCernovich often promotes fake news, conspiracy theories, and smear campaigns, including Pizzagate, the false theory that John Podesta and other high-ranking Democratic Party officials were involved in a child-sex ring. Cernovich currently serves as a regular host of \"The Alex Jones Show\" on InfoWars, a show that promotes fake news and conspiracy theories. Cernovich has on multiple occasions falsely accused various journalists and anti-Trump figures of being pedophiles or being supportive of pedophilia.\n\nCernovich was born on November 17, 1977. He grew up in a devout Christian family in the farming town of Kewanee, Illinois. The family was poor, and his mother suffered from mental illness and spent time in an institution. He graduated from the University of Illinois system and later from the Pepperdine University School of Law.\n\nIn 2004, Cernovich started a legal weblog entitled Crime & Federalism, and his blog was selected for syndication by American Lawyer Media.\n\nIn his early writings Cernovich focused on antifeminism, men's empowerment, and how to meet women. The title of Danger and Play came from a quote by Friedrich Nietzsche, \"The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.\" In 2014, Cernovich promoted Gamergate, a controversy during which several women in the video game industry were targeted by Internet trolls, goading opponents with tweets such as \"Who cares about breast cancer and rape? Not me.\"\n\nIn 2015, Cernovich wrote a self-published self-help book, \"Gorilla Mindset\". In 2016, he tweeted, \"Women love aggressive men, but only if they are alpha males.\" According to \"The New York Times\" in April 2017, Cernovich has long been criticized for arguing that date rape is a \"harmful concept for men and women.\" He saw Donald Trump as a kindred spirit and began to engage in political commentary.\n\nCernovich had previously – in early 2006 – published an article deriding Trump on Crime & Federalism. The piece referred to the billionaire as a \"media whore\" who \"casts his image to the world on demand and recasts it constantly to suit everchanging ratings and marketing schemes,\" and advised to \"never trust a man who combs his hair so as to cover his shiny dome, and then flaunts a wife young enough to be his daughter.\"\n\nCernovich became influential on social media, initially as part of the manosphere movement, and more recently has helped to shape far-right narratives in the United States. He falsely claimed during the 2016 United States presidential election that Hillary Clinton had a \"seizure disorder\" and Parkinson's disease. By September his #HillarysHealth hashtag had gotten 240,000 page views and had become a national trending topic on Twitter. During the month of September, Cernovich's tweets were seen more than 100 million times.\n\nCernovich frequently calls his adversaries \"cucks\", a variant of the alt-right slang word cuckservative, a pejorative term for conservatives who supposedly betray conservative social values. In reference to this he has written, \"To beat a person, you lower his or her social status. Logic is pointless.\" Cernovich admits to sometimes using trolling tactics, which he says he uses to build his brand rather than for his own amusement.\n\nCernovich helped popularize the false Pizzagate conspiracy theory through his blog posts and believes that child sex rings run rampant in Washington, D.C. He has accused his opponents of being pedophiles on multiple occasions, and in a YouTube video maintained that most people employed by the news media and \"every A-list actor\" in Hollywood were also pedophiles.\n\nIn October 2016 Cernovich said:\n\n\"The left likes to talk about power structures, right? Well, the media still thinks of itself as speaking truth to power. What they don't realize is that someone like me is perceived as the new Fourth Estate. Maybe they should check their structural privilege.\" The \"paternalistic\" media, he said, was giving way to a more democratic one. \"It makes journalists crazy, because they used to be in control. They can't control people anymore. Everyone has a voice now.\"\n\nFollowing an August 2016 appearance on Fox News's \"Red Eye\", the show's producers felt compelled afterwards to say that they had made a mistake in booking him when later learning of Cernovich's history of online disputes.\n\nCernovich has accused the Democratic Party of attempting to assassinate him. In 2016, Cernovich criticized Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for speaking at a gender-segregated mosque. \n\nIn August 2017, the Anti-Defamation League accused Cernovich of commissioning and publishing a \"blatantly anti-Semitic cartoon\" by Ben Garrison as part of a campaign against President Donald Trump's national security adviser.\n\nIn November 2017, Cernovich spread misinformation linking the Sutherland Springs church shooting to Antifa.\n\nIn August 2012 Cernovich wrote that date rape \"does not exist\". In October 2016 he wrote, \"Lying about being in love to sleep with someone isn't rape. Getting played isn't rape. Regret isn't rape. Thinking, 'I might have been date raped,' means you weren't raped.\"\nIn mid-November 2017, Cernovich offered $10,000 for information about congressional sexual harassment settlements. The next week, he sent documents concerning a case settled by John Conyers to BuzzFeed, which vetted them and reported on them. Cernovich encouraged all victims of sexual assault by congressmen to speak up and offered to cover their legal expenses.\n\nIn December 2017, Cernovich hosted an \"Ask Me Anything\" on Reddit. The \"AMA\", regarded as a failure by several media outlets, was dominated by users mocking him and asking questions about the rape allegations against him, his advice to men to nonconsensually expose their genitalia and masturbate in front of women who are unwilling to engage in sexual acts, and a supposed sexual encounter with a male-to-female transgender individual in Thailand (which Cernovich denied). A few days later, he announced his intention to retire from social media, but reversed the decision within hours.\n\nIn July 2018, he publicized historical tweets in which director James Gunn, a critic of Trump, had joked about rape and pedophilia; Gunn was fired by Disney as a result. Cernovich has made a number of tweets about rape, including comments that \"date rape does not exist\" and that \"A whore will let her friend ruin your life with a false rape case. So why should I care when women are raped?\"\n\nAccording to Politico website, during the 2016 campaign and early period of the Trump administration, Cernovich was an \"indefatigable Trump cheerleader\", hoping that he and kindred activists would have a major influence on the Republican Party. However, by 2018, he had become \"increasingly critical\" of Trump, and turning away from politics toward his “Gorilla Mindset” lifestyle-coaching practice. In September 2018, he tweeted, “There’s no Wall. She’s not locked up. But Flynn got fired and sent to wolves. And Sauadi [sic] Arabia sold weapons of murder. I give zero f-cks about Republicans losing the House.” Cernovich complimented democratic socialist (and Trump critic) Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on her primary election upset of New York Congressman Joe Crowley: “She just slaughtered fucking Crowley, just slaughtered the machine, and now she’s like the ‘it’ girl, ... I like to watch peak human achievement.”\n\nFollowing the 2018 missile strikes against Syria – which were criticized by Cernovich and split Trump's political base – he announced that he would pivot to \"philosophy\" and more esoteric content. Cernovich claimed that he had felt a \"cosmic\" \"shift in energy\" which only \"high-consciousness people\" were able to experience. He also elaborated on his past use of mind-altering drugs and referred to reality as a \"simulation\" several times.\n\nOn November 28, 2017, Cernovich published a post on Medium which resurfaced a deleted 2009 tweet made by progressive talk radio host and MSNBC political commentator Sam Seder, in which he joked about convicted child rapist and fugitive film director Roman Polanski. The tweet read, \"Don't care re Polanski, but I hope if my daughter is ever raped it is by an older truly talented man w/ a great sense of mise en scène.\" Cernovich insisted the tweet proved Seder tacitly endorsed Polanski's pedophilia. He then approached multiple journalists and news outlets, including MSNBC, to break the story.\n\nDespite explaining the tweet to MSNBC Senior VP of Communications Errol Cockfield Jr. via email, on December 4, 2017, TheWrap announced that MSNBC had elected to sever ties with Seder by not renewing his contract (due to expire in February 2018) due to the controversial tweet. Seder defended the tweet by pointing out that, taken in context of the current events around the time he posted it, it was a satiric response to a petition urging Polanski's release from detention in Switzerland. That he was, in fact, mocking Polanski's apologists. After news of the termination broke, Cernovich released a Twitter video celebrating his triumph.\n\nBy then, Seder noted that advertisers on \"The Majority Report with Sam Seder\" podcast were also being contacted and pressured by Cernovich and his team to cut ties with the show over the tweet. In response, Seder launched a GoFundMe campaign to ensure the show is funded if the advertisers decided to bail. In an episode of the podcast titled, \"I'm Under Attack By the Nazi Alt-Right\", Seder said, \"this smear involves the willful misinterpretation of a tweet that I posted in 2009\" and that he will \"never be ashamed of criticizing those who would excuse the predation of women or girls.\" Seder also revealed plans to use a portion of the GoFundMe proceeds to produce a three-minute video educating people on Cernovich's tactics. He surmised this was retribution for his frequent criticism of US President Donald Trump as well as Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Further, Seder chided MSNBC's decision to terminate his employment concluding, \"I think they're afraid of those people.\"\nThe news of Seder's dismissal received immediate backlash. Over 12,000 people signed a petition protesting Seder's termination, arguing that Cernovich had acted in malice and was deliberately mischaracterizing the tweet. Multiple news publications pilloried MSNBC. MSNBC primetime anchor Chris Hayes tweeted, \"The entire culture and our politics are now dominated by people who have weaponized bad faith and shamelessness.\" Hayes tweeted several times against the decision by his own network, including: \"Also, I reiterate my longstanding position that people shouldn't be fired for a tweet, *particularly* one that is obviously being read in manifestly bad faith.\" Actress Sarah Silverman also tweeted in support of Seder.\n\nThere was considerable dissent within MSNBC over the termination. Employees worried firing Seder incentivized other far-right personalities to launch similar campaigns. MSNBC's management itself was unsettled by the celebratory reaction from the far-right. On December 7, 2017, MSNBC decided to reverse their decision to terminate Seder's employment. MSNBC President Phil Griffin said in a statement, \"Sometimes you just get one wrong, and that's what happened here. We made our initial decision for the right reasons—because we don't consider rape to be a funny topic to be joked about. But we've heard the feedback, and we understand the point Sam was trying to make in that tweet was actually in line with our values, even though the language was not. Sam will be welcome on our air going forward.\" In response, Seder issued a statement while accepting his job back:\n\nColumbia Journalism Review cited the incident as an example of a broader pattern of far-right media personalities using online smear campaigns to get mainstream journalists fired. Cernovich, for his part, acknowledged that \"some are saying Seder was making a joke or being sarcastic.\" However, he still insisted he didn't misrepresent the tweet. He later admitted that the whole incident was a stunt while claiming victory explaining, retroactively, it was meant to bring attention to what he perceived was a double standard and a lack of \"diversity of viewpoint\" in the media, He also tweeted that he was \"thrilled\" MSNBC offered Seder his job back while threatening to \"bring Sam Seder's Tweet out every time the media goes after someone else for a Tweet.\" On December 9, 2017, having failed to get Seder fired, Cernovich claimed that his wife was being stalked at the behest of the media.\n\nAlthough describing himself as politically center-right, he supports single-payer healthcare and \"some form of universal basic income\". Cernovich advocates IQ-testing for all immigrants and ending federal funding of universities. He opposes the two-party system and his support for Trump is not based on public policy. \"What are Trump's policies? I don't particularly care\". In another post on his website he stated, \"If Trump offends you, it's because you live in a cucked world where no one speaks their minds\".\n\nVarious press sources have labelled Cernovich as being part of the alt-right movement; a label that Cernovich has rejected. In his study of the alt-right, the political scientist George Hawley also disputed this characterization, stating that Cernovich \"might be properly labelled\" as \"alt-lite\". Similarly, the commentator Angela Nagle described Cernovich as a \"major figure in the alt-light milieu\".\n\nIn April 2017, Cernovich promoted the conspiracy theory that the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack in Syria was a hoax funded by an American financier.\n\nIn a February 2012 blog post, Cernovich argued that men should not \"settle for the make out. If possible, at least pull out your dick. If you can get her to touch it, even better\" and promoted masturbation in front of women reluctant to engage in sex.\n\nCernovich has been supportive of a universal basic income within the United States, claiming that \"Conservatism is on the way out\" regarding national social programmes. Interviewed on \"60 Minutes\" in March 2017, where he also advocated for single-payer healthcare, he said if \"a large swath of the company, or country, are suffering, then I think that we owe it to all Americans to do right by them and to help them out.\"\n\nCernovich believes in the white genocide conspiracy theory, saying that \"white genocide is real\" in relation to South Africa. He has stated that he initially joined the alt-right after realizing that \"tolerance only went one way and diversity is code for white genocide\". He later deleted several tweets referring to the concept.\n\nCernovich married his first wife as a law student in 2003. Cernovich has said the marriage was \"ruined by feminist indoctrination\". His wife became an attorney in Silicon Valley and earned millions of dollars from an initial public offering of stock. She filed for divorce in 2011, and Cernovich received what he has described as a \"seven-figure sum\" in the settlement. Cernovich met his second wife shortly thereafter, and lives outside of Los Angeles, California.\n\nDuring an interview with his wife, when referring to his feelings about becoming a father to a baby girl, Cernovich said, \"I’ll be nice to her, as long as she’s not a basic bitch.\"\n\nCernovich was charged with and arrested for rape in 2003, but he denied the allegations. The charge related to this incident was later reduced to misdemeanor battery of a woman, for which he performed community service.\n"}

When positive, such experiences may encompass a variety of sensations including detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth, the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of a light. When negative, such experiences may include sensations of torment and torture. NDEs are a recognized part of some transcendental and religious beliefs in an afterlife.\n\nDifferent models have been described to explain NDEs. Neuroscience research suggests that an NDE is a subjective phenomenon resulting from \"disturbed bodily multisensory integration\" that occurs during life-threatening events.\n\nThe equivalent French term \"expérience de mort imminente\" (experience of imminent death) was proposed by the French psychologist and epistemologist Victor Egger as a result of discussions in the 1890s among philosophers and psychologists concerning climbers' stories of the panoramic life review during falls. In 1892 a series of subjective observations by workers falling from scaffolds, war soldiers who suffered injuries, climbers who had fallen from heights or other individuals who had come close to death (near drownings, accidents) was reported by Albert Heim. This was also the first time the phenomenon was described as clinical syndrome. In 1968 Celia Green published an analysis of 400 first-hand accounts of out-of-body experiences. This represented the first attempt to provide a taxonomy of such experiences, viewed simply as anomalous perceptual experiences, or hallucinations. In 1969, Swiss-American psychiatrist and pioneer in near-death studies Elisabeth Kubler-Ross published her groundbreaking book \"On Death and Dying: What the dying have to teach doctors, nurses, clergy, and their own families.\" These experiences were also popularized by the work of psychiatrist Raymond Moody, who in 1975 coined the term \"near-death experience\" (NDE) as an umbrella term for the different elements (out of body experiences, the \"panoramic life review,\" the Light, the tunnel, or the border). The term \"near-death experience\" had already been used by John C. Lilly in 1972.\n\nResearchers have identified the common elements that define near-death experiences. Bruce Greyson argues that the general features of the experience include impressions of being outside one's physical body, visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, and transcendence of egotic and spatiotemporal boundaries. Many common elements have been reported, although the person's interpretation of these events often corresponds with the cultural, philosophical, or religious beliefs of the person experiencing it. For example, in the US, where 46% of the population believes in guardian angels, they will often be identified as angels or deceased loved ones (or will be unidentified), while Hindus will often identify them as messengers of the god of death.\n\nCommon traits that have been reported by NDErs are as follows:\n\nKenneth Ring (1980) subdivided the NDE on a five-stage continuum. The subdivisions were:\n\nCharlotte Martial, a neuropsychologist from the University of Liège and University Hospital of Liège who led a team that investigated 154 NDE cases, concluded that there is not a fixed sequence of events.\n\nKenneth Ring argues that attempted suicides do not lead more often to unpleasant NDEs than unintended near-death situations.\n\nNDEs are associated with changes in personality and outlook on life. Ring has identified a consistent set of value and belief changes associated with people who have had a near-death experience. Among these changes, he found a greater appreciation for life, higher self-esteem, greater compassion for others, less concern for acquiring material wealth, a heightened sense of purpose and self-understanding, desire to learn, elevated spirituality, greater ecological sensitivity and planetary concern, and a feeling of being more intuitive. However, not all after-effects are beneficial and Greyson describes circumstances where changes in attitudes and behavior can lead to psychosocial and psychospiritual problems.\n\nNDEs have been recorded since ancient times. The oldest known medical report of near-death experiences was written by Pierre-Jean du Monchaux, an 18th century French military doctor who described such a case in his book \"Anecdotes de Médecine.\" In the 19th century a few studies moved beyond individual cases - one privately done by the Mormons and one in Switzerland. Up to 2005, 95% of world cultures are known to have made some mention of NDEs.\n\nA number of more contemporary sources report incidences of near death experiences of:\n\nBruce Greyson (psychiatrist), Kenneth Ring (psychologist), and Michael Sabom (cardiologist), helped to launch the field of near-death studies and introduced the study of near-death experiences to the academic setting. From 1975 to 2005, some 2,500 self-reported individuals in the US had been reviewed in retrospective studies of the phenomena with an additional 600 outside the US in the West, and 70 in Asia. Additionally, prospective studies had identified 270 individuals. Prospective studies review groups of individuals (e.g., selected emergency room patients) and then find who had an NDE during the study's time; such studies cost more to perform. In all, close to 3,500 individual cases between 1975 and 2005 had been reviewed in one or another study. All these studies were carried out by some 55 researchers or teams of researchers.\n\nMelvin Morse, head of the Institute for the Scientific Study of Consciousness, and colleagues have investigated near-death experiences in a pediatric population.\n\nIn 2001, Sam Parnia and colleagues published the results of a year-long study of cardiac arrest survivors that was conducted at Southampton General Hospital. 63 survivors were interviewed. They had been resuscitated after being clinically dead with no pulse, no respiration, and fixed dilated pupils. Parnia and colleagues investigated out-of-body experience claims by placing figures on suspended boards facing the ceiling, not visible from the floor. Four had experiences that, according to the study criteria, were NDEs but none of them experienced the out-of-body experience. Thus, they were not able to identify the figures.\n\nPsychologist Chris French wrote regarding the study \"unfortunately, and somewhat atypically, none of the survivors in this sample experienced an OBE\".\n\nIn 2001 Pim van Lommel, a cardiologist from the Netherlands, and his team conducted a study on NDEs including 344 cardiac arrest patients who had been successfully resuscitated in 10 Dutch hospitals. Patients not reporting NDEs were used as controls for patients who did, and psychological (e.g. fear before cardiac arrest), demographic (e.g. age, sex), medical (e.g. more than one cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)) and pharmacological data were compared between the 2 groups. The work also included a longitudinal study where the 2 groups (those who had had an NDE and those who had not had one) were compared at 2 and 8 years, for life changes. One patient had a conventional out of body experience. He reported being able to watch and recall events during the time of his cardiac arrest. His claims were confirmed by hospital personnel. \"This did not appear consistent with hallucinatory or illusory experiences, as the recollections were compatible with real and verifiable rather than imagined events\".\n\nWhile at University of Southampton, Parnia was the principal investigator of the AWARE Study, which was launched in 2008. This study which concluded in 2012 included 33 investigators across 15 medical centers in the UK, Austria and the US and tested consciousness, memories and awareness during cardiac arrest. The accuracy of claims of visual and auditory awareness was examined using specific tests. One such test consisted in installing shelves, bearing a variety of images and facing the ceiling, hence not visible by hospital staff, in rooms where cardiac-arrest patients were more likely to occur. The results of the study were published in October 2014; both the launch and the study results were widely discussed in the media.\n\nA review article analyzing the results reports that, out of 2060 cardiac arrest events, 101 of 140 cardiac arrest survivors could complete the questionnaires. Of these 101 patients 9% could be classified as near death experiences. 2 more patients (2% of those completing the questionnaires) described \"seeing and hearing actual events related to the period of cardiac arrest\". These two patients' cardiac arrests did not occur in areas equipped with ceiling shelves hence no images could be used to objectively test for visual awareness claims. One of the two patients was too sick and the accuracy of her recount could not be verified. For the second patient instead, it was possible to verify the accuracy of the experience and to show that awareness occurred paradoxically some minutes after the heart stopped, at a time when \"the brain ordinarily stops functioning and cortical activity becomes isoelectric.\" The experience was not compatible with an illusion, imaginary event or hallucination since visual (other than of ceiling shelves' images) and auditory awareness could be corroborated.\n\n, a posting at the UK Clinical Trials Gateway website described plans for AWARE II, a two-year multicenter observational study of 900-1500 patients experiencing cardiac arrest, which said that subject recruitment had started on 1 August 2014 and that the scheduled end date was 31 May 2017. The study was extended, and it is currently expected to end in 2020.\n\nIn a review article, psychologist Chris French has grouped approaches to explain NDEs in three broad groups which \"are not distinct and independent, but instead show considerable overlap\": spiritual theories (also called transcendental), psychological theories, and physiological theories that provide a physical explanation for NDEs.\n\nFrench summarizes this model by saying : \"the most popular interpretation is that the NDE is exactly what it appears to be to the person having the experience\". The NDE would then represent evidence of the supposedly immaterial existence of a soul or mind, which would leave the body upon death. An NDE would then provide information about an immaterial world where the soul would journey upon ending its physical existence on earth.\n\nAccording to Greyson some NDE phenomena cannot be easily explained with our current knowledge of human physiology and psychology. For instance, at a time when they were unconscious patients could accurately describe events as well as report being able to view their bodies \"from an out-of-body spatial perspective\". In two different studies of patients who had survived a cardiac arrest, those who had reported leaving their bodies could describe accurately their resuscitation procedures or unexpected events, whereas others \"described incorrect equipment and procedures\". Sam Parnia also refers to two cardiac arrest studies and one deep hypothermic circulatory arrest study where patients reported visual and/or auditory awareness occurring when their brain function had ceased. These reports \"were corroborated with actual and real events\".\n\nFive prospective studies have been carried out, to test the accuracy of out of body perceptions by placing \"unusual targets in locations likely to be seen by persons having NDEs, such as in an upper corner of a room in the emergency department, the coronary care unit, or the intensive care unit of a hospital.\" Twelve patients reported leaving their bodies, but unfortunately none could describe the hidden visual targets. Although this is a small sample, the failure of purported out-of-body experiencers to describe the hidden targets raises questions about the accuracy of the anecdotal reports described above.\n\nPsychologist James Alcock has described the afterlife claims of NDE researchers as pseudoscientific. Alcock has written the spiritual or transcendental interpretation \"is based on belief in search of data rather than observation in search of explanation.\" Chris French has noted that \"the survivalist approach does not appear to generate clear and testable hypotheses. Because of the vagueness and imprecision of the survivalist account, it can be made to explain any possible set of findings and is therefore unfalsifiable and unscientific.\"\n\nFrench summarises the main psychological explanations which include: the depersonalization, the expectancy and the dissociation models.\n\nA depersonalization model was proposed in the 1970s by professor of psychiatry Russell Noyes and clinical psychologist Roy Kletti, which suggested that the NDE is a form of depersonalization experienced under emotional conditions such as life-threatening danger, potentially inescapable danger, and that the NDE can best be understood as an hallucination. According to this model, those who face their impending death become detached from the surroundings and their own bodies, no longer feel emotions, and experience time distortions.\n\nThis model suffers from a number of limitations to explain NDEs for subjects who do not experience a sensation of being out of their bodies; unlike NDEs, experiences are dreamlike, unpleasant and characterized by \"anxiety, panic and emptiness\". Also, during NDEs subjects remain very lucid of their identities, their sense of identify is not changed unlike those experiencing depersonalization.\n\nAnother psychological theory is called the expectancy model. It has been suggested that although these experiences could appear very real, they had actually been constructed in the mind, either consciously or subconsciously, in response to the stress of an encounter with death (or perceived encounter with death), and did not correspond to a real event. In a way, they are similar to wish-fulfillment: because someone thought they were about to die, they experienced certain things in accordance with what they expected or wanted to occur. Imagining a heavenly place was in effect a way for them to soothe themselves through the stress of knowing that they were close to death. Subjects use their own personal and cultural expectations to imagine a scenario that would protect them against an imminent threat to their lives.\n\nSubjects' accounts often differed from their own \"religious and personal expectations regarding death\" which contradicts the hypothesis they may have imagined a scenario based on their cultural and personal background.\n\nAlthough the term NDE was first coined in 1975 and the experience first described then, recent descriptions of NDEs do not differ from those reported earlier than 1975. The only exception is the more frequent description of a tunnel. Hence, the fact that information about these experiences could be more easily obtained after 1975, did not influence people's reports of the experiences.\n\nAnother flaw of this model can be found in children's accounts of NDEs. These are similar to adults', and this despite children being less affected by religious or cultural influences about death.\n\nThe dissociation model proposes that NDE is a form of withdrawal to protect an individual from a stressful event. Under extreme circumstances some people may detach from certain unwanted feelings in order to avoid experiencing their emotional impact and suffering associated with them. The person also detaches from one's immediate surroundings.\n\nThe birth model suggests that near death experiences could be a form of reliving the trauma of birth. Since a baby travels from the darkness of the womb to light and is greeted by the love and warmth of the nursing and medical staff, and so, it was proposed, the dying brain could be recreating the passage through a tunnel to light, warmth and affection.\n\nReports of leaving the body through a tunnel are equally frequent among subjects who were born by cesarean section and natural birth. Also, newborns do not possess \"the visual acuity, spatial stability of their visual images, mental alertness, and cortical coding capacity to register memories of the birth experience\".\n\nA wide range of physiological theories of the NDE have been put forward including those based upon cerebral hypoxia, anoxia, and hypercapnia; endorphins and other neurotransmitters; and abnormal activity in the temporal lobes.\n\nNeurobiological factors in the experience have been investigated by researchers in the field of medical science and psychiatry. Among the researchers and commentators who tend to emphasize a naturalistic and neurological base for the experience are the British psychologist Susan Blackmore (1993), with her \"dying brain hypothesis\".\n\nNeuroscientists Olaf Blanke and Sebastian Dieguez (2009), from the \"Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne\", Switzerland, propose a brain based model with two types of NDEs : \nThey suggest that damage to the bilateral occipital cortex may lead to visual features of NDEs such as seeing a tunnel or lights, and \"damage to unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe structures such as the hippocampus and amygdala\" may lead to emotional experiences, memory flashbacks or a life review. They concluded that future neuroscientific studies are likely to reveal the neuroanatomical basis of the NDE which will lead to the demystification of the subject without needing paranormal explanations.\n\nFrench has written that the \"temporal lobe is almost certain to be involved in NDEs, given that both damage to and direct cortical stimulation of this area are known to produce a number of experiences corresponding to those of the NDE, including OBEs, hallucinations, and memory flashbacks\".\n\nVanhaudenhuyse \"et al\". 2009 reported that recent studies employing deep brain stimulation and neuroimaging have demonstrated that out-of-body experiences result from a deficient multisensory integration at the temporoparietal junction and that ongoing studies aim to further identify the functional neuroanatomy of near-death experiences by means of standardized EEG recordings.\nAccording to Greyson multiple neuroanatomical models have been proposed where NDEs have been hypothesized to originate from different anatomical areas of the brain, namely: the limbic system, the hippocampus, the left temporal lobe, Reissen's fiber in the central canal of the spinal cord, the prefrontal cortex, the right temporal lobe.\n\nBlanke et al. admit that their model remains speculative to the lack of data. Likewise Greyson writes that although some or any of the neuroanatomical models proposed may serve to explain NDEs and pathways through which they are expressed, they remain speculative at this stage since they have not been tested in empirical studies.\n\nSome theories hypothesize that drugs used during resuscitation induced NDEs, for example, ketamine or as resulting from endogeneous chemicals that transmit signals between brain cells, neurotransmitters:\n\nAccording to Parnia, neurochemical models are not backed by data. This is true for \"NMDA receptor activation, serotonin, and endorphin release\" models. Parnia writes that no data has been collected via thorough and careful experimentation to back \"a possible causal relationship or even an association\" between neurochemical agents and NDE experiences.\n\nThe first formal neurobiological model for NDE, included endorphins, neurotransmitters of the limbic system, the temporal lobe and other parts of the brain. Extensions and variations of their model came from other scientists such as Louis Appleby (1989).\n\nOther authors suggest that all components of near-death experiences can be explained in their entirety via psychological or neurophysiological mechanisms, although the authors admit that these hypotheses have to be tested by science.\n\nLow oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxia or anoxia) have been hypothesized to induce hallucinations and hence possibly explain NDEs. This is because low oxygen levels characterize life-threatening situations and also by the apparent similarities between NDEs and G-force induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) episodes.\n\nThese episodes are observed with fighter pilots experiencing very rapid and intense acceleration that result in lack of sufficient blood supply to the brain. Whinnery studied almost 1000 cases and noted how the experiences often involved \"tunnel vision and bright lights, floating sensations, automatic movement, autoscopy, OBEs, not wanting to be disturbed, paralysis, vivid dreamlets of beautiful places, pleasurable sensations, psychological alterations of euphoria and dissociation, inclusion of friends and family, inclusion of prior memories and thoughts, the experience being very memorable (when it can be remembered), confabulation, and a strong urge to understand the experience.\"\n\nHowever, hypoxia-induced acceleration's primary characteristics are \"rythmic jerking of the limbs, compromised memory of events just prior to the onset of unconsciousness, tingling of extremities ...\" that are not observed during NDEs. Also G-LOC episodes do not feature life reviews, mystical experiences and \"long-lasting transformational aftereffects\", although this may be due to the fact that subjects have no expectation of dying.\n\nAlso, hypoxic hallucinations are characterized by \"distress and agitation\" and this is very different from near death experiences which subjects report as being pleasant.\n\nSome investigators have studied whether hypercarbia or higher than normal carbon dioxide levels, could explain the occurrence of NDEs. However, studies are difficult to interpret since NDEs have been observed both with increased levels as well as decreased levels of carbon dioxide, and finally some other studies have observed NDEs when levels had not changed, and there is little data.\n\nFrench said that at least some reports of NDEs might be based upon false memories.\n\nAccording to Engmann (2008) near-death experiences of people who are clinically dead are psychopathological symptoms caused by a severe malfunction of the brain resulting from the cessation of cerebral blood circulation. An important question is whether it is possible to \"translate\" the bloomy experiences of the reanimated survivors into psychopathologically basic phenomena, e.g., acoasms (nonverbal auditory hallucinations), central narrowing of the visual field, autoscopia, visual hallucinations, activation of limbic and memory structures according to Moody's stages. The symptoms suppose a primary affliction of the occipital and temporal cortices under clinical death. This basis could be congruent with the thesis of pathoclisis—the inclination of special parts of the brain to be the first to be damaged in case of disease, lack of oxygen, or malnutrition—established eighty years ago by Cécile and Oskar Vogt.\n\nProfessor of neurology Terence Hines (2003) claimed that near-death experiences are hallucinations caused by cerebral anoxia, drugs, or brain damage.\n\nGregory Shushan published an analysis of the afterlife beliefs of five ancient civilisations (Old and Middle Kingdom Egypt, Sumerian and Old Babylonian Mesopotamia, Vedic India, pre-Buddhist China, and pre-Columbian Mesoamerica) and compared them with historical and contemporary reports of near-death experiences, and shamanic afterlife \"journeys\". Shushan found similarities across time, place, and culture that he found could not be explained by coincidence; he also found elements that were specific to cultures; Shushan concludes that some form of mutual influence between experiences of an afterlife and culture probably influence one another and that this inheritance in turn influences individual NDEs. In contrast, it has been argued that near-death experiences and many of their elements (vision of God, judgment, the tunnel, or the life review) are closely related to religious and spiritual traditions of the West. It was mainly Christian visionaries, Spiritualists, Occultists, and Theosophists of the 19th and 20th century that reported them (Schlieter 2018).\n\nAccording to Parnia, near death experiences' interpretations are influenced by religious, social, cultural backgrounds. However, the core elements appear to transcend borders and can be considered universal. In fact, some of these core elements have even been reported by children <3 years old (this occurred over many months, whilst playing and communicated using children's language). In other words, at an age where they should not have been influenced by culture or tradition.\n\nAlso, according to Greyson, the central features of NDEs are universal and have not been influenced by time. These have been observed throughout history and in different cultures. This notwithstanding, cultural influences have probably played a role in some NDEs' reported descriptions.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11065190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11065190", "title": "Norman conquest of southern Italy", "text": "Norman conquest of southern Italy\n\nThe Norman conquest of southern Italy lasted from 999 to 1139, involving many battles and independent conquerors. In 1130 these territories in southern Italy united as the Kingdom of Sicily, which included the island of Sicily, the southern third of the Italian Peninsula (except Benevento, which was briefly held twice), the archipelago of Malta and parts of North Africa.\n\nItinerant Norman forces arrived in the Mezzogiorno as mercenaries in the service of Lombard and Byzantine factions, communicating news swiftly back home about opportunities in the Mediterranean. These groups gathered in several places, establishing fiefdoms and states of their own, uniting and elevating their status to \"de facto\" independence within fifty years of their arrival.\n\nUnlike the Norman conquest of England (1066), which took a few years after one decisive battle, the conquest of southern Italy was the product of decades and a number of battles, few decisive. Many territories were conquered independently, and only later were unified into a single state. Compared to the conquest of England it was unplanned and disorganised, but equally complete.\n\nThere is little evidence for Viking activity in Italy as a precursor to the arrival of the Normans in 999, but some raiding is recorded. Ermentarius of Noirmoutier and the Annals of St-Bertin provide contemporary evidence for Vikings based in Frankia proceeding to Iberia and thence to Italy around 860.\n\nSome modern scholars have connected this event with a much later account by the infamously unreliable Dudo of Saint-Quentin, who has a Viking fleet led by one Alstingus land at the Ligurian port of Luni and sacking the city. The Vikings then move another down the Tuscan coast to the mouth of the Arno, sacking Pisa and then, following the river upstream, also attack the hill-town of Fiesole above Florence and win other victories around the Mediterranean (including in Sicily and North Africa). Building modern speculation on medieval invention, some scholarship has identified the leaders of this expedition as Björn Ironside and Hastein. Dudo's account, however, probably adds no historically reliable information to the brief contemporary annals.\n\nOther contact between Italy and the Viking world occurred via Eastern Scandinavians coming to Italy via the \"Austrvegr\" (the river routes from the Baltic to the Black Sea) and working as Varangian mercenaries fighting for Byzantium. In particular, three or four eleventh-century Swedish Runestones mention Italy, memorialising warriors who died in 'Langbarðaland', the Old Norse name for southern Italy (Langobardia Minor). Varangians may first have been deployed as mercenaries in Italy against the Arabs as early as 936.\n\nThe earliest reported date of the arrival of Norman knights in southern Italy is 999, although it may be assumed that they had visited before then. In that year, according to some traditional sources of uncertain origin, Norman pilgrims returning from the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem via Apulia stayed with Prince Guaimar III in Salerno. The city and its environs were attacked by Saracens from Africa demanding payment of an overdue annual tribute. While Guaimar began to collect the tribute the Normans ridiculed him and his Lombard subjects for cowardice, and they assaulted their besiegers. The Saracens fled, booty was confiscated and a grateful Guaimar asked the Normans to stay. They refused, but promised to bring his rich gifts to their compatriots in Normandy and tell them about possibly lucrative military service in Salerno. Some sources have Guaimar sending emissaries to Normandy to bring back knights, and this account of the arrival of the Normans is sometimes known as the \"Salerno (or Salernitan) tradition\".\n\nThe Salerno tradition was first recorded by Amatus of Montecassino in his \"Ystoire de li Normant\" between 1071 and 1086. Much of this information was borrowed from Amatus by Peter the Deacon for his continuation of the \"Chronicon Monasterii Casinensis\" of Leo of Ostia, written during the early 12th century. Beginning with the \"Annales Ecclesiastici\" of Baronius in the 17th century, the Salernitan story became the accepted history. Although its factual accuracy was questioned periodically during the following centuries, it has been accepted (with some modifications) by most scholars since.\n\nAnother historical account of the arrival of the first Normans in Italy, the \"Gargano tradition\", appears in primary chronicles without reference to any previous Norman presence. According to this account Norman pilgrims at the shrine to Michael the Archangel at Monte Gargano in 1016 met the Lombard Melus of Bari, who persuaded them to join him in an attack on the Byzantine government of Apulia.\n\nAs with the Salerno tradition, there are two primary sources for the Gargano story: the \"Gesta Roberti Wiscardi\" of William of Apulia (dated 1088–1110) and the \"Chronica monasterii S. Bartholomaei de Carpineto\" of a monk named Alexander, written about a century later and based on William's work. Some scholars have combined the Salerno and Gargano tales, and John Julius Norwich suggested that the meeting between Melus and the Normans had been arranged by Guaimar. Melus had been in Salerno just before his visit to Monte Gargano.\n\nAnother story involves the exile of a group of brothers from the Drengot family. One of the brothers, Osmund (according to Orderic Vitalis) or Gilbert (according to Amatus and Peter the Deacon), murdered William Repostel (Repostellus) in the presence of Robert I, Duke of Normandy after Repostel allegedly boasted about dishonouring his murderer's daughter. Threatened with death, the Drengot brother fled with his siblings to Rome and one of the brothers had an audience with the pope before joining Melus (Melo) of Bari. Amatus dates the story to after 1027, and does not mention the pope. According to him, Gilbert's brothers were Osmund, Ranulf, Asclettin and Ludolf (Rudolf, according to Peter).\nBetween 1016 and 1024, in a fragmented political context, the County of Ariano was founded by the group of Norman knights headed by Gilbert and hired by Melus. The County, which replaced the pre-existing chamberlainship, was considered to be the first political body established by the Normans in the South of Italy.\n\nRepostel's murder is dated by all the chronicles to the reign of Robert the Magnificent and after 1027, although some scholars believe \"Robert\" was a scribal error for \"Richard\" (Richard II of Normandy, who was duke in 1017). The earlier date is necessary if the emigration of the first Normans was connected to the Drengots and the murder of William Repostel. In the \"Histories\" of Ralph Glaber, \"Rodulfus\" leaves Normandy after displeasing Count Richard (Richard II). The sources disagree about which brother was the leader on the southern trip. Orderic and William of Jumièges, in the latter's \"Gesta Normannorum Ducum\", name Osmund; Glaber names Rudolph, and Leo, Amatus and Adhemar of Chabannes name Gilbert. According to most southern-Italian sources, the leader of the Norman contingent at the Battle of Cannae in 1018 was Gilbert. If Rudolf is identified with the Rudolf of Amatus' history as a Drengot brother, he may have been the leader at Cannae.\n\nA modern hypothesis concerning the Norman arrival in the Mezzogiorno concerns the chronicles of Glaber, Adhemar and Leo (not Peter's continuation). All three chronicles indicate that Normans (either a group of 40 or a much-larger force of around 250) under \"Rodulfus\" (Rudolf), fleeing Richard II, came to Pope Benedict VIII of Rome. The pope sent them to Salerno (or Capua) to seek mercenary employment against the Byzantines because of the latter's invasion of papal Beneventan territory. There, they met the Beneventan \"primates\" (leading men): Landulf V of Benevento, Pandulf IV of Capua, (possibly) Guaimar III of Salerno and Melus of Bari. According to Leo's chronicle, \"Rudolf\" was Ralph of Tosni. If the first confirmed Norman military actions in the south involved Melus' mercenaries against the Byzantines in May 1017, the Normans probably left Normandy between January and April.\n\nOn 9 May 1009, an insurrection erupted in Bari against the Catapanate of Italy, the regional Byzantine authority based there. Led by Melus, a local Lombard, the revolt quickly spread to other cities. Late that year (or early in 1010) the \"katepano\", John Curcuas, was killed in battle. In March 1010 his successor, Basil Mesardonites, disembarked with reinforcements and besieged the rebels in the city. The Byzantine citizens negotiated with Basil and forced the Lombard leaders, Melus and his brother-in-law Dattus, to flee. Basil entered the city on 11 June 1011, reestablishing Byzantine authority. He did not follow his victory with severe sanctions, only sending Melus' family (including his son, Argyrus) to Constantinople. Basil died in 1016, after years of peace in southern Italy.\n\nLeo Tornikios Kontoleon arrived as Basil's successor in May of that year. After Basil's death, Melus revolted again; this time, he used a newly arrived band of Normans sent by Pope Benedict or who met him (with or without Guaimar's aid) at Monte Gargano. Tornikios sent an army, led by Leo Passianos, against the Lombard-Norman coalition. Passianos and Melus met on the Fortore at Arenula; the battle was either indecisive (William of Apulia) or a victory for Melus (Leo of Ostia and Amatus). Tornikios then took command, leading his forces into a second encounter near Civita. This second battle was a victory for Melus, although Lupus Protospatharius and the anonymous chronicler of Bari recorded a defeat. A third battle (a decisive victory for Melus) took place at Vaccaricia; the region from the Fortore to Trani was in his hands, and in September Tornikios was replaced by Basil Boiannes (who arrived in December). According to Amatus, there were five consecutive Lombard and Norman victories by October 1018.\n\nAt Boioannes' request, a detachment of the elite Varangian Guard was sent to Italy to fight the Normans. The armies met at the Ofanto near Cannae, the site of Hannibal's victory over the Romans in 216 BC, and the Battle of Cannae was a decisive Byzantine victory; Amatus wrote that only ten Normans survived from a contingent of 250. After the battle, Ranulf Drengot (one of the Norman survivors) was elected leader of their company. Boioannes protected his gains by building a fortress at the Apennine pass, guarding the entrance to the Apulian plain. In 1019 Troia (as the fortress was known) was garrisoned by Boioannes' Norman troops, an indication of Norman willingness to fight on either side. With Norman mercenaries on both sides, they would obtain good terms for the release of their brethren from their captors regardless of outcome.\n\nAlarmed by the shift in momentum in the south, Pope Benedict (who may have initiated Norman involvement in the war) went north in 1020 to Bamberg to confer with Holy Roman Emperor Henry II. Although the emperor took no immediate action, events the following year persuaded him to intervene. Boioannes (allied with Pandulf of Capua) marched on Dattus, who was garrisoning a tower in the territory of the Duchy of Gaeta with papal troops. Dattus was captured and, on 15 June 1021, received the traditional Roman \"poena cullei\": he was tied up in a sack with a monkey, a rooster and a snake and thrown into the sea. In 1022, a large imperial army marched south in three detachments under Henry II, Pilgrim of Cologne and Poppo of Aquileia to attack Troia. Although Troia did not fall, the Lombard princes were allied with the Empire and Pandulf removed to a German prison; this ended the Lombard revolt.\n\nIn 1024, Norman mercenaries under Ranulf Drengot were in the service of Guaimar III when he and Pandulf IV besieged Pandulf V in Capua. In 1026, after an 18-month siege, Capua surrendered and Pandulf IV was reinstated as prince. During the next few years Ranulf would attach himself to Pandulf, but in 1029 he joined Sergius IV of Naples (whom Pandulf expelled from Naples in 1027, probably with Ranulf's assistance).\n\nIn 1029, Ranulf and Sergius recaptured Naples. In early 1030 Sergius gave Ranulf the County of Aversa as a fief, the first Norman lordship in southern Italy. Sergius also gave his sister, the widow of the duke of Gaeta, in marriage to Ranulf. In 1034, however, Sergius' sister died and Ranulf returned to Pandulf. According to Amatus:\n\nFor the Normans never desired any of the Lombards to win a decisive victory, in case this should be to their disadvantage. But now supporting the one and then aiding the other, they prevented anyone being completely ruined.\n\nNorman reinforcements and local miscreants, who found a welcome in Ranulf's camp with no questions asked, swelled Ranulf's numbers. There, Amatus observed that the Norman language and customs welded a disparate group into the semblance of a nation. In 1035, Tancred of Hauteville's three eldest sons (William \"Iron Arm\", Drogo and Humphrey) arrived in Aversa from Normandy.\n\nIn 1037, or the summer of 1038 (sources differ), Norman influence was further solidified when Emperor Conrad II deposed Pandulf and invested Ranulf as Count of Aversa. In 1038 Ranulf invaded Capua, expanding his polity into one of the largest in southern Italy.\n\nIn 1038 Byzantine Emperor Michael IV launched a military campaign into Muslim Sicily, with General George Maniaches leading the Christian army against the Saracens. The future king of Norway, Harald Hardrada, commanded the Varangian Guard in the expedition and Michael called on Guaimar IV of Salerno and other Lombard lords to provide additional troops for the campaign. Guiamar sent 300 Norman knights from Aversa, including the three Hauteville brothers (who would achieve renown for their prowess in battle). William of Hauteville became known as William Bras-de-Fer (\"William Iron Arm\") for single-handedly killing the emir of Syracuse during that city's siege. The Norman contingent would leave before the campaign's end due to the inadequate distribution of Saracen loot.\n\nAfter the assassination of Catapan Nikephoros Dokeianos at Ascoli in 1040 the Normans elected Atenulf, brother of Pandulf III of Benevento, their leader. On 16 March 1041, near Venosa on the Olivento, the Norman army tried to negotiate with Catapan Michael Dokeianos; although they failed, they still defeated the Byzantine army in the Battle of Olivento. On 4 May 1041 the Norman army, led by William Iron Arm, defeated the Byzantines again in the Battle of Montemaggiore near Cannae (avenging the Norman defeat in the 1018 Battle of Cannae. Although the catapan summoned a large Varangian force from Bari, the battle was a rout; many of Michael's soldiers drowned in the Ofanto while retreating.\n\nOn 3 September 1041 at the Battle of Montepeloso, the Normans (nominally under Arduin and Atenulf) defeated Byzantine catepan Exaugustus Boioannes and brought him to Benevento. Around that time, Guaimar IV of Salerno began to attract the Normans. In February 1042, Atenulf negotiated the ransom of Exaugustus and then fled with the ransom money to Byzantine territory. He was replaced by Argyrus, who was bribed to defect to the Byzantines after a few early victories.\n\nThe revolt, originally Lombard, had become Norman in character and leadership. In September 1042, the three principal Norman groups held a council in Melfi which included Ranulf Drengot, Guaimar IV and William Iron Arm. William and the other leaders petitioned Guaimar to recognize their conquests, and William was acknowledged as the Norman leader in Apula (which included Melfi and the Norman garrison at Troia). He received the title of Count of Apulia from Guiamar, and (like Ranulf) was his vassal. Guaimar proclaimed himself Duke of Apulia and Calabria, although he was never formally invested as such by the Holy Roman Emperor. William was married to Guida (daughter of Guy, Duke of Sorrento and Guaimar's niece), strengthening the alliance between the Normans and Guaimar.\n\nAt Melfi in 1043, Guaimar divided the region (except for Melfi itself, which was to be governed on a republican model) into twelve baronies for the Norman leaders. William received Ascoli, Asclettin Drengot received Acerenza, Tristan received Montepeloso, Hugh Tubœuf received Monopoli, Peter received Trani, Drogo of Hauteville received Venosa and Ranulf Drengot (now the independent Duke of Gaeta) received Siponto and Monte Gargano.\n\nDuring their reign William and Guaimar began the conquest of Calabria in 1044, and built the castle of Stridula (near Squillace). William was less successful in Apulia, where he was defeated in 1045 near Taranto by Argyrus (although his brother, Drogo, conquered Bovino). At William's death, the period of Norman mercenary service ended with the rise of two Norman principalities owing nominal allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire: the County of Aversa (later the Principality of Capua) and the County of Apulia (later the Duchy of Apulia).\n\nIn 1046 Drogo entered Apulia and defeated the catepan, Eustathios Palatinos, near Taranto while his brother Humphrey forced Bari to conclude a treaty with the Normans. Also that year, Richard Drengot arrived with 40 knights from Normandy and Robert \"Guiscard\" Hauteville arrived with other Norman immigrants.\n\nIn 1047 Guaimar (who had supported Drogo's succession and the establishment of a Norman dynasty in the south) gave him his daughter, Gaitelgrima, in marriage. Emperor Henry III confirmed the county of Aversa in its fidelity to him and made Drogo his vassal, granting him the title \"dux et magister Italiae comesque Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae\" (duke and master of Italy and count of the Normans of all Apulia and Calabria, the first legitimate title for the Normans of Melfi). Henry did not confirm the other titles given during the 1042 council; he demoted Guiamar to \"prince of Salerno\", and Capua was bestowed upon Pandulf IV for the third (and final) time. Henry, whose wife Agnes had been mistreated by the Beneventans, authorised Drogo to conquer Benevento for the imperial crown; he did so in 1053.\n\nIn 1048 Drogo commanded an expedition into Calabria via the valley of Crati, near Cosenza. He distributed the conquered territories in Calabria and gave his brother, Robert Guiscard, a castle at Scribla to guard the entrance to the recently conquered territory; Guiscard would later abandon it for a castle at San Marco Argentano. Shortly thereafter he married the daughter of another Norman lord, who gave him 200 knights (furthering his military campaign in Calabria). In 1051 Drogo was assassinated by Byzantine conspirators and was succeeded by his brother, Humphrey. Humphrey's first challenge was to deal with papal opposition to the Normans. The Norman knights' treatment of the Lombards during Drogo's reign triggered more revolts. During the unrest, the Italo-Norman John, Abbot of Fécamp was accosted on his return trip from Rome; he wrote to Pope Leo IX:\nThe hatred of the Italians for the Normans has now reached such a pitch that it is almost impossible for any Norman, albeit a pilgrim, to journey in the towns of Italy, without being assailed, abducted, robbed, beaten, thrown in irons, even if fortunate enough not to die in a prison.\n\nThe pope and his supporters, including the future Gregory VII, called for an army to oust the Normans from Italy.\n\nOn 18 June 1053, Humphrey led the Norman armies against the combined forces of the pope and the Holy Roman Empire. At the Battle of Civitate the Normans destroyed the papal army and captured Leo IX, imprisoning him in Benevento (which had surrendered). Humphrey conquered Oria, Nardò, and Lecce by the end of 1055. In 1054 Peter II, who succeeded Peter I in the region of Trani, captured the city from the Byzantines. Humphrey died in 1057; he was succeeded by Guiscard, who ended his loyalty to the Empire and made himself a papal vassal in return for the title of duke.\n\nDuring the 1050s and 1060s, there were two centres of Norman power in southern Italy: one at Melfi (under the Hautevilles) and another at Aversa (under the Drengots). Richard Drengot became ruler of the County of Aversa in 1049, beginning a policy of territorial aggrandisement to compete with his Hauteville rivals. At first he warred with his Lombard neighbours, who included Pandulf VI of Capua, Atenulf I of Gaeta and Gisulf II of Salerno. Richard pushed back the borders of Salerno until there was little left of the once-great principality but the city of Salerno itself. Although he tried to extend his influence peacefully by betrothing his daughter to the oldest son of Atenulf of Gaeta, when the boy died before the marriage he still demanded the Lombard dower from the boy's parents. When the duke refused, Richard seized Aquino (one of Gaeta's few remaining fiefs) in 1058. However, the chronology of his conquest of Gaeta is confusing. Documents from 1058 and 1060 refer to Jordan (Richard's oldest son) as Duke of Gaeta, but these have been disputed as forgeries (since Atenulf was still duke when he died in 1062). After Atenulf's death, Richard and Jordan took over the rule of the duchy and allowed Atenulf's heir—Atenulf II—to rule as their subject until 1064 (when Gaeta was fully incorporated into the Drengot principality). Richard and Jordan appointed puppet, usually Norman, dukes.\n\nWhen the prince of Capua died in 1057, Richard immediately besieged the comune. This chronology is also unclear. Pandulf was succeeded at Capua by his brother, Landulf VIII, who is recorded as prince until 12 May 1062. Richard and Jordan took the princely title in 1058, but apparently allowed Landulf to continue ruling beneath them for at least four years more. In 1059 Pope Nicholas II convened a synod at Melfi confirming Richard as Count of Aversa and Prince of Capua, and Richard swore allegiance to the papacy for his holdings. The Drengots then made Capua their headquarters for ruling Aversa and Gaeta.\n\nRichard and Jordan expanded their new Gaetan and Capuan territories northwards toward Latium, into the Papal States. In 1066 Richard marched on Rome, but was easily repelled. Jordan's tenure as Richard's successor marked an alliance with the papacy (which Richard had attempted), and the conquests of Capua ceased. When Jordan died in 1090, his young son Richard II and his regents were unable to hold Capua. They were forced to flee the city by a Lombard, Lando, who ruled it with popular support until he was forced out by the combined Hauteville forces in the siege of Capua in 1098; this ended Lombard rule in Italy.\n\nIn 1077 the last Lombard prince of Benevento died, and in 1078 the pope appointed Robert Guiscard to succeed him. In 1081, however, Guiscard relinquished Benevento. By then, the principality comprised little more than Benevento and its environs; it had been reduced in size by Norman conquests during the previous decades, especially after the Battle of Civitate and after 1078. At Ceprano in June 1080 the pope again gave Guiscard control of Benevento, an attempt to halt Norman incursions into it and associated territory in the Abruzzi (which Guiscard's relatives had been appropriating).\n\nAfter the Battle of Civitate, the Normans began the conquest of the Adriatic coast of Benevento. Geoffrey of Hauteville, a brother of the Hauteville counts of Melfi, conquered the Lombard county of Larino and stormed the castle Morrone in the region of Samnium-Guillamatum. Geoffrey's son, Robert, united these conquests into a county, Loritello, in 1061 and continued his expansion into Lombard Abruzzo. He conquered the Lombard county of Teate (modern Chieti) and besieged Ortona, which became the goal of Norman efforts in that region. Loritello soon reached as far north as the Pescara and the Papal States. In 1078 Robert allied with Jordan of Capua to ravage the Papal Abruzzo, but after a 1080 treaty with Pope Gregory VII they were obligated to respect papal territory. In 1100 Robert of Loritello extended his principality across the Fortore, taking Bovino and Dragonara.\n\nThe conquest of the Molise is poorly documented. Boiano (the principal town) may have been conquered the year before the Battle of Civitate by Robert Guiscard, who had encircled the Matese massif. The county of Boiano was bestowed on Rudolf of Moulins. His grandson, Hugh, expanded it eastward (occupying Toro and San Giovanni in Galdo) and westward (annexing the Capuan counties of Venafro, Pietrabbondante and Trivento in 1105).\n\nAfter 250 years of Arab control, Sicily was inhabited by a mix of Christians, Arab Muslims, and Muslim converts at the time of its conquest by the Normans. Arab Sicily had a thriving trade network with the Mediterranean world, and was known in the Arab world as a luxurious & decadent place. It had originally been under the rule of the Aghlabids and then the Fatimids, but in 948 the Kalbids wrested control of the island and held it until 1053. During the 1010s and 1020s, a series of succession crises paved the way for interference by the Zirids of Ifriqiya. Sicily was racked by turmoil as petty fiefdoms battled each other for supremacy. Into this, the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his younger brother Roger Bosso came intending to conquer; the pope had conferred on Robert the title of \"Duke of Sicily\", encouraging him to seize Sicily from the Saracens.\n\nRobert and Roger first invaded Sicily in May 1061, crossing from Reggio di Calabria and besieging Messina for control of the strategically vital Strait of Messina. Roger crossed the strait first, landing unseen overnight and surprising the Saracen army in the morning. When Robert's troops landed later that day, they found themselves unopposed and Messina abandoned. Robert immediately fortified the city and allied himself with the emir, Ibn at-Timnah, against his rival Ibn al-Hawas. Robert, Roger, and at-Timnah then marched into the centre of the island by way of Rometta, which had remained loyal to at-Timnah. They passed through Frazzanò and the \"Pianura di Maniace\" (Plain of Maniakes), encountering resistance to their assault of Centuripe. Paternò fell quickly, and Robert brought his army to Castrogiovanni (modern Enna, the strongest fortress in central Sicily). Although the garrison was defeated the citadel did not fall, and with winter approaching Robert returned to Apulia. Before leaving, he built a fortress at San Marco d'Alunzio (the first Norman castle in Sicily). Roger returned in late 1061 and captured Troina. In June 1063 he defeated a Muslim army at the Battle of Cerami, securing the Norman foothold on the island.\nRobert returned in 1064, bypassing Castrogiovanni on his way to Palermo; however, when his camp was infested by tarantulas the campaign was called off. He invaded Palermo again in 1071, but only the city fell; its citadel did not fall until January 1072. Robert invested Roger as Count of Sicily under the suzerainty of the Duke of Apulia. In a partition of the island with his brother Robert retained Palermo, half of Messina, and the largely Christian Val Demone (leaving the rest, including what was not yet conquered, to Roger).\n\nIn 1077 Roger besieged Trapani, one of the two remaining Saracen strongholds in the west of the island. His son, Jordan, led a sortie which surprised guards of the garrison's livestock. With its food supply cut off, the city soon surrendered. In 1079 Taormina was besieged, and in 1081 Jordan, Robert de Sourval and Elias Cartomi conquered Catania (a holding of the emir of Syracuse) in another surprise attack.\n\nRoger left Sicily in the summer of 1083 to assist his brother on the mainland; Jordan (whom he had left in charge) revolted, forcing him to return to Sicily and subjugate his son. In 1085, he was finally able to undertake a systematic campaign. On 22 May Roger approached Syracuse by sea, while Jordan led a small cavalry detachment north of the city. On 25 May, the navies of the count and the emir engaged in the harbour—where the latter was killed—while Jordan's forces besieged the city. The siege lasted throughout the summer, but when the city capitulated in March 1086 only Noto was still under Saracen dominion. In February 1091 Noto yielded as well, and the conquest of Sicily was complete.\nIn 1091, Roger invaded Malta and subdued the walled city of Mdina. He imposed taxes on the islands, but allowed the Arab governors to continue their rule. In 1127 Roger II abolished the Muslim government, replacing it with Norman officials. Under Norman rule, the Arabic spoken by the Greek Christian islanders for centuries of Muslim domination became Maltese.\n\nThe fall of Amalfi and Salerno to Robert Guiscard were influenced by his wife, Sichelgaita. Amalfi probably surrendered as a result of her negotiations, and Salerno fell when she stopped petitioning her husband on behalf of her brother (the prince of Salerno). The Amalfitans unsuccessfully subjected themselves to Prince Gisulf to avoid Norman suzerainty, but the states (whose histories had been joined since the 9th century) ultimately came under Norman control.\n\nBy summer 1076, through piracy and raids Gisulf II of Salerno incited the Normans to destroy him; that season, under Richard of Capua and Robert Guiscard the Normans united to besiege Salerno. Although Gisulf ordered his citizens to store two years' worth of food, he confiscated enough of it to starve his subjects. On 13 December 1076, the city submitted; the prince and his retainers retreated to the citadel, which fell in May 1077. Although Gisulf's lands and relics were confiscated, he remained at liberty. The Principality of Salerno had already been reduced to little more than the capital city and its environs by previous wars with William of the Principate, Roger of Sicily and Robert Guiscard. However, the city was the most important in southern Italy and its capture was essential to the creation of a kingdom fifty years later.\n\nIn 1073 Sergius III of Amalfi died, leaving the infant John III as his successor. Desiring protection in unstable times, the Amalfitans exiled the young duke and summoned Robert Guiscard that year. Amalfi, however, remained restless under Norman control. Robert's successor, Roger Borsa, took control of Amalfi in 1089 after expelling Gisulf (the deposed Prince of Salerno, whom the citizens had installed with papal aid). From 1092 to 1097 Amalfi did not recognise its Norman suzerain, apparently seeking Byzantine help; Marinus Sebaste was installed as ruler in 1096.\n\nRobert's son Bohemond and his brother Roger of Sicily attacked Amalfi in 1097, but were repulsed. During this siege, the Normans began to be drawn by the First Crusade. Marinus was defeated after Amalfitan noblemen defected to the Norman side and betrayed him in 1101. Amalfi revolted again in 1130, when Roger II of Sicily demanded its loyalty. It was finally subdued in 1131 when Admiral John marched on it by land and George of Antioch blockaded it by sea, establishing a base on Capri.\n\nWhile most of Apulia (except the far south and Bari) had capitulated to the Normans in campaigns by the fraternal counts William, Drogo and Humphrey, much of Calabria remained in Byzantine hands at Robert Guiscard's 1057 succession. Calabria was first breached by William and Guaimar during the early 1040s, and Drogo installed Guiscard there during the early 1050s. However, Robert's early career in Calabria was spent in feudal infighting and robber baronage rather than organised subjugation of the Greek population.\n\nHe began his tenure with a Calabrian campaign. Briefly interrupted for the Council of Melfi on 23 August 1059 (where he was invested as duke), he returned to Calabria—and his army's siege of Cariati—later that year. The town capitulated at the duke's arrival, and Rossano and Gerace also fell before the end of the season. Of the peninsula's significant cities, only Reggio remained in Byzantine hands when Robert returned to Apulia that winter. In Apulia, he temporarily removed the Byzantine garrison from Taranto and Brindisi. The duke returned to Calabria in 1060, primarily to launch a Sicilian expedition. Although the conquest of Reggio required an arduous siege, Robert's brother Roger had siege engines prepared.\n\nAfter the fall of Reggio the Byzantine garrison fled to Reggio's island citadel of Scilla, where they were easily defeated. Roger's minor assault on Messina (across the strait) was repulsed, and Robert was called away by a large Byzantine force in Apulia sent by Constantine X late in 1060. Under the catapan Miriarch, the Byzantines retook Taranto, Brindisi, Oria, and Otranto; in January 1061, the Norman capital of Melfi was under siege. By May, however, the two brothers had expelled the Byzantines and calmed Apulia.\nGeoffrey, son of Peter I of Trani, conquered Otranto in 1063 and Taranto (which he made his county seat) in 1064. In 1066 he organised an army for a marine attack on \"Romania\" (the Byzantine Balkans), but was halted near Bari by a recently landed army of Varangian auxiliaries under the catapan Mabrica. Mabrica briefly retook Brindisi and Taranto, establishing a garrison at the former under Nikephoros Karantenos (an experienced Byzantine soldier from the Bulgar wars). Although the catapan was successful against the Normans in Italy, it was the last significant Byzantine threat. Bari, the capital of the Byzantine catapanate, was besieged by the Normans beginning in August 1068; in April 1071 the city, the last Byzantine outpost in western Europe, fell.\n\nAfter expelling the Byzantines from Apulia and Calabria (their theme of Langobardia), Robert Guiscard planned an attack on Byzantine possessions in Greece. The Byzantines had supported Robert's nephews, Abelard and Herman (the dispossessed son of Count Humphrey), in their insurrection against Robert; they had also supported Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo, who recognised Byzantine suzerainty in his county, against him.\n\nIn 1073-75 Robert's vassal, Peter II of Trani, led a Balkan expedition against the Kingdom of Croatia's Dalmatian lands. Peter's cousin Amico (son of Walter of Giovinazzo) attacked the islands of Rab and Cres, taking Croatian king Petar Krešimir IV captive. Although Petar was ransomed by the Bishop of Cres, he died shortly afterwards and was buried in the church of Saint Stephen in the Fortress of Klis.\n\nRobert undertook his first Balkan expedition in May 1081, leaving Brindisi with about 16,000 troops. By February 1082 he captured Corfu and Durazzo, defeating the Emperor Alexius I at the Battle of Dyrrhachium the previous October. Robert's son Mark Bohemond temporarily controlled Thessaly, unsuccessfully trying to retain the 1081–82 conquests in Robert's absence. The duke returned in 1084 to restore them, occupying Corfu and Kephalonia before his death from a fever on 15 July 1085. The village of Fiskardo on Cephalonia is named after Robert. Bohemond did not continue pursuing Greek conquests, returning to Italy to dispute Robert's succession with his half-brother Roger Borsa.\n\nThe Duchy of Naples, nominally a Byzantine possession, was one of the last southern Italian states to be attacked by the Normans. Since Sergius IV asked for Ranulf Drengot's help during the 1020s, with brief exceptions the dukes of Naples were allied with the Normans of Aversa and Capua. Beginning in 1077, the incorporation of Naples into the Hauteville state took sixty years to complete.\n\nIn summer 1074, hostilities flared up between Richard of Capua and Robert Guiscard. Sergius V of Naples allied with the latter, making his city a supply centre for Guiscard's troops. This pitted him against Richard, who was supported by Gregory VII. In June Richard briefly besieged Naples; Richard, Robert and Sergius soon began negotiations with Gregory, mediated by Desiderius of Montecassino.\n\nIn 1077 Naples was again besieged by Richard of Capua, with a naval blockade by Robert Guiscard. Richard died during the siege in 1078, after the deathbed lifting of his excommunication. The siege was ended by his successor, Jordan, to insinuate himself with the papacy (which had made peace with Duke Sergius).\n\nIn 1130, the Antipope Anacletus II crowned Roger II of Sicily king and declared the fief of Naples part of his kingdom. In 1131, Roger demanded from the citizens of Amalfi the defences of their city and the keys to their castle. When they refused, Sergius VII of Naples initially prepared to aid them with a fleet; George of Antioch blockaded Naples' port with a large armada and Sergius, cowed by the suppression of the Amalfitans, submitted to Roger. According to the chronicler Alexander of Telese, Naples \"which, since Roman times, had hardly ever been conquered by the sword now submitted to Roger on the strength of a mere report (i.e. Amalfi's fall).\"\n\nIn 1134 Sergius supported the rebellion of Robert II of Capua and Ranulf II of Alife, but avoided direct confrontation with Roger and paid homage to the king after the fall of Capua. On 24 April 1135 a Pisan fleet with 8,000 reinforcements, captained by Robert of Capua, anchored in Naples and the duchy was the centre of the revolt against Roger II for the next two years. Sergius, Robert and Ranulf were besieged in Naples until the spring of 1136, by which time starvation was widespread. According to historian (and rebel sympathiser) Falco of Benevento Sergius and the Neapolitans did not relent, \"preferring to die of hunger than to bare their necks to the power of an evil king.\" The naval blockade's failure to prevent Sergius and Robert from twice bringing supplies from Pisa exemplified Roger's inadequacy. When a relief army commanded by Emperor Lothair II marched to Naples, the siege was lifted. Although the emperor left the following year, in return for a pardon Sergius re-submitted to Roger in Norman feudal homage. On 30 October 1137, the last Duke of Naples died in the king's service at the Battle of Rignano.\n\nThe defeat at Rignano enabled the Norman conquest of Naples, since Sergius died without heir and the Neapolitan nobility could not reach a succession agreement. However, it was two years between Sergius' death and Naples' incorporation by Sicily. The nobility apparently ruled during the interim, which may have been the final period of Neapolitan independence from Norman rule. During this period Norman landowners first appear in Naples, although the Pisans (enemies of Roger II) retained their alliance with the duchy and Pisa may have sustained its independence until 1139. That year, Roger absorbed Naples into his kingdom; Pope Innocent II and the Neapolitan nobility acknowledged Roger's young son, Alfonso of Hauteville, as duke.\n\nAlthough the conquest of Sicily was primarily military, Robert and Roger also signed treaties with the Muslims to obtain land. Hindered by Sicily's hilly terrain and a relatively small army, the brothers sought influential, worn-down Muslim leaders to sign the treaties (offering peace and protection for land and titles). Because Sicily was conquered by a unified command, Roger's authority was not challenged by other conquerors and he maintained power over his Greek, Arab, Lombard and Norman subjects. The Roman Catholic Church was introduced to the island, and its ecclesiastical organisation was overseen by Roger with papal approval. Sees were established at Palermo (with metropolitan authority), Syracuse and Agrigento. After its elevation to a Kingdom of Sicily in 1130, Sicily became the centre of Norman power with Palermo as capital. The Kingdom was created on Christmas Day, 1130, by Roger II of Sicily, with the agreement of Pope Innocent II, who united the lands Roger had inherited from his father Roger I of Sicily.\nThese areas included the Maltese Archipelago, which was conquered from the Arabs of the Emirates of Sicily; the Duchy of Apulia and the County of Sicily, which had belonged to his cousin William II, Duke of Apulia, until William's death in 1127; and the other Norman vassals.\n\nWith the invasion of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor on behalf of his wife, Constance, the daughter of Roger II, eventually prevailed and the kingdom fell in 1194 to the House of Hohenstaufen. Through Constance, the Hauteville blood was passed to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and king of Sicily in 1198.\n\nThe Norman conquest of southern Italy began an infusion of Romanesque (specifically Norman) architecture. Some castles were expanded on existing Lombard, Byzantine and Arab structures, while others were original constructions. The castles drew on local craftsmanship, and retained distinctive elements of their non-Norman origins. Latin cathedrals were built in lands recently converted from Greek Orthodoxy or Islam, in a Romanesque style influenced by Byzantine and Islamic designs.\n\nNorman administration was centralised, complex and bureaucratic compared with other contemporary western European systems. Public buildings, such as palaces, were common in larger cities (notably Palermo); these structures, in particular, demonstrate the influence of Siculo-Arab culture.\n\nThe Normans rapidly began the construction, expansion and renovation of castles in southern Italy. Most were original or based on pre-existing Lombard structures, although some were built on Byzantine or (in Sicily) Arab foundations. By the end of the Norman period, most wooden castles were converted to stone.\n\nAfter the Lombard castle at Melfi, which was conquered by the Normans early and augmented with a surviving, rectangular donjon late in the 11th century, Calabria was the first province affected by Norman encastellation. In 1046 William Iron Arm began construction of Stridula (a large castle near Squillace), and by 1055 Robert Guiscard built three castles: at Rossano, on the site of a Byzantine fortress; at Scribla, the seat of his fief guarding the pass of the Val di Crati, and at San Marco Argentano (donjon built in 1051) near Cosenza. In 1058, Scalea was built on a seaside cliff.\n\nGuiscard was a major castle-builder after his accession to the Apulian countship, building a castle at Gargano with pentagonal towers known as the Towers of Giants. Later, Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo built a castle at nearby Castelpagano. In the Molise the Normans built many fortresses into the naturally defensible terrain, such as Santa Croce and Ferrante. The region of a line running from Terracina to Termoli has the greatest density of Norman castles in Italy. Many sites were originally Samnite strongholds reused by the Romans and their successors; the Normans called such a fortress a \"castellum vetus\" (old castle). Many Molisian castles have walls integrated into the mountains and ridges, and much of the quickly erected masonry demonstrates that the Normans introduced the \"opus gallicum\" into the Molise.\n\nThe encastellation of Sicily was begun at the behest of the native Greek inhabitants. In 1060, they asked Guiscard to construct a castle at Aluntium. The first Norman building on Sicily, San Marco d'Alunzio (named after Guiscard's first castle at Argentano in Calabria), was erected; its ruins survive. Petralia Soprana was then built near Cefalù, followed by a castle at Troina in 1071; in 1073 a castle was built at Mazara (extant ruins) and another at Paternò (restored ruins). At Adrano (or Aderno) the Normans built a plain, rectangular tower whose floor plan illustrates 11th-century Norman design. An outside stairway leads to the first-storey entrance, and the interior is divided lengthwise down the middle into a great hall on one side and two rooms (a chapel and chamber) on the other. Other fortifications in Sicily were appropriated from the Arabs, and the palatial and cathedral architecture of cities such as Palermo has obvious Arab features.

It includes behaviors such as repeated calls and texts, malicious contact, spreading rumors, stalking, and violence (kidnapping and assault).\n\nDrs. Brian Spitzberg and William Cupach, the creators of the term, define ORI as \"repeated and unwanted pursuit and invasion of one's sense of physical or symbolic privacy by another person, either stranger or acquaintance, who desires and/or presumes an intimate relationship\". Some victims of ORI have no preexisting relationship with or interest in their pursuers; others know their pursuers, but are less interested in making an existing relationship more intimate.\n\nThere are several key components of ORI that distinguish it from other similar relational patterns.\n\nFirst, ORI involves a lack of mutual agreement regarding the nature or even the existence of a relationship. While the person obsessed with the relationship is attempting to make a closer connection, the object of ORI desires freedom from continued forced contact. Spitzberg writes that \"this dialectical tension is endemic to the formation and ongoing construction of all interpersonal relationships\".\n\nSecond, ORI is not associated with a singular event, but is repeated. Spitzberg and Cupach write, \"Obsessiveness is reflected in the fact that the intruder is fixated on the target of attention; the intruder's thoughts and behaviors are persistent, preoccupying, and often morbid. Pursuit is persistent despite the absence of reciprocity by the obsessional object and despite resistance by the object.\" The episodes of unwanted behavior tend to escalate over time, with the seriousness rising and the time between incidents shortening.\n\nThird, the intrusion can be symbolic and psychological, not just physical. The invasion of privacy as well as the imposition on the victim's feelings of freedom of choice are important aspects of ORI.\n\nStudies have been done to explore certain factors that predispose individuals to ORI. Some have found narcissism and low empathy as predictors for ORI, and hypothesized that people with high empathy would be more inclined to judge ORI behaviors as unacceptable. But this pattern has been found inconclusive; one study found that empathy may not inhibit ORI, although there is a substantial positive relationship between narcissism and the acceptability of ORI.\n\nMany victims of ORI have also experienced sexual coercion, and the coping responses used for both tend to be similar. Additionally, the more serious the intrusion (for example, violence), the more formal the coping response (for example, calling the police).\n\nORI behavior, as well as non-ORI sexually coercive behavior, can involve types of coercion identified as deception coercion, mild force coercion, psychological coercion and severe force coercion.\n\nStalking, a severe form of ORI, is typically defined as \"the willful, malicious, and repeated following and harassing of another persons that threatens his or her safety\".\n\nSpitzberg and Cupach state more research is needed to correctly capture the connection, but ORI and stalking are pervasive and impactful occurrences. A clearer picture is needed to better understand the incidence, prevalence and consequences of ORI and stalking. Better understanding will provide improvements in prevention, intervention and treatment of offenders and victims.\n\nThe authors Brian Spitzberg and William Cupach developed ORI in 1998, and published their research in their book \"The Dark Side of Close Relationships.\"\n\nAccording to the Relational Goal Pursuit Theory (RGPT), people expend energy to develop or reinitiate relationships to the extent that they perceive a relationship desirable and attainable. It becomes all about achieving the goal of a relationship. ORI occurs when people continue to believe that a relationship is attainable even though it is not. The pursuer begins to escalate when they meet challenges to their goal. \nRGPT identifies processes that conspire to transform otherwise normal relationships into ORI and stalking. All relationships begin with a goal to pursuit. The following are some rules:\n\n\nCultural scripts – if people play hard to get enough, eventually win the affection of person trying to love – usually work against the realization that the relationship is unattainable.\n\nAmbiguous communication – initiation, reinitiating and rejection of relationships may keep hope alive. Using indirect signals to reject people because they are worried about hurting their feelings, pursuers usually interpret this incorrectly.\n\nRumination – when people can’t obtain a goal, they tend to fixate on the problem and pursuers redouble their efforts.\n\nShift in motivation – when pursuer moves from desire to revenge from a feeling of being humiliated. This shift usually marks the beginning of more aggressive behaviors.\n\nWith the increase of Facebook and other social media tools designed to make us more accessible to others while taking away pieces of our privacy, ORI has become easier in an online world. There is relational intrusion from both offenders and targets in five different categories:\n\n\nOnline social media helps to facilitate behaviors indicative of ORI and these behaviors have consequences for users on their privacy and security.\n"}

It consisted of a theatre, a music hall, a concert hall, and a roof garden. It was later named the New York Theatre and Loew's New York.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", Olympia was a \"massive gray stone building\", and extended on Longacre Square, on 45th Street, and on 44th Street. It was made from Indiana limestone, featured an imposing façade, and followed French Renaissance designs. It was designed by J. B. McElfatrick & Son.\n\nThe building was opened on November 25, 1895, with over 30 performers from Europe appearing. It was the second theater to open in what is now known as the Theater District. The first was the Empire Theatre, on the Southeast corner of 40th Street and Broadway. The Olympia was later named the New York Theatre and Loew's New York.\n\nIn 1935, architects Thomas W. Lamb and Eugene DeRosa redesigned the site. Historic sources are unclear as to whether some or all buildings in the complex were demolished and rebuilt, or the shells gutted and remodeled to build a nightclub/dancehall, the International Casino, and the Criterion Theatre, a cinema.\n\nIn 1988, the Criterion was converted to a live theatre, the Criterion Center Stage Right, and from 1991 to 1999, the space was leased to Roundabout Theatre Company, a prominent non-profit theatre company. Notable productions during Roundabout's tenure at the Criterion include the 1993 revival of Eugene O'Neill's \"Anna Christie\" (featuring Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson in their Broadway debuts), and the 1995 revival of Stephen Sondheim's \"Company\".\n\nIn 2000, Toys R Us announced plans to spend approximately $35 million on a flagship store on the site of the old Olympia (1514-1520 Broadway). The new store was devised as a bid to \"re-establish [Toys R Us] as the top retailer in its field\", and would feature a 60-foot in-store Ferris Wheel. Upon expiration of its lease, Toys R Us closed on December 30, 2015. The decision was attributed primarily to a rise in property values in Times Square that would increase its rent from $12 million to upwards of $42 million a year. In June 2015, Gap Inc. signed a lease and expected to open stores for its Gap and Old Navy brands in 2017. Combined, the Gap and Old Navy stores will account for 62,000 square feet of the 100,000-square-foot store. In July 2016, during the construction of the Gap and Old Navy flagship store, remnants of the original Olympia Theatre were found under the floors of the Toys R Us.\n\n"}

About 20 stones fell over an area of several square miles. A specimen of the meteorite was analyzed that same year by François Stanislaus Clöez, professor of chemistry at the Musée d'Histoire Naturelle, who focused on the organic matter found in this meteorite. He wrote that it contained carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and its composition was very similar to peat from the Somme valley or to the lignite of Ringkohl near Kassel. An intense scientific discussion ensued, continuing into the 1870s, as to whether the organic matter might have a biological origin.\n\nOrgueil is one of five known meteorites belonging to the CI chondrite group (see meteorites classification), this being the largest (). This group is remarkable for having a composition that is essentially identical to that of the sun, excluding gaseous elements like hydrogen and helium.\n\nBecause of its extraordinarily primitive composition and relatively large mass, Orgueil is one of the most-studied meteorites. One notable discovery in Orgueil was a high concentration of isotopically anomalous xenon called \"xenon-HL\". The carrier of this gas is extremely fine-grained diamond dust that is older than the solar system itself, known as presolar grains.\n\nIn 1962, Nagy et al. announced the discovery of 'organised elements' embedded in the Orgueil meteorite that were purportedly biological structures of extraterrestrial origin. These elements were subsequently shown to be either pollen (including that of ragwort) and fungal spores (Fitch & Anders, 1963) that had contaminated the sample, or crystals of the mineral olivine.\n\nIn 1965, a fragment of the Orgueil meteorite, kept in a sealed glass jar in Montauban since its discovery, was found to have a seed capsule embedded in it, whilst the original glassy layer on the outside remained apparently undisturbed. Despite great initial excitement, the seed capsule was shown to be that of a European rush, glued into the fragment and camouflaged using coal dust. The outer \"fusion layer\" was in fact glue. Whilst the perpetrator is unknown, it is thought that the hoax was aimed at influencing 19th century debate on spontaneous generation by demonstrating the transformation of inorganic to biological matter.\n\nRichard B. Hoover of NASA has claimed that the Orgueil meteorite contains fossils, some of which are similar to known terrestrial species. Hoover has previously claimed the existence of fossils in the Murchison meteorite. However, NASA has formally distanced itself from Hoover's claims and his lack of expert peer-reviews.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4796664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4796664", "title": "Osorno, Chile", "text": "Osorno, Chile\n\nOsorno is a city and commune in southern Chile and capital of Osorno Province in the Los Lagos Region. It had a population of 145,475, as of the 2002 census. It is located south of the national capital of Santiago, north of the regional capital of Puerto Montt and west of the Argentine city of San Carlos de Bariloche, connected via International Route 215 through the Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass. As such, it's a gateway for land access to the austral regions of Aysén and Magallanes, that would otherwise be accessible only by sea from the rest of the country.\n\nLocated at the confluence of Rahue and Damas River Osorno is the main service centre of agriculture and cattle farming in the northern Los Lagos Region. The city's cultural heritage is shaped by Spanish, Huilliche and German influences.\n\nThe city was originally planned to be founded in 1553, under the Government of Pedro de Valdivia by his companion of conquest, Lieutenant General Don Francisco de Villagra; with the name of Santa Marina de Gaete, on the site of a Huilliche village named \"Chauracavi\". However, Valdivia's death prevented the realization of this plan before it could materialize.\nOn March 27, 1558, the city was finally founded by governor García Hurtado de Mendoza, with the new name of Villa de San Mateo de Osorno, in honor of his grandfather, Count of Osorno. It was destroyed again by the indigenous Huilliche people in October 1602.\n\nOn November 22, 1792, \"Tomás de Figueroa\" took possession of the ruins. Under the orders of Ambrosio O'Higgins, Osorno was again rebuilt by Juan Mackenna, and declared officially re-populated in 1796. O'Higgins, in turn, was awarded the title of Marquess of Osorno.\n\nOsorno owes its legacy to fairly recent Chilean settlement, when the government subdued the region's indigenous Mapuche peoples in the mid-19th century and opened the land to Chilean and European immigration soon to follow. Large percentage of locals in Osorno are descendants of Spanish (the livestock grazing industry owes its foundation to the Basques) and other European immigrants. \n\nAround 1850, the government of Chile began inviting German settlers to the colony to promote growth in the region; the settlers found Osorno's climate and geography to be very similar to their own. With their help, Osorno was made the home of the National Cattle ranch of Chile, boosting the regional economy significantly. Present-day Osorno has preserved 19th century architecture and urban layout, represented by six picturesque houses which have been designated national monuments.\n\nOsorno has a long history of rivalry with Valdivia, and in a 2006 referendum, the Osorno Province rejected its proposed incorporation into the new Los Ríos Region, of which Valdivia is now the capital.\n\nOsorno has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification \"Cfb\") with a drying trend in summer. Winters are cool but mild with a July average of . Most of the precipitation falls during this time of the year with May to July being the wettest months, averaging around to of precipitation and humidity is high, averaging around 85%. Snowfalls are rare. Summers are drier and mild with a January average of and during this time, precipitation is lower, averaging in January. In some years, many days can go without a day of precipitation such as the case in 1992 when only of precipitation was recorded in January while in other years, some summers can have several wet days in a row. Temperatures can occasionally exceed anytime from December to March. The average annual precipitation is and there are 173 days with measureable precipitation. The record high was in January 1975 and the record low was in July 1954.\n\nOsorno sits in sight of Volcán Osorno, an active but minor volcano. The city's most prominent geographical feature is the Rahue River that runs north-south through its center. A smaller stream breaks off as well, running east before turning south and giving the city some natural boundaries. Located near the river front on the east side is the city's heart, the Plaza de Armas, a large, one-block park with fountains, benches, and tree-lined avenues. On the park's east side is \"La Catedral\" of Saint Matthew, one of the city's major landmarks, notable for its modern architecture. The cathedral serves as mother church of the Catholic Diocese of Osorno. Along the south side is Juan Mackenna Avenue, the city's major city centre street. Other points of interest are the main campus of the Universidad de Los Lagos and the Osorno Rodeo Stadium. The recently opened casino \"Plaza Sol de los Lagos\" is a new popular attraction for tourists and locals alike.\n\nOsorno hosts a number of annual celebrations. The \"Festival de la Carne y la Leche\" (Milk and Meat Festival) is a music festival held annually in late January, features performances by national music pop singers and bands. The \"Festival del Folklore Campesino\" (Country Folk Festival) held annually in mid-January, features performances of regional music folk artists. \n\nAnother celebration is the \"Feria Ganadera Sago Fisur\" (Sago-Fisur Cattle Fair) held annually in early November, hosted by the largest ranch in the area highlights the current state of agricultural activity. Fireworks displays are held every year around the city on September 18, the Chilean national Day, commemorating independence from Spain.\n\nOsorno is also a gateway for many tourist attractions. Puyehue National Park is a major attraction, with pristine lakes, forests, and game preserves. The volcanic area provides natural hot springs, now the site of the Aguas Calientes spa. \"Puyehue Hot Springs\" is adjacent to the park. \n\nLos Lagos Region was named for the many lakes in the area, many of which have tourist-friendly yet isolated beaches; closest to Osorno are Puyehue and Rupanco.\nAntillanca ski resort, less than a hundred kilometers away, is one of the highest-quality resorts in Chile. Ecotourism is also encouraged by the indigenous Huilliche communities, who inhabit the Pacific coastal zone. Much of the funds brought in by tourism is being used to protect native plant and tree species, most notably the Alerce, a threatened Cypress. The thick forests open onto a number of beaches and bays, such as Maicolpué, Bahía Mansa and Pucatrihue.\n\nFootball and basketball are popular sports in the city. Osorno fields a football team, Provincial Osorno, in the third level national football league. Provincial Osorno plays home games at the Estadio Ruben Marcos Peralta, which has a seating capacity of 10,800.\n\nOsorno's official basketball team in one of the National Basketball Leagues is named Osorno Basquetbol. Their home games are held at the \"Gimnasio María Gallardo\", which has a seating capacity of almost 4,500.\n\nChilean rodeo is popular in Osorno, as it is in most of the center-south zone of the country. Osorno's rodeo stadium, the Medialuna de Osorno, is considered one of the bests in the country, and was the qualifying arena for the southern region of the national rodeo in 2006.\n\nBoxing is also one of the city's pastimes; Osorno produced Chile's boxing representative at the 1972 Summer Olympics, Martín Vargas. Additionally, the mountainous terrain surrounding Osorno is used for skiing and snowboarding, sports popularized by the large tide of German immigrants. It is the closest city to the Antillanca ski resort, only 98 km away.\n\nOsorno is an important agricultural center, and agriculture makes up the bulk of the Osorno province's economic activity. Wheat and oats grow abundantly, but the land is also well-suited to the breeding of Chilean horses and cattle. Some of Chile's finest beef products originate in the Osorno ranches.\n\nOsorno's proximity to the Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass makes it a key place the national economy. The mountain pass connects Osorno to the Argentine city of Bariloche, and is one of primary arteries that ties the two countries' southern regions together. The pass is particularly important due to the fact that it crosses the Andes mountains at very low altitude, allowing it to remain open even when other passes are blocked by snow.\n\nDespite all this, Osorno has seen some economic stagnation in the past several decades. Agriculture alone has not allowed it to keep pace with the booming, rapidly industrializing Chilean economy; Osorno lacks both industrial and information-services sectors. In one effort to combat this, the city has forged international business ties with several Dutch companies, after it was discovered that the local climate is ideal for the growing of tulips. Likewise, Osorno has recently entered the international meat market. Besides offering high-quality beef, the isolated region is also completely free of the recent rash of cattle plagues such as Mad Cow and foot-and-mouth disease, guaranteeing the safety of Chilean meats.\n\nOsorno is now faced with a unique opportunity: the arable land is suited for the growing of beets, soy, and corn, crops rising in popularity with the recent development of biocombustibles: fuels derived from crops, such as corn-derived ethanol. It is hoped that the Chilean government's announcement that it will not apply the same steep taxes to agricultural fuels as it does to petroleum products, as well as the increasing demand for more environment-friendly fuels, will mean that Osorno will again become a major economic hub.\n\nAs Chile continues to develop as one of South America's economic leaders and one of the most stable states in the region, tourism is on the rise, and visitors are attracted by Osorno's natural environment and old-European atmosphere.\n\nThe city is served by Canal Bajo Carlos Hott Siebert Airport, which offers 2-hour flights to Santiago. Buses also depart for the capital daily. The Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass also marks the city as a major gateway to and from Argentina.\n\nInternational schools\n\nSt. Matthew's Cathedral, Osorno, located in the city of Osorno, is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Osorno.\n\nAccording to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Osorno spans an area of and has 145,475 inhabitants (70,743 men and 74,732 women). Of these, 132,245 (90.9%) lived in urban areas and 13,230 (9.1%) in rural areas. The population grew by 13.9% (17,706 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.\n\n\nAs a commune, Osorno is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Jaime Alberto Bertin Valenzuela.\n\nWithin the electoral divisions of Chile, Osorno is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Fidel Espinoza (PS), Javier Hernández (UDI), Harry Jürgensen (RN) and Emilia Nuyado (PS) as part of the 25th electoral district. The commune is represented in the Senate by Rabindranath Quinteros Lara (PS) and Iván Alejandro Moreira Barros (UDI) as part of the 17th senatorial constituency (Los Lagos Region).\n\n"}

Afterwards she revealed the offence to various Roman noblemen, and then committed suicide. The Roman noblemen, led by Lucius Junius Brutus, obtained the support of the Roman aristocracy and the people to expel the king and his family and to institute a republic. The Roman army supported Brutus, and the king went into exile. Despite a number of attempts by Lucius Tarquinius Superbus to reinstate the monarchy, the citizens established a republic and thereafter elected two consuls annually to rule the city.\n\nRoman history held that seven kings of Rome reigned from the establishment of the city in 753 BC by Romulus up to the reign of Tarquinius. The accuracy of this account has been doubted by modern historians, although it appears to be accepted that there was a monarchy, and the last king Tarquinius was expelled upon the founding of the republic in the late 6th century BC.\n\nTarquinius was the son of the fifth king, Lucius Tarquinius Priscus. In around 535 BC Tarquinius, together with his wife Tullia Minor (one of the daughters of the then king Servius Tullius) arranged the murder of Servius, and Tarquinius became king in his place.\n\nDespite various military victories, Tarquinius became an unpopular king. He refused to bury his predecessor, then put to death a number of the leading senators whom he suspected of remaining loyal to Servius (one of whom was the brother of Lucius Junius Brutus). By not replacing the slain senators, and not consulting the Senate on all matters of government, he diminished both the size and authority of the Senate. In another break with tradition, he judged capital criminal cases without advice of counsellors, thereby creating fear among those who might think to oppose him. He also engaged in treachery with the Latin allies.\n\nIn about 510 BC, Tarquinius went to war with the Rutuli. According to Livy, the Rutuli were, at that time, a very wealthy nation and Tarquinius was keen to obtain the spoils that would come with victory over the Rutuli in order, in part, to assuage the anger of his subjects.\n\nTarquinius unsuccessfully sought to take the Rutulian capital Ardea by storm, and subsequently began an extensive siege of the city.\n\nSextus Tarquinius, the king's son, was sent on a military errand to Collatia. Sextus was received with great hospitality at the governor's mansion, home of Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, son of the king's nephew, Arruns Tarquinius, former governor of Collatia and first of the Tarquinii Collatini. Lucius' wife, Lucretia, daughter of Spurius Lucretius, prefect of Rome, \"a man of distinction\", made sure that the king's son was treated as became his rank, although her husband was away at the siege.\n\nIn a variant of the story, Sextus and Lucius, at a wine party on furlough, were debating the virtues of wives when Lucius volunteered to settle the debate by all of them riding to his home to see what Lucretia was doing. She was weaving with her maids. The party awarded her the palm of victory and Lucius invited them to visit, but for the time being they returned to camp.\n\nAt night Sextus entered her bedroom by stealth, quietly going around the slaves who were sleeping at her door. She awakened, he identified himself and offered her two choices: she could submit to his sexual advances and become his wife and future queen, or he would kill her and one of her slaves and place the bodies together, then claim he had caught her having adulterous sex (see sexuality in ancient Rome). In the alternative story, he returned from camp a few days later with one companion to take Collatinus up on his invitation to visit and was lodged in a guest bedroom. He entered Lucretia's room while she lay naked in her bed and started to wash her belly with water, which woke her up.\n\nThe next day Lucretia dressed in black and went to her father's house in Rome and cast herself down in the suppliant's position (embracing the knees), weeping. Asked to explain herself she insisted on first summoning witnesses and after disclosing the rape, called on them for vengeance, a plea that could not be ignored, as she was speaking to the chief magistrate of Rome. While they were debating she drew a concealed dagger and stabbed herself in the heart. She died in her father's arms, with the women present keening and lamenting. \"This dreadful scene struck the Romans who were present with so much horror and compassion that they all cried out with one voice that they would rather die a thousand deaths in defence of their liberty than suffer such outrages to be committed by the tyrants.\"\n\nIn the alternative version, Lucretia summoned Lucius Junius Brutus (a leading citizen, and the grandson of Rome's fifth king Tarquinius Priscus), along with her father Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus, another leading citizen Publius Valerius Publicola, and her husband Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus (also related to Tarquinius Priscus) to Collatia after she had been raped. Lucretia, believing that the rape dishonored her and her family, committed suicide by stabbing herself with a dagger after telling of what had befallen her. According to legend, Brutus grabbed the dagger from Lucretia's breast after her death and immediately shouted for the overthrow of the Tarquins.\n\nThe four men gathered the youth of Collatia, then went to Rome where Brutus, being at that time \"Tribunus Celerum\", summoned the people to the forum and exhorted them to rise up against the king. The people voted for the deposition of the king, and the banishment of the royal family.\n\nBrutus summoned the comitia curiata, an organization of patrician families used mainly to ratify the decrees of the king and began to harangue them in one of the more noted and effective speeches of ancient Rome. He began by revealing that his pose as fool was a sham designed to protect him against an evil king. He leveled a number of charges against the king and his family: the outrage against Lucretia, whom everyone could see on the dais, the king's tyranny, the forced labor of the plebeians in the ditches and sewers of Rome. He pointed out that Superbus had come to rule by the murder of Servius Tullius, his wife's father, next-to-the-last king of Rome. He \"solemnly invoked the gods as the avengers of murdered parents.\" The king's wife, Tullia, was in fact in Rome and probably was a witness to the proceedings from her palace near the forum. Seeing herself the target of so much animosity she fled from the palace in fear of her life and proceeded to the camp at Ardea.\n\nBrutus opened a debate on the form of government Rome ought to have; there were many speakers (all patricians). In summation he proposed the banishment of the Tarquins from all the territories of Rome and appointment of an interrex to nominate new magistrates and conduct an election of ratification. They had decided on a republican form of government with two consuls in place of a king executing the will of a patrician senate. This was a temporary measure until they could consider the details more carefully. Brutus renounced all right to the throne. In subsequent years the powers of the king were divided among various elected magistracies. A final vote of the curiae carried the interim constitution. Spurius Lucretius was swiftly elected interrex (he was prefect of the city anyway). He proposed Brutus and Collatinus as the first two consuls and that choice was ratified by the curiae. Needing to acquire the assent of the population as a whole they paraded Lucretia's body through the streets, summoning the plebeians to legal assembly in the forum. Once there they heard a further speech by Brutus. It began:\n\nA general election was held. The vote was for the republic. The monarchy was at an end, even while Lucretia was still displayed in the forum.\n\nBrutus, leaving Lucretius in command of the city, proceeded with armed men to the Roman army then camped at Ardea. The king, who had been with the army, heard of developments at Rome, and left the camp for the city before Brutus' arrival. The army received Brutus as a hero, and the king's sons were expelled from the camp. Tarquinius Superbus, meanwhile, was refused entry at Rome, and fled with his family into exile.\n\nThat uprising resulted in the exile or \"Regifugium\", after a reign of 25 years, of Tarquinius and his family, and the establishment of the Roman Republic, with Brutus and Collatinus (both related by blood to Rome's fifth king Lucius Tarquinius Priscus) as the first consuls.\n\nTarquinius and his two eldest sons, Titus and Arruns, went into exile at Caere.\n\nAccording to Livy, Brutus' first act after the expulsion of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus was to bring the people to swear an oath (the Oath of Brutus) never to allow any man again to be king in Rome.\n\nThis is, fundamentally, a restatement of the \"private oath\" sworn by the conspirators to overthrow the monarchy:\n\nThere is no scholarly agreement that the oath took place; it is reported, although differently, by Plutarch (\"Poplicola\", 2) and Appian (\"B.C.\" 2.119).\n\nBrutus also replenished the number of senators to 300 from the principal men of the equites. The new consuls also created a new office of rex sacrorum to carry out the religious duties that had previously been performed by the kings.\n\nBecause of the Roman people's revulsion at the name and family of the exiled king, the consul Tarquinius Collatinus was forced to resign from the office of consul and go into exile.\n\nAfter his exile, Tarquinius made a number of attempts to regain the throne. At first, he sent ambassadors to the Senate to request the return of his family's personal effects, which had been seized in the coup. In secret, while the Senate debated his request, the ambassadors met with and subverted a number of the leading men of Rome to the royal cause, in the Tarquinian conspiracy. The conspirators included two of Brutus' brothers-in-law, and his two sons Titus and Tiberius. The conspiracy was discovered, and the conspirators executed.\n\nAlthough the Senate had initially agreed to Tarquin's request for a return of his family's effects, the decision was reconsidered and revoked after the discovery of the conspiracy, and the royal property was given over to be plundered by the Roman populace.\n\nTarquinius next attempted to regain Rome by force of arms. He first gained the support of the cities of Veii and Tarquinii, recalling to the former their regular losses of war and land to the Roman state, and to the latter his family ties. The armies of the two cities were led by Tarquinius against Rome in the Battle of Silva Arsia. The king commanded the Etruscan infantry. Although the result initially appeared uncertain, the Romans were victorious. Both Brutus (the consul) and Arruns (the king's son) were killed in battle.\n\nAnother attempt by Tarquinius relied on military support from Lars Porsenna, king of Clusium. The war led to the siege of Rome, and finally a peace treaty. However, Tarquinius failed to achieve his aim of regaining the throne.\n\nTarquinius and his family left Clusium, and instead sought refuge in Tusculum with his son-in-law Octavius Mamilius. In about 496 BC, Tarquin and his son Titus fought with Mamilius and the Latin League against Rome, but lost, at the Battle of Lake Regillus at which Mamilius perished.\n\nSubsequently, Tarquinius fled to take refuge with the tyrant of Cumae, Aristodemus and Tarquin died there in 495 BC.\n"}

It is the finale of Monterey Car Week held in August every year. A \"Concours d'Elegance\" (French, literally \"a competition of elegance\") is an event open to both prewar and postwar collector cars in which they are judged for authenticity, function, history, and style. Classes are commonly arranged by type, marque (manufacturer), coachbuilder, country of origin, or time period. Judges select first-, second-, and third-place finishers for each class in the event, and the judges confer the \"Best of Show\" award on one car from the group of first-place winners. In addition, a group of honorary judges—individuals who have made significant contributions to the automotive industry or motorsports—award a number of subjective awards to recognize standout vehicles regardless of class ribbons, as well as memorial awards created to honor specific automotive industry personages. Approximately 15,000 spectators attend the event.\n\nThe Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance was founded in 1950 as an adjunct to the Pebble Beach Road Race, a race event sponsored by the Sports Car Club of America and conducted on a circuit of closed public roads. The 1950 and 1951 Concours were held on a practice tee and driving range adjacent to the Beach Club, a private club near the Del Monte Lodge (now known as \"The Lodge at Pebble Beach\"). Thirty cars were exhibited on November 4, 1950, and a smaller field of 23 on May 27, 1951. In 1952, the event was moved to the 18th green of the Pebble Beach Golf Links, between the Lodge at Pebble Beach and the Pacific Ocean, overlooking Carmel Bay.\n\nThe Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance has continued since 1950 with one missed year: in 1960, the show was cancelled due to scheduling conflicts. In addition, heavy rain at the event in 1963 and 1965 made the lawn area unusable, and so the cars were shown at the old start/finish line of the road race, near the horse stables now known as the Pebble Beach Equestrian Center.\n\nIn 2001, the event saw an introduction of a new category for preservation cars. This category was designed to \"bear witness to the passage of time\", including the so-called barn find car.\n\nThe 2006 event saw 175 cars lining the 18th green and hole of Pebble Beach Golf Links with 25 judged classes, with cars brought to Pebble Beach from 27 states and 13 countries (including the U.S.). The event describes itself as \"Exhibiting prewar and postwar automobiles along with the latest in concept car designs, the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance is the premiere concours in the world.\"\n\n24 of the 175 cars in the field come from outside the U.S, representing Italy, England, France, Switzerland, Australia, China, Germany, Mexico, Czech Republic, Netherlands, and the Philippines. The total estimated cost of the vehicles spread across the 18th fairway at the 2006 event was US$200 million. From 227 cars in 2005, the 2006 event had a field reduced to 175 cars. Organizers said the change was made to allow more time to judge each car.\n\nIn 2009, the Pebble Beach Concours included classic motorcycles for the first time under the theme of pre-1959 British Motorcycles.\n\nThe Concours received the 2011 Motoring Event of the Year award by the International Historic Motoring Awards.\n\nEach year's Pebble Beach Concours honors a featured marque (manufacturer), coachbuilder, or type.\n\nProspective entrants must submit an application for each car, and the Concours field is selected from each year's pool of applicants. Many collectors spend years and hundreds of thousands of dollars purchasing and restoring a car in hopes of being chosen. Once a car is accepted to the Concours, it cannot again be entered in the event for ten years, with three exceptions; the ownership of the car has changed, the car has been restored, or if the featured marque is obscure, the Concours car selection committee can reach out to invite cars of varying restoration quality—or cars that have previously been entered in the Concours—in order to provide a healthy representation of the marque for exhibition.\n\nMany of the competing cars are valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and more recently into the millions of dollars. For this reason, along with its remarkable setting and amenities, the Pebble Beach Concours is considered the premier concours in the world, and is the centerpiece of over 50 related events spanning over a week, including vintage racing cars running at the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion (formerly called the Monterey Historic Automobile Races) conducted at nearby WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca, as well as classic car auctions.\n\nDue to the extreme cost of purchasing, restoring, and maintaining fine classic cars, the Pebble Beach Concours is sometimes perceived to be the realm of the very wealthy, or dedicated enthusiasts and those individuals and businesses that cater to their interests. To the repeat participants, their guests, and thousands of attendees, the Pebble Beach Concours is as much a social gathering as a special interest event. From postwar Ferraris to historic Bentleys, the Concours assembles a stylish mix of historic automobiles alongside new vehicle presentations from car manufacturers, art exhibitions, auctions, and charity raffles.\n\nThe proceeds of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance have supported the United Way of Monterey County and the Pebble Beach Company Foundation for a combination of 56 years. It also supports a number of other local and national organizations.\n\nThe 2016 event raised over $1.75 million, and the Concours has given more than $23 million to charities through the years.\n\n\n"}

It had ceased to be a member of the Achaean League in the time of Polybius, who mentions Leontium in its place. Rhypes, however, continued to exist down to the time of Augustus; but this emperor destroyed the city and transferred its inhabitants to Patrae, and its territory (Ῥυπίς, or ἡ Ῥυπική) was divided between Aegium and Pharae.

The Royal Dramatic Theatre (the national stage) and the Cullberg Ballet, for example, tours regularly with Riksteatern with many of their most popular productions.\n\nRiksteatern (or \"the Riksteater\") was established in 1933 by Arthur Engberg. \"Not only the citizens of the capital city in Sweden should be granted the privilege of first class theatre productions. The rest of the nation also has the right to claim this!\" - with these words, after a long public debate, Riksteatern was given the proper state funding and support. At first Riksteatern, in the 1930s, was supposed to be the touring section of Sweden's Royal Dramatic Theatre, in an effort to reach an audience in Sweden that couldn't get the chance to visit the national stage in Stockholm. However, in the 1940s Riksteatern was given their own ensemble, producing stage productions solely for Riksteatern and with the purpose to be given on-tour.\n\nIn 1966 Riksteatern was corporatized with Sweden's second influential touring theatre organization Svenska Teatern and became \"Svenska Riksteatern\".

{"id": "25893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25893", "title": "Robert Fripp", "text": "Robert Fripp\n\nRobert Fripp (born 16 May 1946) is an English guitarist, composer and record producer. As a guitarist for the progressive rock band King Crimson, Fripp has been the only member to have played in all of King Crimson's line-ups from their inception in the late 1960s to the present. He has also worked extensively as a studio musician, notably with singer David Bowie on the albums \"\"Heroes\"\" and \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\", Brian Eno, David Sylvian and contributed sounds to the Windows Vista operating system. His complete discography lists more than seven hundred releases over four decades.\n\nHe is ranked 62nd on \"Rolling Stone\" magazine's 2011 list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time after having been ranked by David Fricke 42nd on its 2003 list. Tied with Andrés Segovia, he also is ranked 47th on Gibson's Top 50 guitarists of all time.\n\nHis compositions often feature unusual time signatures, which have been influenced by classical and folk traditions. His innovations include Frippertronics, soundscapes, and new standard tuning.\n\nThe son of an estate agent from a working-class background, Robert Fripp was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England. On Christmas Day 1957, aged 11, he got a \"very cheap\" guitar from his parents, saying \"almost immediately I knew that this guitar was going to be my life\". Fripp took guitar lessons with teachers Kathleen Gartell and Don Strike, which quickly advanced his skills: at 11 years of age, he was playing rock, moving on to traditional jazz at 13 and modern jazz at 15. At this time he was influenced by such jazz players and composers as Charlie Parker and Charlie Mingus.\n\nDespite his jazz inclinations, Fripp's first band was a rock band called The Ravens, formed in 1961 when he was 15 and also featuring schoolmates Graham Wale (drums, subsequently replaced by Chris 'Fergy' Ferguson), Gordon Haskell (bass guitar), and Tino Licinio (vocals/guitar). In 1962 The Ravens split as Fripp concentrated on his O-level studies and joined his father's firm as a junior negotiator, at this point planning to study estate management and eventually take over his father's business. By 1964, aged 17, Fripp made the decision to become a professional musician.\n\nFor a while, Fripp played guitar in the Chewton Glen Hotel with a jazz band called The Douglas Ward Trio. Soon afterwards, he formed a rock and roll band called The League of Gentlemen (a name he would resurrect in 1980 for an entirely different band). In addition to Fripp on guitar, the lineup of the 1964 League of Gentlemen included his former Ravens bandmates Gordon Haskell and Tino Licinio, plus Stan Levy (drums) and Reg Matthews (vocals).\n\nStill keeping his options open, Fripp left The League of Gentlemen in 1965 in order to study for A-levels at Bournemouth College, where he studied economics, economic history and political history, writing a special paper on social conditions of the mid-to-late 19th century; it was there where he met future musical colleagues John Wetton, Richard Palmer-James and Greg Lake. He subsequently spent three further years playing light jazz in the Majestic Dance Orchestra at the Bournemouth Majestic Hotel (replacing future The Police guitarist Andy Summers, who had gone off to London with Zoot Money). At age 21, going back home from college late at night, Fripp tuned on to Radio Luxemburg where he heard the last moments of \"A Day in the Life\". \"Galvanized\" by the experience, he went on to listen to \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", Béla Bartók's string quartets, Antonín Dvořák's \"New World Symphony\", Jimi Hendrix's \"Are You Experienced\" and John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Many years later, Fripp would recall that \"although all the dialects are different, the voice was the same... I knew I couldn't say no\".\n\nSeeking to develop a more creative musical career, Fripp responded to an advertisement placed by Bournemouth brothers Peter Giles (bass guitar, vocals) and Michael Giles (drums, vocals), in which they hoped to recruit a singing organist. Despite being neither of these things, Fripp successfully auditioned for the brothers: the trio subsequently relocated to London and formed Giles, Giles and Fripp. Though ultimately unsuccessful as a live act, the band gained some attention following the release of two singles as well as an album (\"The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp\"). Despite the recruitment of two further members - singer Judy Dyble (formerly with Fairport Convention and later of Trader Horne) and multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald - Fripp felt that he was outgrowing the eccentric pop approach favoured by Peter Giles (preferring the more ambitious compositions being written by McDonald) and the band broke up in 1968.\n\nAlmost immediately, Fripp, McDonald and Michael Giles formed the first lineup of King Crimson in mid-1968, recruiting Fripp's old Bournemouth College friend Greg Lake as lead singer and bass player, and McDonald's writing partner Peter Sinfield as lyricist, light show designer and general creative consultant. King Crimson's debut album, \"In the Court of the Crimson King\", was released in late 1969 to great success: drawing on rock, jazz and European folk/classical music ideas, it is regarded as one of the most influential albums in the history of progressive rock. The band was tipped for stardom but (due to growing musical differences between Fripp on one side and Giles and McDonald on the other) broke up at the end of its first American tour in 1969. A despondent Fripp offered to leave the group if it would allow King Crimson to survive; however, Giles and McDonald had independently decided that the band's music was \"more Fripp's than theirs\" and that it would be better if they were the ones to leave.\n\nDuring the recording of the band's second album \"In the Wake of Poseidon\" Greg Lake departed to form Emerson, Lake and Palmer, leaving Fripp and Sinfield as the only remaining founder members. They issued two more albums (\"Lizard\" and \"Islands\") and were the only constants in a regularly changing King Crimson lineup. It included (at various times) Gordon Haskell, saxophonist/flute player Mel Collins, drummers Andy McCulloch and Ian Wallace and future Bad Company bass player Boz Burrell, in addition to a palette of guest players from Soft Machine, Keith Tippett's band, Brotherhood of Breath and Centipede. Fripp was listed as the sole composer of the band's music during this time, which built on the first album's blueprint but progressed further into jazz rock and free jazz while also taking form from Sinfield's esoteric lyrical and mythological concepts.\n\nIn 1971, Fripp ousted Sinfield and took over \"de facto\" leadership of King Crimson (although he has always formally rejected the label, preferring to describe his role as \"quality control\" or \"a kind of glue\"). From this point onwards, Fripp would be the only constant member of the band, which in turn would be defined primarily by his compositional and conceptual ideas (which drew on avant-garde jazz and improvisation mixed with a variety of hard rock and European influences, in particular the music of Béla Bartók). With avant-garde percussionist Jamie Muir, violinist David Cross, singing bass player John Wetton and former Yes drummer Bill Bruford now in the ranks, King Crimson produced three more albums of innovative and increasingly experimental rock, shedding members as they progressed: beginning with \"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\", progressing with \"Starless and Bible Black\" and culminating in the benchmark avant-power trio album \"Red\". Fripp formally disbanded the group in 1974, in what eventually turned out to be merely the first in a regular series of long hiatuses and further transformations.\n\nDuring King Crimson's less active periods, Fripp pursued a number of side-projects. He worked with Keith Tippett (and others who appeared on King Crimson records) on projects far from rock music, playing with and producing Centipede's \"Septober Energy\" in 1971 and \"Ovary Lodge\" in 1973. During this period he also worked with Van der Graaf Generator, playing on the 1970 album \"H to He, Who Am the Only One\", and in 1971, on \"Pawn Hearts\". He produced Matching Mole's 2nd LP \"Matching Mole's Little Red Record\" in 1972. Prior to forming the \"Larks\"-era KC, he collaborated on a spoken-word album with a woman he described as \"a witch\" but the resulting recording - \"Robert Fripp & Walli Elmark: The Cosmic Children Of Love\" - was never officially released.\n\nCollaborating with Brian Eno, Fripp recorded \"(No Pussyfooting)\" in 1972, and \"Evening Star\" in 1974. These two albums featured experimentation with several avant-garde musical techniques which were new to rock music, including a tape delay system utilising dual reel to reel Revox tape machines that would come to play a central role in Fripp's later work. This system came to be known as \"Frippertronics\". In 1973, Fripp performed the guitar solo on \"Baby's on Fire\", perhaps the best-known track on Eno's debut solo album \"Here Come the Warm Jets\". In 1975, Fripp and Brian Eno played several live shows in Europe, and Fripp also contributed guitar solos throughout Eno's landmark album, \"Another Green World\".\n\nFripp started what was intended as a permanent sabbatical from his career in 1975, during which he cultivated an interest in the teachings of Gurdjieff via J. G. Bennett (studies which would later be influential in his work with Guitar Craft). He returned to musical work as a studio guitarist on Peter Gabriel's first self-titled album in 1976, released the following year. Fripp toured with Gabriel to support the album, but remained out of sight (either in the wings or behind a curtain) and used the pseudonym \"Dusty Rhodes.\" He produced and played on Gabriel's second album in 1978.\n\nIn 1977, Fripp received a phone call from Eno, who was working on David Bowie's album \"\"Heroes\"\". Fripp and Eno had collaborated on an album released in 1975 called \"Evening Star\". On this album and in particular on the recording \"An Index of Metals\" there are strains that would influence the Bowie project two years later - most notably Side Two of the Bowie album. Fripp agreed to play guitar for Bowie's \"Heroes\" album, a move that initiated a series of collaborations with other musicians. Fripp soon collaborated with Daryl Hall on \"Sacred Songs\".\n\nDuring this period, Fripp began working on solo material, with contributions from poet/lyricist Joanna Walton and several other musicians, including Eno, Gabriel, and Hall (including the latter's partner, John Oates), as well as Peter Hammill, Jerry Marotta, Phil Collins, Tony Levin and Terre Roche. This material eventually became his first solo album, \"Exposure\", released in 1979, followed by the \"Frippertronics\" tour in the same year.\n\nWhile living in New York, Fripp contributed to albums and live performances by Blondie (\"Parallel Lines\") and Talking Heads (\"Fear of Music\"), and produced The Roches' first and third albums, which featured several of Fripp's characteristic guitar solos. A second set of creative sessions with David Bowie produced distinctive guitar parts on \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\" (1980) and prior to that, Peter Gabriel's third solo album known as 'Melt'. With Blondie, Fripp appeared live on stage at Hammersmith Odeon on 12 January 1980 participating in the band's cover version of Bowie's \"Heroes\". This recording was on the 12\" single of \"Atomic\" released the same year and later turned up as a bonus track on CD pressings of Blondie's album \"Eat to the Beat\".\n\nFripp's collaboration with bassist Busta Jones, drummer Paul Duskin, and vocals by David Byrne (Byrne credited as Absalm el Habib) produced \"God Save the Queen/Under Heavy Manners\" in the following year. He simultaneously assembled what he called a \"second-division touring new wave instrumental dance band\" under the name League of Gentlemen, with bassist Sara Lee, keyboardist Barry Andrews and drummer Johnny Toobad (later replaced by Kevin Wilkinson). The LOG toured for the duration of 1980.\n\nIn 1985 he produced the album \"Journey to Inaccessible Places\" by classical pianist Elan Sicroff, released on the Editions E.G. label.\n\n1981 saw the formation of a new King Crimson lineup, reuniting Fripp with drummer Bill Bruford and opening a new partnership with two American musicians: bass guitarist/Chapman Stick player Tony Levin (who had played with Fripp on \"Exposure\" and in the first Peter Gabriel touring band) and Adrian Belew, a singer and guitarist who had previously played with Bowie, Talking Heads and Frank Zappa. Although the band had been conceptualised under the name Discipline it came to Fripp's attention that the other members thought the name King Crimson was more appropriate: for Fripp, King Crimson had always been \"a way of doing things\" rather than a particular group of musicians, and the current group felt that their music captured that methodology. With the more pop-inspired Belew as main songwriter (complementing Fripp as main instrumental composer) the band took on a new style incorporating a gamelan-inspired continuo minimalism, New York influences from post-punk to go-go, and textured experiments with guitar synthesizers. After releasing three albums (\"Discipline\", \"Beat\", \"Three of a Perfect Pair\"), this new King Crimson broke up in 1984.\n\nDuring this period Fripp made two records with his old friend Andy Summers of The Police. On \"I Advance Masked\", Fripp and Summers played all the instruments. \"Bewitched\" was dominated more by Summers, who produced the record and collaborated with other musicians in addition to Fripp.\n\nIn 1982 Fripp produced and played guitar on \"Keep on Doing\" by The Roches. As in his previous guesting on David Bowie's \"Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)\" (which also featured Pete Townshend and Chuck Hammer on guitar synthesizer), Fripp's distinctive guitar style and sound that characterised his music of this period is featured alongside the sisters' songs and harmony.\n\nFripp was offered a teaching position at the American Society for Continuous Education (ASCE) in Claymont Court, West Virginia in 1984. He had been involved with the ASCE since 1978, eventually serving on its board of directors, and had long been considering the idea of teaching guitar. His course, Guitar Craft, was begun in 1985, an offshoot of which was a performance group, \"The League of Crafty Guitarists\", which has released several albums. In 1986, he released the first of two collaborations with his wife, Toyah Willcox. The members of the California Guitar Trio are former members of The League of Crafty Guitarists and have also toured with King Crimson. Fripp is the patron of the Guitar Circle of Europe, which was founded in 2007, and of the Seattle Circle Guitar School, which was founded in 2010.\n\nIn February 2009, Fripp recommended that Guitar Craft cease to exist on its 25th anniversary in 2010.\n\nFripp returned to recording solo in 1994, using an updated version of the Frippertronics technique that creates loops employing digital technology instead of analogue tapes. Fripp has released a number of records that he called \"Soundscapes\", including \"1999\", \"Radiophonics\", \"A Blessing of Tears\", \"That Which Passes\", \"November Suite\", \"The Gates of Paradise\", \"Love Cannot Bear\" and \"At the End of Time\", as well as numerous download-only live recordings. (The sampler \"Pie Jesu\" consists of material compiled from \"A Blessing of Tears\" and \"The Gates of Paradise\".)\n\nFripp's collaborations with David Sylvian feature some of his most exuberant guitar playing. Fripp contributed to Sylvian's twenty-minute track \"Steel Cathedrals\" from his \"\" album of 1985. Then Fripp performed on several tracks from Sylvian's 1986 release, \"Gone to Earth\".\n\nIn late 1991, Fripp had asked Sylvian to join a re-forming King Crimson as a vocalist. Sylvian declined the invitation, but proposed a possible collaboration between the two that would eventually become a tour of Japan and Italy in the spring of 1992.\n\nIn July 1993, Sylvian and Fripp released the collaborative effort \"The First Day\". Other contributors were soon-to-be King Crimson member Trey Gunn on Chapman Stick and Jerry Marotta (who, like Sylvian, almost became a member of King Crimson) on drums. When the group toured to promote the CD, future King Crimson member Pat Mastelotto took over the drumming spot. The live document \"Damage\" was released in 1994, as was the joint venture, \"Redemption – Approaching Silence\", which featured Sylvian's ambient sound sculptures (Approaching Silence) accompanying Fripp reading his own text (Redemption).\n\nDuring the early and mid-1990s Fripp contributed guitar/soundscapes to \"Lifeforms\" (1994) by the Future Sound of London and \"Cydonia\" (released 2001) by the Orb, as well as \"FFWD\", a collaborative effort with the latter's members. In addition, Fripp worked with Brian Eno co-writing and supplying guitar to two tracks for a CD-ROM project released in 1994 entitled \"Headcandy\" created by Chris Juul and Doug Jipson. Eno thought the visual aspects of the disc (video feedback effects) were very disappointing upon completion, and regretted participation. During this period, Fripp also contributed to albums by No-Man and the Beloved (1994's \"Flowermouth\" and 1996's \"X\", respectively). He also contributed soundscapes and guitar to two albums by the UK band Iona: 1993's \"Beyond These Shores\" and 1996's \"Journey into the Morn\".\n\nIn late 1994, Fripp re-formed the 1981 line-up of King Crimson for its fifth incarnation, adding Trey Gunn and drummer Pat Mastelotto in a configuration known as the \"double trio\" (the line-up included two guitars, two bass/Stick players and two drummers). This line-up released the \"VROOOM\" EP in 1994, and the \"Thrak\" album in 1995.\n\nThough musically (and relatively commercially) successful, the double-trio King Crimson proved difficult to sustain in the long-term. From 1997 to 1999, the band \"fraKctalised\" into five experimental instrumental sub-groups known as . By 1998 Bruford had quit the band altogether: in 2000, Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto reunited as a four-piece King Crimson (minus Levin, who was busy with session work). This lineup produced two studio albums, \"the construKction of light\" in 2000 and \"The Power to Believe\" in 2003, which took on a more metallic, heavily electronic approach. Gunn departed at the end of 2003.\n\nAlthough Levin immediately returned to the band, another hiatus followed until King Crimson reappeared in 2007 with a second drummer - Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree - appended to the lineup, This version of the band played a brief eastern USA tour in 2008, reassessing its 1981-2003 back catalogue and approach and introducing lengthy percussion duets between the two drummers. No new original material was recorded, and in 2010, Fripp announced that King Crimson were on another indefinite hiatus.\n\nDuring 2004, Fripp toured with Joe Satriani and Steve Vai as the guitar trio G3. He also worked at Microsoft's studios to record new sounds and atmospheres for Windows Vista.\n\nIn late 2005 and early 2006, Fripp joined sometime R.E.M./Nine Inch Nails drummer Bill Rieflin's improvisational Slow Music project, along with guitarist Peter Buck, Fred Chalenor (acoustic bass), Matt Chamberlain (drums) and Hector Zazou (electronics). This collective of musicians toured the west coast of America in May 2006.\n\nIn 2006 Fripp contributed his composition \"At The End Of Time\" to the Artists for Charity album \"Guitarists 4 the Kids\", produced by Slang Productions, to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged children. Throughout 2006, Fripp would perform many solo concerts of soundscapes in intimate settings, especially in churches around the West Midlands in England, where he lives. In October 2006, ProjeKct Six (Robert Fripp, Adrian Belew) played at select venues on the east coast of the U.S., opening for Porcupine Tree. In the same year, Fripp contributed soundscapes to two songs for Porcupine Tree's \"Fear of a Blank Planet\" - \"Way Out of Here\" and \"Nil Recurring,\" the second of which was released in September 2007 as part of the \"Nil Recurring\" EP. Fripp also sporadically performed Soundscapes as an opening act for Porcupine Tree on various tours from 2006 through 2009.\n\nIn 2008, Fripp collaborated with Theo Travis on an album of guitar and flute-or-saxophone duets called 'Thread', and the duo played a brief English tour in 2009 (repeating the collaboration with the \"Follow\" album in 2012). Also in 2009, Fripp played a concert with the band The Humans (which consists of his wife Toyah Willcox, Bill Rieflin and Chris Wong), appeared on Judy Dyble's \"Talking With Strangers\" (along with Pat Mastelotto and others) and played on two tracks on Jakko Jakszyk's album \"The Bruised Romantic Glee Club\". In 2010, Fripp contributed a guitar solo to an extended version of the song 'Heathen Child' by Grinderman, released as a B-side on the 'Super Heathen Child' single.\n\nIn May 2011, Jakko Jakszyk, Robert Fripp and Mel Collins released a song album called \"A Scarcity of Miracles: A King Crimson ProjeKct\" on the Panegyric label. The album also featured contributions by Tony Levin and Gavin Harrison, leading to speculation that the project was a dry run for a new King Crimson.\n\nIn an interview published 3 August 2012, Fripp stated that he had retired from working as a professional musician, citing long-standing differences with Universal Music Group and stating that working within the music industry had become \"a joyless exercise in futility\". This retirement proved to be short-lived, lasting as long as it took to come to a settlement with UMG.\n\nIn his online diary entry for 6 September 2013, Fripp announced the return of King Crimson as a seven-piece unit with \"four Englishmen and three Americans\". The new lineup was Fripp, Levin, both Mastelotto and Harrison on drums, returning 1970s band member Mel Collins and two new members: Jakko Jakszyk as singer and second guitarist, and Bill Rieflin as a third drummer. This version of the band went on tour in 2014 and 2015 with a setlist reworking and reconfiguring the band's 1960s and 1970s material (plus songs from \"A Scarcity of Miracles\" and new compositions). In early 2016, it was announced that former Lemon Trees/Beady Eye drummer Jeremy Stacy would substitute for Rieflin on that year's tour, while the latter was on a musical sabbatical.\n\nDuring the early years of King Crimson (1968–74), Fripp used two Gibson Les Paul guitars from 1957 and 1959. The '57 guitar featured three humbucker pick-ups (with one volume control on the pickguard controlling the middle pick-up).\nA signature model named for the guitarist (Crimson Guitars Robert Fripp Signature) features Fernandes Sustainer and MIDI elements, with a Les Paul Model Body. Another difference from the Gibson Les Paul is that Fripp's guitar is built using a deep set neck tenon rather than a traditional set neck.\n\nFripp recommended that Guitar Craft students adopt the Ovation 1867 Legend steel-string guitar, which had a shallow body. \"Fripp liked the way the Ovation 1867 fitted against his body, which made it possible for him to assume the right-arm picking position he had developed using electric guitars over the years; on deeper-bodied guitars, the Frippian arm position is impossible without uncomfortable contortions\", according to Tamm. While the 1867 Legend is no longer manufactured, it influenced the design of the Guitar Craft Pro Model of Guitar Craft Guitars, which has been endorsed by Fripp.\n\nFripp began playing guitar at the age of eleven. When he started, he was tone deaf and had no rhythmical sense, weaknesses which led him later to comment \"Music so wishes to be heard that it sometimes calls on unlikely characters to give it voice.\" He was also naturally left-handed but opted to play the guitar right-handed.\n\nWhile being taught guitar basics by his teacher Don Strike, Fripp began to develop the technique of crosspicking, which became one of his specialities. Fripp teaches crosspicking to his students in Guitar Craft.\n\nIn 1985, Fripp began using a tuning he called \"New Standard tuning\" (C2-G2-D3-A3-E4-G4), which would also become popularised in Guitar Craft.\n\nFripp's guitar technique, unlike most rock guitarists of his era, is not blues-based but rather influenced by avant-garde jazz and European classical music. He combines rapid alternate picking and crosspicking with motifs employing whole-tone or diminished pitch structures and sixteenth-note patterns for long stretches in a form called \"moto perpetuo\" (perpetual motion).\n\nRather than stand when performing, he seats himself on a stool (unusual for a performer in rock music), and by doing so was called in a May 1974 issue of \"Guitar Player\" \"the guitarist who sits on stage.\"\n\nMany artists have cited Fripp as an influence or have expressed their admiration for him, including Steven Wilson, Omar Rodríguez-López, Trey Anastasio of Phish, St. Vincent, Kirk Hammett of Metallica, Michael Angelo Batio, Geoff Tate of Queensrÿche, Nels Cline of Wilco, Adam Jones of Tool, Merzbow, Vernon Reid of Living Colour, Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan, Paul Masvidal of Cynic, Steve Stevens of Billy Idol, Chris Haskett of Rollins Band, Ivar Bjørnson of Enslaved, Dylan Carlson of Earth, Dan Briggs, Denis \"Piggy\" D'Amour of Voivod, Daniel Mongrain, Marcus Henderson, Paul Lemos of Controlled Bleeding, Richard Pinhas, Nick Reinhart of Tera Melos, Leopold Ross, electronic musician Rustie, film director Hal Hartley, and Sean Beavan.\n\nFripp married Toyah Willcox in 1986 in Poole, Dorset, England. From December 1987 until July 1999 they lived at and renovated Reddish House, the former home of Cecil Beaton, in Broad Chalke Wiltshire. At present his home is in Pershore, Worcestershire. The couple have no children and have arranged their will so as to leave their entire fortune to the establishment of a musical educational trust for children. \n\nFripp is the patron of the Seattle Circle Guitar School and the Shallal Dance Theatre in Penzance, England. He also has had engagements as a motivational speaker, often at events with his sister Patricia, who is a keynote speaker and speech coach.\n\nAlfie Fripp, the last of the \"39ers\", shot down by the Luftwaffe and then held in 12 different POW camps during World War II, was his uncle.\n\nFripp is a pescetarian.\n\nIn 1992, Fripp and producer/online content developer David Singleton co-founded Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) as an independent music label. DGM releases music by Fripp, KC, related acts, and other artists in CDs and in downloadable files. A 1998 \"Billboard\" profile stated that DGM had ten staff-members in Salisbury (England) and Los Angeles (USA). DGM has an aim \"to be a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed.\" DGM insists that its artists retain all copyrights; consequently, even DGM's \"knotwork\" corporate-logo \"(pictured above)\" is owned by its designer, Steve Ball; the \"knotwork\" logo appeared earlier on the cover of later versions of the \"Discipline\" album. DGM's aims were called \"exemplary\" by , who wrote that \"Fripp has done something very important for the possibilities of experimental music\" in creating DGM, which \"has played a major role in creating favorable conditions for\" King Crimson.\n\nDGM publishes an on-line diary by Fripp, who often comments on performances and on relations with fans. A moderated forum allows fans to ask questions or to leave comments. Together, Fripp's diary and the fan forum display delayed dialogs in which Fripp and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings.\n\nIn 2011, Fripp complained that the music-distribution service Grooveshark continued to stream his music despite his having delivered repeated takedown notices. Fripp and Grooveshark's correspondence was published by \"Digital Music News\" and in his diaries, which appear on the website of Discipline Global Mobile.\n\nFripp's published exchange was included in a suit against Grooveshark by Universal Music Group, which was filed in November 2011. UMG cited internal documents revealing that Grooveshark employees uploaded thousands of illegal copies of UMG-owned recordings. Fripp had previous experience protecting his music in litigation with music companies.\n\nFripp has been extremely active as a recording musician and a producer. He has contributed to more than 700 official releases. The Robert Fripp Discography Summary, compiled by John Relph, also lists 120 compilations and 315 unauthorised releases (such as bootlegs). This means that more than 1100 releases (including both official and unofficial ones, as well as both studio and live recordings) can be found with Fripp participating. Studio releases are listed here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Of the county's twelve Members at the Long Parliament called in 1640, eight would fight on the Royalist side and four for Parliament. Control of the area was important to the King as Shropshire was a gateway to predominantly Royalist Wales as well as to keep in contact with the north-western counties and the western port links with Ireland. Parliamentary control of Shropshire was achieved after the capture of its last Royalist garrison by Parliament in 1646.\n\nThe week after raising his standard at Nottingham, Charles I proceeded into Shropshire, arriving in Wellington on 19 September. On 20 September he issued the Wellington Declaration promising to preserve the Protestant religion, laws, and liberties of his subjects, and the privileges of Parliament, and inspected his troops below the Wrekin.\nFrom Wellington he marched to Shrewsbury, where he was joined by his two sons, the Prince of Wales and James, Prince Rupert, and great numbers of noblemen and gentlemen, and established a mint in the town. He remained there until 12 October, when he marched to Bridgnorth, and from there advanced to Edge Hill, in Warwickshire, where the first pitched battle of the First Civil War was fought.\n\nIn January the king formally appointed Sir Francis Ottley as governor of Shrewsbury.\n\nIn counteraction to the king, the Parliamentarians, including some Shropshire gentry, formed their Committee of Association for Warwickshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire in April 1643.\n\nIn August Parliament garrisoned Wem. It was threatened by Royalist forces under Lord Capel, who were forced to retreat by a Parliamentary army arriving from Chester.\n\nOn 28 December 1643 Tong Castle was captured by Parliamentarian troops from Eccleshall, Staffordshire.\n\nOn 13 March 1644 Hopton Castle was captured by the Royalists. The Parliamentary commander, Colonel More, did not surrender until after the final assault. The Royalist commander Sir Michael Woodhouse, at his digression (his prerogative under the laws of war as they were practised at that time), decided not to grant the majority of his prisoners quarter and they were killed by their captors. However the Parliamentary side believed for some months that prior to the surrender terms had been agreed which included the sparing of the lives of the garrison and so the killings were a breach of the law of war. It was not until October that year the Colonel More's account was published, setting the record straight, but not in time to prevent Parliamentary propaganda vilifying the Royalists for their alleged Perfidy.\nOn 3 April Longford House was captured by the Royalists.\n\nOn 6 April Tong Castle was captured by the Royalists under the command of Prince Rupert.\n\nIn June the king was in Shrewsbury during the campaign that led to the Battle of Cropredy Bridge. The same month Oswestry was taken from the Royalists by the Earl of Denbigh. The inhabitants gave £500 to prevent the Parliamentary soldiers from plundering.\n\nIn July Oswestry was besieged by the Royalists under Colonel Marrowe, but it was relieved by Sir Thomas Middleton, who took Lord Newport's eldest son, Francis, and 200 men prisoners.\n\nBy August, Prince Rupert had Sir Francis Ottley replaced as royal governor of Shrewsbury by Sir Fulke Hunckes, who, becoming locally unpopular, was later that year replaced by Sir Michael Earnley.\n\nIn early October, Sir William Vaughan, the Royalist governor of Shrawardine Castle, was captured by Mytton while receiving the sacrament in Shrawardine church. He was allowed back into the castle on pretext of negotiating the garrison's surrender, but tricked Mytton by raising the drawbridge and broke his parole. By the winter Vaughan was appointed general of Shropshire, and quartered his regiment around the county, leaving his parson brother James in charge of Shrawardine.\n\nIn February Apley House was taken by the Parliamentarians under Sir John Price, when Sir William and Sir Thomas Whitmore, Sir Francis Ottley, and about 60 men, were made prisoners.\n\nOn 9 February the Royalist garrison in Shrewsbury Castle was surprised. The town's governor, Sir Michael Earnley, was slain, 15 pieces of ordnance, about 60 gentlemen, and 200 soldiers, were taken by Mytton, the Parliamentarian Governor of Wem. On 23 February Parliament captured Shrewsbury, and in the same month they also captured Benthall Hall from the Royalists.\n\nOn 10 June there was a battle at Stokesay, near Ludlow. The Royalists were defeated, and Sir William Croft was slain by the Parliamentarians. Stokesay Castle was captured, and Caus Castle and Shrawardine also fell to Parliament the same month.\n\nOn 4 and 5 July, Sir William Vaughan won two significant victories, resulting in the relief of the besieged garrison of High Ercall.\n\nIn August a Parliamentarian pamphlet listed the royalist garrisons of castles in Shropshire. These included Bridgnorth, Broncroft, Caus, Dawley, Lee, Ludlow, Moreton Corbet, Oswestry, Rowton, Shrawardine, Stokesay and Tong. The garrisons at Dawley Castle and Lilleshall Abbey fell the same month, and Morton Corbet Castle in September, to Parliament.\n\nAfter a one-month siege the Royalist garrison of Bridgnorth Castle surrendered to the Parliamentarians.\n\nOn 28 March the Royalist garrison of High Ercall, under Sir Vincent Corbet, capitulated. The articles of surrender allowed the garrison to depart for Worcester, albeit without their weapons.\n\nOn 9 July the Royalist garrison of Ludlow surrendered to Sir William Brereton.\n\nFear of Royalist uprisings lead to Parliament ordering Shrewsbury re-garrisoned.\n\nAt 3 o'clock in the morning of 4 September Charles II and the Earl of Derby arrived at White Ladies Priory, fleeing from the fatal battle of Worcester. Charles had his hair cut off, and was disguised in the clothes of the resident Pendrills. Hence he was conducted to Boscobel House, where he was concealed during the night, and in the day time he hid himself with Colonel Careless in the Royal Oak. From Boscobel he was conducted by the five faithful brothers, the Pendrills, to Mr. Whitgrave's house, at Moseley, in Staffordshire.\n\nOn 15 October 1651 Captain John Benbow, uncle to the renowned admiral, was shot on the Shrewsbury Castle's green.\n\nSir Thomas Harries, in an abortive royalist uprising, fails to capture Shrewsbury Castle in a surprise attack.\n\n\n"}

It is part of the Bon Festival. During the event, the souls of the deceased are mourned and sent off.\n\nThe procession takes place on August 15 of every year. During the procession, people float boats which are said to be carrying the spirits of the deceased down the river. The spirits are said to be sent to Sukhavati. It is done as an act of mourning by those who have lost a family member in the past year, though people who are not mourning participate as well. \n\nAs with many other Japanese festivals, people carry firecrackers and gongs, and often sound off with kakegoe. Some boats are built up to look like festival floats, and many tourists come to see the event. Despite the atmosphere, the procession is actually a Buddhist event of mourning the deceased. At one time the boats were floated off into the ocean, but in recent years the boats are retrieved before they go out that far so as to prevent polluting the ocean.\n\nIn 2010, it was reported that more than 180,000 people had attended the event.\n\nThe boats are called . The boats are said to carry the souls of the deceased on them. The boats are mainly built by people who have lost a family member in the last year, though they are also built by others.\n\nThe boats can be built from a quantity of different supplies and no particular one is preferred. Bamboo and grass are often used, though cogongrass is popular in Saikai, Nagasaki, and some other people use hardened corrugated cardboard. People who are mourning decorate the boat with the family crest, put a portrait of the deceased and the mortuary tablet on the boat, and also sometimes use a token that exemplifies the person (e.g. a shogi player may have a shogi piece on the boat). Those who are not mourning generally build small laced rafts, and set O-Bon lanterns, fruit or non-natural flowers on them instead. Boats made by individuals or family members are generally between 1 and 2 meters. Often boats also have a sail with sutras for Buddha and Kannon.\n\nLarger boats, called \"moyaibune\", are created and sent out by neighborhoods, local councils or organizations. Prior to the 1950s, these sorts of boats were more popular, as individual family boats are expensive and considered relatively luxurious. Neighborhood boats are usually adorned with the town icon, and paper lanterns with family crests are hung off the boat.\n\nIn more recent years, less traditional boats have gained popularity. These boats are discussed to as and are becoming progressively popular. An example of such a boat would be a yacht-shaped boat for someone who was an avid sailor.\n\nThere are various theories as to the festival's origin, though it is believed to be strongly influenced by a similar Chinese festival. The meaning of the firecrackers that are fired on the side of the road leading up to the launching place comes from a Chinese idea on how to ward off evil spirits, and by passing the boats by, they are cleansed.\n\nMasashi Sada, a native of Nagasaki, wrote a song called \"Shoro nagashi\" that is essentially about the festival. It was recorded along with Masami Yoshida under the band name \"Grape\" and was released in 1974. At the end of 2009 Sada's father died, and in 2010 he and his family sailed a boat in honor of his father. Footage was broadcast around the country.\n\n\n"}

The \"Teatro di Piazza del Duomo\", also known as the \"Teatro della Rosa\", built around 1667 was modernized in 1749 and re-opened in 1749 as the \"Nuovo Teatro di Spoleto\". After an 1817 restoration and after Rossini had visited the theatre, it gradually fell into disuse and a new theatre was needed by the mid-19th century. The 800-seat \"Teatro Nuovo\" was built between 1854 and 1864 at considerable public expense.\n\nHowever, and in spite of the \"Nuovo\", the old theatre was preserved and renovated once more with a new design and layout. Now renamed the \"Teatro Caio Melisso\" after a Spoletan writer, it re-opened in 1880 as a 350-seat, 3 levels of boxes plus a gallery opera house.\n\nThe fact that two opera theatres existed brought Gian-Carlo Menotti, the Festival's founder and director, to the town since Menotti felt that Spoleto offered many attractions. The first festival was held in 1958. The Festival's inaugural presentation on 5 June 1958 was Verdi's \"Macbeth\", but other less known and neglected operas characterized early Festivals. In addition to Menotti's own operas, most seasons reflect a broad range of periods and styles.\n\n\n"}

Lorenzini gave the hall the classic shape of a horseshoe and facing with the problem of limited space, having to reserve a box for each client family, he decided to set up the entire structure diagonally and to reduce the entrance hall. \n\nThe works began in June 1778, and ended in April 1780. The inauguration was held on August 15, 1781, and the theater could seat 1,200 people at the time.\n\nIn 1874 it was restructured and modified by Guglielmo Calderini, who gave the theater its current structure; simultaneously it was redecorated by artists like Francesco Moretti and Mariano Piervittori, who worked on the curtain of the ceiling.

Nance described the festival as it existed around the start of the 20th century. Within this work Nance also speculated that the name Bawcock was derived from Beau Coq (French) - he believed the cock was a herald of new light in Pagan times and the origins of the festival were pre-Christian. The most likely derivation of the name 'Bawcock' is from Middle English use (influenced by French) where a Bawcock is a nickname for a fine or worthy fellow. An example of such use can be found in Shakespeare's \"Twelfth Night\" Act 3. Scene 4: \"Why, how now, my bawcock!\" As the name Tom was often used as a generic description for any man it is likely that Tom Bawcock was a symbolic name for 'any fine fellow' who risked his life in pursuit of fishing. Midwinter celebrations were also common in one of Cornwall's other principal traditional occupations mining. Picrous Day and Chewidden Thursday seem to have similar origins to Tom Bawcock's Eve.\nThe only similar tradition in the British Isles that can be traced is St Rumbolds night at Folkestone in Kent. This celebration also took place near Christmas time where eight Whitings were offered in a feast to celebrate St Rumbold In Italy a Christmas Eve feast including fishes is called 'Il Cenone' or 'Big Dinner' or sometimes 'Cena della Vigilia' (the dinner of the vigil). Today the observance the feast of the Vigil is rarely practised in Italy but it survives in Italian American households, where it is better known as the Feast of the Seven Fishes.\n\nThe children's book \"The Mousehole Cat\" by Antonia Barber was inspired by the traditions and practice of Tom Bawcock's Eve and resulted in a television production of the same name. (Ms Barber lists Star-Gazy Pie as a staple of Mousehole diet \"before\" Tom's heroic fishing expedition, however, whereas according to tradition it dates from his return and legendary catch.)\n\nThere is an ongoing folk music tradition associated with Tom Bawcock's Eve. The words were written by Robert Morton Nance in 1927, to a traditional local tune called the 'Wedding March'. It is believed that Nance first observed the festivities around the start of the 20th century. His version runs as follows:\n\nThe dialect used in the words of the song translate as follows:-\nThe song appears on four of the albums by Cornish singer Brenda Wootton: \"Piper's Folk\" (1968), \"Starry Gazey Pie\" (1975), \"Way Down to Lamorna\" (1984) and \"Voice of Cornwall\" (1996).\n\n\n"}

It takes place at the Enyokeni Royal Palace in Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, and is presided over by the Zulu King, who conducts a tasting ceremony as sacred king, closed by the dashing of a calabash to signify that the people may now enjoy the fruits of the harvest; this role was historically expanded by Shaka to have more military significance with a muster and parade. It was revived by the current king Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu in 1990, after a ban by British colonial authorities following the 1879 Battle of Isandlwana and Zulu defeat in the Anglo-Zulu War (the last was held in winter 1877–78, though some claim continuity as a less elaborate event).\n\nThe festival has mass participation by young men, as Umkhosi woMhlanga has by young women. There is a black bull sacrifice in the king's kraal as the young men work together to kill the animal without weapons, which was the subject of a failed lawsuit by South African animal rights activists in 2009. The sacrifice of the bull is seen as transferring the bull's power to the king. The iNkatha was also renewed. The Scottish mythographer James George Frazer speculated that this reflected an ancient practice of sacrificing the king himself.\n\nThe Kingdom of Swaziland's counterpart event is Incwala, part of a larger family of Nguni First Fruit traditions. Aspects of the festival have been adapted by the Zulu-initiated Nazareth Baptist Church in its celebration of Christmas.

The cantonal system was selected to prevent dominance by one ethnic group over another.\n\nThe subsequently signed Washington Framework Agreement had the creation of a loose federation (or confederation) between Croatia and Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as one of its goals.\n\n\n"}

It was the first large youth gathering promoted by the Catholic Church. From that experience came the idea of the World Youth Days which since then have been held, every two or three years, in different countries of the world.\n\nThe meeting with the Pope took place in Rome on Saturday, April 14, 1984 before Palm Sunday. The young people found themselves in the morning in the square in front of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran for mass, then a long procession went to St. Peter's Square in the Vatican where the meeting took place with the Pope who, for the occasion, was accompanied on stage created on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica by Mother Teresa of Calcutta.\n\nAbout 300,000 people attended the meeting, mostly Italians, but with a significant presence of young people coming from abroad.\nPope John Paul II concluded the Youth Jubilee during the angelus of Palm Sunday. The next day, the Pope concluded the Jubilee of the Youth with the angelus on Palm Sunday.\n\nThe following week, on Easter Sunday, April 22, 1984, the Pope gave the youth the Cross of the World Youth Day as a symbol of \"the love of the Lord Jesus for humanity and as an announcement that only in Christ died and resurrected it is salvation and redemption.\" On this occasion he renewed the appointment for a meeting with the young people for Palm Sunday next, March 31, 1985, in the year that the UN proclaimed International Year of Youth.\n\n"}
