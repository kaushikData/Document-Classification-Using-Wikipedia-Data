The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on October 9, 2009, citing Obama's promotion of nuclear nonproliferation and a \"new climate\" in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world.\n\nThe Nobel Committee's decision drew mixed reactions from US commentators and editorial writers across the political spectrum, as well as from the rest of the world.\n\nObama accepted the prize in Oslo on December 10, 2009. In a 36-minute speech, he discussed the tensions between war and peace and the idea of a \"just war\" saying, \"perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars.\"\n\nObama is the fourth President of the United States to have won the Nobel Peace Prize (after Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter, with Carter's honor happening after leaving office).\n\nThe winner is selected by the Nobel Committee from nominations submitted by committee members and others. Nominations for the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize closed just 11 days after Obama took office. There were 205 nominations for the 2009 award, which included Chinese and Afghan civil rights activists and African politicians. Colombian Senator Piedad Córdoba, Afghanistan's Sima Samar, Chinese dissident Hu Jia and Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Morgan Tsvangirai had been speculated to be favorites for the award.\n\nThe five members of the Nobel Committee are appointed by the Norwegian Parliament to roughly reflect the party makeup of that body. The 2009 Committee comprised two members of the Norwegian Labor Party, one from the left-wing Socialist Left Party, one from the Conservative Party of Norway and one from the right-wing Progress Party. The chairman of the Committee was Thorbjørn Jagland, former Norwegian Labor Party prime minister and Secretary General of the Council of Europe since September 29, 2009. The panel met six or seven times in 2009, beginning several weeks after the February 1 nomination deadline. The winner was chosen unanimously on October 5. but was initially opposed by the Socialist Left, Conservative and Progress Party members until strongly persuaded by Jagland.\n\nJagland said \"We have not given the prize for what may happen in the future. We are awarding Obama for what he has done in the past year. And we are hoping this may contribute a little bit for what he is trying to do,\" noting that he hoped the award would assist Obama's foreign policy efforts. Jagland said the committee was influenced by a speech Obama gave about Islam in Cairo in June 2009, the president's efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation and climate change, and Obama's support for using established international bodies such as the United Nations to pursue foreign policy goals. \"The New York Times\" reported that Jagland shrugged off the question of whether \"the committee feared being labeled naïve for accepting a young politician's promises at face value\", stating that \"no one could deny that 'the international climate' had suddenly improved, and that Mr. Obama was the main reason...'We want to embrace the message that he stands for.\"\nObama was the fourth U.S. President to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, after Theodore Roosevelt (1906) and Woodrow Wilson (1919)—both of whom received the award during their terms—and Jimmy Carter (2002), who received the award 21 years after leaving office. In addition, then-sitting Vice President Charles Dawes was a co-winner with Austen Chamberlain (1925), and former Vice President Al Gore was a co-winner with the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2007)\n\nObama was the first U.S. president to receive the award during his first year in office (at eight and a half months, after being nominated less than two weeks in office), although several other world leaders were awarded in the year following their election to national office, including Óscar Arias (1987) and Aung San Suu Kyi (1991).\n\nObama said he was \"surprised\" and \"deeply humbled\" by the award. In remarks given at the White House Rose Garden on the day of the announcement, Obama stated, \"I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments but rather an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations.\"\n\n\"Throughout history, the Nobel Peace Prize has not just been used to honor specific achievement; it's also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes,\" Obama said. \"And that is why I will accept this award as a call to action — a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st century.\" He said those common challenges included the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons (which he said might not occur in his lifetime), nuclear proliferation, climate change, tolerance \"among people of different faiths and races and religions\", peace between and security for Israelis and Palestinians, better social conditions for the world's poor, including \"the ability to get an education and make a decent living; the security that you won't have to live in fear of disease or violence without hope for the future.\" The United States, he said, is \"a country that's responsible for ending a war and working in another theater to confront a ruthless adversary that directly threatens the American people and our allies.\"\n\nThe award, he said, \"must be shared with everyone who strives for justice and dignity — for the young woman who marches silently in the streets on behalf of her right to be heard even in the face of beatings and bullets; for the leader imprisoned in her own home because she refuses to abandon her commitment to democracy [referring to Aung San Suu Kyi]; for the soldier who sacrificed through tour after tour of duty on behalf of someone half a world away; and for all those men and women across the world who sacrifice their safety and their freedom and sometime their lives for the cause of peace.\" He did not take questions from reporters after giving his statement.\n\nObama announced early that he would donate the full 10 million Swedish kronor (about US$1.4 million) monetary award to charity. The largest donations were given to the housing charity Fisher House Foundation who received $250,000, and the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund which received $200,000. Eight organizations which support education also received a donation. $125,000 was donated to the College Summit, the Posse Foundation, the United Negro College Fund, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund, the Appalachian Leadership and Education Foundation, and the American Indian College Fund. $100,000 was donated to Africare, and the Central Asia Institute.\n\nObama's winning of the peace prize was largely unanticipated and called a \"stunning surprise\" by \"The New York Times\", though major oddsmaker Centrebet had in fact put him at 7–1 odds of winning, with Piedad Córdoba and Sima Samar at 6–1 and Morgan Tsvangirai at 7–1.\n\nIn a \"USA Today\" / Gallup Poll conducted October 16–19, 61% of American adults polled responded that they thought Obama did not deserve to win the prize, while 34% responded that he did; when asked if they were personally glad that Obama won the award, 46% of respondents said they were and 47% said they were not glad (poll margin of error +/-3%).\n\nThere was widespread criticism of the Nobel Committee's decision from commentators and editorial writers across the political spectrum. \"The New York Times\" published a mildly-supportive editorial which said the prize was \"a (barely) implicit condemnation of Mr. Bush's presidency. But countering the ill will Mr. Bush created around the world is one of Mr. Obama's great achievements in less than nine months in office. Mr. Obama's willingness to respect and work with other nations is another.\" It said that much remains to be done. Among those agreeing that the award was a criticism of the Bush administration were the editorial pages of the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Wall Street Journal\", and \"Washington Post\", as well as Thomas L. Friedman of the \"New York Times\". \"Today\" host Matt Lauer and Jonah Goldberg of the \"National Review\" said that less than a year into the first term, there have been \"no major foreign policy achievements to date.\" Goldberg added: \"surely someone in Iran—or maybe the Iranian protestors generally—could have benefitted more from receiving the prize\" while in \"CounterPunch\", political journalist Alexander Cockburn said that, in historical context of other former U.S. Presidents winning the Nobel Peace Prize, the award to Obama \"represents a radical break in tradition, since he's only had slightly less than nine months to discharge his imperial duties.\" Peter Beinart of the Daily Beast called the decision a \"farce\", while Noam Chomsky said : \"In defense of the committee, we might say that the achievement of doing nothing to advance peace places Obama on a considerably higher moral plane than some of the earlier recipients\".\n\nMany were critical of the Nobel Committee. A \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial, noting Obama's comment that the world's problems \"can't be met by any one leader or any one nation\", opined, \"What this suggests to us—and to the Norwegians—is the end of what has been called 'American exceptionalism'. This is the view that U.S. values have universal application and should be promoted without apology, and defended with military force when necessary. Put in this context, we wonder if most Americans will count this peace-of-the-future prize as a compliment.\" \"Washington Post\" columnist Michael Gerson wrote that the committee members \"have forfeited any claim to seriousness. Peace—the kind of peace that keeps people from being killed and oppressed—is an achievement, not a sentiment. [...] Intending to honor Obama, the committee has actually embarrassed him.\" \"Commentary\" magazine's Peter Wehner wrote that the award, with past awards that seemed aimed at criticizing the Bush administration, showed the Nobel Committee \"long ago ceased to be a serious entity; this choice merely confirms that judgment.\"\n\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\" news analyst Dan Balz, \"[E]ven among his supporters there was a sense of surprise and even shock on Friday [the day of the announcement], a belief that the award was premature, a disservice and a potential liability.\" An editorial in \"The Washington Post\" began, \"It's an odd Nobel Peace Prize that almost makes you embarrassed for the honoree\", and compared the Nobel Committee's statement that Obama had \"created a new climate in international politics\" to a recent satirical skit on television. A \"Los Angeles Times\" editorial said the committee \"didn't just embarrass Obama, it diminished the credibility of the prize itself\". Thomas L. Friedman of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"It dismays me that the most important prize in the world has been devalued in this way\". Much of the commentary across the political spectrum involved describing the award as something risible, with the humor focusing on Obama's getting the award without having accomplished much. According to an analysis in \"The New York Times\", \"it [...] [is] striking how so many people seemed to greet the Nobel news with shock followed by laughter,\" On the morning of the announcement, several of \"The Washington Post\" opinion-page columnists, posting at the newspaper's \"Post Partisan\" blog, characterized the award as laughable or directly satirized it, including such supportive columnists as Ruth Marcus (\"ridiculous—embarrassing, even\"), Richard Cohen (who satirized the award), and foreign-affairs columnist David Ignatius (\"goofy\" and \"weird\"), and Michael Kinsley (whose satirical response came the next day). Other prominent commentators who often supported Obama but responded with ridicule included Peter Beinart and Ann Althouse.\n\nJames Taranto wrote in \"The Wall Street Journal\" an article summarising various opinions on the Internet, concluding how the award was embarrassing for Obama. He said the award was a \"staggeringly premature honor--the equivalent of a lifetime-achievement Oscar for a child star--makes yesterday's satire into today's news\". Fred Greenstein, presidential historian and author and professor of politics emeritus at Princeton University, told FOX News that giving President Obama the Nobel Peace Prize is a \"premature canonization\" and an \"embarrassment to the Nobel process.\" \"Slate magazine\" blogger Mickey Kaus, \"New York Times\" columnist David Brooks and former U.N. ambassador John Bolton amongst others, called for Obama to not accept the award; pundit Michael Crowley argued that it was a \"mixed blessing\".\n\nSubsequent to the award many Americans now consider that Obama did not deserve it in the light of following events. \nOpponents of the award cite the expansion of the War on Terror and the large increase in the number of drone strikes carried out under Obama, specifically in Pakistan. There have been a number of calls for Obama to either return the award or to have the Nobel Committee recall it, most recently in 2013. In April 2013 a petition was begun asking the Nobel Committee to rescind the Peace Prize. The petition garnered 10,000 signatures in its first day and nearly 20,000 by the end of its first week.\n\nNobel laureate and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore called the award \"extremely well deserved\". Obama received congratulations and kind words from other elected officials, such as from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former rival, Senator John McCain, who said, \"As Americans, we're proud when our president receives an award of that prestigious category\". RNC chairman Michael Steele discussed his disapproval of the award in a fund-raising letter, writing, \"the Democrats and their international leftist allies want America made subservient to the agenda of global redistribution and control.\"\n\nIn 2015, Geir Lundestad, the non-voting Director of the Nobel Institute and secretary for the Nobel Committee at the time of the award, published a memoir, \"Secretary of Peace\". In it, he wrote \"In hindsight, we could say that the argument of giving Obama a helping hand was only partially correct. Many of Obama's supporters believed it was a mistake.\" Lundestad said that Obama had been surprised by the award, and considered not going to Oslo to accept it. He also said in his memoir that Obama had since failed to live up to the Nobel Committee's expectations.\n\nA poll conducted by Synovate for the newspaper \"Dagbladet\" showed that 43% of the Norwegian population believed giving Obama the prize was right, while 38% believed it was wrong. 19% had no opinion. The poll showed a sharp divide between younger and older people; of those over 60 years of age 58% were for and only 31% against it. Of those between 18 and 29 years of age, only 25% approved of the decision, while 42% disapproved.\n\nThe award divided opinion among politicians. Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg congratulated Obama for a \"well-deserved prize\". Siv Jensen, leader of the opposition Progress Party, said that while Obama had taken several good initiatives the committee should have waited to see their results. Erna Solberg, leader of the Conservative Party, also said that the prize came early and increased pressure on Obama to live up to the expectation. Torstein Dahle, the leader of the far leftist party Red, called the award a scandal, citing the fact that Obama was the commander-in-chief of a country at war in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nThe response from U.S. allies was generally positive; reactions around the world were mixed:\n\nSeveral Nobel Laureates have commented: Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus, (co-winner 2006 prize), said the committee's award was \"an endorsement of [Obama] and the direction he is taking.\" Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the award to Obama \"anticipates an even greater contribution towards making our world a safer place for all.\" Mairead Corrigan, (co-winner 1976), expressed her disappointment, stating, \"[g]iving this award to the leader of the most militarized country in the world, which has taken the human family against its will to war, will be rightly seen by many people around the world as a reward for his country's aggression and domination.\" Lech Wałęsa, (1983) cofounder of the Solidarity trade union, and former president of Poland said the award was premature. \"He has not yet made a real input.\" The 14th Dalai Lama congratulated Obama.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised the Nobel Committee's choice. \"We are entering an era of renewed multilateralism [...] President Obama embodies the new spirit of dialogue and engagement on the world's biggest problems: climate change, nuclear disarmament and a wide range of peace and security challenges.\"\n\nIn Europe, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the award would reinforce Obama's determination to work for justice and peace. He added that the award \"finally confirms the return of America in the hearts of all the peoples of the world\". Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev said the award will encourage warmer U.S.–Russian relations, and he hoped it would \"serve as an additional incentive\" for both governments to foster a better \"climate in world politics\". British Prime Minister Gordon Brown sent a private message of congratulations to President Obama. Hope that the prize would assist Obama's efforts toward nuclear disarmament was also a part of congratulatory statements from Ireland's Taoiseach Brian Cowen and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Vatican spokesman Fr. Federico Lombardi said the Vatican \"appreciated\" the nomination. Kosovar President Fatmir Sejdiu congratulated Obama by saying, \"This award is testimony to your success as a leader of a free country aimed at creating a safer and more peaceful world.\"\n\nIn Australia, former Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said that the selection was \"a political decision of gross stupidity\", laying the blame on the selection committee for a \"hideous display of cynical politics\". Stuart Rees, director of the Sydney Peace Foundation in Australia, questioned the award. \"Perhaps the Nobel organisation wants to give him a magic wand. I think the guy is full of promise, but I don't think the promise has been realised yet particularly in regards the Middle East.\"\n\nIn Asia and the Middle East: Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai said that Obama was the \"appropriate\" person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. \"His hard work and his new vision on global relations, his will and efforts for creating friendly and good relations at global level and global peace make him the appropriate recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize,\" said Siamak Hirai, a spokesman for Karzai. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the decision was ridiculous, saying, \"The Nobel prize for peace? Obama should have won the 'Nobel Prize for escalating violence and killing civilians.\"\nIndonesia's, Masdar Mas'udi, deputy head of the Islamic organisation Nahdlatul Ulama, praised Obama's policy towards his country as confirmation of his worthiness as a Nobel laureate. \"I think it's appropriate because he is the only American president who has reached out to us in peace,\" he said. \"On the issues of race, religion, skin colour, he has an open attitude.\"\nJapanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama,\nIndian President Pratibha Patil and Israeli President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shimon Peres sent congratulatory messages to Obama, but Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told reporters that \"the decision was taken hastily and the award was [too] early.\"\n\nIn Latin America, former Cuban President Fidel Castro called the award \"positive\" and said the prize should be seen as a criticism to the \"genocidal policy\" carried out by past U.S. presidents. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolás Maduro said the award was a surprise and perhaps premature. \"As President Hugo Chávez said at the United Nations, (the Obama administration) is a government that has raised expectations and hopes in many people in the world, amid great contradictions.\"\n\nIn Africa, the news of the Obama Nobel Peace Prize was positively received. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki issued a statement saying that the prize was a \"recognition of the contribution [Obama is] making for the well being of humanity.\" In South Africa, President Jacob Zuma used \"Ubuntu\"—the Zulu term for \"the importance of community\"—in his congratulatory message, saying that the U.S. president's \"leadership reflects the true spirit of Ubuntu because your approach celebrates our common humanity.\" Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, who was touted as a possible Nobel laureate, said Obama deserved the honor.\n\nIn 2011 Bolivian President Evo Morales and Russian Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky condemned the award calling it hypocritical in light of US policy during the Libyan Civil War.\n\nAfter the death of Anwar al-Awlaki and his son Abdulrahman al-Awlaki by CIA predator drones in Yemen, Nasser al-Awlaki, the father and grandfather of Anwar and Abdulrahman respectively, released an audio message condemning the killings:\n\nPresident Obama accepted the Nobel Peace prize in person at the Oslo City Hall in Norway on December 10, 2009. In a 36-minute speech, reportedly written by Obama and then edited by Jon Favreau and Ben Rhodes, he discussed the tensions between war and peace and the idea of a \"just war\". The address contained elements of the ideas of Reinhold Niebuhr, someone Obama once described as one of his favorite philosophers.\n\nThe speech was generally well received by American pundits on both ends of the political spectrum. Several noted similarities between Obama's message and the rhetoric of President George W. Bush. This was also mentioned by former Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson, who called it a \"very American speech\" and wrote that \"Obama was recognizing that the great commitments and themes of American foreign policy are durably bipartisan\". A number of prominent Republican politicians publicly praised the speech, including Newt Gingrich and Sarah Palin. Conservative \"New York Times\" columnist Ross Douthat called it an oftentimes impressive speech that was \"An extended defense of using realist means in the service of liberal internationalist ends\". Columnist Andrew Sullivan distinguished between the Obama and Bush messages, stating that \"Obama is \"far more conservative\" than his predecessor\" in his views on human imperfection, reality, and war; he also linked the speech back to the tragic nature of Obama's line \"the audacity of hope\".\n\nFormer Jimmy Carter speechwriter Hendrik Hertzberg said that the speech \"will live on for a long time as a text for peacemakers in power\". A few commentators were more critical, with former US Ambassador to the UN John Bolton calling it \"pedestrian, turgid, and uninspired\" and US Congressman Dennis Kucinich \"Once we are committed to war's instrumentality in pursuit of peace, we begin the Orwellian journey to the semantic netherworld where war is peace...\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" praised the eloquence of the speech, noting that \"President Obama gave the speech he needed to give, but we suspect not precisely the one the Nobel committee wanted to hear.\" \"The Wall Street Journal\" echoed this sentiment and congratulated Obama for defending the occasional necessity of war and for stating that evil exists in the world, though used the same editorial to criticize him for current disarmament talks with Russia and a lack of progress with Iran and North Korea. The \"Los Angeles Times\" lauded the speech as \"a blockbuster even by Obama's lofty standards\", and even though the ideas were not new, \"Obama's special gift is to make them seem achievable by appealing to our higher nature.\" It was also received well by columnists in \"The Washington Post\".\n\nAbroad, British historian Simon Schama said of the speech that \"in its seriousness, bravery and clarity, [it] was on a par with FDR and Churchill\" and \"summoned the spirit of Cicero\".\n\n\n"}

It is attended by automotive industry representatives, dealers, auto journalists and car enthusiasts. Most auto shows occur once or twice a year. They are important to car manufacturers and local dealers as a public relations exercise, as they advertise new products and promote auto brands. The five most prestigious auto shows, sometimes called the \"Big Five\", are generally considered to be held in Frankfurt, Geneva, Detroit, Paris and Tokyo.\n\nThere are other auto/car shows that occur on a more frequent basis, almost weekly. It is not known if there is a regularly accepted term for these more frequent, informal \"car rallies\" or \"car enthusiasts events\". Some meeting events have themes, such as classic cars, hot rods, etc. These events are more localized, typically consisting of car enthusiasts who meet to socialize and enjoy their enthusiasm with other car owners.\n\nThe Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles organizes many auto shows.\n\nThey are distinguishable from car shows in that auto shows typically showcase new or concept vehicles whereas car shows showcase custom, classic, or exotic cars. They also distinguish in that auto shows are almost always a major professional event whereas car shows can be either professional or amateur and many are locally organized. Auto shows always charge for admission whereas many cities have local, free car shows.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4820101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4820101", "title": "Cabinessence", "text": "Cabinessence\n\n\"Cabinessence\" (originally written as \"Cabin Essence\") is a song written by Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks for the American rock band the Beach Boys in 1966. Intended for the discarded album \"Smile\", it was not released until three years later for the album \"20/20\".\n\nThe subject of the song is said by Wilson to be \"about railroads,\" as he intended to encapsulate the image of Chinese laborers pounding rail spikes while their minds go \"off on a different track\" after noticing a crow flying overhead. According to journalist Nick Kent, the song \"juxtaposed both highly-advanced Western and Eastern musical references\" with an \"oriental presence\", making use of the banjo and harmonica as well as percussion in the chorus designed to emulate the sound of workers assembling train tracks.\n\n\"Cabinessence\" has received much acclaim over the years as the stand-out track on \"20/20\". Biographer Jon Stebbins observed the song's \"demonic chanting\" which he believed exemplified \"some of the most haunting, manic, evil-sounding music the Beach Boys ever made\". \"MOJO\" described Cabinessence as \"\"Smile\" in microcosm. Vast in scope, unprecedented in its ambition and as much an unsolved sonic riddle as the album it had been written for, this was the misunderstood masterpiece that caused Mike Love to crack and the project to flounder.\"\n\nBrian Wilson stated that he and Van Dyke Parks wrote the song along with \"Heroes and Villains\" \"Wonderful\" and \"Surf's Up\" in a giant sandbox with a piano in it that Wilson had built in his living room.. \"Cabinessence\" was one of a number of \"Smile\" tracks which contained lyrics that the other band members did not approve of, being infamously oblique and replete with wordplay. The seemingly-surreal couplet of the closing \"Grand Coulee Dam\" section are as follows,\n\nIf the listener rearranges the last half of each line, they get \"over and over the crow cries and hovers the wheatfield / over and over the thresher uncovers the cornfield\", which makes them clearer. Parks penned additional lyrics to Cabinessence not heard on any official release, nor bootlegged. They are unknown to have ever been recorded during tracking sessions. Clarifying the song's historical references, Parks says:\n\nThe song has three distinct sections: \"Home on the Range\", \"Who Ran the Iron Horse\", and \"The Grand Coulee Dam\" in the form of ABABC. \"Home on the Range\" may be seen as the verse, and \"Who Ran the Iron Horse\" as the chorus. While \"Home on the Range\" is in 4/4, or \"common time\", \"Who Ran the Iron Horse\" is a waltz. \"The Grand Coulee Dam\" is in 3/4 time as well. The chorus features the repeated line, \"\"Who ran the Iron Horse?\" over \"aah\"\" harmonies in mixolydian mode, and patterned to an I7—V7 progression in the implied key of F major. In the second iteration of this section, there are barely-audible lyrics sung by Dennis Wilson underneath the harmonies. In 1969, Brian Wilson wrote:\nMusician Mark Johnson refers to the banjo in \"Cabinessence\" as \"traditionally the Great American folk instrument,\" with it being used \"like part of the soundtrack to a lost \"Twilight Zone\" episode,\" and that the song \"could be an exploration a la John Steinbeck of what American music's function really is. To simply fill a room, while we go about our days and nights.\" The track was largely mixed and completed in December 1966, lacking only a lead vocal and a coherent structure. An alternate work-in-progress version was described by friend and \"Smile\" participant Michael Vosse in 1969.\n\nDennis Wilson sings a heavily syncopated vocal rap during the song's second chorus. He says, \"I got off so much on doing that. It's mixed way down in the track, and it’s syncopated all the way through. Right there is my biggest turn-on.\" The lines are: \"Truck-driving man, do what you can. / High-tail your load off the road, out of night-life. / It's a gas, man. I don’t believe I gotta grieve. / In and out of luck with a buck and a booth. / Catching on to the truth, in the vast past, the last gasp. / In the land, in the dust, trust that you must catch as catch can.\"\n\nA recording session for \"The Grand Coulee Dam\" vocal overdubs on December 6, 1966 reportedly saw tensions within the band boil over when Love was instructed by Wilson to sing the song's lyrics. Bemused, Love demanded that Wilson call lyricist Parks to the recording session to explain the meaning of the coda line \"Over and over, the crow cries, uncover the cornfield. Over and over, the thresher and hovers, the wheatfield\". Wilson complied, and asked Parks if he was willing to come down to the studio to sort out Love's complaints. Upon arriving at the studio, Love questioned the lyrics reportedly in an aggressive fashion. Unable to come up with an answer that satisfied Love and unwilling to be drawn into an argument about the quality of his work, Parks responded by simply stating he didn't know the meaning of the lyric. Consequently, Parks left the session feeling as though he was intruding on a family feud with roots and motivations that had nothing to do with him, and would eventually leave the project in the spring of 1967. Some consider this to have doomed the album. Defending himself in later years, Love has rebutted:\n\nDuring the 1990s, Love reportedly asked Parks about the lyrics again. According to Parks, \"I was able to tell him, once again, 'I don’t know.' I have no idea what those words mean. I was perhaps thinking of Van Gogh's wheat field or an idealized agrarian environment. Maybe I meant nothing, but I was trying to follow Brian Wilson's vision at that time.\"\n\nIn April 1969, Vosse stated: \"The recording of it on \"20/20\" is new, because before his ear operation about a year ago, Brian could not hear in stereo.\" Although the final \"Smile\" version would have most likely been released in monoaural sound, the track was eventually released in stereo as \"Cabinessence\" on their 1969 album \"20/20\", with a lead vocal overdub by Carl Wilson recorded on November 20, 1968. It was met with interest and praise upon its release in 1969 following \"Our Prayer\" due to its roots in the much publicized \"Smile\" project three years earlier.\n\nAn instrumental version can be found on the Beach Boys' 1993 \"\" box set.

{"id": "55387617", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55387617", "title": "Child Friendly Spaces", "text": "Child Friendly Spaces\n\nChild Friendly Spaces (CFS) are safe spaces set up in emergency settings to help support and protect children. Their objective is to restore a sense of normality and continuity to children whose lives have been disrupted by war, natural disaster, or other emergencies. They provide children with opportunities to develop, play, learn, and strengthen resiliency either after a crisis or during a protracted emergency in a safe, child friendly, and stimulating environment. NGOs or governments design and operate CFS in a participatory manner, often relying on community support. They are a short- to medium-term program response and often operate in tents or temporary structures. CFS are one of the most widely used child protection and psychosocial support interventions in emergencies. One reason for their popularity is that they offer potential for adaptability of activities to diverse contexts, rapid deployment, and low relative costs. Different agencies refer to CFS by different names including Child Centered Spaces (CCS), Safe Spaces, Safe Play Areas, and Child Friendly Spaces/Environments (CFS/E).\n\nCFS give children an opportunity to escape the crowded living conditions they may be subject to during crises. As they are supervised, they also provide parents child-free time that can be necessary for fetching water, earning a living, or other activities. Given that stress levels and incidents of abuse rise during emergencies, providing children with this space and parents with time can mitigate risks. CFC can be adapted to support young children or adolescents, who are often neglected in emergencies.\n\nCFS have been used widely since 1999. They began as a rights-based approach developed by UNICEF to guarantee children’s rights to survival, development, participation and protection, especially at times of crisis or instability. UNICEF launched the first CFC during the Kosovo crisis in Albania in April 1999. Subsequently, CFS were used in the camps for the survivors of a 1999 earthquake in Turkey. They then became a common part of the humanitarian response and have since been used in Angola, Chad, Colombia, Denmark, East Timor, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Finland, Germany, Greece, India, Iran, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Liberia, Mali, Russia, Occupied Palestinian Territories, Pakistan, Paraguay, Philippines, Serbia, Somalia, Spain, Syria, Tanzania, Turkey, and Uganda, among other countries.\n\nCFC are integrated programs that provide children with access to a range of services or activities that may vary by context. These include structured recreational opportunities, play groups, peer support services, and remedial classes. Some programs involve religious and spiritual activities.\n\nWorld Vision and Columbia University, along with Save the Children, UNICEF and others, engaged in a three-year collaborative project to document the outcomes and impacts of CFS. They found that CFS can benefit children, but the extent of their impact varies widely. In many contexts, CFS provide a foundation for positive impact on children’s lives, but their impact is small. They also found that younger children tended to attend the CFS more and show greater impact. There have not been longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term effects of CFS interventions on children.\n"}

The term Chingay itself originated from the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia, which is a phonetic equivalent of both the Chinese words \"真艺\" (\"zhēnyì\") which means \"true art\" in the Penang version, and \"妆艺,\" (\"zhuāngyì\") which means \"a decorated miniature stage\" or float in the Singapore version. PAYM (People's Association Youth Movement) has been an active contributor to chingay in Singapore. Today the parade is celebrated by the Chinese, Malay and Indian communities of both Malaysia and Singapore.\n\nChingay procession was held in celebration with the birthdays of the Chinese deities or the procession of the Goddess of Mercy (Guanyin). It was held to worship and enjoy with the deity. During the earliest procession in more than 100 years ago, the earliest English newspapers Echo in Malaysia adopted the word Chingay Procession for this special event.\n\nChingay originated from China, and the Penang Chinese first performed Chingay during deity processions. It is a street art where the performer balances a giant flag that ranges from in height and about in weight.\n\nToday, in Malaysia and Singapore, Chingay is not only performed by the Chinese, but the art has successfully attracted the Malays and Indians. It has become a unique multiracial performance. The popularity of Chingay in Penang has made it one of the very impressive cultural landmarks as well as an important tourist attraction.\n\nThe Chingay Parade traces its origins to a float decorating competition held in Penang in 1905. This practice of float decoration spread to the rest of Malaya by the 1960s, and eventually became associated with the Chinese New Year.\n\nThe second Chingay procession was held in 1926 in celebration of the birthday of the God of Prosperity. The third Chingay procession was held in 1957 to celebrate the centenary of the City Council of George Town.\n\nIn the pursuit of ensuring the perpetual existence of Chingay, Chinese community in Malaysia worked hand in hand to call for the enthusiasts of various areas in forming the liaison committee of Penang Chingay in 1960s.\n\nA Chingay parade is now held annually within the city of George Town every December. The yearly event, which has attracted locals and tourists alike, starts in the evening from Brick Kiln Road (now Gurdwara Road), snaking through the city streets before ending at the Esplanade.\n\nThe Chingay parade in Johor are held annually by the Johor Bahru Old Chinese Temple. It is joined by the five main clans in the state, which are Cantonese, Hainanese, Hakka, Hoklo and Teochew.\n\nOn 4 February 1973, the first Singapore Chingay parade was held partly as a result of the ban on firecrackers a year earlier in 1972 as a result of fire hazards. This ban was viewed unfavourably despite the safety issues involved. Some people felt that the ban would result in a much dampened festival mood for the Chinese New Year period. To address this issue, the People's Association and the Singapore National Pugilistic Association jointly organised a street parade from Jalan Besar to Outram Park featuring the signature floats, acrobatic acts, lion and dragon dances, stilt walkers, and the like, to bring back some cheer to the general public.\n\nThe largely Chinese parade became a multi-cultural one from 1977 when Malay and Indian groups started joining in the performances, which was to mark a major precedent in the overall flavour of the parade into one which has become largely multi-cultural in character, despite the continued presence of traditional Chinese acts such as lion dances and stilt walkers to this day.\n\nIn 1985, the parade marched down Orchard Road for the first time, a move which was to prevail for much of the parade's subsequent history. Although the change could be attributed to the desire of organisers in bringing it closer to tourists along the major tourist belt and for ease of organisation on a relatively long and straight stretch of road, it also further signified the increasingly desinicized character of the parade. This is further evidenced when in 1987, an international flavour was added to the parade when a group from Japan participated for the first time with their float sponsored by The Straits Times.\n\nThe Chingay Parade became an evening-to-night parade in 1990, changing the overall feel of the parade towards one in which lights and pyrotechnics dominate. In 2000, the parade was shifted out of Orchard Road to the Civic District centering at City Hall, an area steeped in Singaporean history and culture. Construction works at the City Hall area resulted in the parade marching through the streets of the Chinatown district for the first time. Faced with limited space for spectator stands and a much more complicated and winding route in these locations, however, the parade moved back to Orchard Road in 2004 along with an effort to introduce audience participation and involvement in the traditionally passive parade. Firecrackers were let off for the first time in the parade that year. Despite the authorities allowing the firecrackers to be let off under some safety procedures, it was decided that the Chingay be preserved. In 2008, the parade was once again held at City Hall, with the route lasting from the City Hall building to The Esplanade. For the 2009 parade, it was centralised around Parliament House with the performers going around the Padang and also featured a magical Grand Finale (MAGICBOX@Chingay 2009). That year was also the first year that the telecast on television was delayed by one day. In 2010, the parade took place on part of the Formula One Marina Bay Street Circuit route.\n\nPost-parade street parties have been held since 2004, with the exception of 2007. An estimated 150,000 spectators attended the 2009 Chingay Parade on 1 February. One million Singaporeans watched the parade on television and another 16.3 million homes and hotels across Asia received the television broadcast through Channel NewsAsia.\n\nThe 2011 Chingay Parade was held on the 11 and 12 February. It opened with a Fire Party, and included the largest moving multi-ethnic performances, the first travelling dance competition within the parade, a spectacular finale where thousands of performers flooded the parade ground holding candle lights and an inaugural colourful Arts District/ Carnival. It also included activities in which the public could participate, such as the Teresa Teng Look-Alike Photo Contest and the Chingay Paparazzi competition.\n\nThe 2013 Chingay parade was held on 22 and 23 February. In 2014, Chingay was held on 7 and 8 February at the F1 Pit Building. Some 70,000 individuals ushered in The Year of the Horse.\n\nThe 2015 Chingay was planned to involve some 11,000 performers from 150 organisations, including 760 overseas performers from 15 groups, in the largest celebration yet. Themed \"We love Singapore(SG)\", the main Chingay 2015 was planned to be held at the F1 Pit Building on February 27 and 28, while a street party along Orchard Road involving youths would be held on 1 March.\n\nThe 2018 Chingay will involve 2,000 parade volunteers and 6,500 parade performers, and will also feature many examples of smart technology, including dancing robots and driverless cars. The 2018 Chingay will be the first year to have a free street parade and carnival as part of the celebration, and will follow a 1.5 kilometre route, double the length of the usual 720 metres.\n\n"}

{"id": "155056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155056", "title": "Dehydration", "text": "Dehydration\n\nIn physiology, dehydration is a deficit of total body water, with an accompanying disruption of metabolic processes. It occurs when free water loss exceeds free water intake, usually due to exercise, disease, or high environmental temperature. Mild dehydration can also be caused by immersion diuresis, which may increase risk of decompression sickness in divers.\n\nMost people can tolerate a three to four percent decrease in total body water without difficulty or adverse health effects. A five to eight percent decrease can cause fatigue and dizziness. Loss of over ten percent of total body water can cause physical and mental deterioration, accompanied by severe thirst. Death occurs at a loss of between fifteen and twenty-five percent of the body water. Mild dehydration is characterized by thirst and general discomfort and is usually resolved with oral rehydration.\n\nDehydration can cause hypernatremia (high levels of sodium ions in the blood) and is distinct from hypovolemia (loss of blood volume, particularly plasma).\n\nThe hallmarks of dehydration include thirst and neurological changes such as headaches, general discomfort, loss of appetite, decreased urine volume (unless polyuria is the cause of dehydration), confusion, unexplained tiredness, purple fingernails and seizures. The symptoms of dehydration become increasingly severe with greater total body water loss. A body water loss of 1-2%, considered mild dehydration, is shown to impair cognitive performance. In people over age 50, the body's thirst sensation diminishes and continues diminishing with age. Many senior citizens suffer symptoms of dehydration. Dehydration contributes to morbidity in the elderly especially during conditions that promote insensible free water losses such as hot weather. A Cochrane review on this subject defined water-loss dehydration as \"people with serum osmolality of 295 mOsm/kg or more\" and found that the main symptoms in the elderly were expressing fatigue, missing drinks between meals and bioelectrical impedance analysis.\n\nRisk factors for dehydration include but are not limited to: exerting oneself in hot and humid weather, habitation at high altitudes, endurance athletics, elderly adults, infants, children and people living with chronic illnesses.\n\nIn the elderly, blunted response to thirst and/or inadequate ability to access free water in the face of excess free water losses (especially hyperglycemia related) seem to be the main causes of dehydration. Excess free water or hypotonic water can leave the body in two ways - \"sensible\" loss such as osmotic diuresis, sweating, vomiting and diarrhea, and \"insensible\" water loss, occurring mainly through the skin and respiratory tract. In humans, dehydration can be caused by a wide range of diseases and states that impair water homeostasis in the body. These occur primarily through either impaired thirst/water access or sodium excess.\n\nDehydration occurs when water intake is not enough to replace free water lost due to normal physiologic processes, including breathing, urination, and perspiration, or other causes, including diarrhea and vomiting. Dehydration can be life-threatening when severe and lead to seizures or respiratory arrest, and also carries the risk of osmotic cerebral edema if rehydration is overly rapid.\n\nThe term dehydration has sometimes been used incorrectly as a proxy for the separate, related condition hypovolemia, which specifically refers to a decrease in volume of blood plasma. The two are regulated through independent mechanisms in humans; the distinction is important in guiding treatment.\n\nFor routine activities, thirst is normally an adequate guide to maintain proper hydration. Minimum water intake will vary individually depending on weight, environment, diet and genetics. With exercise, exposure to hot environments, or a decreased thirst response, additional water may be required. In athletes in competition drinking to thirst optimizes performance and safety, despite weight loss, and as of 2010, there was no scientific study showing that it is beneficial to stay ahead of thirst and maintain weight during exercise.\n\nIn warm or humid weather or during heavy exertion, water loss can increase markedly, because humans have a large and widely variable capacity for the active secretion of sweat. Whole-body sweat losses in men can exceed 2 L/h during competitive sport, with rates of 3–4 L/h observed during short-duration, high-intensity exercise in the heat. When such large amounts of water are being lost through perspiration, electrolytes, especially sodium, are also being lost.\n\nIn most athletes, exercising and sweating for 4–5 hours with a sweat sodium concentration of less than 50 mmol/L, the total sodium lost is less than 10% of total body stores (total stores are approximately 2,500 mmol, or 58 g for a 70-kg person). These losses appear to be well tolerated by most people. The inclusion of some sodium in fluid replacement drinks has some theoretical benefits and poses little or no risk, so long as these fluids are hypotonic (since the mainstay of dehydration prevention is the replacement of free water losses).\n\nThe consumption of overly sugary and/or salty foods can cause dehydration. \n\nThe treatment for minor dehydration that is often considered the most effective is drinking water and stopping fluid loss. Plain water restores only the volume of the blood plasma, inhibiting the thirst mechanism before solute levels can be replenished. Solid foods can contribute to fluid loss from vomiting and diarrhea. Urine concentration and frequency will customarily return to normal as dehydration resolves.\n\nIn some cases, correction of a dehydrated state is accomplished by the replenishment of necessary water and electrolytes (through oral rehydration therapy or fluid replacement by intravenous therapy). As oral rehydration is less painful, less invasive, less expensive, and easier to provide, it is the treatment of choice for mild dehydration. Solutions used for intravenous rehydration must be isotonic or hypertonic. Pure water injected into the veins will cause the breakdown (lysis) of red blood cells (erythrocytes).\n\nWhen fresh water is unavailable (e.g. at sea or in a desert), seawater and ethanol will worsen the condition. Urine contains a lower solute concentration than seawater, and numerous guides advise against its consumption in survival situations. If somebody is dehydrated and is taken to a hospital, IVs are also used.\n\nFor severe cases of dehydration where fainting, unconsciousness, or other severely inhibiting symptom is present (the patient is incapable of standing or thinking clearly), emergency attention is required. Fluids containing a proper balance of replacement electrolytes are given orally or intravenously with continuing assessment of electrolyte status; complete resolution is the norm in all but the most extreme cases.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "148628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=148628", "title": "Donald Pleasence", "text": "Donald Pleasence\n\nDonald Henry Pleasence, OBE (; 5 October 1919 – 2 February 1995) was an English actor. His most notable film roles include psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis in \"Halloween\" (1978) and four of its sequels, the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in the James Bond film \"You Only Live Twice\" (1967), RAF Flight Lieutenant Colin Blythe in \"The Great Escape\" (1963), SEN 5241 in \"THX 1138\" (1971), Clarence \"Doc\" Tydon in \"Wake in Fright\" (1971), and the President of the United States in \"Escape from New York\" (1981).\n\nPleasence was born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, England, the son of Alice (née Armitage) and Thomas Stanley Pleasence, a railway stationmaster. He was brought up as a strict Methodist in the small village of Grimoldby, Lincolnshire. He received his formal education at Crosby Junior School, Scunthorpe and Ecclesfield Grammar School, in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. After working as the Clerk-in-Charge at Swinton railway station in South Yorkshire, he decided that he wanted to be a professional actor, taking up a placement with the Jersey Repertory Company in 1939.\n\nIn December 1939, Pleasence initially refused conscription into the British Armed Forces, registering as a conscientious objector, but changed his stance in autumn 1940, after the attacks upon London by the Luftwaffe, and volunteered with the Royal Air Force. He served as aircraft wireless-operator with No. 166 Squadron in Bomber Command, with which he flew almost sixty raids against the Axis over occupied Europe. On 31 August 1944, Lancaster NE112, in which he was a crew member, was shot down during an attack upon Agenville, and he was captured and imprisoned in the German prisoner-of-war camp Stalag Luft I, where he was treated well reciprocally (like the British treated captured Luftwaffe pilots) in similar prisoner-of-war camps. Here, Pleasence produced and acted in many plays for the entertainment of his fellow captives. \n\nAfter the war and his release, he was discharged from the R.A.F. in 1946.\n\nReturning to acting post-war Pleasence resumed working in repertory theatre companies in Birmingham and Bristol. In the 1950s, Pleasence's stage work included performing as Willie Mossop in a 1952 production of \"Hobson's Choice\" at the Arts Theatre and as Dauphin in Jean Anouilh's \"The Lark\" (1956). In 1960, Pleasence won acclaim as the tramp in Harold Pinter's \"The Caretaker\" at the Arts Theatre, a role he would again play in a 1990 revival. Other stage work in the 1960s included Anouilh's \"Poor Bitos\" (1967) and Robert Shaw's \"The Man in the Glass Booth\" (1967), for which he won the London Variety Award for Stage Actor of the Year in 1968. Pleasence's later stage work included performing in a double bill of Pinter plays, \"The Basement\" and \"Tea Party\", at the Duchess Theatre in 1970.\n\nPleasence made his television debut in \"I Want to Be a Doctor\" (1946). In 1954, he received critical acclaim as Syme in a BBC adaptation of George Orwell's novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". The adaptation was by Nigel Kneale and also starred Peter Cushing, another British actor who would go on to find fame in many horror film roles.\n\nPleasence played Prince John in several episodes of the ITV series \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1956–1958). He appeared twice with Patrick McGoohan in the British spy series, \"Danger Man\", in episodes \"Position of Trust\" (1960) and \"Find and Return\" (1961). Pleasence's first appearance in America was in an episode of \"The Twilight Zone\", playing an ageing teacher at a boys' school in the episode \"The Changing of the Guard\" (1962). In 1963, he appeared in an episode of \"The Outer Limits\" entitled \"The Man With the Power\". In 1966, he also guest starred in an episode of \"The Fugitive\" entitled \"With Strings Attached\"\n\nIn 1973, Pleasence played a sympathetic murderer in an episode of \"Columbo\" entitled \"Any Old Port in a Storm\". He also portrayed a murderer captured by \"Mrs. Columbo\" in \"Murder Is a Parlor Game\" (1979). In 1978, he played a scout, Sam Purchas in an adaptation of James A. Michener's \"Centennial\". Pleasence starred as the Reverend Septimus Harding in the BBC's TV series \"The Barchester Chronicles\" (1982). In this series, his daughter Angela Pleasence played his onscreen daughter Susan.\n\nHe hosted the 1981 Halloween episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" with music guest Fear.\n\nIn 1986, Pleasence joined Ronald Lacey and Polly Jo Pleasence for the television thriller \"Into the Darkness\".\n\nPleasence made his big-screen debut with \"The Beachcomber\" (1954). Some notable early roles include Parsons in \"1984\" (1956), his second Orwell film, and minor roles opposite Alec Guinness in \"Barnacle Bill\" (1957) and Dirk Bogarde in \"The Wind Cannot Read\" (1958). In Tony Richardson's film of \"Look Back in Anger\" (1959), he plays a vindictive market inspector opposite Richard Burton. In the same year, Pleasence starred in the horror films \"Circus of Horrors\" directed by Sidney Hayers, playing the role of Vanet, the owner of a circus, and \"The Flesh and the Fiends\" as the real-life murderer William Hare, alongside Peter Cushing, George Rose and Billie Whitelaw. \n\nEndowed with a shiny bald head, a penetrating stare, and an intense voice, usually quiet but capable of a piercing scream, he specialised in portraying insane, fanatical, or evil characters, including the title role in \"Dr Crippen\" (1962), the double agent Dr Michaels in the sci-fi hit \"Fantastic Voyage\" (1966), the white trader who sells guns to the Cheyenne Indians in the revisionist western \"Soldier Blue\" (1970), the mad Doctor in the Bud Spencer–Terence Hill film \"Watch Out, We're Mad\" (1974), Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler in \"The Eagle Has Landed\" (1976), and the Bond arch-villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld in \"You Only Live Twice\" (1967), the first film in which the villain's face is clearly seen. His interpretation of the character has become predominant in popular culture considering the popularity of the comic villain, Dr. Evil in the successful \"Austin Powers\" film series, which primarily parodies it. In the crime drama \"Hell is a City\" (1960), shot in Manchester, he starred opposite Stanley Baker, whilst he was memorably cast in the horror comedy \"What a Carve Up!\" (1961) as the “horrible-looking zombie” solicitor opposite Shirley Eaton, Sid James, Kenneth Connor and Dennis Price.\n\nHe appeared as the POW forger Colin Blythe in the film \"The Great Escape\" (1963), who discovers that he is slowly going blind, but nonetheless participates in the mass break-out, only to be shot down by German soldiers because he is unable to see them. In \"The Night of the Generals\" (1967), he played another uncharacteristically sympathetic role, this time as an old-school German general involved in a plot to kill Adolf Hitler. In 1971, he returned to the realm of the deranged, delivering a \"tour de force\" performance in the role of an alcoholic Australian doctor in Ted Kotcheff's nightmarish outback drama \"Wake in Fright\".\n\nPleasence played Lucifer in the religious epic \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\" (1965). His character taking on many dark, shadowy human disguises throughout the film was unprecedented in breathing life into the Luke 4:13 phrase \"... he left Him until an opportune time ...\" He was one of many stars who were given cameos throughout the film.\n\nHe also acted in Roman Polanski's \"Cul-de-sac\" (1966), in which he portrayed the love-sodden husband of a much younger French wife (Françoise Dorléac). In 1968, he ventured successfully into American cowboy territory, playing a sadistic self-styled preacher who goes after stoic Charlton Heston in the Western \"Will Penny\".\n\nIn his later years, he portrayed Lucas Deranian in Walt Disney's \"Escape to Witch Mountain\" (1975), the Russian seeking to start a war between the United States and the Soviet Union in \"Telefon\" (1977), Dr. Sam Loomis in \"Halloween\" (1978), The teacher, Kantorek in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1979)\",\" Dr. Kobras in \"The Pumaman\" (1980) and the held-hostage President of the United States in \"Escape from New York\" (1981). The distinctive, rather sinister accent which Pleasence employed in this and other films may be credited to the elocution lessons he had as a child. He reprised his Dr. Sam Loomis role in \"Halloween II\" (1981), \"\" (1988), \"\" (1989) and \"\" (1995).\n\nPleasence admired Sir Laurence Olivier, with whom he worked on-stage in the 1950s, and later on the film version of \"Dracula\" (1979). Two years earlier, Pleasence did an amusingly broad impersonation of Olivier in the guise of a horror-film actor called \"Valentine De'ath\" in the film \"The Uncanny\" (1977). According to the film critic Kim Newman on a DVD commentary for \"Halloween II\", the reason for Pleasence’s lengthy filmography was that he never turned down any role that was offered.\n\nDuring the early 1960s, Pleasence recorded several children's-story records on the Atlas Record label. These were marketed as the Talespinners series in the United Kingdom. They were also released in the United States as Tale Spinners for Children by United Artists. The stories included \"Don Quixote\" and the \"Brave Little Tailor\".\n\nPleasence provided the voice-over for the British public information film, \"The Spirit of Dark and Lonely Water\" (1973). The film, intended to warn children of the dangers of playing near water, attained notoriety for allegedly giving children nightmares.\n\nPleasence was the author of the children's book \"Scouse the Mouse\" (1977) (London: New English Library), which was animated by Canadian animator/film director Gerald Potterton (a friend of the actor, who directed him in the Canadian film \"The Rainbow Boys\" (1973), retitled \"The Rainbow Gang\" for VHS release in the United States) and also adapted into a children's recording (Polydor Records, 1977) with Ringo Starr voicing the book's title character, Scouse the Mouse.\n\nIn his book \"British Film Character Actors\" (1982), Terence Pettigrew described him as 'a potent combination of eyes and voice. The eyes are mournful but they can also be sinister or seedy or just plain nutty.

{"id": "238033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238033", "title": "Electrocution", "text": "Electrocution\n\nElectrocution is death or serious injury caused by electric shock, electric current passing through the body. The word is derived from \"electro\" and \"execution\", but it is also used for accidental death. The word is also used to describe non-fatal injuries due to electricity. \n\nThe term \"electrocution\" was coined in 1889 in the US just before the first use of the electric chair and originally referred only to electrical execution and not to accidental or suicidal electrical deaths. However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word \"electrocution\" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical death from the new commercial electricity.\n\nIn the Netherlands in 1746 Pieter van Musschenbroek's lab assistant, Andreas Cuneus, received an extreme shock while working with a leyden jar, the first recorded injury from man-made electricity. By the mid-19th century high-voltage electrical systems came into use to power arc lighting for theatrical stage lighting and lighthouses leading to the first recorded accidental death in 1879 when a stage carpenter in Lyon, France touched a 250-volt wire. \n\nThe spread of arc light-based street lighting systems (which at the time ran at a voltages above 3,000 volts) after 1880 led to many people dying from coming in contact with these high-voltage lines, a strange new phenomenon which seemed to kill instantaneously without leaving a mark on the victim. This would lead to execution by electricity in the electric chair in the late 1890s as an official method of capital punishment in the U.S. state of New York, thought to be a more humane alternative to hanging. After an 1881 death in Buffalo, New York caused by a high voltage arc lighting system, a local dentist named Alfred P. Southwick sought to develop this phenomenon into a way to execute condemned criminals with him basing his device on form he knew well, a dental chair. \n\nThe next nine years saw promotion by Southwick, the New York state Gerry commission (which included Southwick) recommending execution by electricity, a June 4, 1888 law making it the state form of execution on January 2, 1889, and a further state committee of doctors and lawyers to finalize the details of the method used. \n\nThe adoption of the electric chair became mixed up in the \"war of currents\" between Thomas Edison's direct current system and industrialist George Westinghouse's alternating current system in 1889 when noted anti-AC activist Harold P. Brown became a consultant to the committee. Brown pushed, with the assistance and sometimes collusion of Edison Electric and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the Thomson-Houston Electric Company, for the successful adoption of alternating current to power the chair, an attempt to portray AC as a public menace and the \"executioners current\".\n\nIn May 1889 the state of New York sentenced its first criminal, a street merchant named William Kemmler, to be executed in their new form of capital punishment. Tabloid newspapers, trying to describe this new form of electrical execution, started settling on \"electrocution,\" a portmanteau word derived from \"electro\" and \"execution\". It was not the only choice of word people were considering. \"The New York Times\" editorial column noted words such as \"\"Westinghouse\"d\" (after the Westinghouse Electric alternating current equipment that was to be used), \"\"Gerry\"cide\" (after Elbridge Gerry who headed New York death penalty commission that suggested adopting the electric chair), and \"\"Brown\"ed\" (after anti-AC activist Harold P. Brown). Thomas Edison preferred the words \"dynamort\", \"ampermort\" and \"electromort\". \"The New York Times\" hated the word electrocution, describing it as being pushed forward by \"pretentious ignoramuses\".\n\nThe health hazard of an electric current flowing through the body depends on the amount of current and the length of time for which it flows, not merely on the voltage. However, a high voltage is required to produce a high current through the body. This is due to the relatively high resistance of skin when dry, requiring a high voltage to pass through. The severity of a shock also depends on whether the path of the current includes a vital organ. \n\nDeath can occur from any shock that carries enough sustained current to stop the heart. Low currents (70–700 mA) usually trigger fibrillation in the heart, which is reversible via defibrillator but is nearly always fatal without help. Currents as low as 30 mA AC or 300-500 mA DC applied to the body surface can cause fibrillation. Large currents (> 1 A) cause permanent damage via burns and cellular damage. \n\nThe voltage necessary to create current of a given level through the body varies widely with the resistance of the skin; wet or sweaty skin or broken skin can allow a larger current to flow. Whether an electric current is fatal is also dependent on the path it takes through the body, which depends in turn on the points at which the current enters and leaves the body. The current path must usually include either the heart or the brain to be fatal.\n\n\n"}

According to a British government document, they are intended to be limited to \"lines vital to the prosecution of war and to national survival\". The second category – Preference Category II – are for lines needed for the community and these and Preference Category II are limited in total to 10% of the exchange. All other users are in Category III.\n\nThe scheme was established in the 1950s.

Grecheskaya Operatsiya; ) was an organised mass persecution of the Greeks of the Soviet Union that was ordered by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Greeks often use the term \"pogrom\" (πογκρόμ) for this persecution, though this term usually refers to mob violence rather than persecution by police acting under direct orders, as this one was. It began on December 15, 1937 and marked the beginning of the repressions against Greeks went on for 13 years. Depending on the sources, it is estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 Greeks died by the end of this campaign.\n\nA wave of Greek emigrants from the Soviet Union in 1937—1939 is often considered a consequence of Stalinist persecution of the Soviet Greek national movement.\n\nThe 1926 Soviet census registered 213,765 Greeks in the country and 286,000 in the 1939 census. On 9 August 1937, NKVD order 00485 was adopted to target \"subversive activities of Polish intelligence\" in the Soviet Union, but was later expanded to also include Latvians, Germans, Estonians, Finns, Greeks, Iranians and Chinese. \n\nThe prosecution of Greeks in USSR was gradual: at first the authorities shut down the Greek schools, cultural centres, and publishing houses. Then, the secret police indiscriminately arrested all Greek men 16 years old or older. All Greeks who were wealthy or self-employed professionals were sought for prosecution first.\n\nOn many occasions, the central authorities sent telegrams to police forces with orders to arrest a certain number of Greeks, without giving any individual names, and the police officers would arrest at random any persons of Greek origin until they reached the requested total number of arrests, until the process was repeated at a later date. In all, some 50,000 Greeks died from this persecution.\n\nSome soures claim that there was no widespread counter-revolutionary activity among the Soviet Greeks, though there were exceptions in Constantine Kromiadi, an anti-communist of Greek origin, who was became later second in command in Andrey Vlasov \"Abwehr\" detachment during the Nazi German occupation of the Soviet Union in World War II and Vladimir Mikhailovich Despotuli.\n\nAbout one thousand Greeks from Greece and more from the Soviet Union, ostensibly avenging their ethnic persecution from Soviet authorities, joined the Waffen-SS, mostly in Ukrainian divisions. A special case was that of the infamous Ukrainian-Greek Sevastianos Foulidis, a fanatical anti-communist who had been recruited by the Abwehr as early as 1938 and became an official of the Wehrmacht, with extensive action in intelligence and agitation work in the Eastern front. \n\nIn 1938, 20,000 Soviet Greeks arrived in Greece. Between 1965 and 1975, another 15,000 Greeks emigrated from the Soviet Union and went to Greece. A monument to all Greek victims of GULAG was unveiled in Magadan in 2011. Unlike many other 'punished' ethnic groups, the Soviet Greeks were never officially rehabilitated by the Soviet legislation. In the early 1990s, a movement arose advocating a creation of a new Greek autonomy in the Krasnodar region, but it failed to achieve support. One Soviet Greek man, born in 1959, described this outcome with the following words:\n\nSoviet Greeks were officially rehabilitated, among with other ethnic groups by Russian Federation, amended by Decree no. 458 of September 12, 2015.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "22216147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22216147", "title": "Harassment", "text": "Harassment\n\nHarassment covers a wide range of behaviors of an offensive nature. It is commonly understood as behavior that demeans, humiliates or embarrasses a person, and it is characteristically identified by its unlikelihood in terms of social and moral reasonableness. In the legal sense, these are behaviors that appear to be disturbing, upsetting or threatening. It evolves from discriminatory grounds, and has an effect of nullifying or impairing a person from benefiting their rights. When this behaviors become repetitive it is defined as bullying. Sexual harassment refers to persistent and unwanted sexual advances even after gently refusing, typically in the workplace, where the consequences are potentially very disadvantageous to the victim if there is a power imbalance between the perpetuator.\n\nThe word is based in English since circa 1618 as a loan word from the French, which was in turn already attested in 1572 meaning \"torment, annoyance, bother, trouble\" and later as of 1609 was also referred to \"the condition of being exhausted, overtired\". Of the French verb \"harasser\" itself there are the first records in a Latin to French translation of 1527 of Thucydides’ History of the war that was between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians both in the countries of the Greeks and the Romans and the neighbouring places wherein the translator writes \"harasser\" allegedly meaning \"harceler\" (to exhaust the enemy by repeated raids); and in the military chant Chanson du franc archer of 1562, where the term is referred to a gaunt jument (\"de poil fauveau, tant maigre et harassée\": of fawn horsehair, so meagre and …) where it is supposed that the verb is used meaning \"overtired\".\n\nA hypothesis about the origin of the verb \"harasser\" is \"harace\"/\"harache\", which was used in the 14th century in expressions like \"courre à la harache\" (to pursue) and \"prendre aucun par la harache\" (to take somebody under constraint). The Französisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch, a German etymological dictionary of the French language (1922–2002) compares phonetically and syntactically both \"harace\" and \"harache\" to the interjection \"hare\" and \"haro\" by alleging a pejorative and augmentative form. The latter was an exclamation indicating distress and emergency (recorded since 1180) but is also reported later in 1529 in the expression \"crier haro sur\" (to arise indignation over somebody). \"hare\" 's use is already reported in 1204 as an order to finish public activities as fairs or markets and later (1377) still as command but referred to dogs. This dictionary suggests a relation of \"haro\"/\"hare\" with the old lower franconian \"*hara\" (here) (as by bringing a dog to heel).\n\nWhile the pejorative of an exclamation and in particular of such an exclamation is theoretically possible for the first word (\"harace\") and maybe phonetically plausible for \"harache\", a semantic, syntactic and phonetic similarity of the verb \"harasser\" as used in the first popular attestation (the chant mentioned above) with the word \"haras\" should be kept in mind: Already in 1160 \"haras\" indicated a group of horses constrained together for the purpose of reproduction and in 1280 it also indicated the enclosure facility itself, where those horses are constrained. The origin itself of \"harass\" is thought to be the old Scandinavian \"hârr\" with the Romanic suffix –as, which meant \"grey or dimmish horsehair\". Controversial is the etymological relation to the Arabic word for \"horse\" whose roman transliteration is faras.\n\nAlthough the French origin of the word 'harassment' is beyond all question in the Oxford English Dictionary and those dictionaries basing on it, a supposed Old French verb \"harer\" should be the origin of the French verb \"harasser\", despite the fact that this verb cannot be found in French etymologic dictionaries like that of the or the Trésor de la langue française informatisé (see also their corresponding websites as indicated in the interlinks); since the entry further alleges a derivation from \"hare\", like in the mentioned German etymological dictionary of the French language a possible misprint of \"harer\" = \"har/ass/er\" = \"harasser\" is plausible or cannot be excluded. In those dictionaries the relationship with \"harassment\" were an interpretation of the interjection \"hare\" as \"to urge a dog to attack', despite the fact that it should indicate a shout to come and not to go (\"hare\" = \"hara\" = \"here\"; cf. above). The American Heritage Dictionary prudently indicates this origin only as possible.\n\nElectronic harassment is the unproven belief of the use of electromagnetic waves to harass a victim. Psychologists have identified evidence of auditory hallucinations, delusional disorders, or other mental disorders in online communities supporting those who claim to be targeted.\n\nLandlord harassment is the willing creation, by a landlord or his agents, of conditions that are uncomfortable for one or more tenants in order to induce willing abandonment of a rental contract. Such a strategy is often sought because it avoids costly legal expenses and potential problems with eviction. This kind of activity is common in regions where rent control laws exist, but which do not allow the direct extension of rent-controlled prices from one tenancy to the subsequent tenancy, thus allowing landlords to set higher prices. Landlord harassment carries specific legal penalties in some jurisdictions, but enforcement can be very difficult or even impossible in many circumstances. However, when a crime is committed in the process and motives similar to those described above are subsequently proven in court, then those motives may be considered an aggravating factor in many jurisdictions, thus subjecting the offender(s) to a stiffer sentence.\n\nMobile harassment refers to the sending of any type of text message, photo message, video message, or voicemail from a mobile phone that threatens, torments, or humiliates the recipient of these messages. It is a form of cyber bullying.\n\nHarassment directs multiple repeating obscenities and derogatory comments at specific individuals focusing, for example, on the targets' race, religion, gender, nationality, disability, or sexual orientation. This often occurs in chat rooms, through newsgroups, and by sending hate e-mail to interested parties. This may also include stealing photos of the victim and their families, doctoring these photos in offensive ways, and then posting them on social media with the aim of causing emotional distress (see cyberbullying, cyberstalking, hate crime, online predator, and stalking).\n\nUnfair treatment conducted by law officials, including but not limited to excessive force, profiling, threats, coercion, and racial, ethnic, religious, gender/sexual, age, or other forms of discrimination.\n\nPower harassment is harassment or unwelcome attention of a political nature, often occurring in the environment of a workplace including hospitals, schools and universities. It includes a range of behavior from mild irritation and annoyances to serious abuses which can even involve forced activity beyond the boundaries of the job description. Power harassment is considered a form of illegal discrimination and is a form of political and psychological abuse, and bullying.\n\nThis is humiliating, intimidating or abusive behavior which is often difficult to detect, leaving no evidence other than victim reports or complaints. This characteristically lowers a person’s self-esteem or causes one to have overwhelming torment. This can take the form of verbal comments, engineered episodes of intimidation, aggressive actions or repeated gestures. Falling into this category is workplace harassment by individuals or groups mobbing.\n\nCommunity-based psychological harassment, meanwhile, is stalking by a group against an individual using repeated distractions that the individual is sensitized to. Media reports of large numbers of coordinated groups stalking individual stalking victims, including a press interview given by an active duty police lieutenant, have described this community-based harassment as gang stalking.\n\nThe targeting of an individual because of their race or ethnicity. The harassment may include words, deeds, and actions that are specifically designed to make the target feel degraded due to their race or ethnicity.\n\nVerbal, psychological or physical harassment is used against targets because they choose to practice a specific religion. Religious harassment can also include forced and involuntary conversions.\n\nSexual harassment is an offensive or humiliating behaviour that is related to a person's sex. It can be an subtle and overt sexual nature of a person (sexual annoyance), implied sexual conditions of a job (sexual coercion), etc. It can happen anywhere, but is most common in the workplace, schools, and the military. It involves unwanted and unwelcome words, deeds, actions, gestures, symbols, or behaviours of a sexual nature that make the target feel uncomfortable. Women are substantially more likely to be affected than men. The main focus of groups working against sexual harassment has been the protection of women, but in recent years awareness has grown of the need to protect LGBTQ, men and transgender people also.\n\nWorkplace harassment is the offensive, belittling or threatening behavior directed at an individual worker or a group of workers.\n\nRecently, matters of workplace harassment have gained interest among practitioners and researchers as it is becoming one of the most sensitive areas of effective workplace management. In Oriental countries, it attracted lots of attention from researchers and governments since the 1980s, because a significant source of work stress is associated with aggressive behaviors in the workplace. Under occupational health and safety laws around the world, workplace harassment and workplace bullying are identified as being core psychosocial hazards.\n\nHarassment, under the laws of the United States, is defined as any repeated or continuing un-consented contact that serves no useful purpose beyond creating alarm, annoyance, or emotional distress. In 1964, the United States Congress passed Title VII of the Civil Rights Act which prohibited discrimination at work on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin and sex. This later became the legal basis for early harassment law. The practice of developing workplace guidelines prohibiting harassment was pioneered in 1969, when the U.S. Department of Defense drafted a Human Goals Charter, establishing a policy of equal respect for both sexes. In \"Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson,\" : the U.S. Supreme Court recognized harassment suits against employers for promoting a sexually hostile work environment. In 2006, President George W. Bush signed a law which prohibited the transmission of annoying messages over the Internet (\"aka\" spamming) without disclosing the sender's true identity.\n\nThe LAD prohibits employers from discriminating in any job-related action, including recruitment, interviewing, hiring, promotions, discharge, compensation and the terms, conditions and privileges of employment on the basis of any of the law's specified protected categories. These protected categories are race, creed, color, national origin, nationality, ancestry, age, sex (including pregnancy and sexual harassment), marital status, domestic partnership status, affectional or sexual orientation, atypical hereditary cellular or blood trait, genetic information, liability for military service, or mental or physical disability, including HIV/AIDS and related illnesses. The LAD prohibits intentional discrimination based on any of these characteristics. Intentional discrimination may take the form of differential treatment or statements and conduct that reflect discriminatory animus or bias.\n\nIn 1984, the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibited sexual harassment in workplaces under federal jurisdiction.\n\nIn the UK, there are a number of laws protecting people from harassment, including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 and the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.\n\n"}

This day is January 2 in the gregorian calendar, but was different in the traditional Japanese calendar.\n\nIt is considered to be particularly good luck to dream of Mount Fuji, a hawk, and an eggplant. This belief has been in place since the early Edo period but there are various theories regarding the origins as to why this particular combination was considered to be auspicious. One theory suggests that this combination is lucky because Mount Fuji is Japan's highest mountain, the hawk is a clever and strong bird, and the word for eggplant (\"nasu\" or \"nasubi\" 茄子) suggests achieving something great (\"nasu\" 成す).

The term \"hot\" refers to the effective temperature used to model carrier density, not to the overall temperature of the device. Since the charge carriers can become trapped in the gate dielectric of a MOS transistor, the switching characteristics of the transistor can be permanently changed. Hot-carrier injection is one of the mechanisms that adversely affects the reliability of semiconductors of solid-state devices.\n\nThe term “hot carrier injection” usually refers to the effect in MOSFETs, where a carrier is injected from the conducting channel in the silicon substrate to the gate dielectric, which usually is made of silicon dioxide (SiO).\n\nTo become “hot” and enter the conduction band of SiO, an electron must gain a kinetic energy of ~3.2 eV. For holes, the valence band offset in this case dictates they must have a kinetic energy of 4.6 eV. The term \"hot electron\" comes from the effective temperature term used when modelling carrier density (i.e., with a Fermi-Dirac function) and does not refer to the bulk temperature of the semiconductor (which can be physically cold, although the warmer it is, the higher the population of hot electrons it will contain all else being equal).\n\nThe term “hot electron” was originally introduced to describe non-equilibrium electrons (or holes) in semiconductors. More broadly, the term describes electron distributions describable by the Fermi function, but with an elevated effective temperature. This greater energy affects the mobility of charge carriers and as a consequence affects how they travel through a semiconductor device.\n\n\"Hot electron\"s can tunnel out of the semiconductor material, instead of recombining with a hole or being conducted through the material to a collector. Consequent effects include increased leakage current and possible damage to the encasing dielectric material if the hot carrier disrupts the atomic structure of the dielectric.\n\nHot electrons can be created when a high-energy photon of electromagnetic radiation (such as light) strikes a semiconductor. The energy from the photon can be transferred to an electron, exciting the electron out of the valence band, and forming an electron-hole pair. If the electron receives enough energy to leave the valence band, and to surpass the conduction band, it becomes a hot electron. Such electrons are characterized by high effective temperatures. Because of the high effective temperatures, hot electrons are very mobile, and likely to leave the semiconductor and travel into other surrounding materials.\n\nIn some semiconductor devices, the energy dissipated by hot electron phonons represents an inefficiency as energy is lost as heat. For instance, some solar cells rely on the photovoltaic properties of semiconductors to convert light to electricity. In such cells, the hot electron effect is the reason that a portion of the light energy is lost to heat rather than converted to electricity.\n\nHot electrons arise generically at low temperatures even in degenerate semiconductors or metals. There are a number of models to describe the hot-electron effect. The simplest predicts an electron-phonon (e-p) interaction based on a clean three-dimensional free-electron model. Hot electron effect models illustrate a correlation between power dissipated, the electron gas temperature and overheating.\n\nIn MOSFETs, hot electrons have sufficient energy to tunnel through the thin oxide gate to show up as gate current, or as substrate leakage current. The hot electrons may jump from the channel region or from the drain, for instance, and into the gate or the substrate.\n\nFor instance, in a MOSFET, when a gate is positive, and the switch is on, the device is designed with the intent that electrons will flow through the conductive channel to the drain. These hot electrons do not contribute to the amount of current flowing through the channel as intended and instead are a leakage current.\n\nAttempts to correct or compensate for the hot electron effect in a MOSFET may involve locating a diode in reverse bias at gate terminal or other manipulations of the device (such as lightly doped drains or double-doped drains).\n\nWhen electrons are accelerated in the channel, they gain energy along the mean free path.\nThis energy is lost in two different ways:\n\n\nThe probability to hit either an atom or a Si-H bond is random, and the average energy involved in each process is the same in both case.\n\nThis is the reason why the substrate current is monitored during HCI stress.\nA high substrate current means a large number of created electron-hole pairs and thus an efficient Si-H bond breakage mechanism.\n\nWhen interface states are created, the threshold voltage is modified and the subthreshold slope is degraded. This leads to lower current, and degrades the operating frequency of integrated circuit.\n\nAdvances in semiconductor manufacturing techniques and ever increasing demand for faster and more complex integrated circuits (ICs) have driven the associated Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) to scale to smaller dimensions.\n\nHowever, it has not been possible to scale the supply voltage used to operate these ICs proportionately due to factors such as compatibility with previous generation circuits, noise margin, power and delay requirements, and non-scaling of threshold voltage, subthreshold slope, and parasitic capacitance.\n\nAs a result, internal electric fields increase in aggressively scaled MOSFETs, which comes with the additional benefit of increased carrier velocities (up to velocity saturation), and hence increased switching speed, but also presents a major reliability problem for the long term operation of these devices, as high fields induce hot carrier injection which affects device reliability.\n\nLarge electric fields in MOSFETs imply the presence of high-energy carriers, referred to as “hot carriers”. These hot carriers that have sufficiently high energies and momenta to allow them to be injected from the semiconductor into the surrounding dielectric films such as the gate and sidewall oxides as well as the buried oxide in the case of silicon on insulator (SOI) MOSFETs.\n\nThe presence of such mobile carriers in the oxides triggers numerous physical damage processes that can drastically change the device characteristics over prolonged periods. The accumulation of damage can eventually cause the circuit to fail as key parameters such as threshold voltage shift due to such damage. The accumulation of damage resulting degradation in device behavior due to hot carrier injection is called “hot carrier degradation”.\n\nThe useful life-time of circuits and integrated circuits based on such a MOS device are thus affected by the life-time of the MOS device itself. To assure that integrated circuits manufactured with minimal geometry devices will not have their useful life impaired, the life-time of the component MOS devices must have their HCI degradation well understood. Failure to accurately characterize HCI life-time effects can ultimately affect business costs such as warranty and support costs and impact marketing and sales promises for a foundry or IC manufacturer.\n\nHot carrier degradation is fundamentally the same as the ionization radiation effect known as the total dose damage to semiconductors, as experienced in space systems due to solar proton, electron, X-ray and gamma ray exposure.\n\nHCI is the basis of operation for a number of non-volatile memory technologies such as EPROM cells. As soon as the potential detrimental influence of HC injection on the circuit reliability was recognized, several fabrication strategies were devised to reduce it without compromising the circuit performance.\n\nNOR flash memory exploits the principle of hot carriers injection by deliberately injecting carriers across the gate oxide to charge the floating gate. This charge alters the MOS transistor threshold voltage to represent a logic '0' state. An uncharged floating gate represents a '1' state. Erasing the NOR Flash memory cell removes stored charge through the process of Fowler–Nordheim tunneling.\n\nBecause of the damage to the oxide caused by normal NOR Flash operation, HCI damage is one of the factors that cause the number of write-erase cycles to be limited. Because the ability to hold charge and the formation of damage traps in the oxide affects the ability to have distinct '1' and '0' charge states, HCI damage results in the closing of the non-volatile memory logic margin window over time. The number of write-erase cycles at which '1' and '0' can no longer be distinguished defines the endurance of a non-volatile memory.\n\n\n"}

It states that the late 19th century was a dangerous era for the Roman Catholic Church, largely due to numerous concepts and practices it attributes to Freemasonry, namely naturalism, popular sovereignty, and the separation of church and state.\n\nSome of the strictures found in \"Humanum genus\" still remain in force today.\n\nFollowing the French withdrawal of its military garrison in Rome in the anticipation of the Franco-Prussian War, the 1870 Capture of Rome itself was a major battle within the long process of Italian unification known as the Risorgimento, marking the final military defeat of the Papal States under Pope Pius IX by the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nThis unification of the Italian peninsula by King Victor Emmanuel II of the House of Savoy ended the approximate 1,116 year temporal reign (AD 754 to 1870) of the Papal States by the papacy.\n\n\"Humanum genus\" asserted that the late 19th century was a time of particular danger for Roman Catholics as the \"partisans of evil\" were now far less secretive, as evidenced by the new openness of Freemasonry. Freemasonry had been condemned by previous popes as being contrary to Catholic doctrine, but according to \"Humanum genus\", the nature of Freemasonry was changing as Freemasons were far more open in society with their practices and affiliations.\n\n\"Humanum genus\" specifically condemned certain practices of the Freemasons, including: religious indifference; the promotion of public education that denied the Church's role and where \"the education of youth shall be exclusively in the hands of laymen\"; the approval of the notion that the people are the \"only\" source of sovereignty, and that those who rule have no authority but by the commission and concession of the people.\n\nThe Holy See has forbidden Roman Catholics from becoming Freemasons since 1738 with the issuing of the Pope Clement XII's bull \"In eminenti apostolatus\". This prohibition remains in effect today.\n\nSeveral popes before Leo XIII had addressed the problems that they associated with Freemasonry and said that the principles of that secret society were incompatible with the teachings of the Church. Previous papal pronouncements on Freemasonry include:\n\n\nLeo XIII's denunciation of Freemasonry in \"Humanum genus\" can be seen as a call for Roman Catholics to oppose it, especially in the context of his examination of socialism (\"Quod apostolici muneris\"), his defence of Christian marriage (\"Arcanum\"), and his ideas about the role of government (\"Diuturnum\"). Because of the secrecy in Freemasonry, it was believed by the Holy See to have enormous disciplinary control over its members, which Leo viewed as enslavement. By this definition, although individual Masons may be decent people, those same individuals would be led to commit evil acts through their participation in Freemasonry.\n\n\"Humanum genus\" leads with the presentation of the Augustinian dichotomy of the two cities, the City of Man and the City of God. The human race is presented as \"separated into two diverse and opposite parts, of which the one steadfastly contends for truth and virtue, the other of those things which are contrary to virtue and to truth. The one is the kingdom of God on earth, namely, the true Church of Jesus Christ... The other is the kingdom of Satan,\" which was \"led on or assisted\" by Freemasonry:At every period of time each has been in conflict with the other, with a variety and multiplicity of weapons and of warfare, although not always with equal ardour and assault. At this period, however, the partisans of evil seems to be combining together, and to be struggling with united vehemence, led on or assisted by that strongly organized and widespread association called the Freemasons. No longer making any secret of their purposes, they are now boldly rising up against God Himself. They are planning the destruction of holy Church publicly and openly, and this with the set purpose of utterly despoiling the nations of Christendom, if it were possible, of the blessings obtained for us through Jesus Christ our Saviour. Lamenting these evils, We are constrained by the charity which urges Our heart to cry out often to God: \"For lo, Thy enemies have made a noise; and they that hate Thee have lifted up the head. They have taken a malicious counsel against Thy people, and they have consulted against Thy saints. They have said, 'come, and let us destroy them, so that they be not a nation.'\n\"Humanum genus\" depicted the fundamental doctrine of Freemasonry as naturalism, asserting that this leads to deism and Gnosticism. This was seen as driving Freemasons headlong toward a fundamental clash with the teachings of the Church, especially in light of Freemasons' support of separation of church and state by their efforts to enact and enforce civil constitutional obstacles to the establishment of state churches.\n\n\"Humanum genus\" criticizes a number of other Masonic principles; for example, the idea that popular sovereignty is the source of \"all\" rights and that man should bend to no authority other than himself:\nThen come their doctrines of politics, in which the naturalists lay down that all men have the same right, and are in every respect of equal and like condition; that each one is naturally free; that no one has the right to command another; that it is an act of violence to require men to obey any authority other than that which is obtained from themselves.Section 2335 of the Code of Canon Law (1917) declares that \"Those who join a Masonic sect or other societies of the same sort, which plot against the Church or against legitimate civil authority, incur \"ipso facto\" an excommunication simply reserved to the Holy See.\"\nThe Code of Canon Law was updated in 1983, amending the prior Section 2335 with the new Section 1374. The revision omits any direct reference to Freemasonry: \"A person who joins an association which plots against the Church is to be punished with a just penalty; one who promotes or takes office in such an association is to be punished with an interdict.\"\n\nCardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith under Pope John Paul II and himself elected as Pope Benedict XVI on 19 April 2005, issued the 26 November 1983 \"Declaration on Masonic Associations\", which in part states:\n\n\"Therefore the Church's negative judgment in regard to Masonic association remains unchanged since their principles have always been considered irreconcilable with the doctrine of the Church and therefore membership in them remains forbidden. The faithful who enroll in Masonic associations are in a state of grave sin and may not receive Holy Communion...In an audience granted to the undersigned Cardinal Prefect, the Supreme Pontiff John Paul II approved and ordered the publication of this Declaration which had been decided in an ordinary meeting of this Sacred Congregation.\"\nFinally, \"Humanum genus\" condemns what it presents as the Masonic idea of the separation of religion and state:It is held also that the State should be without God; that in the various forms of religion there is no reason why one should have precedence of another; and that they are all to occupy the same place.\n\nDuring a 28 July 2013 interview with reporters on a return flight to Rome, Pope Francis identified political lobbying at the Vatican, and specifically addresses the influence of \"Masonic lobbying\", as being a component of the \"most serious problem\" confronting his papacy.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35254468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35254468", "title": "I Dreamed a Dream (musical)", "text": "I Dreamed a Dream (musical)\n\nI Dreamed a Dream is a jukebox musical with a book co-written by Alan McHugh and Elaine C. Smith and produced by Michael Harrison. It is based on the life of Susan Boyle and her 2010 autobiography, \"The Woman I Was Born to Be\". The score features songs recorded by Boyle, hymns, traditional songs and popular songs, mostly from the 1960s to the 1980s.\n\nThe show premiered on 27 March 2012 at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle, directed by Ed Curtis and choreographed by Nick Winston. Smith stars as Susan Boyle, and Boyle herself sings two songs at the end of most performances. It has received generally favourable reviews. The production's tour of the UK and Ireland continued through much of 2012.\n\nSusan muses to the audience about childhood dreams (\"I Dreamed a Dream\"). The adult Susan, as narrator, explains that she is a shy, sometimes awkward person who doesn't know what to say to others. But she means to tell her \"fairy tale\" story. It starts with the birth of a baby girl, in Scotland on 1 April 1961, an April Fool's Day baby. A doctor tells her parents, Bridie and Patrick Boyle, that the baby may suffer from brain damage due to deprivation of oxygen, telling them not to expect too much from her. Bridie and Pat are worried yet hopeful (\"Joy is in the Child\").\n\nCouples celebrate Susan's first communion (\"Welcome to My World\"). Guests sing (\"Paper Roses\" and \"The Wild Rover\"), but everyone is looking forward to Patrick Boyle singing his signature song, \"Scarlet Ribbons\", which he dedicates to Susan. He is able to \"stop a room\" with his singing, and Susan hopes someday to do the same. Susan's singing talent is discovered at school by the music teacher. But she suffers bullying and a beating by classmates (\"The Four Marys\"). Her friend John drives away the bullies. Years later, parents in tow, Susan meets John again at a parish dance, where he invites an incredulous Susan, who has never had a boyfriend, to dance with him (\"Beautiful Sunday\", \"Knock Three Times\", \"Una Paloma Blanca\"). Their comic, awkward efforts eventually turn dreamily romantic (\"Perfect Day\").\n\nSusan goes to The Happy Valley pub's karaoke night, presided over by an Elvis-imitating compere who fancies himself the best singer around (\"Something Tells Me\"). Several regulars attempt to impress (\"Crazy\" and \"Heartbreak Hotel\"), and Susan's old school friend Lorraine persuades her to try. Susan tentatively sings \"Someone To Watch Over Me\". When she spots John, her confidence increases, and Susan \"stops the room\". The jealous compere foreshadows subsequent criticisms, saying that while Susan can sing, the only reason the pub crowd reacted as they did was because they weren't expecting it, and felt they owed her an apology for thinking she was a daftie.\n\nTheir romance budding, Susan and John talk on the phone playfully, but it ends suddenly when Susan's father slams down the phone set and tells her that she isn't ready for a boyfriend. Susan is depressed and lost (\"At Seventeen\"), not knowing how to go on with her life; the only role she knows for a Blackburn girl, marriage and having kids, is taken away from her. She decides that since singing is the only thing she's good at, she should take lessons, and goes to see voice teacher Fred O'Neil. He signs her up for the Miner's Welfare competition, and Susan wins the £1000 prize (\"Daydream Believer\").\n\nPatrick Boyle becomes ill and dies. Grieving, Bridie and Susan express their farewells to Patrick (Medley: \"How Great Thou Art\", \"The Prayer\" and \"Scarlet Ribbons\"). Susan's sister Kathleen dies unexpectedly from an asthma attack. Susan now must take care of her elderly mother. Bridie urges Susan to get on with her life, to make something of her singing. She is hopeful for Susan and inspires Susan to be hopeful too (\"This Will Be the Year\"). Then Bridie dies. Susan is despondent, alone for the first time in her life (\"Return\").\n\nSusan reminds the audience that this is a fairy tale. Susan sees an ad for a national talent contest. At \"Britain's Got Talent\" auditions, Susan is almost turned away as she signs in. She meets her fellow audition hopefuls, a collection of clowns, blue-wigged tap dancers and musicians of several sorts (\"Stuck in the Middle with You\"). Susan waits as they succeed or fail, and then it is her turn. Onstage, mic in hand, Susan answers the sceptical judges' questions. She sings \"I Dreamed a Dream\" and is astonished but ecstatic to hear the huge crowd's standing ovation.\n\nSusan goes home to twelve weeks of waiting, not allowed to tell anyone about her success. As the broadcast time approaches, Susan tries unsuccessfully to get the priest, the crossing guard, and a neighbour to be sure to watch the show Saturday night without telling them why. Lorraine watches the broadcast of Susan's audition with her, and both are caught off-guard by her sudden popularity as her YouTube video goes viral, spreading Susan's fame worldwide. The media hounds Susan and goads her into outbursts of profanity to write about in their papers, with headlines like \"Hairy Angel, Never Been Kissed\" (\"Mad World\"). Then come the broadcasts of the semi-final and final, where after seventeen agonising seconds an exhausted Susan hears that she finished as runner-up to the Diversity dance troupe. Susan feels desolate, convinced that losing means any chance for a singing career is gone (\"End of the World\").\n\nWhile she is hospitalised, Andy Stephens speaks to her about starting her career as a singer, but she won't listen to him (\"Don't Dream It's Over\"). Her mother appears to scold her for giving in to depression and not keeping her promise to make something of herself. Lorraine and Andy call on Susan at home, but Susan doesn't remember meeting Andy. He offers to be her manager, taking care of everything she needs. Susan is afraid of singing in front of people, but Andy tells her that she won't have to, because she'll be in the studio making an album. Susan is happier than she's ever been as she sets to work to record her album (\"Wild Horses\").\n\nThe album becomes the fastest-selling debut album in British history and races to number one on both sides of the Atlantic. Susan goes to New York to promote it, to appear in Rockefeller Plaza before an audience of a thousand people. She is terrified, screaming and crying, telling Andy that she cannot sing in front of all those people. When Andy replies that if this is what live performing does to her, then it's not worth it, Susan realises that she has a choice. She wants to sing and doesn't want to go back to her old life; her mother would be in a rage if she didn't go on. Susan conquers her fear and goes on (\"Up to the Mountain\"). Her journey is not over.\n\nThe principal roles and original tour cast are as follows:\n\nSpecial guest: Susan Boyle\n\n\nThe musical received generally positive reviews following its opening in Newcastle. Dominic Cavendish in \"The Daily Telegraph\" wrote in his 5-star review: \"The overall shape of the show is hard to fault, and in matching the gutsy good humour of its heroine without stooping to hagiography, this is a delight that deserves to go far, and fast, as she has done.\" John Dixon's 5-star review in WhatsOnStage.com concluded: \"The scene where Susan’s father ... dies is one of the most emotional I have seen on stage, while those backstage at the auditions for BGT are nothing short of inspirational. This production is a standalone show that should still play to audiences long after Elaine C Smith and Susan Boyle have left. ... There is no doubting \"I Dreamed A Dream\" is one of the musical events of the year.\"\n\nNeil Norman, in the \"Daily Express\", also gave a 5-star review, writing: \"The script is terrific, with proper acknowledgement of the envy Boyle's success sparked in others, the toll it took on her health both mental and physical and her initial treatment by the savage apostates of the press. Smith is astonishingly good as Boyle, not impersonating her so much as capturing her essence, and she is supported by an amazingly versatile cast, among whom James Paterson stands out as Boyle's father. A hugely uplifting evening.\" Libby Purves in \"The Times\" gave the musical a 4-star review, writing: \"Kennedy Aitchinson's cunning arrangements and Ed Curtis' deft direction use juke-boxery better than I have ever seen.\" Lisa Verrico added a 4-star review in \"The Sunday Times\", writing: \"A simple set suits the gutsy, glitz-free production. There is a lovely symmetry to the script.\" Joyce McMillan, in her 4-star review for \"The Scotsman\", called the show: \"A vigorous, thoughtful and inspiring tribute.\"\n\nIn the \"Daily Mail\", Patrick Marmion awarded 3 stars, writing that the show is \"more than just a get-rich-quick scheme. ... It's also a jolly good knees-up. Between moments of throat-clearing reverentiality and tear-stained crooning, there is much fun to be had.\" \"The Guardian\" also gave a 3-star review. Alun Palmer in the \"Daily Mirror\" was one of few dissenting voices, writing, \"only an exuberant working of \"Stuck in the Middle With You\" ... adds a level of humour and polish to what is rather leaden fare. At times it was like a very long Morecambe and Wise musical interlude. ... Smith ... promises a sprinkling of fairy dust on the story but what we get is a dumper truck's worth. No cliché is left unturned and no mention is made of Simon Cowell, which is curious to say the least.\" In the \"ChronicleLive\", however, Gordon Barr wrote: \"If you are lucky enough to have Susan perform at the end of the show, it is the icing on an already delicious and multi-layered cake!\"\n\nBoyle said she was initially upset by the show, because she was \"not used to it\", but she later found it \"clever and amusing\".\n\nFox Searchlight have bought life rights to Susan Boyle along with rights to the musical \"I Dreamed a Dream\". They plan to develop a film version of the musical creating a sensitive biopic.\n\n"}

This prompted widespread debate, with former swimmer Shane Gould asserting that the selection policy should be relaxed to maximise Australia's chances by selecting Thorpe, while Talbot, head coach Leigh Nugent and Kieren Perkins defended the selection policy. Public debate was also widespread, with Prime Minister of Australia John Howard describing the situation as a \"tragedy\".\n\nDespite the intense media spotlight, Thorpe won the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events in times of 48.83s and 1 min 45.07s respectively to ensure his selection for Athens. Craig Stevens, who had claimed the second qualifying position in the 400 m event, subsequently faced immense public pressure to relinquish his position to Thorpe, with \"The Australian\"s front-page headline reading \"Only one man can come to the rescue\". Although Thorpe said that Stevens should not be pressured into stepping aside, he was also criticised by columnists who felt that he was implicitly pressuring Stevens, for not unequivocally ruling himself out. Stevens later relinquished the position, in an interview with the Seven Network, who paid him A$130,000 for the rights to broadcast his announcement. This generated ethical debate as to whether Stevens had made a decision in the national interest or sold Thorpe a gold medal, with \"The Sydney Morning Herald\"s headline reading \"It's your race, Ian, at $325 a metre\".\n\nThorpe accepted the position and was further attacked by Perkins, who described the affair as \"grubby\" and \"a very, very sad tale for Australian sport\", saying the pressure put upon Stevens was \"disgusting\".\n"}

The mission, planned for a 2019 launch, is to provide a conceptual design of a lunar observatory that would be reliable, low cost, and fast to implement. Also, it is hoped to be a technology precursor to a 2-meter dish radio observatory (ILOweb) on the Moon, and other commercial initiatives.\n\nThe ILO-1 mission, announced on July 2017, is being organized by the International Lunar Observatory Association (ILOA) and the Space Age Publishing Company. The prime contractors are Moon Express, providing the MX-1E lander, and Canadensys Aerospace, that is providing the optical telescope system. The estimated cost in 2004 was of $50 million USD.\n\nThe ILO-1 mission, originally planned to be launched in 2008, is now scheduled to be launched in 2019 with an Electron rocket from New Zealand. The mission is called \"Moon Express Lunar Scout\", and it will use the MX-1E lander to deliver the observatory on top of the Malapert Mountain, a 5 km tall peak in the Aitken Basin region that has an uninterrupted direct line of sight to Earth, which facilitates communications any time.\n\nThe small robotic observatory is designed to withstand the long lunar nights so it is expected to operate for a few years. Moon Express will also utilize the mission to explore the Moon's South Pole for mineral resources including water ice. The optical portion of the system is a Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope. The optical system uses a 7 cm diameter lens, with an 18 cm focal plane, a 13 cm f/5.6 aperture, and 6.4-megapixel resolution. The telescope system is \"about the size of a shoe-box\" with a mass of approximately 2 kg.\n\nSome partners include the National Astronomical Observatory of China (NAOC), Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), the newly formed Southeast Asia Principal Operating Partnership, and others.\n\nThe mission's objective is to conduct astrophysical observations from the surface of the Moon, whose lack of atmosphere eliminates much of the need for costly adaptive optics technology. Also, since the Moon's days (about fourteen Earth days) have a dark sky, it allows for nonstop astronomical observations. Disadvantages include micrometeorite impacts, cosmic and solar radiation, lunar dust, and temperature shifts as large as 350° Celsius. The mission aims to acquire images of galaxies, stars, planets, the Moon and Earth. The project will promote commercial access to the telescope use to schools, scientists and the public at large through the Internet.\n\nOther two unrelated secondary payloads on the lander are a Celestis memorial, and a lunar laser ranging experiment called MoonLIGHT.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3433405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3433405", "title": "Japanese economic miracle", "text": "Japanese economic miracle\n\nThe Japanese economic miracle was Japan's record period of economic growth between the post-World War II era to the end of the Cold War. During the economic boom, Japan rapidly became the world's second largest economy (after the United States). By the 1990s, Japan's demographics began stagnating and the workforce was no longer expanding as it did in previous decades, despite per-worker productivity remaining high.\n\nThis economic miracle was the result of post-World War II Japan and West Germany benefiting from the Cold War. It occurred chiefly due to the economic interventionism of the Japanese government and partly due to the aid and assistance of the U.S. Marshall Plan. After World War II, the U.S. established a significant presence in Japan to slow the expansion of Soviet influence in the Pacific. The U.S. was also concerned with the growth of the economy of Japan because there was a risk after World War II that an unhappy and poor Japanese population would turn to communism and by doing so ensure that the Soviet Union would control the Pacific.\n\nThe distinguishing characteristics of the Japanese economy during the \"economic miracle\" years included: the cooperation of manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and banks in closely knit groups called \"keiretsu\"; the powerful enterprise unions and \"shuntō\"; good relations with government bureaucrats, and the guarantee of lifetime employment (\"shūshin koyō\") in big corporations and highly unionized blue-collar factories.\n\nThe Japanese financial recovery continued even after SCAP departed and the economic boom propelled by the Korean War abated. The Japanese economy survived from the deep recession caused by a loss of the U.S. payments for military procurement and continued to make gains. By the late 1960s, Japan had risen from the ashes of World War II to achieve an astoundingly rapid and complete economic recovery. According to Mikiso Hane, the period leading up to the late 1960s saw \"the greatest years of prosperity Japan had seen since the Sun Goddess shut herself up behind a stone door to protest her brother Susano-o's misbehavior.\" The Japanese government contributed to the post-war Japanese economic miracle by stimulating private sector growth, first by instituting regulations and protectionism that effectively managed economic crises and later by concentrating on trade expansion.\n\nJapanese economic miracle refers to the significant increase in the Japanese economy during the time between the end of World War II and the end of the Cold War (1945-1993). The economical miracle can be divided into four stages: the recovery (1946-1954), the high increase (1955-1972), the steady increase (1972-1992), and the low increase (1992-2018).\n\nThough heavily destroyed by the nuclear bombardment in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and other Allied air raids on Japan, Japan was able to recover from the trauma of WWII, and managed to become the second largest economic entity of the world (after the United States) by the 1960s (Soviet Union excluded). However, after three decades, Japan had experienced the so-called \"recession in growth\", as the United States had been imposing economic protection policy in oppressing Japanese production and forcing the appreciation of the Japanese yen. In preventing further oppression, Japan greatly improved its technological advances and raised the value of the yen, since to devalue, the yen would have brought further risk and a possible depressing effect on trade. The appreciation of the yen led to significant economic recession in the 1980s. To alleviate the influence of recession, Japan imposed a series of economical and financial policy to stimulate the domestic demand. Nevertheless, the bubble economy that took place in the late 1980s and early 1990s and the subsequent deflationary policy destroyed the Japanese economy. After the deflationary policy, the Japanese economy has been through a time of low increase period which has lasted until today. For more detailed information regarding this period, see Economic history of Japan and Lost Decade (Japan).\n\nJapan was seriously harmed in WWII. For instance, during the wartime, \"the Japanese cotton industry was brought to its knees by the end of the Second World War. Two-thirds of its prewar cotton spindles were scrapped by wartime administrators, and bombing and destruction of urban areas had caused a further loss of 20 percent of spinning and 14 percent of weaving capacity\". Nonetheless, the ability of recovery astonished the world, earning the title of \"Japanese Economic Miracle\". By and large, every country has experienced some degree of industrial growth in the postwar period, those countries that achieved a heavy drop in industrial output due to war damage such as Japan, West Germany and Italy, have achieved a most rapid recovery. In the case of Japan, industrial production had fallen in 1946 to 27.6% of the pre-war level, but regained this pre-war level in 1951 and reached 350% in 1960.\n\nThe first reason for Japan to recover from war trauma swiftly was the successful economic reform by the government. The government body principally concerned with industrial policy in Japan is the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. One of the major economic reforms was to adopt the \"Inclined Production Mode\" (けいしゃせいさんほうしき). The \"Inclined Production Mode\" refers to the inclined production that primarily focus on the production of raw material including steel, coal and cotton. Textile production occupied more than 23.9% of the total industrial production. Moreover, to stimulate the production, Japanese government supported the new recruitment of labour, especially female labour. By enhancing the recruitment of female labour, Japan managed to recover from the destruction. The legislation on recruitment contains three components: the restriction placed on regional recruitment and relocation of workers, the banning of the direct recruitment of new school leavers, and the direct recruitment of non-school leavers under explicitly detailed regulations issued by the Ministry of Labor.\n\nThe second reason that accounts for Japan's rapid recovery from WWII was the outbreak of Korean War, as Japan was favored by the Special Procurement. The Korean War was fought on the Korean Peninsula, and the United States eventually participated in the war, providing an opportunity for the Japanese economy. The Korean Peninsula is distant from US territory, so the logistics soon became a significant problem. As one of the major supporters of the United States in Asia, Japan stood out, providing ample support to logistical operations, and also benefitting from the production of firearms. The order of mass firearms and other material by the United States greatly stimulated the Japanese economy, enabling Japan to recover from the wartime destruction and providing Japan the basis for the upcoming high increasing stage.\n\nAfter gaining support from the United States and achieving domestic economic reform, Japan was able to soar from the 1950s to the 1970s. Furthermore, Japan also completed its process toward industrialization, and became one of the first developed countries in East Asia. The Japanese Economic Yearbooks from 1967 to 1971 witnessed the significant increase. In 1967, the year book said: the Japanese economy in 1966 thus made an advance more rapidly than previously expected. In 1968, the year book said that the Japanese economy continued to make a sound growth after it had a bottom in the autumn of 1965. The words \"increase\", \"growth\" and \"upswing\" filled with summaries of the year books from 1967 to 1971. The reasons for Japan to complete industrialization are also complicated, and the major characteristic of this time is the influence of governmental policies of the Hayato Ikeda administration, vast consumption, and vast export.\n\nIn 1954, the economic system MITI had cultivated from 1949 to 1953 came into full effect. Prime Minister Hayato Ikeda, who Johnson calls \"the single most important individual architect of the Japanese economic miracle,\" pursued a policy of heavy industrialization. This policy led to the emergence of 'over-loaning' (a practice that continues today) in which the Bank of Japan issues loans to city banks who in turn issue loans to industrial conglomerates. Since there was a shortage of capital in Japan at the time, industrial conglomerates borrowed beyond their capacity to repay, often beyond their net worth, causing city banks in turn to overborrow from the Bank of Japan. This gave the national Bank of Japan complete control over dependent local banks.\n\nThe system of over-loaning, combined with the government's relaxation of anti-monopoly laws (a remnant of SCAP control) also led to the reemergence of conglomerate groups called \"keiretsu\" that mirrored the wartime conglomerates, or \"zaibatsu\". Led by the economic improvements of Sony businessmen Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita, the \"keiretsu\" efficiently allocated resources and became competitive internationally.\n\nAt the heart of the \"keiretsu\" conglomerates' success lay city banks, which lent generously, formalizing cross-share holdings in diverse industries. The \"keiretsu\" spurred both horizontal and vertical integration, locking out foreign companies from Japanese industries. \"Keiretsu\" had close relations with MITI and each other through the cross-placement of shares, providing protection from foreign take-overs. For example, 83% of Japan's Development Bank's finances went toward strategic industries: shipbuilding, electric power, coal and steel production. \"Keiretsu\" proved crucial to protectionist measures that shielded Japan's sapling economy.\n\n\"Keiretsu\" also fostered an attitude shift among Japanese managers that tolerated low profits in the short-run because \"keiretsu\" were less concerned with increasing stock dividends and profits and more concerned about interest payments. Approximately only two-thirds of the shares of a given company were traded, cushioning \"keiretsu\" against market fluctuations and allowing \"keiretsu\" managers to plan for the long-term and maximize market shares instead of focusing on short-term profits.\n\nThe Ikeda Administration also instituted the Foreign Exchange Allocation Policy, a system of import controls designed to prevent the flooding of Japan's markets by foreign goods. MITI used the foreign exchange allocation to stimulate the economy by promoting exports, managing investment and monitoring production capacity. In 1953, MITIs revised the Foreign Exchange Allocation Policy to promote domestic industries and increase the incentive for exports by revising the export-link system. A later revision based production capacity on foreign exchange allocation to prevent foreign dumping.\n\nDuring the time of reconstruction and before the 1973 oil crisis, Japan managed to complete its industrialization process, gaining significant improvement in living standards and witnessing a significant increase in consumption. The average monthly consumption of urban family households doubled from 1955 to 1970. Moreover, the proportions of consumption in Japan was also changing. The consumption in daily necessities, such as food and clothing and footwear, was decreasing. Contrastingly, the consumption in recreational, entertainment activities and goods increased, including furniture, transportation, communications, and reading. The great increase in consumption stimulated the growth in GDP as it incentivized production.\n\nThe period of rapid economic growth between 1955 and 1961 paved the way for the \"Golden Sixties,\" the second decade that is generally associated with the Japanese economic miracle. In 1965, Japan's nominal GDP was estimated at just over $91 billion. Fifteen years later, in 1980, the nominal GDP had soared to a record $1.065 trillion.\n\nUnder the leadership of Prime Minister Ikeda, former minister of MITI, the Japanese government undertook an ambitious \"income-doubling plan\" (所得倍増). Ikeda lowered interest rates and taxes to private players to motivate spending. In addition, due to the financial flexibility afforded by the FILP, Ikeda's government rapidly expanded government investment in Japan's infrastructure: building highways, high-speed railways, subways, airports, port facilities, and dams. Ikeda's government also expanded government investment in the previously neglected communications sector of the Japanese economy. Each of these acts continued the Japanese trend towards a managed economy that epitomized the mixed economic model.\n\nBesides Ikeda's adherence to government intervention and regulation of the economy, his government pushed trade liberalization. By April 1960, trade imports had been 41 percent liberalized (compared to 22 percent in 1956). Ikeda planned to liberalize trade to 80 percent within three years. His plans however met severe opposition from both industries who had thrived on over-loaning and the nationalist public who feared foreign enterprise takeovers. The Japanese press likened liberalization to \"the second coming of the black ships,\" \"the defenselessness of the Japanese islands in the face of attack from huge foreign capitalist powers,\" and \"the readying of the Japanese economy for a bloodstained battle between national capital and foreign capital.\" Ikeda's income-doubling plan was largely a response to this growing opposition and widespread panic over liberalization, adopted to quell public protests. Ikeda's motivations were purely pragmatic and foreign policy based, however. He moved toward liberalization of trade only after securing a protected market through internal regulations that favored Japanese products and firms.\n\nIkeda also set up numerous allied foreign aid distribution agencies to demonstrate Japan's willingness to participate in the international order and to promote exports. The creation of these agencies not only acted as a small concession to international organizations, but also dissipated some public fears about liberalization of trade. Ikeda furthered Japan's global economic integration by joining the GATT in 1955, the IMF, and the OECD in 1964. By the time Ikeda left office, the GNP was growing at a phenomenal rate of 13.9 percent.\n\nIn 1962, Kaname Akamatsu published his famous article introducing the Flying Geese Paradigm. It postulated that Asian nations will catch up with the West as a part of a regional hierarchy where the production of commoditized goods would continuously move from the more advanced countries to the less advanced ones. The paradigm was named this way due to Akamatsu's envisioning this pattern as geese flying in unison with Japan being an obvious leader.\n\nIn 1973, the first oil-price shock struck Japan (1973 oil crisis). The price of oil increased from 3 dollars per barrel to over 13 dollars per barrel. During this time, Japan's industrial production was decreased by 20%, as the supply capacity could not respond effectively to the rapid expansion of demand, and increased investments in equipment often invited unwanted results—tighter supply and higher prices of commodities. Moreover, the Second Oil Shock in 1978 and 1979 exacerbated the situation as the oil price again increased from 13 dollars per barrel to 39.5 dollars per barrel. Despite being seriously impacted by the two oil crises, Japan was able to withstand the impact and managed to transfer from a product-concentrating to a technology-concentrating production form.\n\nThe transformation was in fact, a product of the oil crises and United States intervention. Since the oil price rose tenfold, the cost of production also soared. After the oil crises, to save costs, Japan had to produce products more environmentally-friendly, and with less oil consumption. The biggest factor that invited industrial changes after the oil crises was the increase in energy prices including crude oil. As a result, Japan converted to a technology-concentrating program, ensuring the steady increase of its economy, and standing out beyond other capitalist countries that had been significantly wounded during the oil crises. Another factor was United States frictions with Japan, as Japan's rapid economic growth could potentially harm the economic interests of the United States. In 1985, the United States signed the \"Plaza Accord\" with Japan, West Germany, France and Britain. The \"Plaza Accord\" was an attempt to devalue the US dollar, yet harmed Japan the most. Japan attempted to expand international markets through the appreciation of the Japanese yen, yet they over-appreciated, creating a bubble economy. The Plaza Accord was successful in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Western European nations but largely failed to fulfill its primary objective of alleviating the trade deficit with Japan.\n\nThe Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) was instrumental in Japan's post-war economic recovery. According to some scholars, no other governmental regulation or organization had more economic impact than MITI. \"The particular speed, form, and consequences of Japanese economic growth,\" Chalmers Johnson writes, \"are not intelligible without reference to the contributions of MITI\" (Johnson, vii). Established in 1949, MITI's role began with the \"Policy Concerning Industrial Rationalization\" (1950) that coordinated efforts by industries to counteract the effects of SCAP's deflationary regulations. In this way, MITI formalized cooperation between the Japanese government and private industry. The extent of the policy was such that if MITI wished to \"double steel production, the neo-\"zaibatsu\" already has the capital, the construction assets, the makers of production machinery, and most of the other necessary factors already available in-house\". The Ministry coordinated various industries, including the emerging \"keiretsu\", toward a specific end, usually toward the intersection of national production goals and private economic interests.\n\nMITI also boosted the industrial security by untying the imports of technology from the imports of other goods. MITI's Foreign Capital Law granted the ministry power to negotiate the price and conditions of technology imports. This element of technological control allowed it to promote industries it deemed promising. The low cost of imported technology allowed for rapid industrial growth. Productivity was greatly improved through new equipment, management, and standardization.\n\nMITI gained the ability to regulate \"all\" imports with the abolition of the Economic Stabilization Board and the Foreign Exchange Control Board in August 1952. Although the Economic Stabilization Board was already dominated by MITI, the Yoshida Governments transformed it into the Economic Deliberation Agency, a mere \"think tank,\" in effect giving MITI full control over all Japanese imports. Power over the foreign exchange budget was also given directly to MITI.\n\nMITI's establishment of the Japan Development Bank also provided the private sector with low-cost capital for long-term growth. The Japan Development Bank introduced access to the Fiscal Investment and Loan Plan, a massive pooling of individual and national savings. At the time FILP controlled four times the savings of the world's largest commercial bank. With this financial power, FILP was able to maintain an abnormally high number of Japanese construction firms (more than twice the number of construction firms of any other nation with a similar GDP).\n\nCoincidentally, the conclusion of the economic miracle coincided with the conclusion of the Cold War. While the Japanese stock market hit its all-time peak at the end of 1989, making a recovery later in 1990, it dropped precipitously in 1991. The year of the conclusion of the Japanese asset price bubble coincided with the Gulf War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n\n"}

The son of Greek immigrants, he was accepted by recruiters only after Greece joined the Allies in late 1940. Following spells with No. 65 Squadron and No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron, he joined No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron in Malta in March 1942. Flying Spitfire Mk Vs, Plagis was part of the multinational group of Allied pilots that successfully defended the strategically important island against numerically superior Axis forces over the next few months. Flying with No. 185 Squadron from early June, he was withdrawn to England in early July 1942.\n\nAfter a spell as an instructor in the UK, Plagis returned to action in September 1943 as commander of No. 64 Squadron, flying Spitfire Mk VCs over northern France. He took command of No. 126 (Persian Gulf) Squadron in June 1944, and led many attacks on German positions during the invasion of France and the campaign that followed; he was shot down over Arnhem during Operation \"Market Garden\", but only lightly wounded. After converting to Mustang IIIs, he commanded a wing based at RAF Bentwaters that supported bombing missions. He finished the war with the rank of squadron leader and remained with the RAF afterwards, operating Gloster Meteors at the head of No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron.\n\nPlagis was the top-scoring Southern Rhodesian ace of the war, and the highest-scoring ace of Greek origin, with 16 confirmed aerial victories, including 11 over Malta. Awarded the Distinguished Service Order and other medals, he was also one of Rhodesia's most decorated veterans. The Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, honoured his wartime contributions by naming a street in its northern Alexandra Park neighbourhood after him. On his return home after retiring from the RAF with the rank of wing commander in 1948, he set up home at 1 John Plagis Avenue, opened a bottle store bearing his name, and was a director of several companies, including Central African Airways in the 1960s. He contested the Salisbury City constituency in the 1962 general election, running for the Rhodesian Front, but failed to win. He died in 1974, reportedly by suicide.\n\nJohn Plagis was born on 10 March 1919 in Gadzema, a mining village near Hartley, about south-west of the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury. His parents, Agorastos and Helen Plagis, were Greek immigrants from the island of Lemnos; he had five siblings. Christened with the Greek name Ioannis Agorastos, Plagis used the English form of Ioannis, John, from childhood, and attended Prince Edward School in Salisbury.\n\nHaving been interested in aviation since he was a boy, Plagis volunteered for the Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was turned down because he was the son of foreign nationals and therefore not a citizen, despite having lived in Rhodesia all his life. After Italy invaded Greece in late October 1940, bringing the Greeks into the war on the Allied side, Plagis applied again—this time to join the Royal Air Force, which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940—and was accepted. Training first in Southern Rhodesia, then England, Plagis passed out with the rank of flight sergeant in June 1941 with above-average ratings in all of his flying assessments.\n\nThough he was officially in the RAF as a Greek (he became a Rhodesian citizen only after the war), Plagis considered himself a Rhodesian flyer and wore shoulder flashes on his uniform denoting him as such. He named each aircraft he piloted during the war after his sister Kay, and painted that name on the side of each cockpit. After briefly flying Spitfires with No. 65 Squadron RAF, Plagis joined No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron, an almost all-Rhodesian Spitfire unit, on 19 July 1941. He served in the UK for about half a year, during which he was commissioned as a pilot officer, before being posted to the Mediterranean theatre in January 1942.\n\nPlagis's first major operation was Operation \"Spotter\", the first of many British endeavours to reinforce the besieged island of Malta in the face of German and Italian assaults during the Battle of the Mediterranean. Malta was considered to be of vital strategic importance, and its defence was looking increasingly precarious in March 1942. \"Spotter\" was a plan to strengthen its British garrison with 16 new Spitfire Mk Vs, which would be carried part of the way from Gibraltar on the aircraft carrier HMS \"Eagle\", then flown to Malta; the pilots would then become part of the severely depleted No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron. The team of pilots comprised eight British airmen, four Australians, two New Zealanders and two Southern Rhodesians—Plagis and his close friend Pilot Officer Doug Leggo.\n\nThe operation, carried out on 7 March 1942, was largely successful and 15 of the 16 Spitfires reached Malta. Plagis and Leggo arrived to find a third Rhodesian, Flight Officer George \"Buck\" Buchanan, already attached to the squadron. A further delivery of 16 Spitfires, Operation \"Picket I\", was attempted on 21 March, but this was less successful; only nine of the planes arrived. Thirteen Spitfire reinforcement operations were ultimately launched between March and October 1942, playing a key role in the siege. The \"Luftwaffe\" and the Italian \"Regia Aeronautica\" meanwhile attempted to bomb Malta into submission, turning the airfields into \"a wilderness of craters, the docks ... a shambles, Valletta a mass of broken limestone ...\"\n\nThe \"Luftwaffe\" launched a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, who had not slept for over 24 hours, returned to the airfield in the early hours having spent the night with a girlfriend. As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly. Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as part of a group of four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him to bale out. Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its slipstream, causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible. In his journal, he vowed to \"shoot down ten for Doug—I will too, if it takes me a lifetime\".\nPlagis shot down his first enemy aircraft on 25 March 1942, and on 1 April achieved four more aerial victories in a single afternoon, thereby becoming the Siege of Malta's first Spitfire ace. His downing of four enemies in a few hours won him much praise from superiors and reporters, and contributed to his growing reputation as an aggressive but skilful combat pilot. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 1 May 1942, the citation noting that he had \"destroyed 4 and probably destroyed a further 3 hostile aircraft\". \"With complete indifference to odds against him, he presses home his attacks with skill and courage,\" it continued—\"He has set an outstanding example.\"\n\nOn 11 May, Plagis attempted to down an Italian Reggiane Re.2001 by flying straight at it to ram it; taking erratic evasive manoeuvres, the Italian aircraft stalled and almost crashed into the sea. Thinking he had downed the enemy, Plagis claimed afterwards to have achieved an aerial victory without firing a shot, but the Italian flight reported no losses. Plagis's Spitfire was lightly hit during this engagement, and the Rhodesian had some luck returning safely; he landed with only three gallons (14 litres) of fuel left. On 16 May, Plagis and an English ace, Pilot Officer Peter Nash, destroyed a Bf 109 for a shared kill that became No. 249 Squadron's 100th victory over Malta. Amid the continuing siege, the need for a major supply convoy to Malta was becoming urgent; the Governor Lord Gort warned Britain in early June that if no supplies came by August, he would have to surrender to prevent a famine.\n\nPlagis was promoted in the field to flight lieutenant on 4 June 1942 and transferred to No. 185 Squadron to command \"B\" Flight. He shot down two Re.2001s two days later to bring his tally of victories to ten (thereby fulfilling his pledge following Leggo's death), and destroyed a Bf 109 on 7 June. A month later, he received a Bar to his DFC, having been adjudged to have shown \"exceptional skill and gallantry in combat ... Undeterred by superior numbers of attacking aircraft, he presses home his attacks with great determination.\" Plagis left Malta when his tour expired on 7 July 1942, flying first to Gibraltar, then the UK. The British finally delivered vital supplies to Malta on 15 August with Operation \"Pedestal\" (known in Malta as the \"Santa Marija Convoy\").\nOn arriving in England, Plagis was found to be suffering from malnutrition, scabies and physical and mental fatigue. He briefly convalesced in a nursing home, then spent a year as an instructor in England. He was promoted to probationary flying officer on 1 October 1942.\n\nPlagis returned to action in September 1943, when he was appointed commanding officer of No. 64 Squadron, then flying Spitfire Mk VCs over northern France from RAF Coltishall in Norfolk. Plagis downed a Bf 109 over France on 24 September 1943, then a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 on 23 November, and formally received the rank of flight lieutenant on 8 December 1943.\n\nAt the start of June 1944, Plagis assumed command of No. 126 (Persian Gulf) Squadron, flying Spitfire Mk IXs that had recently been moved from Malta to assist in the invasion of Normandy. Six of the squadron's planes had been purchased by the Persian Gulf Spitfire Fund, and duly named after the donating sheikdoms; Plagis's aircraft, which he chose because of the large letter \"K\" on its tail (echoing his sister's name), had \"Muscat\" painted in English and Arabic script on its side. He added to this a full rendering of \"Kay\" and other personal decorations.\n\nAfter leading No. 126 Squadron on raids into Normandy during the Allied invasion, Plagis took part in many of the attacks on German positions in northern France and the Low Countries that followed over the next few months. He was shot down over Arnhem in the Netherlands during Operation \"Market Garden\" in September 1944, but suffered only minor injuries and quickly returned to action. He received the Distinguished Service Order on 3 November for his \"participat[ion] in very many sorties during which much damage has been inflicted on ... [German] shipping, radio stations, oil storage tanks, power plants and other installations\". The citation particularly stressed an engagement in which a small group of Allied fighters led by Plagis had taken on a far superior force of enemy aircraft and shot down five of them, Plagis himself downing two. Plagis was described as \"a brave and resourceful leader whose example has proved a rare source of inspiration\".\n\nPlagis converted to Mustang IIIs along with the rest of his squadron at RAF Bentwaters in Suffolk during December 1944 and January 1945, and spent the rest of the war flying bomber escort missions at the head of Bentwaters Wing, which included No. 126 Squadron. He was promoted to squadron leader on 28 March 1945. Germany surrendered on 7 May, ending the war in Europe.\n\nPlagis finished the war with a tally of 16 enemy aircraft confirmed destroyed (including two shared victories counted as half a kill each), two shared probably destroyed, six damaged and one shared damaged. This made him Southern Rhodesia's highest-scoring ace of the war, as well as the top-scoring ace of Greek origin. He was one of the most-decorated Southern Rhodesian servicemen of the war.\n\nPlagis stayed with the RAF following the end of hostilities, and from September 1946 to December 1947 commanded No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron in England and Germany, flying Gloster Meteor F.3s. He was awarded the Airman's Cross by the government of the Netherlands in October 1946. After retiring from the military with the rank of wing commander, Plagis returned home to Southern Rhodesia in 1948. A street in the north Salisbury suburb of Alexandra Park had been named after him in recognition of his wartime exploits; he moved into the house at the end of the road, 1 John Plagis Avenue. He married in 1954 and had three sons and a daughter.\n\nPlagis set up and ran a bottle store bearing his name in Salisbury, and was involved in several businesses during the next three decades, serving as a director on company boards, including Central African Airways from 1963 to 1968. He joined the Rhodesian Front on its formation in 1962, and was its candidate in Salisbury City in that year's general election, losing to the United Federal Party's John Roger Nicholson by 631 votes to 501. According to a report published by the Zimbabwe African National Union in 1969, Plagis was by then working in the office of the Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith (himself a Second World War Spitfire pilot), with responsibility for the premier's written correspondence.\n\nIn later life, Plagis became a friend of British ace Douglas Bader, a prominent supporter of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. Bader, Smith and Plagis often socialised. Plagis also knew L Ron Hubbard, the American founder of Scientology, who briefly relocated to Salisbury in 1966. Hubbard initiated numerous business schemes in Rhodesia, including the purchase of the Bumi Hills Hotel at Kariba. Plagis was one of two local businessmen who partnered with Hubbard in the Bumi Hills deal. He also sold Hubbard an interest in his holdings before the American was deported.\n\nPlagis died in 1974, aged 54 or 55; according to Lauren St John, an author from Gadzema, he had taken his own life, having never truly readjusted to the civilian world.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "756653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=756653", "title": "Kopi Luwak", "text": "Kopi Luwak\n\nKopi luwak (), or civet coffee, is coffee that includes part-digested coffee cherries eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet (\"Paradoxurus hermaphroditus\"). Fermentation occurs as the cherries pass through a civet's intestines, and after being defecated with other fecal matter, they are collected.\n\nProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms, selection – civets choosing to eat only certain cherries – and digestion – biological or chemical mechanisms in the animal's digestive tract altering the composition of the coffee cherries.\n\nThe traditional method of collecting feces from wild civets has given way to intensive farming methods in which civets in battery cage systems are force-fed the cherries. This method of production has raised ethical concerns about the treatment of civets due to \"horrific conditions\" including isolation, poor diet, small cages and a high mortality rate.\n\nAlthough kopi luwak is a form of processing rather than a variety of coffee, it has been called one of the most expensive coffees in the world, with retail prices reaching / per kilogram.\n\nKopi luwak is produced mainly on the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali and Sulawesi in the Indonesian Archipelago. It is also widely gathered in the forest or produced in the farms in the islands of the Philippines (where the product is called \"kape motit\" in the Cordillera region, \"kapé alamíd\" in Tagalog areas, and \"kapé melô\" or \"kapé musang\" in Mindanao island), and in East Timor (where it is called \"kafé-laku\"). \"Weasel coffee\" is a loose English translation of its Vietnamese name \"cà phê Chồn\".\n\nThe origin of kopi luwak is closely connected with the history of coffee production in Indonesia. In the early 18th century the Dutch established the cash-crop coffee plantations in their colony in the Dutch East Indies islands of Java and Sumatra, including Arabica coffee introduced from Yemen. During the era of \"Cultuurstelsel\" (1830–70), the Dutch prohibited the native farmers and plantation workers from picking coffee fruits for their own use. Still, the native farmers wanted to have a taste of the famed coffee beverage. Soon, the natives learned that certain species of \"musang\" or \"luwak\" (Asian palm civet) consumed the coffee fruits, yet they left the coffee seeds undigested in their droppings. The natives collected these luwaks' coffee seed droppings, then cleaned, roasted and ground them to make their own coffee beverage. The fame of aromatic civet coffee spread from locals to Dutch plantation owners and soon became their favourite, yet because of its rarity and unusual process, the civet coffee was expensive even during the colonial era.\n\n\"Kopi\" is the Indonesian word for coffee. \"Luwak\" is a local name of the Asian palm civet in Sumatra. Palm civets are primarily frugivorous, feeding on berries and pulpy fruits such as figs and palms. Civets also eat small vertebrates, insects, ripe fruits and seeds.\n\nProducers of the coffee beans argue that the process may improve coffee through two mechanisms, selection and digestion. Selection occurs as the civets choose which cherries to eat – i.e. those that are most ripe and flawless. Digestive mechanisms may improve the flavor profile of the coffee beans that have been eaten. The civet eats the cherries for the fleshy pulp, then in the digestive tract, fermentation occurs. The civet's protease enzymes seep into the beans, making shorter peptides and more free amino acids.\n\nEarly production began when beans were gathered in the wild from where a civet would defecate as a means to mark its territory. On farms, civets are either caged or allowed to roam within defined boundaries.\n\nCoffee berries are eaten by a civet for their fruit pulp. After spending about a day and a half in the civet's digestive tract the beans are then defecated in clumps, having kept their shape and still covered with some of the fleshy berry's inner layers.\n\nDespite being in contact with faeces and pathogenic organisms, the beans contain negligible amounts of the enteric (pathogenic) organisms associated with feces. Moreover, the \"cherry\" or endocarp surrounding the bean is not completely digested by the luwak, and after being collected, the farmer performs thorough washing and removes the endocarp. The final roasting of the beans would, additionally, eliminate any remaining bacteria.\n\nSumatra is the world's largest regional producer of kopi luwak. Sumatran civet coffee beans are mostly an early arabica variety cultivated in the Indonesian archipelago since the 17th century. The major Sumatran kopi luwak production area is in Lampung, Bengkulu and Aceh especially the Gayo region, Takengon. Tagalog kape alamid comes from civets fed on a mixture of coffee beans and is sold in the Batangas region along with gift shops near airports in the Philippines.\n\nVietnam has two farms with 300 wild civets in Dak Lak, while in Mindanao island of the Philippines, has two farms with 200 (in Davao City) and 100 (Iligan City) wild civets. But the archipelago of Indonesia where the famous \"kopi luwak\" was first discovered and produced is leading in supplying the world market for almost three centuries, where many small-scale civet farms are proliferating in the countryside.\n\nSeveral studies have examined the process in which the animal's stomach acids and enzymes digest the beans' covering and ferment the beans. Research by food scientist Massimo Marcone at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada showed that the civet's endogenous digestive secretions seep into the beans. These secretions carry proteolytic enzymes which break down the beans' proteins, yielding shorter peptides and more free amino acids. The proteins also undergo non-enzymatic Maillard browning reactions in the later roasting process. Moreover, while inside a civet the beans begin to germinate by malting which also lowers their bitterness. Marcone also conducted an analysis on the volatile compounds which are responsible for the coffee's flavour and aroma, showing that there are significant differences from regular coffee. He concluded that: \n\nAccording to Dr. Davila Cortes, the altered protein structure degrades the effectiveness of the coffee as a diuretic.\n\nFew objective assessments of taste are available. Kopi luwak is a name for any beans collected from the excrement of civets, hence the taste may vary with the type and origin of beans ingested, processing subsequent to collection, roasting, aging and brewing. The ability of the civet to select its berries, and other aspects of the civet's diet and health (e.g. stress levels) may also influence the processing and hence taste.\n\nIn the coffee industry, kopi luwak is widely regarded as a gimmick or novelty item. The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA) states that there is a \"general consensus within the industry ... it just tastes bad\". A coffee professional cited in the SCAA article was able to compare the same beans with and without the kopi luwak process using a rigorous coffee cupping evaluation. He concluded: \"it was apparent that Luwak coffee sold for the story, not superior quality...Using the SCAA cupping scale, the Luwak scored two points below the lowest of the other three coffees. It would appear that the Luwak processing diminishes good acidity and flavor and adds smoothness to the body, which is what many people seem to note as a positive to the coffee.”\n\nTim Carman, food writer for the \"Washington Post\" reviewed kopi luwak available to US consumers and concluded \"It tasted just like...Folgers. Stale. Lifeless. Petrified dinosaur droppings steeped in bathtub water. I couldn't finish it.\"\n\nSome critics claim more generally that kopi luwak is simply bad coffee, purchased for novelty rather than taste. Massimo Marcone, who performed extensive chemical tests on the beans, was unable to conclude if anything about their properties made them superior for purposes of making coffee. He employed several professional coffee tasters (called \"cuppers\") in a blind taste test. While the cuppers were able to distinguish the kopi luwak as distinct from the other samples, they had nothing remarkable to appraise about it other than it was less acidic and had less body, tasting \"thin\". Marcone remarked \"It's not that people are after that distinct flavor. They are after the rarity of the coffee\".\n\nSeveral commercial processes attempt to replicate the digestive process of the civets without animal involvement.\n\nResearchers with the University of Florida have been issued with a patent for one such process. Brooklyn-based food startup Afineur has also developed a patented fermentation technology that reproduces some of the taste aspects of Kopi Luwak while improving coffee bean taste and nutritional profile.\n\nVietnamese companies sell an imitation kopi luwak, made using an enzyme soak which they claim replicates the civet's digestive process.\n\nImitation has several motivations. The high price of kopi luwak drives the search for a way to produce kopi luwak in large quantities. Kopi luwak production involves a great deal of labour, whether farmed or wild-gathered. The small production quantity and the labor involved in production contribute to the coffee's high cost. Imitation may be a response to the decrease in the civet population.\n\nInitially, civet coffee beans were picked from wild civet excrement found around coffee plantations. This unusual process contributed to its rarity and subsequently, its high price. More recently, growing numbers of intensive civet \"farms\" have been established and operated across Southeast Asia, confining tens of thousands of animals to live in battery cages and be force-fed. Concerns were raised over the safety of civet coffee after evidence suggested that the SARS virus originated from palm civets.\n\n'\"The conditions are awful, much like battery chickens\", said Chris Shepherd, deputy regional director of the conservation NGO, TRAFFIC south-east Asia. \"The civets are taken from the wild and have to endure horrific conditions. They fight to stay together but they are separated and have to bear a very poor diet in very small cages. There is a high mortality rate and for some species of civet, there's a real conservation risk. It's spiralling out of control. But there's not much public awareness of how it's actually made. People need to be aware that tens of thousands of civets are being kept in these conditions. It would put people off their coffee if they knew\"'.\n\nA 2013 investigation by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Asia found wild-caught civets on farms in Indonesia and the Philippines. The animals were deprived of exercise, a proper diet, and space. Video footage from the investigation shows abnormal behaviours such as repeated pacing, circling, or biting the bars of their cages. The animals often lose their fur. A BBC investigation revealed similar findings.\n\nTony Wild, the coffee executive responsible for bringing kopi luwak to the Western world, has stated he no longer supports using kopi luwak due to animal cruelty and launched a campaign called \"Cut the Crap\" to halt the use of kopi luwak.\n\nFarmers using caged civets in Takengon, north Sumatra, confirmed to the BBC that they supplied kopi luwak beans to exporters whose produce ends up in Europe and Asia.\n\nIntensive farming is also criticised by traditional farmers because the civets do not select what they eat, so the cherries which are fed to them in order to flavor the coffee are of poor quality compared to those beans collected from the wild. According to an officer from the TRAFFIC conservation programme, the trade in civets to make kopi luwak may constitute a significant threat to wild civet populations.\n\nKopi luwak is one of the most expensive coffees in the world, selling for between US$100 and $500 per pound in 2010. The specialty Vietnamese \"weasel coffee\", which is made by collecting coffee beans eaten by wild civets, is sold at US$500 per kilogram. Most customers are Asian, especially those originating from Japan, China and South Korea. Sources vary widely as to annual worldwide production.\n\nThe price of farmed (considered low-grade by connoisseurs) kopi luwak in large Indonesian supermarkets is from US$100 per kilogram (five times the price of a high quality local arabica coffee).\n\nThe price paid to collectors in the Philippines is closer to US$20 per kilogram.\n\nSome specialty coffee shops sell cups of brewed kopi luwak for US$35–80.\n\nInvestigations by PETA and the BBC found fraud to be rife in the kopi luwak industry, with producers willing to label coffee from caged civets with a \"wild sourced\" or similar label.\n\nGenuine kopi luwak from wild civets is difficult to purchase in Indonesia and proving it is not fake is very difficult – there is little enforcement regarding use of the name \"kopi luwak\", and there's even a local cheap coffee brand named \"Luwak\", which costs under US$3 per kilogram but is occasionally sold online under the guise of real kopi luwak.\n\nThere are reports of a kopi luwak type process occurring naturally with muntjac and birds. Bat coffee is another variation that is in demand. Bats feed on the ripest coffee and fruits and spit out the seeds. These seeds are dried and processed to make coffee with a slight fruity flavor.\n\n\n\n"}

The last event took place in 2017.\n\nThe event is one of the largest maritime and aerospace exhibitions in the Asia-Pacific, and is focused mainly on the defence industry, but also supports civilian industries. In 2013, LIMA recorded an overall growth of 10%, with 433 exhibitors from 31 countries, 333 defence delegations from 38 countries, 632 media personnel from 127 agencies, 68 ships and 78 aircraft attending the show. The 5 day event also saw 38,421 trade visitors from both defense and commercial sectors from all around the world, as well as 135,691 public visitors.\n\nThe exhibitors involved in the event exhibit their products inside the purpose built Mahsuri International Exhibition Centre (MIEC), adjacent to the terminal at Langkawi International Airport. The maritime exhibitions take place at Resort World Langkawi while the aerospace exhibitions take place at the Langkawi International Airport. The venues are all in close proximity to each other.\n\nThe event is supported by the Malaysian government and industry associations.\n\nLIMA began in 1991 with slightly over 100 exhibiting companies with the aim of making Langkawi the venue for light and experimental aircraft to fly unhampered by heavy traffic, modeled after the EAA Air Venture in the United States. LIMA has now expanded into maritime exhibitions and is also one of Asia-Pacific's largest maritime and air exhibitions. Nowadays, a four-hour flying display is held daily throughout the show.\n\nThe LIMA '03 exhibition generated business totaling RM 2.182 Billion (USD 575 million) through 30 contracts, letters of offer and acceptance or intent and memorandums of understanding.\n\nLIMA 05' witnessed a signing of RM4 billion worth of contracts in maritime and aerospace items. According to the then Defence Minister Datuk Seri Haji Najib Razak that the amount included defense contract RM3.2 billion, letters of offer worth RM403 million and letters of intent worth RM344 million. Najib Razak said that a major portion of the contracts sealed this time was related to the purchase of A400M aircraft for the Royal Malaysian Air force which amounted to RM2.8 billion including the equipment.\n\nLIMA 07' was the successor to LIMA 05'. The air and maritime exhibition mainly consisted of the same concepts.\n\nThe annual Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace 2013, was launched on 27 March 2013. The show kicked off with a display of air stunts by the Royal Malaysian Air Force. Among the VIPs who were present was Raja Muda of Perlis Tuanku Syed Faizuddin Putra Jamalullail, Raja Puan Muda Tuanku Hajah Lailatul Shahreen Akashah Khalil and their two children.\n\nLIMA 2013 recorded an overall growth of 10%. 433 exhibitors from 31 countries, 333 defence delegations from 38 countries, 632 media personnel from 127 agencies, 68 ships and 78 aircraft attended the show. The 5 day event also saw 38,421 trade visitors from both defense and commercial sectors from all around the world, as well as 135,691 public visitors.\n\nDaily airshows and maritime stunts were staged for visitors. The shows are done by local and foreign army personnel. Vehicles included Zodiac and CB90 boats, Super Lynx and Fennec helicopters. The MMEA showcased its Kilat and Petir boats with their Agusta Westland, Dauphin and Bombardier aircraft.\n\nLIMA 2013 was hoped to be the cleanest exhibition ever as the organizers had hired a firm with 150 workers to conduct the cleaning and waste managing throughout the event.\n\nLIMA 2013 witnessed the signing of 24 contracts that amounted to 4.271 billion, boosting the Malaysian defense technology industry.\n\nThe event was inaugurated on 17 March 2015 and concluded on the 21st. Dassault Aviation had a successful bid, the Malaysian Government expressed interest in buying some of the Dassault Rafale jets.\n\nLIMA 2017 saw over 180,000 visitors, compared to about 175,000 visitors during LIMA 2015, it is expected that there will be a 10% larger crowd during LIMA 2019. LIMA 2017 recorded 555 exhibitors from 36 countries, compared to 512 from 36 countries in LIMA 2015. The value of contracts and agreements signed this time also rose to about RM3.7bil, an increase of 81% from the RM2bil, while 12 memorandums of understanding, 11 contracts, seven letters of agreement and five letters of intent signed were signed.\n\n"}

{"id": "6271027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6271027", "title": "Luchuan–Pingmian campaigns", "text": "Luchuan–Pingmian campaigns\n\nThe Luchuan–Pingmian Campaigns () (1436–49) were punitive expeditions carried out by the Ming dynasty under the rule of the Zhengtong Emperor against the Shan state of Mong Mao, on the Burma-Yunnan frontier.\n\nLuchuan–Pingmian was a Chinese military and civilian pacification commission on the Burmese frontier, corresponding roughly to the modern districts of Longchuan and Ruili, including part of the Gaoligong Mountains, along the upper reaches of the Shweli River.\n\nA year after the Ming–Mong Mao Intervention of 1398, the tusi Si Lunfa died and a new generation of elites rose to power in Mong Mao. His son Si Xingfa, together with Dao Hun and Dao Cuan, conducted short lived raids on Ming territory before military retaliation by the Yunnan guard led a stop to that. The territory of Mong Mao was partitioned into five new administrative divisions each with their own tusi. Thereafter Si Xingfa paid regular annual tribute to the Ming until he was removed from office in 1413 for failing to observe proper tribute ceremonies, and offended an imperial envoy. His brother Si Renfa succeeded him.\n\nIn the following 20 years from 1413 to 1433 Mong Mao, Hsenwi, and the Kingdom of Ava regularly lodged complaints of incursions by neighboring states to the Ming. However no action was taken except to send imperial envoys to persuade them to cease encroachment on foreign territories.\n\nIn March 1436 Si Renfa petitioned for an exemption of 2,500 taels in taxes, which was the amount Mong Mao was in arrears. Emperor Yingzong of Ming granted the petition approval despite objections from his officials.\n\nIn November 1437 Si Renfa attacked the tusi of Nandian and annexed his land. A petition was sent to the Ming court requesting assistance in returning land that had been taken from it by Mong Mao. The regional commander of Yunnan, Mu Sheng, was requested to make an investigation into the matter. His report arrived on 28 June 1438, stating that Mong Mao\nhad \"repeatedly invaded Nandian, Ganyai, Tengchong...Lujiang,\nand Jinchi\". Another report arrived on 14 July, 1438, stating that the Mong Mao ruler had \"appointed local\nchieftains of the neighboring regions subordinate to him without\nasking for the approval of the Ming court and that some of these\nmen joined forces with him to invade Jinchi.\" \n\nIn preparation for a punitive expedition, the Ming court issued an imperial edict to Hsenwi asking for their assistance in surrounding Mong Mao.\n\nThe strategy of divide and conquer had failed on the Yunnan-Burma frontier. Rather than making the Tai and Shan peoples easier to manage, it had balkanized the region and contributed to the endemic chaos and warfare that plagued the various tusis the Ming had created. In 1438 a total of 199 tusi offices were abolished and the regional commander of Yunnan, Mu Sheng, received orders to carry out a punitive campaign on 8 December, 1438.\n\nThe first punitive expedition was led by Fang Zheng, Zhang Rong, Mu Sheng, and Mu Ang.\n\nMu Sheng, Mu Ang, and Fang Zheng reached the garrison town of Jinchi, located east of the Salween River on 8 December 1438. There they encountered Si Renfa's defensed on the opposite side of the river, where palisades had already been erected. Mu Sheng attempted to negotiate Si Renfa's surrender and sent the commander Che Lin to reach a compromise. Si Renfa agreed to the terms, however his general Mianjian attempted to challenge the Ming troops. Seeing that Mu Sheng had no intention to fight, the exasperated Fang Zheng took his troops as well as his son Fang Ying across the river at night and defeated the enemy, forcing them to retreat. Si Renfa retreated to Jinghan stockade while his forces fled as far as the Gaoligong Mountains.\n\nOn 17 January 1439, Fang Zheng attacked Si Renfa's stockade and forced him to retreat further south, after which he continued in pursuit. However by this time his troops were exhausted and his supply lines were cut off. He requested reinforcements but Mu Sheng only sent a small number as he was angry that Fang Zheng had disobeyed orders. Fang Zheng was then defeated at Kongni where he had pursued Si Renfa, and \"fell into an ambush of the elephant phalanx of his enemy\", at which point he ordered his son to escape, and died with his troops. \n\nUpon receiving news of Fang Zheng's defeat, Mu Sheng dismantled his camps and retreated to Baoshan as late spring was approaching and along with it the hot summer. When Mu Sheng reached Chuxiong City, he was reprimanded by an imperial envoy for Fang Zheng's failure. Fearing that the emperor would blame him for the loss at Kongni, Mu Sheng sent back 45,000 troops, but died soon after from an illness on 2 May 1439. Emboldened by the Ming failure to suppress him, Si Renfa continued his military expansion against his neighbors.\n\nIn December 1440 Mu Ang petitioned for a second campaign involving at least a combined army of 120,000 men from Huguang, Sichuan, and Guizhou. The Vice Minister of Justice, He Wenyuan, was against a second campaign and petitioned the court on 7 February 1441, in an attempt to persuade them not to squander their resources in capturing land that is \"not inhabitable to us.\" The war party, led by the Minister of War, Wang Ji, and the Duke of Yingguo, Zhang Fu, argued that to let Si Renfa do as he pleased would show weakness to the neighboring Hsenwi and Ava, and would result in a loss of prestige and encourage further rebellions. The second campaign was authorized by the young Zhengtong Emperor under the influence of the palace eunuch Wang Zhen.\n\nThe second expedition was led by Jiang Gui, Li An, Liu Ju, and Wang Ji. Before the expedition was carried out,Liu Qiu, a member of the Hanlin Academy as well as an imperial tutor, presented a memorial in opposition of the campaign. Liu Qiu argued that the southern rebels had already retreated into hiding in the southernmost zone of Yunnan, and did not warrant such a large expenditure as mobilizing 150,000 men. Wang Zhen had him arrested and executed by dismemberment. The second Ming campaign to the Yunnan frontier was officially launched on 27 February 1441.\n\nIn June 1441 a Ming contingent of 8,000 engaged with a small Mong Mao party and defeated them in battle, inflicting 150 casualties.\n\nIn September 1441 the Ming army met with a Mong Mao force of 30,000 and 80 elephants. The Mong Mao advance was repelled, suffering 352 casualties.\n\nIn November 1441 a Ming army of 20,000 was ambushed by Si Renfa. However the ambush was unsuccessful and Si Renfa was forced to retreat with 1,000 casualties. The Ming army pursued the defeated Shan forces to their stronghold in Shangjiang and besieged them. When the Ming set fire to their stockades, Si Renfa's forces attempted to escape through a watergate, but were attacked by the Ming, and suffered heavy casualties. Although Si Renfa managed to escape, his side reportedly suffered 50,000 casualties in total.\n\nIn December 1441 a Ming contingent of 8,000 engaged in battle with an armed Mong Mao force of 20,000 and defeated them.\n\nIn January 1442 the Ming army finally attacked Si Renfa's base and captured it. The defending garrison was said to have suffered 2,390 casualties.\n\nSi Renfa fled to Ava where he was arrested by the king and held for ransom in return for Ming land, however the Ming were reluctant to deal with Ava.\n\nSi Renfa's son Si Jifa escaped and continued independent action in another corner of southwest Yunnan. He sent his younger brother Zhaosai to seek pardon from Ming while at the same time he attacked Ming troops in early 1443. However they were defeated and he was forced to flee to Mong Yang. Zhaosai was kept as a hostage and the Ming retreated from Mong Mao. Seeing that Mong Mao was no longer occupied, Si Jifa returned to his father's base of power and began attacking neighboring tribes once again.\n\nThe third punitive expedition was led by Wang Ji and launched in March 1443. Although the mission was to capture Si Jifa, negotiations on the return of Si Renfa had fallen ill. Ava demanded Ming territory for itself and Hsenwi in return of Si Renfa. Furthermore Ava had made peace with Si Jifa. Therefore, although the Ming army quickly defeated Si Jifa's base of power and captured his family, Si Jifa managed to escape to Mong Yang, and the Ming army decided not to pursue out of consideration of a combined Ava-Hsenwi attack on Ming forces.\n\nA compromise was finally reached between Ava and Ming in April 1445. Ava agreed to hand over Si Renfa in return for Ming support in annexing part of Hsenwi's territory. Si Renfa came into Ming custody in August 1445 and was executed in January 1446.\n\nSince 1444 Si Jifa had repeatedly sent tribute to Ming asking for pardon to no avail. \n\nIn March 1449, a combined army of 150,000 soldiers was amassed, and the fourth and final campaign to extirpate the Mong Mao threat was launched under the supervision of Wang Ji.\n\nThe army quickly marched on Mong Yang, which harbored Si Jifa, and captured their strongholds. However Si Jifa managed to escape yet again, and the campaign ended inconclusively with the ruling Shan elite allowed to remain in Mong Yang so long as they never returned to Mong Mao. Sources disagree as to how Si Jifa met his end. One source claims he died in combat in 1449, another says he was captured by the king of Ava and held captive in exchange for Ming territory, and one Shan chronicle claims he reigned for another fifty years. While Mong Mao had been defeated and pacified, Si Jifa's son Si Hongfa continued to rule in Mong Yang and his successors would eventually go on to invade Ava in 1527. So in practice Si Lunfa's family survived as rulers in the neighboring state of Mong Yang under the close observation of Ming.\n\nThe fourth campaign was also marred by lack of discipline, inefficient administration, and mismanagement of resources. On the first day of mobilization, the entire 150,000 strong army started marching all at once, and many were trampled to death. Food supplies were mismanaged and assigned to individual carriers disproportionate to their weight, and no proper plan for their distribution existed. Some soldiers committed suicide due to the conditions prevalent in the army.\n\nAs the historian Wang Gongwu observes:\n\nThe four southern punitive expedition and the capture of the Zhengtong Emperor during the following Tumu Crisis are considered the turning point into decline for the Ming dynasty.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1730537", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1730537", "title": "March equinox", "text": "March equinox\n\nThe March equinox or Northward equinox is the equinox on the Earth when the subsolar point appears to leave the Southern Hemisphere and cross the celestial equator, heading northward as seen from Earth. The March equinox is known as the vernal equinox in the Northern Hemisphere and as the autumnal equinox in the Southern.\n\nOn the Gregorian calendar, the Northward equinox can occur as early as 19 March or as late as 21 March. For a common year the computed time slippage is about 5 hours 49 minutes \"later\" than the previous year, and for a leap year about 18 hours 11 minutes \"earlier\" than the previous year. Balancing the increases of the common years against the losses of the leap years keeps the calendar date of the March equinox from drifting more than one day from 20 March each year.\n\nThe March equinox may be taken to mark the beginning of spring and the end of winter in the Northern Hemisphere but marks the beginning of autumn and the end of summer in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nIn astronomy, the March equinox is the zero point of sidereal time and, consequently, right ascension. It also serves as a reference for calendars and celebrations in many human cultures and religions.\nThe point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator northwards is called the First Point of Aries. However, due to the precession of the equinoxes, this point is no longer in the constellation Aries, but rather in Pisces. By the year 2600 it will be in Aquarius. The Earth's axis causes the First Point of Aries to travel westwards across the sky at a rate of roughly one degree every 72 years. Based on the modern constellation boundaries, the northward equinox passed from Taurus into Aries in the year −1865 (1866 BC), passed into Pisces in the year −67 (68 BC), will pass into Aquarius in the year 2597, and will pass into Capricornus in the year 4312. It passed by (but not into) a 'corner' of Cetus at 0°10′ distance in the year 1489.\n\nIn its apparent motion on the day of an equinox, the Sun's disk crosses the Earth's horizon directly to the east at dawn—rising; and again, some 12 hours later, directly to the west at dusk—setting. The March equinox, like all equinoxes, is characterized by having an almost exactly equal amount of daylight and night across most latitudes on Earth.\n\nDue to refraction of light rays in the Earth's atmosphere the Sun will be visible above the horizon even when its disc is completely below the limb of the Earth. Additionally, when seen from the Earth, the Sun is a bright disc in the sky and not just a point of light, thus sunrise and sunset can be said to start several minutes before the sun's geometric center even crosses the horizon, and extends equally long after. These conditions produce differentials of actual durations of light and darkness at various locations on Earth during an equinox. This is most notable at the more extreme latitudes, where the Sun may be seen to travel sideways considerably during the dawn and evening, drawing out the transition from day to night. At the north and south poles, the Sun appears to move steadily around the horizon, and just above the horizon, neither rising nor setting apart from a slight change in declination of about 0.39° per day as the equinox passes.\n\nThe Babylonian calendar began with the first full moon after the vernal equinox, the day after the Sumerian goddess Inanna's return from the underworld (later known as Ishtar), in the Akitu ceremony, with parades through the Ishtar Gate to the Eanna temple, and the ritual re-enactment of the marriage to Tammuz, or Sumerian Dummuzi.\n\nThe Persian calendar begins each year at the northward equinox, observationally determined at Tehran.\n\nThe Indian national calendar starts the year on the day next to the vernal equinox on 22 March (21 March in leap years) with a 30-day month (31 days in leap years), then has 5 months of 31 days followed by 6 months of 30 days.\n\nThe Julian calendar reform lengthened seven months and replaced the intercalary month with an intercalary day to be added every four years to February. It was based on a length for the year of 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 d), while the mean tropical year is about 11 minutes and 15 seconds less than that. This had the effect of adding about three quarters of an hour every four years. The effect accumulated from inception in 45 BC until the 16th century, when the northern vernal equinox fell on 10 or 11 March.\n\nThe date in 1452 was 11 March, 11:52 (Julian) \nIn 2547 it will be 20 March, 21:18 (Gregorian) and 3 March, 21:18 (Julian).\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the sidereal solar calendar, celebrations which originally coincided with the vernal equinox now take place throughout South Asia and parts of Southeast Asia on the day when the Sun enters the sidereal Aries, generally around 14 April.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Many Russian, Ukrainian, German, French, Italian, drama, opera and оperetta companies performed on its stage among which Sarah Bernhardt, Eleonora Duse, Benoît-Constant Coquelin, Jean Mounet-Sully, Maria Savina, Vladimir Davydov, Maria Zankovetskaya, Panas Saksagansky and Mark Kropivnitsky.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, the “State Odessa Russian Drama Theatre” was officially registered in 1926 and the building was allocated to this government owned entity. In 1927, the Executive Political Committee of the Odessa Governorate (Gubispolkom) appointed opera singer Andrei Alekseyevich Ivanov as director of the theatre. Today the theatre is also called the Ivanov Theatre. Important actors started their activity at the Odessa Russian Theatre, among which Mikhail Astangov, Darya Zerkalova and Vladimir Samoilov. Among the actors which spent most of their acting activity on the theatre’s stage are Nikolai Komissarov, Nikolai Volkov the elder, Liya Bugova, Pavel Mikhaylov, Boris Zaydenberg, Leonid Marennikova, Yevgeny Kotov, Lidiya Polyakova and Igor Shelyugin. Important Russian and Ukrainian directors mounted productions at the Odessa Russian Theatre, among which: Abram Rubin, Alexey Gripich, Аvraam Teplev, Aleksandr Solomarsky, Vladimir Bortko the elder, Viktor Terentyev, Konstantin Chernyadev, Viktor Strizhov, Eduard Mitnitsky, Aleksandr Dzekun and many other things\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, the theatre maintained its status as Russian-language theatre. Being closed for renovation for about two years, the theatre opened in 2003 after extensive reconstruction and major overhaul. A team of young actors has been hired, which interact with well-known visiting actors. An art management of theatre is coordinated by a board consisting of three directors. At present, these positions are held by Alexey Girba, Sergey Golomazov and Alexey Litvin.\n\nIn December 2009, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Ukraine awarded the Odessa regional Russian drama theatre the rank of academic theatre. In the Soviet Union and the new states created after the collapse of the Soviet Union, this title is awarded to the theatres considered to be most prestigious in the country.\n\n"}

Moira Donegan, a former assistant editor at \"The New Republic\", initially began the spreadsheet online anonymously.\n\nIn October 2017, Donegan posted the spreadsheet, which allowed anonymous contributions to supplement existing \"whisper networks\" about allegations of sexual harassment and violence in the media industry. The list—in the form of a shared Google spreadsheet—was active for around 12 hours, during which time it quickly went viral within media circles. Upon learning that BuzzFeed intended to publish an article about it, Donegan took it down.\n\nOn October 16, 2017, alt-right social media personality Mike Cernovich tweeted that he was willing to pay $10,000 for a copy of the list. Cernovich later said that a source sent him the list but \"…was insistent on not accepting anything.\" On October 21, Cernovich promised to publish the listed names, but after identifying two journalists he consulted his lawyer and held back the rest.\n\nOn October 25, 2017—after obtaining a copy of the list—\"Politico\" contacted several publications with writers on the list. \"The New York Times\" explained that since there had been no internal complaints connected to people on the list, there were no investigations. \"New York\" magazine's publisher, New York Media, said that in the case of its employees on the list, \"We have reviewed whether any type of action is appropriate and have acted accordingly. It is New York Media's policy not to disclose publicly any findings or actions taken as a result of this process so as to preserve the confidential and sensitive nature of these matters.\" As for BuzzFeed writers on the list, one staffer said the names weren't a total surprise to many, and that the reputations of those men preceded them.\n\nThe list also contained the names of multiple employees at \"The New Republic\" and \"The New Yorker\" who had multiple accusations levied against them as indicated by their entries in the list being highlighted in red. \nAs Vox pointed out \"…none of the men who appear on the Shitty Media Men list, even those who were accused of multiple counts of rape, have faced criminal charges.\"\n\nOn October 27, 2017, \"The Atlantic\" terminated the employment of prominent editor Leon Wieseltier, who was among those named in the list, due to allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nIn November 2017, BuzzFeed began an investigation of employees from their staff named on the list, including its White House correspondent, Adrian Carrasquillo. In December 2017—following a new complaint of inappropriate comments sent to a coworker—Carrasquillo was fired by BuzzFeed for violating their code of conduct.\n\nOn December 6, 2017, Lorin Stein, editor of \"The Paris Review\", resigned amid an internal investigation into his behavior toward female employees and writers. He had informed board members that his name was on the list of anonymous allegations of harassment and misconduct by men in publishing and media. He also resigned as editor at large of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.\n\nIn January 2018, while the list was still being discussed in the media, it was rumored that \"Harper's\" planned to publish the name of the list's creator in an article written by Katie Roiphe, which elicited concern of doxing—and the general safety—of the list's creator. The rumors prompted Moira Donegan to preemptively come forward as the list's creator.\n\nOn 10 October 2018, Stephen Elliott, a writer based in New Orleans, and founder of the literary site the Rumpus, filed a federal lawsuit in the Eastern District of New York against \"Moira Donegan and Jane Does (1-30)\" seeking $1.5 million in damages. Donegan is represented by Robbie Kaplan, a co-founder of the Time's Up Legal Defense Fund and Elliott is represented by Andrew Miltenberg, a high-profile sexual assault defense attorney. Elliott's lawsuit seeks to make public the identities of those who contributed to the crowd-sourced Google spreadsheet.\n\nGoogle reportedly told The Daily Beast that it would \"oppose any attempt by Mr. Elliott to obtain information about this document from us.\"\n\nIn an essay titled \"We stand with Moira Donegan\" at the Rumpus, which Elliott founded, the site's current owner and editor in chief Marisa Siegel wrote, \"Stephen's decision to go after Moira is hostile and reprehensible. For me, it is unforgivable. ... Stephen's desire to remain in the spotlight, to refuse to have his career wrested from him as a consequence of his own actions, has taken primacy over logic and sanity.\"\n"}

Burriana was an important Muslim city, being the capital of La Plana, Valencia. It was known as the \"Green City\". The city was besieged for two months, finally falling to the forces of James I in July 1233.\n\nIn 1229, the city of Valencia, known to the Muslims as \"Balansiya\", had fallen to the forces under the command of Zayyan ibn Mardanish, a local leader who was opposed to the Almohades. In capturing that city, he dethroned Zayd Abu Zayd, who subsequently fled to the Kingdom of Aragon. James I of Aragon used this as a casus belli to intervene in the Muslim civil war on the side of the Almohades, but in reality with the pretext of expanding his own territory.\n\nTwo Aragonese knights, Hugo de Follalquer, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, and Blas de Aragón, who had just returned from a period of exile in Valencia, met with Jaime I at Alcañiz. They recounted stories of the prosperity of the Muslim kingdom and encouraged the king to conquer it in 1233.\n\nAfter taking Burriana, the castles to the north continued to fall into Aragonese hands one by one including; Peniscola, Castelló de la Plana, Borriol, Cuevas de Vinromá and Villafamés.

{"id": "41415987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41415987", "title": "The Theatre, Leeds", "text": "The Theatre, Leeds\n\nThe Theatre in Hunslet, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, was a theatre for summer shows, built in 1771 by Tate Wilkinson and redeveloped in 1867. Mrs Siddons and Ching Lau Lauro appeared here in 1786 and 1834 respectively. It was the only drama theatre in Leeds until 1864, after which business was challenged by competition. It became shabby and was partially rebuilt in 1867 to create the smarter Royal Theatre, which was to burn down in 1875. No theatre was built again on this site, and its surviving Victorian successors are the Leeds City Varieties of 1865 and the Grand Theatre of 1878.\n\nThe Theatre of 1771 was a fairly basic brick building of . It was on the east side of Meadow Lane, Hunslet, Leeds, near Leeds Bridge. In his \"Memoirs\" of 1790, Tate Wilkinson described it as \"quite a palace.\" However \"The Leeds Guide\" of 1806 despaired of it: \"Its form inconvenient, and utterly unworthy of the populous and flourishing town to which it belongs.\" By 1867 it was remembered as a \"dingy little theatre\" and a \"barn out of repair,\" although it hosted fine plays. It had a vestibule, gallery, boxes and pit, and an audience of 600 could be crammed in, but the stage and auditorium were the same size. It was said by the actress Dorothea Jordan that the green room \"was miserable and cold, half the upper part of it admitting the wind and the rain,\" although advertisements in the \"Leeds Intelligencer\" said the stage was \"elegantly illuminated by wax candles.\" The New Theatre Royal and Opera House of 1867 had grander pretensions, having all facilities.\n\nThe Theatre was built in 1771 by actor-manager Tate Wilkinson (1739–1803). It was part of his repertory company's York Theatre Circuit which included York, Doncaster, Halifax, Hull, Leeds, Pontefract, and Wakefield. These theatres were built to Wilkinson's order from 1768 to 1803. There followed various other managers, including his son John. Sometime after 1834 its name was changed to the Theatre Royal, not to be confused with the Royal Theatre which was a later development of the same building. Business was difficult due to the small size of the theatre, its poor condition, its inconvenient location away from the city centre and the heavy industry surrounding the site.\n\nEncouraged by the new railways which gave opportunity for a northern theatre circuit, the actor John Coleman bought the theatre in 1863. It was successful until 1864, when the new Amphitheatre was built in Lands Lane. Coleman responded by refurbishing the interior. It was successful, but not enough for Coleman, who attempted and failed to purchase land to build another city-centre theatre.\n\nColeman developed the New Royal Theatre and Opera House (later the Royal Theatre) from the remains of the partly demolished Theatre Royal (previously The Theatre) in 1867. \"Johnson's New Guide to Leeds\" was happy with this building; it was \"replete with every modern appliance, both before and behind the curtain.\" It had a simple frontage \"of the Italian Style,\" and the \"Leeds Times\" described it thus: The box entrance is the central avenue; the foyer is lofty, spacious and well-lighted; the floor is inlaid with tesselated tiles; there is a large and handsome fireplace, with a radiating hearth-stove ... and over the magnificent marble mantelpiece is a large mirror; whilst exquisite statues line the niches on either hand. A large stone staircase leads to the grand tier. The ladies' saloon is a perfect boudoir, for here are ranged round luxurious settees of maplewood covered with silk velvet. Abutting upon the saloon is the lavatory, which is replete with every comfort and convenience requisite for a public place of amusement. Immediately adjacent are the gentlemen's saloons, coffee rooms etc., which are to be fitted up in a very elegant manner. The dress circle is estimated to seat one hundred, and the balcony one hundred persons; there are twenty private boxes, each of which will accommodate eight visitors, and these are provided with settees of silk velvet with spring cushions ... The pit is approached by a long and spacious corridor, and will provide ample accommodation for nearly eleven hundred spectators. The entrance to the gallery is from the back of the theatre, through Waterloo Street, and in this part of the house, seats have been provided for upwards of eleven hundred people ... The staircases are of stone, and, in the event of an alarm of fire ever taking place, there are several exits, so that the building can be cleared in an inconceivably short time. Every convenience has been provided for the accommodation of the visitors to the pit and gallery, each of which have their separate saloons, coffee-rooms etc.\n\nThe decorations which are carried out by Mr Andrew Jackson, are of the most artistic and \"recherche\" description, Mr Coleman having been fortunate as to obtain them from designs of the decorations of the Palace of Versailles. The designs in terracotta, and the elaborate proscenium, are from the studio of Mr Walker, of this town. Messrs Singleton and Tennant have provided all the ornamental and other ironwork; the plumbers' work has been executed by Messrs Lindley and Johnson. Many other contracts have been carried out by other tradesmen in the town, and the whole building has been erected by Messrs Nicholson & Son, under the personal superintendence of the architect Thomas Angelo Moore, (of Thomas Moore & Son, Sunderland) . . .\n\nComplete as the building is in front, behind the stage it is really wonderful. There are upwards of twenty dressing and retiring rooms, in each of which hot and cold water has been laid on. The stage is simply marvellous. Every square inch of it takes up like the pieces of a child's puzzle. There are traps, slides, slotes, scruter work, counterweights and scores of other complicated arrangements which we do not understand, and cannot therefore attempt to describe. Suffice it that Mr Huby, the clever machinist, who has invented the stage, alleges that he can either draw up or sink down pieces of scenery thirty feet wide and thirty feet high. Hence, in pantomime time, we may expect to see groups of fairies floating about in mid air, descending from the heights above, or ascending from the abyss beneath. To add to effects of this kind, a magnificent gas apparatus has been laid on by Mr Smith, the celebrated gas engineer, from Birmingham, in addition to which an illuminating machine has been obtained in the shape of a new limelight apparatus, by means of which upwards of thirty different colours of lights can be thrown upon the stage at one time. Above the whole of the machinery is the lofty and commodious carpenter's shop. Over the roof of the pit, the large property store-room, and immediately adjacent the painting-room, which is, without exception, the very best we have ever seen; we doubt whether any metropolitan theatre has one equal to it. \"\"\n\nHowever on 28 May 1875 the Royal Theatre was destroyed by fire, and it was never rebuilt.Destruction of the Theatre Royal, Leeds\n\nThe Theatre Royal, Leeds, the property of J. Coleman, was last night completely destroyed by fire. Fortunately the performance last night had been concluded, and the large audience had been dispersed scarcely five minutes before the fire was discovered. About twenty minutes to eleven flames were suddenly seen issuing from the high building forming the stage portion of the theatre. An alarm was at once given, and in a short time the fire brigade from the Town Hall and the fire brigades connected with the insurance offices were on the spot.\n\nMeanwhile the flames had burst forth in the most alarming manner, threatening destruction not only to the theatre itself, but to the thickly clustered dwelling-houses in the adjoining courts. The hose connected with the theatre had been brought into use immediately on the fire being discovered, but those using it were soon compelled to retreat to the outside of the building. Burning scenery and timber rained down upon the stage, and soon filled the spacious auditorium with suffocating fumes. Some minutes before the arrival of any of the brigades, the flames, bursting through the roof, shot in terrible grandeur into the sky. The public-houses and other places of resort were just at this time closing, and in a few minutes Briggate, Leeds Bridge, and the narrow streets converging upon Hunslet Lane, in the vicinity of the theatre, were crowded with many thousands of spectators. It was obvious from the first that the entire structure was doomed. Showers of sparks falling upon the roof of the auditorium soon set fire to this portion of the premises. Slight as the wind was, it was sufficient to fan the flames, travelling in the direction of the principal entrance in Hunslet Lane. Within an hour from the discovery of the first outbreak the entire building was one mass of flame.\n\nSeeing the utter hopelessness of attempting to save anything within the theatre itself (some loose properties in the front hall appeared to be all that was recovered) Mr Henderson, the chief constable, and Mr Baker, the superintendent of the Corporation Fire Brigade, wisely concentrated their efforts upon protecting the neighbouring property. By twelve o'clock the flames seemed to have exhausted all that was really in the theatre. The damage, at a rough estimate by Mr Coleman, the lessee, is said to amount to between £30,000 and £35,000. This is partially covered by insurance spread over a number of offices. Seven or eight years ago the theatre, which was originally opened in 1771, was partially rebuilt, considerably enlarged, and generally improved. The scenery, dresses, and property are described as having been exceedingly valuable. All are destroyed. In addition to the scenery and dresses required in the representation of \"The Two Orphans\", there was an accumulation of the most valuable scenery, which had been painted as the requirements of different seasons called for it by the most eminent scenic artists. These it will be impossible to replace.\n\nAs to the origin of the fire, the accounts of some of those who were in the building at the time when the flames were first discovered seem to point to the property room. The fire originated in the neighbourhood of the \"flys\" or immediately above them, all concur in stating; and also that the first intimation of the fire was the falling onto the stage of portions of scenery, the upper parts of which were in flames. The actors and actresses and others who were engaged at the theatre lose the whole of their properties, which they had left in the building at the conclusion of last night's performance.\"\"\n\nThe site is now empty except for a bus shelter and trees.\n\nThe Theatre was not a full-time theatre. Opening hours were six to seven pm, usually in May to July only, with three or four performances per week. This arrangement filled the gap while London theatres closed in summer, and famous actors could appear here, for example Sarah Siddons in 1786. Comic operas, adapted versions of Shakespeare's plays and pantomime were presented here. Often there were two dramas per night with singing or dancing in the interval. After John Coleman took over in 1863, his own company and touring companies were performing here, and he presented new dramas. The management attempted to increase income by letting in the poorer members of the public for half-price during the third act, but this caused disturbance and complaints. The New Royal Theatre opened every evening, hosting touring companies and putting on Christmas pantomimes.\n\nThe very first play at The Theatre was \"A Word to the Wise\" by Hugh Kelly on 24 May 1771.On Wednesday last was open'd in this town, the new Theatre, with the Comedy of \"A Word to the Wise\", to a numerous and polite audience, who express'd the greatest satisfaction at the moral tendency of the piece, and the merit of the performers. Mr Wilkinson (proprietor of the new Theatre in this town) has subscribed four guineas annually, to the General Infirmary.\"\"On June 20th 1817 during the performance of The Tragedy of Jane Shore by Nicholas Rowe leading actor Mr Cummins died during the performance. Playing the part of Dumont he fell down on stage and instantly expired of ossification of the heart. The performance was of course terminated at this point.\n\nOn 15–19, 22 and 23 September 1834, Ching Lau Lauro played here. Over this period he presented his ventriloquism, a piece called \"Seraglio\" and some new \"Surprising Feats.\" alongside various plays. The melodrama version of \"It Is Never Too Late to Mend\" was presented in February 1865 to great acclaim.\n\n"}

Later, the sow gives birth to a litter of piglets. The man attempts to spoon-feed milk to the piglets, but the piglets prefer to drink directly from the milk bowl. In general, the piglets prefer their mother's company, repeatedly scorning the man's advances. Taking this rejection as an unforgivable personal slight, the man hangs the piglets and leaves their bodies strung up in the open. When the sow discovers the remains of the piglets, she runs madly around the farm squealing. The sow slips into a deep patch in the mud and drowns there.\n\nThe man searches for the sow, and becomes visibly distraught when he discovers her dead. He drags the body from the mud, buries it on the farm grounds, and crudely attempts to bury himself on a patch of ground nearby. He gets up, and his grief turns to rage. He rushes around the farm scattering and smashing his belongings from the house, including his jars of waste. \n\nHe prepares and vigorously consumes a \"tea\" made of feces and urine, determinedly climbs a ladder in the barn and hangs himself with a rope. In the final scene is his spirit floating skyward.\n\n\nBetter known by the English title Wedding Trough, the film has never had an official theater release, but has been shown in film festivals around the world, notably at the Perth International Film Festival in 1975, with the screening upsetting Australian censors. \n\nBecause there was no official theatrical, VHS, or until recently DVD release, \"Wedding Trough\" is one of the most obscure movies that is not a lost film. \n\nIts last film festival appearance was at the 61st Locarno International Film Festival in \"Tribute to the Royal Belgian Cinémathèque / Experimental film Competitions of Knokke le Zoute\".\n\nGerman video distributor Camera Obscura and Swedish distributor Njuta Films each released the film on DVD.\n\nIn Australia, the Perth International Film Festival scheduled a screening of \"Vase de Noces\" in 1975. At the time, film festival submissions did not require approval from Australian censors, however the Western Australian government pressured censors to review the film before the screening. The censors did so, and subsequently refused to classify the film on grounds of obscenity. Festival chairman David Roe and director Thierry Zéno appealed to the censors to reconsider. Their appeal was successful, and the film was shown in the festival after all. The Western Australian Government was not happy that the festival went ahead with the screening, and this incident created a precedent for animosity between the two groups for years to come.\n\nThe government of Western Australian urged the Perth Film Festival to discontinue their plans to screen Nagisa Oshima's \"In the Realm of the Senses\", threatening that future festivals would be subject to thorough censorial review in advance, if they went ahead with the screening. As a result of this pressure, the Perth Film Festival decided not to screen Oshima's film. Film festivals in Melbourne and Sydney went on to screen \"In the Realm of the Senses\" without incident. On December 17, 1976, \"Vase de Noces\" went before the Australian censors again, and again received a judgment of \"refused classification\". A third such attempt was made a third time on April 1, 1977. But, the Australian censors rejected the film once again, effectively banning its reproduction and dissemination throughout Australia. This ruling has not been successfully appealed.\n\n"}

{"id": "2226256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226256", "title": "World Scrabble Championship", "text": "World Scrabble Championship\n\nThe World Scrabble Championship (WSC) is the most-prestigious title in competitive English-language Scrabble. It was held every second year after 1991 until 2013 when it began to be held annually. It has been an open event since 2014. Although the official brand name and organizations of the event have changed over recent years, many Scrabble enthusiasts from more than 30 countries compete to become World Scrabble Champion. The reigning World Scrabble Champion is Nigel Richards, who won his fourth title at the 2018 Mattel World Scrabble Championships by winning the final in London in 2018.\n\nSponsorship of the World Scrabble Championship (WSC) formerly alternated between Hasbro and Mattel, the North American and global owners of the Scrabble trademark, respectively. However, after Hasbro declined to sponsor WSC 2005, Mattel has organized and sponsored all championships. Mind Sports International (MSI) began sponsoring the event in 2013 after successfully organizing their own major Scrabble tournament in Prague in 2012. As of 2018, it is now sponsored by Mindsports Academy.\n\nThe number of players competing in the tournament has risen steadily over time, from 48 in 1991 to 108 in 2009. Each country is allocated seats for the championship, and individual countries' national associations determine which of their players represent them. This is typically done by means of a national rating system or qualifier tournaments. A good performance by a national team according to specific criteria will earn further permanent places for that country.\n\nThe official dictionary, used in the majority of English-language Scrabble-playing countries and colloquially known as SOWPODS (an anagram of OSPD and OSW), was used until 2007. It is a combination of two dictionaries: OSPD (Official Scrabble Players Dictionary), published in the US, and OSW (Official Scrabble Words), published in the UK. Local tournaments used only their respective dictionary for the tournament, and each contains words chiefly used and spelled in US English and UK English. Since 2007, Collins supplies the only dictionary used in the WSC, Collins Scrabble Words, which is published in the UK. It was updated on 21 May, 2015 before later being approved by the World English-Language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA) for tournaments on 1 September.\n\nOn May 17, 2013, Mattel announced that the event would be renamed the Scrabble Champions Tournament, and the tournament would be held annually as part of Mind Sports International's Prague Mind Sports Festival. MSI introduced a 'Last Chance Qualifier' tournament, giving players a last opportunity to qualify for 5 places in the main event if they failed to achieve a place on their national team.\n\nIn 2014 the Scrabble Champions Tournament continued in London, but it became an open event, with all players invited to compete.\n\nIn 2015 Mattel and MSI agreed to allow WESPA to organize their own traditional unofficial World Championship, branded the WESPA Championship (WESPAC). It was held in Perth, Australia and followed the invitational format of earlier WSCs. 130 players qualified to play. Wellington Jighere of Nigeria emerged as WESPA Champion after beating Lewis Mackay 4–0 in the final.\n\nIn 2016, the tournament was branded as the MSI World Championships and was split into two divisions based on players' rankings. MSI also hosted world championships in other languages, including French, German, Spanish and Catalan, alongside the French Duplicate Championship.\n\nThe 2017 MSI World Championships were to be held in Doha, Qatar in August 2017, but on 13 June it was announced that the tournament was to be relocated to Nottingham, United Kingdom. It was also split into two divisions based on players' rankings. The second WESPA Championships (first held in 2015) were held in Nairobi, Kenya in November and won by Akshay Bhandarkar.\n\nThe 2018 event, the Mattel World Scrabble Championships, was organised by Mindsports Academy. The main event was held in Torquay, Devon, but the best-of-5 final was held in London to celebrate the game’s 70th anniversary. The event was won by Nigel Richards.\n\n\n"}
