{"id": "11203313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11203313", "title": "Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes", "text": "Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes\n\nSince 1949, a series of armed skirmishes and firefights have occurred along the Durand Line (the Afghanistan–Pakistan border) between the Afghan National Security Forces and the Pakistan Armed Forces. The latest hostilities, which are ongoing, began with the overthrow of the Taliban government.\n\nHostilities existed between Afghanistan and the newly independent Pakistan since 1947, when Afghanistan became the only country to vote against the admission of Pakistan to the United Nations. Afghanistan advocated the independence of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to form Pashtunistan, although the region's predominant Pashtun population had voted overwhelmingly in favor of Pakistan in the referendum held in July 1947. 289,244 (99.02%) votes were cast in favor of Pakistan. Afghan nationalists pressed for an independent state to be called Pashtunistan but the idea became unpopular. The Balochistan province of Pakistan was also included in the Greater Pastunistan definition to gain access to the Arabian sea in case Pakistan failed as a state, as Afghanistan had expected.\n\nThe International border between the British Raj and Afghanistan was established after the 1893 \"Durand Line Agreement\" between British Mortimer Durand of the British Empire and Amir Abdur Rahman Khan of Afghanistan for fixing the limit of their respective spheres of influence. The single-page agreement, which contains seven short articles, was signed by Durand and Khan, agreeing not to exercise political interference beyond the frontier line between Afghanistan and what was then the British Indian Empire.\n\nPakistan inherited the Durand Line agreement after its independence in 1947, but the Afghan Government has always refused to accept the Durand Line Agreement. Afghanistan has several times tried to seize Pakistan's western provinces of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The then Afghan Prime Minister, Muhammad Hashim, said \"if an independent Pashtunistan cannot be set up, the frontier province should join Afghanistan. Our neighbor Pakistan will realize that our country, with its population and trade, needs an outlet to the sea, which is very essential\", in an interview with the Statesman. In 1949, Pakistan Air Force bombed the Afghan sponsored militant camps in border areas including an Afghan village to curb an unrest led by Ipi Faqir propagating independent Pashtunistan. Border clashes were reported in 1949–50 for the first time. On September 30, 1950, Pakistan claimed that Afghan troops and tribesmen had crossed into Pakistan's Balochistan, but the low-scale invasion was repelled after six days of fighting. The Afghan government denied its involvement and claimed that they were pro-Pashtunistan Pashtun tribesmen.\n\nTensions soared with the Pakistani One Unit program, and both countries withdrew ambassadors and diplomatic staff in 1955. The Pakistani Embassy in Kabul and consulates in Kandhar and Jalalabad were attacked by mobs. In 1960, major skirmishes broke with the Afghan Forces massing out on the Afghan side of the border with tanks. These skirmishes saw the Pakistan Air Force bombarding Afghan forces. This bombardment led to a brief hiatus in the skirmishes. On 6 September 1961, Kabul formally severed diplomatic relations with Pakistan. In 1950 the House of Commons of the United Kingdom held its view on the Afghan-Pakistan dispute over the Durand Line by stating:\n\nAt the 1956 SEATO (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization) Ministerial Council Meeting held at Karachi, capital of Pakistan at the time, it was stated:\n\nThe Afghan government, having secured a treaty in December 1978 that allowed them to call on Soviet forces, repeatedly requested the introduction of troops in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 1979. The 1979 Soviet war in Afghanistan forced millions of Afghans to take refuge inside Pakistan. Pakistani officials feared that the Soviet Union began some kind of military show down and that Pakistan or at least its Balochistan province was next on the Soviet agenda. During the early 1980s, multi-national mujahideen forces (consisting of about 100,000 fighters from forty different Muslim countries in addition to 150,000 local fighters) found support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Iran in the context of the Cold War. They were trained by Pakistani military in its frontier region around the Durand Line. The Soviet Union decided to withdraw in 1989 and when aid dried up on Afghanistan in 1992, a civil war began. This was followed by the rise and fall of the Taliban government. Since late 2001, as high as 140,000 NATO-led troops were stationed in Afghanistan to train Afghans and rebuild their war-torn country. In the meantime, the Taliban insurgency began around 2004. To counter the insurgency and bring stability in Afghanistan, the United States built bases and garrisons for the Afghan National Security Forces, and is using unmanned aerial vehicles to carry out drone attacks in Pakistan, mainly the Haqqani network in and around the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).\n\nIn September 2017, Brad Sherman, a US lawmaker, suggested conditioning US aid to Afghanistan to the recognition of Durand Line. He added:\nThe following is an incomplete list of recent events relating to the Afghanistan–Pakistan skirmishes. Most of these events cannot be independently verified because news journalists usually have very limited access to reaching the areas where the fighting take place.\n\n\n"}

He was a chemist, and one of his experiments caused an explosion in which a part of his face was burnt. For the rest of his life he used a veil and thus was known as \"Hashemi\" \"(\"The Veiled One\")\". Nafisi and Arian-Pour have elaborated him on the \"Khorrām-Dīnān\" armies.\n\nBefore he came to be known by the nickname of \"al-Muqanna\", he was called by his birth name, Hashim. Early scholars believed that he was born in Sogdia. However, it is now agreed that his birthplace was in Balkh, a city close to Sogdia.\n\nHāshem was an ethnic Persian from Merv, originally a clothes pleater. He became a commander for Vehzādān Pour Vandād Hormozd \"(Known By The Arabs As: Abu Muslim)\" of Xorāsān province of Iran \"(Persia)\". After Vehzādān's murder in 755 AD, Hashem claimed to be an incarnation of God, a role, he insisted, passed to him from Abū Muslim, who received it via ‘Alī from the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Hāshem was reputed to wear a veil in order to cover up his beauty, whereas his followers wore white clothes in opposition to Abbasid invaders' black. He is reputed to have engaged in magic and miracles in order to gain his followers.\n\nHāshem was instrumental in the formation of the Xhorrām-Dīnān armies which was led by Pāpak Xorram-Din, a Persian uprising whose intent was to overthrow the invading Arabs. When Hāshem's followers started raiding towns and mosques of other Muslims and looting their possessions, the Abbasids sent several commanders to crush the rebellion. Hāshem poisoned himself rather than surrender to the Abbasids, who had set fire to his house. Hāshem died eventually in a Persian fort near Kesh. After his death, the Xhorrām-Dīnān armies continued to exist until the 12th century.\n\nIn 1787 Napoleon Bonaparte wrote a two-page short story about Al-Muqanna called \"Le masque prophete\".\n\nThe first poem in \"Lalla-Rookh\" (1817) by Thomas Moore is titled \"The Veiled Prophet of Khorassan\", and the character Mokanna is modeled loosely on al-Muqanna‘.\n\nSt. Louis businessmen referenced Moore's poem in 1878 when they created the Veiled Prophet Organization and concocted a legend of Mokanna as its founder.\nFor many years the organization put on an annual fair and parade called the \"Veiled Prophet Fair,\" which was renamed Fair Saint Louis in 1992. The organization also gives a debutante ball each December called the Veiled Prophet Ball.\n\nThe Mystic Order of Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm (founded 1889), often known as \"the Grotto\", a social group with membership restricted to Master Masons, and its female auxiliary, the Daughters of Mokanna (founded 1919), also take their names from Thomas Moore's poem.\nArgentine writer Jorge Luis Borges used a fictionalized al-Muqanna‘ as the central character of \"The Masked Dyer, Hakim of Merv\", a 1934 short story, and in another story fifteen years later, \"The Zahir\", as a past avatar of the titular object.\n\n\n\n"}

An individual who works for such an entity was once known as a dog catcher, but is generally now called an animal control officer, and may be an employee or a contractor – commonly employed by a municipality, county, shire, or other subnational government area.\n\nAnimal control services may be provided by the government or through a contract with a humane society or society for the prevention of cruelty to animals. Officers may work for, or with, police or sheriff departments, parks and recreation departments, and health departments by confining animals or investigating animal bites to humans.\n\nThe most common requirements for this job is some prior experience handling animals on a farm, as a veterinary assistant or animal trainer. Training is primarily on the job but some jurisdictions (like Virginia, North Carolina and Texas) require formal and continuing education available from community colleges and trade associations. Some animal cruelty investigators are specially trained police officers, the New York American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) employs several Humane Law Enforcement Officers with some police powers (including the power of arrest); and throughout the United States this arrangement is becoming more common.\n\nAnimals may be returned to their owners, or transported to a veterinary clinic or animal shelter. Animals held in the shelter can be returned to their owners, adopted, released to the wild, held as evidence in a criminal investigation or put to sleep.\n\nActive cruelty to animals, such as chaining, may be an indicator of serious psychological or violence problems. Because of these links, in some places animal control officers have begun to look for and report on other issues.\n\nAn American colloquialism labels an unpopular politician by saying that he or she \"couldn't be elected dogcatcher\", with \"dogcatcher\" referring to a very low-level elected office. In practice, animal control officers are generally appointed by an executive authority and not elected\n\nIn 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump criticized Senator Bob Corker by tweeting: \"Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts... / ...Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump.

{"id": "286348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=286348", "title": "Annie Get Your Gun (musical)", "text": "Annie Get Your Gun (musical)\n\nAnnie Get Your Gun is a musical with lyrics and music by Irving Berlin and a book by Dorothy Fields and her brother Herbert Fields. The story is a fictionalized version of the life of Annie Oakley (1860–1926), a sharpshooter who starred in Buffalo Bill's Wild West, and her romance with sharpshooter Frank E. Butler (1847–1926).\n\nThe 1946 Broadway production was a hit, and the musical had long runs in both New York (1,147 performances) and London, spawning revivals, a 1950 film version and television versions. Songs that became hits include \"There's No Business Like Show Business\", \"Doin' What Comes Natur'lly\", \"You Can't Get a Man with a Gun\", \"They Say It's Wonderful\", and \"Anything You Can Do.\"\n\nDorothy Fields had the idea for a musical about Annie Oakley, to star her friend, Ethel Merman. Producer Mike Todd turned the project down, so Fields approached a new producing team, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. After the success of their first musical collaboration, \"Oklahoma!\", Rodgers and Hammerstein had decided to become producers of both their own theatrical ventures and those by other authors. They agreed to produce the musical and asked Jerome Kern to compose the music; Fields would write the lyrics, and she and her brother Herbert would write the book. Kern, who had been composing for movie musicals in Hollywood, returned to New York on November 2, 1945 to begin work on the score to \"Annie Get Your Gun\", but three days later, he collapsed on the street due to a cerebral hemorrhage. Kern was hospitalized, and he died on November 11, 1945. The producers and Fields then asked Irving Berlin to write the musical's score; Fields agreed to step down as lyricist, knowing that Berlin preferred to write both music and lyrics to his songs. Berlin initially declined to write the score, worrying that he would be unable to write songs to fit specific scenes in \"a situation show.\" Hammerstein persuaded him to study the script and try writing some songs based on it, and within days, Berlin returned with the songs \"Doin' What Comes Naturally\", \"You Can't Get a Man With a Gun\", and \"There's No Business Like Show Business\". Berlin's songs suited the story and Ethel Merman's abilities, and he readily composed the rest of the score to \"Annie Get Your Gun\". The show's eventual hit song, \"There's No Business Like Show Business,\" was almost left out of the show because Berlin mistakenly got the impression that Richard Rodgers did not like it. In imitation of the structure of \"Oklahoma!\" a secondary romance between two of the members of the Wild West Show was added to the musical during its development.\nAccording to some sources, the role of Annie was originally offered to Mary Martin who turned it down. Ill on opening night, she was represented by her husband, Richard Halliday. Upon his return home following the premiere, he informed her, \"You're going to kill yourself!\" When time came to send out the post-Broadway national tour and Merman was unwilling to do it, Martin jumped at the chance, going on the road for approximately two years and belting out the songs, which had the effect of lowering her voice from its normal lyric-coloratura range to mezzo-soprano-alto. \nFor the 1999 revival, Peter Stone revised the libretto, eliminating what were considered insensitive references to American Indians, including the songs \"Colonel Buffalo Bill\" and \"I'm An Indian Too\". Stone said, \"The big challenge is taking a book that was wonderfully crafted for its time and make it wonderfully crafted for our time... It was terribly insensitive...to Indians... But it had to be dealt with in a way that was heartfelt and not obvious... In this case, it was with the permission of the heirs. They're terribly pleased with it.\" Stone also altered the structure of the musical, beginning it with \"There's No Business Like Show Business\" and presenting the musical as a \"show within a show\".\n\nWhen the traveling Buffalo Bill's Wild West show visits Cincinnati, Ohio (\"Colonel Buffalo Bill\"§), Frank Butler, the show's handsome, womanizing star (\"I'm a Bad, Bad, Man\"§), challenges anyone in town to a shooting match. Foster Wilson, a local hotel owner, doesn't appreciate the Wild West show taking over his hotel, so Frank gives him a side bet of one hundred dollars on the match. Annie Oakley enters and shoots a bird off Dolly Tate's hat, and then explains her simple backwoods ways to Wilson with the help of her siblings (\"Doin' What Comes Natur'lly\"). When Wilson learns she's a brilliant shot, he enters her in the shooting match against Frank Butler.\n\nWhile waiting for the match to start, Annie meets Frank Butler and is instantly smitten with him, not knowing he will be her opponent. When she asks Frank if he likes her, Frank explains that the girl he wants will \"wear satin... and smell of cologne\" (\"The Girl That I Marry\"). The rough and naive Annie comically laments that \"You Can't Get a Man with a Gun.\" At the shooting match, Annie finds out that Frank is the \"big swollen-headed stiff\" from the Wild West show. She wins the contest, and Buffalo Bill and Charlie Davenport, the show's manager, invite Annie to join the Wild West Show. Annie agrees because she loves Frank even though she has no idea what \"show business\" is. Frank, Charlie, and Buffalo Bill explain that \"There's No Business Like Show Business.\"\n\nOver the course of working together, Frank becomes enamored of the plain-spoken, honest, tomboyish Annie and, as they travel to Minneapolis, Minnesota on a train, he explains to her what \"love\" is (\"They Say It's Wonderful\"). Buffalo Bill and Charlie discover that their rival, Pawnee Bill's Far East Show, will be playing in Saint Paul, Minnesota while the Wild West show plays in nearby Minneapolis. They ask Annie to do a special shooting stunt on a motorcycle to draw Pawnee Bill's business away. Annie agrees because the trick will surprise Frank. She sings her siblings to sleep with the \"Moonshine Lullaby.\"\n\nAs Annie and Frank prepare for the show, Frank plans to propose to Annie after the show and then ruefully admits that \"My Defenses Are Down\". When Annie performs her trick and becomes a star, Chief Sitting Bull adopts her into the Sioux tribe (\"I'm An Indian Too\"§). Hurt and angry, Frank walks out on Annie and the show, joining the competing Pawnee Bill's show.\n\nReturning to New York from a tour of Europe with the Buffalo Bill show, Annie learns that the show has gone broke. Sitting Bull, Charlie, and Buffalo Bill plot to merge Buffalo Bill's show with Pawnee Bill's as they believe that show is doing well financially. Annie, now well-dressed and more refined and worldly, still longs for Frank (\"I Got Lost in His Arms\").\n\nAt a grand reception for Buffalo Bill's troupe at the Hotel Brevoort, Pawnee Bill, Dolly, and Frank also plot a merger of the two companies, assuming Buffalo Bill's show made a fortune touring Europe. When they all meet, they soon discover both shows are broke. Annie, however, has received sharpshooting medals from all the rulers of Europe worth one hundred thousand dollars, and she decides to sell the medals to finance the merger, rejoicing in the simple things (\"I Got the Sun in the Mornin'\"). When Frank appears, he and Annie confess their love and decide to marry, although with comically different ideas: Frank wants \"some little chapel,\" while Annie wants \"A wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls/ A lot of ushers in tail coats/ Reporters and photographers\" (\"An Old-Fashioned Wedding\"º). When Annie shows Frank her medals, Frank again has his pride hurt. They call off the merger and the wedding, but challenge each other to one last shooting match to decide who is the best shot.\n\nOn the ferry to the Governors Island match site, Dolly attempts to ruin Annie's chances by tampering with her guns. She is caught and stopped by Sitting Bull and Charlie. However, they then decide to follow through with Dolly's plan so that Annie will lose the match, knowing that would soothe Frank's ego allowing the two to reconcile and the merger to take place.\n\nAs the match is ready to begin, Annie and Frank's egos come out again with each claiming they are better than the other (\"Anything You Can Do\"). Sitting Bull convinces Annie to deliberately lose the match to Frank, reminding her that she \"can't get a man with a gun.\" That done, Frank and Annie finally reconcile, deciding to marry and merge the shows.\n\n\"Notes\":\n\n\n\"Notes\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"\"An Old-Fashioned Wedding\" was written by Berlin for the 1966 revision, sung by Annie and Frank, and was also included in the 1999 revival\"\n\n\"Annie Get Your Gun\" premiered on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on May 16, 1946 and ran for 1,147 performances.

This tour also played Chicago and Los Angeles. Martin stayed with the tour until mid-1948.\n\nThe show had its West End premiere on June 7, 1947 at the London Coliseum where it ran for 1,304 performances. Dolores Gray played Annie with Bill Johnson as Frank.\n\nThe first Australian production opened at His Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne on July 19, 1947. It starred Evie Hayes as Annie with Webb Tilton as Frank.\n\nA French version, \"Annie du Far-West\", starring Marcel Merkes and Lily Fayol, began production at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris on 19 February 1950 and ran for over a year.\n\nThe show had its first Broadway revival in 1966 at the Music Theater of Lincoln Center. This production opened on May 31, 1966 and ran until July 9, followed by a short 10-week U.S. Tour. It returned to Broadway at the Broadway Theatre on September 21 for 78 performances. Ethel Merman reprised her original role as Annie with Bruce Yarnell as Frank, Benay Venuta as Dolly, and Jerry Orbach as Charles Davenport. The libretto and score were revised: The secondary romance between Tommy Keeler and Winnie Tate was completely eliminated, including their songs \"I'll Share it All With You\" and \"Who Do You Love, I Hope?\", and the song \"An Old-Fashioned Wedding\" was specially written for the revival and added to the second act. This version of the show is available for licensing for amateur performances. This production was telecast in an abbreviated ninety-minute version by NBC on March 19, 1967 and is the only musical revived at Lincoln Center during the 1960s to be telecast.\n\nJay Harnick directed a revival at the Shady Grove Music Fair starring Barbara Eden, John Bennett Perry and Sandra Peabody that ran from 1973 to 1974.\n\nIn 1976 a Spanish-language version was produced in Mexico City with the name of \"Annie es un tiro\". It was directed by José Luis Ibáñez and starred by Mexican film star Silvia Pinal. The production was represented at the Teatro Hidalgo and was co starred by the actor and singer Manuel López Ochoa. The success of the production produced the first Spanish-language version of the musical's soundtrack.\n\nIn 1977, Gower Champion directed a revival for the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera starring Debbie Reynolds as Annie. The Assistant Director was James Mitchell. Harve Presnell, Reynolds's former co-star in the 1964 film \"The Unsinkable Molly Brown\", played Frank Butler. The cast featured Art Lund as Buffalo Bill, Bibi Osterwald as Dolly Tate, Gavin MacLeod as Charlie Davenport,\nPeter Bruni as Foster Wilson, Don Potter as Pawnee Bill, and Manu Tupou as Sitting Bull. The cast also included Trey Wilson and Debbie Shapiro. The production later toured various North American cities, but never ran on Broadway, its planned destination.\n\nIn 1986, a David Gilmore Chichester Festival Theatre production, with American rock star Suzi Quatro as Annie and Eric Flynn as Frank, opened at the Chichester Festival Theatre. It moved to the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, and then to the Aldwych Theatre in London's West End where it played from July 29 to October 4. The cast recorded an album, Annie Get Your Gun - 1986 London Cast and Quatro's songs \"I Got Lost in His Arms\"/\"You Can't Get a Man with a Gun\" were released as a single. Since then \"I Got Lost in His Arms\" has also been included in the compilation albums \"The Divas Collection\" (2003) and \"Songs from the Greatest Musicals\" (2008).\n\nA short-lived London production ran at the Prince of Wales Theatre in the West End, starring Kim Criswell as Annie. Criswell's studio cast recording of the show - made with Thomas Hampson and conductor John McGlinn - provided the impetus for the production.\n\nIn 1999, a new production had its pre-Broadway engagement at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., from December 29, 1998 to January 24, 1999. Previews began on Broadway on February 2, 1999 at the Marquis Theatre, with an official opening on March 4, 1999, and closed on September 1, 2001 after 35 previews and 1,045 performances.\n\nThis revival starred Bernadette Peters as Annie and Tom Wopat as Frank, and Ron Holgate as Buffalo Bill, with direction by Graciela Daniele, choreographey by Jeff Calhoun, and music arrangements by John McDaniel. Peters won the 1999 Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical and the production won the Tony for Best Revival of a Musical.\n\nThis production had a revised book by Peter Stone and new orchestrations, and was structured as a \"show-within-a-show\", set as a Big Top travelling circus. \"Frank Butler\" is alone on stage and Buffalo Bill introduces the main characters, singing \"There's No Business Like Show Business\", which is reprised when \"Annie\" agrees to join the traveling Wild West show. The production dropped several songs (including \"Colonel Buffalo Bill\", \"I'm A Bad, Bad Man\", and \"I'm an Indian Too\"), but included \"An Old-Fashioned Wedding\". There were several major dance numbers added, including a ballroom scene. A sub-plot which had been dropped from the 1966 revival, the romance between Winnie and Tommy, her part-Native-American boyfriend, was also included. In the 1946 production, Winnie was Dolly's daughter, but the 1966 &1999 productions she is Dolly's younger sister. In this version, the final shooting match between Annie and Frank ends in a tie.\n\nWhile Peters was on vacation, \"All My Children\" star Susan Lucci made her Broadway debut as Annie from December 27, 1999 until Jan. 16, 2000. Peters and Wopat left the show on September 2, 2000. Former \"Charlie's Angels\" star Cheryl Ladd made her Broadway debut as Annie on September 6, 2000, with Patrick Cassidy as Frank Butler. Country music superstar Reba McEntire made her Broadway debut as Annie from January 26, 2001 to June 22, 2001 opposite Brent Barrett as Frank. On June 23, 2001, Crystal Bernard, who had been playing Annie in the national tour of \"Annie Get Your Gun\", assumed the role of Annie in the Broadway production.\n\nThe 1999 Broadway production, in a \"slightly revised version\", toured in a U.S. national tour starting in Dallas, Texas on July 25, 2000 with Marilu Henner and Rex Smith. Tom Wopat joined the tour in late October 2000, replacing Smith.\n\nIn 2006, the Prince Music Theater of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, revived the 1966 Lincoln Center Theater version for one month. This production starred Andrea McArdle (the original Annie of the 1977 Broadway musical \"Annie\"), Jeffrey Coon as Frank Butler, John Scherer as Charlie Davenport, Chris Councill as Buffalo Bill, Mary Martello as Dolly Tate, and Arthur Ryan as Sitting Bull. The production was well received by critics. The production was directed by Richard M. Parison, Jr. and choreographed by Mercedes Ellington.\n\nJane Horrocks, Julian Ovenden and director Richard Jones mounted a major London revival at the Young Vic, Waterloo. The show opened at the off west end venue on 16 October 2009, initially booking until 2 January 2010 but with an extra week added due to popular demand.The production featured new arrangements by Jason Carr for a band consisting four pianos. London's Guardian newspaper awarded the show 5 stars, claiming that \"Richard Jones's brilliant production offers the wittiest musical staging London has seen in years.\" \n\nA concert staging of the original version of \"Annie Get Your Gun\" took place at the Ravinia Festival, Chicago from August 13–15, 2010 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Annie Oakley's birth. Directed by Lonny Price, the concert starred Patti LuPone as Annie, Patrick Cassidy as Frank and George Hearn as Buffalo Bill. The concert received unanimously strong reviews, notably for LuPone and Price's direction.\n\nLucie Arnaz starred in a production in the summer of 1978 with Harve Presnell at the Jones Beach Theater on Nassau County, New York. This was the first major production of the musical done in the New York area after the 1966 revival.\n\nThe Paper Mill Playhouse produced a well-reviewed production in June 1987 starring Judy Kaye as Annie and Richard White as Frank.\n\nIn 2004, Marina Prior and Scott Irwin starred in an Australian production of the 1999 Broadway rewrite of the show.\n\nIn 2014 Carter Calvert and David Weitzer starred in a production that opened the Algonquin Arts Theatre's 2014-2015 Broadway Season. It was also the first show to be performed after the Algonquin underwent the task of installing new seating which had not been done since 1938.\n\nIn October 2015, a two night concert version was presented at the New York City Center Gala starring Megan Hilty (Annie Oakley) and Andy Karl (Frank Butler). The concerts are directed by John Rando, and the cast features Judy Kaye (Dolly Tate), Ron Raines (Buffalo Bill), Brad Oscar (Charlie) and Chuck Cooper (Pawnee Bill).\n\nIn 1950, Metro Goldwyn Mayer made a well-received movie version of the musical. Although MGM purchased the rights to the film version with an announced intention of starring legendary singer-actress Judy Garland as Annie, early work on the film was plagued with difficulties, some attributed to Garland's health. Garland was fired and replaced by the brassier, blonde Betty Hutton.\n\nIn 1957, a production starring Mary Martin as Annie and John Raitt as Frank Butler was broadcast on NBC. In 1967, the Lincoln Center production described above, starring Ethel Merman and Bruce Yarnell, was broadcast on NBC. The Mary Martin version has been re-broadcast sporadically over the years, but the 1967 videotapes starring Ethel Merman have apparently been irretrievably lost. Only a video and audio clip of \"I Got the Sun in the Mornin' (and the Moon at Night)\" is known to exist, as does an audio-only recording of the entire 90-minute show.\n\nThere are several recordings of the \"Annie Get Your Gun\" score, including:\n\nConductor John Owen Edwards along with JAY Records recorded the first ever complete recording, with all musical numbers, scene change music and incidental music, of the show's score in the 1990s with Judy Kaye and Barry Bostwick starred. Christopher Lee had the role of Sitting Bull.\n\nThe original Broadway production opened to favorable reviews. Critics unanimously praised Ethel Merman's performance as Annie Oakley, though some thought the score and book were not particularly distinguished. John Chapman of the \"Daily News\" declared that the production had \"good lyrics and tunes by Irving Berlin...[and] the razzle-dazzle atmosphere of a big-time show\" but pronounced Merman the best part of the show, stating \"She is a better comedienne than she ever was before\", stating that \"\"Annie\" is a good, standard, lavish, big musical and I'm sure it will be a huge success--but it isn't the greatest show in the world\". Louis Kronenberger of \"PM\" stated that the show was 'in many ways routine\", but greatly praised Merman's performance, opining, \"For me, \"Annie\" is mainly Miss Merman's show, though the rest of it is competent enough of its kind...Irving Berlin's score is musically not exciting--of the real songs, only one or two are tuneful\".\nWard Morehouse of \"The New York Sun\" declared, \"The big news about \"Annie Get Your Gun\" is that it reveals Ethel Merman in her best form since \"Anything Goes\"...She shouts the Berlin music with good effect. She often comes to the aid of a sagging book\". He stated, \"Irving Berlin's score is not a notable one, but his tunes are singable and pleasant and his lyrics are particularly good. The book? It's on the flimsy side, definitely. And rather witless too\". Lewis Nichols of \"The New York Times\" said, \"It has a pleasant score by Irving Berlin...and it has Ethel Merman to roll her eyes and to shout down the rafters. The colors are pretty, the dancing is amiable and unaffected, and Broadway by this time is well used to a book which doesn't get anywhere in particular\".\n\nHowever, the show itself was greatly lauded by some critics: Vernon Rice of the \"New York Post\" proclaimed, \"Irving Berlin has outdone himself this time. No use trying to pick a hit tune, for all the tunes are hits...Ethel Merman is at her lusty, free and easy best...She is now able to develop a consistent characterization and stay with it to the show's end. And when she opens her mouth to sing, she sings!\" William Hawkins of the \"New York World-Telegram\" said that Merman was \"bright as a whip, sure as her shooting, and generously the foremost lady clown of her time\" and asserted that the show itself was comparable to those of Rodgers and Hammerstein, proclaiming, \"For verve and buoyancy, unslackening, there has seldom if ever been a show like it...the girls in \"Annie\" have the beauty and character of looks one associates with a Rodgers and Hammerstein show. And the production has in every way the distinction that has become their hallmark\".\n\nHistorians have viewed the show as inaccurate, citing among other reasons its portrayal of Annie as a loud, boisterous character, when in reality she had a quiet personality and did needlepoint in her spare time.\n\nNative Americans have criticized the shows portrayal of Redface and promotion of cultural stereotypes. Particularly in the song \"I'm an Indian Too\" sung by Annie after Sitting Bull adopts her into the Sioux tribe.\n\nNative Americans did protest outside the New York theatre, as well as movie theaters, holding picket signs stating: \"Don't See \"Annie Get Your Gun\". As a result of this reaction, many contemporary productions have omitted the song from their revivals, and the protests stopped.\n\n\n\n"}

The series was founded by Jürgen Barth, Patrick Peter, and Stéphane Ratel (their last names forming the BPR name) as an international endurance racing series to replace the World Sportscar Championship which had ended in 1992.\n\nFollowing the demise of the World Sportscar Championship in 1992, there were no international sports car racing series in existence, only small national series or manufacturer cup races featuring nearly identical cars. Patrick Peter and Stéphane Ratel of the Venturi series in France along with Jürgen Barth of the German Porsche series entered into discussions to combine their one-make series into an international championship that would bring back endurance racing to most of Europe as well as the rest of the world.\n\nThe series began in 1994 with an eight race schedule, including visits to Japan and China, with races of approximately four hours in length. Fields were initially made of a variety of Porsche and Venturi racing cars from various racing series broken into a wide variety of classes before later being joined by a modified Ferrari F40, Lotus Esprits, and Callaway Corvettes.\n\nIn 1995 the series would expand to twelve rounds and the amount of manufacturer interest was increased as new supercars such as the McLaren F1 GTR, Ferrari F40 GTE, and Jaguar XJ220 would appear, as well as lower class competitors like the Porsche 911 GT2 and De Tomaso Pantera. By 1996, manufacturer involvement had driven out most of the smaller cup cars, leading to the series slimming down to a mere two classes. \n\nThe manufacturer interest in the series reached a high point when Porsche launched their 911 GT1, a homologated supercar that was intended first as a racing car. Due to the amount manufacturer involvement, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) decided that the series would be best managed by themselves, leading to the series being reformed into the FIA GT Championship, where it continues till 2009. Stéphane Ratel would remain in charge of the series commercial rights.\n\nAlthough the BPR series was technically dead, some of its organizers would move onto other series. In France, Patrick Peter would create a new series in association with the French FFSA motorsport organization, known as the FFSA GT Championship. Cars would be less powerful than those seen in the other years of BPR, retaining the initial four class format, although this would be abandoned in later years.\n\nStéphane Ratel would create the SRO and help launch the GTR Euroseries in 1998 for privateer teams to avoid the large manufacturer involvement now seen in FIA GT. The GTR Euroseries would also retain the four-hour race format that was no longer used by FIA GT. Unfortunately this series would fail during its initial season. SRO would go on to create various other national GT series.\n\nIn 2006, the SRO announced the launch of the GT90's Revival Series, a historic racing series intended to see classic cars from the BPR series return to the track.\n\nUnlike the World Sportscar Championship, which used custom built racing cars, the BPR series would use production sportscars which were modified into racing cars. Manufacturers would be required to have built a certain amount of production cars for sale, with the amount of homologation vehicles set by the class in which the car wished to participate. Initially four classes were used (GT1 through GT4) before being changed to two classes in 1996 (GT1 and GT2). The upper classes allowed deeper modifications from the production vehicles, including the use of exotic materials and non-production parts.\n\nTeams were required to have two drivers per car, with each driver being required to drive a minimum amount in order to score points. Some teams could run three if they wished, although this was mostly used for amateur teams.\n\nAlthough multiple classes raced in the early years of BPR, only a single overall championship was rewarded.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for historical scenes from the Risorgimento.\n\nHis father was a stonemason of Italian origin, working in Switzerland. In 1820, his family moved to accept work in Odessa. Until 1826, he studied with the Capuchins. After graduating, he worked in a shop that sold antiquarian books and prints. It was there that he began to draw and sketch. In 1828, he was hired by the Odessa Opera to work as an assistant to Rinaldo Nannini (?-?), a stage designer who had studied at La Scala under Alessandro Sanquirico. He began to sell his paintings in 1833. His father died three years later and he found himself the sole support of his mother, his sister and her illegitimate son. \n\nLuckily, his work drew the attention of Prince Mikhail Vorontsov, who commissioned him to paint several views of Odessa. Princess Elizabeta was impressed with his abilities and arranged for him to study in Italy from 1839 to 1840. He stayed mostly in Naples and Rome, giving special attention to tempera and gouache and associating with the many British artists who were living there. He returned in 1840 and settled in the coastal resort of Alupka, on the Vorontsov estate.\n\nIn 1844, at the request of his mother (who was ill), he moved to Milan and opened a studio there. In 1848, he produced popular scenes from \"Five Days of Milan\". His mother died the following year, but he remained there until 1853, when an unsuccessful uprising against the Austrians forced him to flee to Turin, which he used as his base of operations for travels to England, France, Spain, Morocco, Germany and Scandinavia.\n\nDuring those years, he produced an album of paintings, showing views of Crimea, which was published in London by Day & Son. It proved to be very popular due to public interest in the Crimean War. Later, in 1859, they commissioned him to produce a series of lithographs depicting the Second Italian War of Independence which were published as \"The War in Italy\".\n\nAfter seeing them, young Prince Oddone gave him a commission to follow the Piedmontese Army and make a record of its campaigns. The result was an album of 150 tempera paintings and the Prince declared him to be \"the painter of our history\". He fell ill with a fever at this time and his productivity declined dramatically. He divided his time between decorating his home to resemble the Vorontsov Palace and doting on his nephew.\n\nIn 1883, at the age of sixty-eight, he married Adelaide De Carolis, who was only twenty-one; The marriage was generally believed to be a financial arrangement. The following year, he died of a heart attack. He was buried in Lugano and a street in Turin is named after him.\n\n\n\n"}

It was published without an author's name attached, but is often attributed to Thomas Heywood, perhaps writing with collaborators.\n\nThe two parts were entered into the Stationers' Register together on 28 August 1599, and were published together later that year in a quarto issued by the bookseller John Oxenbridge. The title page of the first edition states that the play was acted by \"the Earl of Derby his servants\". A second quarto was released in 1600 by Oxenbridge and Humphrey Lownes. The play was popular, and was reprinted in 1605, 1613, 1619, and 1626. All of the early quartos were anonymous; Heywood was first connected with the plays by Francis Kirkman in his 1661 play list.\n\nThe central character in the play is Jane Shore, the king's mistress. The historical events of the reign of Edward IV form a background, involving \"the bastard Faulconbridge,\" the \"Tanner of Tamworth,\" and other figures of the era. The play draws material from the 1587 edition of Holinshed's \"Chronicles\". \n\nThe play shows Edward wooing Jane, Jane struggling with the morality of accepting the king's offers, but using her influence to grant pardons to those wrongfully punished. In the end she expresses regret for her relationship with Edward. After Edward's death she is cast out by the new king Richard III. In this version of events, Jane is reconciled with her husband right before dying. They are buried together in a ditch which is named \"Shores Ditch, as in the memory of them\". This is supposed to be the origin of the name Shoreditch.\n\nThe play has often been attributed to Heywood; the normally cautious W. W. Greg regarded it as \"undoubtedly Heywood's\" — though the rarely cautious F. G. Fleay demurred. Some scholars have dated the play as early as 1594; others have favored a date toward the end of that decade. The records of theatre manager Philip Henslowe show that Henry Chettle and John Day were working on a play about Jane Shore in May 1603 for Worcester's Men, the company with which Heywood was associated at the time. A play on Jane Shore was popular in the first decade of the 17th century, and is mentioned in \"The Knight of the Burning Pestle\" (1607) and \"Pimlico or Run Red-Cap\" (1609). In Part 1 of \"Edward IV\", Act III scene ii, is a three-part song about the Battle of Agincourt that strongly resembles Michael Drayton's \"The Ballad of Agincourt\" — and Drayton was a regular writer for Henslowe c. 1600 and frequently collaborated with Chettle and others. All of these facts and factors, taken together, suggest that \"Edward IV\" was composed by Heywood, perhaps with other Henslowe house dramatists, and perhaps revised over a span of years by various hands.\n\nIn 1607, a company of English actors touring Austria were at the archducal court of Graz; on 19 November they performed, for Archduke Ferdinand II and his duchess Maria Anna of Bavaria, a play called \"The King of England and the Goldsmith's Wife\" — which might have been \"Edward IV\".\n"}

The cause of falling in old age is often multifactorial, and may require a multidisciplinary approach both to treat any injuries sustained and to prevent future falls. Falls include dropping from a standing position, or from exposed positions such as those on ladders or stepladders. The severity of injury is generally related to the height of the fall. The state of the ground surface onto which the victim falls is also important, harder surfaces causing more severe injury. Falls can be prevented by ensuring that carpets are tacked down, that objects like electric cords are not in one's path, that hearing and vision are optimized, dizziness is minimized, alcohol intake is moderated and that shoes have low heels or rubber soles.\n\nA review of clinical trial evidence by the European Food Safety Authority led to a recommendation that people over age 60 years should supplement the diet with vitamin D to reduce the risk of falling and bone fractures. Falls are an important aspect of geriatric medicine.\n\nOther definitions are more inclusive and do not exclude \"major intrinsic events\" as a fall. Falls are of concern within medical treatment facilities. Fall prevention is usually a priority in healthcare settings.\n\nA 2006 review of literature identified the need for standardization of falls taxonomy due to the variation within research. The Prevention of Falls Network Europe (ProFane) taxonomy for the definition and reporting of falls aimed at mitigating this problem. ProFane recommended that a \"fall\" be defined as \"an unexpected event in which the participants come to rest on the ground, floor, or lower level.\" The ProFane taxonomy is currently used as a framework to appraise falls-related research studies in Cochrane Systematic Reviews.\n\n\nFalls are often caused by a number of factors. The faller may live with many risk factors for falling and only have problems when another factor appears. As such, management is often tailored to treating the factor that caused the fall, rather than all of the risk factors a patient has for falling.\nRisk factors may be grouped into intrinsic factors, such as existence of a specific ailment or disease. External or extrinsic factors includes the environment and the way in which it may encourage or deter accidental falls. Such factors as lighting and illumination, personal aid equipment and floor traction are all important in fall prevention.\n\n\n\nWhen assessing a person who has fallen, it is important to try to get an eyewitness account of the incident. As the faller may have had some loss of consciousness, they may not give an accurate description of the fall. However, in practice, these eyewitness accounts are often unavailable. It is also important to remember than 30% of cognitively intact older people are unable to remember a documented fall three months later.\nImportant points of inquiry:\n\nFall prevention is accomplished first with a detailed assessment of the risk for falls.\n\nA large body of evidence shows that an efforts that include exercise decrease the risk of falls.\n\nPossible interventions to prevent falls include:\n\nInterventions to minimize the consequences of falls:\n\nPeople who are hospitalized are at risk for falling. A randomized trial showed that use of a tool kit reduced falls in hospitals. Nurses complete a valid fall risk assessment scale. From that, a software package develops customized fall prevention interventions to address patients' specific determinants of fall risk. The kit also has bed posters with brief text and an accompanying icon, patient education handouts, and plans of care, all communicating patient-specific alerts to key stakeholders.\n\nAmerican Geriatrics society (AGS)/British Geriatrics Society (BGS) recommend that all older adults should be screened for \"falls in the past year\". Fall history is the strongest risk factor associated with subsequent falls. Older people who have experienced at least one fall in the last 6 months, or who believe that they may fall in the coming months, should be evaluated with the aim of reducing their risk of recurrent falls.\n\nMany health institutions in USA have developed screening questionnaires. Enquiry includes difficulty with walking and balance, medication use to help with sleep/mood, loss of sensation in feet, vision problems, fear of falling, and use of assistive devices for walking.\n\nOlder adults who report falls should be asked about their circumstances and frequency to assess risks from gait and balance which may be compromised. A fall risk assessment is done by a clinician to include history, physical exam, functional capability, and environment.\n\nThe incidence of falls increases progressively with age. According to the existing scientific literature, approximately one-third of the elderly population experiences one or more falls each year, while 10% experience multiple falls annually. The risk is greater in people older than 80 years, in which the annual incidence of falls can reach 50%.\n\nResearchers have tried to create a consensual definition of a fall since the 1980s. Tinneti et al. defined a \"fall\" as \"an event which results in a person coming to rest unintentionally on the ground or other lower level, not as a result of a major intrinsic event (such as a stroke) or overwhelming hazard.”\n\nThe health care impact and costs of falls in older adults is significantly rising all over the world. The cost of falls are categorized into 2 aspects: direct cost and indirect cost.\n\nDirect costs are what patients and insurance companies pay for treating fall-related injuries. This includes fees for hospital and nursing home, doctors and other professional services, rehabilitation, community-based services, use of medical equipment, prescription drugs, changes made to home and insurance processing.\n\nIndirect costs include the loss of productivity of family caregivers and long-term effects of fall-related injuries such as disability, dependence on others and reduced quality of life.\n\nIn the United States alone, the total cost of falling injuries for people 65 and older was $31 billion in 2015. The costs covered millions of hospital emergency room visits for non-fatal injuries and more than 800,000 hospitalizations. By 2030, the annual number of falling injuries is expected to be 74 million older adults.\n\nFurthermore, a recent systematic review has demonstrated that performing dual-task tests (for example, combining a walking task with a counting task) may help in predicting which people are at an increased risk of a fall.\n\n"}

The festival has been held since 1923 and is one of the biggest cultural events in Brittany.\n\nThe festival putting forward the Breton culture in its diversity and its richness. About 180 shows, concerts and animations take place in the day and in the evening in the urban heart of the city of Quimper: \"a festival in the heart of a city and a culture\".\n\nThe festival was founded in 1923 as a sort of beauty contest ; The idea was to choose the most beautiful girl in the region and crowned queen of the festival . hair To the so-called Festival des Reines continued to dress the Breton bards Taldir, Jaffrenou and Botrel were present, as were the folk dancers Plozévet.

In 1947 the \"Qeens Festival\" was renamed \"Les grandes Fêtes de Cornouaille\". The first Fêtes was a four-hour folk festival, focusing on the Breton tradition .\n\nIn 1948 a 16 - year-old girl was elected festival queen, which had a lot of criticism from the Roman Catholic Church as a result. Since 1949, there is then no longer elected festival queen and the party has an emphatic folkloric character . It is the festival that year expanded from one day to one week . In the 50s, the festival has developed into the leading festival of Breton culture .\n\nFor 1992, the famous guitarist Dan Ar Braz, who comes from Quimper, was asked to organize musical part of the festival : this resulted in the Héritage des Celtes project, in which 70 Celtic musicians worked together.

She is best known for her roles as first Director of the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry and as a co-founder of the Affiliated Schools for Workers (later known as the American Labor Education Service), though she also had a long career in government service supporting education for underserved groups including women, labor workers, and the elderly.\n\nWorthington Smith was born in 1888 in New York City. Her father's invention of a steamheating system, which heated many of the early office buildings of New York, provided the family with a handsome fortune. She attended Bryn Mawr College between 1906 and 1910 for her undergraduate degree, during which she was elected to lead the student body as president of the Self Government Association. Worthington Smith remained at Bryn Mawr the following year and left in 1911 with a master's degree in ethics and psychology, after which she received a second graduate degree from the New York School of Philanthropy (which exists currently as the Columbia University School of Social Work). When she was twenty-five years old she returned to Bryn Mawr at the invitation of President of the College, M. Carey Thomas, to oversee a residence hall as a Warden, and began to teach an informal class on social work at the request of a group of undergraduates in which she introduced the concepts of child welfare, family rehabilitation, delinquency, immigration, and housing. She returned to her studies at the School of Philanthropy in 1914 and soon established a community center for youth in New York City that served many boys of Irish, Italian, and African American descent, which she ran until M. Carey Thomas offered her the position of Acting Dean in 1919. In the two years that she served as Dean, her interest in workers' education was already becoming an area of active pursuit: in addition to her duties mentoring undergraduate students and administering college programs, Smith took the initiative to arrange night classes for the black college gardeners and service employees.\n\nA pivotal moment in Worthington Smith's career came in 1921, when President Thomas asked her to head the Bryn Mawr Summer School for Women Workers in Industry, a brand new initiative that Thomas envisioned and set into motion after visiting Workers' Educational Association programs in England. Though Thomas was the original visionary of the school, Worthington Smith is credited with developing it into the immensely successful program that it became and setting the example for a host of other similar programs that were founded in its image, including the Wisconsin Summer School, Barnard Summer School, Vineyard Shore School, Southern Summer School, and the coeducational Hudson Shore Labor School. The Summer School was a residential program on the campus of Bryn Mawr College that operated for 8 weeks in the summer every year (except for 1935) between 1921 and 1938, hosting and educating female factory workers from all over the country who numbered approximately 1700 over the duration of the initiative. Money was raised for scholarships to support the students, who were between the ages of 18 and 35 and came from diverse backgrounds including different nationalities, races, religions, industries, non-unionized and union affiliations. About 100 women attended each year that the school operated, gathering to live, eat, and sleep together while they studied a variety of liberal arts subjects with distinguished faculty drawn from local institutions.\n\nThe object of the school, as stated in prospectus and distributed to a variety of news outlets, was \"to offer young women of character and ability a fuller education and an opportunity to study liberal subjects in order that they might widen their influence in the industrial world, help in the coming social reconstruction and increase the happiness and usefulness of their own lives.\" The focus was therefore on giving women the knowledge and tools to exercise agency in their lives, and to become leaders in their communities in a new era of social change.\n\nMs. Thomas had come into contact with the workers' education movement while traveling thru England and the Scandinavian countries after World War I. Determining that this country needed a version of this school she chose Dean Smith to start it. Ms. Smith directed the school for its first 13 years, first at Bryn Mawr, then later at West Park, N.Y., at her family home, HeartsEase.\n\nBy 1927 there were a group of labor schools called the Affiliated Schools for Workers directed by Ms. Smith. This was the hotbed of reform where the future educators (including Eleanor G. Coit, Ernestine Friedmann, Marie Algor, Amy Bruce, Alice Shoemaker and Louise Leonard McLaren) would emerge on the labor scene. Later the name was changed to the American Labor Education Service Inc., which last held a conference on April 28, 1962. labor education had gained a firm foothold in American education by then due to being championed by Ms Smith and her cadre of friends from her Bryn Mawr days in the 1920s.\n\nIn 1933 Harry Hopkins, as adviser to FDR and head of the FERA, borrowed Ms. Smith to set up an educational program for the Administration, which in 1937 became the W.P.A.'s Workers Education Service.\nAs FDR's Educational Specialist, She created and ran multiple programs; one such program employed out-of-work teachers, whose graduates include Hubert H. Humphrey, a future vice president under LBJ. Another set up the She-She-She Camps for unemployed women, ER's bid to place women in the program of Civilian Conservation Corps camps for men, and to provide education and housing for unemployed youth.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt's journal of August 2, 1939 notes her visit to her friend at the school for women she ran during the summer months. She arrived at the Hudson Labor School, at tea time and joined the group of women in the shade of the trees. Hilda Smith owned the property and used it as a summer school for women workers. Eleanor wrote; \"The group was gathered in front of the house under the trees before I arrived and they asked me some interesting questions. \"What did I think they should try to get out of the seven weeks spent on the banks of the Hudson?\" \"How would one go about interesting people in a community in working conditions?\", etc.\n\nThere were two English girls, a German refugee and a Swedish girl at the school that summer. While we were all having tea, I was amused to have one of the English girls say to me: \"What a contrast between what you are able to do and what our Queen is free to do. I wonder if she would not give a great deal to have the same amount of freedom?\" \nShe continued, \"I am sure this school does a great deal to develop the mental abilities of the girls, but I think it is equally valuable because of the health which they acquire, for they do all their studying practically out of doors, eat on the balcony, and swim and play together.\"\n\nER knew the value of this, having championed the work Hilda Smith pioneered in convincing FDR to give up funds for the formation of the She-She-She Camps in 1933 when he as part of the New Deal created the CCC(Civilian Conservation Corps). The camps fell victim to politics and sexism and were closed by 1937, where the twin crises of shelter (200,000 women were\nhomeless in 1933) and hunger plaguing the destitute eased as a result of the new deal programs of FDR.\n\nThe workers' education movement gained momentum, with Worthington Smith playing an active and significant role. In addition to the schools that she was directly involved in founding (such as the Hudson Shore Labor School, which was established on the site of her family home on the Hudson River), she served on the advisory committees of many such initiatives. She also established and served as first Director of the Affiliated Schools for Workers (1927–1939), later known as the American Labor Education Service (1939–1962).\n\nThe later years of Worthington Smith's career were dominated by federal appointments, listed here:\n\nWorthington Smith retired at the age of 83 to focus on various writing projects related to her life experiences and career, including a narrative of her seven years with the Office of Economic Opportunity and a revised and expanded version of her autobiography, Opening Vistas in Workers' Education, which was self-published in 1978. In addition to these publications, Worthington Smith's poetry was published in songbooks, periodicals, and in three printed volumes: Castle of Dream (1910) and Poems (1964), both privately printed, and Selected Poems (1977). She died on March 3, 1984.\n\nTo sum up Jane's life a story done in 1984 for the New York Times does come close to sewing 1919 to 1983 into a fine embroidery. The author noted that in 1937 the programs Smith initiated but couldn't in 1933 call by name became the W.P.A.'s Workers Education Service. When tasked by Harry Hopkins to be education specialist she already knew what she wanted.\n\nSmith also wanted to teach \"workers’ education\", a term that had a strong communist association. She related years later, \"I hardly dared mention it because it was so unpopular.\"\n\n\"Workers'education was ... \"unusual because it involved three groups virtually ignored at the time: women, blue collar workers, and blacks..\"\"—Priscilla Van Tassel, New York Times, June 24, 1984, NJ5. (Caption for HWSmith picture) from the interview for the story in the NYTimes\n\n\"And what is workers' education? I think the first thing is to say what workers' education is and what it is not. I'd like to say, first, it is not vocational education. Many people think that that is what it is; it's not trade training for workers. That's entirely separate, should supplement workers' education and go along with it. But it is not the same thing. Workers' education is a specialized branch of adult education. It covers in general the economic and labor problems related to the experience of industrial workers, office workers, farmers, anything that touches the economic field. It is also and usually supplemented with much work in English, with elementary science, social psychology, with history, with a background of life in the United States. It touches: employers' problems, trade union problems, the worker in the community as citizen, the government's relation to industry and to the labor movement.\"\n\nInterview with Hilda Worthington Smith, Franklin D.

The show replaced CMLL's regularly scheduled \"CMLL Super Viernes\" show as is tradition with most of CMLL's signature events. The 2015 event marked the seventh time CMLL has held a show under that name with previous shows in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Each of the shows were main evented by a multi-man steel cage match, contested under \"Lucha de Apuestas\", or bet match rules referred to as \"Infierno en el Ring\". According to the rules the loser of the match, the last person to remain in the cage, would be forced to have his hair shaved off per \"Lucha Libre\" traditions.\n\nThe main event of the show saw 12 men put their mask on the line in the cage, with Súper Comando ending up being unmasked as a result of his loss. The show was offered as an internet-Pay Per View, but suffered major issues during the first three matches of the show. The show featured five matches in total, including the CMLL debut of Cibernético who worked for CMLL's main rival AAA for over 20 years.\n\nThe Mexican wrestling company \"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\" (Spanish for \"World Wrestling Council\"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker \"Infierno en el Ring\" (\"Inferno in the Ring\"), all of which were main evented by a multi-man steel cage match, the eponymous \"Infierno en el Ring\" match. CMLL has use the \"Infierno en el Ring\" match on other shows, but will intermittently hold a show billed specifically as \"Infierno en el Ring\", with the first such show held in 2008. It is not an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All \"Infierno en el Ring\" shows have been held in Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \"home\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the \"Infierno en el Ring\" shows replace their regularly scheduled \"Super Viernes\" show. For 2015 the show will be held on December 25, part of CMLL's Christmas celebrations. A few days after the press conference it was announced that the show would be available as an Internet Pay Per View both in and outside of Mexico, the second ever Internet PPV promoted by CMLL after the CMLL 82nd Anniversary Show.\n\nThe event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nThe road to the \"Infierno en el RIng\" cage match saw a number of different rivalries either initiate or intensify as the twelve men risking their masks built to the December 25 show. One of the focal points of the match was the storyline rivalry that had developed between the young \"tecnico\" The Panther and the more experienced \"rudo\" Súper Comando during a match on CMLL's \"Super Viernes\" show where The Panther teamed up with Hombre Bala Jr. and Super Halcón Jr. to defeat Súper Comando, his brother Artillero (collectively known as \"Los Hombres del Camoflaje\"; Spanish for \"Men in Camouflage\") and Sangre Azteca by disqualification due to excessive violence from the \"rudo\" team. In subsequent weeks the two face off several times, with Súper Comando using illegal tactics to beat up the Panther and at time tear Panther's mask up.\n\nThe storyline between the third generation of the Casas family, specifically Puma and Tiger and the second generation of the Panther family, Blue Panther Jr. and The Panther, played off the long running rivalry between Negro Casas (Uncle of Puma and Tiger) and Blue Panther, the father of both Panthers. The rivalry between the two families had been going on for years, with the storyline returning to the forefront of CMLL programming in the fall of 2015, expanding the number of wrestlers feuding throughout the fall. In early December CMLL announced that Súper Comando, The Panther, Blue Panther Jr., Puma and TIger would joint 7 other wrestlers, Cancerbero, Esfinge, Fuego, Pegasso, Raziel, Sangre Azteca and Tritón in the main event of the 2015 \"Infierno en el Ring\" show. During a press conference featuring all 12 competitors Puma made reference to Súper Comando being an \"old man\", something the 34-year old Súper Comando objected to, stating that he might have to teach Puma a lesson during the cage match. The week before the cage match all twelve wrestlers faced off in a \"torneo cibernetico\" elimination match, which saw The Panther and Súper Comando face off several times and also saw Súper Comando and Puma clash despite being on the same team. Puma was partially responsible for Súper Comando being eliminated from the match. In the end Puma pinned Tritón to win the match.\n\nThe event was supposed to be broadcast live on internet-Pay Per View but due to technical difficulties the first two matches were not shown at all and the third match was only partially transmitted. During the event CMLL stated on Twitter that the problem was not on their end but with the PPV provide Cleeng. The transmission was reestablished during the third match of the night.\n\nThe third match of the night, between the teams of Máximo Sexy, Super Parka and Valiente fighting against Negro Casas, Kamaitachi and Cavernario ended in a disqualification when Kamaitachi landed an illegal low kick to Máximo Sexy's groin, causing the disqualification in the final fall. Following the match CMLL match makers came to the ring and signed two \"Luchas de Apuestas\" matches for the following week's \"Sin Piedad\" show, Kamaitacho against Máximo Sexy and Super Parka against Negro Casas.\n\n"}

It is celebrated mainly in the Nepalese states of Mithila and Tharuhat, parts of Nepal's Province No. 1, as well as the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand,WestBengal and Uttar Pradesh. Furthermore, it is widely observed by the Eastern Tharu and Far-Eastern Madhesi peoples. In 2016, it was observed on 7th Ashwin of Hindu Bikram Sambat calendar falling on September 23 of Gregorian Calendar.\n\nA three-day long festival is celebrated from the seventh to the ninth lunar day of Krishna Paksha in Ashwin month of Hindu Bikram Sambat that falls generally in September. The first day, the day before Jivitputrika is known as Nahai-khai. On that day, mothers take food only after having their bath. On Jivitputrika day, a strict fast, called \"Khur Jitiya\", is observed without water. On the third day, the fast ends with Paaran, taking the first food of the day. In Mithila , Tharuhat, the region of northeastern Bihar, and eastern Nepal, a variety of food and a special festival delicacy \"Jhor Bhaat\" (curry and white rice), \"Noni ka saag\" and Madua ki Roti are prepared. In the Bhojpuri region of western Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and Nepal, Paaran is done with Noni ka saag (summer purslane), Maruwa ki roti, and a vegetable stew of zucchini. The festival is celebrated mainly in the Bhojpuri and Maithili speaking regions of Nepal and Bihar, Jharkhand and Eastern Uttar Pradesh of India.\n\nIt is believed that once, an eagle and a female fox lived in a Himalayan jungle near Narmada river were friends. Both of them saw some ladies performing the pooja and fasting, and wished to observe it themselves too. During their fast, the fox became unconscious because of hunger and secretly had food. On the other hand, the eagle observed the fast with full dedication and completed it. As a result, all children born to the fox perished a few days after birth and the eagle's offspring were blessed with long life.\n\nAccording to this story Jimutavahana was the wise and king of the Gandharva. Jimutvanhan was not satisfied with ruling and as a result he gave all the responsibilities of his kingdom to his brothers and went to the jungle to serve his father. One day while wandering in the jungle, he finds an old woman mourning. He asked the old woman the reason of weeping, upon which she told him that she belonged to a family of snakes (Nagvanshaki) and had only one son. As an oath, every day, one snake is offered to Pakshiraj Garuda as a feed and that day was her son's chance to become his food. After listening to her problem, Jimutavahana consoled her and promised that he would get back her son alive and would protect him from Garuda. He decides to lay down himself on the bed of rocks being presented to the Garuda for the feed. Garuda comes and holds the Jimutvahana covered with red cloth with his fingers and climbs the rock. Garuda finds it surprising when the person he has trapped does not response. He asks Jimutvahana his identity on which he describes the entire scene to the Garuda. Garuda, pleased with the bravery and the benevolence of Jimutvahana, departs and promises not to take any further sacrifices from the snakes. Due to the bravery and generosity of Jimutvahana, the race of the snakes was saved and since then, the fasts for the children's welfare and long life are observed.\n\n"}

The \"Australi Witness\" persona, had, posing as a Perth jihadist, called for an attack on, and posted maps of, the center where the exhibit was taking place, praised the jihadist attackers in its aftermath, and was retweeted by one of the assailants before the attack. He also claimed credit for the attack.\n\nGoldberg also planned terrorist attacks in Australia.\n\nInitially charged with distributing information about bomb-making techniques in connection with a planned attack on a 2015 Kansas City 9/11 memorial event, Goldberg's trial was suspended pending efforts by doctors to return him to competence after it emerged that he had a history of mental illness.\n\nOn December 20, 2017, Goldberg pleaded guilty to federal charges of attempted malicious damage and destruction by an explosive of a building. On June 25, 2018, Goldberg was sentenced to ten years in federal prison and lifetime supervision.\n\nGoldberg is Jewish. He lived with his parents in Orange Park, Florida, a suburb of Jacksonville.\n\nGoldberg made online posts under a number of different pen names.\n\nAustrali Witness was an online persona, claiming to be an ISIS-affiliated jihadist from Australia, who was described by Rita Katz, executive director of SITE Intelligence Group, as holding a \"prestigious position\" in online jihadi circles.\n\nAustrali Witness urged an attack on the anti-Islamic event being held at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas, on May 3, 2015, suggesting that \"brothers in Texas\" to go there \"with your weapons, bombs or with knifes \" to \"defend your Prophet\". The persona also posted maps to the event. Subsequently, two men, identified as Phoenix, Arizona residents Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi, were shot dead by police as they attempted to attack the contest. The FBI found that Simpson retweeted a message from the Australi Witness Twitter handle on the morning of the attack. Australi Witness claimed credit for having inspired the attack to multiple media outlets, praised Simpson and Soofi as martyrs, and expressed support for the attack in an interview with Fairfax Media.\n\nAustrali Witness posted a 50-page guide online on how to join the terror group ISIS, and later posted a list of synagogues in Australia, ostensibly to encourage his supporters to attack them. He communicated that he was planning an attack in Melbourne to an FBI informant, who posed as a jihadist, and a 17-year-old who pleaded guilty to planning a Mother’s Day 2015 bombing in Melbourne using pressure cooker and pipe bombs, which was never carried out, was found to have been in contact with Goldberg.\n\nAccording to the FBI, Australi Witness posted to an ISIS-related website that he had recruited two people, one in Los Angeles, the other in Melbourne, to \"using guns, shoot up local synagogues when the maximum amount of Jews are praying\", stating that \"the entire thing was my idea, and I helped them every step of the way\".\n\nAustrali Witness also claimed to have worked for Amnesty International, asked followers to target Australian cartoonist Larry Pickering, and repeatedly attempted to associate himself with anti-Islamphobia campaigner Mariam Veiszadeh.\n\nGoldberg reportedly set up a fake account in the name of Australian Muslim preacher Junaid Thorne. Goldberg also created a number of fake jihadist accounts, which interacted with the fake Thorne account, and he then sent screengrabs of the fabricated interactions to journalists, at least one of whom published the fake interaction in an article of \"The West Australian\" in April 2015.\n\nThe fake jihadist personas were also used to besmirch Amnesty International and the Human Rights Law Centre by claiming that the fake jihadists had employment ties, or donated money to, these organizations.\n\nThis persona was linked to Goldberg on Facebook.\n\nGoldberg reportedly set up a fake Twitter account in the name of anti-sexual exploitation campaigner Caitlin Roper, who allegedly earned his ire because of her efforts to get the video game \"Grand Theft Auto V\" banned in Australia. The fake account sent Promoted Tweets that targeted the transgender community.\n\nUnder this persona, Goldberg posed as a female left-wing Australian activist opposed to free speech.\nGoldberg’s work under the persona was published in many places, including Thought Catalog, a Daily Kos diary; and Feministing, a feminist blog.\n\"Wall Street Journal\" columnist James Taranto apologized for believing a hoax allegedly perpetrated by Goldberg under the name \"Tanya Cohen\" earlier in 2015. \"National Review\"s Charles Cooke described the article that Taranto responded to as \"exquisite satire\", while Mike Masnick of Techdirt called it \"...damn good satire, because it's just stupid enough at the beginning to drag you in and make you believe it, and then, slowly but surely, over the course of a very long writeup, it starts tossing out ever more ridiculous ideas -- drip... drip... drip -- that just, gently, turn up the outrage-o-meter, such that many people don't even realize that it's satire.\"\n\nThis persona was linked to Goldberg on Facebook.\n\nOn Reddit, Goldberg made thousands of racist posts under the neo-Nazi persona \"European88.\" Under this persona, Goldberg created and moderated many controversial Reddit communities that were racist in nature, including being a moderator for the \"r/CoonTown\" subreddit. \n\nThe subreddit's creator, who went by \"EugeneNix\", a co-troll of Goldberg, has briefly spoken to \"Taki's Magazine\" about Goldberg and his impressions of him, before and after \"EugeneNix\" learned about his former cohort's ISIL-related endeavors after the latter was arrested.\n\nMany subreddits he created or moderated, including \"r/CoonTown\", were banned during a period when Reddit's content policy was revised in August 2015.\n\nGoldberg posted on the neo-Nazi website \"The Daily Stormer\" as \"Michael Slay\". \n\nOne well-known article by this persona regarding how to recruit people from Reddit (particularly the \"r/conspiracy\" and \"r/Europe\" subreddits), described as \"fertile ground for recruitment\" was commented on by Sam Biddle in a Gawker article.\n\nUpon his arrest and unveiling, the administrator of the site removed his posts.\n\nHe used this persona to criticize Mariam Veiszadeh, writing more than one \"Daily Stormer\" article about her.\n\nIn April 2015, an item was posted on a \"Times of Israel\" blog calling for the extermination of the Palestinian people. The article was ostensibly written by Josh Bornstein, a Jewish Australian lawyer, and triggered widespread condemnation. Bornstein immediately disavowed responsibility for the post, which was deleted by \"The Times of Israel\". It has since been accepted that Bornstein was the victim of a hoax.\n\nInitially, it was believed that the hoax was perpetrated by white supremacists. In May 2015, Bornstein faced online threats from Goldberg's Australi Witness Twitter account, and it was later learned that the hoax post was initially perpetrated by Goldberg.\n\nGoldberg has been identified as the person behind \"Philosophy of Rape\", a subreddit that advocated corrective rape against \"whores and feminazis\", and offered tips on how to do so without getting caught.\n\nGoldberg was also active on Twitter, Reddit, Disqus and others under the username MoonMetropolis, a \"free speech absolutist\" who was involved with the Gamergate controversy. He would frequently use this persona to criticize the works of his other personas such as anti-free speech activist Tanya Cohen, arguing against points that he himself had made.\n\nGoldberg also posted strong opinions on the subject of free speech absolutism to the website Thought Catalog, using both the MoonMetropolis name and his own name.\n\nNews reports about the Australi Witness online persona calling for the Garland attack first brought the account to the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Australian Federal Police (AFP) alerted the FBI about the real identity of Australi Witness, with the AFP, in turn, being handed the information by two Australian journalists, Luke McMahon and Elise Potaka. However, according to the FBI affidavit filed in court, by the time they received this information from the AFP, their investigation into Goldberg was already well underway. McMahon and Potaka independently tracked and identified the person behind the Australi Witness account after he impersonated Potaka on Facebook, leading to a chain of events which connected Australi Witness to Goldberg. The FBI also directly linked Australi Witness to Goldberg via his IP address.\n\nAustrali Witness passed specific information on the manufacture of a bomb targeting a September 11 memorial event in Kansas City, Missouri to an FBI informant, who was posing as a Muslim extremist. According to the FBI, Australi Witness suggested that the informant bomb the memorial in Kansas City after the latter claimed to live near that city, and also encouraged the informant to make the bomb more deadly by adding rat poison to the shrapnel. \"Australi Witness\" posted pictures online of what he claimed to be a bomb he was building and emailed BBC journalist Mike Wendling claiming credit for the Curtis Culwell Center attack, and warning that a pressure cooker bomb would be detonated in a \"large Midwestern US city\" on September 11, 2015.\n\nGoldberg was arrested by the FBI after being identified as Australi Witness on September 9, 2015. After a raid on his home by the FBI, Goldberg allegedly admitted to agents that he had distributed the information about making the bomb in Kansas City. Goldberg appeared in court on September 15, where he was ordered to undergo a 30-day mental health evaluation to determine his fitness to stand trial. If tried and convicted, Goldberg could face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nAfter his arrest, it emerged that Goldberg had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia and anxiety disorder. On December 14, 2015, after an examination by prison psychologist Lisa Feldman at Federal Detention Center, Miami, US Magistrate Judge James Klindt ruled Goldberg mentally incompetent to stand trial and Goldberg was ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment for four months at the Federal Medical Center, Butner. Goldberg again appeared before Klindt on June 15, 2016, and was described by prison psychiatrists as \"improving\", and that there was a \"good chance\" of him being returned to competency to stand trial. Another status update was scheduled by Klindt for October 15, 2016. Goldberg's lawyer, Paul Shorstein, later claimed that Goldberg had Asperger's Syndrome and had been diagnosed with clinical depression. Goldberg's defense subsequently claimed that Goldberg had autism, actually wanted to be a journalist, and had made \"impressive\" journalistic progress in his trolling activities.\n\nOn 20 December 2017, Goldberg pleaded guilty to attempted malicious damage and destruction by an explosive of a building, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida. According to the plea agreement, Goldberg also claimed to have been planning a terrorist attack in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nOn June 25, Goldberg was sentenced to ten years at the Federal Correctional Complex, Butner in Butner, North Carolina, followed by lifetime supervised release. \n\n\n"}

It is one of several large annual Eisteddfodau in Wales. Singers and dancers from around the world are invited to take part in over 20 competitions followed each evening by concerts on the main stage. Over five thousand singers, dancers and instrumentalists from around 50 countries perform to audiences of more than 50,000 over the 6 days of the event.\n\nFamous performers at Llangollen have included Luciano Pavarotti (who first competed in Llangollen in 1955 with his father and a choir from their home town Modena, and for whom the Eisteddfod's principal trophy – the Choir of the World Pavarotti Trophy – is named), Red Army Ensemble, Julian Lloyd Webber and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. The final Sunday Evening Gala Concert has featured Katherine Jenkins, Bryn Terfel, Kiri Te Kanawa, James Galway and Montserrat Caballe.\n\nThe origins of the International Eisteddfod go back to 1943 when Harold Tudor, an officer of the British Council, arranged a visit for members of governments-in-exile to the Welsh National Eisteddfod in Bangor. The excursion was well received especially by the noted writer and poet Juraj Slavik, the Minister for the Interior in the Czechoslovakia Government in Exile. Following the visit he wrote to Tudor praising the value of music as a way of healing the effects of War. The following year an international concert was held as part of the Llandybie National Eisteddfod.\n\nTowards the end of 1945 Tudor proposed that an international choral festival be added to the 1947 Welsh National Eisteddfod, however the Council of the National Eisteddfod felt that as all their effort were involved in rebuilding their own organisation they could not take on such a scheme. Tudor modified his proposal into an independent music festival and found support for this idea from W. S. Gwynn Williams, Welsh composer and music publisher and George Northing, a teacher from Dinas Brân County School and chairman of Llangollen town council. Gwynn Williams and Northing both pressed for the Eisteddfod to be in their home town of Llangollen.\n\nThe public gave support to this idea at two public meetings in May 1946 but concerns were also raised about who would come, where the event would be held and how the event would be financed.\nThe British Council offered to help find choirs from Europe and to give financial support however the town decided to raise the money through a public subscription and quickly gathered over £1100.\nGeorge Northing was made director of the executive board; Gwynn Williams became music director; Harold Tudor was Director of Publicity and W. Clayton Russon, a local businessman and High Sheriff of Merionethshire became President.\n\nPlans to hold the event on the school field of Dinas Bran County School progressed throughout 1946-47. Accommodation for the overseas competitors would be in houses in the town and surrounding area and domestic participants would be given beds in church and school halls. As rationing was still in place ration coupons had to be found for all the visitors and the Minister of Food was eventually persuaded to supply these.\n\nWhen in June 1947 it was time for competitors to travel to Llangollen a railway strike had started in France and there were serious doubt as to whether any overseas competitors would be able to arrive. Considerable relief was felt by the organisers when the first coach of competitors arrived bringing the ladies’ choir Grupo Musical Feminino from Oporto. They were the eventual winners of the Ladies Competition whilst the Men's competition was won by the Hungarian workers’ choir, who had completed their journey to Wales by hitch-hiking when their train had been cancelled at Basle because of the French strike.\n\nThe Esperanto Society played a significant part in the first year when it was felt that there could be a shortage of participants. Reto Rossetti, a well-known figure and author in the Esperanto movement, was asked to help and through publicity in Esperanto magazines and to the surprised of the organisers, several groups contacted the Eisteddfod committee. Two troupes of Spanish dancers, on a tour of Britain sponsored by the British Council and the Esperanto Society, arrived and despite there not being a dance competition in the first year, performed to delighted audiences. Folk dance competitions have featured in every subsequent Llangollen Eisteddfod.\n\nThe eisteddfod was brought to close by what has now become the traditional Sunday concert featuring Sir John Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra. The 1947 International Eisteddfod was hailed as an unqualified success with praise for the organisers, the founders, and all the competitors. There was even a surplus of £1,432 to be used for the next year's event.\n\nA major test mission to promote reconciliation occurred in 1949, just four years after the end of the war, when a choir from Lübeck came to compete at the Eisteddfod. There had been Austrian and Italian choirs, but they hardly counted; neither did Spaniards. As the choir tell it in a letter now in the Clwyd archive in Ruthin, there was a tearful welcome with tea and sandwiches when the choir arrived at the Llangollen station from the eisteddfod helpers and the townspeople. Later, the festival's compère Mr Hywel Roberts introduced the choir with the words: \"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome our friends from Germany.\" The town organised a concert to help the choir raise funds, and (in 2015) members of the choir still correspond with Llangollen friends.\n\nThe 2007 Eisteddfod included performances by José Carreras, Joan Baez, and Hayley Westenra. In 2008, there were performances by Elaine Paige, All Angels, and Alfie Boe; in 2009, performances by Barbara Dickson, Sir Willard White, Blake, and Natasha Marsh, with a James Bond 007 spectacular, featuring the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera, as the Sunday finale; 2010 saw performances by Katherine Jenkins and Nigel Kennedy. In 2011 there were concerts featuring Lulu, Russell Watson, Faryl Smith, Ruthie Henshaw and McFly.\n\nIn 2012 the Eisteddfod played host to Lesley Garrett, Alison Balsom, Nicola Benedettii and Sian Edwards in a celebration concert for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. There were also appearances by Alfie Boe, Steffan Morris, and Valentina Nafornta, and a performance of Karl Jenkins's new work \"The Peacemakers\" by a specially formed massed choir accompanied by the Llangollen International Eisteddfod Orchestra. The week was rounded off by the Grand Finale Concert, featuring Fflur Wyn, Wynne Evans, Mark Llewelyn Evans, John Owen-Jones and Richard Balcombe.\n\nIn recent years the Sunday evening concert has been given over to more \"popular\" music. Starting with McFly in 2011, subsequent concerts have included UB40, Status Quo (band), and Manic Street Preachers.\n\nA parade is usually held on the Tuesday of the Eisteddfod week, in which both the locals and visitors, take part dancing, singing, and playing musical instruments, whilst marching the streets of Llangollen. However, in 2016 the parade was moved to the Friday to enable more competitors to take part.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18673061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18673061", "title": "Mexican miracle", "text": "Mexican miracle\n\nThe term Mexican miracle is used in common speech, but not by economists, to refer to the country's inward-looking development strategy that produced sustained economic growth of 3 to 4 percent and modest 3 percent inflation annually from the 1940s until the 1970s.\n\nAn important factor helping sustained growth in the period 1940–1970 was the reduction of political turmoil, particularly around national elections, with the creation of a single, dominant party. In 1946, the party founded by Plutarco Elías Calles in the wake of President-elect Álvaro Obregón's assassination in 1928 changed its name to the Institutional Revolutionary Party. With the party's presidential choice in 1946, Miguel Alemán Valdés, Mexico elected its first civilian president since Francisco I. Madero in 1911. The subsequent elections of Adolfo Ruiz Cortines (1952–58) and Adolfo López Mateos (1958–64), Gustavo Díaz Ordaz (1964–70) there were no political opposition challenges to the government's implementation of economic programs.\n\nDuring the presidency of Lázaro Cárdenas, there were significant policies in the social and political spheres that had impacts on future economic policies in Mexico, in particular nationalization of oil in 1938, as well as land reform, and nationalization of railways. Cárdenas was succeeded by the politically more moderate Manuel Ávila Camacho, who initiated a program of industrialization in early 1941 with the Law of Manufacturing Industries. One scholar has called the inaugural date of this law \"the birthday of the Institutional Revolution,\" since it was the inception of import-substitution industrialization. Further legislation in 1946 under President Miguel Alemán Valdés, the Law for Development of New and Necessary Industries, was passed.\n\n\"In the long view, some of the permanent alterations in Mexico from World War II were economic.\" Mexico benefited significantly during World War II, by its participation on the side of the Allies. Mexico supplied labor to the U.S. via the Bracero Program, but its most significant contribution was in its supply of material to fight the war. It received cash payments for its material contributions, which meant that following the war the Mexican treasury had robust reserves. Although a participant in the war, like the U.S., Mexico was not a site of combat, so that in the post-war era, Mexico did not need to rebuild damaged infrastructure. However, with the resources available following the war, Mexico embarked on big infrastructure projects.\n\nÁvila Camacho used part of the accumulated savings to pay off foreign debts, so that Mexico's credit standing substantially improved (increasing investors' confidence in the government). With increased revenues coming from the war effort, the government was now in a position to distribute material benefits from the Revolution more widely; he used funds to subsidize food imports that especially affected urban workers. Workers in Mexico received higher salaries during the war, but there was a lack of consumer goods to purchase, so that workers had both personal savings and pent up demand for goods. A key government institution for development, founded under Lázaro Cárdenas's administration was \"Nacional Financiera\" (abbreviated \"Nafin\"), the national development bank, which funded the expansion of the industrial sector. \n\nGrowth was sustained by the government's increasing commitment to primary education for the general population from the late 1920s through the 1940s. The enrollment rates of the country's youth increased threefold during this period; consequently when this generation was employed by the 1940s their economic output was more productive. Mexico also made investments in higher education that created a generation of scientists, social scientists, and engineers, who enabled Mexican industrial innovation. The founding of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional (\"IPN\") in 1936 as a government-funded institution in the northern part of Mexico City, trained a new generation of Mexicans. In northern Mexico, the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, known in Mexico as the \"Tec de Monterrey\" was founded by northern industrialists in 1942, with the programs designed by a former faculty member of the IPN and modeled after the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From a small, private inception, the Tec de Monterrey built a major campus inaugurated by President Alemán in 1946, and has been a magnet for students from other areas of Latin America.\n\nIn the years following World War II, President Miguel Alemán Valdés (1946–52) instituted a full-scale import-substitution program which stimulated output by boosting internal demand. The government raised import controls on consumer goods but relaxed them on capital goods (such as machinery for Mexican production of consumer goods), which it purchased with international reserves accumulated during the war. The government spent it heavily on infrastructure, including major dam projects to produce hydroelectric power, supply drinking water to cities and irrigation water to agriculture, and control flooding. By 1950 Mexico's road network had expanded to 21,000 kilometers, of which some 13,600 were paved.\n\nThe economic stability of the country, high credit rating allowing borrowing, an increasingly educated work force, and savings allowing purchase of consumer goods were excellent conditions for the government's program of import substitution industrialization. Finished goods previously purchased abroad could be produced domestically with the purchase of machinery. One successful industry was textile production. Foreign transnational companies established branches in Mexico, such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, and Sears (Mexico) under Mexican laws regulating foreign investment. The automotive industry in Mexico already had been established shortly after the end of the military phase of the Mexican Revolution, with Buick became the first automobile producer to be officially established in Mexico in 1921. In 1925, Ford Motor Company was too established and began manufacturing vehicles in the country. With a growing middle class consumer market for such expensive consumer goods, the industrial base of Mexico expanded to meet the demand. \n\nThe government fostered the development of consumer goods industries directed toward domestic markets by imposing high protective tariffs and other barriers to imports. The share of imports subject to licensing requirements rose from 28 percent in 1956 to an average of more than 60 percent during the 1960s and about 70 percent in the 1970s. Industry accounted for 22 percent of total output in 1950, 24 percent in 1960, and 29 percent in 1970. The share of total output arising from agriculture and other primary activities declined during the same period, while services stayed constant.\n\nThe government promoted industrial expansion through public investment in agricultural, energy, and transportation infrastructure. Cities grew rapidly during these years, reflecting the shift of employment from agriculture to industry and services. The urban population increased at a high rate after 1940. Growth of the urban labor force exceeded even the growth rate of industrial employment, with surplus workers taking low-paying service jobs.\n\nMexico's strong economic performance continued into the 1960s, when GDP growth averaged about 7 percent overall and about 3 percent per capita. Consumer price inflation averaged only 3 percent annually. Manufacturing remained the country's dominant growth sector, expanding 7 percent annually and attracting considerable foreign investment. \n\nMining grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent, trade at 6 percent, and agriculture at 3 percent. By 1970 Mexico had diversified its export base and become largely self-sufficient in food crops, steel, and most consumer goods. Although its imports remained high, most were capital goods used to expand domestic production.\n\n\n"}

Held at Enzo Ferrari Park, the event broke the world record for the most successful ticketed concert, with a total of 225,173 tickets sold (including 5,000 free tickets).\n\nThe last concert performed by Vasco in Modena dates back to 22 September 2001 during the Festa nazionale de l'Unità, on his \"Stupido Hotel\" tour.\n\nOn 19 April 2016, Vasco announced the organization of a concert in Modena, the city where he began his 40-year career as a DJ and singer. Initially, the event was to be called \"Modena... Modena park tutto ritorna\" (Modena... Modena Park all is back), in reference to lyrics of his song \"Colpa d'Alfredo\" (\"Alfredo's fault\"), in which a girl asks Vasco, \"Mi puoi portare a casa questa sera? Abito fuori Modena, Modena park\" (\"Can you bring me home tonight? I'm living out of Modena... Modena Park\"), but then she goes out with another man \"who does not even speak Italian well, but – you see – he is well understood whenever he wants\".\n\nOn 25 January 2017 ticket sales were opened to fan club members, who bought 33,112 tickets in 48 hours, and then two days later to the general public. On 27 January alone 150,000 tickets were sold in 10 hours, and at 8:13 PM Vasco announced on Twitter that he \"Pulverized the European record!\" The final block of 25,000 tickets was put on sale on 23 May, selling out within three hours.\n\nThe concert began at 9:00 PM and included 40 songs by Vasco (one for each year of his career). The event ended after three and a half hours and concluded with the 1979 single \"Albachiara\" and a fireworks show.\n\nProgram:\n\nThe stage at Enzo Ferrari park was long and stood off the ground. It featured five large video screens with a total area of . Four of these were set on tracks, so that they could move sideways depending on the video scenography required during each song. The remaining four screens, two per side, were installed within PIT 3. Special effects were produced by 2,100 light points and 140 lasers. Transportation of all the staging equipment required a total of 136 semi-trailer trucks.\n\nThe sound was played through a 750,000-watt L-Acoustics audio system consisting of 900 speaker modules connected by of fiber optic cables, with 29 sound towers to allow all 230,000 viewers along a -long lawn to listen without return or echo effects. According to production staff, one megawatt of energy was consumed during the concert. The two main towers located in front of the stage, each containing 80 speaker modules, were suspended using two-ton cranes for each tower.\n\nOver 220,000 tickets to the concert were sold, beating the previous world record of 198,000 paying attendees at the a-Ha concert at the Rock in Rio 2 festival on 26 January 1991. The arena was split into three areas: Pits 1 and 2 accommodated 30,000 attendees each, and Pit 3 seated the remainder. The areas were marked with different colours (red, blue, and green), and with different ticket prices (€75, €65, and €50, pre-sale fees and commissions excluded). The total gross for the concert was about €12 million (USD$13.7 million), while the economic impact on the city was estimated at €6 million.\n\nGate opening was initially scheduled for 9:00 AM on 1 July. However, considering the crowd that had arrived on the previous day, the police ordered the gates opened at 9:00 PM on 30 June, twenty-four hours before the concert began. One fan from Pordenone began camping in Modena on 29 May, a full month prior, in order to be the first person to enter the park.\n\nThe national railroad company Trenitalia scheduled three special long-distance trains to depart from Rome, Turin/Milan, and Venice for the Modena railway station. After the concert, more than 35 trains were scheduled to depart. It was estimated that about 35,000 people reached Modena by train.\n\nThe concert was broadcast live under the title \"Vasco Modena Park 01.07.17 – Live\". Directed by Giuseppe Domingo Romano credited as Pepsy Romanoff, it was shown in 197 movie theaters in Italy and three sports venues (Genoa, Padua, and Rome). The concert was followed by official radio re-broadcasts on Radio Dimensione Suono and Radio Italia (at the national level), and Radio Bruno (at the local level). National television company RAI, unable to acquire the broadcasting rights for all the songs, aired on Eurovision on Rai 1 and Rai 1 HD the special program \"La notte di Vasco\" (\"Vasco's night\") by Paolo Bonolis, in addition to the programming of Rai Radio 2.\n\nPepsy Romanoff announced that the filming of the concert would be remastered in a live action film to be shown in Italian theaters at the beginning of December 2017 during the Christmas season, while the release of the DVD was scheduled for March–April 2018. For reasons of length (the documentary lasts 157 minutes, while the Modena concert was 3 and a half hours), several songs have been cut. In the five days of programming, the documentary was watched by 49,409 spectators and grossed €687.435, which exceeded the total revenue of the nine most scheduled films on the same day in Italy, and reached second place on the weekly chart of the most popular shows of the week. Afterwards, box office revenues rose to €743.153, between USD$848,058 and USD$849,124, against an estimated production budget of €500,000.\n\n\n"}

The Mongolia Charity Rally is organised by Charity Rallies, part of Go Help, a UK-based charity.\n\nParticipants start the trip from a Mongolian Naadam festival in London, England. The vehicles are then driven to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, where they are donated to a partner charity of Go Help for auction. Charity Ralliers must raise a minimum of £1,500 for Go Help, the registered UK charity that runs Charity Rallies, through Go Help's Justgiving page, before departing. The main beneficiary of the 2008 and 2009 Mongolia Charity Rally was Save the Children.\n\nThe Mongolia Charity Rally launches from Highbury Fields in Islington, London. Go Help and the Mongolian Association organise a Mongolian Naadam to see Charity Ralliers off on their adventure, an event that is heavily attended by the Mongolian community in London, and was featured on ITV Local, a UK television network.\n\nThe main routes to Mongolia are either the Northern Route, from London to Mongolia via Moscow, or the Southern Route, via Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Russia.\n\nThe Mongolia Charity Rally charges an entry fee that is aimed at covering the costs of running the event. All excess funds that are generated from entry fees are donated to a project started by Go Help that provides riding helmets to child jockeys taking part in Mongolian Naadam festivals, a project that was covered by Mongolian television in 2008. The entry fee for the Mongolia Charity Rally 2010 is £300 for teams signing up before October 1, after which the invitation is by invitation only. The entry fee for 2009 was also £300, which is less than half the entry fee of £650 charged in 2009 by a competing rally run by a profit making company. The 2008 entry fee was £150. The increase reflected two major additions to Go Help's budget: the hiring of an employee in Mongolia to oversee vehicle sales and to monitor the application of funds raised by Charity Ralliers, and the costs of full-time development of the Charity Rallies website.\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, smuggling and illegal importation of drugs are common. Substandard and counterfeit drugs are then not only sold in these countries but also exported or re-exported. According to the World Customs Organization, counterfeit drugs are a $200 billion a year industry. \n\nIn response to a meningitis epidemic in Niger from February to May 1995 (41, 000 cases reported), the Niger authorities organized an extensive vaccination campaign. In March 1995, Niger received a donation of 88,000 Pasteur Mérieux and SmithKline Beecham vaccines from neighboring Nigeria. A Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) team working with local health authorities noticed that the vaccines from Nigeria had an unusual appearance and inquiries were made. Pasteur Mérieux laboratories confirmed that the batch numbers and the expiration dates did not correspond to their manufacturing records. The drugs supplied by these companies had been substituted with counterfeit drugs. Tests carried out found no traces of active product, which confirmed that they were false. Bottles and labels were, however, copied to perfection. According to estimates, around 60,000 persons were inoculated with false vaccines out of a total 5 million vaccinated during the campaign.\n"}

On December 13, 2016, it was announced that WGN had cancelled the show after three seasons, with the final episode airing on January 25, 2017.\n\nThe series stars Janet Montgomery as Mary Sibley, a powerful witch who controls the Salem witch trials by exacerbating hysteria among the Puritans while executing her plan of summoning the Devil. Problems arise when her long lost love, John Alden (played by Shane West), returns to Salem, complicating Mary's plans. The show has prominent elements of Gothic romance.\n\nThe series first appeared as part of WGN America's development slate in July 2012, under the title \"Malice\". On June 4, 2013, WGN America bypassed the pilot stage and placed a series order for 13 episodes, under the new title \"Salem\". On November 8, 2013, filming of the series began in Shreveport, Louisiana, on an expansive set reflecting 17th-century Massachusetts. On May 15, 2014, \"Salem\" was renewed for a 13-episode second season by WGN America. On July 11, 2015, \"Salem\" was renewed for a 10-episode third season by WGN America.

Neil Genzlinger of the New York Times, upon reviewing the first season, said the show is \"brash and well executed... perversely entertaining\". He went on to say that \"when 'Salem' isn’t being deliberately outrageous, it's cultivating a dynamic that could be fruitful as things move along. Here in the 21st century, science and reason rule, but in a world of sorcery, clinging to rationality just makes you stupid.\" Mark Dawidziak of Plain Dealer gave the first few episodes a positive review, saying \"Slowly drawing you into its heightened version of that Puritan community, 'Salem' casts its spell with an opening episode that is a witch's brew of romance, fear, deceit, revenge, hysteria, evil and uncertainty.\"\n\nThe series premiere rose to 3.4 million viewers in Live+7 ratings, and had more than 1.5 million viewers in adults 18–49.

In its original form, the confidence trickster tells his victim (the \"mark\") that he is (or is in correspondence with) a wealthy person of high estate who has been imprisoned in Spain under a false identity. Some versions had the imprisoned person being an unknown or remote relative of the mark. Supposedly the prisoner cannot reveal his identity without serious repercussions, and is relying on a friend (the confidence trickster) to raise money to secure his release. In this classic pigeon drop game archetype, the confidence trickster offers to let the mark put up some of the funds, with a promise of a greater monetary reward upon release of the prisoner plus a non-pecuniary incentive, gaining the hand of a beautiful woman represented to be the prisoner's daughter. After the mark has turned over the funds, he is informed further difficulties have arisen, and more money is needed. With such explanations, the trickster continues to press for more money until the victim is cleaned out, or declines to put up more funds.\n\nKey features of the Spanish Prisoner trick are the emphasis on secrecy and the trust the confidence trickster apparently places in the mark not to reveal the prisoner's identity or situation. The confidence trickster will typically claim to have chosen the mark carefully, based on his reputation for honesty and straight dealing, and may appear to structure the deal so that the confidence trickster's ultimate share of the reward will be distributed voluntarily by the mark.\n\nModern variants of the Spanish Prisoner fraud include the advance-fee scam, in particular the Nigerian money transfer (or 419) scam. In the advance-fee fraud, a valuable item must be ransomed from a warehouse, crooked customs agent, or lost-baggage facility before the authorities or thieves recognize its value. In the Nigerian variation, a self-proclaimed relative of a deposed African dictator offers to transfer millions of ill-gotten dollars into the bank account of the victim in return for small initial payments to cover bribes and other expenses. More recent examples feature people sharing the same surname as the intended victim, with the scammer guessing the surname from observing patterns in e-mail addresses, or obtaining full names from harvested email headers. Another variation spreads via hijacked Facebook accounts, where a message is sent to all the Facebook friends of the victim, claiming that the victim is in a foreign country, has been robbed, and needs one of the Facebook friends to \"send money\" via Western Union to pay hotel and travel bills.\n\nSneaky Pete, Season 1, Episode 6.

American publicist Georges Obolensky also called it the Gang of Eight. \nThe coup ultimately failed, with the provisional government collapsing by 22 August 1991 and several of the conspirators being prosecuted by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe eight members were:\n\nPugo committed suicide via gunshot to avoid arrest, while the other seven members were arrested.\n\nThe 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt, occurring between 19–21 August 1991, was an attempt by the Gang of Eight to take control of the country from then President of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev. The Gang of Eight were hard-line members of the Communist Party (CPSU) who were opposed to Gorbachev's reform program and the new union treaty he had negotiated, which dispersed much of the central government's power to the republics. The coup collapsed after only two days, and although Gorbachev was restored as President, his authority was irreparably damaged and he became less influential outside of Moscow. The event destabilized the Soviet Union and many speculate that it played a role in both the demise of the CPSU and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After the coup failed, the seven living members of the Gang of Eight were arrested.\n\nOn December 15, 1992, over a year after the attempted coup, the Prosecutor General sent the criminal case against the Gang of Eight to the Military Collegiate of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. Anatoliy Ukolov, a deputy chairman of the Collegiate, was charged with reviewing the case, and the hearing was scheduled for 26 January 1993. The defendants included the aforementioned seven living members of the group plus Oleg Shenin (1937–2009), Politbureau and secretariat member; Anatoly Lukyanov (b. 1930), Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; and Valentin Varennikov (1923–2009), General of the Army, Deputy Minister of Defense, and Commander of Land Forces.\n\nThe trials lasted more than ten months, from 14 April 1993 until 1 March 1994. They were open to the public and press; however, foreign press did not participate due to lack of space in the courtroom. A prosecution commission was assigned to the case by the Collegiate, consisting of nine people and headed by Denisov, a Deputy Prosecutor General. The defense attorneys, Genri Reznik (Shenin), Genrikh Padva, Yuriy Ivanov (Kryuchkov), and Dmitriy Shteinberg (Varennikov) were hired, but in total, there were seventeen defense attorneys. After various delay tactics staged by the defense, the trial began on 30 November 1993. The main prosecutors were Yazov, Kryuchkov, Shenin, and Varennikov.\n\nOn 23 February 1994, the State Duma issued an amnesty to the defense, and on 1 March 1994, the case was closed with all ten defendants accepting amnesty. Varennikov requested amnesty on the condition that Mikhail Gorbachev would be the next to be prosecuted, as he accused Gorbachev of creating the recent political disorder. The court rejected his petition, and upon Varennikov sending his request to the Prosecutor General's office, it was rejected again.\n\nTen days after the close, the Presidium of the Supreme Court revived the prosecution, ruling that procedural infringements regarding the amnesty had occurred. The Presidium arranged a new hearing and assigned a new judge, Viktor Aleksandrovich Yaskin. He conducted the case review using revised court procedures. Yaskin offered the defendants amnesty, and all but Varennikov accepted it. Varennikov was acquitted on the argument that he was following the orders of Minister of Defense.\n\nKryuchkov, Yazov, Shenin, and Pavlov were named as the main conspirators.\n\nPugo committed suicide, together with his wife. However, some sources speculate that he may have been murdered.\n\nYazov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, a prison in northern Moscow. According to the magazine \"Vlast\" No. 41(85) of 14 October 1991, he contacted the President from jail with a recorded video message, in which he repented and called himself \"an old fool\". Yazov denies ever doing that, and he also accepted the amnesty offered by the Russians stating that he was not guilty. He was dismissed from military service by the Presidential Order, and at his discharge, was awarded a ceremonial weapon. He was also awarded an order of honor by the President of Russian Federation. Yazov works as a military adviser at the General Staff Academy.\n\nVarennikov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, refused to accept the offered amnesty, and was eventually found not guilty to the Russians. Prior to the formation of the Gang of Eight, Varennikov participated in the January Events, an attempt to capture the TV-station in Vilnius, Lithuania. According to Gorbachev's aide, Anatoly Chernyaev, Varennikov personally made the decision to use force against the Lithuanians, without discussion with the President. Varennikov was a people's deputy, starting in 1995 and until his death. In 2008, he publicly stated that the military force used during the 1991 coup attempt was intended for security purposes, including the protection of Yeltsin. Varennikov died in 2009 and was buried in Moscow.\n\nBaklanov spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina, and then accepted amnesty in 1994, stating that he was not guilty. He later worked as a director of \"Rosobshchemash\".\n\nYanayev spent 18 months in Matrosskaya Tishina. He later became a chairman of the department of national history at the Russian International Academy of Tourism.\n\nPavlov had been taken to a hospital during the coup with the diagnosis of hypertension, but on 29 August 1991, he was transferred to Matrosskaya Tishina. He accepted amnesty stating that he was not guilty, and later became the head of the Chasprombank. Pavlov resigned from the bank on 31 August 1995, and six months later the bank was left without license. Afterwards he was an adviser at Promstroibank, today known as Bank VTB. Pavlov died in 2003 after a series of heart attacks and was buried in Moscow.\n\nAccording to Vzglyad, Anatoliy Ukolov, the original person charged with the prosecution of the Gang of Eight, blamed the occurrence of the 1991 coup attempt on Gorbachev, implying that the leader should not have taken a vacation at the time. However, in an interview with Komsomol Pravda, Ukolov also mentioned how the members of GKChP chose not to follow the letter of law, but rather to take the situation into their own hands.\n\n"}

The Canadian Air Force pilot and the U.S. Navy passenger, who was taking photographs of the ship, reportedly suffered eye pain and injuries consistent with laser exposure. However, subsequent investigations into the incident were unable to verify that any lasing had occurred.\n\nResponding to a request based on previous suspicious activity of the \"Kapitan Man\", the Canadian Forces dispatched a CH-124 helicopter to fly by the ship and take photographs of it and its abnormal aerial antenna structure, which was indicative of a ship that could be conducting ELINT or SIGINT activities. The U.S. Coast Guard had previously confiscated submarine surveillance equipment from the ship in 1993. At the time of the incident, the \"Kapitan Man\" was north of Port Angeles, Washington i.e. inside U.S. territorial waters.\n\nOn board the aircraft were U.S. Navy Lieutenant Jack Daly and Canadian Forces pilot Captain Patrick Barnes. Lt. Daly was the Navy's foreign-intelligence liaison officer in Esquimalt, British Columbia, heading a joint U.S.-Canadian helicopter-surveillance operation against Russian, Chinese, and other spy ships operating in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which separates the Canadian province of British Columbia from the U.S. state of Washington, and in Puget Sound, the site of major U.S. nuclear ballistic missile submarine and aircraft carrier bases with the Royal Canadian Navy Pacific Fleet Headquarters in Esquimalt Harbour near Victoria, B.C.\n\nWhile taking photographs of the ship and its bridge, Lt. Daly suddenly experienced intense pain in his right eye as well as temporary blindness. After examination, it was concluded that Daly suffered direct laser burns to his right eye, as well as other vision problems and severe headaches. Daly testified that Capt. Barnes was also injured in a similar manner and was permanently grounded as a result of this incident, he has since lost all his flight qualifications. A United States Army Medical Research Department analysis indicated that the crew was most likely hit with a .\n\nIn February 1999, Daly testified before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee about his experience. He said that he and Capt. Barnes both had extreme sensitivity to sunlight and light sources. Driving at night became impossible as did watching movies or night ball games: \"The only form of even momentary relief that either one of us can rely on is sitting in the dark with our eyes closed, yet lately even that does not seem to help much.\" In the same time period, he discussed his case on the ABC News program \"20/20\", saying \"I've been in constant pain since the 4th of April '97, without a moment's relief.\"\n\nShortly after the incident, U.S. Coast Guard teams were given two hours to search the vessel but did not locate a laser. Teams were not given full access to the ship, however, and the Clinton administration had warned the Russian government in advance the ship would be searched.\n\nIn October 2002, Daly sued the Russian Far East Shipping Company (FESCO), owner of the \"Kapitan Man\", in federal court. In his opening statement, Daly's lawyer laid out their side of the case. The company's lawyer countered that there was no positive evidence of a laser on the ship. The jury deliberated for a day and ruled that the laser attack could not be linked to FESCO. Daly's lawyer told the press that the case was hampered by U.S. government resistance and unfavorable rulings by the judge.\n\nIn September 2004, the Chief of Naval Operations denied an Inspector General's recommendation that Daly be awarded the Purple Heart (for wounds sustained by opposing forces). Part of the CNO's rejection stated:\n\nThe case was analyzed in the August 2004 \"Archives of Ophthalmology\" by medical laser researchers including Dr. Bruce Stuck, then Director of the U.S. Army Medical Research Detachment of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, responsible for the Army Medical Department's laser and radio frequency radiation biological effects research program. Although the analysis of \"Case 5\" did not explicitly state Daly's name or the military nature of the ship photography, the case description is clearly that of the Strait of Juan de Fuca laser incident.\n\nThe researchers noted the photographer's (Daly's) case history:\nThe Analysis section of the article stated:\n\n"}

Government reports give a total of 24 killed and 54 injured, while survivors report over a hundred killed.\n\nOn 10 September 1984, Sergeant Hermanu, a member of the Community Advisory Non-Commissioned Officer () arrived at As Saadah Mosque in Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, and told the caretaker, Amir Biki, to remove brochures and banners critical of the government. Biki refused this demand, upon which point Hermanu removed them himself; to do so, he reportedly entered the prayer area of the mosque without removing his shoes (a serious violation of mosque etiquette). In response, local residents, led by mosque caretakers Syarifuddin Rambe and Sofwan Sulaeman, burned his motorcycle and attacked Hermanu while he was talking with another officer. The two then arrested Rambe and Sulaeman, as well as another caretaker, Achmad Sahi, and an unemployed man named Muhamad Noor.\n\nTwo days after the arrest, Islamic cleric Abdul Qodir Jaelani gave a sermon against Pancasila at As Saadah mosque. Afterwards, Biki led a protest to the District Military Command office for North Jakarta, where the four prisoners were being held. Along the way, the group's numbers swelled, with estimates ranging between 1,500 and several thousand. Also during the trip, nine members of a Muslim Chinese Indonesian family headed by Tan Kioe Liem were killed by the protestors. The family's store, a pharmacy, was burned to the ground.\n\nOnce at the military command, the group unsuccessfully demanded the release of the prisoners. At roughly 11 p.m. local time (UTC+7), the protestors surrounded the military command. Military personnel from the 6th Air Defence Artillery Battalion opened fire on the protestors. Around midnight, eyewitnesses saw military commander of Jakarta Try Sutrisno and Chief of the Armed Forces Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani supervising the removal of the victims; the corpses were loaded into military trucks and buried in unmarked graves, while the wounded were sent to Gatot Soebroto Military Hospital.\n\nAfter the riots, the military reported that they had been triggered by a man in a fake military uniform who distributed anti-government pamphlets along with 12 other accomplices; it reported having the man in custody. General Hartono Rekso Dharsono was arrested for allegedly inciting the riots. After a four-month trial, he was convicted; he was eventually released in September 1990, after serving five-years jail time.\n\nAfter the riots, at least 169 civilians were allegedly held without warrant. Some were reportedly tortured. The leaders were arrested and tried for subversion, then given long sentences when convicted. Others, including as Amir Biki, were among those killed.\n\nInitial reports suggested 20 dead. Current official records give a total of 24 killed and 54 injured (including the military), while survivors report over a hundred killed. Tanjung Priok residents estimate a total of 400 killed or missing, while other reports suggest up to 700 victims.\n\nWith the influx of human rights movements after the fall of Suharto in 1998, several groups were created to advocate for the rights of the victims, including the 1984 Foundation, the National Solidarity for the 1984 Tanjung Priok Incident (), and the Extended Family for Victims of the Tanjung Priok Incident (; founded by Biki's widow Dewi Wardah and son Beni). These groups pushed for the People's Representative Council (DPR) and National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) to further investigate the massacre; inside the DPR, representatives A.W. Fatwa and Abdul Qodir Jaelani, both previously arrested after the massacre, pressed for further investigation. In 1999, Komnas HAM agreed to investigate the incident, forming the Commission for the Investigation and Examination of Human Rights Violations in Tanjung Priok (KP3T).\n\nThe KP3T consisted mainly of political figures from the previous regime, including former prosecutor general Djoko Sugianto. The resulting report, released in early June 2000, found that there had been no systematic massacre in the incident. This was not well received by the general public. On 23 June 2000, approximately 300 members of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI) attacked the headquarters of Komnas HAM while dressed in white Islamic clothing and green scarves. They broke windows with stones and rattan sticks, outnumbering and overwhelming the security forces. The FPI was upset at the commission's report on the massacre and perceived collusion with the military, arguing that it had ignored actions by the military; it insisted that the commission be abolished. Meanwhile, Minister of Law and Human Rights Yusril Ihza Mahendra wrote that Komnas HAM had seemingly applied double standards when investigating the issue; he said that they seemed more reluctant to investigate the Tanjung Priok incident then they had been in investigating the 1999 East Timorese crisis. Crescent Star Party leader Ahmad Sumargono called the verdict a disappointment to Muslims everywhere.\n\nIn October 2000, Komnas HAM released another report indicating that 23 individuals, including Sutrisno and Moerdani, should be investigated for their involvement; it called for an \"ad hoc\" tribunal to look into the matter further. With President Abdurrahman Wahid calling for further investigation and the impending tribunal, several military officials made contracts of forgiveness (\"islah\") with victims' families; although the islah did not contain admissions of guilt, it did provide for victims to receive a lump sum of Rp. 1.5-2 million (US$200–250). The first islah covered 86 families, as represented by Rambe, while the second covered Biki's family; by 1 March 2001 a number of islah had been made. As a result of the islah, several victims or their families, suggested to investigator M.A. Rachman that charges be dropped. However, investigation continued, wrapping up in July 2003.\n\nUnder international pressure, in 2003 the DPR approved the use of the 2000 human rights law to bring perpetrators of the massacre to trial for crimes against humanity; the trial began in September of that year. Those brought to trial included Colonel Sutrisno Mascung, leader of Platoon II of the Air Defense Artillery Battalion at the time, and 13 subordinates. Higher-ranking officials from the time, including military commander of Jakarta Try Sutrisno and Chief of the Armed Forces Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani, were exempted from prosecution, as were former President Suharto and former Minister of Justice Ismail Saleh. The prosecution was led by Widodo Supriyadi, and Deputy Speaker of the DPR A.M. Fatwa served as a witness for the prosecution. Several officers prosecuted were convicted, while Sriyanto and Pranowo were acquitted. In 2004 the Prosecutor General's office filed an appeal against the acquittals of Sriyanto and Pranowo, but were refused. The convictions were later overturned by the Supreme Court of Indonesia.\n\nAfter the trial it came under fire from human rights groups; German author Fabian Junge argued that \"prosecutors deliberately ignored substantial evidence while scare-tactics and bribery were rampant outside court\". Approaching the 25th anniversary of the massacre, the victims, aided by the Human Rights Working Group and the Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence, sent a letter to UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers Gabriela Carina Knaul de Albuquerque e Silva imploring her to intervene in the case; the survivors have also requested compensation in the amount of Rp1.015 billion (US$130,000) from the government for their \"pain and loss\". Although victims and their representatives have asked President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to further investigate the issue, the case has not come to closure.\n\n"}

{"id": "26229748", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26229748", "title": "Tyranny of small decisions", "text": "Tyranny of small decisions\n\nThe tyranny of small decisions is a phenomenon explored in an essay of the same name, published in 1966 by the American economist Alfred E. Kahn. The article describes a situation in which a number of decisions, individually small in size and time perspective, cumulatively result in an outcome which is not optimal nor desired. It is a situation where a series of small, individually rational decisions can negatively change the context of subsequent choices, even to the point where desired alternatives are irreversibly destroyed. Kahn described the problem as a common issue in market economics which can lead to market failure. The concept has since been extended to areas other than economic ones, such as environmental degradation, political elections and health outcomes.\n\nA classic example of the tyranny of small decisions is the tragedy of the commons, described by Garrett Hardin in 1968 as a situation where a number of herders graze cows on a commons. The herders each act independently in what they perceive to be their own rational self-interest, ultimately depleting their shared limited resource, even though it is clear that it is not in any herder's long-term interest for this to happen.\n\nThe event that first suggested the tyranny of small decisions to Kahn was the withdrawal of passenger railway services in Ithaca, New York. The railway was the only reliable way to get in and out of Ithaca. It provided services regardless of conditions, in fair weather and foul, during peak seasons and off-peak seasons. The local airline and bus company skimmed the traffic when conditions were favourable, leaving the trains to fill in when conditions were difficult. The railway service was eventually withdrawn, because the collective individual decisions made by travellers did not provide the railway with the revenue it needed to cover its incremental costs. According to Kahn, this suggests a hypothetical economic test of whether the service should have been withdrawn.\nSuppose each person in the cities served were to ask himself how much he would have been willing to pledge regularly over some time period, say annually, by purchase of prepaid tickets, to keep rail passenger service available to his community. As long as the amount that he would have declared (to himself) would have exceeded what he actually paid on the period–and my own introspective experiment shows that it would–then to that extent the disappearance of the passenger service was an incident of market failure.\nThe failure to reflect the full value to passengers of keeping the railroad service available had its origins in the discrepancy between the time perception within which the travellers were operating, and the time perception within which the railroad was operating. The travellers were making many short term decisions, deciding each particular trip whether to go by the railroad, or whether to go instead by car, bus or the local airline. Based on the cumulative effects of these small decisions, the railroad was making one major long run decision, \"virtually all-or-nothing and once-and-for-all\"; whether to retain or abandon its passenger service. Taken one at a time, each small travel decision made individually by the travellers had a negligible impact on the survivability of the railroad. It would not have been rational for a traveller to consider the survival of the railroad imperilled by any one of his particular decisions.\n\nThe fact remains that each selection of x over y constitutes also a vote for eliminating the \"possibility thereafter of choosing y\". If enough people vote for x, each time necessarily on the assumption that y will continue to be available, y may in fact disappear. And its disappearance may constitute a genuine deprivation, which customers might willingly have paid something to avoid. The only choice the market offered travellers to influence the longer-run decision of the railroad was thus shorter in its time perspective, and the sum total of our individual purchases of railroad tickets necessary added up to a smaller amount, than our actual combined interest in the continued availability of rail service. We were victims of the \"tyranny of small decisions\".\nThucydides (c. 460–c. 395 BC) stated:\nAristotle (384–322 BC) similarly argued against common goods of the \"polis\" of Athens:\nThomas Mun (1571–1641), an English mercantilist, commented about decisions made with a myopic, small time perspective:\nEugen von Böhm-Bawerk (1851–1914), an Austrian economist, observed that decisions made with small time perspectives can have a seductive quality:\n\nIn 1982, the estuarine ecologist, William Odum, published a paper where he extended the notion of the tyranny of small decisions to environmental issues. According to Odum, \"much of the current confusion and distress surrounding environmental issues can be traced to decisions that were never consciously made, but simply resulted from a series of small decisions.\"\n\nOdum cites, as an example, the marshlands along the coasts of Connecticut and Massachusetts. Between 1950 and 1970, almost 50 percent of these marshlands were destroyed. This was not purposely planned, and the public may well have supported preservation had they been asked. Instead, hundreds of small tracts of marshland were converted to other purposes through hundreds of small decisions, resulting in a major outcome without the overall issue ever being directly addressed.\n\nAnother example is the Florida Everglades. These have been threatened, not by a single unfavorable decision, but by many independent pin prick decisions, such as decisions to add this well, that drainage canal, one more retirement village, another roadway... No explicit decision was made to restrict the flow of surface water into the glades, or to encourage hot, destructive fires and intensify droughts, yet this has been the outcome.\n\nWith few exceptions, threatened and endangered species owe their predicament to series of small decisions. Polar bears, humpback whales and bald eagles have suffered from the cumulative effects of single decisions to overexploit or convert habitats. The removal, one by one, of green turtle nesting beaches for other uses parallels the decline in green turtle populations.\n\nCultural lake eutrophication is rarely the result of an intentional decision. Instead, lakes eutrophy gradually as a cumulative effect of small decisions; the addition of this domestic sewage outfall and then that industrial outfall, with a runoff that increases steadily as this housing development is added, then that highway and some more agricultural fields. The insidious effects of small decisions marches on; productive land turns to desert, groundwater resources are overexploited to the point where they can't recover, persistent pesticides are used and tropical forests are cleared without factoring in the cumulative consequences.\n\nAn obvious counter to the tyranny of small decisions is to develop and protect appropriate upper levels of decision making. Depending on the issue, decision-making may be appropriate at a local, state, country or global level. However, organisations at these levels can entangle themselves in their own bureaucracy and politics, assigning decisions by default back to the lower levels. Political and scientific systems can encourage small decisions by rewarding specific problems and solutions. It is usually easier and more politic to make decisions on individual tracts of land or single issues rather than implementing large-scale policies. The same pattern applies with academic science. Most scientists are more comfortable working on specific problems rather than systems. This reductionist tendency towards the small problems is reinforced in the way grant monies and academic tenure are assigned.\n\nOdum advocates that at least some scientists should study systems so the negative consequences that result when many small decisions are made from a limited perspective can be avoided. There is a similar need for politicians and planners to understand large-scale perspectives. Environmental science teachers should include large-scale processes in their courses, with examples of the problems that decision making at inappropriate levels can introduce.\n\n"}

The company was founded in 1994 by Scott Schoonover, the music director of Union Avenue Christian Church, which serves as the company's venue in St. Louis' Visitation Park neighborhood.\n\nIn the summer of 1995, Scott Schoonover, with the support of the Arts Group of Union Avenue Christian Church and on a shoestring budget, mounted Union Avenue Opera Theatre's first production: Purcell’s \"Dido and Aeneas\", and since that time UAOT became an integral part of the St. Louis arts community. After two seasons of smaller productions from lesser known operatic repertoire, Artistic Director and Principal Conductor Schoonover produced a full-scale production of Mozart's \"Le nozze di Figaro\", sung in English, in 1998. This production spurred increased audience attendance as well as a growing donor base. Professional singers from beyond St. Louis took an interest in auditioning for the company as well, causing the company to expand its audition cities to Chicago, Kansas City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City. Early seasons featured operas either in English or foreign language works sung in the vernacular. However, with its 2000 production of Giacomo Puccini's \"La bohème\" sung in Italian, Union Avenue Opera Theatre began its ongoing practice of presenting opera in the original language with projected English supertitles.\n\nBetween 1998 and 2003, Union Avenue Opera Theatre usually produced one to two full productions per summer along with a concert staging of an operetta. For the company's 10th season in 2004, Schoonover expanded the season to three full productions in the summer. It was also during this season that, as a nod to the company's inaugural season, \"Dido and Aeneas\" appeared once again in the repertory to critical acclaim.\n\nIn 2005, the company began offering off-season productions in October which focused on suspense-driven, \"spooky\" repertoire including Gian Carlo Menotti's \"The Medium\", Benjamin Britten's \"The Turn of the Screw\", Béla Bartók's \"Duke Bluebeard's Castle\" and Puccini's \"Il tabarro\".\n\nSchoonover also revealed major renovation plans between the company and Union Avenue Christian Church. In 2007 a new orchestra pit and expanded stage were constructed successfully completing UAO’s first capital campaign. This renovation coincided with major improvements to the church sanctuary.\n\nThat season marked the welcoming of guest conductor Kostis Protopapas, of Tulsa Opera, to conduct a double bill of \"Suor Angelica\" and \"Gianni Schicchi\". Protopapas has since returned to conduct productions of \"Otello\", \"Lakmé\" and \"La fille du régiment\". Capping off the 2007 season, Union Avenue Opera collaborated with The Black Repertory Theater of St. Louis to present George Gershwin's \"Porgy and Bess\" in a staging by the Black Rep's founder and producing director Ron Himes. At the start of the 2008 season, Schoonover imported a production of Donizetti's \"L'Elisir d'Amore\" in 2008 as a shared production with Elgin Opera and Muddy River Opera Company. This production earned raves, and distinction as the most \"Family-Friendly Opera\" of the year, from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\nIn December 2009, UAO presented for the first time Menotti's \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\". The company revived \"Amahl\" yearly as a holiday production through 2011. In recent years, Union Avenue Opera has been awarded grants from several organizations including the Missouri Arts Council, the St. Louis Regional Arts Commission, the Arts and Education Council and the Fox Associates Performing Arts Foundation. Union Avenue Opera's 2013 season will include Puccini's \"Manon Lescaut\", Wagner's \"Die Walküre\" (in an adaptation by British composer Jonathan Dove) and Leonard Bernstein's \"Trouble in Tahiti\".\n\nIn August 2011, Union Avenue Opera presented the Missouri premiere of Jake Heggie's Dead Man Walking to great critical acclaim. In conjunction with the production, UAO and Union Avenue Christian Church invited anti-death penalty activist Sr. Helen Prejean, CSJ to speak on the opera and her ministry. Prejean herself attended the opening night performance.\n\nUnion Avenue Opera manages Springboard St. Louis’ opera component with workshops, residencies and performances for elementary school children. For several school years, UAO performed Seymour Barab's \"Little Red Riding Hood\" and most recently \"Carmen and the Bull\", which tells the story of Ferdinand the Bull set to musical themes in Bizet's \"Carmen\".\n\nThe company offers a variety of lectures and behind-the-scenes events in which patrons learn about upcoming productions, hear musical excerpts performed by UAO artists, listen to presentations, view costumes and tour sets in a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nUnion Avenue Opera has presented matinees of \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\" free of charge to local area school groups. The first ever matinee was underwritten by the Fox Charitable Performing Arts Foundation and the Boeing Employee Community Fund.\n\n1995\n\n\n1996\n\n\n1997\n\n\n1998\n\n\n1999\n\n\n2000\n\n\n2001\n\n\n2002\n\n\n2003\n\n\n2004\n\n\n2005\n\n\n2006\n\n\n2007\n\n\n2008\n\n\n2009\n\n\n2010\n\n\n2011\n\n\n2012\n\n\n2013\n\n\n2014\n\n\n2015\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36945036", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36945036", "title": "Vibration fatigue", "text": "Vibration fatigue\n\nVibration fatigue is a mechanical engineering term describing material fatigue, caused by forced vibration of random nature. An excited structure responds according to its natural-dynamics modes, which results in a dynamic stress load in the material points. The process of material fatigue is thus governed largely by the shape of the excitation profile and the response it produces. As the profiles of excitation and response are preferably analyzed in the frequency domain it is practical to use fatigue life evaluation methods, that can operate on the data in frequency-domain, such as power spectral density (PSD).\n\nA crucial part of a vibration fatigue analysis is the modal analysis, that exposes the natural modes and frequencies of the vibrating structure and enables accurate prediction of the local stress responses for the given excitation. Only then, when the stress responses are known, can vibration fatigue be successfully characterized.\n\nThe more classical approach of fatigue evaluation consists of cycle counting, using the rainflow algorithm and summation by means of the Palmgren-Miner linear damage hypothesis, that appropriately sums the damages of respective cycles. When the time history is not known, because the load is random (\"e.g.\" a car on a rough road or a wind driven turbine), those cycles can not be counted. Multiple time histories can be simulated for a given random process, but such procedure is cumbersome and computationally expensive.\n\nVibration-fatigue methods offer a more effective approach, which estimates fatigue life based on moments of the PSD. This way, a value is estimated, that would otherwise be calculated with the time-domain approach. When dealing with many material nodes, experiencing different responses (\"e.g.\" a model in a FEM package), time-histories need not be simulated. It then becomes viable, with the use of vibration-fatigue methods, to calculate fatigue life in many points on the structure and successfully predict where the failure will most probably occur.\n\nIn a random process, the amplitude can not be described as a function of time, because of its probabilistic nature. However, certain statistical properties can be extracted from a signal sample, representing a realization of a random process. An important characteristics for the field of vibration fatigue is the amplitude probability density function, that describes the statistical distribution of peak amplitudes. Ideally, the probability of cycle amplitudes, describing the load severity, could then be deduced directly. However, as this is not always possible, the sought-after probability is often estimated empirically.\n\nRandom excitation of the structure produces different responses, depending on the natural dynamics of the structure in question. Different natural modes get excited and each greatly affects the stress distribution in material. The standard procedure is to calculate frequency response functions for the analyzed structure and then obtain the stress responses, based on given loading or excitation. By exciting different modes, the spread of vibration energy over a frequency range directly affects the durability of the structure. Thus the structural dynamics analysis is a key part of vibration-fatigue evaluation.\n\nCalculation of damage intensity is straightforward once the cycle amplitude distribution is known. This distribution can be obtained from a time-history simply by counting cycles. To obtain it from the PSD another approach must be taken.\n\nVarious vibration-fatigue methods estimate damage intensity based on moments of the PSD, which characterize the statistical properties of the random process. The formulas for calculating such estimate are empirical (with very few exceptions) and are based on numerous simulations of random processes with known PSD. As a consequence, the accuracy of those methods varies, depending on analyzed response spectra, material parameters and the method itself - some are more accurate than others.\n\nThe most commonly used method is the one developed by T. Dirlik in 1985. Recent research on frequency-domain methods of fatigue-life estimation compared well established methods and also recent ones; conclusion showed that the methods by Zhao and Baker, developed in 1992 and by Benasciutti and Tovo, developed in 2004 are also very suitable for vibration-fatigue analysis.\n\nVibration fatigue methods find use wherever the structure experiences loading, that is caused by a random process. These can be the forces that bumps on the road extort on the car chassis, the wind blowing on the wind turbine, waves hitting an offshore construction or a marine vessel. Such loads are first characterized statistically, by measurement and analysis. The data is then used in the product design process.\n\nThe computational effectiveness of vibration-fatigue methods in contrast to the classical approach, enables their use in combination with FEM software packages, to evaluate fatigue after the loading is known and the dynamic analysis has been performed. Use of the vibration-fatigue methods is well-suited, as structural analysis is studied in the frequency-domain.\n\nCommon practice in the automotive industry is the use of accelerated vibration tests. During the test, a part or a product is exposed to vibration, that are in correlation with those expected during the service-life of the product. To shorten the testing time, the amplitudes are amplified. The excitation spectra used are broad-band and can be evaluated most effectively using vibration-fatigue methods.\n\n"}
