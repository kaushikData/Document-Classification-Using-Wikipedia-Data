The concert was broadcast live via television, radio, movie theaters and the Internet, and released on DVD and CD. A documentary film was also made about the concert. Proceeds from the event were collected by the Robin Hood Relief Fund to benefit victims of the hurricane in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. \n\nMany famous performers took part in the charity event, including The Who, Bruce Springsteen, Alicia Keys, Bon Jovi, Eric Clapton, Billy Joel, The Rolling Stones, Roger Waters, Chris Martin, Michael Stipe, Kanye West, Eddie Vedder, and, for the first time in eighteen years, the surviving members of Nirvana (Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic and touring member Pat Smear) who performed together in a collaboration with Paul McCartney during his show-closing set.\n\nThe benefit concert was first announced in mid-November 2012 and that the producers behind 2001's \"The Concert for New York City\" would also produce the Hurricane Sandy benefit which quickly attracted many big names from the music industry. The venue and on sale date for tickets were announced in early December. Madison Square Garden had originally been reserved on December 12 for a New York Rangers game against the Montreal Canadiens that was among the many canceled due to the 2012 NHL lockout.\n\nProceeds from the event went to the Robin Hood Relief Fund and benefit victims of the hurricane in areas most impacted, especially New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. More than $30 million was raised through ticket sales alone.\n\nTickets for the event went on sale through Ticketmaster on December 3, 2012, at noon though Chase Bank customers were allowed to buy tickets at 9 a.m. Tickets quickly sold out in minutes. The face-value of tickets ranged from $150 to $2,500, with organizers saying all proceeds would go to the Robin Hood Foundation. Like most concerts with high demands for tickets, scalpers were able to buy up tickets and within minutes of the concert selling out were already available for re-sale at much higher prices on various sites, including StubHub. By December 7, 2012, tickets for the floor in front of the stage were listed for as much as $48,000 while those in the upper level were going for $525 to $3,000. \n\nProducers of the event urged people to not buy from these secondary websites because the money no longer goes to charity. U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer sent a letter to StubHub and three other major online ticket exchanges, urging them to not allow sellers to profit from the demand for the concert stating that \"Every dollar spent for these concert tickets should go to help the victims of Superstorm Sandy, not to line the pockets of unscrupulous scalpers”. A spokesman for StubHub, Glenn Lehrman, said it did not have the technology to require sellers to give their profits to charity. StubHub gave its commissions of more than $500,000 to the charity.\n\nJacqueline Peterson, a spokeswoman for Ticketmaster, which handled the initial ticket sales, said her company had evidence that scalpers had used computer programs to snap up large numbers of tickets for resale. She said Ticketmaster had blocked thousands of sales to buyers that it identified as using these programs. Among the recipients of Schumer's letter were TicketMaster's in-house resale marketplaces, TicketsNow and TicketExchange; however, Peterson said that 12-12-12 tickets were not being allowed on those sites. TicketLiquidator, another secondary re-sale website, also said that it had declined to carry tickets for the concert.\n\nThere were also some incidents of counterfeit tickets.\n\nThe concert was simulcast live on 39 U.S. television stations, including HBO, AMC, Showtime and AXS TV and on more than 20 international television networks. It was also streamed on over twenty-five websites, including Fuse.tv, MTV.com, AOL, Yahoo!, YouTube, SiriusXM, Hulu, and Vevo and over fifty radio stations. Select movie theaters in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut displayed the concert as well. Ion Television, Live Well Network and MundoFox were the only national over-the-air broadcasters to carry the concert. Locally, the PBS consortium WNET/WLIW/NJTV carried it on their stations, along with CBS's WLNY (Channel 55) and WRNN-TV (Channel 48). WPSG (Channel 57) carried the show locally in Philadelphia.\n\nEvent producers James Dolan, John Sykes and Harvey Weinstein issued on December 3, 2012, the following joint statement: \"The fact that so many major media companies are joining forces to distribute and stream this important event to homes worldwide will enable us to create a tremendous and unprecedented fundraising effort on a global scale to benefit the victims of this devastating storm.\"\n\nWhile every major U.S. media company aired the benefit on at least one of their networks, none of the major over-the-air television networks including CBS, ABC, Fox and NBC aired it, and neither did the major cable-news networks of CNN, MSNBC and the Fox News Channel. Clear Channel broadcast the concert live on some of its radio stations across the country and also streamed it live on iHeartRadio, its digital-radio service, and across the websites and Facebook pages of its 850 stations. The concert also aired in conjunction with the NBA's television and online streaming broadcasts in China and simulcast live on Clear Channel Outdoor digital billboards in Times Square and locations in London and Paris.\n\nThe event began at 7:30 pm and ran until 1:20 am.\n\n\n"}

The match was played by England and West Germany on 30 July 1966 at Wembley Stadium in London, and had an attendance of 96,924. The British television audience peaked at 32.3 million viewers, making it the most watched television event ever in the United Kingdom.\n\nEngland won 4–2 after extra time to win the Jules Rimet Trophy. The England team became known as the \"wingless wonders\", on account of their then-unconventional narrow attacking formation, described at the time as a 4–4–2. The match is remembered for England's only World Cup trophy, Geoff Hurst's hat-trick – the first, and to date, only one ever scored in a FIFA World Cup Final – and the controversial third goal awarded to England by referee Gottfried Dienst and linesman Tofiq Bahramov.\n\nBoth teams were strong throughout the tournament. Each won two and drew one of their three matches in the group stages. England did not concede a goal until their semi-final against Portugal.\n\nOne of the enduring images of the celebrations in Wembley immediately after the game was the picture of the captain Bobby Moore holding the Jules Rimet Trophy aloft, on the shoulders of Geoff Hurst and Ray Wilson, together with Martin Peters. In recognition of Moore and other West Ham United players' contribution to the win, the club and Newham Borough Council jointly commissioned a statue of this scene. On 28 April 2003 Prince Andrew as president of The Football Association, duly unveiled the \"World Cup Sculpture\" (also called \"The Champions\") in a prominent place near West Ham's ground, at the time, the Boleyn Ground, at the junction of Barking Road and Green Street. The -high bronze piece was sculpted by Philip Jackson and weighed 4 tonnes.\n\nThe final is the most watched event ever on British television, as of July 2018, attracting 32.30 million viewers. In Germany, a goal resulting from a shot bouncing off the crossbar and hitting the line is called a \"Wembley-Tor\" (Wembley Goal) due to the controversial nature of Hurst's second goal. This goal has been parodied a large number of times. Some of the most notable include:\n\n\nIn August 1966 a special 4d stamp marked was issued by the Royal Mail to celebrate the victory and which soared in value to up to 15 shillings each on the back of public enthusiasm for the victory before falling back in value when the public realised it was not rare.\n\nThe 1991 BBC miniseries \"Sleepers\", about a pair of deep-cover KGB agents placed in England in the mid-1960s and then forgotten includes a subplot about an archive film of the match recorded by Soviet agents and then placed in archives. A KGB officer who sees the film in the early 1990s is excited to discover it includes footage of the disputed goal and attempts to sell it to a contact at a television network (pointedly described as not the BBC). \"Sleepers\" is coy about what the film depicts and in the course of the story, the film is destroyed.\n\nMarking the 50th anniversary of England's World Cup victory in July 2016, ITV broadcast \"1966 – A Nation Remembers\", which was narrated by the actor Terence Stamp who attended every England game at the tournament.\n\nThe World Cup win features in the song \"Three Lions\" (known by its chorus \"Football's Coming Home\"), the unofficial anthem of the England football team. England's win in the final also helped fans to create the \"Two World Wars and One World Cup\" chant.\n\nThe players and staff of England's winning squad who did not get medals in 1966 received them on 10 June 2009 after a ceremony at 10 Downing Street in London. Initially, only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the match received medals, but FIFA later awarded medals to every non-playing squad and staff member from every World Cup-winning country from 1930 to 1974.\n\n"}

The anti-semitic attacks have become frequent in Soviet towns ravaged by war; at the marketplaces, in depleted stores, in schools, and even at state enterprises. Protest letters were sent to Moscow from numerous Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian towns by the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee involved in documenting the Holocaust.\n\nThe Soviet authorities failed to address the years of Hitler's anti-Jewish propaganda, wrote Colonel David Dragunsky; anti-Semitic elements from among the former Nazi collaborators in the Soviet Union were often put in charge of state enterprises. Solomon Mikhailovich Mikhoels, Chairman of JAFC murdered in Minsk in January 1948 wrote that Jewish homes were not being returned. In Berdichev, Mogilev-Podolsk Balta, Zhmerinka, Vinnitsa, Khmelnik, Old Rafalovka and many other towns, Jews were forced to remain in the areas of former Nazi ghettos for their own safety. The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee (JAFC) was targeted by Soviet authorities directly in the so-called rootless cosmopolitan campaign of the second half of the 1940s and in the Night of the Murdered Poets.\n\nSeveral months after the Mikhoels assassination, other Jewish figures were arrested. His death signalled the beginning of the country-wide repressions of the Jews accused of espionage and economic crimes. A campaign against Zionism was launched in the fall of 1948. By the end of the decade Jews disappeared from the upper echelons of the party in the republics. This was followed by the Jewish doctor-killers case of 1952–53 accompanied by publications of anti-Semitic texts in the media, and hundreds of torture interrogations. Most communities in the Soviet Union never acknowledged the involvement of the local auxiliary police in the Holocaust. The vast majority of the 300,000 \"Schutzmannschaft\" members in the German-occupied territories of the USSR, quietly returned to their former lives, including members of the Byelorussian Home Defence participating in the pacification actions in which some 30,000 Jews were murdered, and members of \"Ukrainische Hilfspolizei\" battalions responsible for the extermination of 150,000 Jews in the area of Volhynia alone. Khrushchev proclaimed that the Jews were not welcome in the Ukraine.\n\nUpon the Soviet takeover of Poland \"only a fraction of [the Jewish] deaths could be attributed to anti-semitism\" wrote Jan T. Gross. Most have been caused by the raging anti-communist insurrection against the new pro-Soviet government. The anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–46 took the lives of at least 327 Jews.\n\nHundreds of returning Jews were killed in Romania. Anti-Jewish manifestations, sometimes based on blood libel accusations, took place in Hungary in a dozen of places, for example, in Kunmadaras (two or four dead victims) and Miskolc.\n\nIn Slovakia in Topoľčany 48 Jews were seriously injured in September 1945. A number of Jews was murdered in Kolbasov in December. Reportedly 13 anti-Jewish incidents called \"partisan pogroms\" took place 1–5 August 1946, the biggest one in Žilina, where 15 people were wounded. Anti-Semitic manifestations took place in Bratislava in August 1946 and in August 1948 including anti-Jewish riots in several other locations.\n\nIn Kiev, Ukraine on September 4–7, 1945, around one hundred Jews were beaten, of whom thirty-six were hospitalized and five died of wounds. In Rubtsovsk, Russia a number of anti-Semitic incidents took place in 1945.\n\n"}

On this occasion the stage and the auditorium of the Opera is transformed into a huge ballroom. The dress code is evening dress: white tie and tailcoat for men, floor-length gowns for women. The ball is opened by more than a hundred debutante dancers after a show consisting of selected arias, followed by the \"Alles Walzer\" with people dancing until dawn. Recent international guests include Montserrat Caballé, Ornella Muti, Yevgeny Nesterenko, Walter Berry, Heinz Zednik, Katia Ricciarelli, Patrizio Buanne, Catherine Deneuve, Katarina Witt, Gina Lollobrigida, Daryl Hannah, and Guy de Rothschild.

The 185th overall episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 1, 2009. In the episode, the men and boys of South Park become infuriated when the fart-joke oriented \"Terrance and Phillip\" show is replaced with the \"Queef Sisters\", a show devoted to queef jokes. The women and girls of South Park accuse them of holding a sexist double standard when it comes to women queefing and men farting.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. Parker and Matt Stone originally considered doing a full-length \"Queef Sisters\" episode in the style of the second season premiere \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\", but they decided against it based on the negative fan reaction to that episode.\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews and, according to Nielsen Media Research, was seen by more than three million households in its original airing, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. The title is a reference to the Elizabeth Gilbert book \"Eat, Pray, Love\"; the episode also included references to Martha Stewart and the film \"The Road Warrior\". The episode ends with the South Park men recording \"Queef Free\", a charity song in the style of \"We Are The World\" mixed with lyrics from \"I Am Woman\". \"Eat, Pray, Queef\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16, 2010.\n\nThe boys of South Park Elementary School are anxiously awaiting the night's episode of \"Terrance and Phillip\", which ended in a cliffhanger last season, while the girls at the school express disgust over the show and the boys' obsession with fart jokes. Cartman retaliates by farting in a little girl's face, which causes all the boys to laugh. After school, the boys gather in Cartman's house to watch the episode. To their horror, it is then revealed that, as an April Fools' Day joke, the channel is airing a new show called the \"Queef Sisters\", about Canadian sisters Katherine (voiced by Trey Parker) and Katie Queef (voiced by Matt Stone). They are very similar to Terrance and Phillip, but instead of fart jokes, they make queef jokes. The show starts a queefing movement across the country, and men everywhere get upset and disgusted by the queefs, although the women do not understand what the problem is. Though the women of South Park argue that there is no difference between queefing and farting, the men are revolted by queefs, while still finding their own fart jokes amusing.\n\nMeanwhile, Terrance and Phillip are furious their show got replaced with \"The Queef Sisters\", sharing the American Men's disgust of queef jokes. When the producer asks why they think fart jokes are funny, but are revolted by queef jokes, Terrance says it's \"because babies come from there.\"\n\nAs a joke mirroring Cartman's, one of the girls at school queefs on Butters' face, causing him to run screaming and crying out of the school building. The other boys are shocked and their fathers, outraged, go to the Colorado General Assembly and demand a law banning queefing, much to the anger of the town's women. Meanwhile, the Queef Sisters appear on \"Regis and Kelly\" to promote their book \"Eat, Pray, Queef\", and Terrance and Philip's show gets canceled due to the rising popularity of the Queef Sisters. Terrance and Philip attempt to kill the Queef Sisters, but the plan backfires when they end up becoming attracted to them after the Queef Sisters mention that Terrence and Phillip are the sisters' idols. They pair off into couples and travel the Canadian Wine Country together. Meanwhile, after Stan's mother Sharon queefs, she and Stan's sister, Shelley, start laughing at the dinner table, causing Stan and his father Randy to leave.\n\nFeeling sorry for Butters, the South Park boys testify in the case in the Colorado State Senate about the girl who queefed on Butters. A debate on the senate floor culminates with a female senator queefing almost exact lines of dialogue from \"The Road Warrior\" film. The next day, the newspapers announce that, partly due to the senator's stunt the previous day, the queefing ban has passed. As Stan and his father Randy celebrate, Sharon and Shelley are hurt and insulted by the decision, describing it as an example of sexism that still pervades society, and finally sarcastically congratulate the men for \"getting their own way... again.\" Stan and Randy finally understand the issue was not simply about queefing, but a larger point about women's rights. The two get all the South Park men together and record an inspirational song called \"Queef Free\", declaring women should have the right to queef, while photographs of women working various careers are displayed on a television screen. Terrance and Philip, despite a continued disgust with the constant queefing, attempt to marry the two Queef Sisters. The vicar leaves the ceremony in disgust as the couples repeatedly fart and queef on him, pronouncing them \"Farts and Queefs\" as he leaves.\n\n\"Eat, Pray, Queef\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker. It first aired on April 1, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. Although Parker and fellow co-creator Matt Stone acknowledged it was a particularly juvenile episode, Parker said it was his favorite show of the season to produce. He said, \"I seriously never laughed as hard doing retakes, just going shot-by-shot, sitting there in the editing room laughing.\" During the writing process, the female producers and employees with the show found the script largely unfunny, disgusting and offensive. They reportedly claimed vaginal flatulence would not bloom into a proud women's movement as it did in the episode, but Parker and Stone insisted that was what made the concept even funnier.\n\nOriginally, Parker and Stone considered making a full-length episode of \"The Queef Sisters\". The duo had pulled a similar stunt with the second season premiere. Instead of the expected follow-up to \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\", in which the identity of Cartman's father was to be revealed, Parker and Matt Stone showed the episode \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\", a Terrance and Phillip-centered episode as an April Fools' Day prank. Since \"Eat, Pray, Queef\" was coincidentally also set to air on April Fools' Day, they considered a similar joke revolving around Katherine and Katie. However, since \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\" infuriated \"South Park\" fans at the time, they decided not to do it and wrote a full script for \"Eat, Pray, Queef\" instead. The original prank is referenced in the episode, when The Canada Channel announces that it will not air a much-anticipated part two episode of Terrance and Phillip, and instead will show the \"Queef Sisters\" as an April Fools' Day prank. The angry reaction from the boys mirrors the real-life fan reaction to the \"South Park\" second season premiere.\n\nThe episode uses the characters' conflicting responses to the comedic value of farts and queefs to demonstrate a double standard between rights of men and women, even in the 21st century, as both genders hold unfair opinions toward the other sex, and the episode suggests men and women are, and should be, equals. Shortly after \"Eat, Pray, Queef\" was originally broadcast, the site also featured T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode. One featured Katherine and Katie queefing and saying, \"Babies come from there!\"\n\nThe book \"Eat, Pray, Queef\" by the Queef Sisters, which is also the source of the episode's title, is a satirical reference to the book \"Eat, Pray, Love\" written by Elizabeth Gilbert. There is a brief scene in which television host Martha Stewart provides instruction on ways to decorate queefs on \"The Martha Stewart Show\". Television show hosts Regis Philbin and Kelly Ripa interview Katie and Katherine on their show, \"Live with Regis and Kelly\". One of the queefs released by a woman in the episode includes exact dialogue from the 1981 action film \"The Road Warrior\". The montage sequence where Terrance and Phillip take Katherine and Katie on a tour of Canadian wine country is a parody of a similar montage sequence in the 2004 comedy film \"Sideways\". The men's anthem \"Queef Free\" is a parody of \"We Are The World\", the 1985 celebrities-for-charity song written by Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie.\n\nWithin the episode, The Canada Channel announces that, as an April Fools' Day prank, it will be airing the new Queef Sisters show instead of the much-anticipated part two episode of Terrance and Phillip. This is a reference to the \"South Park\" second season premiere. Instead of the expected follow-up to \"Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut\", in which the identity of Cartman's father was to be revealed, Parker and Matt Stone showed the episode \"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\", a Terrance and Phillip-centered episode as an April Fools' Day prank. The move infuriated \"South Park\" fans.\n\nA preview clip of the episode listed on South Park Studios, the official \"South Park\" website, during the week before the episode's broadcast was viewed more than 50,000 times. In its original American broadcast, \"Eat, Pray, Queef\" was watched by three million households overall, according to the Nielsen Media Research, making it the most-watched Comedy Central production of the week. It had over one million more household viewers than the second most watched Comedy Central show that week, the April 1 episode of \"The Daily Show\".\n\nNiki Payne of the \"Philadelphia Examiner\" said \"Eat, Pray, Queef\" was \"probably one of my all-time favorite episodes of \"South Park\" right now\" because it was so on point concerning the double standards between men and women. She particularly praised the scene in which Stan and Randy are disgusted and uncomfortable when Stan's mom and sister started queefing at the dinner table. Carlos Delgado of \"If Magazine\" said the episode was \"shocking, disgusting and obscenely funny\" and demonstrated \"South Park\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s ability to tackle any type of issue \"in a uniquely \"South Park\" manner\". He particularly enjoyed the Martha Stewart segment, which he described as \"just haunting\". Josh Modell of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a B grade. Modell said the Katie and Katherine cartoon was particularly funny, but queefing was referred to in so many jokes that it became a bit tired by the end.\n\nSome reviewers were less laudatory. Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode was \"a textbook example of a disappointing \"South Park\"\".

{"id": "70426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=70426", "title": "Edema", "text": "Edema\n\nEdema, also spelled oedema or œdema, is an abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitium, located beneath the skin and in the cavities of the body, which can cause severe pain. Clinically, edema manifests as swelling. The amount of interstitial fluid is determined by the balance of fluid homeostasis and the increased secretion of fluid into the interstitium. The word is from Greek \"oídēma\" meaning \"swelling\". The condition is also known (mostly archaic) as dropsy.\n\nCutaneous edema is referred to as \"pitting\" when, after pressure is applied to a small area, the indentation persists after the release of the pressure. Peripheral pitting edema, as shown in the illustration, is the more common type, resulting from water retention. It can be caused by systemic diseases, pregnancy in some women, either directly or as a result of heart failure, or local conditions such as varicose veins, thrombophlebitis, insect bites, and dermatitis.\n\nNon-pitting edema is observed when the indentation does not persist. It is associated with such conditions as lymphedema, lipedema, and myxedema.\n\nEdema caused by malnutrition defines kwashiorkor, an acute form of childhood protein-energy malnutrition characterized by edema, irritability, anorexia, ulcerating dermatoses, and an enlarged liver with fatty infiltrates.\n\nA rise in hydrostatic pressure occurs in cardiac failure. A fall in osmotic pressure occurs in nephrotic syndrome and liver failure.\n\nCauses of edema which are generalized to the whole body can cause edema in multiple organs and peripherally. For example, severe heart failure can cause pulmonary edema, pleural effusions, ascites and peripheral edema. Such severe systemic edema is called anasarca. In rare cases, a Parvovirus B19 infection may cause generalized edemas.\n\nAlthough a low plasma oncotic pressure is widely cited for the edema of nephrotic syndrome, most physicians note that the edema may occur before there is any significant protein in the urine (proteinuria) or fall in plasma protein level. Most forms of nephrotic syndrome are due to biochemical and structural changes in the basement membrane of capillaries in the kidney glomeruli, and these changes occur, if to a lesser degree, in the vessels of most other tissues of the body. Thus the resulting increase in permeability that leads to protein in the urine can explain the edema if all other vessels are more permeable as well.\n\nAs well as the previously mentioned conditions, edemas often occur during the late stages of pregnancy in some women. This is more common with those of a history of pulmonary problems or poor circulation also being intensified if arthritis is already present in that particular woman. Women that already have arthritic problems most often have to seek medical help for pain caused from over-reactive swelling. Edemas that occur during pregnancy are usually found in the lower part of the leg, usually from the calf down.\n\nAn edema will occur in specific organs as part of inflammations, tendonitis or pancreatitis, for instance. Certain organs develop edema through tissue specific mechanisms.\n\nExamples of edema in specific organs:\n\nSix factors can contribute to the formation of edema:\n\nGeneration of interstitial fluid is regulated by the forces of the Starling equation. Hydrostatic pressure within blood vessels tends to cause water to filter out into the tissue. This leads to a difference in protein concentration between blood plasma and tissue. As a result, the colloidal or oncotic pressure of the higher level of protein in the plasma tends to draw water back into the blood vessels from the tissue. Starling's equation states that the rate of leakage of fluid is determined by the difference between the two forces and also by the permeability of the vessel wall to water, which determines the rate of flow for a given force imbalance. Most water leakage occurs in capillaries or post capillary venules, which have a semi-permeable membrane wall that allows water to pass more freely than protein. (The protein is said to be reflected and the efficiency of reflection is given by a reflection constant of up to 1.) If the gaps between the cells of the vessel wall open up then permeability to water is increased first, but as the gaps increase in size permeability to protein also increases with a fall in reflection coefficient.\n\nChanges in the variables in Starling's equation can contribute to the formation of edemas either by an increase in hydrostatic pressure within the blood vessel, a decrease in the oncotic pressure within the blood vessel or an increase in vessel wall permeability. The latter has two effects. It allows water to flow more freely and it reduces the colloidal or oncotic pressure difference by allowing protein to leave the vessel more easily.\n\nWhen possible, treatment involves resolving the underlying cause.\n\nTreatment may also involve positioning the affected body parts to improve drainage. For example, swelling in feet or ankles may be reduced by having the person lie down in bed or sit with the feet propped up on cushions. Intermittent pneumatic compression can be used to pressurize tissue in a limb, forcing fluids – both blood and lymph – to flow out of the pressurized area. Treatment of persistent edemas, such as idiopathic bilateral lymphedema, may also use manual lymphatic drainage, a low-pressure massage technique designed to pump lymphatic fluid by a similar mechanism.\n\n"}
{"id": "55295297", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55295297", "title": "Final Burning in Budokan", "text": "Final Burning in Budokan\n\nFinal Burning in Budokan was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event promoted by Pro Wrestling Noah, which took place on May 11, 2013, at Nippon Budokan in Tokyo, Japan. Headlined by the retirement match of Kenta Kobashi, all in all, the event featured seven matches and wrestlers from not only Noah, but also All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), Diamond Ring, New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and Tenryu Project. Due to Kobashi's high-profile status in the history of Japanese professional wrestling, the event gained mainstream attention in the country. Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" called the event the \"end of an era in Japanese pro wrestling\", drawing parallels to Pelé's 1977 retirement from soccer.\n\nOn December 3, 2012, the \"Tokyo Sports\" newspaper reported that Pro Wrestling Noah had decided to terminate the contract of veteran wrestler Kenta Kobashi due to financial issues. Kobashi had been with Noah since its inception in 2000 and had been the reigning All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) Triple Crown Heavyweight Champion, when he left AJPW to follow Mitsuharu Misawa to the newly-created promotion. Kobashi then became the catalyst in a period, where Noah enjoyed great success with Nippon Budokan sellouts and classic matches. At a time when mixed martial arts was doing strong business in Japan and professional wrestling was seen as the \"old fake version\", Kobashi's drawing power kept Noah the most popular professional wrestling promotion in the country. However, while the promotion had once been considered one of the best in the world, it had recently fallen on hard times. First Kobashi started suffering from various injuries, which quickly took a toll on Noah's popularity. Kobashi's hard hitting style meant that by the age of 24, his knees were described as being \"thrashed\" and by the age of 33, he had had more than a dozen operations. Kobashi also battled kidney cancer, which sidelined him for 17 months in early 2006. None of the wrestlers designed to replace Kobashi at the top of Noah had his charisma or drawing power and eventually the promotion lost its network television contract. Following Misawa's death in the ring in 2009, the promotion started to unravel with financial issues and dissension in the front office. Despite not having wrestled in almost a year, Kobashi was the highest paid worker in Noah and by December 2012 the company simply could no longer afford him.\nNoah's decision to cut Kobashi led to an immediate backlash from wrestlers loyal to him with Atsushi Aoki, Go Shiozaki, Jun Akiyama, Kotaro Suzuki and Yoshinobu Kanemaru announcing their resignation from the promotion. The five ended up joining AJPW after their contracts with Noah expired at the end of the year, forming a new version of the Burning stable, which had originally been formed by Kobashi and Akiyama in 1998.\n\nOn December 9, 2012, Kobashi appeared at Noah's Ryōgoku Kokugikan event, announcing his retirement from professional wrestling, having deemed it impossible to fully recover from the accumulation of his injuries. Stating that he wanted to wrestle one final match, Kobashi added that he was not being forced to retire. Originally Kobashi planned to have his retirement match on February 26, 2013, which would have been the 25th anniversary of his debut, but quickly realized he needed more time to get into ring shape, which led to the date being pushed back to May 11, 2013. The date was confirmed on January 23, and on March 31, it was announced that Kobashi's retirement match would be an eight-man tag team match, where he, Jun Akiyama, Keiji Mutoh and Kensuke Sasaki would take on Go Shiozaki, Kenta, Maybach Taniguchi and Yoshinobu Kanemaru. Out of his partners, Kobashi was particularly close to Akiyama, with the history between the two dating back 20 years to their junior days in AJPW. The entire team opposing Kobashi was made up of his protégés. Tokyo's Nippon Budokan was chosen as the arena for the show. Despite Noah's recent difficulties, it was considered a \"given\" that the promotion could sell out Nippon Budokan for the show, while Tokyo Dome was deemed \"too big of a risk\". Kobashi also had significant history with Nippon Budokan. Big matches in his early career as well as his tag team tournament and Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship wins had taken place in the arena and during his two-year run as the GHC Heavyweight Champion, Noah held its big shows in the arena.\nKobashi's retirement event received significant coverage in mainstream media in Japan. Several magazines ran special editions dedicated entirely to Kobashi. The event was streamed into movie theaters across Japan. Every theater in Tokyo was sold out, most well ahead of time. Japan's former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, who had stated that Kobashi was his favorite wrestler, announced that he would attend the event.\n\nKobashi trained for the match at the Pro Wrestling Noah dojo, where he had trained since the promotion's founding in 2000. He would enter his final match weighing . This would mark his first match in 455 days.\n\nThe show was opened by an appearance by Hayabusa, who had been paralyzed in the ring in 2001. With help from crutches, he walked to the ring and talked about taking a lariat from Kobashi in Nippon Budokan.\n\nIn the opening match of the show, Masanobu Fuchi defeated Hitoshi Kumano with the backdrop. Fuchi was one of Kobashi's original trainers and the match was designed to show him now, a generation later, training the recently debuted Kumano.\n\nIn the second match, Atsushi Kotoge and Taiji Ishimori took on Genba Hirayanagi and Suwa. During the match, former prime minister Yoshihiko Noda, who was seated in the front row, took part in a spot, where Hirayanagi recreated a spit spot made famous by Haruka Eigen. During the match, Suwa suffered a spinal injury and was stretchered out of the arena, after Ishimori pinned Hirayanagi with the 450° splash to end the match.\n\nThe third match featured Atsushi Aoki and Kotaro Suzuki facing Kentaro Shiga and Tamon Honda. Aoki and Suzuki had quit Noah in protest over Kobashi's treatment and were now representing AJPW. Honda was Kobashi's training partner for years and at one point his regular tag team partner. The match was billed as \"Burning vs. Burning\", with Aoki and Suzuki being part of the new Burning stable in AJPW, while Shiga and Honda had been part of the earlier version of the group. Aoki and Suzuki won the match with Suzuki pinning Shiga for the win with the \"Endless Waltz\".\n\nAfter the third match, Kobashi came out to the ring for his retirement ceremony, which was also attended by wrestlers Akira Taue, Hiroshi Hase, Masahiro Chono, Masanobu Fuchi, Mitsuo Momota, Takeshi Rikio and Toshiaki Kawada as well as Asuka Kuramochi from AKB48 and Yoshihiko Noda among others. The ceremony also included a written statement from John Laurinaitis, Kobashi's on-and-off tag team partner in the 90s, and a pre-taped promo from Stan Hansen.\n\nThe fourth match of the show saw Genichiro Tenryu and Yoshinari Ogawa defeat Masao Inoue and Takeshi Morishima.\n\nThe fifth match featured the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) trio of Hiroshi Tanahashi, Satoshi Kojima and Yuji Nagata taking on the Noah trio of Akitoshi Saito, Muhammad Yone and Takashi Sugiura. The NJPW wrestlers, Tanahashi in particular, were booed by the Noah crowd. Tanahashi won the match for his team by pinning Saito with the \"High Fly Flow\".\nThe sixth match featured the reunion of No Fear as Takao Omori and Yoshihiro Takayama, who had teamed together in both AJPW and Noah, took on Minoru Suzuki and Naomichi Marufuji. No Fear won the match with Takayama pinning Marufuji with the \"Everest German Suplex Hold\".\n\nThe main event of the show was the retirement match of Kenta Kobashi, where he teamed with Jun Akiyama, Keiji Mutoh and Kensuke Sasaki to take on Go Shiozaki, Kenta, Maybach Taniguchi and Yoshinobu Kanemaru. Kobashi came to the ring wearing an old version of the GHC Heavyweight Championship belt. He had not actually held the title since 2005, but was considered both the greatest champion in the title's history as well as the man most synonymous with the title, nicknamed the . The match featured Kobashi doing several of his signature moves, including the \"Cobra Twist\", half nelson suplex, rolling cradle and 187 chops. At the end, he hit Kanemaru with a superplex and a lariat, but his pin attempt was broken up by Kanemaru's partners. Akiyama then hit Taniguchi with an exploder suplex and Sasaki hit a German suplex on Kenta, while Mutoh hit a backbreaker and a moonsault on Kanemaru. Akiyama, Mutoh and Sasaki then all signaled for Kobashi, who hit a body slam on Kanemaru and then climbed the ropes for the final moonsault of his career, which won the match for his team.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the match, the ring and ringside area were filled with wrestlers. Kobashi's wife and mother also came to the ring for his retirement speech. After a ten-bell salute to signal the end of Kobashi's career, his greatest accomplishments were read out loud after which the event concluded with his theme song \"Grand Sword\" being played in Nippon Budokan.\n\nIn June 2014, Kobashi started producing his own independent events under the banner of \"Fortune Dream\". In addition to putting together the cards, featuring wrestlers from multiple promotions, Kobashi would participate in the shows in sit-down interview segments with fellow veteran wrestlers, including Genichiro Tenryu and Riki Choshu.\n\nBy the end of 2015, Go Shiozaki, Kotaro Suzuki and Yoshinobu Kanemaru, three of the five wrestlers who had quit Noah in protest, had quit AJPW. Shiozaki and Kanemaru quickly returned to Noah, with Shiozaki re-signing with the promotion in June 2016. Akiyama and Aoki remain in AJPW, with Akiyama having taken over as the promotion's president in July 2014.\n\nKensuke Sasaki, one of the veteran wrestlers who had teamed with Kobashi in the main event of the show, announced his retirement on February 13, 2014. Unlike Kobashi, Sasaki decided against doing a retirement match, with his final match having already taken place two days earlier.\n\n\n"}

Songs performed in the foam are \"I'll Be Glad When You're Dead, You Rascal You\" and \"Shine\". Another film featuring foam parties is \"The Party\", featuring Peter Sellers.\n\nModern foam parties were developed in the early 1990s by club promoters in Ibiza. Generally, machines were large, ceiling mounted foam generators, that created a large volume of foam that fell from the ceiling onto clubbers. The large water usage and subsequent cleanup required made this impractical many venues.\n\nAs Ibiza foam parties became more popular the craze spread, and the foam cannon was developed by Roy Barlow from The Entertainment Biz and Robin Wincup from Galaxy. In 1992, this was introduced into the UK, where these were the first machines to meet with all UK health and safety requirements.\n\nIn the 1990s, the foam parties were performed weekly at Amnesia in Ibiza.\n\nLisa Flam, writing for \"TODAY\", catalogued numerous hazards associated with foam parties. And Yael Levi, writing for Ynet News, reported: in 2008, three people were electrocuted and two others injured at a foam party at the Venezia Palace Hotel in Antalya, Turkey.\n"}

It originally started in 1976, and for many years was based at the London Astoria.\n\nG-A-Y originally began in 1976 in the Sundown club in the basement of the London Astoria (later LA2) as a Monday night event called \"Bang!\". It was started by club promoters Norman Scott, Damien Tony and Jerry Collins, who worked as a DJ under the name Gary London. During the 1980s, \"Bang!\" (which had by then also expanded to Saturday night) and \"Propaganda\" (Thursday night) were run by gay club promoter and DJ Colin Peters (Peter Daubeney), whose brother Jamie continued as promoter for a period following his death. In the early 1990s, \"Bang!\" was acquired by DJ and promoter Jeremy Joseph who was formerly employed by Peters, who oversaw its change of name to \"G-A-Y\". At this point, G-A-Y expanded further from two nights a week to four - hosting at the LA2 on Mondays and Thursdays and the London Astoria on Fridays and Saturdays.\n\nIt operated from the London Astoria music venue for 15 years until July 2008. The Boston Globe described it as \"London's largest gay-themed club night\", \"NME\" reported that it \"attracts 6,000 clubbers each week\", and \"The Independent\" described it as \"the one London gig that really matters\" for \"today's pop stars\". \n\nG-A-Y is associated with \"G-A-Y Bar\" and \"G-A-Y Late\". A major stake in the brand was bought on 13 August 2007 by the MAMA Group. On Friday 3 October 2008, G-A-Y moved to famous gay venue Heaven, which MAMA Group has acquired a few weeks earlier on 22 September 2008.\n\nIn 2000, a 40 track compilation album was released, featuring songs from some of the artists who had appeared at G-A-Y. A promotional campaign took place in the weeks leading up to release, including television and radio advertisements, a nationwide poster campaign and magazine advertisements in both the gay and teen press.\n\nOn Saturday 1 July 2000, a show was held at G-A-Y to promote the release of the album. Seven acts who appeared on the album performed. These acts were Shola Ama, All Saints, Bananarama, Dina Carroll, Billie Piper, Honeyz and Louise. Each act performed only one song, apart from Louise, who also performed her new single \"2 Faced\".\n\nThe G-A-Y album was released on Monday 3 July 2000 and peaked at number 18 in the UK compilations chart.\n\nThe G-A-Y brand has expanded to two other bars in the area. G-A-Y Late (located near the former Astoria site) and G-A-Y bar (located nearby in Soho's Old Compton Street). In April 2011, the G-A-Y brand arrived on Manchester's iconic Canal Street with a G-A-Y bar opening in the former venue of Spirit Bar.

The precise etymology of the word however, is a compound of the ancient Greek word \"γένος\" (birth, genus, kind) or Latin word \"gēns\" (tribe, clan) and the Latin word \"caedō\" (cut, kill). While there are various definitions of the term, almost all international bodies of law officially adjudicate the crime of genocide pursuant to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (CPPCG). This and other definitions are generally regarded by the majority of genocide scholars to have an \"intent to destroy\" as a requirement for any act to be labelled genocide; there is also growing agreement on the inclusion of the physical destruction criterion. Writing in 1998 Kurt Jonassohn and Karin Björnson stated that the CPPCG was a legal instrument resulting from a diplomatic compromise. As such the wording of the treaty is not intended to be a definition suitable as a research tool, and although it is used for this purpose, as it has an international legal credibility that others lack, other definitions have also been postulated. Jonassohn and Björnson go on to say that for various reasons, none of these alternative definitions have gained widespread support.\n\n"}

She was found dead at her house on 28 April 8.30 pm by her mother Rajeswari. She was living with her mother who works as a casual labourer. Her father, Pappu, separated from the family was staying alone and found dead on 9 November 2017 due to natural causes. Police was puzzled in the initial stage with the paranoid mother, a daily wage worker and the dysfunctional family, they also had no close contacts/cordial relationship with the neighbors or relatives, this affected the case's progress initially among other factors.\n\nThe police found the body mutilated and disturbingly sliced. Forensics concluded the body injuries showed violence, possible torture and presence of alcohol. The report also noted that the culprit had used a sharp weapon to disembowel her. Jisha was stabbed over 30 times. Her chest was pierced with a dagger. The postmortem conducted at Allappuzha Medical college states that, severe infliction on the neck led to her death.\nAccording to forensic officials, samples of blood and saliva recovered have been sent for examination, and DNA is recorded for matching. Upon preliminary investigation, the police revealed that Jisha would have been murdered when she resisted the rape attempt. The investigators also probed into migrant workers in the area for any clue on the murder.\n\nThe crime took place in the backdrop of the Kerala Legislative elections, and hence gained momentum and focus from political parties. As a Dalit woman brutally murdered in her home in Perumbavoor, Justice for Jisha was the hashtag (#JusticeForJisha) used in the social media during April 2016 to quicken efforts for justice to Jisha by politicians and largely by people. The film industry also joined forces in demanding justice for Jisha. The government has declared to offer a financial consolation of Rs 10 lakh to the family of Jisha and a home will be provided for her parents. Also many artists and humanitarians pledged support to the case.\n\nThrough continuous search of the police and involvement of people, the Jisha murder case came through a breakthrough. A citizen hailing from Assam informed his doubts about a worker he knew to the Kerala police; following the lead they picked up the Assamese labourer, and learnt that 24-year-old Ameer-ul-Islam was the culprit and was arrested from Kancheepuram in Tamil Nadu. He admitted committing the gruesome murder of the woman in Perumbavoor. Police found that the crime was motivated by previous grudge and revenge and committed under the influence of alcohol. The alcoholic assailant observed Jisha's routine and waited to sexually assault her; in that effort and rage he killed her and when she asked for water moments before death he gave her alcohol that he had with him. DNA tests conducted, matched and the police also recovered the knife used by the perpetrator. Police also suspect Anarul Islam's involvement, a friend of Ameerul Islam who have fled after the murder news. He allegedly escaped from Assam before the arrest.\n\nFor premeditated murders, rape, and the use of disabling violent force, the verdict is usually life imprisonment or death sentence.\n\nThe case also has motivated the government to structure a policy to halt differentiating people overly as men and women, which creates stereotyped societal divide and asked media to regulate depictions of gender-negative stereotypes to cultivate gender equity, lessen the crimes as a long-term plan to a certain extent and to regulate yellow journalism in forms of discussions and unnecessary probings through media, primarily to minimize the impact of trauma. This case also made the government to actively saddle on the implementation of alcohol prohibition in a phased manner. The Ernakulam principal district and sessions court on Thursday 14 December 2017 life term imprisonment was awarded to Muhammed Ameer ul-Islam, an Assam native, in the sensational Jisha rape and murder case.\n"}

The mother who concealed the second baby, Joanne Hayes, was arrested and charged with the murder of the first baby, of which she was erroneously thought to be the mother. The Gardaí were forced to drop the charges four years later and a tribunal of inquiry (the \"Kerry Babies Tribunal\") was launched. Its report was critical of the Garda conduct of the investigations, and also concluded that Hayes had precipitated the death of her baby. Hayes has disputed this finding, and no charges were pressed. The parents and killer of the first baby have never been identified.\n\nOn 14 April 1984, a newborn baby boy was found dead of 28 stab wounds on White Strand beach at Caherciveen, County Kerry. A woman, Joanne Hayes from Abbeydorney, approximately 80 kilometres away, was known to have been pregnant, was arrested and she and her family confessed to the murder of the baby. However, they later withdrew their confessions and admitted instead that Hayes' baby had been born on the family farm, had died shortly after birth, and had been wrapped in a plastic bag and buried on the farm in secret. Tests showed that the baby whose body was found on the farm had the same blood type – O – as Hayes and its (married) father, Jeremiah Locke. However, the baby on the beach had blood group A. The Gardaí nevertheless insisted that Hayes had become pregnant simultaneously by two different men (through heteropaternal superfecundation) and had given birth to both children, killing the one found on the beach. Another theory put forward was that the baby's blood type had changed due to decomposition.\n\nHayes was charged with murder but the charge was thrown out by a judge, and the Kerry Babies Tribunal, headed by Mr Justice Kevin Lynch, was set up to investigate the behaviour of the Gardaí in the case. Judge Lynch found that Joanne Hayes killed the baby on the farm by choking it to stop it crying, in spite of state pathologist Dr John Harbison being unable to determine the cause of death. Judge Lynch rejected claims by the Hayes family that they had been assaulted by Gardaí, or that the confessions were obtained through coercion. Joanne Hayes had claimed that Gardaí slapped, threatened, and coerced her into making a false confession, and other family members had alleged that Gardaí used harassment and physical intimidation to get false confessions. Gene Kerrigan commented in 2006, \"In the opinion of some, the report never convincingly explained how people who were entirely innocent of any involvement whatever in stabbing a baby should make very detailed confessions that fitted into the facts of the baby found on the beach.\" The case was also noteworthy for having a psychiatrist admit under oath that the definition of \"sociopath\" he had used to describe Joanne Hayes in his testimony would apply to \"about half the population of the country\".\n\nThe case raised serious questions about the culture of the Garda Síochána, and the treatment of unmarried mothers in Irish society. Journalist Nell McCafferty's book about the case was titled \"A Woman to Blame\". Joanne Hayes co-wrote a book with John Barrett about the episode called \"My Story\". Four gardaí on the case took legal action against the authors and publishers of the book, as well as shops that sold it. They received out-of-court settlements totalling over €127,000.\n\nIn the aftermath of the case the murder squad was disbanded, and the four gardaí assigned to desk duties, in what was seen as a demotion. In 2004, Joanne Hayes offered to undergo a DNA test to establish that she was not the mother of the baby on the beach. However, one of the officers on the case, Gerry O'Carroll, also sought such a test, saying that he believed the tests will prove the superfecundation theory correct. \n\nThe parents or killer of the baby on the beach, later named \"Baby John\", have never been identified. The gravesite has been repeatedly vandalised, but no suspect has ever been identified for this either.\n\nA Garda review of the DNA evidence, announced on 16 January 2018, confirmed that Joanne Hayes was not the mother of the infant found at White Strand. Irish national media reported that Acting Garda Commissioner Dónall Ó Cualáin offered a full verbal and written apology to Joanne Hayes. This was followed by an apology from the Minister for Justice, Charlie Flanagan and the Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar. \n\nA new investigation into the circumstances of Baby John's death was also launched. In September 2018 it was reported that Gardaí were following up on aspects of the original investigation and engaged in house-to-house inquiries on Valentia Island (the island opposite the beach on which Baby John was discovered), as “part of the general investigation”.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48637164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48637164", "title": "Korean history textbook controversies", "text": "Korean history textbook controversies\n\nKorean textbook controversy refers to controversial content in government-approved history textbooks used in the secondary education (high schools) in South Korea. The controversies primarily concern portrayal of North Korea and the description of the regime of the South Korean president and dictator Park Chung-hee.\n\nThe controversy's origins can be traced at least to 2013, when the South Korea's Ministry of Education instructed publishers to revise their history textbooks. In 2015 the South Korean National Institute of Korean History announced plans to replace existing history textbooks in high schools with one authorized version by March 2017. The state-issued textbooks are to be written by a government-appointed panel of experts.\n\nIn the larger context, this controversy is a part of an ongoing dispute on whether the state should control the content of history textbooks, and possibly enforce a monopoly, or whether individual schools (or teachers) should be free to choose their own textbooks. South Korea used to have a state control over textbooks until the rules were relaxed in 2003 leading to the appearance of several competing textbooks used since, particularly since 2010.\n\nExisting textbooks have been criticized by the government as well as by the Korean right or conservative side for being too positive on North Korean topics, and for \"liberal, left-leaning\" bias. On the other hand, the left, also described as liberals and progressives, represented among others by \"The Hankyoreh\" newspaper, are critical of the changes such as removing any mentions of the Geochang massacre and excluding photos of the first North–South summit, which they have described as biased towards a conservative view of history and the state that lends legitimacy to the pre-democratic, authoritarian, conservative governments. In particular, the regime of Park Chung-hee, the father of the current Korean president, Park Geun-hye, is seen by liberals as given a \"white-wash\" treatment by the new revisions. The conservatives rebuke that the current textbooks describe Park Chung-hee and his predecessor, Rhee Syng-man, in an excessively negative manner. Other controversial topics involve the framing of the pro-democratic protests against Park's regime, or the inclusion of the story of Korean teenage heroine Yu Gwan-sun.\n\nLiberals had also criticized the action on the grounds that the government control over textbooks is limiting freedom of speech and spreading propaganda. As of October 22, 2015, a petition against the new textbook reform had over 50,000 signatures. The government has also been facing several lawsuits, including one by the current textbook authors who accuse the government of libel. The plan has been described as controversial, and has led to public protests. Over 400 Korean history professors have expressed their opposition to the proposal. Outside Korea, the proposal has been criticized by over 200 professors of Korean studies. An opinion poll showed the Korean public opinion divided into approximately 50% against the new textbook plan, and 36% in favor.\n\nSeveral commentators compared this to the comfort women issue, noting that with the recent government interference into the content of history books, South Korea is losing its moral high ground from which it previously criticized the Japanese government for its perceived historical textbook problems.\n\n\n"}

William \"Frog\" Edwards, only recently released from detention at Fort Yuma, ambushed a party of unarmed Union soldiers when they stopped at La Paz to purchase supplies. Edwards' attack killed one soldier instantly and left another mortally wounded. Edwards then fled into the desert where he died of exposure and dehydration.\n\nAfter the Confederates established their own Arizona Territory at Mesilla, New Mexico, in February 1862, the Union sent the California Column east to reinforce the Union Army engaged in the New Mexico Campaign. Confederate cavalry briefly occupied Tucson from February 28 until early May 1862, but withdrew soon after the skirmmish at Picacho Peak. The following year General James H. Carleton arrested several California secessionists bound for Texas and detained them at Fort Yuma; William \"Frog\" Edwards was one of these detainees. La Paz was one of a handful of mining settlements that had been established along the Colorado River. It was situated along an important army supply route that had been in use since the Yuma War. The army used the Colorado River to supply garrisons in Arizona. On the evening of May 20, 1863, the Colorado River steamer \"Cocopah\" arrived at La Paz en route to Fort Mohave. A small party of soldiers, under the command of Lieutenant James A. Hale of the 4th California Infantry, disembarked to purchase supplies at Cohn's Store.\n\nLurking in the shadows was William \"Frog\" Edwards, only recently released from jail at Fort Yuma. As the soldiers approached the store, Edwards opened fire with his revolver. Private Ferdinand Behn was killed instantly, Private Truston Wentworth was mortally wounded and died the following day, Private Thomas Gainor was severely wounded, but recovered. One bystander was also struck and suffered a serious wound. Lieutenant Hale immediately searched the town with his remaining men but did not find Edwards. Lieutenant Hale returned to Fort Yuma aboard the \"Cocopah\" with his dead and wounded the following day. In response to Edwards' attack, a troop of forty men was deployed to hunt him down. Edwards was found several days later in the desert, where he apparently died of exposure and dehydration.\n\n"}

{"id": "239213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=239213", "title": "Madge Oberholtzer", "text": "Madge Oberholtzer\n\nMadge Augustine Oberholtzer (November 10, 1896 – April 14, 1925) was an American woman whose rape and murder played a critical role in the demise of the second incarnation of the Ku Klux Klan. In March 1925, while working for the state of Indiana on an adult literacy campaign, she was kidnapped by D. C. Stephenson, Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan. Holding her captive in his private train car, he raped and tortured her. She died from a combination of a staphylococcal infection from her injuries and kidney failure from mercury chloride poisoning, which she took while held captive in an attempt to commit suicide.\n\nFollowing the suicide attempt, Stephenson's men returned Oberholtzer to her home, assuming her injuries would soon prove fatal and believing their influential leader was immune to any prosecution. However, his victim regained consciousness long enough to give a signed statement to police. She described Stephenson's assaults which led to his conviction at trial and led to the rapid decline of KKK membership in Indiana.\n\nBorn to German-American parents, Oberholtzer grew up in Indianapolis, where her father worked as a postal clerk and her family belonged to the Irvington Methodist Church. She studied English, mathematics, zoology and logic at Butler College in Irvington, but dropped out at the end of her junior year without saying why. Through her life, Oberholtzer lived with her parents in the Irvington area of Indianapolis. By the time she met Stephenson, she was the manager of the Indiana Young People's Reading Circle, a special section of the Indiana Department of Public Instruction. However, she heard rumors that her job and the Reading Circle program were about to be eliminated due to budget cuts.\n\nOberholtzer met her murderer while attending Indiana Governor Edward L. Jackson's inauguration party at the Athletic Club on January 12, 1925. In her dying statement, Oberholtzer said Stephenson asked her for a date several times after the banquet, but she refused. However, she eventually agreed and they had dinner together. Following that date, Stephenson called Oberholtzer on the phone several times. She finally agreed to meet him for dinner at the Washington Hotel in Indianapolis.\n\nThey began seeing each other more frequently, and she acted as his aide during the 1925 session of the Indiana General Assembly, carrying messages from his office to his friends. She also helped him write a nutrition book, \"One Hundred Years of Health\". Using her Reading Circle connections, she intended to help him sell the book to school libraries throughout the state. However, she ended her relationship with him after attending a party at his mansion. They would not meet again until Sunday, March 15.\n\nAbout 10:00 p.m. that day, Oberholtzer returned home after an evening with a friend. Her mother told her that Stephenson's secretary had called and said he was leaving for Chicago. He wanted her to call him before he left. She called Stephenson, and he told her he would try to protect the Reading Circle program and her job if she agreed to see him. She changed into a black velvet dress, and a bodyguard she named as \"Mr Gentry\" arrived and escorted her to Stephenson's mansion a few blocks away. When she arrived, Stephenson, his chauffeur, Gentry, and another bodyguard Oberholtzer named as \"Clenck\" took her into the kitchen and forced her to drink whiskey until she became sick. The four men then took her upstairs, and Stephenson took a revolver from a dresser drawer and forced her to approach him at gunpoint.\n\nOberholtzer said the men took her to the garage and forced her into Stephenson's car. Before they left, Stephenson told Clenck to stay behind and tell his associate Claude Worley that he was going to Chicago for a business meeting. When they reached the railroad station, Stephenson and Gentry forced Oberholtzer onto Stephenson's private train to Chicago. No sooner had they entered the train's compartment coach, than Stephenson grabbed the bottom of her dress and pulled it over her head. He then grabbed her hands, tore off the rest of her clothes, pushed her into the lower bed, and raped her repeatedly. He also bit her all over her body. Oberholtzer was still intoxicated and unable to resist.\n\nShe finally passed out, after her attacker. Upon waking she said, \"The law will get their hands on you!\" Because his Klan connections gave him tremendous political power, Stephenson laughed and replied, \"I am the law in Indiana.\" An examination of her body later revealed deep bite wounds were on her face, neck, breasts, back, legs, ankles, and tongue.\n\nFollowing the assault, Gentry and Stephenson dressed Oberholtzer and told her they would be stopping in Hammond, Indiana. Stephenson and Oberholtzer, assisted by Gentry, checked into the Indiana Hotel. Stephenson forced her to say she was his wife so they could share the same room. Stephenson forced her to write a telegram to her mother, saying she had decided to go to Chicago with him. While Stephenson was sleeping, Oberholtzer grabbed his revolver to kill herself, but changed her mind, fearing it would dishonor her mother. Instead, she decided to commit suicide by taking poison. The next morning, she convinced Stephenson to call Shorty and tell him to come to the hotel so she could purchase a black silk hat.\n\nShe bought the hat, then asked Shorty to drive her to a drug store to buy some rouge. She bought an entire box of mercuric chloride tablets. Oberholtzer returned to her room, but was still weakened from her wounds Stephenson had inflicted on her and only managed to swallow six tablets. She vomited blood throughout the remainder of the day. Stephenson insisted that he would not take her to a hospital unless she agreed to go to a nearby chapel and marry him, However, he panicked and ordered Shorty to drive them back to Indianapolis as soon as possible. When he was asked what had happened, a bodyguard said she had been in a car accident.\n\nOberholtzer's parents immediately called a doctor, but there was nothing that could be done to save her. On March 28, she told what had happened to her in a signed statement. She died on April 14, 1925 from a staph infection from the bites, plus kidney failure from the mercury poisoning. She was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery in Indianapolis.\n\nStephenson was indicted on charges of rape and second-degree murder. The doctor who had examined Oberholtzer testified that the injuries she received were sufficient to have killed her, as her wounds developed an infection that reached her lungs and kidneys.\" \n\nStephenson's attorney claimed Oberholtzer had committed suicide, saying the rapist could not have anticipated her behavior. The prosecution countered that based on medical testimony, prompt medical attention might have saved her life. During the closing statements, the prosecutor decried Stephenson as a \"destroyer of virtue and womanhood\". The jury found him guilty of second degree murder, rape, and kidnapping, and the court sentenced him to life in prison. The State Supreme Court rejected his appeal. This case is still taught in law schools as showing an enlargement of the causal relationships that define homicide.\n\nThe brutal attack on Madge Oberholtzer so outraged most members of the Klan that entire lodges quit \"en masse\", and membership dropped by the tens of thousands. The scandal destroyed the KKK in Indiana, and in the following two years, the Indiana KKK lost more than 178,000 members, nearly disappearing.\n\nDenied a pardon in 1926, Stephenson started talking to the \"Indianapolis Times\", giving the names of officials who had accepted bribes and payments from the Klan. The \"Times\" investigated the Klan in the state. The state finally indicted several high-ranking officials, including Governor Ed Jackson and the head of the Republican Party in Marion County. Other local officials resigned when facing charges. The \"Times\" investigation revealed widespread political corruption, which helped destroy the Klan in Indiana and nationwide. By February 1928, Indiana Klan rosters had dropped to just 4,000, from a peak of more than 250,000 members in 1925.\n\nStephenson was paroled on March 23, 1950, but he violated the conditions of his parole by disappearing around September 25, 1950. He was captured in Minneapolis on 15 December, and was ordered by the court in 1951 to serve another 10 years. He was paroled on December 22, 1956, on the condition that he leave Indiana and never return.\n\nIn 1961, Stephenson was arrested in Tennessee at age 70 on charges of sexually assaulting a sixteen-year-old girl. However, the charges were dropped on grounds of insufficient evidence. He died 5 years later in 1966.\n\n\n"}

Typically, the mule is paid for services with a small part of the money transferred. Money mules are often dupes recruited on-line for what they think is legitimate employment, not aware that the money they are transferring is the product of crime. The money is transferred from the mule's account to the scam operator, typically in another country. Similar techniques are used to transfer illegal merchandise.\n\nMules recruited online are typically used to transfer the proceeds from online fraud, such as phishing scams, malware scams or scams that operate around auction sites like eBay. After money or merchandise has been stolen, the criminal employs a mule to transfer the money or goods, hiding the criminal's true identity and location from the victim of the crime and the authorities.\nBy using instant payment mechanisms such as Western Union, the mule allows the thief to transform a reversible and traceable transaction into an irreversible and untraceable one.\n\nMoney mules are complicit and risk criminal prosecution and long jail sentences. Commonly, they are recruited with job advertisements for \"payment processing agents\", \"money transfer agents\", \"local processors\", and other similar titles; the real benefit to the criminals is not the work carried out by the mule, but that the criminals are distanced from the risky, visible transfer. Some money mules are recruited by an attractive member of the opposite sex. After deducting a relatively small payment for themselves, candidates are asked to accept funds and to forward them to a third party, which they can do from home. Legitimate companies use escrow services for this kind of work. Criminals trading in stolen or illegally acquired goods use similar tactics to recruit mules who receive packages and forward them to mail drops not traceable to the criminal.\n\nIn 2010, The FBI Cyber Crimes Task Force, composed of Federal, State, and Local law enforcement, charged more than 37 defendants involved in a highly organized money mule scheme, facilitated by the Zeus Financial Trojan. This group of money mules opened several bank accounts, using both real and fake identification, to receive stolen funds from compromised bank accounts, withdraw the stolen money, then wire the stolen funds overseas. These money mules facilitated the theft of over $3 million from victim bank accounts. \n\nBitcoin ATMs were reported by Brian Krebs in 2016 to be rising in popularity for money muling.\n\n"}

Teams from Europe and Australia competed in the competitions, including a number of interstate entries. Nullarbor was a breakthrough for the Australian demoscene, as the last demo party in Western Australia was the C party in 1994, which was 12 years before Nullarbor. The last demo party in Australia was Coven 2001. Nullarbor broke a 5-year demo party drought in Australia. As a result, Nullarbor attracted a record number of first releases and new demo groups. Game Developers that were also formed in order to compete at the event and added a significant contribution to the Perth game development scene, including the formation of new digital content companies.\n\nIn 2007 nullarbor was officially renamed to \"Interzone nullarbor\", to reflect major sponsorship by Interzone games. It became one of the world's biggest demoparties with over 10,000 visitors, largely thanks to taking place as part of the GO3 electronic entertainment expo and conference in the Perth Convention Exhibition Centre. Some sources report up to 30,000 visitors. The nullarbor competition expanded in 2007 to include animation, pixel art, and music competitions.\n\nThe 2008 competition saw a return to the traditional demoparty style taking place at The Bakery art venue in Northbridge, Western Australia. The competition was also extended to include a pitch competition and allow for machinima entries.\n\nAustralia obtained a second demoparty in 2007, the Syntax Demoparty in Melbourne, and as of 2008 Perth has had a strong presence in the Local and Global Game Jam events. Subsequently Nullarbor events have not been held since 2009.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14556668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14556668", "title": "Occupational sexism", "text": "Occupational sexism\n\nOccupational sexism (also called sexism in the work place and employment sexism) refers to any discriminatory practices, statements, actions, etc. based on a person's sex that are present or occur in a place of employment.\n\nSocial role theory may explain one reason for why occupational sexism exists. Historically women's place was in the home, while the males were in the workforce. This division consequently formed expectances for both men and women in society and occupations. These expectances in turn gave rise to gender stereotypes that play a role in the formation of sexism in the work place, i.e., occupational sexism.\n\nAccording to a reference there are three common patterns associated with social role theory that might help explain the relationship between the theory and occupational sexism. The three patterns are as follows:\nThese patterns can work as the fore ground for the commonality of occupational stereotypes.\nOne example of this in action is the expectancy value model. This model describes how expectances may be linked to gender discrimination in occupations. For example, females are expected by society to be more successful in health related fields while men are expected to be more successful in science related fields. Therefore, men are discriminated against when attempting to enter health related fields, and females are discriminated against when attempting to enter science related fields.\n\nOccupational sexism is caused by the social role theory and different stereotypes in society. The social role theory has many effects on women, many of them pertaining to occupations. Before World War II, women were usually found in the home, performing womanly duties such as cooking, cleaning, and taking care of children. However, since World War II, women have shifted the gender roles and have began performing the jobs that men would have typically been performing, such as joining the military, becoming mechanics, driving trucks, etc. The original occupations women participated in were based on the social role theory, but women have been attempting to counteract the theory by participating in jobs that would be seen as \"unusual\" for them.\n\nDespite multiple acts attempting to seal the gap between women and men in the workplace, women are still deemed as inferior based on stereotypes embedded in society caused by the social role theory. Whether it is intentional or not, there is discrimination of women based on gender related stereotypes. It has been studied by Tiina Likki, who is a part of a Behavioral Insights Team, that removing stereotypes about women in occupations is difficult because despite job training, people still acquire stereotypical thoughts. Likki has been committed to improving gender inequality in the labor market; she continues to use her knowledge of sexism within occupations to make others aware of these underlying issues. Many stereotypes are embedded into our lives through society, which causes a constant continuation. This makes it difficult to steer away from these stereotypes as they have been prominent in society for hundreds of years.\n\nEconomists Kerwin Kofi Charles, Jonathan Guryan, and Jessica Pan have determined that where women choose to live and work determines the sexism that is encountered.. These economists used research and statistics to show that women are affected by the social role theory from childhood and it follows them well into adulthood . Women experience gender roles as children; they can be as young as five years ole in elementary school when they begin to be affected by the social role theory. Gender roles are rooted into society and causes a continuation of sexism that follows women into their occupations.\n\nIn occupations, women rarely are awarded the managerial positions.This is caused by sexual roles within organizations. Men are viewed as superior in occupations because of the stereotype that they are stronger and more capable of dealing with their emotions than women. This is a possible reason for why women have trouble obtaining positions in occupations that put them above men. If women were to rise to a higher position in an occupation, there is likelihood that they will be treated differently than if a male were to obtain that same position.\n\nDepression and mental health issues are also effects of the social role theory. In general, women are found to be almost twice as depressed as men. A possible explanation for the larger numbers of depression in women compared to men is the amount of sexism faced in occupations having an emotional effect. Women are becoming more depressed as a result of these stereotypical ideas against them. There is an intense amount of pressure placed on women when they encounter certain stereotypes and sexual roles in the workplace and this can take a toll on their mental health.\n\nThe idea of gender roles has caused different reactions in women in modern society as well. Women have been fighting against gender roles and the stereotype that women can only perform certain duties in occupations.There is an entire feminist movement that focuses on the inequality of women in different aspects of society, including the treatment of women in occupations based on gender roles. Feminists have been working towards gaining equality between men and women and eliminating the social role theory, along with stereotypical assumptions, to ensure women obtain and keep their basic human rights.\n\nSexism also arises in the workplace through the beliefs concerning which emotions are appropriate for employees to show. Stereotypically, women are expected to be kind and nurturing, communal, and modest, while they are not expected to display anger. Expressing an emotion that doesn't line up with people's beliefs about gender-appropriate behavior could lead to being given a lower status at work, and consequently, a lower wage.\n\nA 2008 study found that men who expressed anger in the workplace were given a higher status, while women who expressed anger in the workplace were given a lower status, regardless of their actual position in the company. A trainee and a CEO who were female were both given a low status when displaying anger. Additionally, women who displayed anger in the workplace were assumed to have something internal influencing their anger, as opposed to having an external reason to be angry. Men more often had their anger attributed to an external cause.\n\nThe expression of anger is believed to be related to status, as anger is considered a status emotion. Positive impressions of those who display anger are reserved for people who are stereotypically conferred a higher status. A 2007 study found that male employees who were in a subordinate position in the workplace displayed anger toward higher status employees, while female employees in a subordinate position displayed anger toward higher status employees much less frequently. This suggests that the stereotypical norm of men displaying anger carries over into the workplace, while the norm of women restraining displays of anger also carries over. It also suggests that, although men in low level positions in the workplace possess a low status in this context, they may carry over the higher status that comes with their gender into the workplace. Women do not possess this high status; therefore the low status that low level women possess in the workplace is the sole status that matters.\n\n\nHoward J. Wall, an economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, states that women make a median hourly income that was equal to 83.8 percent of what men make. In the late 1980s, studies saw that about a fair amount of the gender pay gap was due to differences in the skills and experience that women bring to the labor market and about 28 percent was due to differences in industry, occupation, and union status among men and women. Accounting for these differences raised the female/male pay ratio in the late 1980s from about 72% to about 88%, leaving around 12 percent as an \"unexplained\" difference.\n\nThe majority of occupational deaths occur among men. In one US study, 93% of deaths on the job involved men, with a death rate approximately 11 times higher than women. The industries with the highest death rates are mining, agriculture, forestry, fishing, and construction, all of which employ more men than women. Deaths of members in the military is currently above 90% men.\n\nSociologists, economists, and politicians have proposed several theories about the causes of gender wage gap. Some believe that woman's salaries are based on the career path that women choose. They stipulate that the women chose low-paying jobs, clerical work, and to work in services (see also Pink-collar worker). This is said to be relatively true at time because many women who select these careers find it easier to continue working these simple jobs rather that quit them if they choose to raise a family.\n\nUniversities have been blamed for being sexist in their hiring decisions. In particular, men have been reported to be biased towards male applicants. However, recent data suggest that women have caught up, at least when it comes to the number of faculty positions offered to women (see Table).\nData in table from 89 US universities where women were interviewed for tenure-track jobs.\n\nOccupational sexism become institutionalized in the U.S. today when women were originally able to join the workforce by men primarily in the 20th Century and were paid up to two-thirds of what male's income were. Since then it is now thought of as \"good business\" to hire women because they could perform many jobs similar to men, yet give them lesser wages. Groups like the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization for Women are established to fight against this discrimination, leading to the creation of groundbreaking laws such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963. However, identifying and challenging sex discrimination in the workplace (on legal grounds) has been argued as being extremely difficult for the average person to attempt and even harder to prove in court.\n\nOne successful sexism case that reached the U.S. Supreme Court was \"Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins\". Ann Hopkins, a senior manager at Price Waterhouse, sued her employer, arguing that failure to promote her to partner stemmed not from her abilities—which had been undeniably stellar—but from certain partners thinking she didn't carry herself in a feminine-enough manner. The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in Hopkins' favor, and a lower court ordered her employer to award her partnership and pay her back wages lost during the case.\n\nAnother Supreme Court case, \"Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.\", saw a judgment in favor of plaintiff Lilly Ledbetter—which had awarded her back pay and damages for several years of receiving disproportionately low pay in comparison to her male counterparts—overturned because she waited too long to file suit. After a 5-4 decision, the majority cited reasoning that \"Federal law states that 'employees must file their discrimination complaints within 180 days of the incident,'\" a task that dissenting Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg claimed was unreasonable considering that quite often women have no reason to suspect discrimination until certain unfair patterns develop and they are made aware of them.\n\n"}

Nearly any type of music can be played at one of these concerts, and they frequently feature pop, folk, classical, or jazz artists. Largely electronic music, such as techno, are seldom featured because of the difficulties of staging the event. Some open-air concerts known as festivals take place over several days and feature a large number of different artists.\n\nOpen-air concerts take great amounts of planning, to make sure that the stage is visible from the entire audience seating area. Frequently, the area directly in front of the stage is kept clear for dancing. In the case of punk concerts and other energetic music, this area becomes a mosh pit filled with a violently moving crowd. Generally, care is taken to keep the dancers off the stage, however at punk concerts, stagediving and other audience interaction are more common.\n\nOpen-air concerts can be free for the audience, or may sell tickets for entrance. With ticketed events, these concerts are staged in planned, fenced-in areas, to avoid non-paying visitors. The fencing used is often temporary.\n\nRain can wreak havoc at an open-air concert. The grass in front of the stage is often heavily damaged by concert-goers, and may need replanted after the event. Therefore, it is common that visitors get a partial refund on the ticket price if they donate a sack of grass seed at the entrance.\n\nConcerts can take place at a location not served by the public electricity grid. In these cases, the concert promoters set up emergency power generators.\n\nMany open-air concerts are very loud, and without the insulation of a building or arena to contain the noise, this also takes an amount of planning, to assure that the concert does not bother the neighbors. Often, these events are staged at a distance from residential areas. Many areas have noise regulations in place limiting the areas in which these large events can take place.\n\nFor larger events, the stage is built from scaffolding and often includes a roof to protect electrical equipment from potential rain. This scaffolding rig holds lighting and other special effects equipment. Loudspeakers are frequently mounted to the right and left of the stage in towers, with the mixing console placed before the stage.\n\nSupport functions are often placed in areas surrounding the audience. Concessions are sold from trailers and other temporary structures. If plumbing facilities are available, toilets are found in this area; in areas without plumbing, chemical portable toilets are used.\n"}
{"id": "28030373", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28030373", "title": "Orange Socks", "text": "Orange Socks\n\nOrange Socks is the informal name given to an American unidentified female who was murdered on October 31, 1979 in Georgetown, Texas. The body was found naked, except for the pair of orange socks from which her nickname was derived. She had been strangled, and was believed to have died only hours before the discovery. Henry Lee Lucas confessed to and was convicted of her murder, though doubts have been raised about his complicity in this crime.\n\nThe victim, who was white and had been sexually assaulted, was found in a culvert on Interstate 35, after being dragged to and thrown over a guardrail. The cause of death was ruled as strangulation, as a large amount of bruising was visible on her neck. Other bruises were also visible, caused by the body having been dropped from the overpass. \n\nThe victim's legs were unshaven with a large number of insect bites. She had very long toenails, her fingernails were painted and a hairline scar was observed beneath the chin. Despite her injuries, the victim had not broken a bone during her life. She had reportedly suffered from salpingitis, due to previously contracting gonorrhea. She had ten-inch-long brown hair with a reddish tint, hazel eyes, and her age ranged from 15 to 30 years. She was approximately five feet eight inches to five feet ten inches tall, and weighed between 140 and 160 pounds. Two of her teeth were missing; the remainder were well-maintained, although they showed little sign of dental care, such as fillings or crowns. A silver ring was found on her hand, containing an abalone or mother of pearl stone. Her ears were pierced.\n\nAlso at the scene, a towel, likely used in place of a sanitary napkin, was found along with the body, as though the victim was attempting to control her menstruation without having to spend money on tampons. One of two matchbooks found at the scene belonged to a hotel from Henryetta, Oklahoma, which supported the theory she was a hitchhiker or drifter.\n\nIn 1982, serial killer Henry Lee Lucas confessed to her murder, although there was no physical evidence that he had been involved in the killing, sexual assault or disposing of the body. In an interview, he stated that he picked her up in Oklahoma, where they had sex. He asked her for sex again while he was driving; he claimed that at this, Orange Socks said \"not right now\" and attempted to leave his car, at which point he killed her and raped her corpse. He then drove her body to Georgetown. Lucas told authorities that the victim had stated her name as being \"Joanie\" or \"Judy\". He had previously showed officers how he had supposedly dragged her body over the guardrail when taken to the location where her body was found.\n\nOne report claims that at the time of Orange Socks' murder, Lucas was working in Florida, whereas the murder took place in Texas. Interrogators also stated that he had contradicted himself several times when confessing to the murder, and his defense also stated that he was shown images of the crime scene before his interview. In order to have traveled to Oklahoma, to Texas and back to Florida, it was estimated that he would have had to drive at an average of seventy miles an hour, without stopping, which many find unlikely. Lucas later recanted this statement after his conviction in 1984 and, by involvement of the then state governor, George W. Bush, his death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment, as the death of Orange Socks was the only case that resulted in his receiving a capital punishment. Lucas had a history of dubious confessons, something that led others to doubt his truthfulness (he confessed to upwards of 3,000 murders). Lucas himself recanted his confessions, stating that the only murder he had committed was that of his mother, Viola.\n\nAfter learning that Lucas' sentence had been reduced, the mother of Suzanne Bowers told reporters that she was opposed to the decision along with several others, as Lucas had confessed to murdering the 12-year-old in 1984.\n\nThe \"Orange Socks\" case had been featured twice on \"America's Most Wanted\" since the murder took place. An anonymous woman called to the program on one occasion claiming she had seen Orange Socks hitchhiking the day of her murder, but the lead has not generated any new information.\n\nIn 2001, a missing woman's photograph surfaced that resembled Orange Socks. DNA testing, however, did not match. Another report suggests that the victim was a woman who had disappeared in the 1970s, together with her abusive boyfriend. Former missing person Martha Morrison was speculated by some to possibly have been the unidentified woman, but she was eventually ruled out. Morrison's remains were identified in 2015 as a Jane Doe found in Washington the same year she disappeared. Several other missing women have also been excluded from the case.\n\nOn the 37th anniversary of her discovery, new reconstructions of Orange Socks were released by the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. The organization also entered her into their database.\n\nIn May 2018, law enforcement stated they planned on examining the victim's ring as well as run tests to identify the location the victim's socks were made. A book of matches found near the body were traced to a hotel in Oklahoma but couldn't identify anyone matching her description in the records.\n\nAccording to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, the following missing people have been ruled out as being Orange Socks.\n\n\n"}

Some European countries shared unity across denominations while others did not. In Germany, Catholic and Protestant differences caused tension while Austria-Hungary did not unify Catholic services.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Church received much of its income from pilgrimage. The First World War stopped pilgrimage and a heavy tax was required of those who didn’t want to fight in the war. The factors caused the Greek Orthodox Church to borrow large amounts of money that left the Church defective during the duration of the war.\n\nAs Christian establishments dealt with the effects of the First World War, some were able to maintain themselves and prosper while others experienced great loss. The war changed the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem and united them over a common attitude of opposition towards Jewish immigration. The war also caused the formations of new religious groups such as The Palestinian Association of Egypt. The war increased religious focus on custody of the Holy Land and local issues.\n\nWhen the United States entered the First World War, the most prominent religions groups were Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. The conflict served to unite these religions despite their differences and dissolve the idea the Jews and Catholics were inferior to Protestants.The loyalty to the same God and same country helped soldiers put aside their religious differences for the good of the war. Tense conditions still existed between these three religious but efforts were made to provide equal opportunities to each group. A committee called the Committee of Six represented the three faiths in the formation of new policy in the United States.\n\nWorld War I also brought a focus on the afterlife and developed Spiritualism into a religion. Spirituality was enticing to those dealing with death and loss of faith after the First World War because of their beliefs in speaking with the dead and explaining mysteries about death, things that some felt Christianity couldn’t satisfy. Stobart, a British woman in charge of a hospital during the Second World War, became a spiritualist leader following the end of the war. She was enticed by Spiritualism because it offered more opportunities for her as a woman than other traditional religions did.\n\nFor national churches such as The Church of England, war was heavily supported. They felt that it was their duty to pray for soldiers because they needed the grace of God. They believed that soldiers would pass through purgatory because violence was opposed to the church's belief in peace. Despite these conflicting beliefs, church leaders supported the war. Bishop Gore, a bishop of the Church of England, was one that fantasized and downplayed the realities of war in his attempt to support it.\n\nKnown for their bravery, Sikhs were more prominently found in the Indian army. Although the army also consisted of individuals from other religions, many people belonging to faiths, such as Hinduism were rarely found in combat. Regiments were even formed strictly with members of the Sikh religion. The Indian Army formed an allegiance with the British Empire and participated in a few battles during World War I, including the Battle of Gallipoli. \n\nMembers from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints’ participation on World War I provided an opportunity for members of the Church to clearly define themselves to the world. In a time where many negative commentaries about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints was circulating, the War served to help in efforts to accurately portray the Church.” During this time, “Mormons” were accused of being disloyal to the United States of America. In 1886, a district attorney for the state of Utah was quoted to have said “We wish to say that the so-called Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is steeped in disloyalty to the Government of the United States…We say, more than that, that the purpose of this Church here, one of its particular purposes, is to overthrow the American home and overturn the family altar in this country.\"\n\nThe Latter-day Saint soldier’s active duty in the war fought against the idea that members of the LDS church were not loyal to their country. In fact, many LDS men enlisted in the military for the soul purpose of trying to prove such accusations as false. Such Soldiers also left notable impacts on their fellow comrades throughout their active participation in military service.”\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is notoriously known for its missionary work, and the case was not any different during the early years of the “Mormon Church”. During World War I, however, missionary work was negatively affected. Many of those who would otherwise serve missions for the Church, enrolled in military service, limiting the number of men available to become LDS missionaries. Areas where LDS Missionaries previously proselyted, became too dangerous for such activity and as a result all LDS Missionaries were taken out of Europe.\n\nWorld War I made women into more influential figures in society, due to their symbolic necessity in representing their faith. It was women of faith that actively engaged in provided aid, emotionally, physically, and spiritually, to Soldiers in need during the violence of the War. Additionally, women assisted in actual religious pursuits and activities. They held and supported positions that would not have been previously available to them.\n\nCatholic women were remembered helping Priests who were overloaded with the amount of spiritual and physical aid they felt needed to be administered. They worked under such responsibilities to help people come back to their faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nWomen in the Protestant faith participated in similar ways, including providing care packages for Soldiers. They even took over parishes when the pastors of such parishes were busy in other endeavors during the war. It was during this time that women were symbols during the war of religious faith and devotion to supporting their countries.\n\nJews served in the war for several different reasons. They desired to unite with their fellow citizens and join with them in combat. The war also allowed for Jewish people to define themselves to the world. A huge driving factor for many Jews was the desire to engage in conflict against Russia, a nation that was known for being oppressive to Jews. Many felt the need to help their fellow Jewish comrades in dire circumstances. \n\nDue to the destruction of Hasburg Monarchy and the Russian Empire, new nations were formed that developed different relations with the Jewish people than before World War I. The Jews became more recognizable and distinctive in the new states established thus creating greater Jewish influence. \n\nDuring World War I, the Ottoman Empire was under an immense amount of pressure to engage in the conflict. Leaders of the empire attempted to maintain neutrality for a time, but the pressure for inclusion only increased. The official religion of the Ottoman Empire during this time, was Islam, making joining the war was a topic of controversy in the Islamic State, as Muslim law includes strict guidelines in regards to involvement in wars. \n\nIn October of 1914, the Ottoman Empire faced enough pressure from Germany to agree to commence an attack on the Russian Navy stationed in the Black Sea. The Ottoman Empire deceptively claimed that they were attacked by Russia, hiding the fact that their presence in the Black Sea was to deliberately cause conflict with Russia. This event ultimately led to Russia's involvement in World War I.\n\nMany argue that the Ottoman Empire's involvement was strictly due to benefits they desired for the Islamic State. Muslim scholars have argued that their participation was really an attempt to enlarge the Islamic State and grow in power and influence. \n"}

SIEV is the acronym used by the surveillance authority for any boat that has entered Australian waters without prior authorisation and the X is a designation where a tracking number has not or is yet to be assigned, in accordance with Australian Government orders. It is also used by author Tony Kevin, to refer to a dilapidated Indonesian fishing boat that was en route from Sumatra to Christmas Island carrying over 400 asylum seekers. It sank in international waters on 19 October 2001, just south of the Indonesian island of Java, killing 353 people. The tragedy was politically controversial in Australia, as it occurred during an election campaign at a time when asylum seekers and border protection were major issues.\n\nThe SIEV-X incident occurred during the 2001 Australian Federal election campaign. The Tampa affair had focused national media's attention on the issue of asylum seekers. Prime Minister John Howard claimed his policy would prevent people smuggling and stop the boats of asylum seekers from arriving in Australia. The Howard Government had issued instructions to the Royal Australian Navy and the Australian Federal Police (AFP) to prevent any refugees from reaching Australia via boat. The AFP set about a campaign of disrupting organised people smugglers who operated with overcrowded and dangerous boats. The Royal Australian Navy began intercepting boats that entered Australian waters and transferring all people to Christmas Island.\n\nOn 18 October 2001, a small, unnamed 19.5 metre by 4 metre Indonesian fishing boat departed Bandar Lampung, Indonesia, with 421 passengers on board. On the 19th, the boat sank during a storm in Indonesian waters about 70 km south of Java. The area was \"legally in international waters\" but \"within both Indonesia's\" Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) \"and Indonesia's internationally designated zone of search and rescue responsibility\". It also fell inside a temporary Australian border protection surveillance area around the Australian external territory of Christmas Island (which is some 1700 km from mainland Australia). This latter designation was an internal planning and operational tool used by the Australian authorities to deter people smuggling. It had no legal validity and conferred no responsibility in international law.\n\nApproximately 146 children, 142 women and 65 men died. On 20 October, 44 survivors were rescued by an Indonesian fishing boat, the Indah Jaya Makmur. A 45th survivor was rescued about twelve hours later by another boat, the Surya Terang.\n\nThe International Organization for Migration stated that it had expected such an event to occur due to \"the way the people smugglers pack these boats\".\n\nOn 20 February 2002, the Australian Senate Select Committee inquiring into ‘A Certain Maritime Incident’ met for the first time. Its primary task was to investigate the children overboard affair, however its terms of reference also included investigating “operational procedures observed by the Royal Australian Navy and by relevant Commonwealth agencies to ensure the safety of asylum seekers on vessels entering or attempting to enter Australian waters”. \n\nThe committee investigated the SIEV-X sinking, and concluded that \"... it [is] extraordinary that a major human disaster could occur in the vicinity of a theatre of intensive Australian operations and remain undetected until three days after the event, without any concern being raised within intelligence and decision making circles.\" While no government department was found to be to blame for the tragedy, the Committee was surprised that there had been no internal investigations into any systemic problems which could have allowed the Australian government to prevent it from occurring.\"\n\n \n\nSince 2003, Steve Biddulph worked with the Uniting Church in Australia to build a suitable memorial for victims and survivors of the SIEV X sinking. On Sunday, 15 September 2006, a 'temporary' memorial was erected at Weston Park in Canberra. The memorial, designed by Mitchell Donaldson of Queensland's Hillbrook Anglican School, consisted of 353 white poles, all decorated by schools, churches and community groups across Australia. While the ACT Government was supportive of the memorial, with Chief Minister Jon Stanhope opening the memorial, the then Howard Government tried to stop the memorial being constructed. The National Capital Authority claimed that it was not an approved structure.\n\nThe permanent memorial, involving over a thousand student and community artists, was dedicated in October 2007.\n\n\n\n"}

From mid-1942, the group's official name was the Norwegian Naval Independent Unit (NNIU). In October 1943, it became an official part of the Royal Norwegian Navy and was renamed the Royal Norwegian Naval Special Unit (RNNSU). The unit was operated initially by a large number of small fishing boats and later augmented by three fast and well-armed submarine chasers – , and .\n\nCrossings were mostly made during the winter under the cover of darkness. This meant the crews and passengers had to endure very heavy North Sea conditions, with no lights and constant risk of discovery by German aircraft or patrol boats. There was also the possibility of being captured whilst carrying out the mission on the Norwegian coast. \n\nEarly on it was decided that camouflage was the best defence, and the boats were disguised as working fishing boats and the crew as fishermen. The fishing boats were armed with light machine guns concealed inside oil drums placed on deck. The operation was under constant threat from German forces, and several missions went awry, of which the Telavåg tragedy in the spring of 1942 was a prime example. Several fishing boats were lost during the early operations, but after receiving the three submarine chasers there were no more losses.\n\nWhen Germany launched \"Operation Weserübung\", the invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, French and British troops and ships were sent to help the Norwegians. Several coastal towns were bombed and destroyed by the Germans, and during April and May, the British ships had to retreat from mid-Norway. On 29 April, left a devastated Molde with King Haakon VII, Crown Prince Olav, members of the Norwegian Government, and most of the gold from the Norwegian National Bank. In northern Norway, the fighting lasted for another month. A few weeks after the occupation began, the first boats of an \"armada\" of fishing vessels and other boats began to arrive in Shetland. Some boats made several journeys across the North Sea carrying refugees.\n\nMany of the boats were \"Hardanger Cutters\", with a straight bow and long stern from the Bergen area, others the more rounded \"Møre Cutters\", from the area around Ålesund. It appeared that the \"Møre Cutter\" was the strongest and best-fitted for the heavy weather in the North Sea. The boats were of many kinds and shapes, but most of those used as a \"Shetland Bus\", were from long, with two masts and equipped with a 30 to 70 hp single-cylinder semi-diesel engine, which made the characteristic \"tonk-tonk\" sound.\n\nIn late 1940, both the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and the Special Operations Executive (SOE) Norwegian Naval Independent Unit (not to be confused with another SOE Norwegian unit: the Norwegian Independent Company. No.1 or \"Kompani Linge\"), established a base in Lerwick (pronounced \"Lerrick\"); SIS later moved to Peterhead. They asked some of the skippers of the boats that were coming from Norway, if they would return to deliver agents and bring others back to Shetland. This went on throughout the winter of 1940–41. In early 1941 it was decided formally to establish a group of men and boats to assist the SIS and the SOE.\n\nThe main purpose of the group was to transfer agents in and out of Norway and provide them with weapons, radios and other supplies. They would also bring out Norwegians who feared arrest by the Germans. Sometimes the group was involved in special operations, like the failed attack on the German battleship , Operation Archery, the raids on Måløy and Operation Claymore in the Lofoten Islands.\n\nThe men put in charge of organizing the group were a British Army officer, Major Leslie Mitchell and his assistant, Lieutenant David Howarth RNVR. Upon their arrival in Shetland they commandeered Flemington House, (later named \"Kergord\"), in Weisdale, for their headquarters and they found a perfect location in Lunna Ness north of Lerwick, from which the boats could operate. Before then the boats had been moored in Cat Firth. Lunna Ness had a sheltered harbour and a small population that were not too curious about what was going on and Lunna House was used as accommodation for the boat crews. Whilst Mitchell stayed in Flemington, Howarth set up headquarters in Lunna House. Their whole staff consisted of three British sergeants; Almond, Sherwood and Olsen; Norman Edwards, a stenographer; Harald Albertsen, a Norwegian cook at Lunna and two maids in Flemington. During the first winter Flemington House was used to train saboteurs and house agents and to accommodate Norwegian refugees. Later the refugees were received in a special camp at the James Sutherland Herring Factory in Lerwick, administered by James Adie and his Norwegian-born wife.\n\nThe lack of a slipway and other repair facilities meant that at first the boats had to be repaired at Malakoff's in Lerwick. Later, they moved the boats and crews to Scalloway, where William Moore & Son had a mechanical workshop and where \"Prince Olav's Slipway\" was built. Harald Angeltveit and Johan Haldorsen were the head mechanics and Severin Roald became leader of the carpenters. All ship repairs were done there but Lunna Voe was still used for preparing special operations.\n\nDinapore House was headquarters for the base in Scalloway, while Flemington House became quarters for agents awaiting transport to Norway and for de-brief on return. A former net loft, owned by Nicolson & Co. became accommodation for the boat crews and was named \"Norway House\". Sevrin Roald's wife, Inga Roald, was the housekeeper. Flemington House was also on occasion visited by high-ranking officers like the Commander-in-chief, Scottish Command and the Admiral Commanding Orkney and Shetland. The most prominent guest was HKH Crown Prince Olav of Norway who visited in October 1942. Mitchell left the base in Scalloway in December 1942 and Captain Arthur William Sclater, known as \"Rogers\", became leader of operations; his Norwegian-born wife, Alice, acted as welfare officer for the crews.\n\nAt first, there were fourteen fishing boats of various sizes. The original Shetland Bus boat, the \"Aksel\", skippered by August Nærøy, departed for Bergen from Hamna Voe, on the west side of Lunna Ness, on 30 August 1941. The other crew on this first tour were Mindor Berge, Ivar Brekke, Andreas Gjertsen, and Bård Grotle. Fishing boats were used at first, but after some losses, it was decided that faster vessels were necessary. On 26 October 1943, the US Navy officially transferred the submarine chasers \"Hitra\", \"Vigra\", and \"Hessa\" to the Shetland Bus operation. These craft were long and powered by two 1,200 hp diesel engines, capable of a top speed of , with a normal cruising speed of . When the submarine chasers arrived, the group became an official part of the Royal Norwegian Navy and was renamed the Royal Norwegian Naval Special Unit (RNNSU).\nThey carried out more than 100 tours to Norway, with no loss of men or ships.\n\nOn 9 May 1945, \"Vigra\", commanded by Larsen, and \"Hitra\", by Eidsheim, entered the harbour of Lyngøy near Bergen in free Norway. The group had made 198 trips to Norway in fishing boats and submarine chasers, Leif Larsen completing 52 of them. The \"Shetland Bus\" had transported 192 agents and of weapons and supplies to Norway and had brought out 73 agents and 373 refugees. Forty-four members of the group were killed.\n\nThe crews of the Shetland Bus (\"Shetlandsgjengen\") were men of the coast, fishermen and sailors with detailed local knowledge. Most came over after the occupation, some with their own vessels, others with vessels that were \"stolen\" with the owner's approval. They were young men, most of them in their twenties, some even younger. Many of them did several tours in the spring and summer of 1940, evacuating British soldiers who had been stranded in Norway after the Norwegian Campaign and other British citizens living in Norway.\n\nLeif Larsen (9 January 1906–12 October 1990) nicknamed \"Shetlands Larsen\", was perhaps the most famous of the Shetland Bus men. In all he made 52 trips to Norway and became the most highly decorated Allied naval officer of the Second World War. Larsen was born in Bergen, Norway and joined the Norwegian volunteers during the Finnish Winter War. Soon after the war in Finland ended, Norway was invaded by Germany. A Swedish officer, Benckert, set up a company of volunteers who made their way to Norway and fought in eastern Norway until 8 June 1940, until the end of war.\n\nLarsen arrived in Shetland with the boat M/B \"Motig I\", on 11 February 1941. After training with \"Kompani Linge\" in England and Scotland, Larsen returned to Lerwick in the \"St Magnus\" on 19 August 1941. He did his first Shetland Bus tour with M/B \"Siglaos\", skippered by Petter Salen, on 14 September 1941. After the loss of the minelayer \"Nordsjøen\", where Larsen was second in command, he became a skipper and could choose his own crew. His first crew was Palmer Bjørnøy, Leif Kinn, Arne Kinn, Kåre Iversen, Karsten Sangolt, Nils Nipen and Otto Pletten. His first boat was M/K \"Arthur\", the boat that he had \"requisitioned\" on his escape from Norway, after the wrecking of \"Nordsjøen\". On 8 November 1941, Larsen sailed from Shetland on his first tour as skipper. On their return to Shetland, they ran into a storm and Sangolt was blown overboard and drowned. Larsen made several tours with the \"Arthur\" but he also skippered other boats, like M/B \"Siglaos\" and M/B \"Feie\". In October 1942, he had to scuttle the \"Arthur\" in Throndheimsfjord after a failed attempt to attack the German warship \"Tirpitz\". He and the crew escaped to Sweden but a British agent, A.B. Evans, was arrested and later shot.\n\nOn 23 March 1943, returning from Træna, Nordland, with M/K \"Bergholm\", they were attacked by German aircraft. The boat was sunk but Larsen and the crew, many of them wounded, rowed for several days until they reached the coast of Norway, near Ålesund but Nils Vika, died of his wounds. The other crew were: Andreas Færøy, Johannes Kalvø, Finn Clausen, Gunnar Clausen, Odd Hansen and William Enoksen. After hiding in different places, they were rescued on 14 April by a Motor Torpedo Boat (MTB) from Lerwick with Lieut. Broberg in command. In October 1943, the new submarine chasers arrived and Larsen became commander of \"Vigra\", with the rank of Sub-Lieutenant. In total he made 52 tours to Norway in fishing vessels and submarine chasers.\n\nBritish awards:\nNorwegian awards:\n\nKåre Emil Iversen, (10 October 1918–22 August 2001), was born in Flatanger, Norway. He was the son of a sea pilot and had joined his father on the pilot boat. When the Germans attacked Norway he was a fisherman and soon joined the underground army. His activities were discovered by the Germans and he had to leave the country. He and three other men escaped to Shetland in August 1941 with his father's boat, the 42-foot \"Villa II\". From Shetland he was transferred to England where he joined and trained with the \"Kompani Linge\". He was among the men Larsen choose as crew on M/B \"Arthur\" and sailed several tours with Larsen. He was crewman on M/B \"Siglaos\", M/B \"Feie\", M/B \"Harald\" and M/B \"Heland\". In December 1943, he joined the crew on the submarine chaser \"Hessa\" as engineer, under command of Petter Salen. When \"Hessa\" was under repair, Iversen served as engineer on \"Vigra\" and did one tour on a Norwegian Navy MTB. When \"Hessa\" was back again he rejoined the crew and stayed there until the war ended. Kåre Iversen did 57 tours across the North Sea, most of them as engineer. On 6 December 1944, he married the Scalloway girl Christine 'Cissie' Slater. They stayed in Scalloway after the war and had three daughters. In 1996, Shetland Times Ltd. published Iversen's memoirs, \"I Was a Shetland Bus Man\", which was reprinted in 2004, with a new introduction and the title \"Shetland Bus Man\".\n\nThe first of the Shetland Bus men to lose his life was Nils Nesse, 23, from Bremnes on the island Bømlo south of Bergen. He was killed on 28 October 1941, when German aircraft attacked the \"Siglaos\" on its way to Shetland from Norway. Nesse was buried at Lunna Kirk churchyard with a Scottish ceremony, because there was no Norwegian clergyman to conduct the funeral. His body was moved to his home in Norway in 1948 and a cross marks his grave at Lunna. Nesse was the second Norwegian buried at Lunna Kirk. The first was an unknown sailor buried on 5 February 1940. He was probably from the cargo ship \"Hop\", that had left Bergen on 2 February 1940 and was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine. The third man was buried 9 June 1942. He was found drifting in the sea by a local crofter, John Johnson from Lunna. The \"Shetland–Norwegian Friendship Society\" has set up a plaque on the churchyard wall in remembrance to these two unknown men. British naval officer, historian and author David Howarth (28 July 1912–2 July 1991) requested that his ashes be scattered over the water at Lunna Voe. A memorial plaque is mounted on the churchyard wall at Lunna Kirk.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was marketed as Thelin by Encysive Pharmaceuticals until Pfizer purchased Encysive in February 2008. In 2010, Pfizer voluntarily removed sitaxentan from the market due to concerns about liver toxicity.\n\nSitaxentan is a small molecule that blocks the action of endothelin (ET) on the endothelin-A (ET) receptor selectively (by a factor of 6000 compared with the ET). It is a sulfonamide class endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and is undergoing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for treating pulmonary hypertension. The rationale for benefit compared with bosentan, a nonselective ET blocker, is negligible inhibition of the beneficial effects of ET stimulation, such as nitric oxide production and clearance of ET from circulation. In clinical trials, the efficacy of sitaxentan has been much the same as bosentan, but the hepatotoxicity of sitaxentan outweighs its benefits. Dosing is once daily, as opposed to twice daily for bosentan.\n\nOn December 10, 2010 Pfizer announced it would be withdrawing sitaxentan worldwide (both from marketing and from all clinical study use), citing that it is a cause of fatal liver damage.\n\nSitaxentan was approved for marketing in the European Union in 2006, in Canada in 2006 and in Australia in 2007. By February 2008 it had been launched commercially in Germany, Austria, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain and Italy.\n\nIn March 2006, the FDA recommended an approvable status to sitaxentan but said it would not yet approve the product. In July 2006, sitaxentan received a second approvable letter stating that efficacy outcome issues raised in the context of the STRIDE-2 study were still unresolved. In July 2007, Encysive commenced a formal dispute resolution process in a preliminary meeting with the FDA. In September 2007 the company announced that it was making preparations for another phase III clinical trial (intended to be named STRIDE-5) to overcome the FDA's concerns. The takeover by Pfizer resulted in a reconfiguration and extension of these plans, to include combination therapy with sildenafil. The Sitaxentan Efficacy and Safety Trial With a Randomized Prospective Assessment of Adding Sildenafil (SR-PAAS) was an ongoing program of three clinical trials conducted in the United States (ClinicalTtrials.gov identifiers: NCT00795639, NCT00796666 and NCT00796510) with anticipated completion dates between June 2010 and January 2014.\n\nAdverse effects observed with sitaxentan are class effects of endothelin receptor antagonists, and include :\n\nBecause sitaxentan inhibits metabolism of warfarin, a decreased dose of warfarin is needed when co-administered with sitaxentan. This is because warfarin acts to prevent blood from clotting, and if it remains unmetabolized, it can continue to thin the blood.\n\n"}

{"id": "11636222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11636222", "title": "Superleague Formula", "text": "Superleague Formula\n\nSuperleague Formula was an open wheel single seater motor racing formula, which started in 2008, at Donington Park in the United Kingdom. The league introduced team sponsorship by association football clubs. It used the slogan 'The Beautiful Race: Football at 300 km/h'. By 2011 the link with football was fading with more than half the teams no longer associated with football teams. It was founded by businessmen Alex Andreu and Robin Webb. On 19 May 2010, Andreu stepped down in his role as series president, with his successor named as Alfredo Brisac not many weeks later. The season ran between April and November at the same time as most other European race series. Every team used identical cars and 750-horsepower V-12 engines. The Sonangol Group was the series' title sponsor from June 2009 until the end of the 2010 season.\n\nThe future of the championship was in doubt after the cancellation of over three-quarters of 2011 season events. In April 2012, when most European motor racing started, there had been no news or information regarding the possibility of a 2012 or 2013 season running. The website updates ceased in 2011, and no further seasons were organised.\n\nContinuing the concept of Premier 1 Grand Prix, the Superleague Formula was announced in 2005, receiving the full approval of the FIA in December 2005. The goal was to have a starting grid of twenty teams, each with one car. Much of the sales, marketing and technology work would be handled centrally by the league, thus affording a considerable cost-savings to the teams.\n\nThe inaugural season, in 2008, was won by Chinese club Beijing Guoan, driven by Italian FIA GT Championship racer, Davide Rigon. The season consisted of six double-headers, featuring 18 clubs, and also brought victories for Liverpool F.C., A.C. Milan, PSV Eindhoven, F.C. Porto, Sevilla FC, Al Ain and Borussia Dortmund. Superleague Formula's debut race was seen in 62 countries, and 100,000 people watched the twelve races, with 34,000 fans attending the last race in Jerez, broadcast live in 70 countries.\n\nIn 2009, the second season was won by English club Liverpool F.C., driven by Spanish racer Adrián Vallés. The season consisted of six double-headers, featuring 19 clubs, and brought first victories for Tottenham Hotspur, FC Basel 1893, Rangers F.C., Olympiacos CFP, Sporting CP, R.S.C. Anderlecht and Galatasaray S.K.. This was the first season to feature the Super Final format, adding a six car shootout to four of the six rounds. The races were broadcast in 62 countries to a reach of 100 million people.\n\n2010 was the third season and saw the biggest change yet, with the calendar increased from six to twelve race weekends and another increase to both race event and end-of-season prize money. An average of 18 clubs competed at each event throughout the season. In a pre-season interview, Superleague Formula's Competition Director Robin Webb said,\nAfter its biggest growth in 2010, 2011 saw a significant contraction with just six football clubs continuing their association into the series fourth season. The remaining cars carried national identities with many more closely associated with the competing drivers rather than any football connection. While an ambitious calendar was announced, several races were cancelled and relocated and as late as September organisers were still seeking to confirm some of its late season races, leaving doubt as to whether the series would have more than half the races of the 2010 season.\n\nAfter the cancellation of the 2011 Chinese rounds, there were no news reports on the 2012 season. With many drivers and teams having joined other series, as well as no updates from the Superleague Formula website, the series was discontinued after just four seasons of racing.\n\nSuperleague Formula’s race format incorporated a Saturday qualification and races on Sunday, one with a reverse grid. For each round, the competing teams competed for prize money, plus points in a yearly championship.\n\n\n\n\nSuperleague Formula employed a unique qualifying system based on a group stage to knock-out format used in some football tournaments:\n\nThe championship was decided by points, which were awarded according to the position in which a driver classifies at the end of each race, of which there were three per race weekend. The points were allocated as follows:\n\nFor the first two seasons the driver did not need to finish the race in order to collect points, but did have to start. However, in 2010 a driver needs to start and finish the race in order to score. The same points are awarded for Race 1 as Race 2, despite Race 2 having a reverse grid with the slowest given the advantage at the front. In 2009 began the running of a third race, a 'Super Final', at the end of certain weekends, however no points were awarded this race. As a result, the maximum number of points any football club/driver could score in one round during 2008 or 2009 was 100, by winning both main races. This feat wasn't achieved although Sébastien Bourdais, Craig Dolby, Robert Doornbos and Max Wissel all scored 90 points in a weekend by finishing either 2nd and 2nd or 1st and 3rd.\n\nIn 2010 however, with the Super Final also counting for points and 6 points going to the winner, the maximum points haul was now 106, achieved by winning all three races during the weekend. The record was 92 points, held by Craig Dolby from the 2010 Silverstone Superleague Formula round.\n\nEach Superleague Formula car represented a football club or national team.\n\nTwenty-three football clubs and ten country-represented cars started at least one race in Superleague Formula, and all are listed in the table below:\n\nAll of the circuits were existing racetracks except for the Beijing International Street Circuit which was constructed for this competition. Most of the rounds were held in Europe, although rounds were held in China. In total, 21 different circuits from 8 countries have hosted a race weekend. The first to do so was Donington Park, where the first races, at its 2008 round, were held. Only Circuit Zolder hosted races in every season of the competition.\n\nIn July 2010, it was announced that the series would race for the first time outside of Europe by having two events in two successive weekends in China on 3 & 10 October that same year. Robin Webb described the venture as \"a significant moment in the championship’s history\".\n\nFans globally were able to view the championship on national TV channels or via live streaming from the Superleague Formula website. Video highlights of every race from every weekend were also available for streaming from their website.\n\nIn June 2009, Robin Webb stated he wanted the formula to eventually increase to 26 cars and a more diverse range of circuits. He expected the formula to attract more big global clubs and was keen to promote the idea that \"Superleague Formula combines the passion of football with the thrill of auto racing\".\n\nThe cars were built by Panoz Auto Development under the Élan Motorsport Technologies banner and officially named the Panoz DP09. They are powered by 750 bhp, 4.2 litre, V12 engines designed by US-owned Menard Competition Technologies. Élan previously manufactured the Panoz DP01 for the Champ Car series, as well as cars for other championships.\n\nThe chassis was built with a two-metre wide track, using under-body aerodynamics to create the needed conditions for increased overtaking opportunities. The cars were subjected to the lengthy FIA safety tests during development stages in 2007.\n\n\n\n\nAt Magny-Cours in 2009, the best qualifying time for a Superleague Formula car was 1:26.391, almost 11.5 seconds slower than the fastest qualifying time for an F1 car in 2008 of 1:15.024. Both Superleague Formula and Formula One raced at Monza in 2009 where similar dry qualifying conditions meant a better time comparison was possible. The fastest F1 time at the 2009 Italian Grand Prix was a 1:22.955, whereas at the 2009 Monza Superleague Formula round, a month later, the fastest SF time was 1:36.444, 13.5 seconds slower. This makes the speed of Superleague Formula car comparable to the World Series by Renault cars.\n\nOn 14 January 2010, Menard Competition Technologies received a Motorsport Industry Association’s award for Technology and Innovation for its \"outstanding design and engineering work undertaken on the Superleague V12 racing engine\".\n\nA video game for Superleague Formula was made by Media Game and Image Space Incorporated and released for PC on 31 October 2009, although it was originally announced to be released in September. The game, released for download by the series' official website, featured 18 clubs and 6 circuits from in the 2009 season. During the 2009 Donington round some star drivers tested out the new game and gave it positive feedback.\n\n\n"}

The 2007 Roots N Blues N BBQ Festival was organized by advertising agency Woodruff Sweitzer with the help of Richard King, then-owner of The Blue Note. The City of Columbia shut down ten city blocks in downtown Columbia for the festival, which drew a crowd of around 70,000.\n\nIn 2007, the Blues in the Schools program was formed by King and local musician and educator TJ Wheeler. The program brings music and cultural education to elementary, middle school and high school students across mid-Missouri.

Woodruff Sweitzer and King continued ownership of the festival and Thumper Entertainment. \n\nIn 2013, the festival was moved to Stephens Lake Park. After the change of location, the festival saw a decline in attendance, from 52,000 in the year prior to just over 23,000. The drop in attendance was likely due to an elimination of free attendance areas.\n\nIn 2014, the addition of a green vendor program marked a move toward sustainability. A set of guidelines for food and craft vendors, which includes replacing styrofoam and plastic plates and utensils with biodegradable alternatives, recycling fry oil and composting food scraps, intends to help minimize the festival's ecological footprint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Grey submitted the manuscript of \"Tonto Basin\" to the magazine \"The Country Gentleman,\" which published it in serialization as \"To the Last Man\" from May 28, 1921 through July 30, 1921. This was a much shorter version of the original leaving out much of the backstory and character development. This shorter version was published as a book by Harper Brothers in 1921.\n\nA story of a feud between two families, the evil it causes, and the power of love to transcend all.\n\nThe story begins with 24-year-old Jean Isbel in the last stages of a multi-week trip from Oregon to the frontier in Arizona where his family had moved four years earlier to start a cattle ranch. As he nears his destination he meets a woman in the woods, and falls in love at first sight. As they part they learn that they are mortal enemies. She is Ellen Jorth, and her family is locked in a deadly feud with his.\n\nJean dreads the part his father, Gaston, wants him to play in the feud. He can’t get Ellen out of his mind. They meet again and his words awake in her doubt and fear that her father, Lee Jorth, is not an honorable man but in fact a horse thief and cattle rustler. As events unfold her fears are proved true. Through thick and thin Jean Isbel defends Ellen’s honor and believes the best of her.\n\nThe feud erupts into fatal gun battles, first at the Isbel ranch house, and then at the general store in the nearby town. Most of the Isbel and Jorth clans are killed, with several of their allies. The remnant of the Jorths flee with Ellen in tow to a hide-out hidden in a deep box cañon.\n\nJean and his allies track them and there is a deadly gun battle in the woods nearby. Ellen is forced by one of the three remaining Jorth allies to flee once again. During their flight their horse is shot out from under them. Ellen now on foot meets one of the dying Isbels and finally learns the certain truth that her father, family, and their allies were horse thieves and cattle rustlers as she feared.\n\nWhen she finally makes her way back to the hide-out, she arrives just after Jean has been forced to take refuge in the loft, unknown to her. One of the two remaining rustlers attacks her with rape in mind but is interrupted by the arrival of the other rustler. Ellen discovers Jean during this interruption. When the rustler returns a few minutes later, Ellen is forced to kill him to protect herself and Jean. A minute later Jean kills the last rustler.\n\nThe story ends with Jean and Ellen declaring their love for each other.\n\nThe book is concerned with the destruction deadly violence wreaks on those family members who survive. Grey writes about the intense concern Jean feels for the impact the violence will have on the wives and children whose husbands and fathers will die in the feud.\n\nThe feud is caused by a love triangle between Gaston Isbel, Lee Jorth, and Ellen the woman both love, and the mother of Ellen Jorth. The story explores how love, betrayal, and jealousy can engender a hate which leads two men to destroy their families, without a thought to the pain and suffering of those relatives who will be left to bury the dead.\n\nEllen grows from a naïve girl to a woman of understanding under the severe trial of the events which overtake her. She begins to examine critically her own behavior with wisdom and insight. She grows and matures emotionally and psychologically, becoming aware that her father whom she had supported with unquestioning trust, is in fact a scoundrel, a thief, and a thoroughly dishonorable rogue. At the end she acts decisively and fatally to protect herself, her virtue, and the man she loves.\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Jon Tuska, was researching the filmography of Zane Grey. During this research he discovered that \"Last of the Duanes\" and \"Rangers of the Lone Star\" were much altered from the holograph found \"in the bottom drawer of a file cabinet in the Zane Grey, Inc. room where it had survived for eighty years.\". This caused him to request that they \"tell me of any other manuscripts...that had met a similar fate.\" The result was the discovery of the complete holographic manuscript of the novel \"To the Last Man\". A comparison of the holograph with \"To the Last Man\" revealed that the holograph was much longer, and contained detail which altered the meaning of the story. The complete uncut version was published in 2004.\n\n"}
{"id": "4082874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4082874", "title": "Workplace bullying", "text": "Workplace bullying\n\nWorkplace bullying is a persistent pattern of mistreatment from others in the workplace that causes either physical or emotional harm. It can include such tactics as verbal, nonverbal, psychological, physical abuse and humiliation. This type of workplace aggression is particularly difficult because, unlike the typical school bully, workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organization and their society. In the majority of cases, bullying in the workplace is reported as having been by someone who has authority over their victim. However, bullies can also be peers, and occasionally subordinates. Research has also investigated the impact of the larger organizational context on bullying as well as the group-level processes that impact on the incidence and maintenance of bullying behaviour. Bullying can be covert or overt. It may be missed by superiors; it may be known by many throughout the organization. Negative effects are not limited to the targeted individuals, and may lead to a decline in employee morale and a change in organizational culture. It can also take place as overbearing supervision, constant criticism, and they may work at hospice\n\nThe first known documented use of \"workplace bullying\" is in 1992 in a book by Andrea Adams called \"Bullying at Work: How to Confront and Overcome It\".\n\nWhile there is no universally accepted formal definition of workplace bullying, several researchers have endeavoured to define it:\n\nBecause it can occur in a variety of contexts and forms, it is also useful to define workplace bullying by the key features that these behaviours possess. Bullying is characterized by:\n\nThis distinguishes bullying from isolated behaviours and other forms of job stress and allows the term workplace bullying to be applied in various contexts and to behaviours that meet these characteristics. Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour. However, some experts who have dealt with a great many people who report abuse also categorize some once-only events as bullying, for example with cases where there appear to be severe sequelae. Expanding the common understanding of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of sexual harassment in the US.\n\nAccording to Pamela Lutgin-Sandvik, the lack of unifying language to name the phenomenon of workplace bullying is a problem because without a unifying term or phrase, individuals have difficulty naming their experiences of abuse, and therefore have trouble pursuing justice against the bully. Unlike sexual harassment, which named a specific problem and is now recognized in law of many countries (including U.S.), workplace bullying is still being established as a relevant social problem and is in need of a specific vernacular.\n\nEuphemisms intended to trivialize bullying and its impact on bullied people include: incivility, disrespect, difficult people, personality conflict, negative conduct, and ill treatment. Bullied people are labelled as insubordinate when they resist the bullying treatment.\n\nThere is no exact definition for bullying behaviours in workplace, which is why different terms and definitions are common. For example, mobbing is a commonly used term in France and Germany, where it refers to a \"mob\" of bullies, rather than a single bully; this phenomenon is not often seen in other countries. In the United States, aggression and emotional abuse are frequently used terms, whereas harassment is the term preferred in Finland. Workplace bullying is primarily used in Australia, UK, and Northern Europe.\n\nBosses are the most common bullies. In fact, approximately 72% of bullies outrank their victims. Statistics from the 2007 WBI-Zogby survey show that 13% of U.S. employees report being bullied currently, 24% say they have been bullied in the past and an additional 12% say they have witnessed workplace bullying. Nearly half of all American workers (49%) report that they have been affected by workplace bullying, either being a target themselves or having witnessed abusive behaviour against a co-worker.\n\nAlthough socioeconomic factors may play a role in the abuse, researchers from the Project for Wellness and Work-Life suggest that \"workplace bullying, by definition, is not explicitly connected to demographic markers such as sex and ethnicity\". Because one in ten employees experiences workplace bullying, the prevalence of this issue is cause for great concern, even as initial data about this issue are reviewed.\n\nAccording to the 2010 National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement (NHIS-OHS), the national prevalence rate for workers reporting having been threatened, bullied, or harassed by anyone on the job was 8%.\n\nIn 2008, Dr. Judy Fisher-Blando wrote a doctoral research dissertation on \"Aggressive behaviour: Workplace Bullying and Its Effect on Job Satisfaction and Productivity\". The scientific study determined that almost 75% of employees surveyed had been affected by workplace bullying, whether as a target or a witness. Further research showed the types of bullying behaviour, and organizational support.\n\nIn terms of gender, the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007) states that women appear to be at greater risk of becoming a bullying target, as 57% of those who reported being targeted for abuse were women. Men are more likely to participate in aggressive bullying behaviour (60%), however when the bully is a woman her target is more likely to be a woman as well (71%).\n\nIn the research of Samnani and Singh (2012), it concludes the findings from previous 20 years' literature and claims that in terms of the gender factor, inconsistent findings could not support the differences across gender.\n\nIn a study done by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the NHIS-OHS confirms the previous finding, as higher prevalence rates for being threatened, bullied, or harassed were identified for women (9%) compared with men (7%).\n\nRace also may play a role in the experience of workplace bullying. According to the Workplace Bullying Institute (2007), the comparison of reported combined bullying (current + ever bullied) prevalence percentages reveals the pattern from most to least:\n\nThe reported rates of witnessing bullying were:\n\nThe percentages of those reporting that they have neither experienced nor witnessed mistreatment were:\n\nResearch psychologist Tony Buon published one of the first reviews of bullying in China in the prestigious Journal PKU Business Review in 2005.\n\nHigher prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for divorced or separated workers compared to married workers, widowed workers, and never married workers.\n\nHigher prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers with some college education or workers with high school diploma or GED, compared to workers with less than a high school education.\n\nLower prevalence rates for experiencing a hostile work environment were identified for workers aged 65 and older compared to workers in other age groups.\n\nWith respect to age, conflicting findings have been reported. A study by Einarsen and Skogstad (1996) indicates older employees tend to be more likely to be bullied than younger ones.\n\nAmong industry groups, workers with higher prevalence rates of a hostile work environment, compared to all adults employed at some time in a 12-month period leading up to a survey in 2010 (8%), were in public administration (16%) and retail trade industries (10%). Lower prevalence rates of a hostile work environment were reported among those working in construction (5%); finance and insurance (5%); manufacturing (5%); and professional, scientific, and technical services industries (6%).\n\nFor occupational groups, workers in protective service reported a higher prevalence rate (25%) of hostile work environments compared to the prevalence rate for all adults employed at some time in the past 12 months. Workers in community and social service occupations also experienced a relatively high rate (16%). Lower prevalence rates were observed among architecture and engineering (4%), computer and mathematical (4%), business and financial operations (5%), and construction and extraction (5%) occupations.\n\nResearchers Caitlin Buon and Tony Buon have suggested that attempts to profile ‘the bully’ have been damaging They state that the \"bully\" profile is that ‘the bully’ is always aware of what they are doing, deliberately sets out to harm their ‘victims’, targets a particular individual or type of person and has some kind of underlying personality flaw, insecurity or disorder. But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. Tony Buon and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve behaviour change over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions and emotional competencies and cannot be transformed if externalization and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal interactions.\n\nBased on research by H. Hoel and C.L. Cooper, most the perpetrators are supervisors. The second most common group is peers, followed by subordinates and customers. The three main relationships among the participants in workplace bullying: \n\nBullying may also occur between an organization and its employees.\n\nBullying behaviour by supervisors toward subordinates typically manifests as an abuse of power by the supervisor in the workplace. Bullying behaviours by supervisors may be associated with a culture of bullying and the management style of the supervisors. An authoritative management style, specifically, often includes bullying behaviours, which can make subordinates fearful and allow supervisors to bolster their authority over others.\n\nOn the other hand, some researchers suggest that bullying behaviours can be a positive force for performance in the workplace. Workplace bullying may contribute to organizational power and control.\n\nHowever, if an organization wishes to discourage bullying in the workplace, strategies and policies must be put into place to dissuade and counter bullying behavior. Lack of monitoring or of punishment/corrective action will result in an organizational culture that supports/tolerates bullying.\n\nIn addition to supervisor – subordinate bullying, bullying behaviours also occur between colleagues. Peers can be either the target or perpetrator. If workplace bullying happens among the co-workers, witnesses will typically choose sides, either with the target or the perpetrator. Perpetrators usually \"win\" since witnesses do not want to be the next target. This outcome encourages perpetrators to continue their bullying behaviour. In addition, the sense of the injustice experienced by a target might lead that person to become another perpetrator who bullies other colleagues who have less power than they do, thereby proliferating bullying in the organization.\n\nMaarit Varitia, a workplace bullying researcher, found that 20% of interviewees who experienced workplace bullying attributed their being targeted to their differences from others.\n\nThe third relationship in the workplace is between employees and customers. Although less frequent, such cases play a significant role in the efficiency of the organization. Overly stressed or distressed employees may be less able to perform optimally and can impact the quality of service overall.\n\nThe fourth relationship in the workplace is between the organization or system and its employees. An article by Andreas Liefooghe (2012) notes that many employees describe their employer as a \"bully.\"\n\nThese cases, the issue is not simply an organizational culture or environmental factors facilitating bullying, but bullying-like behaviour by an employer against an employee. Tremendous power imbalances between an organization and its employees enables the employer to \"legitimately exercise\" power (e.g., by monitoring and controlling employees) in a manner consistent with bullying.\n\nAlthough the terminology of bullying traditionally implies an interpersonal relationship between the perpetrator and target, organizations' or other collectives' actions can constitute bullying both by definition and in their impacts on targets. However, while defining bullying as an interpersonal phenomenon is considered legitimate, classifying incidences of employer exploitation, retaliation, or other abuses of power against an employee as a form of bullying is often not taken as seriously.\n\nBullying is seen to be prevalent in organizations where employees and managers feel that\nthey have the support, or at least the implicit blessing of senior managers to carry on their abusive\nand bullying behaviour. Furthermore, new managers will quickly come to view this form of behaviour as\nacceptable and normal if they see others get away with it and are even rewarded for it.\n\nWhen bullying happens at the highest levels, the effects may be far reaching. People may be bullied irrespective of their organizational status or rank, including senior managers, which indicates the possibility of a negative domino effect, where bullying may cascade downwards, as the targeted supervisors might offload their own aggression onto their subordinates. In such situations, a bullying scenario in the boardroom may actually threaten the productivity of the entire organisation.\n\nResearch investigating the acceptability of the bullying behaviour across different cultures (e.g.g Power et al., 2013) clearly shows that culture matters here. One's culture affects the perception of the acceptable behaviour. \nOne's national background also influences the prevalence of workplace bullying (Harvey et al., 2009; Hoel et al., 1999; Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).\n\nHumane orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying for WRB (Work related bullying).\nPerformance orientation is positively associated with the acceptance of bullying. Future orientation is negatively associated with the acceptability of bullying. A culture of femininity suggests that individuals who live and work in this kind of culture tend to value interpersonal relationships to a greater degree.\n\nThree broad dimensions have been mentioned in relation to workplace bullying: power distance; masculinity versus femininity; and individualism versus collectivism (Lutgen-Sandvik et al., 2007).\n\nIn Confucian Asia, which has a higher performance orientation than Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, bullying may be seen as an acceptable price to pay for performance. The value Latin America holds for personal connections with employees and the higher humane orientation of Sub-Saharan Africa may help to explain their distaste for bullying. A culture of individualism in the US implies competition, which may increase the likelihood of workplace bullying situations.\n\nAshforth discussed potentially destructive sides of leadership and identified what he referred to as petty tyrants, i.e., leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace. Partial or intermittent negative reinforcement can create an effective climate of fear and doubt. When employees get the sense that bullies \"get away with it,\" a climate of fear may be the result. Several studies have confirmed a relationship between bullying, on the one hand, and an autocratic leadership and an authoritarian way of settling conflicts or dealing with disagreements, on the other. An authoritarian style of leadership may create a climate of fear, where there is little or no room for dialogue and where complaining may be considered futile.\n\nIn a study of public-sector union members, approximately one in five workers reported having considered leaving the workplace as a result of witnessing bullying taking place. Rayner explained these figures by pointing to the presence of a climate of fear in which employees considered reporting to be unsafe, where bullies had \"got away with it\" previously despite management knowing of the presence of bullying.\n\nThe workplace bully is often expert at knowing how to work the system. They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their abusive behaviour hidden, any charges made by individuals about his or her bullying will always come down to your word against his. They may have a \"kiss up kick down\" personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite when it comes to their relationship with those whom they supervise. Bullies tend to ingratiate themselves to their bosses while intimidating subordinates. They may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine\ntheir fate. Often, a workplace bully will have mastered \"kiss up kick down\" tactics that hide their abusive side from superiors who review their performance.\n\nAs a consequence of this \"kiss up kick down\" strategy: \n\nThe most typical reactions to workplace bullying are to do with the survival instinct – \"fight or flight\" – and\nthese are probably a victim's healthier responses to bullying. Flight is a legitimate and valid response to bullying. It is very common, especially in organizations in which upper management cannot or will not deal with the bullying. In hard economic times, however, flight may not be an option, and fighting may be the only choice.\n\nFighting the bullying can require near heroic action, especially if the bullying targets just one or two individuals. It can also be a difficult challenge. There are some times when confrontation is called for. First, there is always a chance that the bully boss is labouring under the impression that this is the way to get things done and does not recognize the havoc being wrought on subordinates.\n\nWith some variations, the following typology of workplace bullying behaviours has been adopted by a number of academic researchers. The typology uses five different categories.\n\n\nResearch by the Workplace Bullying Institute, suggests that the following are the 25 most common workplace bullying tactics:\n\nAccording to Bassman, common abusive workplace behaviours are:\n\nAccording to Hoel and Cooper, common abusive workplace behaviours are:\nAbusive cyberbullying in the workplace can have serious socioeconomic and psychological consequences on the victim. Workplace cyberbullying can lead to sick leave due to depression which in turn can lead to loss of profits for the organisation.\n\nSeveral aspects of academia, such as the generally decentralized nature of academic institutions and the particular recruitment and career procedures, lend themselves to the practice of bullying and discourage its reporting and mitigation.\n\nBullying has been identified as prominent in blue collar jobs including on the oil rigs, and in mechanical areas and machine shops, warehouses and factories. It is thought that intimidation and fear of retribution cause decreased incident reports, which, in the socioeconomic and cultural milieu of such industries, would likely lead to a vicious circle. This is often used in combination with manipulation and coercion of facts to gain favour among higher ranking administrators.\n\nA culture of bullying is common in information technology (IT), leading to high sickness rates, low morale, poor productivity and high staff turnover. Deadline-driven project work and stressed-out managers take their toll on IT workers.\n\nBullying in the medical profession is common, particularly of student or trainee doctors. It is thought that this is at least in part an outcome of conservative traditional hierarchical structures and teaching methods in the medical profession which may result in a bullying cycle.\n\nBullying has been identified as being particularly prevalent in the nursing profession although the reasons are not clear. It is thought that relational aggression (psychological aspects of bullying such as gossiping and intimidation) are relevant. Relational aggression has been studied amongst girls but not so much amongst adult women.\n\nSchool teachers are commonly the subject of bullying but they are also sometimes the originators of bullying within a school environment.\n\nBullying in the legal profession is believed to be more common than in some other professions. It is believed that its adversarial, hierarchical tradition contributes towards this. Women, trainees and solicitors who have been qualified for five years or less are more impacted, as are ethnic minority lawyers and lesbian, gay and bisexual lawyers.\n\nBullying exists to varying degrees in the military of some countries, often involving various forms of hazing or abuse by higher members of the military hierarchy.\n\nBullying can be common in volunteering settings. For example, one study found bullying to be the most significant factor of complaints amongst volunteers \n. Volunteers often do not have access to protections available to paid employees, so while laws may indicate that bullying is a violation of rights, volunteers may have no means to address it.\n\nTim Field suggested that workplace bullying takes these forms:\n\nAdult bullying can come in an assortment of forms. There are about five distinctive types of adult bullies. A narcissistic bully is described as a self-centred person whose egotism is frail and possesses the need to put others down. An impulsive bully is someone who acts on bullying based on stress or being upset at the moment. A physical bully uses physical injury and the threat of harm to abuse their victims, while a verbal bully uses demeaning and cynicism to debase their victims. Lastly, a secondary adult bully is portrayed as a person that did not start the initial bullying but participates in afterwards to avoid being bullied themselves (\"Adult Bullying\"). \n\nWorkplace bullying is reported to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to have a significant impact on ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and self-management dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.\n\nAbusive supervision overlaps with workplace bullying in the workplace context. Research suggests that 75% of workplace bullying incidents are perpetrated by hierarchically superior agents. Abusive supervision differs from related constructs such as supervisor bullying and undermining in that it does not describe the intentions or objectives of the supervisor.\n\nA power and control model has been developed for the workplace, divided into the following categories:\n\nWorkplace mobbing overlaps with workplace bullying. The concept originated from the study of animal behaviour. It concentrates on bullying by a group.\n\nWorkplace bullying overlaps to some degree with workplace incivility but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing incivility between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of incivility are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.\n\nIn 2005, psychologists Belinda Board and Katarina Fritzon at the University of Surrey, UK, interviewed and gave personality tests to high-level British executives and compared their profiles with those of criminal psychiatric patients at Broadmoor Hospital in the UK. They found that three out of eleven personality disorders were actually more common in executives than in the disturbed criminals. They were:\n\nThey described these business people as successful psychopaths and the criminals as unsuccessful psychopaths.\n\nAccording to leading leadership academic Manfred F.R. Kets de Vries, it seems almost inevitable these days that there will be some personality disorders in a senior management team.\n\nIndustrial/organizational psychology research has also examined the types of bullying that exist among business professionals and the prevalence of this form of bullying in the workplace as well as ways to measure bullying empirically.\n\nNarcissism, lack of self-regulation, lack of remorse and lack of conscience have been identified as traits displayed by bullies. These traits are shared with psychopaths, indicating that there is some theoretical\ncross-over between bullies and psychopaths. Bullying is used by corporate psychopaths as a tactic to humiliate subordinates. Bullying is also used as a tactic to scare, confuse and disorient those who may be a threat to the activities of the corporate psychopath Using meta data analysis on hundreds of UK research papers, Boddy concluded that 36% of bullying incidents were caused by the presence of corporate psychopaths. According to Boddy there are two types of bullying:\n\nA corporate psychopath uses instrumental bullying to further their goals of promotion and power as the result of causing confusion and divide and rule.\n\nPeople with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale are more likely to engage in bullying, crime and drug use than other people. Hare and Babiak noted that about 29% of corporate psychopaths are also bullies. Other research has also shown that people with high scores on a psychopathy rating scale were more likely to engage in bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.\n\nA workplace bully or abuser will often have issues with social functioning. These types of people often have psychopathic traits that are difficult to identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals often lack anger management skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.\n\nIn 2007, researchers Catherine Mattice and Brian Spitzberg at San Diego State University, USA, found that narcissism revealed a positive relationship with bullying. Narcissists were found to prefer indirect bullying tactics (such as withholding information that affects others' performance, ignoring others, spreading gossip, constantly reminding others of mistakes, ordering others to do work below their competence level, and excessively monitoring others' work) rather than direct tactics (such as making threats, shouting, persistently criticizing, or making false allegations). The research also revealed that narcissists are highly motivated to bully, and that to some extent, they are left with feelings of satisfaction after a bullying incident occurs.\n\nAccording to Namie, Machiavellians manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas but he emphasizes that they are not mentally ill. They do not have a personality disorder, schizophrenia and neither are they psychopaths. In his view, Machiavellianism represents the core of workplace bullying.\n\nAccording to Gary and Ruth Namie, as well as Tracy, et al., workplace bullying can harm the health of the targets of bullying. Organizations are beginning to take note of workplace bullying because of the costs to the organization in terms of the health of their employees.\n\nAccording to scholars at The Project for Wellness and Work-Life at Arizona State University, \"workplace bullying is linked to a host of physical, psychological, organizational, and social costs.\" Stress is the most predominant health effect associated with bullying in the workplace. Research indicates that workplace stress has significant negative effects that are correlated to poor mental health and poor physical health, resulting in an increase in the use of \"sick days\" or time off from work (Farrell & Geist-Martin, 2005).\n\nThe negative effects of bullying are so severe that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and even suicide are not uncommon. Tehrani found that one in 10 targets experience PTSD, and that 44% of her respondents experienced PTSD similar to that of battered women and victims of child abuse. Matthiesen and Einarsen found that up to 77% of targets experience PTSD.\n\nIn addition, co-workers who witness workplace bullying can also have negative effects, such as fear, stress, and emotional exhaustion. Those who witness repetitive workplace abuse often choose to leave the place of employment where the abuse took place. Workplace bullying can also hinder the organizational dynamics such as group cohesion, peer communication, and overall performance.\n\nAccording to the 2012 survey conducted by Workplace Bullying Institute (516 respondents), Anticipation of next negative event is the most common psychological symptom of workplace bullying reported by 80%. Panic attacks afflict 52%. Half (49%) of targets reported being diagnosed with clinical depression. Sleep disruption, loss of concentration, mood swings, and pervasive sadness and insomnia were more common (ranging from 77% to 50%). Nearly three-quarters (71%) of targets sought treatment from a physician. Over half (63%) saw a mental health professional for their work-related symptoms. Respondents reported other symptoms that can be exacerbated by stress: migraine headaches (48%), irritable bowel disorder (37%), chronic fatigue syndrome (33%) and sexual dysfunction (27%).\n\nSeveral studies have attempted to quantify the cost of bullying to an organization.\n\nResearch by Dr. Dan Dana has shown organizations suffer a large financial cost by not accurately managing conflict and bullying type behaviours. He has developed a tool to assist with calculating the cost of conflict. In addition, researcher Tamara Parris discusses how employers need to be more attentive in managing various discordant behaviours in the workplace, such as, bullying, as it not only creates a financial cost to the organization, but also erodes the company's human resources assets.\n\nWorkplace bullying is known in some Asian countries as:\n\n\n\nWorkplace depression can occur in many companies of various size and profession, and can have negative effects on positive profit growth (McTernan, Dollard & LaMontagne, 2013). Stress factors that are unique to one's working environment, such as bullying from co-workers or superiors and poor social support for high pressure occupations, can build over time and create an inefficient work behavior in a depressed individual (Evan-Lack & Knapp, 2014). In addition, inadequate or negative communication techniques can further drive an employee towards feeling of being disconnected from the company's mission and goals (Hidzir, et al., 2017). One way that companies can combat the destructive consequences associated with employee depression is to offer more support for counseling and consider bringing in experts to educate staff on the consequences of bullying. Ignoring the problem of depression and decreased workplace performance is creating an unsustainable path towards intergroup conflict and lasting feelings of disillusionment (Fischer, et al., 2014). \nReferences:\nEvans-Lacko, S., & Knapp, M.
