It led to the deposition of Prime Minister Louis Lansana Beavogui, who held the office since 1972, and assumed interim presidential powers on 26 March, when the long-time President Ahmed Sékou Touré died during an emergency heart operation at the Cleveland Clinic in the United States.\n\nColonel Conté announced the dissolution of the ruling Democratic Party of Guinea (PDG), the National Assembly and all mass organizations, suspension of the Constitution, creation of the Military Committee of National Restoration (CMNR) as the ruling junta, and ordered release of political prisoners held at Camp Boiro concentration camp. Conté was named new President on 5 April.\n\nEventually, a power struggle developed between Conté and a fellow member of the CMNR, Diarra Traoré (who briefly served as Prime Minister in April–December 1984), with the latter being executed in the aftermath of a failed coup attempt in July 1985. Conté took advantage of the coup attempt to execute several of Ahmed Sekou Touré's close associates, including his half-brother Ismaël Touré (former chief prosecutor at Camp Boiro), Mamadi Keïta, Siaka Touré (former commander of Camp Boiro), Moussa Diakité, and Abdoulaye Touré (former Minister of Foreign Affairs).\n\nConté remained in power until his death on 22 December 2008, which was almost immediately followed by another coup d'état, led by Captain Moussa Dadis Camara.\n\n"}

{"id": "698219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=698219", "title": "Alan Bond", "text": "Alan Bond\n\nAlan Bond (22 April 1938 – 5 June 2015) was an Australian businessman noted for his high-profile business dealings, including his central role in the WA Inc scandals of the 1980s, and what was at the time the biggest corporate collapse in Australian history; for his bankrolling the successful challenge for the 1983 America's Cup, the first time the New York Yacht Club had ever lost it in its 132-year history; and also for a criminal conviction that saw him serve four years in prison. The prestigious Alan Cup road hockey tournament is held at Bond University in his name.\n\nBorn in London and raised in Australia from the age of 12, Bond began his career as a signwriter and formed what became the Bond Corporation in 1959. He became a public hero in his adopted country after bankrolling challenges for the America's Cup, which resulted in his selection in 1978 as Australian of the Year (awarded jointly with Galarrwuy Yunupingu). His \"Australia II\" syndicate won the 1983 America's Cup, which had been held by the New York Yacht Club since 1851, thus breaking the longest winning streak in the history of sport.\n\nIn 1992, Bond was declared bankrupt with personal debts totalling A$1.8 billion. He was subsequently convicted of fraud and imprisoned after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in Bell Resources to deceptively siphon off A$1.2 billion into the coffers of Bond Corporation. The funds were used to shore up the cash resources of the ailing Bond Corporation, which spectacularly collapsed, leaving Bell Resources in a precarious situation.\n\nFollowing release, he became active in various mining investments, predominately in Africa, including Madagascar Oil PLC and Global Diamond Resources, of Lesotho and was included in \"Business Review Weekly\"'s \"Rich 200 List\" in 2008.\n\nOn 24 and 25 April 2017, the Nine Network aired a heavily fictionalised TV mini-series, House of Bond, based on Bond's rise and fall.\n\nAlan Bond was born on 22 April 1938, the son of Frank and Kathleen Bond in the Hammersmith district of London, England. In 1950, aged 12, he emigrated to Australia with his parents and his older sister Geraldine, living in Fremantle, near Perth. At age 14, he was charged with stealing and being unlawfully on premises. At age 18, he was arrested for being unlawfully on premises and reportedly admitted planning a robbery.\n\nThe Perth-based Bond made his fortune initially in property development and at one time was one of Australia's most prominent businesspeople. In 1970 he bought three America's Cup challenge yachts from Sir Frank Packer. He later extended his business interests into other fields including brewing (he controlled Castlemaine Tooheys in Australia, leading the business to legal success in the landmark constitutional law case of \"Castlemaine Tooheys Ltd v South Australia\", and G. Heileman Brewing Company in La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA), gold mining, television, and airships. In 1987, Australia's first private university, Bond University was founded by Bond Corporation. He purchased QTQ-9 Brisbane and settled an outstanding defamation dispute the station had with the Queensland premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen by paying out A$400,000. He said in a television interview several years later that he paid because \"Sir Joh left no doubt that if we were going to continue to do business successfully in Queensland then he expected the matter to be resolved\".\n\nIn 1987, Bond purchased Vincent van Gogh's renowned painting, \"Irises,\" for $54 million—the highest price ever paid for a single painting. However, the purchase was funded by a substantial loan from the auctioneer, Sotheby's, which Bond failed to repay. The transaction was criticised by art dealers as possibly a manipulated sale designed to artificially inflate values generally (which it seems to have done). The painting was subsequently re-sold in 1990 to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.\n\nAlso in 1987, he built and developed the Bond Centre in Hong Kong. It was later bought by the Lippo Group of Indonesia and is now known as the Lippo Centre.\n\nIn 1987, Bond paid $1 billion for the Australia-wide Channel Nine television network from Kerry Packer's PBL. In a 2003 interview with Andrew Denton, Bond described the negotiations as follows:\n\n\"...when we first sat down, we said, 'We're either going to sell our stations to you for $400 million, or you're going to sell your stations to us.' And [Kerry Packer] said, 'Well, I don't really want to sell my stations.' And I said, 'Oh, is that right?' So, anyway, after much discussion, Kerry thumped the table and said, 'Listen, if you can pay me $1 billion, I'll sell them to you, otherwise bugger off'. ... [T]hen I rang the National Australia Bank. I said, 'Look, I'm in discussions here to buy these television stations. Kerry will sell to me, and what I want to do is put our stations together and then, with Sky Channel, I'm going to float it off as a separate entity and raise the capital to pay for it... [Packer] said $1 billion [was his asking price], but I think I'll get it for $800 million.' ... [The bank manager] duly rang back and said yes. I said, 'Thank God. I'll go and have some further negotiations with Kerry,' which I did. And true to his word, he never budged one penny off it. So I settled the deal with $800 million and a $200 million note. So he put his own $200 million in. So I had $1 billion. And we put our other two stations up as collateral, which were worth probably $400 million.\"\n\nIn fact, the agreed price was $1.05 billion. Packer took $800 million in cash and $250 million in subordinated debt in Bond Media.\nOnce Bond went bankrupt, Packer was able to turn the debt into a 37% equity in Bond Media, which now included Channel 9 in Brisbane, and was worth about $500 million. It was valued at $1 billion, but had $500 million in debt on the books.\nStill, Packer was quoted as saying \"You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime, and I've had mine\".\n\nIn 1992, Bond was declared bankrupt after failing to repay a $194 million personal guarantee on a loan for a nickel mining project. His debts reportedly totalled $1.8 billion at the time. In 1995, his family bought him out of bankruptcy, with creditors accepting a payment of A$12 million, a little over half a cent per dollar. In 1997, Bond was sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to using his controlling interest in Bell Resources to deceptively siphon off A$1.2 billion into the coffers of Bond Corporation. The funds were used to shore up the cash resources of the ailing Bond Corporation, which spectacularly collapsed, leaving Bell Resources in a precarious situation.\n\nAt this time, Bond was stripped of his 1984 honour as an Officer of the Order of Australia. He was released from Karnet Prison Farm in 2000, having served four years in various West Australian prisons.\n\nIn 2003, Bond was inducted into the America's Cup Hall of Fame. Since 2003, Bond had worked closely with his son Craig and longtime business partner Robert Quinn through Strategic Investments Ltd.\n\nInterests related to the Bond family also control Global Diamond Resources plc (formerly Lesotho Diamond Corporation) which is developing the Kao diamond pipe in the Kingdom of Lesotho. In 2007, the Federal Court rejected an attempt by Bond to sue freelance journalist Paul Barry over an article Barry wrote about his dealings in Africa with the Lesotho Diamond Company. Bond had claimed that the article had several false statements. In 2008 Bond appealed but this, too, was rejected by the same court which found Mr Bond's claims had no reasonable prospects of success.\n\nBond was involved in a long-running defamation case against \"The West Australian\" newspaper and journalists Mark Drummond and Sean Cowan over a series of articles published in December 2005, in which it was alleged that Bond's friend and business partner Robert Leslie Nelson was moving to hide Bond's involvement in Lesotho Diamond Corporation, Madagascar Oil and a gold company. During that case, Bond tried to have the journalists convicted of contempt of court after some electronic documents disappeared.\n\nIn 2008, Bond made a return to the \"Business Review Weekly\"s \"Rich 200 List\", in 157th spot, with an estimated wealth of $265 million—thanks primarily to his stakes in Madagascar Oil and Global Diamond Resources. \n\nIn 1955, Bond married Eileen Hughes, a member of a prominent Catholic family in Fremantle—her cousin is car dealer John Hughes. She and Bond were both 17 and she was pregnant at the time. Bond, who had been raised Protestant, converted to Catholicism for the marriage. The couple had four children: John, Craig, Susanne and Jody. Bond and Eileen divorced in 1992. Susanne, an equestrian showjumper who had been a member of the Australian showjumping team for seven years, died in 2000 from a suspected accidental overdose of prescription medication.\n\nIn 1995, Bond married Diana Bliss, a public relations consultant and theatre producer. On 28 January 2012, Bliss was found dead in the couple's swimming pool. Police said the circumstances of her death were not suspicious and concluded that Bliss, a longtime sufferer of depression, had committed suicide.\n\nOn 2 June 2015, Bond underwent open-heart surgery at a private hospital in Perth to replace and repair his heart valves. Following complications, he was transferred to Fiona Stanley Hospital in Perth and placed on life support in an induced coma; he did not regain consciousness, and died on the morning of 5 June 2015.\n\nThe Australian TV miniseries \"House of Bond\" (2017) is based on Bond's life and in it he is portrayed by Ben Mingay.\n\nThe Crowded House song \"Whispers and Moans\" from the album Woodface makes a reference to \"Alan's sound investments\" towards the end of the song, an ironic reference to Alan Bond's financial conduct \n\nNichola Schulz, http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/alan-bonds-life-story-the-subject-of-a-nine-miniseries-starring-samantha-jade-johnny-ruffo-and-ben-mingay/news-story/5bccbeb99fa7b63de9ceef173780ff62\n\n"}

Since its beginnings, the festival is held in its entirety on a special complex built specifically for the event on the slopes of mount Cobetas, located southwest from the city.\n\nThe first edition was organized by Basque musical promoter Last Tour International and sponsored by the Bilbao City Hall in the year 2006 under the name \"Bilbao Live Festival\". Since the following year, the festival has been sponsored by local savings bank Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa, who gave it its current name. The festival is the first of its kind and size to happen in the region. In the 2011 edition, the festival exceeded 100,000 visitors for the first time, doubling the 2006 attendance. The 2012 event was reported to left an economical impact estimated in over 17.5 million euros in the city.\n\nThe festival was nominated for \"Best Foreign Festival\" at the UK Festival Awards in 2010 and 2011, and for \"Best Medium-Sized European Festival\" at the European Festivals Awards three consecutive times in 2009-2011.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to establish a street circuit in the city for the Formula Renault 3.5 in July 2005, the city Government decided to fill in the summer events calendar with an open-air music festival. In early 2006, it approached local musical promoter Last Tour International, responsible for the organization of the Azkena Rock Festival, celebrated in nearby Vitoria-Gasteiz since 2002. The newborn festival received the name of \"Bilbao Live Festival\", and had a budget of 4.2 million euros. The newly developed area in mount Cobetas was chosen as the location, which included two main stages for the rock acts, two electronic music tents, one pop music tent, and several bars and shops. Over 40 national and international bands participated in the first edition, celebrated during three days between 13–15 July 2006. The headliners included American hard rock band Guns N' Roses, British bands Placebo and Pretenders, and Argentinians Andrés Calamaro and Ariel Roth, former members of rock band Los Rodríguez.\n\nOver 51,000 people attended this first edition, and was considered a \"success\". LTI representative, Alfonso Santiago praised the organization and the music acts, and defined the festival as a \"good starting point\". The festival was well received by critics, the authorities, and the general public, and a second edition for the next year was confirmed on 28 July 2006, with the possibility of making it a \"permanent musical event\" of the city's cultural offer.\n\nIn early 2007, local savings bank Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa decided to become an official sponsor for the festival, as part of the actions for its 100th anniversary celebration campaign. As a result, the festival's name was changed to \"Bilbao BBK Live\". Unlike other sponsorship renamings, where the sponsor's name is usually dropped in an informal context, this festival is commonly referred to as \"the BBK Live\" or simply \"the BBK\". The second edition enjoyed a \"significant budget rise\", and the area designated for the stages and camping was also increased from 70,000 to 110,000 m². The 2007 edition was also the first (and currently only) to be celebrated in June, a decision took based on the \"European summer festival calendar\". An extra date was also added, spanning two weekends, 21-22 and 28–29 June. American bands Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Incubus, New York Dolls, My Chemical Romance, and British heavy metal band Iron Maiden were among the international headliners for this edition, meanwhile local rock band Fito & Fitipaldis stood out among Spanish acts, and received the largest audience of the event. Over 95,000 people attended the event, and produced an economical impact estimated in 13 million euros.\n\nFor the 2008 edition, the festival moved back to its original dates in the first weekend of July and a three-day programme. This edition was headlined by American acts R.E.M., Lenny Kravitz, ZZ Top, and British bands The Police, The Prodigy, and Madness. This year saw the introduction of a new festival in the city; Kobetasonik was focused in heavy metal music, was headlined by Kiss and Judas Priest, and was held two weeks before BBK Live in the same venue at mount Cobetas. Bilbao BBK Live 08 was attended by a little less than 80,000 people, well below the expected 95,000. Rain and difficult access to the site, available only through shuttle buses provided by a private party instead of the city's public buses as in past editions, were seen as factors for the decrease in attendance. However, the edition was still considered a success, and despite a project of moving the festival to a new location at an abandoned amusement park in mount Artxanda, the organization decided to stick to Cobetas, and promised improvements in the area and services for 2009.\n\nThe fourth edition, held between 9–11 July 2009 suffered greatly from the financial crisis that struck Spain in that period. As a result, the line-up was considerately \"less commercial\", as defined by the organization. Headliners included Depeche Mode, Jane's Addiction, Kaiser Chiefs, Editors, and second-timers Placebo, among others. The festival received over 52,600 visitors, a \"foreseen decrease\", and although considered a \"step back\", the continuity of the festival was confirmed. This edition saw an increase of foreign visitors, a 5-point increase from the past edition, totaling 14,6%. Foreign attendees came principally from France and the United Kingdom. This was mainly due to a special offer aimed to anyone with a postal address outside of Spain, with a three-day ticket for £40, one third of the standard price.\n\nNumber of visitors: 51.000\n\nNumber of visitors: 94.712\nNumber of visitors: 79.810\nNumber of visitors: 52.663\nNumber of visitors: 76.579\nNumber of visitors: 103.083\nNumber of visitors: 110.000\nNumber of visitors: 105.000\nNumber of visitors: 120.000\nNumber of visitors: 120.000\nNumber of visitors: 102.865\n\nNumber of visitors: 112.114\n\nThe 2012 edition is said to have left an economical impact estimated in over 17.5 million euros, taking into account the expenditures of the general public, organization, sponsors, and artists during the three days of the festival. This indicates an increase of 1.3 million when compared to the previous edition. During festival days, the city's hotels had an occupancy rate of 95%. LTI spokesman, Alfonso Santiago, stated that Bilbao has established itself as the third Spanish concert capital, behind Madrid and Barcelona.\n\nAlong with \"Aste Nagusia\", the local patronage festival held each August, BBK Live is often cited as an important component of the city's cultural offer, and responsible for the 200,000 tourists that Bilbao receives each summer. Many travel agencies offer special packages with transportation, accommodation and festival tickets.\n\nBilbao BBK Live is an open-air festival that takes place at Kobetamendi, located in Mount Cobetas, southeast from the city centre. With , it is Bilbao's largest park. The venue is built each year around a 110,000 m² area and features three main stages, a DJs Tent, VIP zone, backstage facilities, food and drinks markets, and two camping areas, that total and have a total capacity of 15,000 people.\n\nSince 2011, the organization decided to arrange a series of spin-off concerts to be held at \"Sala BBK\", a small venue located at the centre of the city, on the Gran Vía, the city's main street. Under the name Bilbao BBK Live Bereziak (Basque: Bilbao BBK Live Specials), it consists of a cycle of small profile concerts with a very limited capacity, distributed along the year. Among the artists that participated in this specials are: Lambchop, M. Ward, and Tortoise.\n\n"}

Venues included the City of Camberwell Ballroom and Balwyn Community Centre. \n\nIn the events surrounding the sacking of the Camberwell Council in 1993, the Victorian Government's investigation into the council examined the circumstances under which the event was established.

{"id": "513149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=513149", "title": "Cannibal Holocaust", "text": "Cannibal Holocaust\n\nCannibal Holocaust is a 1980 Italian cannibal horror film directed by Ruggero Deodato and written by Gianfranco Clerici. It stars Robert Kerman as Harold Monroe, an anthropologist from New York University who leads a rescue team into the Amazon rainforest to locate a crew of filmmakers. Played by Carl Gabriel Yorke, Francesca Ciardi, Perry Pirkanen, and Luca Barbareschi, the crew had gone missing while filming a documentary on local cannibal tribes. When the rescue team is only able to recover the crew's lost cans of film, an American television station wishes to broadcast the footage as a sensationalized television special. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is appalled by the team's actions and objects to the station's intent to air the documentary. \n\nInfluenced by the documentaries of Mondo director Gualtiero Jacopetti, \"Cannibal Holocaust\" was inspired by Italian media coverage of Red Brigade terrorism. The coverage included news reports that Deodato believed to be staged, an idea which became an integral aspect of the film's story. Approximately half of the film consists of the documentary crew's lost footage, the presentation of which innovated the found footage genre that was later popularized in American cinema by \"The Blair Witch Project\". Noted for its realism, \"Cannibal Holocaust\" was filmed primarily on location in the Amazon rainforest of Colombia with indigenous tribes interacting with American and Italian actors.\n\n\"Cannibal Holocaust\" achieved notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a great deal of controversy. After its premiere in Italy, it was ordered to be seized by a local magistrate, and Deodato was arrested on obscenity charges. He was later charged with multiple counts of murder due to rumors that claimed several actors were killed on camera. Although Deodato was cleared of these charges, the film was banned in Italy, Australia, and several other countries due to its graphic content, including sexual assault and genuine violence toward animals. Although some nations have since revoked the ban, it is still upheld in several countries. In retrospective analyses, the film's violence has been noted as commentary on ethics in journalism, exploitation of developing countries, and the nature of modern society versus uncivilized society, although these interpretations have also been met with criticism.\n\nIn 1979, an American film crew disappears in the Amazon rainforest while filming a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists of Alan Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers. In anticipation of his arrival, the military conducts a raid on the local Yacumo tribe and takes a young male hostage in order to help negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via floatplane and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel.\n\nAfter several days of trekking through the jungle, the group encounters the Yacumo tribe. They arrange the release of their hostage in exchange for being taken to the Yacumo village. Once there, the group is initially greeted with hostility and learns that the filmmakers caused great unrest among the people. The next day, Monroe and his guides head deeper into the rainforest to locate two warring cannibal tribes, the Ya̧nomamö and the Shamatari. They encounter a group of Shamatari warriors and follow them to a riverbank, where they save a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from death. The Ya̧nomamö invite Monroe and his team back to their village in gratitude, yet they treat the outsiders with suspicion. To gain their trust, Monroe bathes naked in a river. A group of Ya̧nomamö women emerge from the riverbank to take him to a shrine, where he discovers the skeletal remains of the filmmakers. Angered, he confronts the Ya̧nomamö in the village, during which time he plays a tape recorder. The intrigued natives agree to trade it for the filmmakers' surviving reels of film.\n\nBack in New York, executives of the Pan American Broadcasting System invite Monroe to host a broadcast of the documentary to be made from the recovered film, but Monroe insists on viewing the raw footage before making a decision. The executives first introduce him to Alan's work by showing an excerpt from his previous documentary, \"The Last Road to Hell\", which depicts executions in several war-torn countries. One of the executives tells Monroe that Alan staged such dramatic scenes to get more exciting footage. Monroe then begins to view the recovered footage, which first follows the group's trek through the jungle. After walking for days, their guide, Felipe, is bitten by a venomous snake. The group amputates Felipe's leg with a machete to save his life, but he quickly dies and is left behind. The remaining four locate the Yacumo in a clearing, where Jack shoots one in the leg so they can easily follow him to the village. Once they arrive, the crew forces the tribe into a hut and burns it down in order to stage a massacre for their film. Monroe criticizes the staged scenes and poor treatment of the natives, but his concerns are ignored.\n\nMonroe finishes viewing the footage and expresses his disgust to the station executives regarding their decision to air the documentary. To convince them otherwise, he shows them the remaining, unedited footage that only he has seen. The final two reels begin with the film crew locating and capturing a Ya̧nomamö girl, whom the men take turns raping and filming. They later encounter the same girl impaled on a wooden pole by a riverbank, where they claim that the natives killed her for loss of virginity. Shortly afterwards, they are attacked by the Ya̧nomamö in revenge for the girl's rape and death. Jack is hit by a spear, and Alan shoots him to prevent his escape so that the team can film how the natives mutilate his corpse. As the three surviving team members try to escape the scene, Faye is captured, and Alan insists that they attempt to rescue her. Mark continues to film as she is stripped naked, gang-raped, beaten, and beheaded. The Ya̧nomamö then pursue and kill the last two team members as the camera drops to the ground in front of Alan's bloody face. Disturbed by what they have seen, the executives order the footage to be destroyed. As Monroe leaves the station, he ponders to himself who the \"real cannibals\" are.\n\nProduction on \"Cannibal Holocaust\" began in 1979, when director Ruggero Deodato was contacted by German film producers to make a film similar to \"Last Cannibal World\", which he had also directed. He accepted the project and immediately went in search of a producer, choosing his friend Francesco Palaggi. The two first flew to Colombia to scout for filming locations. Leticia, Colombia was chosen as the principal filming location after Deodato met a Colombian documentary filmmaker at the airport in Bogotá, who suggested the town as a location ideal for filming. Other locations had been considered, specifically those where Gillo Pontecorvo's \"Burn!\" had been shot, but Deodato rejected these due to lack of suitable rainforest. Leticia was only accessible by aircraft, and from there, the cast and crew had to travel by boat to reach the set. The locale presented many problems for the production, in particular the heat and sudden rain storms, which sporadically delayed filming.\n\nDeodato said he conceived of the film while talking to his son about news coverage of the terrorism of the Red Brigades. Deodato thought that the media focused on portraying violence with little regard for journalistic integrity and believed that the media staged certain news angles in order to obtain more sensationalized footage. He reflected this behavior in the film team in \"Cannibal Holocaust\", whom he said symbolized the Italian media.\n\nThe Italian screenwriter Gianfranco Clerici wrote the script under the working title \"Green Inferno\". He had collaborated with Deodato in his previous films \"Ultimo mondo cannibale\" and \"The House on the Edge of the Park\", the latter of which was filmed before \"Cannibal Holocaust\" but released afterward. The names of certain characters in the film were changed from Clerici's screenplay: the name \"Mark Williams\" was changed to \"Mark Tomaso\", and \"Shanda Tommaso\" was changed to \"Faye Daniels\".\n\nClerici also wrote several scenes that did not make the film's final cut, one of which depicted a group of Ya̧nomamö cutting off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranhas in the river. This scene was to take place directly after Monroe's team rescues a smaller group of Ya̧nomamö from the Shamatari. Attempts were made to film this scene, but the underwater camera did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control. As a result, Deodato abandoned his efforts, and still photographs taken during the scene are its only known depiction.\n\nFor the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced actors from the Actors Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast in part because they were Italian actors who also spoke English. Deodato decided to make the film in English to appeal to a wider audience and to lend the film credibility. However, he also needed to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking actors to star in the film.\n\nDeodato also hired Perry Pirkanen and another actor from the Actors Studio to play Jack Anders and Alan Yates, respectively. The latter dropped out shortly before the production team left for the Amazon, although he appears in the film as an ex-colleague of Yates. Casting director Bill Williams subsequently chose Carl Gabriel Yorke to replace him for the role. Yorke, a stage actor who had studied under Uta Hagen, was chosen in part because he was the right size for the costumes and boots, which had already been purchased. Because \"Cannibal Holocaust\" was a non-Union production, Yorke originally wanted to be credited under the alias Christopher Savage, but ultimately decided against doing so.\n\nRobert Kerman had years of experience working in adult films under the pseudonym R. Bolla, including the well-known \"Debbie Does Dallas\". Kerman was recommended to Deodato for his previous film, \"The Concorde Affair\", in which Kerman played an air traffic controller. Kerman went on to star in the Italian cannibal films \"Eaten Alive!\" and \"Cannibal Ferox\", both directed by Umberto Lenzi. Kerman's girlfriend at the time was cast as one of the station executives, as the production needed an actress to be available in both New York City and Rome.\n\nDeodato drew influence from the works of Paolo Cavara, Gualtiero Jacopetti and Franco Prosperi, documentary filmmakers of whom Deodato was a fan. Prosperi and Jacopetti produced several Mondo films, which are documentaries similar to the one made in \"Cannibal Holocaust\". These documentaries focused on sensationalistic and graphic content from around the world, including bizarre local customs, death, and general cruelty. Deodato followed suit in ways of similar content, such as graphic violence and animal slayings. Although fictional, Deodato created a similar exposé of worldly violence, such as Cavara's, Prosperi's and Jacopetti's \"Mondo Cane\".\n\nDeodato filmed \"Cannibal Holocaust\" using the \"cinéma vérité\" technique he learned from his mentor Roberto Rossellini, a style which production designer Massimo Antonello Gelend called \"hyperrealistic\". Film historian David Kerekes contends that the film's sense of reality is based on the direction and the treatment of the film team's recovered footage, noting that the \"shaky hand-held camerawork commands a certain realism, and 'The Green Inferno,' the ill-fated team's film-within-a-film here, is no exception,\" and that \"this very instability gives the 'Green Inferno' film its authentic quality.\" David Carter of the cult horror webzine \"Savage Cinema\" says that Deodato's methods added a first-person quality to the film team's footage, writing: \"The viewer feels as if they are there with the crew, experiencing the horrors with them.\" Deodato was proud of other aspects of the cinematography, namely the numerous moving shots using a standard, shoulder-mounted camera, foregoing the use of a steadicam.\n\nKerekes noted the animal slaughter and inclusion of footage from \"The Last Road to Hell\" as adding to the sense of reality of the film. Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Entertainment compares these scenes to Vsevolod Pudovkin's theory of montage, saying, \"In \"Cannibal Holocaust\", we see the actors kill and rip apart a giant sea turtle and other animals. [...] The brain has been conditioned to accept that which it's now seeing as real. This mixture of real and staged violence, combined with the handheld camerawork and the rough, unedited quality of the second half of the movie, is certainly enough to convince someone that what they are watching is real.\" Deodato says he included the execution footage in \"The Last Road to Hell\" to draw further similarities to \"Cannibal Holocaust\" and the Mondo filmmaking of Gualtiero Jacopetti.\n\nCertain scenes in \"Cannibal Holocaust\" have also been noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati's Mondo film \"Savana violenta\", specifically the scene in which Monroe bathes naked in the river and the scene of the forced abortion rite. The \"cinéma vérité\" style used heavily in \"Cannibal Holocaust\" was also used before in Climati's first Mondo film, \"Ultime grida dalla savana\", in a scene where a tourist is attacked and killed by a pride of lions. Another scene, in which a native man is captured, tortured, and murdered by mercenaries in South America, uses a similar filming style, and both scenes may have been influential on Deodato's direction.\n\nPrincipal photography began on 4 June 1979. The scenes featuring the film team were shot first with handheld 16mm cameras in a \"cinéma vérité\" style that mimicked an observational documentary. After shooting with the film team was completed, Kerman flew down to film his scenes in the rainforest and then to New York to film exterior shots in the city. The interior shots of New York were later filmed in a studio in Rome. Production on the film was delayed numerous times while filming in the Amazon. After the original actor to play Alan Yates dropped out, filming was halted for two weeks as new casting calls began, and the crew awaited the arrival of Yorke from New York City. During principal filming with Kerman, the father of the actor who played Miguel was murdered, and production was again halted as the actor flew back to Bogotá to attend his father's funeral.\n\nTensions on the Amazonian set were high, due in part to the location and to the nature of the production itself. Yorke describes the set as having \"a level of cruelty unknown to me,\" while Kerman described Deodato as remorseless and uncaring; he and Deodato got into long, drawn-out arguments every day of shooting, usually because of remarks made by Deodato. Cast members also experienced unscrupulous payment practices, which further heightened tensions. Yorke's first payment for the film came in the form of Colombian pesos and was less than what had been agreed upon. Yorke refused to continue shooting until he was paid fairly in United States dollars. The native extras also went unpaid for their work despite their involvement in numerous dangerous scenes, including a scene in which they were forced to stay inside a burning hut for a prolonged period of time. Robert Kerman also noted unfair treatment of the natives by Deodato, stating, \"He was a sadist. He was particularly sadistic to people that couldn't answer back, people that were Colombian, [and] people that were Italian but could be sent home.\"\n\nOne particular aspect that led to disagreement amongst the cast and crew was the genuine killing of animals. Kerman stormed off the set while the death of the coatimundi was filmed, and Yorke refused to participate in the killing of a pig, which he was originally scripted to execute, leaving the duty to Luca Barbareschi. When it was shot, the squeal of the pig subsequently caused Yorke to botch a long monologue, and retakes were not an option because they had no access to additional pigs. Perry Pirkanen cried after filming the butchering of a turtle, and crew members vomited off camera when a squirrel monkey was killed for the film. Actress Francesca Ciardi also objected to the film's sexual content and did not want to bare her breasts during the sex scene between her and Carl Yorke. When she refused to comply with Deodato's direction, he dragged her off the set and screamed at her in Italian. She had earlier suggested that she and Yorke actually have sex in the jungle before filming in order to relieve the tension of the upcoming scene. When Yorke declined, she grew upset with him, alienating him for the rest of the shoot.\n\nThe film's soundtrack was composed entirely by Italian composer Riz Ortolani, whom Deodato specifically requested because of Ortolani's work in \"Mondo Cane\". Deodato was particularly fond of the film's main theme, \"Ti guarderò nel cuore,\" which was given lyrics and became a worldwide pop hit under the title \"More.\" The music of \"Cannibal Holocaust\" is a variety of styles, from a gentle melody in the \"Main Theme,\" to a sad and flowing score in \"Crucified Woman,\" and faster and more upbeat tracks in \"Cameraman's Recreation,\" \"Relaxing in the Savannah,\" and \"Drinking Coco,\" to the sinister-sounding \"Massacre of the Troupe.\" The instrumentation is equally mixed, ranging from full orchestras to electronics and synthesizers.\n\n\"Cannibal Holocaust\" premiered on 7 February 1980 in the Italian city of Milan. Although the courts later confiscated the film based on a citizen's complaint, the initial audience reaction was positive. After seeing the film, director Sergio Leone wrote a letter to Deodato, which stated, \"[Translated] Dear Ruggero, what a movie! The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism, but everything seems so real that I think you will get in trouble with all the world.\" In the ten days before it was seized, the film had grossed approximately $2 million. In Japan, it grossed $21 million, becoming the second highest-grossing film of that time after \"E.T. the Extraterrestrial\". Because of its several subsequent re-releases, some claim the film has grossed $200 million worldwide.\n\nCritics remain split on their stances of \"Cannibal Holocaust\". Supporters of the film cite it as a serious and well-made social commentary on the modern world. Sean Axmaker praised the structure and setup of the film, saying, \"It's a weird movie with an awkward narrative, which Deodato makes all the more effective with his grimy sheen of documentary realism, while Riz Ortolani's unsettlingly lovely, elegiac score provides a weird undercurrent.\" Jason Buchanan of Allmovie said, \"While it's hard to defend the director for some of the truly repugnant images with which he has chosen to convey his message, there is indeed an underlying point to the film, if one is able to look beyond the sometimes unwatchable images that assault the viewer.\"\n\nDetractors, however, criticize the over-the-top gore and the genuine animal slayings and also point to an alleged hypocrisy that the film presents. Nick Schager criticized the brutality of the film, saying, \"As clearly elucidated by its shocking gruesomeness — as well as its unabashedly racist portrait of indigenous folks it purports to sympathize with [the real indigenous peoples in Brazil whose names were used in the film—the Ya̧nomamö and Shamatari—are not fierce enemies as portrayed in the film, nor is either tribe truly cannibalistic, although the Ya̧nomamö do partake in a form of post-mortem ritual cannibalism] — the actual savages involved with \"Cannibal Holocaust\" are the ones behind the camera.\"\n\nRobert Firsching of Allmovie made similar criticisms of the film's content, saying, \"While the film is undoubtedly gruesome enough to satisfy fans, its mixture of nauseating mondo animal slaughter, repulsive sexual violence, and pie-faced attempts at socially conscious moralizing make it rather distasteful morally as well.\" \"Slant Magazine\"'s Eric Henderson said it is \"artful enough to demand serious critical consideration, yet foul enough to christen you a pervert for even bothering.\"\n\nIn recent years, \"Cannibal Holocaust\" has received accolades in various publications as well as a cult following. The British film magazine \"Total Film\" ranked \"Cannibal Holocaust\" as the tenth greatest horror film of all time, and the film was included in a similar list of the top 25 horror films compiled by \"Wired\". The film also came in eighth on IGN's list of the ten greatest grindhouse films.\n\n\"Cannibal Holocaust\" is seen by some critics as social commentary on various aspects of modern civilization by comparing Western society to that of the cannibals. David Carter says \"\"Cannibal Holocaust\" is not merely focused on the societal taboo of flesh eating. The greater theme of the film is the difference between the civilized and the uncivilized. Though the graphic violence can be hard for most to stomach, the most disturbing aspect of the film is what Deodato is saying about modern society. The film asks the questions 'What is it to be 'civilized'?' and 'Is it a good thing?'\" Mark Goodall, author of \"Sweet & Savage: The World Through the Shockumentary Film Lens\", also contends the film's message is \"the rape of the natural world by the unnatural; the exploitation of 'primitive' cultures for western entertainment.\"\n\nDeodato's intentions regarding the Italian media coverage of the Red Brigades have also fallen under critical examination and has been expanded to include all sensationalism. Carter explores this, claiming that \"[The lack of journalistic integrity] is shown through the interaction between Professor Monroe and the news agency that had backed the documentary crew. They continually push Monroe to finish editing the footage because blood and guts equal ratings.\" Lloyd Kaufman claims that this form of exploitative journalism can still be seen in the media today and in programming such as reality television. Goodall and film historians David Slater and David Kerekes have also suggested that Deodato was attempting to comment on the documentary works of Antonio Climati with his film.\n\nDespite these interpretations, Deodato has said in interviews that he had no intentions in \"Cannibal Holocaust\" but to make a film about cannibals. Actor Luca Barbareschi asserts this as well and believes that Deodato only uses his films to \"put on a show\". Robert Kerman contradicts these assertions, however, stating that Deodato did tell him of political concerns involving the media in the making of this film.\n\nThese interpretations have also been criticized as hypocritical and poor justification for the film's content, as \"Cannibal Holocaust\" itself is highly sensationalized. Firsching claims that \"The fact that the film's sole spokesperson for the anti-exploitation perspective is played by porn star Robert Kerman should give an indication of where its sympathies lie\", while Schager says Deodato is \"pathetically justifying the unrepentant carnage by posthumously damning his eaten filmmaker protagonists with a 'who are the real monsters – the cannibals or us?' anti-imperialism morale\".\n\nSince its original release, \"Cannibal Holocaust\" has been the target of censorship by moral and animal activists. Other than graphic gore, the film contains several scenes of sexual violence and genuine cruelty to animals, issues which find \"Cannibal Holocaust\" in the midst of controversy to this day. Due to this notoriety, \"Cannibal Holocaust\" has been marketed as having been banned in over 50 countries. In 2006, \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine named \"Cannibal Holocaust\" as the 20th most controversial film of all time.\n\nTen days after its premiere in Milan, \"Cannibal Holocaust\" was confiscated under the orders of a local magistrate, and Ruggero Deodato was arrested and charged with obscenity. As all copies were to be turned over to the authorities, the film was distributed internationally via subterfuge. In January 1981, during the film's theatrical run in France, the magazine \"Photo\" suggested that certain deaths depicted in the film were real, which would have made \"Cannibal Holocaust\" a snuff film. Following the publication of the \"Photo\" article, the charges against Deodato were amended to include murder. The courts believed that the actors who portrayed the missing film crew and the native actress featured in the impalement scene were killed for the camera.\n\nCompounding matters was the fact that the supposedly deceased actors had signed contracts with the production which ensured that they would not appear in any type of media, motion pictures, or commercials for one year following the film's release. This was done in order to promote the idea that \"Cannibal Holocaust\" was truly the recovered footage of missing documentarians. During the subsequent court proceedings, questions arose as to why the actors were in no other media if they were alive as Deodato claimed.\n\nTo prove his innocence, Deodato had Luca Barbareschi get in contact with the other three actors, and the four of them were interviewed for an Italian television show. Deodato also explained in court how the special effect in the impalement scene was achieved: a bicycle seat was attached to the end of an iron pole, upon which the actress sat. She then held a short length of balsa wood in her mouth and looked skyward, thus giving the appearance of impalement. Deodato also provided the court with pictures of the girl interacting with the crew after the scene had been filmed. After they were presented with this evidence, the courts dropped all murder charges against Deodato.\n\nAlthough the snuff film allegations were disproven, the Italian courts decided to ban \"Cannibal Holocaust\" due to the genuine animal slayings, citing animal cruelty laws. Deodato, Franco Palaggi, Franco Di Nunzio, Gianfranco Clerici, producer Alda Pia and United Artists Europa representative Sandro Perotti each received a four-month suspended sentence after they were all convicted of obscenity and violence. Deodato fought in the courts for three additional years to get his film unbanned. In 1984, the courts ruled in favor of Deodato, and \"Cannibal Holocaust\" was granted a rating certificate of VM18 for a cut print. It would later be re-released uncut.\n\n\"Cannibal Holocaust\" also faced censorship issues in other countries around the world. In 1981, video releases were not required to pass before the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), which had power to ban films in the United Kingdom. \"Cannibal Holocaust\" was released straight-to-video there, thus avoiding the possible banning of the film. In 1983, the Director of Public Prosecutions compiled a list of 72 video releases that were not brought before the BBFC for certification and declared them prosecutable for obscenity. This list of \"video nasties\" included \"Cannibal Holocaust\", which was successfully prosecuted and banned. The film was not approved for release in the UK until 2001, albeit with nearly six minutes of mandated cuts. In 2011, the BBFC waived all but one of these previous edits and passed \"Cannibal Holocaust\" with fifteen seconds of cuts. It was determined that the only scene that breached the BBFC's guidelines was the killing of a coatimundi, and the BBFC acknowledged that previous cuts were reactionary to the film's reputation.\n\nThe film was also banned in Australia, Norway, Finland, New Zealand, and several other countries in 1984. In 2005, the Office of Film and Literature Classification in Australia revoked the ban, passing \"Cannibal Holocaust\" with an R18+ rating for the uncut print, including the consumer advice, \"High level sexual violence, high level violence, animal cruelty.\" In 2006, the film was rejected for classification and banned in its entirety by the OFLC in New Zealand. Cuts to retain an R18 classification were offered by the Office, but they were eventually refused.\n\nMany of the censorship issues with \"Cannibal Holocaust\" concern the on-screen killings of animals. Deodato himself has condemned his past actions, saying \"I was stupid to introduce animals.\" Although six animal deaths appear onscreen, seven animals were killed for the production, as the scene depicting the monkey's death was shot twice, resulting in the death of two monkeys. Both of the animals were eaten by indigenous cast members, who consider monkey brains a delicacy. The animals that were killed onscreen were:\n\n\nFilm historian Andrew DeVos has argued that the animal deaths have been harshly condemned because of the film's classification as exploitation, whereas animal mutilations in films perceived by critics to be classics or art films are often ignored. DeVos cites several examples of this double standard, including \"The Rules of the Game\", \"El Topo\", and \"Apocalypse Now\". The BBFC made a similar conclusion regarding the censorship of scenes in which the deaths were quick and painless, noting, \"Removing these sequences would be inconsistent with the BBFC's decisions to permit quick clean kills in several other films, such as \"Apocalypse Now\".\"\n\n\"Cannibal Holocaust\" was innovative in its plot structure, specifically with the concept of the \"found footage\" being brought back to civilization and later viewed to determine the fate of the crew that shot it. This was later popularized as a distinct style in Hollywood cinema by \"The Last Broadcast\" and \"The Blair Witch Project\", both of which use similar storytelling devices. Each film uses the idea of a lost film team making a documentary in the wilderness, and their footage returned. Advertisements for \"The Blair Witch Project\" also promoted the idea that the footage is genuine. Deodato has acknowledged the similarities between his film and \"The Blair Witch Project\", and though he holds no malice against the producers, he is frustrated at the publicity that \"The Blair Witch Project\" received for being an original production. The producers of \"The Last Broadcast\" have denied that \"Cannibal Holocaust\" was a major influence. Nonetheless, the film was cited by director Paco Plaza as a source of inspiration for the found footage films \"REC\" and \"REC 2\".\n\n\"Cannibal Holocaust\" has been regarded as the apex of the cannibal genre, and it bears similarities to subsequent cannibal films made during the same time period. \"Cannibal Ferox\" also stars Kerman and Pirkanen, and star Giovanni Lombardo Radice says it was made based on the success of \"Cannibal Holocaust\". \"Cannibal Ferox\" has also been noted as containing similar themes to \"Cannibal Holocaust\", such as comparison of Western violence to perceived uncivilized cultures and anti-imperialism. In a mixed review, film journalist Jay Slater claims, \"Certainly a tough customer, \"Cannibal Ferox\" still fails where Deodato succeeds. [...] Lenzi attempts to tackle cultural defilement and racial issues, but \"Cannibal Ferox\" is nothing more than a shoddy exercise in sadism and animal cruelty.\" Reviewer Andrew Parkinson also notes, \"At the end, there is a basic attempt to validate \"Cannibal Ferox\", posing that old chestnut of whether civilised man is actually more savage than the uncivilised tribespeople.\"\nUnofficial sequels to \"Cannibal Holocaust\" were produced in the years following its release. The titles of these films were changed following their original theatrical releases in order to associate the film with \"Cannibal Holocaust\" in different markets. In 1985, Mario Gariazzo directed \"Schiave bianche: violenza in Amazzonia\", which was also released as \"Cannibal Holocaust 2: The Catherine Miles Story\". In addition to the new title, Slater notes similarities between the score in \"The Catherine Miles Story\" and Riz Ortolani's score in \"Cannibal Holocaust\". Previously known for his work in Mondo films, Antonio Climati directed \"Natura contro\" in 1988, which was released as \"Cannibal Holocaust II\" in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2005, Deodato announced that he planned to make a companion piece to \"Cannibal Holocaust\" entitled \"Cannibals\". Deodato was originally hesitant about directing his new film, as he thought that he would make it too violent for American audiences. However, while he was in Prague filming his cameo appearance in \"\" for Eli Roth, Deodato viewed \"Hostel\" and decided that he would direct after all, citing it as a similarly violent film that was given a mainstream release in America. Although the screenplay, written by Christine Conradt, was completed, a financial conflict between Deodato and the film's producer led to the project's cancellation. In 2013, Roth directed \"The Green Inferno\", which takes its title from the fictional documentary produced in \"Cannibal Holocaust\". Roth's film was intended as an homage to \"Cannibal Holocaust\" and other cannibal films from the same era.\n\nThe film's influence has extended to other media as well. In 2001, Death metal band Necrophagia released a song entitled \"Cannibal Holocaust\" from the eponymous record. British Author Saurav Dutt also published \"Cannibal Metropolis\", a novel inspired by \"Cannibal Holocaust\" set in an urban location. Like \"Cannibal Holocaust\", the novelization features explicit scenes of violence, horror, and rape.\n\nDue to its graphic content, there are several different versions of \"Cannibal Holocaust\" in circulation which are edited to varying degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the BBFC with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.\nThe versions released by Grindhouse Releasing contains an \"Animal Cruelty Free\" version of the film that cuts out the six animal deaths. Other versions also contain alternative footage shot specifically for Middle Eastern markets that does not depict nudity.\n\nThere are multiple versions of the \"Last Road to Hell\" segment of the film, which causes variances even among uncensored releases. An extended version of \"The Last Road to Hell\" includes approximately ten seconds of footage not seen in an alternative, shorter version. This additional footage includes a wide-angle shot of firing-squad executions, a close-up of a dead victim, and extended footage of bodies being carried into the back of a truck. The longer version also includes different titles that correctly name the film team as they appear in the final film, while the shorter version gives the names of the film team that originally appear in the script.\n\nThe longer version of \"The Last Road to Hell\" is no longer found in the film's negatives, but it was included in the original Dutch Ultrabit DVD release by EC Entertainment in 1999. This digital version has since been re-released and licensed for other various DVD releases in Europe. The Grindhouse Releasing DVD release in the United States and the Siren Visual release in Australia have the shorter version of \"The Last Road to Hell\" within the feature film but include the extended version in the special features on the first disc.\n\n"}

For the first year it was called the Graduate 797 series (the first \"7\" for Caterham Seven, and \"97\" from the year that most drivers started competing). In its first two years, it was a multi-discipline series, with the rounds being made up of sprints (single car on track, against the clock), hillclimbs, and circuit races, similar to the Caterham Scholarship format. The emphasis moved more and more towards circuit races, and from 2000-on the series has been entirely circuit races.\n\nIn 2001, following the Caterham Academy's change to Rover-engined cars, the championship launched a second class named Super Graduates, based upon an uprated K-Series Academy car.\n\nIn 2003, the Super Graduates class was further upgraded and renamed the Mega Graduates. A replacement Super Graduates class was created to accommodate standard ex-Academy cars with Rover K-series engines.\n\nIn 2007, the \"Graduates\" class was rebranded \"Classic Graduates\".\n\nIn 2010, Ford Sigma-engined cars were introduced as a sub-class of Super Graduates. From 2011 onwards, the Sigma cars have been a separate, 4th championship class.\n\nIn 2013, a 5th championship class was introduced for variants of the Ford Sigma-engined cars - SigMax. This allows suspension and engine upgrades in line with the Caterham Tracksport and Supersport series.\n\nThe series is one of the largest in the UK, if not the largest, with well over 100 registered competitors. The competitors come from a variety of backgrounds - a number have \"graduated\" from the novice Caterham Scholarship and Academy series, whilst many others have made it their first foray into motorsport.\n\nThe Caterham Graduates race series takes place over a number of races meeting each year at UK and European motor racing circuits. The races are usually run over 20–30 minutes and the leading car across the line after the time has expired is the winner. Wherever possible, each class starts on its own grids, but on larger grids it is usually necessary to combine two or more classes. The events are typified by close wheel to wheel racing, often having several lead changes on the same lap.\n\nIn Super Graduates and Mega Graduates, points are awarded thus: 40 for a win, 39 for 2nd place, 38 for 3rd place, right down to 2 points for finishing 39th or lower. It is 30 points for a win in Classic Graduates and Sigma Graduates, as they generally have slightly smaller grids. And even a driver who fails to finish will still earn one point. At the end of the season, drivers drop their lowest three scores, to allow for missing a race or two, or a \"DNF\" (did not finish).\n\nIn addition to the standard MSA motorsport rules, the club operates a Driving Standards function which ensures that the close racing is fair and safe for all.\n\nThe club's racing is organised through the BARC.\n\nThe cars in the series are genuinely road-going, although Mega and SigMax Graduates spec is moving away from this with the deletion of lights, and indeed a few are driven to and (hopefully) from races. Many are used by drivers mid-week for transport to work and for shopping, needing no more than the covering up of competition numbers to make them road-legal. No changes from the standard specification are allowed, putting the emphasis firmly on driving ability rather than car development and set-up. Along with low consumable costs, this keeps the costs of running a car very much under control, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to go racing. The large grid sizes are a testament to this low-cost formula.\n\nCurrent classes are:\n\n1600cc Ford or Vauxhall engined Caterham Sevens with a live axle, from the Caterham Scholarship or Academy 1995 - 2000. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 100 bhp.\n\n1600cc Ford Sigma-engined cars from the 2008 Caterham Academy onwards or 2009/10 Roadsport B. The only significant permitted changes are a swap to stickier Yokohama A048R tyres and an optional rear anti-roll bar. The cars have independent DeDion rear suspension, produce around 120 bhp and are fully road-legal.\n\n1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with DeDion rear suspension from the Caterham Academy 2001 - 2007 or Roadsport B up to 2008. A current \"Roadsport A\" spec car can be converted into a Super Graduate relatively easily and at low cost. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 125 bhp.\n\nUprated 1600cc Ford Sigma-engined cars from the 2008 Caterham Academy onwards or 2009/10 Roadsport B. No lights or windscreen, widetrack suspension, controlled engine upgrades and lightened flywheel.\n\nUprated 1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with independent (DeDion) rear suspension from the Caterham Academy 2001 - 2008. These cars are semi-road legal (no lights or windscreen) and with controlled modifications produce around 140 bhp.\n\nAll classes run on Yokohama road legal tyres. Classic Graduates race on MSA list 1A A539s, whilst Sigmas, Supers, Sigmax and Megas use the stickier list 1B A048R (medium compound)\n\nAffordability is a key ingredient to Caterham Graduates racing. Strict regulations allow only limited modifications and work on the sealed engines is limited to nominated engine builders - McMillan Motorsport and - for Sigmas and K-series only - Caterham Cars.\n\nOther ways the club promotes affordability include limiting the amount of tyres the drivers can use through the season, providing race-day catering as part of the drivers' membership fees, and encouraging drivers either to stay on-site at the circuits or in budget hotels locally.\n\nRace numbers 1 - 49 go to Mega Graduates, 51 - 69 to Sigma Graduates, 71 - 99 to Classic Graduates, 101 - 149 to Super Graduates and 151-199 to Sigmax Graduate cars.\n\nThe lower race numbers represent a driver's performance in the previous season, as the first ten numbers in each class are reserved for those finishing in the previous year's top ten. For instance, Ian Anderson's number 171 indicates that he came 1st in Sigma Graduates in 2011. Higher numbers go to those who are new to the championship or class.\n\n\n\nAbout a dozen or so companies have their branding across each of the 100-plus racecars, and on the club's website www.graduates.org.uk.\n\nRelatively few of the drivers have individual sponsors, although this is permitted.\n"}

{"id": "56206", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56206", "title": "Crop circle", "text": "Crop circle\n\nA crop circle or crop formation is a pattern created by flattening a crop, usually a cereal. The term was first coined in the early 1980s by Colin Andrews. Crop circles have been described as all falling \"within the range of the sort of thing done in hoaxes\" by Taner Edis, professor of physics at Truman State University. Although obscure natural causes or alien origins of crop circles are suggested by fringe theorists, there is no scientific evidence for such explanations, and all crop circles are consistent with human causation. A person who studies crop circles is known as a cereologist.\n\nThe number of crop circles has substantially increased from the 1970s to current times. There has been little scientific study of them. Circles in the United Kingdom are not distributed randomly across the landscape but appear near roads, areas of medium to dense population and cultural heritage monuments, such as Stonehenge or Avebury. In 1991, two hoaxers, Bower and Chorley, took credit for having created many circles throughout England after one of their circles was described by a circle investigator as impossible to be made by human hand.\n\nFormations are usually created overnight, although some are reported to have appeared during the day. In contrast to crop circles or crop formations, archaeological remains can cause cropmarks in the fields in the shapes of circles and squares, but they do not appear overnight, and they are always in the same places every year.\n\nThe concept of \"crop circles\" began with the original late-1970s hoaxes by Doug Bower and Dave Chorley (see Bower and Chorley, below). They said that they were inspired by the Tully \"saucer nest\" case in Australia, where a farmer claimed to first have seen a UFO, then found a flattened circle of swamp reeds.\n\nA 1678 news pamphlet \"The Mowing-Devil: or, Strange News Out of Hartfordshire\" is claimed by some cereologists to be the first depiction of a crop circle. Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider it to be a historical precedent because it describes the stalks as being cut rather than bent (see folklore section).\n\nIn 1686, British naturalist Robert Plot reported on rings or arcs of mushrooms (see fairy rings) in \"The Natural History of Stafford-Shire\" and proposed air flows from the sky as a cause. In 1991 meteorologist Terence Meaden linked this report with modern crop circles, a claim that has been compared with those made by Erich von Däniken.\n\nAn 1880 letter to the editor of \"Nature\" by amateur scientist John Rand Capron describes how a recent storm had created several circles of flattened crops in a field.\n\nIn 1932, archaeologist E C Curwen observed four dark rings in a field at Stoughton Down near Chichester, but could examine only one: \"a circle in which the barley was 'lodged' or beaten down, while the interior area was very slightly mounded up.\"\n\nIn 1963, amateur astronomer Patrick Moore described a crater in a potato field in Wiltshire, which he considered was probably caused by an unknown meteoric body. In nearby wheat fields, there were several circular and elliptical areas where the wheat had been flattened. There was evidence of \"spiral flattening\". He thought they could be caused by air currents from the impact, since they led towards the crater. Astronomer Hugh Ernest Butler observed similar craters and said they were likely caused by lightning strikes.\n\nIn the 1960s, in Tully, Queensland, Australia, and in Canada, there were many reports of UFO sightings and circular formations in swamp reeds and sugar cane fields. For example, on 8 August 1967, three circles were found in a field in Duhamel, Alberta, Canada; Department of National Defence investigators concluded that it was artificial but couldn't say who made them or how. The most famous case is the 1966 Tully \"saucer nest\", when a farmer said he witnessed a saucer-shaped craft rise 30 or from a swamp and then fly away. On investigating he found a nearly circular area 32 feet long by 25 feet wide where the grass was flattened in clockwise curves to water level within the circle, and the reeds had been uprooted from the mud. The local police officer, the Royal Australian Air Force, and the University of Queensland concluded that it was most probably caused by natural causes, like a down draught, a willy-willy (dust devil), or a waterspout. In 1973, G.J. Odgers, Director of Public Relations, Department of Defence (Air Office), wrote to a journalist that the \"saucer\" was probably debris lifted by the causing willy-willy. Hoaxers Bower and Chorley said they were inspired by this case to start making the modern crop circles that appear today.\n\nSince the 1960s, there had been a surge of UFOlogists in Wiltshire, and there were rumours of \"saucer nests\" appearing in the area, but they were never photographed. There are other pre-1970s reports of circular formations, especially in Australia and Canada, but they were always simple circles, which could have been caused by whirlwinds. In \"Fortean Times\" David Wood reported that in 1940 he had already made crop circles near Gloucestershire using ropes. In 1997, the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" recorded the earliest usage of the term \"crop circles\" in a 1988 issue of \"Journal of Meteorology\", referring to a BBC film. The coining of the term \"crop circle\" is attributed to Colin Andrews in the late 1970s or early 1980s.\n\nThe majority of reports of crop circles have appeared in and spread since the late 1970s as many circles began appearing throughout the English countryside. This phenomenon became widely known in the late 1980s, after the media started to report crop circles in Hampshire and Wiltshire. After Bower's and Chorley's 1991 statement that they were responsible for many of them, circles started appearing all over the world. To date, approximately 10,000 crop circles have been reported internationally, from locations such as the former Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, the U.S., and Canada. Sceptics note a correlation between crop circles, recent media coverage, and the absence of fencing and/or anti-trespassing legislation.\n\nAlthough farmers expressed concern at the damage caused to their crops, local response to the appearance of crop circles was often enthusiastic, with locals taking advantage of the increase of tourism and visits from scientists, crop circle researchers, and individuals seeking spiritual experiences. The market for crop-circle interest consequently generated bus or helicopter tours of circle sites, walking tours, T-shirts, and book sales.\n\nSince the start of the 21st century, crop formations have increased in size and complexity, with some featuring as many as 2,000 different shapes and some incorporating complex mathematical and scientific characteristics.\n\nThe researcher Jeremy Northcote found that crop circles in the UK in 2002 were not spread randomly across the landscape. They tended to appear near roads, areas of medium-to-dense population, and cultural heritage monuments such as Stonehenge or Avebury. He found that they always appeared in areas that were easy to access. This suggests strongly that these crop circles were more likely to be caused by intentional human action than by paranormal activity. Another strong indication of that theory was that inhabitants of the zone with the most circles had a historical tendency for making large-scale formations, including stone circles such as Stonehenge, burial mounds such as Silbury Hill, long barrows such as West Kennet Long Barrow, and .\n\nIn 1991, self-professed pranksters Doug Bower and Dave Chorley made headlines claiming it was they who started the phenomenon in 1978 with the use of simple tools consisting of a plank of wood, rope, and a baseball cap fitted with a loop of wire to help them walk in a straight line. To prove their case they made a circle in front of journalists; a \"cereologist\" (advocate of paranormal explanations of crop circles), Pat Delgado, examined the circle and declared it authentic before it was revealed that it was a hoax. Inspired by Australian crop circle accounts from 1966, Bower and Chorley claimed to be responsible for all circles made prior to 1987, and for more than 200 crop circles in 1978–1991 (with 1000 other circles not being made by them). After their announcement, the two men demonstrated making a crop circle. According to Professor Richard Taylor, \"the pictographs they created inspired a second wave of crop artists. Far from fizzling out, crop circles have evolved into an international phenomenon, with hundreds of sophisticated pictographs now appearing annually around the globe.\"\n\n\"Smithsonian\" magazine wrote:\n\nSince the early 1990s, the UK arts collective \"Circlemakers,\" founded by artists Rod Dickinson and John Lundberg (and subsequently including artists Wil Russell and Rob Irving), have been creating crop circles in the UK and around the world as part of their art practice and for commercial clients.\n\nThe Led Zeppelin boxed set that was released on 7 September 1990, along with the remasters of the first boxed set, as well as the second boxed set, all feature an image of a crop circle that appeared in East Field in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire.\n\nOn the night of 11–12 July 1992, a crop-circle making competition with a prize of £3,000 (funded in part by the Arthur Koestler Foundation) was held in Berkshire. The winning entry was produced by three Westland Helicopters engineers, using rope, PVC pipe, a plank, string, a telescopic device and two stepladders. According to Rupert Sheldrake, the competition was organised by him and John Michell and \"co-sponsored by The Guardian and The Cerealogist\". The prize money came from \"PM\", a German magazine. Sheldrake wrote that \"The experiment was conclusive. Humans could indeed make all the features of state-of-the-art crop formations at that time. Eleven of the twelve teams made more or less impressive formations that followed the set design.\"\n\nIn 2002, Discovery Channel commissioned five aeronautics and astronautics graduate students from MIT to create crop circles of their own, aiming to duplicate some of the features claimed to distinguish \"real\" crop circles from the known fakes such as those created by Bower and Chorley. The creation of the circle was recorded and used in the Discovery Channel documentary \"Crop Circles: Mysteries in the Fields\".\n\nIn 2009, \"The Guardian\" reported that crop circle activity had been waning around Wiltshire, in part because makers preferred creating promotional crop circles for companies that paid well for their efforts.\n\nA video sequence used in connection with the opening of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London showed two crop circles in the shape of the Olympic rings. Another Olympic crop circle was visible to passengers landing at nearby Heathrow Airport before and during the Games.\n\nA crop circle depicting the emblem of the \"Star Wars\" Rebel Alliance was created in California in December 2017 by an 11-year-old boy as a spaceport for X-wing fighters.\n\nIn 1992, Hungarian youths Gábor Takács and Róbert Dallos, both then 17, were the first people to face legal action after creating a crop circle. Takács and Dallos, of the St. Stephen Agricultural Technicum, a high school in Hungary specializing in agriculture, created a diameter crop circle in a wheat field near Székesfehérvár, southwest of Budapest, on June 8, 1992. On September 3, the pair appeared on Hungarian TV and exposed the circle as a hoax, showing photos of the field before and after the circle was made. As a result, Aranykalász Co., the owners of the land, sued the teens for 630,000 Ft (~$3,000 USD) in damages. The presiding judge ruled that the students were only responsible for the damage caused in the circle itself, amounting to about 6,000 Ft (~$30 USD), and that 99% of the damage to the crops was caused by the thousands of visitors who flocked to Székesfehérvár following the media's promotion of the circle. The fine was eventually paid by the TV show, as were the students' legal fees.\n\nIn 2000, Matthew Williams became the first man in the UK to be arrested for causing criminal damage after making a crop circle near Devizes. In November 2000, he was fined £100 and £40 in costs. , no one else has been successfully prosecuted in the UK for criminal damage caused by creating crop circles.\n\nThe scientific consensus on crop circles is that they are constructed by human beings as hoaxes, advertising, or art. The most widely known method for a person or group to construct a crop formation is to tie one end of a rope to an anchor point and the other end to a board which is used to crush the plants. Sceptics of the paranormal point out that all characteristics of crop circles are fully compatible with their being made by hoaxers.\n\nBower and Chorley confessed in 1991 to making the first crop circles in southern England. When some people refused to believe them, they deliberately added straight lines and squares to show that they could not have natural causes. In a copycat effect, increasingly complex circles started appearing in many countries around the world, including fractal figures. Physicists have suggested that the most complex formations might be made with the help of GPS and lasers. In 2009, a circle formation was made over the course of three consecutive nights and was apparently left unfinished, with some half-made circles.\n\nThe main criticism of alleged non-human creation of crop circles is that while evidence of these origins, besides eyewitness testimonies, is essentially absent, some are definitely known to be the work of human pranksters, and others can be adequately explained as such. There have been cases in which researchers declared crop circles to be \"the real thing\", only to be confronted with the people who created the circle and documented the fraud, like Bower and Chorley and tabloid \"Today\" hoaxing Pat Delgado, the Wessex Sceptics and Channel 4's \"Equinox\" hoaxing Terence Meaden, or a friend of a Canadian farmer hoaxing a field researcher of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network. In his 1997 book \"The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark\", Carl Sagan concludes that crop circles were created by Bower and Chorley and their copycats, and speculates that UFOlogists willingly ignore the evidence for hoaxing so they can keep believing in an extraterrestrial origin of the circles. Many others have demonstrated how complex crop circles can be created. \"Scientific American\" published an article by Matt Ridley, who started making crop circles in northern England in 1991. He wrote about how easy it is to develop techniques using simple tools that can easily fool later observers. He reported on \"expert\" sources such as \"The Wall Street Journal\", who had been easily fooled and mused about why people want to believe supernatural explanations for phenomena that are not yet explained. Methods of creating a crop circle are now well documented on the Internet.\n\nSome crop formations are paid for by companies who use them as advertising. Many crop circles show human symbols, like the heart and arrow symbol of love, stereotyped alien faces,\n\nHoaxers have been caught in the process of making new circles, such as in 2004 in the Netherlands for example (see more cases in \"legal implications\" section above).\n\nAdvocates of non-human causes discount on-site evidence of human involvement as attempts to discredit the phenomena. Some even argue a conspiracy theory, with governments planting evidence of hoaxing to muddle the origins of the circles. When Ridley wrote negative articles in newspapers, he was accused of spreading \"government disinformation\" and of working for the UK military intelligence service MI5. Ridley responded by noting that many cereologists make good livings from selling books and providing high-priced personal tours through crop fields, and he claimed that they have vested interests in rejecting what is by far the most likely explanation for the circles.\n\nIt has been suggested that crop circles may be the result of extraordinary meteorological phenomena ranging from freak tornadoes to ball lightning, but there is no evidence of any crop circle being created by any of these causes.\n\nIn 1880, an amateur scientist, John Rand Capron, wrote a letter to the editor of journal \"Nature\" about some circles in crops and blamed them on a recent storm, saying their shape was \"suggestive of some cyclonic wind action\".\n\nIn 1980, Terence Meaden, a meteorologist and physicist, proposed that the circles were caused by whirlwinds whose course was affected by southern England hills. As circles became more complex, Terence had to create increasingly complex theories, blaming an electromagneto-hydrodynamic \"plasma vortex\". The meteorological theory became popular, and it was even referenced in 1991 by physicist Stephen Hawking who said that, \"Corn circles are either hoaxes or formed by vortex movement of air\". The weather theory suffered a serious blow in 1991, but Hawking's point about hoaxes was supported when Bower and Chorley stated that they had been responsible for making all those circles. By the end of 1991 Meaden conceded that those circles that had complex designs were made by hoaxers.\n\nSince becoming the focus of widespread media attention in the 1980s, crop circles have become the subject of speculation by various paranormal, ufological, and anomalistic investigators ranging from proposals that they were created by bizarre meteorological phenomena to messages from extraterrestrial beings. There has also been speculation that crop circles have a relation to ley lines. Many New Age groups incorporate crop circles into their belief systems.\n\nSome paranormal advocates think that crop circles are caused by ball lighting and that the patterns are so complex that they have to be controlled by some entity. Some proposed entities are: Gaia asking to stop global warming and human pollution, God, supernatural beings (for example Indian devas), the collective minds of humanity through a proposed \"quantum field\", or extraterrestrial beings.\n\nResponding to local beliefs that \"extraterrestrial beings\" in UFOs were responsible for crop circles appearing, the Indonesian National Institute of Aeronautics and Space (LAPAN) described crop circles as \"man-made\". Thomas Djamaluddin, research professor of astronomy and astrophysics at LAPAN stated, \"We have come to agree that this 'thing' cannot be scientifically proven.\" Among others, paranormal enthusiasts, ufologists, and anomalistic investigators have offered hypothetical explanations that have been criticized as pseudoscientific by sceptical groups and scientists, including the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. No credible evidence of extraterrestrial origin has been presented.\n\nIn 2009, the attorney general for the island state of Tasmania stated that Australian wallabies had been found creating crop circles in fields of opium poppies, which are grown legally for medicinal use, after consuming some of the opiate-laden poppies and running in circles.\n\nA small number of scientists (physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, the late biophysicist William Levengood) have found differences between the crops inside the circles and outside them, citing this as evidence they were not man-made.\n\nLevengood published papers in journal \"Physiologia Plantarum\" in 1994 and 1999. In his 1994 paper he found that certain deformities in the grain inside the circles were correlated to the position of the grain inside the circle. In 1996 sceptic Joe Nickell objected that correlation is not causation, raised several objections to the Levengood's methods and assumptions, and said \"Until his work is independently replicated by qualified scientists doing 'double-blind' studies and otherwise following stringent scientific protocols, there seems no need to take seriously the many dubious claims that Levengood makes, including his similar ones involving plants at alleged 'cattle mutilation' sites.\" (in reference to cattle mutilation).\n\nA study by Eltjo Haselhoff reported that the pulvini of wheat in 95% of the crop circles investigated were elongated in a pattern falling off with distance from the centre and that seeds from the bent-over plants grew much more slowly under controlled conditions. Furthermore, traces of crop circle patterns are sometimes found in the crop the following year, \"suggesting long-term damage to the crop field consistent with Levengood's observations of stunted seed growth.\"\n\nIn 2000, Colin Andrews, who had researched crop circles for 17 years, stated that while he believed 80% were man-made, he thought the remaining circles, with less elaborate designs, could be explained by a three-degree shift in the Earth's magnetic field, that creates a current that \"electrocutes\" the crops, causing them to flatten and form the circle.\n\nResearchers of crop circles have linked modern crop circles to old folkloric tales to support the claim that they are not artificially produced. Circle crops are culture-dependent: they appear mostly in developed and secularized Western countries where people are receptive to New Age beliefs, including Japan, but they don't appear at all in other zones, such as Muslim countries.\n\nFungi can cause circular areas of crop to die, probably the origin of tales of \"fairie rings\". Tales also mention balls of light many times but never in relation to crop circles.\n\nA 17th-century English woodcut called the \"Mowing-Devil\" depicts the devil with a scythe mowing (cutting) a circular design in a field of oats. The pamphlet containing the image states that the farmer, disgusted at the wage his mower was demanding for his work, insisted that he would rather have \"the devil himself\" perform the task. Crop circle researcher Jim Schnabel does not consider this to be a historical precedent for crop circles because the stalks were cut down, not bent. The circular form indicated to the farmer that it had been caused by the devil.\n\nIn the 1948 German story \"Die zwölf Schwäne\" (\"The Twelve Swans\"), a farmer every morning found a circular ring of flattened grain on his field. After several attempts, his son saw twelve princesses disguised as swans, who took off their disguises and danced in the field. Crop rings produced by fungi may have inspired such tales since folklore holds these rings are created by dancing wolves or fairies.\n\n\n\n"}

Dan Baines, a sculptor and illusion designer, managed to sell his creation, the fake corpse of a fairy, on an internet auction for nearly £300.\n\nA few days before April 1, 2007, Dan Baines, a 31-year-old illusion designer for magicians from London, posted images on his website purporting to show the remains of a fairy. He claimed the mummified remains were discovered by a dog walker at Firestone Hill in Duffield, Derbyshire. The \"corpse\", as shown in the pictures, had intact ears, wings, hair, skin and teeth, and had, according to Baines, ‘been examined by anthropologists and forensic experts who can confirm the body is genuine’. According to the website, X-rays of the 'fairy' showed that its body's structure was the same as that of a child. The bones, however, were described to be ‘hollow like those of a bird, making them particularly light.’\n\nIn spite of the coming of April Fool's Day, the website received feedback from a large number of fairy believers, accumulating over 20,000 hits in one day. On April 1, Baines appended a note to the website, thanking the readers for expressing their interest in his story and acknowledging that the fairy corpse was fake. He wrote: \"Even if you believe in fairies, as I personally do, there will always have been an element of doubt in your mind that would suggest the remains are a hoax. However, the magic created by the possibility of the fairy being real is something you will remember for the rest of your life.\" Subsequently, Baines listed the mummified fairy on eBay and the model attracted nearly 40 bids. The highest at the close of the sale was made by a private art collector in the United States and the fairy was sold for £280.\n\nBaines received hundreds of emails in response, including comments from those who claimed to have found similar fairy remains. \"There was one person who was quite upset because I revealed the place where the fairy was found,\" he said. When Baines admitted that the dead fairy was in fact a model created by himself as an April Fools' prank and its back-story was a hoax, some still believed it was genuine, accusing Baines of covering up the 'truth' about the existence of fairies and deliberately issuing false information to harm the credibility of those who believe in them. It was noted that the number of queries sent to Baines regarding the dead fairy did not slow down after the revelation of his hoax. After the event, he described the response to his prank as \"uncanny\" and that it had taken him up to four hours a day to respond to the emails he had been receiving regarding the subject.\n\n"}

Initially debuting at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2006, \"El Cantante\" was released on August 3, 2007.\n\nDistributed by Picturehouse, the film runs for 106 minutes and is rated R for language, sexuality and drug use.\n\nAccording to Box Office Mojo, \"El Cantante\" is the twenty-sixth highest-grossing musical biopic of all time.\n\nPuchi (Jennifer Lopez) talks about her late husband, salsa legend Héctor Lavoe \"El Cantante De Los Cantantes\" (\"The singer of all the singers\") (Marc Anthony), during a 2002 interview. Héctor Pérez leaves Puerto Rico, even though his father tries to persuade him not to go because if he does he'll lose a father. Héctor decides to go anyway against his father's will in an attempt to pursue his dreams. On his first night in the city he meets Eddie (Manny Pérez) and discovers the new sound of salsa flowing through the streets. He eventually becomes the lead singer in a salsa group performing in a bar. One night he is approached by salsa musician, Willie Colón (John Ortiz) and Johnny Pacheco. Johnny offers them a deal with Fania Records Company and Hector accepts. The company also suggests that he change his name to Héctor Lavoe. \"Lavoe\" meaning \"the voice\" in French. \n\nHéctor falls in love with Puchi, a girl who danced at the club where he performed. He confesses to her that his mother died when he was young, his brother was killed the night he came to New York and that he didn't have many people in his life. She tells him that they'll take care of each other. It is revealed that Héctor was cheating on Puchi with another girl named Carmen. Puchi reveals that Carmen and she were pregnant with a baby of his at the same time. But she is the only woman of his life because he chose her. They eventually get married and have a son named Tito. On a night of hard partying, Héctor catches Eddie doing drugs and does so too. This will be the start of his drug addiction. \n\nThrough the years, after Héctor's consistent tardiness to gigs, Willie grows tired of Héctor's irresponsibility and decides to go solo. Héctor's drug and alcohol addiction continues to grow stronger and becomes very noticeable. Puchi is infuriated when she finds Tito eating alone and Héctor shooting up while the gas was on. She begs Héctor to quit the drugs and to turn his life around for their son and because he is always high and is missing out and she loves him. \n\nOne night, Puchi wakes up to Héctor sitting with a gun staring into space, suicidally depressed. In fear she sends him to rehab. Puchi can't help feeling extremely guilty when Héctor's sister Priscilla blames all of Héctor's problems on her. She later takes him out and he is put on medication. A jealous Héctor calls Puchi a whore and frequently accuses her of having affairs with many different men. Héctor maintains sobriety and takes his family to Puerto Rico for vacation. When Héctor tries to reconcile with his father after leaving against his will, he rejects Héctor. This causes him more pain. He is diagnosed with HIV and advises Puchi to get tested as well. He maintains sobriety for a while but soon has a relapse and goes back to his old ways. Puchi and Héctor fight often and it usually ends with him leaving the house and then coming back and apologizing to her. \n\nTito is killed when his friend accidentally shoots him while playing with the gun Héctor kept in the house. This scars Héctor for the rest of his life. In the interview, Puchi admits that Héctor was never the same after that, and he died along with their son. She says everyone expected too much from him. Héctor confesses to Willie that he loves Puchi and that he wishes he would've done things differently, but it's too late and nothing is the same anymore. Willie encourages him to perform at a gig in Puerto Rico. At the concert, there is less than half of the audience due to bad managing and advertising. Still, he decides to perform for the few people who still showed up while it starts raining. He just couldn't hold in all the pain anymore. The depression and guilt are too much for Héctor to handle and it drives him to attempt suicide by jumping out a window. He survives the fall and lives another 5 years. \n\nPuchi is seen in her new apartment, listening to a voice mail from Hector, wishing her a happy birthday and that he'll always be there and love her. She smiles and begins to dance while looking at a picture of her and Héctor on the wall. The movie ends with Héctor performing and the credits revealing that he died at the age of 46 of AIDS, from sharing needles. It is also, revealed that Puchi died shortly after this interview in 2002.\n\n\n\"El Cantante\", which has an MPAA rating of R, was first premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival which took place in September 2006. It was then released to over 542 cinemas on August 3, 2007. The film opened at No. 12 at the U.S. Box Office, grossing $3,202,035 during its opening weekend. It averaged around $6,000 per theater. The following week, it grossed $1,401,148 and fell to No. 16. It left the chart at No. 115 on the week of September 28, 2007, after grossing $1,465. \"El cantante\" grossed $7,556,712 domestically and $354,820 overseas, totaling $7.9 million.\n\nCharlotte O'Sullivan of the \"Evening Standard\" said the \"film did not go down well\" at the Box Office, crediting its lack of commercial success to Lopez and Anthony \"know[ing] nothing about salsa\" and its \"negative view of the Latino community by focusing on Lavoe’s drug use and death from Aids\", which had sparked controversy. The film's DVD was released on October 30, 2007. It became a hit, ranking at No. 8 on the DVD/Home Rentals chart at Box Office Mojo, and had grossed $16.61 million in DVD sales as of December 23, 2007.\n\nFollowing its Toronto International Film Festival premiere, \"El Cantante\" earned mostly negative reviews from critics and currently holds a 25% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 106 reviews.\n\nRobert Koehler of \"Variety\" felt that the biopic, which contained \"many standard-issue biopic montage sequences\", was only \"geared for the bigscreen, but the fairly bland visual design will make pic more than suitable to be seen on the tube\". Koehler was critical of both performances, feeling that while Lopez brought \"plenty of ferocity\" to her character, there wasn't \"shape\" or \"power\" to her \"wrath\", and labeled Anthony \"the dullest of movie drug addicts\".\n\nA.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" felt that Anthony as Lavoe was hidden behind \"his high, delicate cheekbones and tinted glasses\" but \"Whenever Héctor takes the stage, however, Mr. Anthony unleashes his charisma, and shows that, whatever his limitations as an actor, he is a brilliant performer\". Scott praised Lopez's performance, noting that it had \"a lot of fight\" with \"a hard, skeptical edge\" that made Puchi \"a more interesting and plausible character than her husband\". Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine gave the film and Anthony's performance a positive review, but was critical of Lopez, calling her performance \"predictably self-conscious\" but said her sequences \"complements Puchi's own\". Renee Schonfield of Common Sense Media gave \"El Cantante\" a negative review, \"brings the magic of salsa music to the screen; unfortunately, it also brings the audience another bleak story of a flameout singer bent on self-destruction\".\n\nKevin Maher of \"The Times\" was negative, stating that the \"soft-pedalled account of Lavoe's rise to fame and his drug-related downfall that has more in common with the biopic parody Walk Hard than anything as muddy as real life\". Claudia Puig of \"USA Today\" said Anthony \"gives a fine and impassioned performance\" in a story that \"relies on formula and clichés of the genre\" which meant \"we don't learn enough about what caused the Puerto Rican-born Lavoe's downward spiral into drug use, promiscuity and suicide attempts after he gained fame in New York City\". Additionally, Puig criticized Lopez's airtime by stating \"the film has far too much of her and not enough of Anthony\".\n\nPeter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\", in a review based primarily on Lopez, panned her performance and said \"There is something entirely dead about Lopez's performance. No matter how superficially lively she makes it, she is always simply mouthing the lines\". On the other hand, Charlotte O'Sullivan of the \"Evening Standard\" praised Lopez and her character, \"Lopez deserves praise for pushing this project. The recently deceased Puchi (who helped generate the script and pushed for Lopez to play her) is not the kind of character you see on screen every day. She has not been whitewashed and neither, thank goodness, has her husband\".\n\nThe film was criticized, and accused of \"usurping barrio culture and exploiting Lavoe's memory\", with salsa singer Ismael Miranda condemning it for \"focusing too much on the tragic artist's drug abuse, which eventually led to his death from AIDS complications\". Other celebrities who criticized the film included singer Domingo Quiñones, and vocalist Cheo Feliciano. Willie Colón, Lavoe's long time friend and musical partner, was critical of the film. Although he had been hired as a consultant for \"El cantante\", he was not pleased with the end result, stating:\n\"The creators of El Cantante missed an opportunity to do something of relevance for our community. The real story was about Hector fighting the obstacles of a nonsupportive industry that took advantage of entertainers with his charisma and talent. Instead they did another movie about two Puerto Rican junkies\".\nAdditionally, Colón blamed Lopez and Anthony:\n\"It's difficult to comprehend how two individuals who are in the music business like Marc and Jennifer are not aware of the damage and the consequences of promoting only the negative side of our Latin music culture\". And while the film was predominantly a love story, Colón also noted that in real life, he believed Puchi caused Lavoe's drug problems, but was canonized \"so that Jennifer can play her\". David L. Coddon of \"U-T San Diego\" said following the film's release, \"Latino pop culture's highest-profile couple is taking heat from salsa purists who complain that the film, about salsa legend Hector Lavoe, is a distortion, even an exploitation\", while also stating Lopez is \"one of the most famous women in the world, and there's nothing her critics can do to change that\".\n\nNPR's Felix Contreras weighed in on the criticism, pointing out that \" any time you have a portrayal of an artist where they reflect a history of drug abuse or alcohol abuse\" there would always be criticism, and \"in this case, some folks are arguing that the film was focusing on that drug abuse, and not necessarily on what he generated or what he contributed to the music\". When commenting on the film, Lopez felt her performance should have earned an Oscar nomination and blamed the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for overlooking both the film and her performance.\n\n"}
{"id": "199629", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199629", "title": "Evita (musical)", "text": "Evita (musical)\n\nEvita is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics and book by Tim Rice. It concentrates on the life of Argentine political leader Eva Perón, the second wife of Argentine president Juan Perón. The story follows Evita's early life, rise to power, charity work, and eventual death.\n\nThe musical began as a rock opera concept album released in 1976. Its success led to productions in London's West End in 1978, winning the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical, and on Broadway a year later, where it was the first British musical to receive the Tony Award for Best Musical.\n\nThis has been followed by a string of professional tours and worldwide productions and numerous cast albums, as well as a major 1996 film of the musical starring Madonna and Antonio Banderas. The musical was revived in London in 2006, and on Broadway in 2012, and toured the UK again in 2013–14 before running for 55 West End performances at the Dominion Theatre in September–October 2014. \n\nAct I\n\nIn 1952 Buenos Aires, Argentina, a crowd is watching a film (\"A Cinema in Buenos Aires, July 26, 1952\") that is interrupted when news breaks of the death of First Lady Eva Perón. Both the crowd and the nation go into public mourning (\"Requiem for Evita\") as Ché, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did \"nothing, for years\" (\"Oh What a Circus\").\n\nIn 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte lives in the provincial town of Junín, and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva falls in love with a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, after she meets him at one of his shows (\"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\"). Eva persuades Magaldi into taking her with him to Buenos Aires and though he is initially resistant, he eventually accepts (\"Eva, Beware of the City\"). Upon her arrival at the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress (\"Buenos Aires\"). After her arrival, Eva is quick to leave Magaldi, and Che relates the story of how Eva sleeps her way up the social ladder, becoming a model, radio star, and actress (\"Goodnight and Thank You\"). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Perón, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder (\"The Lady's Got Potential\"). In a game of musical chairs that represents the rise of political figures, Perón and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy (\"The Art of the Possible\").\n\nAfter a devastating earthquake hits the town of San Juan, Perón organises a charity concert at Luna Park to provide aid to the victims. Eva attends and briefly reunites with Agustín Magaldi, who coldly shuns her for her past actions. Perón addresses the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva as soon as he exits (\"Charity Concert\"). Eva and Perón share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Perón rise to power (\"I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You\"). Eva dismisses Perón's Mistress (the character is known only by that title), who ponders the rejection (\"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\").\n\nUpon moving in with Perón, Eva is introduced to high society only to be met with disdain from the upper classes and the Argentine Army (\"Perón's Latest Flame\"). In 1946, after launching his presidential bid, Perón discusses his chances of winning the election with Eva. After reassuring him of their chances of winning, Eva organizes rallies for the \"descamisados\" and gives them hope for a better future while Perón and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way (\"A New Argentina\").\n\nAct II\n\nPerón is elected president in a sweeping victory in 1946. He stands \"On The Balcony of the Casa Rosada\" addressing his \"descamisados\" (shirtless ones). Eva speaks from the balcony of the Presidential Palace to her adoring supporters, where she reveals that despite her initial goal of achieving fame and glory, she has found her true calling to be the people of her country (\"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\"). Che analyses the price of fame as Eva dances at the Inaugural Ball with Perón, now the president-elect (\"High Flying, Adored\").\n\nEva insists on a glamorous image to impress the people of Argentina and promote Perónism. She prepares to tour in Europe as she is dressed for success by her fashion consultants (\"Rainbow High\"). Her famous 1946 tour meets with mixed results (\"Rainbow Tour\"); Spaniards adore her, but the Italians liken her husband to Benito Mussolini. France is unimpressed, and the English snub her by inviting her to a country estate, rather than Buckingham Palace. Eva affirms her disdain for the upper class, while Che asks her to start helping those in need as she promised (\"The Actress Hasn't Learned the Lines (You'd Like to Hear)\"). Eva begins the Eva Perón Foundation to direct her charity work. Che describes Eva's controversial charitable work, and possible money laundering (\"And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)\").\n\nEva appears at a church to take the sacrament in front of her adoring supporters (\"Santa Evita\"), but passes out suddenly, and while passed out, appears to have dream that reflects upon the conflicting views of her life. In her dream, she and Che heatedly debate her actions; Che accuses Eva of using the Argentine people for her own ends, while Eva cynically replies that there is no glory in trying to solve the world's problems from the sidelines (\"A Waltz for Eva and Che\"). At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits to herself and Che that she is dying and can't go on for much longer. Afterward, Eva finally understands that Perón loves her for herself, not just for what she can do for him and his career (\"You Must Love Me\"). Che points out the disastrous results of Perón's policies on Argentina: its treasury is bankrupt, its once-thriving beef industry under rationing, and the press and other critics of the regime muzzled.\n\nPerón's generals finally get sick of Eva's meddling and demand that Perón force her to leave politics. However, Perón objects and claims that if it wasn't for her, they would never have achieved as much as they have (\"She Is a Diamond\"). But he also concedes she won't be able to keep working for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer. Even so, Eva is determined to run for vice-president, and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists she can continue, despite her failing health (\"Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet\").\n\nRealizing she is close to death, Eva renounces her pursuit of the vice presidency and swears her eternal love to the people of Argentina (\"Eva's Final Broadcast\"). Eva's achievements flash before her eyes before she dies (\"Montage\"), and she asks for forgiveness, contemplating her choice of fame instead of long life (\"Lament\"). Eva dies, and embalmers preserve her body forever. Che notes that a monument was set to be built for Evita but \"only the pedestal was completed when Evita's body disappeared for 17 years...\"\n\n\nAct I\n\nAct II\n\nNotes\n\n\nIn 1972, Robert Stigwood proposed that Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice develop a new musical version of \"Peter Pan\", but they abandoned the project.\n\nTravelling late to a meal one night in 1973, though, Rice heard the end of a radio show about Eva Perón which intrigued him. As a child stamp collector, he had been fascinated by her image on the Argentine stamps, but was unaware of her significance in Argentina's history. He began research and was introduced by a Cinema International Corporation executive to the Argentine film director Carlos Pasini Hansen who had produced the TV film \"Queen of Hearts\", which had aired in the UK on 24 October 1972. The executive also arranged for Rice to see the film at Thames Television which he did \"at least twenty times\" saying also that \"by that time I had seen Pasini's superbly researched film, I was hooked.\" The more Rice investigated Eva Perón, going so far as to travel to Buenos Aires to research her life with many documents and contacts that Pasini had supplied, the more fascinated he became by the woman; he even named his first daughter after her.\n\nRice suggested the idea of a musical based on the subject to Lloyd Webber, but although the idea of writing a score including tangos, pasos dobles, and similar Latin flavours intrigued him, Lloyd Webber ultimately rejected the idea. He decided instead to collaborate with Alan Ayckbourn on \"Jeeves\", a traditional Rodgers and Hart-style musical based on the P. G. Wodehouse character, which proved to be a critical and commercial failure. After \"Jeeves\", Lloyd Webber returned to Rice, and they began developing Rice's proposed musical.\n\nThe authors of the 1996 book \"Evita: The Real Life of Eva Perón\" claim the musical was based on Mary Main's biography \"The Woman with the Whip\", which was extremely critical of Eva Perón. Though Rice praised the Main biography, it was never officially credited as source material. Rice created a character, Che, to serve as a narrator and Greek chorus. Although he had recently discovered Che Guevara was Argentine, he did not necessarily intend that the character be based upon him, despite inserting specific biographical details into the lyrics that clearly apply to Guevara. When Harold Prince later became involved with the project, he insisted that the actors portraying Che should use Guevara as a role model. In the 1996 film adaptation, the character returned to his more anonymous roots. This was also the case for the 2006 London revival.\n\nLloyd Webber and the conductor Anthony Bowles presented the musical at the second Sydmonton Festival before making the recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nAs they had previously done with \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", the songwriting team decided to record \"Evita\" as an album musical and selected actress and singer Julie Covington to sing the title role, after having caught an episode of Rock Follies and remembered her from the original London production of \"Godspell\". The recording, which was released by MCA Records who had previously marketed \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", commenced in April 1976 and was produced by Lloyd Webber and Rice. The recording was engineered by David Hamilton Smith, whose work Rice later acknowledged was effectively that of a third producer. He also delivered the line, \"Statesmanship is more than entertaining peasants,\" a rebuttal to Eva's balcony speech on the album.\n\nReleased in 1976, the two-record set included Paul Jones as Juan Perón, Colm Wilkinson as Che, Barbara Dickson as Perón's mistress, and Tony Christie as Agustín Magaldi. The writers had originally considered Steve Marriott and John Fogerty but neither was interested. Murray Head, who had enormous success with the \"Superstar\" album, recorded some demos but Rice later admitted they \"didn't really reproduce the magic that his portrayal of Judas had.\" Colm Wilkinson had recently played Judas in the London production of \"Superstar\" and agreed to audition: \"It only took a couple of verses to know he was our man.\"\n\nMike d'Abo, who had succeeded Paul Jones as lead singer of Manfred Mann, had a minor role on the album which was notable as the first one which both had appeared. Mike Smith, former lead vocalist with the Dave Clark Five and d'Abo's then working partner, also appeared.\n\nPasini wrote the dialogue in Spanish of the first scene, \"A Cinema in Buenos Aires, 26 July 1952\". On this recording, he played the part of the actor in the soundtrack of a movie that grinds to a halt and also read the official communique of Eva's death. When the album was presented to the press at Lloyd Webber's country home Sydmonton, Pasini organised a photographic presentation with his colleague Anton Furst to accompany it. His contribution to the development of the project was recognised as Rice and Lloyd Webber acknowledged him first in a thank you speech afterwards.\n\nIn Britain, Australia, South Africa, South America, and various parts of Europe, sales of the concept album exceeded those of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\"; in the United States, however, it never achieved the same level of success. Covington's recording of \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\" (originally titled \"It's Only Your Lover Returning\") was released in October 1976. It reached #1 on the UK Singles Chart and enjoyed similar success internationally. Dickson's \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\" also became a hit. In the US and UK, respectively, Karen Carpenter, Olivia Newton-John, and Petula Clark released cover versions of \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\".\n\nThe musical employs an eclectic range of styles. Classical music in \"Evita\" includes the opening choral piece (\"Requiem for Evita\") and a choral interlude in \"Oh What a Circus\", as well as instrumental passages throughout the musical such as the orchestral version of the \"Lament\" and the introduction to \"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\". Rhythmic Latinate styles are heard in pieces such as \"Buenos Aires\", \"And the Money Kept Rolling in (And Out)\" and \"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\", while ballads include \"High Flying, Adored\" and \"Another Suitcase in Another Hall\". Rock music includes \"Oh What a Circus\", \"Perón's Latest Flame\", and a song cut from the original production called \"The Lady's Got Potential\". The song was reinstated for the 1996 film with revised lyrics by Rice, and has also been used in Japanese, Czech, and Danish stage productions to expand on Argentine history for audiences less familiar with the subject.\n\nTomas Eloy Martinez noted:\n\nThe lyrics and storyline of the musical are based on Mary Main's biography, \"Evita: The Woman with the Whip\", which drew heavily upon the accounts of anti-Perónist Argentines. Shortly after the musical appeared, Nicholas Fraser and Marysa Navarro published a more neutral account of Eva Perón's life, \"Evita: The Real Lives of Eva Perón\", in which they claim that many of Main's assertions (which had influenced Rice's lyrics) were false, such as the suggestion that Eva had first gone to Buenos Aires as the mistress of a married musician, Agustín Magaldi. Instead, they wrote, Eva's mother Doña Juana had taken her there when she aspired to become a radio actress. Some critics also suggested that Rice's lyrics disparaged Evita's achievements unnecessarily, particularly her charity work. According to Navarro and Fraser,[\"Evita\"] was based for the most part on the earliest and seamiest versions of Evita's life, something happened to the tale in its retelling and the Evita who emerged each evening, dressed first as a teenager, then a hooker, and finally, in tulle and silver foil, as First Lady, was far from being unsympathetic.\n\nFollowing the success of the film version of \"Evita\", in 1996, an Argentinean film biography of Eva Perón was released, \"\", asserting that it corrected distortions in the musical's account.\n\nWhen the recording was released, Lloyd Webber had sent a copy to the renowned American director Harold Prince and invited him to become involved with the eventual staging. Prince agreed, commenting, \"Any opera that begins with a funeral can't be all bad\", but he advised them that he could not take on any new commitments for the next two years. In the meantime, Lloyd Webber and Rice reworked several elements of the show. Some songs were dropped and some shortened, while others were introduced and some lyrics rewritten. Prince eventually confirmed that he would be ready to start rehearsals in early 1978. When he began working on the project in May, he suggested few changes, other than for deleting Che's rock number \"The Lady's Got Potential\". Prince requested a song he could stage to chart Perón's rise to power, and Rice and Lloyd Webber responded with the musical chairs number \"The Art of the Possible\", during which military officers are eliminated until only Perón remains.\n\n\"Evita\" opened at the Prince Edward Theatre on 21 June 1978 and closed on 18 February 1986, after 3,176 performances. Elaine Paige played Eva with David Essex as Che, Joss Ackland as Perón, and Siobhán McCarthy as Mistress. Paige was selected from among many hopefuls, after Julie Covington declined the role. The production was directed by Harold Prince, choreographed by Larry Fuller, and produced by Robert Stigwood. Paige was succeeded by Marti Webb, Stephanie Lawrence, Siobhán McCarthy (who had played The Mistress when the show opened), Jacquey Chappell and ultimately, Kathryn Evans with Maria Morgan.\n\nWebb originally played the role during Paige's holiday and was persuaded by Prince to remain in the cast as an alternate for two shows each week to aid the transition when she took over the role. This set the precedent until the show closed, with Lawrence becoming Webb's alternate. Michele Breeze, Paige's original understudy never inherited the role in London but later created it for the original New Zealand production. Susannah Fellows also understudied Eva.\n\nGary Bond replaced David Essex as Che, then Mark Ryan, who had first starred as Magaldi, later assumed the role, followed by Martin Smith and Jimmy Kean. Ackland's replacements included John Turner, Oz Clark and Daniel Benzali.\n\nIn his review in \"The Sunday Times\", Derek Jewell called the show \"quite marvellous\" and described Lloyd Webber's \"ambitious\" score \"an unparallelled fusion of 20th century musical experience\" and Rice's lyrics as \"trenchant\" and \"witty\". Bernard Levin of \"The Times\" disliked it, however, calling it as an \"odious artefact ... that calls itself an opera ... merely because the clichés between the songs are sung rather than spoken\" and \"one of the most disagreeable evenings I have ever spent in my life\".\n\nThis production won The Society of West End Theatre (S.W.E.T) award as Musical of the Year, and Elaine Paige won the award for Performance of the Year in a Musical. Harold Prince (Director of the Year) and David Essex (Performance of the Year in a Musical) received S.W.E.T. nominations.\n\nTimothy O'Brien and Tazeena Firth collaborated on the design of the show. The set was minimal, with a scaffolded balcony running along the back and sides of the stage and images projected onto a screen above. Madame Tussauds produced a wax figurine of Eva, based on Elaine Paige, for the coffin during the funeral scene at the beginning of the show. Inspired by the murals of Diego Rivera, Prince suggested the proscenium be flanked by artwork depicting the struggles of the Argentine peasants. He jettisoned the original monochromatic costumes designed for the chorus members and dancers; instead, he had them go to charity and secondhand clothing shops to purchase costumes. The now iconic balcony scene featured Eva in a broad, white dress based on one actually owned by Eva Perón addressing a crowd from the rear balcony of the stage.\n\nThe \"Evita: Original London Cast Recording\" was recorded in 1978 and released by MCA Records. Some releases mistakenly refer to the concept album as the Original London Cast Recording.\n\nThe original London production transferred to the Opera House in Manchester for an extended run following its closure at the Prince Edward Theatre. Kathryn Evans and Jimmy Kean played Eva and Che with Ria Jones and John Barr being their alternates.\n\nAfter debuting at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, with a subsequent engagement at the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco, the Broadway production opened at the Broadway Theatre on 25 September 1979 and closed on 26 June 1983, after 1,567 performances and 17 previews. Patti LuPone starred as Eva, with Mandy Patinkin as Che, Bob Gunton as Perón, Mark Syers as Magaldi, and Jane Ohringer as Perón's mistress. Harold Prince directed with choreography by Larry Fuller. During the run, six actresses alternated playing the title role, in addition to LuPone: Terri Klausner (matinees), Nancy Opel (matinees), Pamela Blake (matinees), Derin Altay, Loni Ackerman and Florence Lacey. Patinkin was replaced by James Stein and later by Anthony Crivello. \"New York Times\" critic Frank Rich stated: \"Loni Ackerman, the current Eva Perón, has no discernible Latin blood, but she sings the role better than any of the American Evitas, as well as acting and dancing it with nonstop energy. Anthony Crivello, a performer new to me, is easily the best Che I've seen in New York or London: not only does he have a supple voice, but he also moves with such grace that he lightens the heavy, moralizing tone his character must bear. He's so effective, in fact, that he almost convinces you that there's a sound reason for Che Guevara to be dragged into the Peron saga.\" Tom Carter understudied Patinkin and performed as Che.\n\nLuPone has stated about her time in \"Evita\":\" 'Evita' was the worst experience of my life,' she said. 'I was screaming my way through a part that could only have been written by a man who hates women. And I had no support from the producers, who wanted a star performance onstage but treated me as an unknown backstage. It was like Beirut, and I fought like a banshee.'\"\n\nElaine Paige was originally told she would re-create her role in the Broadway production, however, the Actors' Equity Association refused permission for a non-American. Prince attempted to persuade the organisation for a second time when LuPone was suffering vocal problems before the production reached New York. Lupone stated in her memoir that this was nothing more than a rumour started by Prince himself to build publicity. She however had her own doubts about that being true.\n\nThe original Australian production opened at the Adelaide Festival Theatre on 30 April 1980. It featured Jennifer Murphy as Eva, John O'May as Che, Peter Carroll as Perón, Tony Alvarez as Magaldi, and Laura Mitchell as Perón's mistress.\n\nThe first Spanish language version premiered at the Teatro Monumental in Madrid on 23 December 1980, directed by Jaime Azpilicueta and with Paloma San Basilio as Eva, Patxi Andión as Che, Julio Catania as Perón, Tony Landa as Magaldi and Montserrat Vega as Perón's mistress. A double album recorded by the original cast was released and the song \"No llores por mí Argentina\" became a hit single. This production later played in Barcelona and in other cities in Latin America.\n\nIn Mexico City the show premiered at the Teatro Ferrocarrilero on 26 June 1981, with Valeria Lynch and Rocío Banquells alternating as Eva, Jaime Garza and Javier Díaz Dueñas alternating as Che, Jorge Pais as Perón, César Millán as Magaldi and Carmen Delgado as Perón's mistress.\n\nDirected by Maurício Shermann and starring Cláudia as Evita, Mauro Mendonça as Péron, Carlos Augusto Strazzer as Che, Sílvia Massari as Perón's mistress, and Hildon Prado as Magaldi, it premiered at Teatro João Caetano in Rio de Janeiro on 12 January 1983. It later moved to Teatro Palace in São Paulo in 1986. It opened to great success in Brazil, with the Brazilian singer Cláudia being considered by some critics as the best Evita of all the time. English producers Robert Stigwood and David Land, after watching the Brazilian production, said that Cláudia was the best Evita of all the singers who had played the role.\n\nOn 2 June 2006, the first major London production of \"Evita\" since the original had closed 20 years earlier opened in the West End at the Adelphi Theatre. Directed by Michael Grandage, Argentine actress Elena Roger debuted as Eva, while Philip Quast appeared as Perón with Matt Rawle as Che. Its libretto included \"You Must Love Me\", written for the 1996 film, but which had not yet been included in an English-language stage production. The production opened to very positive reviews, but ticket sales were slow, which resulted in its closure on 26 May 2007 after a run of less than a year. Quast and Roger were nominated for Olivier Awards for their performances.\n\nThe Stratford Shakespeare Festival produced \"Evita\" as its first rock musical from 28 to 6 May November 2010. The principal characters are played by Chilina Kennedy (Eva), Juan Chioran (Juan), and Josh Young (Che), with direction by Gary Griffin.\n\nA second Brazilian production directed by Jorge Takla premiered at Teatro Alfa in March 2011, with Paula Capovilla as Evita, Daniel Boaventura as Perón and Fred Silveira as Che.\n\nA Broadway revival of the show, based upon the 2006 West End production, ran at the Marquis Theatre, with Elena Roger in the title role, Ricky Martin as Che, Michael Cerveris as Perón, Max von Essen as Magaldi (he is also Ricky Martin's understudy) and Rachel Potter as Mistress. Christina DeCicco alternated with Roger as Eva. Michael Grandage again directed the production with choreography by Rob Ashford, set and costume design by Christopher Oram and lighting design by Neil Austin. ThItas produced by Hal Luftig and Scott Sanders. Previews began on 12 March 2012 with the official opening on 5 April 2012. The production was nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical Revival. It closed on 26 January 2013 after 337 performances and 26 previews.\n\nThe first Italian production premiered in Sanremo (IM) 5 December 2013, directed by Susanna Tagliapietra, with Italian lyrics by Marco Savatteri. The original cast included Simona Angioloni as Eva Duarte, Edoardo Pallanca as Che, Agostino Marafioti as Juan Perón, Matteo Merli as Magaldi, Diletta Mangolini as Mistress, replaced by Simona Marrocco in the touring production.\n\nRegent's Park Open Air Theatre present the iconic musical (directed by Jamie Lloyd (director) from 2 August - 21 September 2019.\n\nThere have been numerous US and international touring productions of the show:\n\nThe 1980 1st US national tour opened at the Shubert Theatre in Los Angeles and starred Loni Ackerman as Eva, Scott Holmes as Che, Jon Cypher as Juan Perón, Sal Mistretta as Magaldi and Cynthia Hunt as Perón's Mistress. The 1982 2nd US national tour opened at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago and starred Valerie Perri as Eva, John Herrera as Che, Robert Alton as Juan Perón, Peter Marinos as Magaldi and Cynthia Simpson as Perón's Mistress. The 1983 3rd US National Tour opened at the Masonic Temple Theatre in Detroit and starred Florence Lacey as Eva, Tim Bowman as Che, John Leslie Wolfe as Juan Perón, Vincent Pirillo as Magaldi and Patricia Ludd as Perón's Mistress. In the 1984 and 1986 US tours, Florence Lacey played Eva.\n\nRebecca Storm played Eva with Chris Corcoran as Che.\n\nRebecca (Becky) Norman played Eva with James Sbano as Che and David Wasson as Perón with performances in Italy, Holland and Germany.\n\nFlorence Lacey starred once more with James Sbano as Che and Robert Alton as Perón.\n\nA touring production was mounted in anticipation of the film version which lasted over a year and featured several actresses in the title role, including future Tony nominee Marla Schaffel. It was directed and choreographed by Larry Fuller and featured Daniel C. Cooney as Che.\n\nPaul Nicholas and David Ian, with the original producers Robert Stigwood and David Land, mounted a version closely based on the original London production starring Marti Webb, one of the first performers to play Eva, with Chris Corcoran as Che, Duncan Smith as Perón, Leo Andrew as Magaldi and Poppy Tierney as the mistress. Despite some criticism over the casting of Webb at the age of 50, the success of the tour led to extensions throughout 1996.\n\nA tour, based on the original Broadway production, which was originally scheduled to play on Broadway in the 1999–2000 season started in Detroit on 3 November 1998 and closed in Boston, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1999. It starred Natalie Toro as Eva, with Raul Esparza as Che and Raymond Jaramillo McLeod as Juan Perón. This production focused more on Latin themes. According to Playbill, \"The Latin casting is part of an effort to instill this production with a more culturally authentic feel.\" Toro received excellent reviews, along with her leading men.\n\nA production opened in November 2004 with Kathy Voytko and Bradley Dean, directed by Harold Prince and Larry Fuller. This production closed in May 2007 but reopened later that year. It closed finally in June 2008.\n\nA tour, following the then recent London production, began in 2008 starring Louise Dearman and later Rachael Wooding as Eva, Seamus Cullen (a finalist in the BBC show \"Any Dream Will Do\") as Che, Mark Heenehan as Perón with James Waud as Magaldi who won the role in a competition, and Nikki Mae as Perón's Mistress, later Carly Bowmen. The UK tour ended in late 2009 but was remounted in March 2010, touring throughout Europe until April 2011. It continued in the UK and Germany from May to September 2011 featuring Abigail Jaye as Eva, Mark Powell as Che, Mark Heenehan as Perón and Reuben Kaye as Magaldi.\n\nA US national tour of the musical, based on the 2012 Broadway revival, began in September 2013. The cast for the tour included Caroline Bowman as Eva, Josh Young as Che, Sean McLaughlin as Perón, Christopher Johnstone as Magaldi, Krystina Alabado as Mistress and Desi Oakley as the alternate for Eva Perón.\n\nA tour, announced after the success of the Broadway production of the show, which was produced by Bill Kenwright. It opened on 15 May 2013 at the New Wimbledon Theatre, before dates at the Glasgow Kings Theatre, Theatre Royal Norwich, and the Wolverhampton Grand. The production starred Marti Pellow, the lead singer of the band Wet Wet Wet, as Che, Andrew C Wadsworth as Juan Perón, and Madalena Alberto as Eva Perón. The tour concluded with 55 performances at the Dominion Theatre on the West End in September and October 2014. This production was directed by Bob Thompson, with choreography by Bill Deamer, and musical direction by David Steadman.\n\nA replica of the 2013-2014 UK Tour began touring early 2017, once again in the UK. Led by Madalena Alberto, with Gian Marco Schiaretti as Che; Jeremy Secomb as Juan Peron; Oscar Balmaseda as Magaldi and Sarah O’Connor as the Mistress; this production ran through to July. In the same way the previous tour had a limited London run, this production will perform a limited, 91 performance run (due to the failure of \"The Girls\") at the Phoenix Theatre from July to October 2017. Hatton will reprise her role along with all her previous cast members. The tour will then continue into 2018.\n\nA revival of the original production (as directed by Hal Prince and choreographed by Larry Fuller) will tour South Africa, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Japan featuring a cast from South Africa and led by Emma Kingston from the U.K. in the title role.\n\nThe Singapore tour run from February 23, 2018 to March 18, 2018 in the Marina Bay Sands Theatre. 18 young talents were selected to be cast in this Evita production. Three sets of six children alternate in ensemble roles. The young actors are: Federica Aramburu, Lilo Baier, Mika Barel, Charmaine Chan, Hindya Dickinson, Jasmine Huilian Ellis, Gabriel Frade, Sam Howie, Annabelle Jarvis, Jayden Alim Lai, Lia Marie Elaine Macdonell, Max Makatsaria, Nanako Masui, Faith Ong, Sofia Ella Poston, Sebastian Street, Damien Rocco Weber, Charisse Low Yu Xin.\n\nA 2018 Australian revival of the stage musical, directed by Harold Prince, was announced on 21 August 2017, by Opera Australia, with Australian singer-songwriter, musician, musical theatre actress Tina Arena being confirmed as the lead actress. The stage tour production will begin at the Sydney Opera House, in the \"Joan Sutherland Theatre\", with opening night on September 13, running to November 3, 2018. The next venue on the national tour leg will be at the Arts Centre Melbourne, from December 5 to December 30, 2018. Arena says she felt the time was right to tackle the role. \"I have been approached to do this role on a couple of occasions,\" Arena stated. \"I never felt emotionally ready for it. I felt I had a lot of living and learning before I could get up and take on the enormity of the story and the human spirit she possessed\".\n\nOn May 7, 2018, Opera Australia Artistic Director Lyndon Terracini, along with producers John Frost and David Ian, announced the full cast for the upcoming Australian production of \"Evita\". With Arena announced in the lead role as Eva Perón, the remainder of the cast was announced as: Paulo Szot, Brazilian operatic baritone in the role of Juan Perón; Kurt Kansley will take on the role of the revolutionary Che Guevara. Michael Falzon will portray tango singer Agustín Magaldi, while the role of Perón’s Mistress will be played by Alexis van Maanen. Jemma Rix has been cast as the alternate Eva Perón and is currently scheduled to be appearing in the role at least once a week (the Wednesday 7:30pm show) throughout the Sydney season, according to the Evita-Australia website.\n\nOn July 21, 2018, Opera Australia Artistic Director Lyndon Terracini, along with producers John Frost and David Ian, announced the 18 young performers who have been cast in the upcoming production of \"Evita\", in season at the Sydney Opera House from September 2018. Three sets of six children will alternate in ensemble roles. The young actors are: Jack Barton, Alysiah Carlino, Julien Daher, Jacob Drew, Paige Hewlett, BeBe Liu-Brennan, Robbi Morgan, Allerah Murdock, William Oakley, Pamelia Papacosta, Benjamin Park, Sara Petrovski, Raffaella Reid, Avaleigh Rock, Amelie Rose, Austin Taylor, Oliver Trus, and Zoe Zantey.\n\nPlans for a film directed by Ken Russell developed soon after the West End and Broadway openings. Much speculation of potential leads included Barbra Streisand or Liza Minnelli as Eva, and Barry Gibb or Elton John as Che. These plans never came to fruition.\n\nRussell has said that his own first choice for the film lead was Karla DeVito, who had come to fame in rock tours and on Broadway, where she had impressed the wife of Andrew Lloyd Webber. DeVito was screen tested for the role while in England shooting music videos for her solo album \"Is This A Cool World or What?\" DeVito's performance of \"Don't Cry For Me, Argentina\" in the screen test caused much positive buzz. Russell wrote that she brought viewers to tears (except Tim Rice – who wanted Elaine Paige, with whom he was romantically involved). Although Russell rejected the idea, Paige was screen tested twice.\n\nRussell's biography indicates that he met with Barbra Streisand, who dismissed the role immediately. He wrote that he then suggested Liza Minnelli. A year had passed between the first screen tests and Minnelli's, which Russell reports was amazing. Russell approached Stigwood with Minnelli's test, convinced she had the necessary talent and star quality, but he was soon told it was going to be Elaine Paige. Having already protested that idea, Russell quit the film. Years later when he saw Karla DeVito again, Russell addressed her as \"My Evita.\"\n\nIt was not until 1996 that \"Evita\" came to the big screen. Alan Parker directed the film, with Madonna in the title role, Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Perón. Madonna had herself been interested in the role since 1986, and had lobbied hard for the role. The film was nominated for five Academy Awards, winning one for Best Original Song (\"You Must Love Me,\" composed especially for the film). Madonna received mixed reviews but received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her performance. The film was choreographed by Vincent Paterson.\n\n\"Evita\" came in sixth in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the UK's \"Number One Essential Musicals\".\n\nOne episode of \"The Simpsons\", \"The President Wore Pearls\", has a plot loosely based on the musical, with Lisa Simpson in Eva's role. The episode includes parodies of songs such as \"Don't Cry for Me, Kids of Springfield\". At the end of the episode, a comical disclaimer is displayed stating, \"On the advice of our lawyers, we swear we have never heard of a musical based on the life of Eva Perón\".\n\nDuring \"Glee\", \"Special Education\", the characters Kurt Hummel and Rachel Berry sing \"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\" when Kurt is auditioning for a solo in the Warblers for Sectionals. In the season three episode \"Hold On to Sixteen\", a rival showchoir sings \"Buenos Aires\" as their competition piece.\n\nIn the short \"The Ballad of Magellan\" in the cartoon series Animaniacs, the country of Argentina is depicted with a sign reading, \"EVITA Coming Soon!\".\n\nFirst recorded by a cast assembled specifically for the recording in 1976, the first stage cast recording of Evita was of the original London production in 1978. The original Broadway cast was recorded for an album released in 1979. Lloyd Webber and Rice produced these first three recordings.\n\nAt least 25 English language cast albums have been released, along with many foreign language recordings. There are currently four in Spanish, five German, three in Japanese, and two in Hebrew, with additional recordings in Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, Hungarian, Icelandic, Korean, Portuguese, and Swedish.\n\nSoprano Kiri Te Kanawa recorded a complete operatic version of the score with Christopher Lee as Perón. This recording, however, has never been released. Marti Webb also recorded a highlights album of sorts for the Pickwick Records label that featured Dave Willetts and Carl Wayne. It was released to coincide with the 1995 UK Tour of the show in which Webb starred.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11384933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11384933", "title": "Extinction threshold", "text": "Extinction threshold\n\nExtinction threshold is a term used in conservation biology to explain the point at which a species, population or metapopulation, experiences an abrupt change in density or number because of an important parameter, such as habitat loss. It is at this critical value below which a species, population, or metapopulation, will go extinct, though this may take a long time for species just below the critical value, a phenomenon known as extinction debt.\n\nExtinction thresholds are important to conservation biologists when studying a species in a population or metapopulation context because the colonization rate must be larger than the extinction rate, otherwise the entire entity will go extinct once it reaches the threshold.\n\nExtinction thresholds are realized under a number of circumstances and the point in modeling them is to define the conditions that lead a population to extinction. Modeling extinction thresholds can explain the relationship between extinction threshold and habitat loss and habitat fragmentation.\n\nMetapopulation-type models are used to predict extinction thresholds. The classic metapopulation model is the Levins Model, which is the model of metapopulation dynamics established by Richard Levins in the 1960s. It was used to evaluate patch occupancy in a large network of patches. This model was extended in the 1980s by Russell Lande to include habitat occupancy. This mathematical model is used to infer the extinction values and important population densities. These mathematical models are primarily used to study extinction thresholds because of the difficulty in understanding extinction processes through empirical methods and the current lack of research on this subject. When determining an extinction threshold there are two types of models that can be used: deterministic and stochastic metapopulation models.\n\nDeterministic metapopulation models assume that there are an infinite number of habitat patches available and predict that the metapopulation will go extinct only if the threshold is not met.\n\ndp/dt = chp (1-p)-ep\n\nWhere p= occupied patches, e= extinction rate, c= colonization rate, and h= amount of habitat.\n\nA species will persist only if h> δ \n\nwhere δ=e/c \n\nδ= species parameter, or how successful a species is in colonizing a patch.\n\nStochastic metapopulation models take into account stochasticity, which is the non-deterministic or random processes in nature. With this approach a metapopulation may be above the threshold if determined that it is unlikely it will go extinct within a certain time period. \n\nThe complex nature of these models can result in a small metapopulation that is considered to be above the deterministic extinction threshold, but in reality has a high risk of extinction .\n\nWhen using metapopulation-type models to predict extinction thresholds there are a number of factors that can affect the results of a model. First, including more complicated models, rather than relying solely on the Levins model produces different dynamics. For example, in an article published in 2004, Otso Ovaskainen and Ilkka Hanski explained with an empirical example that when factors such as Allee effect or Rescue effect were included in modeling the extinction threshold, there were unexpected extinctions in a high number of species. A more complex model came up with different results, and in practicing conservation biology this can add more confusion to efforts to save a species from the extinction threshold. Transient dynamics, which are effects on the extinction threshold because of instability in either the metapopulation or environmental conditions, is also a large player in modeling results. Landscapes that have recently endured habitat loss and fragmentation may be less able to sustain a metapopulation than previously understood without considering transient dynamics. Finally, environmental stochasticity, which may be spatially correlated, can lead to amplified regional stochastic fluctuations and therefore greatly affect the extinction risk.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4472917", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4472917", "title": "Fritz Honka", "text": "Fritz Honka\n\nFriedrich Paul 'Fritz' Honka (31 July 1935 – 19 October 1998) was a German serial killer. Between 1970 and 1975 he killed at least four prostitutes from Hamburg's red light district, keeping the bodies in his flat.\n\nHonka was born on 31 July 1935 in Leipzig as the third of ten children. His father Fritz Honka (Senior) was a joiner, his mother Else Honka worked as a cleaner. Three of his siblings died during birth. During his later trial Honka described his youth thus: \"My father was in a concentration camp. I too was in a concentration camp for children. I was freed by the Russians. My father too. School afterwards didn't amount to much.\" Honka grew up in children's homes in Leipzig. His father worked as a stoker in Leipzig. His father was said to have been sent to a concentration camp for working for the Communists. He died in 1946 of alcoholism and long-term health issues caused by imprisonment.\n\nHis mother was said to be unable to cope with her nine children. In the early 1950s, Honka started an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, but had to give it up due to an allergy. Honka fled to West Germany in 1951 and started work as an unskilled farm worker in the small village of Brockhöfe on the Lüneburg Heath. He had an affair with a woman named Margot which yielded a son, Heinrich. Honka had to pay 3000 Deutschmarks alimony and left the village. In 1956 he came to Hamburg and was employed as a harbour worker at Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft. A serious traffic accident in 1956 smashed his nose and gave him a pronounced squint. In 1957 he married Inge and had a son called Fritz, but the marriage failed and they separated in 1960. Neighbours recall violent scenes in their flat. The couple reconciled, but separated a second time in 1967. He moved to the Hamburg suburb of Ottensen in 1967. In 1972 he lived together with Irmgard Albrecht for a while. On 15 August 1972 he attempted to force Ruth Dufner to have sex with him and Irmgard. Dufner fled unclothed from Honka's flat and reported him to the police. She received treatment in hospital. At the time of the incident, Honka had a very high blood alcohol level. On 4 April 1975 a court ordered him to pay a fine of 4500 DM, but a charge of rape was dropped. In the years afterwards, his problems with alcohol prevented him from maintaining relationships with women, and he turned to prostitutes he met in pubs or around the Reeperbahn for sex.\n\nIn December 1970 Honka, then a night watchman for Shell, committed his first proven murder. He strangled Gertraud Bräuer, a 42-year-old hairdresser and occasional prostitute, in his flat. Honka said that she would not have sex with him. Honka sawed the corpse into pieces that he then wrapped up and hid in various places in the nearby area. The body parts were found and identified by Hamburg police, but their investigation did not find the murderer.\n\nHonka murdered again, four years later, when he strangled the 54-year-old prostitute Anna Beuschel in his flat in August 1974. He claimed that she had not been passionate enough when they had sex. In December 1974 he killed the 57-year-old Frieda Roblick in the same way and in January 1975 he murdered the 52-year-old prostitute Ruth Schult. In all three cases Honka cut the corpses into small pieces and hid them in his flat and in the house's attic. The disappearance of the three women was not reported to the police. Complaints of other people living in the house regarding the stench of rotting flesh were disregarded. Honka used large numbers of pine-scented perfume blocks in an attempt to mask the odour.\n\nFritz Honka was short () and of slight build. He had a squint and a speech impediment. Both of his marriages failed due to heavy alcohol consumption. When very drunk he would vent his aggression on women, usually shorter than him and often toothless, to alleviate his fears of mutilation during oral sex.\n\nOn 15 July 1975 the apartment building where Honka lived caught fire. Firemen tackling the blaze discovered a partially decomposed female torso in a plastic bag which prompted the police to search the flat. Honka was at work at the time and was arrested when he returned home. On 29 July Fritz Honka confessed to murdering the women. He withdrew his confession in November 1976 claiming not to remember anything.\n\nIn custody, Honka said he killed the women after they mocked his preference for oral sex over \"straight\" intercourse. The court found him guilty on one count of murder and three counts of manslaughter. He was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment in a psychiatric hospital. His habitual abuse of alcohol was considered a mitigating factor, as it diminished his mental capacity.\n\nHonka was released from prison in 1993 and spent his last years in a nursing home under the name of Peter Jensen. He died in a hospital in Langenhorn, Hamburg on 19 October 1998.\n\nIn 1975, German musician Karl-Heinz Blumenberg recorded the black humor single \"Gern hab ich die Frau'n gesägt\" (\"I loved to saw the women\", a titular reference to the 1920s Schlager \"Gern hab ich die Frau'n geküßt\", \"I loved to kiss the women\", sung by Richard Tauber) under the pseudonym of Harry Horror, in reference to Honka. The song quickly became an underground hit in Hamburg clubs, but Blumenberg's record company RCA Records refused to officially release it due to its controversial theme.\n\nGerman writer Heinz Strunk's novel \"Der goldene Handschuh\" (The Golden Glove) was published in 2016, winning the Wilhelm Raabe Literature Prize and nominated for the Leipzig Book Fair Prize. It tells the story of Fritz Honka and bears the name of one of the St Pauli bars in which Honka met his victims.\n"}
{"id": "46685471", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46685471", "title": "Great Stockholm Fire of 1759", "text": "Great Stockholm Fire of 1759\n\nThe Great Stockholm Fire of 1759 was the city’s greatest fire since 1686. It raged in the Eastern Södermalm on Thursday July 19 and over the following night, reduced about 20 blocks with about 300 houses to ash, and rendered about 2000 persons homeless. While no deaths were reported, there were 19 injuries. In Sweden, the fire is named \"Mariabranden\" (Swedish \"brand\" = fire) after the Maria Magdalena Church, which was severely damaged. Outside Sweden, the fire is most famous because an occult anecdote claims the scientist and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg by a sort of clairvoyance could ”see” the fire from Gothenburg.\n\nIn the 18th century, fire was a serious threat to urban centers. In Northern Europe, most houses were made of wood, and were often built very close to adjoining structures. Open fires were used for cooking, heating, and light. When a fire broke out, firefighting mainly depended on bucket or pail teams, in addition to fire axes and equipment to tear downs houses for firebreaks. Like most major cities, Stockholm did not have any professional firefighters at the time. As cities expanded in the 17th and 18th centuries, fires became more threatening, as with the Great Fire of London, the Great Fire of Copenhagen in 1728, and the Great Fire of Bergen in 1702.\n\nThe increased fire threat also applied to Sweden. Throughout the 17th century, Sweden had experienced over 30 devastating fires which had destroyed many cities and villages. In addition, the Russians had burned down more than 20 cities or towns between 1714 and 1721, during the Great Northern War. In 1751, the year before Karlstad burned for the third time since 1616, a violent fire (\"Klarabranden\") had destroyed at least a hundred buildings in Stockholm. The fire had originated in Norrmalm during a whole gale and grew into a firestorm. Some copper plates, glowing with heat from the fire, blew above Riddarfjärden (an arm of the sea Mälaren), at least 400 meters, and, in turn, set fire to buildings on Södermalm, as well.\n\nIn 1759, a severe drought struck Stockholm. As both buildings and vegetation dried out, the fire hazard grew. In addition, the water supply was on the verge of running dry, (except near Mälaren.) which meant that any fire would be harder to fight. The drought may also have contributed to fires in the towns of Skövde and (in south-eastern Norway) Halden the same year.\n\nAt around 16:15 on July 19, the fire broke out in the Besvärsbackan (literally: \"Trouble Hill\") area. High (and increasing) winds spread the fire quickly in all directions, but especially to the west and southwest. About an hour and a half later, the Maria Magdalena Church caught fire. Panic spreading among the people made the situation worse. Attempts to fight the fire were hampered by a lack of available water, and the lines bringing water from Mälaren (one of the few bodies of water not shrunk by the drought) grew longer as the fire advanced away from the sea.\n\nGiven the inferior equipment available at the time and the difficulties in transporting water, it was probably not possible the extinguish the fire itself. As the fire crossed the major street (Hornsgatan) in the area, firefighting efforts turned towards the construction of firebreaks well in advance of the fire's spread. Using some open areas on either side of Hornsgatan, the firebreaks were able to halt the fire's advance, and it burned itself out early on the morning of July 20 (Friday).\n\nThe Maria Magdalena Church was severely damaged. The tower had collapsed, and the interior was burned out. However, the people demanded that the church should be restored. It was reopened four years later, at the Pentecost of 1763. The church tower was rebuilt in 1825.\nAfter the fire, the city government required all constructions to consist of brick and stone. With these regulations in place, the Great Fire of 1759 was the last on such a scale to strike Stockholm.\n\nOutside Sweden, the fire is most famous because of a story connected to the scientist and mystic Emanuel Swedenborg (1688-1772). According to an anecdote, Swedenborg could ”see” the fire during a dinner in Gothenburg with his friend William Castel. At that time, Swedenborg himself lived at Hornsgatan 43 in Stockholm. Supposedly, Swedenborg declared later in the evening that the fire was stopped three buildings from his own – as it indeed was. Swedenborg’s biographer Lars Bergquist, however, writes the dinner in question took place on Sunday July 29, ten days after the fire broke out. Because a courier at that time could travel from Stockholm to Gothenburg at about two days or a little more, Swedenborg could have got information about the fire without the use of any \"paranormal\" abilities.\n\n"}

{"id": "52653706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52653706", "title": "ISS-RapidScat", "text": "ISS-RapidScat\n\nISS-RapidScat was an instrument mounted to the International Space Station \"Columbus\" module that measured wind speeds. It was launched aboard SpaceX CRS-4 in September 2014 and operated until August 2016. ISS-RapidScat was a scatterometer designed to support weather forecasting by bouncing microwaves off the ocean's surface to measure wind speed. It featured a rotating radar dish that operated at 13.4 GHz (K band). It could collect data between 51.6 degrees north and south latitude, with a swath .\n\nThe ISS-RapidScat program was initiated in response to the failure of the QuikSCAT satellite's antenna rotation mechanism in November 2009. While the spacecraft continued to function, it could only gather data in one direction, significantly limiting its data collection ability. ISS-RapidScat was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory from elements of QuikSCAT's SeaWinds instrument engineering model, originally used to validate that instrument's flight hardware prior to its launch in 1999. It was constructed in 18 months; re-using the QuikScat hardware had the double benefit of reducing cost and using already flight-proven hardware that functioned well in orbit.\n\nISS-RapidScat was very similar to QuikSCAT in functionality. However, the instrument suffered due to peculiarities of the International Space Station, such as the station's varying altitude due to increased drag, its variable orientation due to the demands of visiting spacecraft, and its lack of a Sun-synchronous orbit. By the time of ISS-RapidScat's launch, the European Space Agency MetOp series were the only two satellites with fully functioning scatterometers in orbit. Some of these peculiarities were also advantages. Its mid-latitude orbit meant it was able to collect data about the same spot on Earth at different times of day, whereas the Sun-synchronous orbits used by other scatterometer-equipped spacecraft would re-visit the same location on Earth at the same time daily. This allowed scientists to study how the wind changes at one location over the course of a day. This orbit also gives better coverage of the tropics, and by crossing the orbit of other satellites, it was able to observe the same area at the same time as them, allowing for cross-calibration between the different data sets.\n\nObjectives of the ISS-RapidScat program were to mitigate the loss of and provide continuity of wind data products from the QuikSCAT SeaWinds instrument, serve as a calibration standard for the international constellation of scatterometer-equipped satellites, and to sample the diurnal and semi-diurnal wind variations that occur between ISS flight latitudes at least every two months.\n\nThe scatterometer was launched as external cargo aboard the SpaceX CRS-4 mission on 21 September 2014, attached to the unpressurized section of the Dragon capsule. Dragon was berthed to the station on 23 September. The instrument was removed from Dragon, robotically assembled and attached to \"Columbus\" between 29 and 30 September. It was powered up on 1 October and immediately began gathering data, which was first processed into an uncalibrated product on 3 October. ISS-RapidScat was declared fully operational and its data products properly calibrated on 10 November.\n\nOne of ISS-RapidScat's first observations was of Tropical Storm Simon off the coast of the Baja California Peninsula on 3 October 2014. It also played a role in observing the Category 5 Hurricane Patricia in October 2015, which was noted as one of the most powerful hurricanes on record, with maximum sustained winds of . Data from ISS-RapidScat was disseminated worldwide for use in weather forecasting, and was used by the United States Navy, NOAA, and EUMETSAT, among others.\n\nOn 19 August 2016, the \"Columbus\" module, to which ISS-RapidScat was attached and reliant on for resources, suffered a power distribution unit failure, which resulted in ISS-RapidScat shutting down. This was followed by an electrical overload in the power distribution unit during recovery efforts. Attempts to restore the instrument were without success, and NASA formally terminated operations on 28 November 2016. No replacement or successor device was planned.\n\nISS-RapidScat was removed from the \"Columbus\" module on 1 January 2018 and stowed inside the SpaceX CRS-13 Dragon trunk. On 13 January 2018, the trunk section and ISS-RapidScat re-entered Earth's atmosphere and were destroyed as planned, while the Dragon capsule and its cargo landed in the Pacific Ocean and were recovered.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "174095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174095", "title": "Indecent exposure", "text": "Indecent exposure\n\nIndecent exposure is the deliberate exposure in public or in view of the general public by a person of a portion or portions of their body, in circumstances where the exposure is contrary to local moral or other standards of appropriate behavior. The term \"indecent exposure\" is a legal expression. Social and community attitudes to the exposing of various body parts and laws covering what is referred to as indecent exposure vary significantly in different countries. It ranges from outright prohibition to prohibition of exposure of certain body parts, such as the genital area, buttocks or breasts.\n\nDecency is generally judged by the standards of the local community, which are seldom codified in specifics in law. Such standards may be based on religion, morality or tradition, or justified on the basis of \"necessary to public order\". Non-sexual exhibitionism or public nudity is sometimes considered indecent exposure. If sexual acts are performed, with or without an element of nudity, this can be considered gross indecency, which is usually a more serious criminal offence. In some countries, exposure of the body in breach of community standards of modesty is also considered to be public indecency.\n\nThe legal and community standards of what states of undress constitute indecent exposure vary considerably and depend on the context in which the exposure takes place. These standards have also varied over time, making the definition of indecent exposure itself a complex topic.\n\nIt is generally accepted, at least in western countries, that a naked human body is not in itself indecent. That principle is reflected, for example, in depiction of the human form in art of various forms. Nevertheless, as a general rule, it is also commonly expected that people when they appear in a public place will be appropriately attired. Inappropriateness is viewed in context, so that, for example, what may be appropriate on a beach may be inappropriate in a street, school or workplace. Depending on the context, some degree of inappropriateness may be tolerated, and perhaps described as eccentric, but in extreme cases of inappropriateness it may be regarded as \"crossing the line\". Besides the social disapproval of such a state of dress, most jurisdictions have laws to \"maintain social order\", variously described as public nudity, indecent exposure, as an affront to public morality, public nuisance, besides others. What is an inappropriate state of dress in a particular context depends on the standards of decency of the community where an exposure takes place. These standards vary from time to time and can vary from the very strict standards of modesty in places such as Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, which require most of the body to be covered, to tribal societies such as the Pirahã or Mursi where full nakedness is the norm. There is generally no implication that the state of dress objected to is of a sexual nature; and if such an allegation were to be made, the act would generally be described as \"gross indecency\".\n\nThe standards of decency have varied over time. During the Victorian era, for example, exposure of a woman's legs and some extent the arms, was considered indecent in much of the Western world. Hair was sometimes required to be covered in formal occasions as in a form a hat or bonnet. As late as the 1930s and to some extent, the 1950s, both women and men were expected to bathe or swim in public places wearing bathing suits that covered above the waist. An adult woman exposing her navel was also considered indecent in the West into the 1960s and 1970s, and even as late as the 1980s. Moral values changed drastically during the 1990s and 2000s, which in turn changed the criteria for indecent exposure. Public exposure of the navel has been accepted during the 1990s, such as in beaches, while in the 2000s, the buttocks can be exposed while wearing a thong. Today, however, it is quite common for women to go topless at public beaches throughout Europe and South America and even some parts of the United States.\n\nAlthough the phenomenon widely known as flashing, involving a woman exposing bare nipples by suddenly pulling up her shirt and bra, may be free from sexual motive or intent, it nonetheless is public exposure and is therefore defined by statute in many states of the United States as prohibited criminal behavior.\n\nThe motivation of the exposure is sometimes based on it being unusual, attention-getting, sexually arousing, or separately, as in a public policy protest, inappropriate and to show disrespect to the enemy side. The effects (including negative consequences) may be enhanced by intended or unintended publication of a photograph or film of the act, which would also include mooning.\n\nBreastfeeding in public does not constitute indecent exposure under the laws of the United States, Canada, Australia, or Scotland. In the United States, the federal government and all 50 states have enacted laws specifically protecting nursing mothers from harassment by others. Legislation ranges from simply exempting breastfeeding from laws regarding indecent exposure, to outright full protection of the right to nurse.\n\nPublic clothing varies by country and may be regulated by law. What parts of the body must be covered varies by region. Although genitals are usually expected to be covered in public in almost all societies, when it comes to other parts of the body such as female breasts, midriff, legs or shoulders, norms vary. For example, in some African cultures, it is the thighs, not the breasts, which must be covered. In some societies, the head hair, especially female, must be covered, usually with a scarf. The vast majority of cultures accept that the face can and must be seen, but some cultures (especially in the Middle East), require that it be covered under a burqa. In conservative societies, appearing in a public place in clothing that is deemed 'indecent' is illegal. In many countries there are exceptions to the general rules (social or legal) regarding clothing. For instance, a country which generally prohibits full nudity may allow it in designated places, such as nude beaches, or during various social events such as festivals or nude protests.\n\nAttitudes towards nudity vary by country and are generally most relaxed in Scandinavia, \nwhere genitals and breasts are not normally considered indecent or obscene. Hence, laws and societal views on public nudity are generally relaxed. In Finland, it is very typical for patrons to bathe nude in the intense heat of saunas. \n\nIn the Netherlands, public nudity is allowed at sites that have been assigned by the local authorities and \"other suitable places.\" On nudist beaches, in unisex saunas and in swimming pool changing rooms, remaining partially clothed is frowned upon and the social norm is to undress. \n\nIn Barcelona, public nudity was a recognised right. However, on 30 April 2011, the Barcelona City Council voted a by-law forbidding walking \"naked or nearly naked in public spaces\" and limiting the wearing of bathing costumes to pools, beaches, adjacent streets and sea-side walks.\n\nOther countries, such as the UK, Ireland or Poland are more conservative. \n\nIn the United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries, indecent exposure was prosecuted under either section 28 of the Town Police Clauses Act 1847 or section 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824. The latter was a piece of legislation that made it an offence to sleep rough or beg and contained a provision for the prosecution of:\nThis provision was repealed by section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which replaced the offence of \"indecent exposure\" and other sexual offences with legislation that is more specific and explicit. Current laws apply only to genital exposure with intent to shock those who do not want to see them. The maximum penalty is two years' imprisonment, but this is extremely rare as most cases are dealt with by a fine or through community service. People convicted of exposure contrary to section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 must sign the Violent and Sex Offender Register if they are sentenced to a term of imprisonment or a community order in excess of 12 months, or if the person they exposed themselves to was aged under 18.\n\nPublic nudity in England and Wales can also be punished as \"disorderly behaviour\" under the Public Order Act 1986, sections 4A and 5.\n\nIn Scotland and Northern Ireland the situation is more complex, as some sections of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 extend to these places and some do not. Under Scots law, indecent exposure is considered to be a form of public indecency and is regarded as a crime of indecency. Scots law has been known to respond differently from English and Welsh law in cases of indecent exposure. Stephen Gough, a man known as the \"Naked Rambler\" who hikes across Britain wearing only shoes, has been arrested in both jurisdictions with different consequences in each. The Northern Ireland Assembly has considered the introduction of new legislation.\n\nThe laws governing indecent exposure in the United States vary according to location. In most states public nudity is illegal. However, in some states it is only illegal if it is accompanied by an intent to shock, arouse or offend other persons. Some states permit local governments to set local standards. Most states exempt breastfeeding mothers from prosecution.\n\nIn Canada, s.173 of the \"Criminal Code\" prohibits \"indecent acts\". There is no statutory definition in the Code of what constitutes an indecent act, other than the exposure of the genitals and/or female nipples for a sexual purpose to anyone under 16 years of age. Thus, the decision of what states of undress are \"indecent\", and thereby unlawful, is left to judges. Judges have held, for example, that nude sunbathing is not indecent. Also, streaking is similarly not regarded as indecent. Section 174 prohibits nudity if it offends \"against public decency or order\" and in view of the public. The courts have found that nude swimming is not offensive under this definition.\n\nToplessness is also not an indecent act under s.173. In 1991, Gwen Jacob was arrested for walking in a street in Guelph, Ontario while topless. She was acquitted in 1996 by the Ontario Court of Appeal on the basis that the act of being topless is not in itself a sexual act or indecent. The case has been referred to in subsequent cases for the proposition that the mere act of public nudity is not sexual or indecent or an offense. Since then it is legal for a female to walk topless in public anywhere in Ontario, Canada.\n\nIn Australia, it is a summary or criminal offence in some States and Territories to expose one's genitals (also referred to as - 'his or her person') in a public place or in view of a public place. In some jurisdictions exposure of the genitals alone does not constitute an offence unless accompanied by an indecent act, indecent behaviour, grossly indecent behaviour, obscenity, intention to cause offence or deliberate intention. The applicable law is different in each jurisdiction and in several jurisdictions the offence of indecent exposure does not apply.\n\nPenalties vary between jurisdictions and are summarised below. Specific state Acts, are as follows:\n\nThe laws of New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory use the term \"person\", while in the other States the exposure refers to the genital area. It has been noted that a term such as \"exposing one's person\" relates back to the United Kingdom \"Vagrancy Act\" 1824 and \"Evans v Ewels\" (1972) where it was said that the word \"person\" was a genteel synonym for \"penis\" or \"vulva\". However, it has been held that the word \"person\" in s5 of the (NSW) \"Summary Offences Act\" is not limited to \"penis\" or \"vulva\". For example, in \"R v Eyles\" (1997) the offender was seen masturbating in his front garden and charged with obscene exposure under the NSW Act.\n\nHowever –\n\nThe Indian Penal Code (IPC) is often used to charge sex workers with vague crimes such as \"public indecency\" or being a \"public nuisance\" without explicitly defining what these consist of.\n\nWomen in Saudi Arabia are legally required to wear robes and a headscarf when in public.\n"}
{"id": "15114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15114", "title": "Indictable offence", "text": "Indictable offence\n\nIn many common law jurisdictions (e.g., England and Wales, Ireland, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore), an indictable offence is an offence which can only be tried on an indictment after a preliminary hearing to determine whether there is a \"prima facie\" case to answer or by a grand jury (in contrast to a summary offence). In the United States, a crime of similar severity and rules is called a felony, which also requires an indictment.\n\nIn relation to England and Wales, the expression \"indictable offence\" means an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable on indictment, whether it is exclusively so triable or triable either way; and the term \"indictable\", in its application to offences, is to be construed accordingly. In this definition, references to the way or ways in which an offence is triable are to be construed without regard to the effect, if any, of section 22 of the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980 on the mode of trial in a particular case.\n\nAn either-way offence allows the defendant to elect between trial by jury on indictment in the Crown Court and summary trial in a magistrates' court. However, the election may be overruled by the magistrates' court if the facts suggest that the sentencing powers of a magistrates' court would be inadequate to reflect the seriousness of the offence. \n\nIn relation to some indictable offences, for example criminal damage, only summary trial is available unless the damage caused exceeds £5,000. \n\nA youth court has jurisdiction to try all indictable offences with the exception of homicide and certain firearms offences, and will normally do so provided that the available sentencing power of two years' detention is adequate to punish the offender if found guilty.\n\nSee section 64 of the Criminal Law Act 1977. \n\nGrand juries were abolished in 1933.\n\nSome offences such as murder and rape are considered so serious that they can only be tried on indictment at the Crown Court where the widest range of sentencing powers is available to the judge.\n\nThe expression \"indictable-only offence\" was defined by section 51 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, as originally enacted, as an offence triable only on indictment. Sections 51 and 52 of, and Schedule 3 to, that Act abolished committal proceedings for such offences and made other provisions in relation to them.\n\nWhen the accused is charged with an indictable-only offence, he or she will be tried in the Crown Court. The rules are different in England and Wales in respect of those under 18 years of age.\n\nSee also section 14(a) of the Criminal Law Act 1977.\n\nSimilarly in New Zealand, a rape or murder charge will be tried at the High Court, while less serious offences such as theft, will be tried at the District Court. However, the District Court can hold both jury and summary trials.\n\nFor differences between indictable offences and summary offences see summary offences.\n\nIn United States penal law, other than a felony, court findings of, or an act of gross negligence can be counted as an indictable offence.\n\n"}

Little is known about their ethnicity, it has been speculated that they might have been Persians or Armenians, yet other sources claim them to have been native to the Levant or possibly even from the Arabian peninsula. Their other Arabic name, \"al-Jarājimah\", suggests that some were natives of the town Jurjum in Cilicia, however the name also exists in Arabic and translates to \"Sick\" or \"Insane\" as is the case with the word \"Mareed\", due to their fierce fighting style and retaliation against attacks. They were joined later by various escaped slaves and peasants during their insurgency and were said to have claimed territory from \"the Holy City\" to the \"Black Mountain\".\n\nAccording to some historians, after the Muslim conquest of the Levant, the Mardaites gained a semi-independent status around the Nur Mountains within al-ʿAwāṣim, the Byzantine-Arab border region. They initially agreed to serve as mercenaries for the Arabs and to guard the Amanian Gate, but their loyalty was intermittent and they often sided with the Byzantine Empire as their agenda varied.\n\nAccording to Greek and Syriac historians, their territory stretched from the Amanus to the \"holy city\", the latter often identified as Jerusalem, although more likely to refer to Cyrrhus, also called Hagioupolis, the capital of Cyrrhestica, in upper Syria.\n\nTheir numbers were swelled by thousands of runaway slaves, making them an ethnically diverse group. In light of this, it is claimed that they forced Muawiyah I, Caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, to pay tribute to the Byzantine emperor Constantine IV, or possibly to them instead. Emperor Justinian II sent the Mardaites again to raid Syria in 688/9; this time they were joined by native peasants and slaves and were able to advance as far as Lebanon. The Umayyads were compelled to sign another treaty by which they paid the Byzantines half the tribute of Cyprus, Armenia and the Kingdom of Iberia in the Caucasus Mountains; in return, Justinian relocated around 12,000 Mardaites to the southern coast of Anatolia, as well as parts of Greece such as Epirus and the Peloponnese, as part of his measures to restore population and manpower to areas depleted by earlier conflicts. There they were conscripted as rowers and marines in the Byzantine navy for several centuries. Others however remained behind and continued raiding Muslim-held territories until their chief stronghold fell to Umayyad prince-general Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik in 708. Maslama(h) then resettled them throughout Syria, and although he allowed them to retain their faith, he conscripted them into his army.\n\nDescribing the abna' of Yemen, Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani states in his \"Kitab al-Aghani\" that, up to his time (10th century), these people were called \"\"banū al-aḥrār\" () in Sanaa, \"al-abnāʾ\" in Yemen, \"al-aḥāmira\" () in Kufa, \"al-asāwira\" () in Basra, \"al-khaḍārima\" () in al-Jazira, and \"al-jarājima\" () in Bilad al-Sham\".\n\nMany Maronites claim that the modern Maronites are of Mardaite ancestry, and oral tradition is said to indicate this. However, documented evidence is sporadic at best as the Maronites sources are recent due to their lack of a thorough recorded history beyond the 16th century, leaving the matter open for debate among historians. That being said, Maronite oral tradition does mirror much of the history of the Mardaites and it is possible that the similarities are superficial and the groups are similar, but unrelated. In reality there is no way to prove or disprove this connection due to the lack of a thorough recorded history, but oral traditions are unlikely to have been falsified in isolated mountain communities. Many attribute the view that the Maronites are unrelated to the Mardaites due to early historic bias, when the West favored the Druze until the pogroms of Syria in the 19th century which resulted in the death of 50,000 Maronites and other Christians at the hands of the Druze as a reprisal for Maronite peasantry and Maronite church attempts to topple their feudal lords in the South of Mount Lebanon.\n\nThis term was adopted by the Marada Movement during the Lebanese Civil War because of their Phoenicianist views of the origin of the Lebanese people.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55551931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55551931", "title": "Me Too movement", "text": "Me Too movement\n\nThe Me Too movement (or #MeToo movement), with many local and international alternative names, is a movement against sexual harassment and sexual assault. #MeToo spread virally in October 2017 as a hashtag on social media in an attempt to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace. It followed soon after the sexual abuse allegations against Harvey Weinstein. Tarana Burke, an American social activist and community organizer, began using the phrase \"Me Too\" as early as 2006, and the phrase was later popularized by American actress Alyssa Milano, on Twitter in 2017. Milano and Michael Baker encouraged victims of sexual harassment to tweet about it and \"give people a sense of the magnitude of the problem\". This was met with success that included but was not limited to high-profile posts from several American celebrities, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Ashley Judd, Jennifer Lawrence, and Uma Thurman.\n\nSeveral hashtags about sharing stories of workforce sexual harassment were in use before #MeToo, including #MyHarveyWeinstein, #YouOkSis, #WhatWereYouWearing and #SurvivorPrivilege.\n\nTarana Burke, a social activist and community organizer, began using the phrase \"Me Too\" in 2006, on the Myspace social network as part of a campaign to promote \"empowerment through empathy\" among women of color who have experienced sexual abuse, particularly within underprivileged communities. Burke, who is creating a documentary titled \"Me Too\", has said she was inspired to use the phrase after being unable to respond to a 13-year-old girl who confided to her that she had been sexually assaulted. Burke later wished she had simply told the girl, \"me too\".\n\nOn October 15, 2017, actress Alyssa Milano encouraged spreading the hashtag #MeToo, to attempt to draw attention to sexual assault and harassment. Milano later acknowledged earlier use of the phrase by Burke.\n\nThe phrase \"Me too\" was tweeted by Milano around noon on October 15, 2017, and had been used more than 200,000 times by the end of the day, and tweeted more than 500,000 times by October 16. On Facebook, the hashtag was used by more than 4.7 million people in 12 million posts during the first 24 hours. The platform reported that 45% of users in the United States had a friend who had posted using the term.\n\nTens of thousands of people, including hundreds of celebrities, replied with #MeToo stories. Some men, such as actors Terry Crews and James Van Der Beek, have responded to the hashtag with their own experiences of harassment and abuse, while others have responded by acknowledging past behaviors against women, spawning the hashtag #HowIWillChange.\n\nIn addition to Hollywood, \"Me Too\" declarations elicited discussion of sexual harassment and abuse in the music industry, sciences, academia, and politics.\n\nFeminist author Gloria Feldt stated in \"Time\" that many employers are being forced to make changes in response to #MeToo, for example examining gender-based pay differences and improving sexual harassment policies. Others have noted there has been pressure on companies, specifically in the financial industry, to disclose diversity statistics.\n\nIn November 2017, the hashtag #ChurchToo was started by Emily Joy and Hannah Paasch on Twitter and began trending in response to #MeToo as a way to try to highlight and stop sexual abuse that happens in a church. In early January 2018, about a hundred evangelical women also launched #SilenceIsNotSpiritual to call for changes to how sexual misconduct is dealt within the church. #ChurchToo started spreading again virally later in January 2018 in response to a live-streamed video admission by Pastor Andy Savage to his church that he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old girl twenty years before as a youth pastor while driving her home, but then received applause by his church for admitting to the incident and asking for forgiveness. Pastor Andy Savage then resigned from his staff position at Highpoint Church and stepped away from ministry. Many have argued that one of the biggest crises in the history of the Catholic Church is the current child sexual abuse that is being reported, according to Tom Inglis in his book \"Are the Irish Different?\". \n\nThe University of California has been no stranger to sexual harassment, with substantial accusations reported yearly in the hundreds at all nine UC campuses, notably UC Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, and San Diego. However, a landmark event at the University of California, Irvine spearheaded the removal and reprimanding of several campus officials and professors accused of sexual harassment and discrimination. In early July 2018, UC Irvine removed millionaire benefactor Francisco J. Ayala's name from its biology school, central science library, graduate fellowships, scholar programs, and endowed chairs after an internal investigation substantiated a number of sexual harassment claims. The results from the investigation were compiled in a 97-page report, which included testimony from victims enduing Ayala's harassment for 15 years. His removal promptly sparked the removal of Professor Ron Carlson in August 2018, who had led the creative writing program at UC Irvine. He resigned after substantiated reports of sexual misconduct with an underage student became unearthed. UC Irvine upon learning about the report accepted Professor Carlson’s immediate resignation. Additionally, four additional professors in the School of Biological Sciences at UC Irvine between June and August 2018 were put under sanctions or terminated for violating the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment including Thomas A. Parham, former vice chancellor at UC Irvine and former president of the Association of Black Psychologists.\n\nThere are still many places of education such as high schools, however, where legal intervention is not readily enforced for situations where sexual assault takes place.

Price in her book \"Directions in Sexual Harassment Law\" describes how “a major argument for why [laws against] sexual harassment won’t work in education is that issues of sexuality can’t be regulated (similar to the debate in employment) or that adolescent behavior is too unpredictable to be legally controlled” (Price 62). \n\nIt has been noted that, although the financial industry is known to have a wide prevalence of sexual harassment, as of January 2018, there were no high-profile financial executives stepping down as the result of #MeToo allegations. The first widely covered example of concrete consequences in finance was when two reporters, including Madison Marriage of the \"Financial Times\", went undercover at a men-only Presidents Club event meant to raise money for children. Because women were not allowed to attend except as \"hostesses\" in tight, short black dresses with black underwear, Financial Times reporter Madison Marriage and another reporter got jobs as hostesses and documented widespread sexual misconduct. As a result, The presidents Club was shut down.\n\nIn March 2018, Morgan Stanley broker Douglas E. Greenberg was put on administrative leave after a \"New York Times\" story outlined harassment allegations by four women, including multiple arrests for the violation of restraining orders, and a threat to burn down an ex-girlfriend's house. It has been called the #MeToo moment of Portland's financial service industry.\n\nIt has been noted in discussion of #MeToo in finance that only about a quarter of top positions are held by women at several major banks, and there is evidence there may be wide disparities in some financial institutions between how much men and women are paid on average.\n\nStatehouses in California, Illinois, Oregon, and Rhode Island responded to allegations of sexual harassment surfaced by the campaign, and several women in politics spoke out about their experiences of sexual harassment, including United States Senators Heidi Heitkamp, Mazie Hirono, Claire McCaskill and Elizabeth Warren. Congresswoman Jackie Speier has introduced a bill aimed at making sexual harassment complaints easier to report on Capitol Hill. The accusations in the world of Spanish politics have also been published in the media, and a series of allegations and research on MPs and political figures of (all major British political parties) regarding sexual impropriety became a nationwide scandal in 2017; this research was undertaken in the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal and the Me Too movement.\n\nDetective Leslie Branch-Wise of the Denver Police Department spoke publicly for the first time in 2018 about experiencing sexual harassment by Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock. The detective provided sexually suggestive text messages from Hancock sent to her while working for Hancock's security detail in 2012. After six years of keeping the secret, Detective Branch-Wise credited the Me Too movement as an inspiration to share her experience.\n\nJackie Speier proposed the Member and Employee Training and Oversight on Congress Act (ME TOO Congress Act) on November 15, 2017. The full language of the bipartisan bill was revealed by the House on January 18, 2018 as an amendment to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. The purpose of the bill is to change how the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government treats sexual harassment complaints. Under the old system, complaints regarding the legislative branch were channeled through the Office of Compliance, which required complete confidentially through the process and took months of counseling and mediation before a complaint could actually be filed. Any settlement payments were paid using federal taxes, and it was reported that within a decade, $15 million of tax money had been spent settling harassment and discrimination complaints. The bill would ensure future complaints could only take up to 180 days to be filed. The bill would also allow the staffers to transfer to a different department or otherwise work away from the presence of the alleged harasser without losing their jobs if they requested it. The bill would require Representatives and Senators to pay for their own harassment settlements. The Office of Compliance would no longer be allowed to keep settlements secret, and would be required to publicly publish the settlement amounts and the associated employing offices. For the first time, the same protections would also apply to unpaid workers, including pages, fellows and interns.\n\nSoon after #MeToo started spreading in late 2017, several allegations from a 2016 \"Indianapolis Star\" article re-surfaced in the gymnastic industry against former U.S. Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar of Michigan State University. Nassar was called out via #MeToo for sexually assaulting gymnasts as young as 6 years old during \"treatments\". Rachael Denhollander was the first to call him out. Though nothing was done after the initial allegations came out in 2016, after more than 150 women came forward, Nassar was effectively sentenced to life in prison. The president of Michigan State University, Lou Anna Simon, resigned in the wake of the scandal.\n\nMeToo has encouraged discussion about sexual harassment in the medical field. Research had indicated that among U.S. academic medical faculty members, about 30% of women and 4% of men have reported experiencing sexual harassment, and it has been noted that medical staff who complain often receive negative consequences to their careers. Other evidence has indicated 60% of medical trainees and students experienced harassment or discrimination during training, though most do not report the incidents.\n\nIn the music industry, the band Veruca Salt used the #MeToo hashtag to air allegations of sexual harassment against James Toback, and Alice Glass used the hashtag to share a history of alleged sexual assault and other abuses by former Crystal Castles bandmate Ethan Kath.\n\nHalsey's poem \"A Story Like Mine,\" in which she told personal stories of sexual assault and violence throughout her life included accompanying her best friend to Planned Parenthood after she had been raped, her personal account of sexual assault by neighbors and boyfriends, and women sexually assaulted by Olympic doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nIn the wake of #MeToo, #MeTooMilitary came to be used by service men and women who were sexually assaulted or harassed while in the military, appearing on social media in January 2018 the day after remarks by Oprah Winfrey at the Golden Globe Awards honoring female soldiers in the military \"whose names we'll never know\" who have suffered sexual assault and abuse in order to make things better for women today.\n\nA report from the Pentagon indicated that 15,000 members of the military reported being sexually assaulted in the year 2016, and only 1 out of 3 people assaulted actually made a report, indicating as many as 45,000 assaults occurred. Veteran Nichole Bowen-Crawford has said the rates have improved over the last decade, but the military still has a long way to go, and recommends that women veterans connect privately on social media to discuss sexual abuse in a safe environment.\n\nThere was a \"#MeTooMilitary Stand Down\" protest, organized by Service Women's Action Network, which gathered at the Pentagon on January 8, 2018. The protest was endorsed by the U.S. Department of Defense, who stated that current service members were welcome to attend as long as they did not wear their uniform. The protest supported the Military Justice Improvement Act, sponsored by Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, which would move \"the decision over whether to prosecute serious [sex] crimes to independent, trained, professional military prosecutors, while leaving uniquely military crimes within the chain of command\".\n\nThere have been discussions about how pornography is related to the emergence of the #MeToo movement, and what changes, if any, should be made to the porn industry in response. The deaths of five female porn actresses during the first three months of 2018 inspired demands that workers in the industry be included as part of the #MeToo movement. It has been pointed out that many women and men have been sexually assaulted on set. Some high-profile pornographic performers have been accused of assault since the emergence of #MeToo, including James Deen and Ron Jeremy. The porn industry has overall been supportive of #MeToo, with the topics of harassment and bodily autonomy being addressed at the 2018 AVN Awards. There have been calls for the industry to police itself better in the wake of #MeToo. However, when gay actor Tegan Zayne accused fellow actor Topher DiMaggio of rape in a #MeToo post, and four other men came forward with their own allegations of sexual misconduct against DiMaggio, very little happened and there was no official investigation.\n\nSeveral groups of Christians, conservative women, and radical feminists have argued that #MeToo demonstrates pornography causes women to be viewed as sexual objects and contributes to the prevalence of sexual harassment. As a result, these groups believe the production and consumption of pornography should be greatly restricted or made illegal.\n\nOther social advocates and feminists have responded by pointing out that attempts to suppress pornography in the U.S. have historically never been effective at reducing consumption. They note that porn consumption in the U.S. is currently at what is likely the highest levels in history, but overall levels of sexual violence and rape are far lower today than when the anti-pornography movement in the U.S. first emerged during the 1960s. Additionally, many feminists argue that laws which make pornography illegal only further restrict women as far what they are and are not allowed to do with their bodies.\n\nMany feminists have stated that pornography can be empowering or enjoyable for women and depicting female sexuality is not always objectification. Others point out that a lot of porn is made by women and for women. Award-winning porn actress and director Angela White says there is a \"large positive shift within the industry\" to more women directing and producing their own content and \"to represent women as powerful sexual beings.\" Anti-porn activist Melissa Farley has said this ignores the \"choicelessness\" faced by many actresses in porn. Liberal advocates argue that anti-pornography movements in the U.S. have historically never tried to increase choices for vulnerable adult performers, and taking away a person's right to act in porn may hurt them economically by reducing their choices. Many adult performers have stated that the social stigma surrounding their type of work is already a major barrier when they're seeking help, and making porn illegal would leave them few options if they are suffering from sexual abuse.\n\nAs a result of #MeToo, many adult performers, sex worker advocates and feminists have called for greater protections for pornographic actresses, for example reducing social stigmas, mandating training courses that teach performers their rights, and providing access to independent hotlines where performers can report abuse. They argue that making porn illegal would only cause the production of porn to go underground where there are even fewer options for help. Some liberal activists have argued to compromise by raising the legal age of entry into adult entertainment from 18 to 21, which would prevent some of the most vulnerable women from being taken advantage of, while allowing adult women to still do what they want with their own bodies.\n\nSome have pointed out that many young people who do not receive a sex education adopt ideas about sex and sexual roles from pornography, whose fantasy depictions of those behaviors are not accurate to life, as they are designed for purposes of adult entertainment, and not educating the public on the reality of sexual behavior. Some areas of the United States teach birth-control methods only by abstinence from sex. In a 2015 article for the \"American Journal of Nursing\" David Carter noted that a study found that abstinence based education was \"correlated with increases in teenage pregnancies and births\". Multiple people have voiced support for comprehensive sex education programs that encompass a wide range topics, which they state leave children more informed. Several feminists have argued it is crucial to provide children with basic sex education before they are inevitably exposed to porn. Sex education can also effectively prepare children to identify and say no to unwanted sexual contact before it occurs, and gives parents an opportunity to teach children about consent.\n\nThe original purpose of \"Me Too\" as used by Tarana Burke in 2006, was to empower women through empathy, especially young and vulnerable women. In October 2017, Alyssa Milano encouraged using the phrase as a hashtag to help reveal the extent of problems with sexual harassment and assault by showing how many people have experienced these events themselves.\n\nAfter millions of people started using the phrase, and it spread to dozens of other languages, the purpose changed and expanded, as a result, it has come to mean different things to different people. Tarana Burke accepts the title of the leader and creator of the movement but has stated she considers herself a worker of something much bigger. Burke has stated that this movement has grown to include both men and women of all colors and ages, as it continues to support marginalized people in marginalized communities. There have also been movements by men aimed at changing the culture through personal reflection and future action, including #IDidThat, #IHave, and #IWill.\n\nAnalyses of the movement often point to the prevalence of sexual violence, which has been estimated by the World Health Organization to affect one-third of all women worldwide. A 2017 poll by ABC News and \"The Washington Post\" also found that 54% of American women report receiving \"unwanted and inappropriate\" sexual advances with 95% saying that such behavior usually goes unpunished. Others state that #MeToo underscores the need for men to intervene when they witness demeaning behavior.\n\nBurke said that #MeToo declares sexual violence sufferers are not alone and should not be ashamed. Burke says sexual violence is usually caused by someone the woman knows, so people should be educated from a young age they have the right to say no to sexual contact from any person, even after repeat solicitations from an authority or spouse, and to report predatory behavior. Burke advises men to talk to each other about consent, call out demeaning behavior when they see it and try to listen to victims when they tell their stories.\n\nAlyssa Milano described the reach of #MeToo as helping society understand the \"magnitude of the problem\" and said, \"it's a standing in solidarity to all those who have been hurt.\" She stated that the success of #MeToo will require men to take a stand against behavior that objectifies women.\n\nBurke has stated the current purpose of the movement is to give people the resources to have access to healing, and advocates for changes to laws and policies. Burke has highlighted goals such as processing all untested rape kits, re-examining local school policies, improving the vetting of teachers, and updating sexual harassment policies. She has called for all professionals who work with children to be fingerprinted and subjected to a background check before being cleared to start work. She advocates for sex education that teaches kids to report predatory behavior immediately. Burke supports the #MeToo bill in the US Congress, which would remove the requirement that staffers of the federal government go through months of \"cooling off\" before being allowed to file a complaint against a Congressperson.\n\nMilano states a priority for #MeToo is changing the laws surrounding sexual harassment and assault, for example, instituting protocols that give sufferers in all industries the ability to file complaints without retaliation. She supports legislation making it difficult for publicly traded companies to hide cover-up money from their stockholders and would like to make it illegal for employers to require new workers sign non-disclosure agreements as a condition of employment. Gender analysts such as Anna North have stated that #MeToo should be addressed as a labor issue due to the economic disadvantages to reporting harassment. North suggested combating underlying power imbalances in some workplaces, for example by raising the tipped minimum wage, and embraces innovations like the \"portable panic buttons\" that are mandated for hotel employees in Seattle.\n\nOthers have suggested that barriers to employment must be removed, such as the job requirement by some employers to sign non-disclosure agreements or other agreements that prevent an employee from talking about their employment publicly, or taking disputes (including sexual harassment claims) to arbitration or legal proceedings. It's been suggested that legislation should be passed that bans these types of mandatory pre-employment agreements.\n\nSome policy-based changes that have been suggested is reducing limited managerial oversight; creating clear internal reporting mechanisms; more effective and proactive disciplinary measures; creating a culture that encourages employees to be open about serious problems; making financial penalties for workers who work for companies that allow those workers to remain in their position when they have repeatedly sexually harassed others; and force companies to pay huge fines or lose tax breaks if they decide to keep workers that are sexual harassers around.\n\nIn the coverage of #MeToo, there has been widespread discussion about the best way for sufferers of sexual abuse or harassment to stop what is happening to them at work. There is general agreement that a lack of effective reporting options is a major factor that drives unchecked sexual misconduct in the workplace.\n\nFalse reports of sexual assault are rare but when they happen, they are put in the spotlight for the public to see. The media does this to portray the image that the majority of the reported sexual assaults are falsely reported by women. However, falsely reported sexual assaults only make up 3% of the total amount that are reported. This doesn’t even take into account the amount of women that still don’t report their stories. This is yet another reason why women are scared to report their experiences with sexual assault because they are afraid that no one will ever believe their story and in the process they will have embarrassed and humiliated themselves.\n\nIn France, a person who makes a sexual harassment complaint at work is reprimanded or fired 40% of the time, while the accused person is typically not investigated or punished. In the United States, a 2016 report from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission states that although 25–85% of women say they experience sexual harassment at work, few ever report the incidents, most commonly due to fear of reprisal. There is evidence that in Japan, as few as 4% of rape victims report the crime, and the charges are dropped about half the time.\n\nThere is a discussion on the best ways to handle whisper networks, or private lists of \"people to avoid\" that are shared unofficially in nearly every major institution or industry where sexual harassment is common due to power imbalances, including government, media, news, and academia. These lists have the stated purpose of warning other workers in the industry and are shared from person-to-person, on forums, in private social media groups, and via spreadsheets. However, these lists can become \"weaponized\" and used to spread unsubstantiated gossip, which has been discussed widely in the media.\n\nDefenders say the lists provide a way to warn other people in the industry if worried about punishment, or if complaints have already been ignored, and also helps victims identify each other so they can speak out together. Sometimes these lists are kept for other reasons, for example, a spreadsheet from the United Kingdom called \"High Libido MPs\" and dubbed \"the spreadsheet of shame\" was created by a group of male and female parliamentary researchers, and contained a list of allegations against nearly 40 Conservative MPs in the British Parliament. It is also rumored that party whips (who are in charge of getting members of Parliament to commit to votes) maintain a \"black book\" that contains allegations against several lawmakers that can be used for blackmail. When it is claimed a well-known person's sexual misconduct was an \"open secret\", these lists are often the source. In the wake of #MeToo, several private whisper network lists have been leaked to the public.\n\nIn India, a student gave her friends a list containing names of professors and academics in the Indian university system to be avoided. The list went viral after it was posted on social media. In response to criticism in the media, the authors defended themselves by saying they were only trying to warn their friends, had confirmed every case, and several victims from the list were poor students who had already been punished or ignored when trying to come forward. Moira Donegan, a New York City-based journalist, privately shared a crowd-sourced Shitty Media Men list of people to avoid in publishing and journalism. When it was shared outside her private network, Donegan lost her job. Donegan stated it was unfair so few people had access to the list before it went public; for example, very few women of color received access (and therefore protection) from it. She pointed to her \"whiteness, health, education, and class\" that allowed her to take the risk of sharing the list and getting fired.\n\nThe main problem with trying to protect more potential victims by publishing whisper networks is determining the best mechanism to verify allegations in a way that is fair to all parties. Some suggestions have included strengthening labor unions in vulnerable industries so workers can report harassment directly to the union instead of to an employer. Another suggestion is to maintain industry hotlines which have the power to trigger third-party investigations. Several apps have been developed which offer various ways to report sexual misconduct, and some of these apps also have the ability to connect victims who have reported the same person.\n\nIn the wake of #MeToo, many countries such as the U.S., India, France, China, Japan, and Italy, have seen discussion in the media on whether cultural norms need to be changed for sexual harassment to be eradicated in the workplace.\n\nDr. John Launer of Health Education England stated leaders must be made aware of common \"mismatches of perceptions\" at work to reduce incidents where one person thinks they are flirting while the other person feels like they're being demeaned or harassed. Reporter Anna North from \"Vox\" states one way to address #MeToo is teach children the basics of sex. North states the cultural notion that women do not enjoy sex leads men \"to believe that a lukewarm yes is all they're ever going to get\", referring to a 2017 study which found that men who believe women enjoy being forced into sex are \"more likely to perceive women as consenting\". Alyssa Rosenberg of \"The Washington Post\" called for society to be careful of overreaching by \"being clear about what behavior is criminal, what behavior is legal but intolerable in a workplace, and what private intimate behavior is worthy of condemnation\" but not part of the workplace discussion. She says \"preserving the nuances\" is more inclusive and realistic.\n\nProfessor Daniel Drezner stated that #MeToo laid the groundwork for two major cultural shifts. One is the acceptance that sexual harassment (not just sexual assault) is unacceptable in the workplace. The other is that when a powerful person is accused of sexual harassment, the reaction should be a presumption that the less powerful accuser is \"likely telling the truth, because the risks of going public are great.\" However, he states society is struggling with the speed at which change is being demanded.\n\nAlthough #MeToo initially focused on adults, the message spread to students in K–12 schools where sexual abuse is common both in person and online. MeTooK12 is a spin-off of #MeToo created in January 2018 by the group Stop Sexual Assault in Schools, founded by Joel Levin and Esther Warkov, aimed at stopping sexual abuse in education from kindergarten to high school. #MeTooK12 was inspired in part by the removal of certain federal Title IX sexual misconduct guidelines. There is evidence that sexual misconduct in K–12 education is dramatically underreported by both schools and students, because nearly 80% of public schools never report any incidents of harassment. A 2011 survey found 40% of boys and 56% of girls in grades 7–12 reported had experienced some type of negative sexual comment or sexual harassment in their lives. Approximately 5% of K–12 sexual misconduct reports involved 5 or 6-year-old students. #MeTooK12 is meant to demonstrate the widespread prevalence of sexual misconduct towards children in school, and the need for increased training on Title IX policies, as only 18 states require people in education to receive training about what to do when a student or teacher is sexually abused.\n\nThere has been discussion about what possible roles men may have in the #MeToo movement. It has been noted that 1 in 6 men have experienced sexual abuse of some sort during their lives and often feel unable to talk about it. Creator Tarana Burke and others have asked men to call out bad behavior when they see it, or just spend time quietly listening. Some men have expressed the desire to keep a greater distance from women since #MeToo went viral because they do not fully understand what actions might be considered inappropriate. For the first few months after #MeToo started trending, many men expressed difficulty in participating in the conversation due to fear of negative consequences, citing examples of men who have been treated negatively after sharing their thoughts about #MeToo.\n\nAuthor and former pick-up artist Michael Ellsberg encourages men to reflect on past behavior and examples of questionable sexual behavior, such as the viral story Cat Person, which is written from the perspective of a twenty-year-old woman who goes on a date with a much older man and ends up having an unpleasant sexual experience that was consensual but unwanted. Ellsberg has asked men to pledge to ensure women are mutually interested in initiating a sexual encounter and to slow down if there is ever doubt a woman wants to continue.\n\nRelationship instructor Kasia Urbaniak said the movement is creating its own crisis around masculinity. \"There's a reflective questioning about whether they’re going to be next and if they’ve ever hurt a woman. There's a level of anger and frustration. If you’ve been doing something wrong but haven't been told, there's an incredible sense of betrayal and it’ll provoke a backlash. I think silence on both sides is incredibly dangerous.\" Urbaniak says she would like women to be allies of men and to be curious about their experience. \"In that alliance there's a lot more power and possibility than there is in men stepping aside and starting to stew.\"\n\nIn August 2018, \"The New York Times\" detailed allegations that leading #MeToo figure Asia Argento sexually assaulted actor Jimmy Bennett. The sexual assault allegedly took place in a California hotel room in 2013 when he was only two months past his 17th birthday and she was 37; the age of consent is 18. Bennett said when Argento came out against Harvey Weinstein, it stirred memories of his own experience. He imparted he had sought to resolve the matter privately, and had not spoken out sooner, “because I was ashamed and afraid to be part of the public narrative.” In a statement provided to \"The Times\", he said: \"I was underage when the event took place, and I tried to seek justice in a way that made sense to me at the time because I was not ready to deal with the ramifications of my story becoming public. At the time I believed there was still a stigma to being in the situation as a male in our society. I didn’t think that people would understand the event that took place from the eyes of a teenage boy.\" Bennett said he would like to \"move past this event in my life,\" adding, “today I choose to move forward, no longer in silence.\" Argento, who quietly arranged a $380,000 nondisclosure settlement with Bennett in the months following her revelations regarding Weinstein, has denied the allegations. Rose McGowan initially expressed support for Argento on and implored others to show restraint, tweeting, \"None of us know the truth of the situation and I'm sure more will be revealed. Be gentle.\" As one of the most vocal advocates of the Me Too movement, McGowan faced criticism on social media for her comments, which conflicted with the movement's message of believing survivors. MeToo founder Tarana Burke responded the Asia Argento report, stating \"I’ve said repeatedly that the #metooMVMT is for all of us, including these brave young men who are now coming forward. Sexual violence is about power and privilege. That doesn’t change if the perpetrator is your favorite actress, activist or professor of any gender.\"\n\nThe related hashtag #HimToo emerged in popularity with the #MeToo movement. Although dating back to at least 2015, and initially associated with politics or casual communication, #HimToo took on new meanings associated with #MeToo in 2017, with some using it to emphasize male victims of sexual harassment and abuse, and others using it to emphasize male perpetrators. In September and October 2018, during the sexual assault allegations raised during Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, #HimToo became used by supporters of Kavanaugh and to highlight male victims of false accusations.\nSome feminists and women have criticized the movement.\n\nThere has been discussion about whether the movement is meant to inspire change in all men or just a percentage of them, and what specific actions are the end goal of the movement. Other women have stated #MeToo should examine only the worst types of abuse in order to prevent casting all men as perpetrators, or causing people to become numb to the problem.\n\nCreator Tarana Burke has laid out specific goals for the #MeToo movement, including: processing all untested rape kits in the United States, investigating the vetting of teachers, better protecting children at school, updating sexual harassment policies, and improving training in workplaces, places of worship, and schools. She has stated that everyone in a community, including men and women, must take action in order to make the #MeToo movement a success. She also supports the #MeToo Congress bill and hopes it will inspire similar legal changes in other parts of the country.\n\nRichard Ackland, a lawyer and award-winning journalist, described the response to defamation cases \"an asphyxiating vortex of litigation\".\n\nThere has been discussion on whether harsh consequences are warranted for particular examples of alleged misconduct. An especially divisive story broke on Babe.net on January 13, 2018 when an anonymous accuser detailed the events of her date with Aziz Ansari and referred to what transpired as \"sexual assault\". Jill Filipovic wrote for \"The Guardian\" that \"it was only a matter of time before a publication did us the disservice of publishing a sensational story of a badly behaved man who was nonetheless not a sexual assailant\".\n\nSome actors have admonished proponents of the movement for not distinguishing between different degrees of sexual misconduct. Matt Damon commented on the phenomenon in an interview, and later apologized, saying \"the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it. Because if you take responsibility for what you did, your life's going to get ruined.\" Subsequently, Liam Neeson opined that some accused men, including Garrison Keillor and Dustin Hoffman, were being treated unfairly.\n\nTarana Burke said in January 2018, \"Those of us who do this work know that backlash is inevitable.\" While describing the backlash as carrying an underlying sentiment of fairness, she defended her movement as \"not a witch hunt as people try to paint it\". She stated that engaging with the cultural critique in #MeToo was more productive than calling for it to end or focusing on accused men who \"haven't actually touched anybody\". Ronan Farrow, who published the Weinstein exposé in the \"New Yorker\" that helped start the #MeToo resurgence (alongside \"New York Times\" reporters Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor), was asked in late December 2017 whether he thought the movement had \"gone too far\". Farrow called for a careful examination of each story to guard against false accusations but also recalled the alleged sexual abuse his sister Dylan Farrow claims she went through at the hands of his father Woody Allen. He stated that after decades of silence, \"My feeling is that this is a net benefit to society and that all of the people, men, and women, pouring forward and saying 'me too' deserve this moment. I think you're right to say that we all have to be conscious of the risk of the pendulum swinging too far, but in general this is a very positive step.\"\n\nIjeoma Oluo spoke about how some Democrats have expressed regret over the resignation of Senator Al Franken due to allegations of sexual misconduct. She sympathized with them but stressed the importance of punishing misconduct regardless of whether the perpetrator is viewed as \"a bad guy\" overall. She wrote that \"most abusers are more like Al Franken than Harvey Weinstein\". \"The New York Times\" has called this discussion the \"Louis C.K. Conundrum\", referring to the admission by comedian Louis C.K. that he committed sexual misconduct with five women, and the subsequent debate over whether any guilt should be associated with enjoyment of his work. Jennifer Wright of \"Harper's Bazaar\" has said that public fears of an overcorrection reflect the difficulty of accepting that \"likeable men can abuse women too\".\n\nThe hashtag has been criticized for putting the responsibility of publicizing sexual harassment and abuse on those who experienced it, which could be re-traumatizing. The hashtag has been criticized as inspiring fatigue and outrage, rather than emotionally dense communication.\n\nTony Robbins said he was \"knocking victimhood\" from the movement.The motivational speaker was also scrutinized for comments he made criticizing the movement, implying that women are victimizing themselves to gain significance. He later apologized adding, \"I need to get connected to the brave women of #MeToo.\"\n\nThere have been many calls for the #MeToo movement to include sex workers and sex trafficking victims. Although these women experience a higher rate of sexual harassment and assault than any other group of people, they are often seen in society as legitimate targets that deserve such acts against them. Autumn Burris stated that prostitution is like \"#MeToo on steroids\" because the sexual harassment and assault described in #MeToo stories are frequent for women in prostitution. Melissa Farley argues that prostitution, even when consensual, can be a form of sexual assault, as it can be for money for food or similar items, thus, at least according to Farley, making prostitution a forced lifestyle relying on coercions for food. Some sex workers disagree with her stance, saying that she stigmatizes prostitution.\n\nAmerican journalist Steven Thrasher noted that, \"There has been worry that the #MeToo movement could lead to a sex panic. But the real sex panic is not due to feminism run amok, but due to the patriarchal, homophobic, transantagonistic, theocratic desire of the US Congress to control sex workers.\" He points to 2018 Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), which many experts say will only put sex workers at further risk by causing them to go underground, does not offer sex workers any help or protections, and as a side effect prevents most people from using online personal ads regardless of their intentions.\n\nThere has been discussion about the extent to which accusers should be believed before fact-checking. Some have questioned whether the accused are being punished without due process confirming their guilt.\n\nMany commentators have responded that the number of false reports is expected to be low, citing figures obtained by the U.S. Department of Justice and other organizations which estimate the number of false rape accusations to be around 2–10%. However, the 2-10% figure refers to rape reports which are found to be false, and does not include cases in which it cannot be established if the accused is innocent or guilty.\n\nA February 2005 study by the UK Home Office on reported rape cases found that from a set of 216 rape cases later found to be false, only six led to arrests and only two involved charges being filed. \"Elle\" writer Sady Doyle commented that another hashtag, #BelieveWomen, was not a threat to due process but a commitment to \"recognize that false allegations are less common than real ones\". Jennifer Wright of \"Harper's Bazaar\" proposed a similar definition of #BelieveWomen and pointed out \"The Washington Post\" ability to quickly identify a false accusation set up by Project Veritas. She also stated that only 52 rape convictions being overturned in the United States since 1989, as opposed to 790 for murder, was strong evidence that at least 90% of rape allegations are true. Michelle Malkin challenged this claim, citing the book \"False Allegations\" by Brent Turvey, John Savino and Aurelio Coronado Mares, which states that published research about false rape accusations indicate that the percentage ranges from 8–41%.> She expressed a suspicion that many stories in the #MeToo movement would be exaggerated and accused news outlets of focusing on \"hashtag trends spread by celebrities, anonymous claimants and bots\".\n\nOn November 30, 2017, Ijeoma Oluo revealed the contents of a request she received from \"USA Today\", asking her to write a piece arguing that due process is unnecessary for sexual harassment allegations. She refused, saying \"of course I believe in due process\" and wrote that it was disingenuous for the paper to ask her \"to be their strawman\".\n\nOn September 21, 2018, President Donald Trump accused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford of making up her accusations against now Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, saying that if her story was true she would have filed a report against him when it had happened. This is a common argument against the MeToo movement and sexual assault victims alike.\n\nOn 11 October 2018 Melania Trump, wife of US President Donald Trump, said that women who make accusations of sexual abuse against men should back their claims with solid evidence.\n\nDespite the prevalence of sexual misconduct, some have pointed out the lack of discussion in the #MeToo movement regarding law-enforcement misconduct.\nPolice sexual misconduct disproportionately affects women of color, though women from all walks of life are affected. The Cato Institute reported that in 2010, more than 9% of police misconduct reports in 2010 involved sexual abuse, and there are multiple indications that \"sexual assault rates are significantly higher for police when compared to the general population.\" Fear of retribution is considered one reason some law-enforcement officers are not subjected to significant consequences for known misconduct. Police-reform activist Roger Goldman stated that an officer who is fired for sexual misconduct from one police department often gets rehired by a different department, where they can continue the misconduct in a new environment. Some states (such as Florida and Georgia) have licensing laws that can decertify a law-enforcement officer who has committed major misconduct, which prevents decertified officers from being hired again in that state. Some have called for sexual misconduct allegations against police to be investigated by third parties to reduce bias (as opposed to the common practice of investigations being led by fellow law-enforcement officers or colleagues in the same department).\n\nMany have pointed to a lack of representation of minority women in the #MeToo movement or its leadership. Most historical feminist movements have contained active elements of racism, and have typically ignored the needs of non-white women despite the fact that minority women are more likely to be targets of sexual harassment.\n\nMinority women are overrepresented in industries with the greatest number of sexual harassment claims, for example hotels, health, food services, and retail. It has been pointed out that undocumented minority women often have no recourse if they're experiencing sexual violence. Activist Charlene Carruthers said, \"If wealthy, highly visible women in news and entertainment are sexually harassed, assaulted and raped—what do we think is happening to women in retail, food service and domestic work?\"\n\nFormer victim Farah Tanis stated there are also additional barriers for black women who want to participate in the #MeToo movement. She pointed out that there is often social pressure not to report allegations against black men, especially from church and family, because many would view that as a betrayal against their \"brothers.\" Additionally, black women are less likely to be believed if they do speak out.\n\nSome have argued that the American judicial system acknowledges the term \"sexual harassment\" only because of successful sexual harassment lawsuits by three black women: Diane Williams and Paulette Barnes against the US government, and Mechelle Vinson against a bank. Vinson's case of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson eventually leading to the unanimous 1986 Supreme Court decision that sexual harassment violates the Civil Rights Act. Black law professor Anita Hill again brought sexual harassment to public discourse in 1991 with her testimony against Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas.\n\nTarana Burke initially criticized the movement for ignoring the work of black women in creating dialogue addressing sexual assault. However, she did salute those who partook in the movement and credited Milano for acknowledging Burke's own similar movement. As well as this, she pleaded to black women not to drop out of the movement just because the media isn't listening saying \"This is your movement, too.\"\n\nAmerican feminist and journalist Gloria Steinem said there is a blind spot surrounding intersectionality between race and gender, and a major problem with today's feminists is they are not acknowledging \"that women of color in general—and especially black women—have always been more likely to be feminist than white women.\" Steinem argues that #MeToo could never have happened without the work of these women, and women in the #MeToo movement have a responsibility: “If you have more power, remember to listen as much as you talk. And if you have less power, remember to talk as much as you listen.\"\n\nThe #MeToo movement has been criticized for putting too much public focus on the consequences of specific individuals who have been accused of sexual misconduct, as opposed to discussing policies and changes to institutional norms that would help people who are currently experiencing sexual abuse. It's been noted that although allegations surrounding high-profile public figures tends to attract the most attention, the stories of regular workers often go unacknowledged. Yet to ensure meaningful change, these workers’ experiences must be at the center of any policy solutions that lawmakers pursue. Tarana Burke has voiced similar misgivings, pointing out one problematic aspect of #MeToo is \"All of this media attention is on the perpetrator. All of the conversation about fairness and due process is focused on the perpetrator.\" She states the movement should focus on specific steps to help current and future sufferers. Activist and writer Jaclyn Friedman said, \"We’ve got to stop treating each case that comes to light like a self-contained soap opera that ends when the villain is defeated, and start addressing the systems that have enabled workplace sexual abuse for so long.\" Writer Jia Tolentino has stated that it is natural to focus on the individual stories because they are \"gripping and horrible\", but determining the best workplace changes \"doesn't have a ton to do with the specific investigation and adjudication of men that have already done this\".\n\nIn May 2018, The New York Women's Foundation announced their Fund to Support the Me Too Movement and Allies, a $25M commitment over the next five years to provide funding and support survivors of sexual violence.\n\nIn September 2018, CBS announced that it would be donating $20 million of former Chairman Les Moonves' severance to #MeToo. Moonves was forced to step down after numerous sexual misconduct accusations.\n\nThe hashtag has trended in at least 85 countries, including India, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom. Direct translations of #MeToo have been shared by Spanish speakers in South America and Europe and by Arabic speakers in Africa and the Middle East, while activists in France and Italy have developed hashtags to express the attitudes of the movement. Communicating similar experiences and \"sharing feelings in some form of togetherness\" connects people and can lead to \"formation of a process of collective action\" (Castells). The campaign has prompted survivors from around the world to share their stories, and name their perpetrators. The European Parliament convened a session directly in response to the Me Too campaign, after it gave rise to allegations of abuse in Parliament and in the European Union's offices in Brussels. Cecilia Malmström, the European Commissioner for Trade, specifically cited the hashtag as the reason the meeting had been convened.\n\n\nThe #MeToo hashtag initially spread in Afghanistan where it is estimated about 90% of women experience sexual harassment in public, at school, or at work, but was quickly silenced when those who shared their stories started fearing for their life. Less than 1% of police officers or military members are women, and sexual assault is often ignored by law enforcement and the military. Rape threats and other types of harassment are common on Facebook and other social media in Afghanistan. Sharing stories of sexual abuse against higher-ranking men is especially dangerous for women in the country, and may result in the killing of the victim or her family members. Some women are also punished or killed to by their own family for speaking out, to redeem their \"honor\" after being tarnished by rape. Despite the risks, some notable people such as \"Sarienews\" journalist Maryam Mehtar, and presidential advisor Shaharzad Akbar have shared their own #MeToo stories on social media. Mehtar experienced extreme abuse and several death threats for sharing her story about being sexually harassed in public on a daily basis, and was publicly called a \"whore\" in an interview with \"The New York Times\" by Afghan writer Jalil Junbish. He also called the NYT reporter a whore in the same interview. He later denied making the comments. Other women only share their first name or a fake name, and typically describe the story without naming the perpetrator for fear of reprisal. Sexual harassment was first defined in Afghanistan in 2016, though there has been little effort made to enforce laws against it. Rod Nordland and Fatima Faizi of \"The New York Times\" reported that a colonel in the Afghan Air Force was secretly and clearly videotaped sexually assaulting a subordinate in November 2017, and the video quickly went viral, but despite an alleged investigation, the colonel has not been formally accused of misconduct. The Ministries of Interior and Communications set up a phone hotline to for women to call to report sexual misconduct from law enforcement officials, but a call to the line revealed the hotline will offer advice only about phone harassment, and stated if a person harasses you in person, to \"slap them\".\n\nIn October 2017 reporter and journalist Tracey Spicer announced on Twitter that she was launching an investigation into reports of sexual harassment by powerful Australian men in the media in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations and the rise in public awareness of the #MeToo movement. Earlier that same year, Spicer had released a memoir, \"The Good Girl Stripped Bare\", where she wrote about her own experiences of sexual harassment in the work place. Spicer later reported that she had received responses from 470 people about people in the industry, including Australian television presenter and producer Don Burke. The extent of the claims against Burke were published by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and The Sydney Morning Herald in a joint investigative piece on 26 November 2017, where it was reported that \"One name kept recurring – Don Burke.\"Spicer, along with Kate McClymont, Lorna Knowles and Alison Branley, won the 2018 Walkley Awards in the print/text journalism and Television/Video Current Affairs Short (less than 20 minutes) categories for their investigation and on Australia Day in 2018, Spicer was appointed as a Member of the Order of Australia \"for significant service to the broadcast media as a journalist and television presenter, and as an ambassador for social welfare and charitable groups\". Later that same year, Spicer and Melinda Schneider launched NOW Australia, a campaign aimed at helping connect people with legal support and counselling.\n\nSince then the #MeToo movement has now expanded beyond Australian media and the Australian Human Rights Commission has launched an independent search into workplace sexual harassment that is the first of its kind in the world.\n\nIt has been hypothesised by \"The Age\" that Australia's strict defamation laws make it difficult for more victims to come forward.\n\nIn French-speaking parts of Canada, the campaign is done under the hashtag . A minister of Quebec, , said she believed a global movement was in the works and we should salute this change. It was reported that calls to rape and women's crisis centers have increased dramatically, up to 553% above normal levels, since started trending in October 2017, causing problems with staffing and budgeting. Quebec has contributed $1 million to help support these crisis hotlines. Hundreds of people marched to promote at an event in Toronto in December 2017. In the wake of , a candidate for mayor of dropped out of the race in response to allegations of sexual misconduct from several women. Montreal police set up a phone hotline for people who have been raped or harassed to call. Radio and TV presenter was accused by 11 people of either being sexually harassed, or witnessing harassment from . He lost several endorsements and was suspended from most projects he was involved with. Humorist resigned from all his positions and tried to sell his company in the wake of several sexual misconduct allegations, including one from producer , a class action lawsuit from several women, and a sexual assault report filed with the police.\n\nA newly popular hashtag, (#AndNow or Now What?) has started spreading as the \"second part\" to to discuss what to do now that the magnitude of the problem with sexual misconduct in the workplace has been exposed. is represented by a yellow heart. It was unveiled on the show in January 2018, with the stated purpose of determining which attitudes related to society, politics, institutions, and media need to be changed to ensure equity between all people.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been a vocal advocate and supporter of the #MeToo movement. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in January 2018, Trudeau called for critical discussion on issues brought up by the #MeToo, Time's Up, and Women's March movements. Trudeau has also advocated and acted upon a high standard set for himself and members of his government. Trudeau stated that he holds a \"zero tolerance for sexual assault, harassment or other forms of misconduct by his employees or caucus colleagues\". As leader of the Liberal party, Trudeau initiated investigations on several members of parliament resulting in the dismissal of cabinet minister Kent Hehr, the resignation of MP Darshan Kang, and the suspension and later expulsion of MPs Scott Andrews and Massimo Pacetti. In an interview, Trudeau explained that the zero tolerance standard applied to himself as well and stated, \"I've been very, very careful all my life to be thoughtful, to be respectful of people's space and people's headspace as well.\"\n\nHowever, an editorial written in August 2000 resurfaced during his premiership regarding an alleged incident where author accused Trudeau of groping a reporter and in July 2018 Trudeau publicly rejected the accusations. The piece stated Trudeau provided a \"day-late\" apology to the reporter, saying, \"If I had known you were reporting for a national paper, I never would have been so forward.\" On July 6 Trudeau stated there was no need to conduct an investigation into the allegations against him.\n\nIn April–June 2018, female students marched around Chile and occupied universities in protest against sexual harassment. Multiple actresses levelled accusations of Weinstein-like behaviour at telenovela director Herval Abreu in April and film director Nicolás López in June; both men have denied any wrongdoing.\n\nOn Chinese social networks, hashtags #WoYeShi or #metoo are sometimes used to denote the #Metoo hashtag.\n\nIn mainland China, the Chinese internet censorship service has slowed down the Chinese MeToo posts via censorship. So far, the #MeToo debate appears to be limited to universities.\n\nAn article appearing on the state-run \"China Daily\" newspaper states that sexual misconduct is rare in China due to superior education and culture has caused considerable Internet outrages.\n\nA recent study from a pair of professors from City University of Hong Kong indicated that about 80% of working women in China have experienced sexual harassment at some point in their career, and there were strong reactions of anger online following the report. The article has since been taken down. Activist Feng Yuan points out that China does not have national laws prohibiting sexual harassment, and uses state media to encourage women to focus on family and stay home. New laws recently made it illegal for television programming to contain images of a women's cleavage, sexual acts outside of marriage, or any topics that present \"Western lifestyles\" in a positive light. #MeToo has received extreme governmental censorship online.\n\nSophie Richardson, the Human Rights Watch director for China, stated the Chinese government regularly suppresses discussion of women's rights, for example an incident in 2015 where Li Tingting and four other activists were arrested when the government learned they planned to hand out stickers about preventing sexual harassment on public transportation.\n\nIn Hong Kong, track and field athlete Vera Lui Lai-Yiu posted her case of sex abuse alongside #metoo on her Facebook fanpage on her 23rd birthday. She posted in response to a similar action by gymnast McKayla Maroney. Lui posted a picture of herself holding a piece of paper with the handwritten words \"#metoo lly\" (her initials). In January 2018, student Zheng Xi publicly started a campaign against sexual harassment in response to #MeToo.\n\nDr. Luo Xixi, an academic, revealed being sexually assaulted by a professor at Beihang University when she was in her 20s. Luo gathered extensive evidence from many women, including recordings, and presented it to the institution. She waited until the professor was already suspended before going public with the story. Her post was viewed over 3 million times within 24 hours. She said that #metoo gave her the courage to speak up. She is currently living in the US.\n\nAlyssa Milano specifically called for supporting the victims in Ethiopia in an interview with \"Rolling Stone\". In Ethiopia, up to 40% of students may have experienced sexual violence. In November 2017, nine middle-school aged girls organized together and spoke out about an abusive teacher in their school, saying they got the idea from the \"Me Too\" movement. The teacher was dismissed and referred to law enforcement. UNICEF's Amanda Westfall said the teacher likely would have gotten away with it just a few years ago.\n\nVariants of the phrase trended in France, especially (#DenounceYourPig), which encouraged users to share the names of their alleged abusers. was first used by Sandra Muller. She was requested to take down her tweet by two lawyers. In France, 93% of complaints against criminal sexual harassment are dropped or never followed up on by law enforcement. Prosecutions are extremely rare, and only 65 of 1,048 sexual harassment lawsuits from 2014 actually led to a conviction. In 40% of workplace sexual violence cases, the person who makes the complaint is reprimanded or fired, while the accused person is typically not investigated or punished. There is no French equivalent to U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which gives victims a place to report workplace sexual violence if the employer and/or law enforcement refuses to address the complaint. , wife of French President , expressed support for the #MeToo movement.\n\nInitially the hashtag went viral, but there was an almost immediate media backlash. Soon after, 100 high-profile French women, including actress , former pornographic actress and radio host , art critic and author , signed an open letter by which criticized the #MeToo / #BalanceTonPorc campaign. It was noted the letter is poorly edited with several typos and unclear or clumsy passages.\n\nThe people who signed the letter, especially and , were criticized for saying men should have the \"right to pester\" women. The letter also told people not to be bothered by small amounts of sexual harassment, for example men who rub against women on public transportation. The letter states women should \"consider it as the expression of a great sexual misery, or even as a nonevent\". French politician said some aspects of the letter were \"profoundly shocking\" and \"we have immense difficulty convincing young women that when a man rubs his genitals against a woman in the Métro without her consent, it is an act of sexual assault that can lead to three years in prison and a 75,000 euro fine.\"\n\nA week after its publication, issued a letter of clarification, and said although she still agrees with the spirit of the original letter, she wants to clarify that she does believe sexual harassment and assault are real problems, and apologized to all victims of unpleasant sexual acts who read the letter and felt hurt by it.\n\nPolitical commentator said the movement to prevent sexual misconduct at work is more accepted by younger women in France because they take sexual freedom as a given, while older feminists are afraid #MeToo may hurt the sexual revolution. Legal professional noted that when people are given \"concrete examples\" of sexual misconduct, they often \"change their minds and acknowledge how harmful some situations can be\". French politician said that the #MeToo movement will continue because French women have been silenced for too long. A petition aimed at President demanded sexual harassment to be taken more seriously in France, and received more than 100,000 signatures in 3 days.\n\nSinger Tom Connan said in an interview published by L'Obs that he had been the victim of sexual harassment and claimed that men (not only women) were also affected by the problem.\n\nMeToo was not particularly popular in Germany until January 11, 2018, when it started trending after the weekly newspaper published reports about three German former actresses who alleged that award-winning TV director had committed sexual assault. There have been official concerns about the alleged long-time coverup of 's actions because most of his work was done through public broadcasting and received government money. The report detailed a months-long investigation into the three allegations, and included 50 interviews. has not responded to the allegations in , stating through a spokesperson he is in the hospital and having heart trouble. Another high-profile German case concerned the former president of the Munich Academy of Music, Siegfried Mauser. In a study of 2000 Germans conducted after the initial spread of #MeToo, it was found that 43% of women and 12% of men have experienced sexual harassment or abuse, most commonly inappropriate touching.\n\nIn the Islamic Republic of Iran, Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a message stating the “disaster of countless sexual assaults on Western women — including incidents leading to #Metoo campaign” can be solved with the Islamic solution of compulsory hijab.\n\nThe use of the #MeToo hashtag on social media spread quickly in India, where sexual harassment is commonly referred to by the word 'eve-teasing', a term described as misleading, tame, and diluting the seriousness of the crime. In response to #MeToo, there have been attempts to teach Indian women about workplace rights and safe reporting, as well as educate men about the scope of the problem. Some have likened #MeToo to a 2012 social movement which followed a violent gang rape in New Delhi that later resulted in a woman's death, which caused the Indian government to institute harsher punishments for rape. Others have suggested there was underlying public anger over a Delhi rape conviction that was overturned by Judge Ashutosh Kumar a month before against filmmaker and writer Mahmood Farooqui, ruling that a \"feeble\" no was not enough to revoke consent because it was typical for one partner to be less willing. The case is being appealed to the Supreme Court. Activist Jasmeen Patheja, head of Blank Noise, stated #MeToo's power is in demonstrating India can no longer ignore the scope of the problem. Kaimini Jaiswal, a lawyer at the Supreme Court of India, stressed the importance of teaching women how to read, especially in rural villages, because most women in these areas are illiterate and completely financially and emotionally dependent on a male relative.\n\nBlogger Sheena Dabholkar's viral #MeToo tweet resulted in the boycott of Khodu Irani's popular Pune pub, High Spirits, by several well-known performers. Several women mentioned Mahesh Murthy, which initiated a police case in January 2018. The Trends Desk of The Indian Express wrote many Indian men are speaking up as a part of #MeToo, including discussions about consent and how some men are also abused. Rina Chandran of Reuters said #MeToo is ignoring the 600,000 women in India who are currently involuntary sex workers, and are typically poor, uneducated or lack a family.\n\nThere were reports of mass sexual assaults during the 2018 new year's celebrations in Bangalore, which have been associated with #MeToo. The incidents were initially dismissed by the police until someone uploaded CCTV footage of the assaults to social media. Home Minister G. Parameshwara, Abu Azmi, and other officials came under fire for stating \"western\" women's clothing and values were the cause of the rapes and that women's families should not allow them to go to parties or major celebrations.\n\nSeveral lists of alleged rapists and harassers started spreading on social media in India, including \"The List\" which initially included the names of about sixty highly-respected academic men. The List of Sexual Harassers in Academia (\"LoSHA\") was posted on October 24, 2017 by activist Inji Pennu and an Indian student in California named Raya Sarkar, who alleged they personally confirmed every incident. This list has resulted in criticism against #MeToo because the allegations were unverified before they started spreading on social media. Some of the victims from the list have come forward to explain they were ignored, mistreated or retaliated against when they tried to pursue action. Sarkar has defended The List, saying that she posted it only to warn her friends about professors and academics to avoid (mostly upper caste men), and had no idea it could become so popular. A second list came out a week later that was made by women from a lower caste background and included more names, raising the total to around 70.\n\nTwelve prominent Indian feminists dismissed The List in a formal letter, saying they understand that the justice system is typically tilted against victims, but unverified claims make things harder for the feminist movement. Writers Rhea Dangwal and Namrata Gupta responded that most victims from the list were poor students who tried to go through official channels without success or recourse, while every single man on the list has the ability to defend himself socially and legally.\n\nOn September 27, 2018, former actress Tanushree Dutta accused Nana Patekar of sexual harassment, which was the catalyst of the \"Me Too\" movement in India. The accusation by Dutta stirred a row of accusations from many women in industries including media and politics. In October 2018, the Minister of state for External Affairs, MJ Akbar was accused of sexual harassment by several female colleagues through the 'Me Too' Movement in India.\n\nOn October 21, 2018, former music director Anu Malik was suspended from the jury panel of Indian Idol 2018, after facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment made through the movement. \n\nIn Israel, the Hebrew hashtag (#UsToo) began trending on October 18, 2017, with a front page spread in the newspaper . Asi Levi said at the Ophir Award ceremony that unlike America, in Israel the status of those accused do not change. A hashtag for men, #HowIWillChange, has also become popular.\n\n or (#MeToo) has also been used by Palestinian women from refugee camps.\n\nIn Italy, women posted stories of assault and harassment under the hashtag , which translates literally as \"TheTimeThat\". The phrase was launched by the journalist . Italian journalist wrote in \"The Washington Post\" that the initially popular movement quickly died out in Italy. She stated that Italian politician and former Prime Minister , who is known for his role in wild parties (Bunga Bunga bacchanals) with underage women and prostitutes, has contributed to a strong sexist culture with few female politicians in positions of power. Movie directors and were accused of harassment by more than a dozen women but did not face any significant consequences or media scrutiny.\n\n\"The New York Times\" described the movement in Italy as \"Meh\" due to the lack of discussion. , the president of the lower house of Parliament, has declared that the movement cannot touch Italy because although there is much harassment, victims are often silenced and there's also a belief that \"in our country, there are no harassers\". It has been reported that nearly 70% of female university students have been sexually harassed, and it is widely accepted that Italy is behind other countries when it comes to gender rights. In response to , one article from was titled, \"First they put out, then they whine and pretend to regret it.\"\n\nItalian , an employee and friend of Harvey Weinstein, was widely covered by the media after he was accused of allegations that he aided Weinstein in sexually harassing Italian actress and former model , though he denies all wrongdoing. said of Italy, \"Nothing has changed\", and described her life after going public with the allegations as living a nightmare. She has made plans to leave Italy. Conservative TV news editor criticized for being an accomplice to Weinstein for not reporting him immediately, and several other public figures and politicians questioned her innocence.\n\nThe group (Not One Woman Less), which is dedicated to stopping violence against women, wrote a letter in support of and organised a protest in November 2017 where tens of thousands of people gathered in Rome. Blogger (I Break Down Walls), journalist , (literally, \"Loose Bitches\"), and author also strongly supported publicly. Italian women's rights activist has stated that it is taken for granted that women must give or sell their body in order to get high-profile positions in politics, film, and media.\n\n, a politician who has created governmental initiatives aimed at teaching women it's okay to say no to sexual advances, has been targeted in the news and on social media for her support of the movement. She has been impersonated in several fake interviews where the actresses portray in unflattering ways. There are also photoshopped images of that have been shared widely on social media, including a doctored image with her underwear showing during her swearing-in ceremony, which never occurred. , the chair of the Commission of Inquiry into Femicide in Italy, said that one women is killed every two days on average by male violence, and the problem is severely under-reported, though credited the hashtag and the work by for making a positive difference.\n\nAlthough the #MeToo movement started out relatively small in Japan, it appears to be picking up steam. There is evidence that just 4% of rape victims in Japan report the crime, and the charges are dropped about half the time. BuzzFeed Japan has started a #MeToo page featuring articles about the movement in Japan. Journalist and author Shiori Ito published an article in Politico about the state of #MeToo in Japan. She has stated, \"It's not that victims haven't come forward; Japanese society wants them to stay silent.\" Two famous authors, Kyoko Nakajima and Mayumi Mori, have written in Asahi newspaper with criticism of Japan's silence on this matter. Takumi Harimaya wrote about the #MeToo movement in BuzzFeed Japan, stating she believes it could make a difference if the idea spreads, and sharing stories of victims, including what happened to popular blogger Hakuo Au (née Haruka Ito) at the hands of Mr Kishi Yuki. Other writers such as Kirsten King and Akiko Kobayashi have shared their #MeToo stories to Japanese audiences.\n\nHarimaya writes how the #MeToo movement has shown several women that they are not alone as they feared, and that many women are experiencing the same sexual violence and harassment. Keiko Kojima of Buzzfeed Japan says that #MeToo is needed in Japan because sexual harassment is baked into Japanese society, and the movement is about the fact that it is okay to say no to sexual violence. She said growing up that she felt getting molested on the train was an unavoidable as mosquito bites in the summer, and she hopes that #MeToo gives more victims the ability to find their voice, including male victims. She says that, despite how it is attacked in Japanese media, that #MeToo is not an \"anti-man\" campaign, it is simply about anti-violence and anti-harassment. She also believes it is extremely important for men to call out behaviors in others such as sexual harassment or having sex with someone who is unconscious. Therefore, every person who is not committing sexual violence is part of the #MeToo movement, whether they are male or female.\n\nShiori Ito notes that the word \"rape\" is taboo in Japan, and is typically described with less threatening words such as saying an underage victim was \"tricked\" or a woman was \"violated\" to describe what happened, which Ito says contributes to the public not understanding the full extent of the problem. The legal age of consent in Japan is 13. She says women in Japan are regularly exposed to harassment from a young age, and recalls being groped by a man at a swimming pool when she was 10 only to be blamed herself for wearing a \"cute bikini\". She states that harassment on public transportation is commonplace, and she remembers dealing with it every day in high school.\n\nAs part of the #MeToo movement, went public alleging that she was raped by , a prominent TV journalist and acquaintance of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, an admission she says was unthinkable for a woman to do in Japan. Yamaguchi rejects her accusations, and says that sex was consensual. She said her experience with Japan's legal system showed her that victims of sex crimes were undermined and ignored. She called for the Japanese parliament to update Japan's laws regarding rape, which were over a century old. She explains how she could not get information on which hospital provides rape kits without going through a preliminary interview in person. When she went to the police, she was discouraged from filing a report, and informed her career would be ruined for no reason if she did this. She was told she did not act like a victim, and had to be interviewed by several officers, including one who made her reenact the rape with a dummy while he took pictures. Although they initially said they would arrest Yamaguchi, the case and charges were unexpectedly dropped. Ito then went to the media, but no one would take her story. When she spoke about the experience at a press conference, she made national news and immediately started receiving a negative backlash, hate mail, and threats. She has been unsuccessful in her attempts to have criminal charges brought against Yamaguchi, but as of 2018 she was still pursuing a civil case against him, which he was defending.\n\nIn 2018, Junichi Fukuda, a deputy finance minister in the Abe Administration, resigned after being accused of sexual harassment by his former subordinates.\n\nWhen #MeToo first went viral in October 2017, coverage was overshadowed in Kenya by a presidential election that was occurring the next week. However, the #MeToo movement started slowly spreading in Kenya after the election was over. In January 2018, it became especially popular after several new mothers alleged sexual misconduct at Kenyatta National Hospital, claiming that after giving birth they have been sexually assaulted when they went alone to breastfeed. There were also allegations that children in the hospital have been sexually assaulted. The hospital announced that the women were all lying, but in the future, women should stay together in groups in the hospital to prevent sexual assault. In response, hundreds of people began protesting in the streets of in Nairobi, Kenya, and an investigation was initiated by the health minister.\nFormer Mayor of Kathmandu, Keshav Sthapit has been accused of sexual harassment by two female office clerks of the Kathmandu Metropolitan Office, Rashmila Prajapati and Ujjwala Maharjan, as a part of the Me Too movement in Nepal.\n\nNigerian women and children get sexually assaulted every day and do not speak up about it due to fear of stigmatisation and prejudice. Official silence seems to surround sexual abuse of women in Nigeria, with the police frequently not taking sexual abuse reports seriously. As a result, men, who are often the perpetrators of sexual abuse go unchallenged, and unpunished owing to factors such as culture and popular beliefs. The custom of victim blaming is evident in testimonies rape and sexual abuse survivors. Nigerian cultures look down on the open discussions of sexual matters and desires. A great deal of the pressure to remain silent stems from socio-cultural values, customs and expectations about what constitutes socially accepted behaviours. Cultural socialisation recognises men as having a naturally stronger sexual drive, and speaks of women in terms of shame, lack of interest in sexual matters and as the to be conquered by a domineering man. Nigerians are socially nurtured and fed by oppressive patriarchal subjectivities that try to instil a sense of what is normal: sexually-speaking.\n\nThere is a factor of power influencing the slow growth of the movement in Nigeria. The country is a highly patriarchal society. Women have complained of how unimaginable it is in the country to report cases of harassment. Yet, sexual harassment is so prominent within the country that it is perceived as almost a right to men.\n\nShe had been assaulted three times by three different men. The first incident took place at age five. At that time, she was too young to understand what happened until she turned 18 when she encountered a similar incident again. She was at a party when a stranger forced her to have sex with him. Upon her refusal, he beat her up and raped her. Due to the stigma attached to being raped, she resorted to silence. The final experience took place at her workplace when her boss forcibly put his hand under her skirt. She still remained silent with the notion of not being believed and being judged by others. Realizing she could not remain silent and needed to make an impact, Uphopho currently works with her husband to break the \"culture of silence\" around abuse in Nigeria. They produced a play called \"Shattered\" which seeks to encourage victims of sexual abuse to speak up.\n\nIn Norway, under the hashtag \"#stilleforopptak\" (en. SilentforRecording), almost 600 actresses signed a petition and shared their stories through \"Aftenposten\" on November 16, 2017. This also inspired dancers and musicians to create their own petitions, \"#nårdansenstopper\" (en. WhentheDanceStops) signed by 792 dancers, and \"#nårmusikkenstilner\" (en. WhentheMusicQuiets) signed by over 1110 musicians.\n\n, the deputy leader of the Norwegian Labour Party and a former cabinet minister in Norway, resigned from his political positions on January 7, 2018 after being accused of an extensive pattern of sexual assault and sexual harassment of young women, and of taking advantage of his political positions to make unwanted sexual advances. The accusations came in the context of the Me Too debate and dominated Norwegian media for several weeks from December 2017. Accusations towards the now former leader of the Norwegian Young Conservatives, , also saw the light of day. In a Facebook post, wrote: \"I have been confronted with the fact that members of the Norwegian Young Conservatives on several occasions have reacted to my behaviour.\" It would later be revealed that the Conservative Party had received 15 alerts, whereas 10 of them regarded . , Norwegian politician for the Progress Party and member of the , had to take a break from office after it was discovered that he had shared pornographic images with a 14-year-old member of the Progress Party's Youth in addition to suggesting a threesome between him, a 30-year-old woman and a 15-year-old member of the Progress Party's Youth.\n\nAfter the death of 7-year-old Zainab Ansari in January 2018, who was raped and killed, there began a wave of declarations on Pakistan social media in #MeToo style. Sexual assault against minor in Pakistan will result in 14 to 20 year in prison and a fine of 1 millions rupees. Sheema Kermani, a classical dancer, has been called the leader of the Pakistan #MeToo movement. Former model Frieha Altaf and designer Maheem Khan shared stories of sexual abuse, and challenged Pakistan to be more proactive at stopping children from getting raped.\n\nProtests marked the premieres of \"Teefa in Trouble\" in Karachi and Lahore by activists who boycotted the film over the sexual harassment allegations leveled against Ali Zafar by Meesha Shafi, as well as at least half a dozen other women, earlier in the year. Zafar categorically denied the allegations and sued Shafi for defamation in the court where the case is ongoing. On the other hand, Shafi had also filed a harassment case against Zafar, which, itself, is an ongoing investigation.\n\nWith hashtags such as #BoycottAliZafar, #BoycottTeefainTrouble, and #TeefaisTrouble, a huge wave of activists built a momentum on social media ahead of the movie's premiere and subsequent screenings. A few major Pakistani media outlets outright ignored the demonstrations but other had to give in when protestors turned up at cinemas and police and other law enforcement agencies got involved.\n\nZafar reportedly also had to avoid his grand arrival at the film’s Karachi premiere and take a detour through the basement at Nueplex Cinemas in DHA, Karachi, in order to avoid the hoard of demonstrators who had gathered at the venue’s main entrance. During the protest, Feroze Khan, an actor and Zafar’s friend, returned from inside the cinema in an attempt to sway the protestors by telling them to support “Pakistani cinema”; however, he was turned away owing to his stance, to which he responded by making obscene gestures.\n\nReports had also emerged that the Nueplex Cinemas’ security manhandled some of the demonstrators and verbally abused multiple people at the protest.\n\nProtestors again showed up at Lahore’s CineStar for voice their anger and disappointment at both the promotion of the film of an alleged harasser and the celebrities pouring in to support him. The controversy deepened when, in one instance, the demonstrators asked Waleed Zaman, the creative director of women’s clothing brand Kayseria, the reason why he was backing the film, to which Zaman responded by saying: “We support sexual harassment of women.”\n\nZaman later posted and deleted multiple apologies on his social media accounts.\n\nAt yet another screening of the film at Nueplex Cinemas at Rashid Minhas Road, Karachi, protestors were allegedly held in the basement and beaten by the cinema’s private security, with various media reports confirming the incident. The demonstrators’ phones were also confiscated and the cinema's security allegedly tried to plant incriminating evidence in one of the protestors' bags in order to make their case appear stronger to police. However, they were let go later after the arrival of Rangers personnel.\n\nAt least four women leveled allegations of sexual misconduct against Junaid Akram, a prominent stand-up comedian and vlogger. Most of the accusers were girls in their teens and early twenties. Akram, too, denied \"all allegations of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct\", labeled them \"false\", and announced that he intended to pursue legal actions as he had \"already met my legal team\".\n\nAkram also clarified that his \"marital status is public information\".\n\nThe son of world-renowned late philanthropist Abdul Sattar Edhi, Faisal Edhi, who now heads the Edhi Foundation, was also accused of sexual misconduct by a former journalist., who said the man \"grabbed my hand tightly and tried to kind of pull me back into the van\". Faisal Edhi has denied the claims.\n\nThe Me Too movement has slowly picked in in the Philippines. In the culture of the Philippines, shaming and victim blaming are still present. They are afraid to say #MeToo because people do not believe them. Stories finally began to come about after actress Saab Magalona retweeted Alyssa Milano’s infamous quote. The accusations revolved around the entertainment industry as one of the bands, Jensen and the Flips was being brought up and they acknowledged their mistakes and apologized for their misconduct. Statistics from the Philippine Commission on Women from 2004 to 2013 revealed that only 629 cases had been recorded with the Philippine national police’s Women and Children Protection Center. This figure is believed to only be a fraction of the actual number of harassment offenses committed against women. While the movement has not been as big as in the U.S., other movements such as #BabaeAko have started as a result of #MeToo. #BabaeAko translates to “I am Women” and began in May after President Rodrigo Duterte declared that the next Chief Justice of Philippines could not be a woman. \n\nIn South Korea, the Me Too movement started to gain momentum as public prosecutor Seo Ji-hyeon shared her experience of assault by a high-level prosecutor and oppression of government authorities on national television on January 29, 2018. As part of her interview, Seo claimed that she was sexually assaulted by then Korean Ministry of Justice Policy Planning Director and former prosecutor Ahn Tae-geun at a funeral in 2010. She reported the activity to her superiors, however, her superiors covered up the incident and demoted her to Changwon Public Prosecutor's Office from her post in Seoul, in spite the fact that she was highly praised and awarded for her work performance by her superiors prior to the incident.\n\nAfter Seo's public admittance of sexual assault, the Me Too movement spread quickly to other areas of society. On February 13, 2018, several women, including former actress Kim Soo-hee and actress Hong Seon-joo, accused Lee Yountaek, a prominent and critically acclaimed stage director, of sexual harassment. Lee allegedly forced many women in his theater troupe, for 18 years, to massage his genital area prior to raping them. In addition, Kim Soo-hee stated that in 2005, Lee raped her and got her pregnant, for which she had an abortion. Moreover, actress Hong Seon-joo alleged that Lee forcibly penetrated her private part with sticks and wooden chopsticks, saying it will help her vocalization. As a result, Lee resigned from all his positions in the theater world and formally apologized to the victims. Lee admitted to all his crimes except the abortion.\nOn February 22, 2018, actor Oh Dal-su was accused of sexual harassment, for which he denied the accusation. However, February 26, further accusations against Oh were broadcast on \"JTBC Newsroom\", during which an interview was conducted with the woman who had accused Oh of sexual harassment and sexual assault. Moreover, on February 27's episode of JTBC's \"Newsroom\", actress Uhm Ji-young came forward to say that she was also sexually harassed by Oh in 2003. As a result, Oh pulled out of his upcoming TV series \"My Mister\".\n\nAlso on February 22, 2018, students in Cheongju University in Korea divulged the long-time crimes of professor and actor, Jo Min-ki. At first, he denied his crimes and dismissed them as rumors. However, as many other students, including fellow male students accusing him of such exploitation, he admitted to the allegations and apologized publicly. It was confirmed that Jo would be investigated by the police. On March 9, 2018, Jo committed suicide following his scandal, which in turn triggered backlash against the Me Too movement in South Korea.\n\nOn February 23, 2018, actress Choi Yul accused actor Cho Jae-hyun of assaulting her sexually. On February 24, Cho acknowledged the accusations.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, Ko Un, one of South Korea's most iconic and prominent poets and frequently mentioned Nobel laureate shortlist candidate, was also accused of sexual assault. First reported by the Dong-A Ilbo, poet Choi Young-mi's poem 'The Beast' suggests sexual assault by Ko approximately 20 years ago. The poem did not explicitly mention Ko, but the details of the frequently mentioned \"En\", which bears similarities to Ko's name - Ko Un - highly matches the accused poet's past. It also confirms the constant rumors and allegations that has been circulating in the past years that Ko has been using his privilege as a prominent poet to gain sexual advances and favors. As a result, Ko was pulled from textbooks and critically denounced by fellow literaries alike. Ko also resigned from various posts that he held, including his professorship at KAIST. On March 2, 2018 Ko offered his statement to The Guardian through UK publishers Bloodaxe Books, writing that \"he had ‘done nothing which might bring shame on my wife or myself.\" Despite the denial, more allegations are emerging against Ko.\n\nAs more public figures are being denounced across society, there has been an increased number of celebrities accused of unwanted sexual advances and activities in the Korean television and cinematic industries, including Choi Il-hwa and Kim Heung-gook.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, prominent Democratic Party of Korea presidential contender and former Chungcheongnam-do province Governor Ahn Hee-jung resigned from the governorship and announced his retirement from public service, as his former secretary Kim Ji-eun accused him of multiple cases of sexual assault. She claims that Ahn assaulted her multiple times and said that there is more than one victim inside the Governor's office. Ahn admitted about his sexual activity to his former secretary and apologized, however claimed that it was consensual. He was expelled from his party on the same day.\n\nA female executive of Hyundai resigned due to the movement.\n\nThe Spanish-language counterpart is . In Spain, on October 25 several Spanish actresses recognized in a report the existence of sexual harassment in Spanish cinema, among them , , , and . Also explaining cases of harassment suffered by them were the actress, scriptwriter and film director and . The Me Too movement found an echo in the ongoing uproar raised by La Manada case, crystallizing in numerous protests across the country.\n\nIn Sweden, several women used the hashtag to confront television presenter , whose shows on TV4 were cancelled on October 20, 2017, and journalist 's alleged abuse towards them. Carl XVI Gustaf, king of Sweden, said #MeToo is a positive movement that is good for society, and urged victims to come forward and share their stories.\n\nGender studies scholar and legal scholar wrote that the Swedish journalistic profession bore a large part of the blame in Sweden for the problems the Me Too debate had highlighted because Swedish journalists had systematically attacked critical discussion of and research on men's violence against women for over 20 years. Ellinor Skagegård in the Swedish newspaper wrote that during the Me Too campaign, it looks as if Lundgren was right in her research on men's violence against women.\n\nIn the wake of #MeToo, a Labour activist shared her 2011 story of being raped by a senior person in the Labour Party, but being warned that her career could be damaged if she reported the incident. In the UK, the Cabinet Office has launched an investigation in allegations that Parliament member Mark Garnier ordered a secretary to buy sex toys for his wife and mistress.\n\nA series of allegations concerning the involvement of British politicians in cases of sexual harassment and assault arose in October and November 2017, the 2017 Westminster sexual scandals. Allegations were prompted by discussions among junior staff employed in the UK Parliament at Westminster following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations in Hollywood earlier in October, and the subsequent rise of Me Too. The journalists Jane Merrick and Kate Maltby made allegations against the Defence Minister Michael Fallon and de facto Deputy Prime Minister Damian Green, respectively. These led to the departures of both from Theresa May's cabinet, the latter after a two-month inquiry that also considered allegations that Green had lied about copious amounts of pornography found on his parliamentary computer. Both Merrick and Maltby cited the #MeToo movement as inspiring their allegations.\n\nRape statistics (2016-2017) from Rape Crisis Centers across England and Wales unfolds that every year, about 85,000 women and 12,000 men become victims of rape. \n\nIn January 2018, Channel 4 News's Cathy Newman conducted an interview on Canadian professor of psychology Jordan Peterson. Newman was criticized for the interview and Rachael Revesz of \"The Independent\" wrote that subsequent abuse targeted at Newman was a symbol of a backlash against the MeToo movement.\n\n"}

The attack was unsuccessful.\n\nIn 1439, King Sigismund of Hungary argued with King Wladislaw of Poland about dividing Moldavia between their two countries. Sigismund complained that the Moldavians refused to aid him in his expeditions against the Turks, but King Wladyslaw argued that the Moldavians couldn't aid Sigismund with troops because they aided him, instead, and Sigismund had to give up on his claims. \n\nIn 1444, Moldavia sent troops that joined King Władysław III of Varna at the Battle of Varna. The Turks had camels with them and in case of defeat, they would spill gold and silver coins on the ground in order to slacken the enemy. The Moldavians went after the camels for the money. \n\nBetween 1451 and 1457, Moldavia was in civil turmoil and under Petru Aron, the principality paid the Porte an annual tribute of 2,000,000 gold coins. In 1470, during the rule of Stephen the Great, the relationship between Moldavia and the Porte became hostile, and resulted in several confrontations, most notable being the Battle of Vaslui, where the Ottomans were heavily defeated, and the Battle of Valea Albă, where Mehmed II was victorious, but was forced to retreat. In 1484, the Ottomans managed to annex Chilia and Akkerman. After 1504, Moldavia fell into decline and was forced to accept vassalage for the Porte, but conflicts continued to rage until the 19th century, giving the country brief periods of independence.\n\n"}

In some parts of the country the day is still celebrated. It has also been known as Shick Shack Day, or Oak and Nettle Day.\n\nIn 1660, Parliament passed into law \"An Act for a Perpetual Anniversary Thanksgiving on the Nine and Twentieth Day of May\", declaring 29 May a public holiday \"for keeping of a perpetual Anniversary, for a Day of Thanksgiving to God, for the great Blessing and Mercy he hath been graciously pleased to vouchsafe to the People of these Kingdoms, after their manifold and grievous Sufferings, in the Restoration of his Majesty...\"\n\nThe public holiday was formally abolished in the Anniversary Days Observance Act 1859, but the date retains some significance in local or institutional customs. It is, for example, still observed as Founder's Day by the Royal Hospital Chelsea, which was founded by Charles II in 1681.\n\nTraditional celebrations to commemorate the event often entailed the wearing of oak apples (a type of plant gall, possibly known in some parts of the country as a \"shick-shack\") or sprigs of oak leaves, in reference to the occasion after the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, when Charles II escaped the Roundhead army by hiding in an oak tree near Boscobel House. Anyone who failed to wear a sprig of oak risked being pelted with bird's eggs or thrashed with nettles. In Sussex, those not wearing oak were liable to be pinched, giving rise to the unofficial name of \"Pinch- Day\"; similarly it was known as \"Bumping Day\" in Essex.\n\nIn Upton Grey, Hampshire, after the church bells had been rung at 6 am the bell-ringers used to place a large branch of oak over the church porch, and another over the lych gate. Smaller branches were positioned in the gateway of every house to ensure good luck for the rest of the year.\n\nEvents still take place at Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire, Marsh Gibbon in Buckinghamshire, Great Wishford in Wiltshire (when villagers gather wood in Grovely Wood), and Membury in Devon. The day is generally marked by re-enactment activities at Moseley Old Hall, West Midlands, one of the houses where Charles II hid in 1651.\n\nAt Fownhope in Herefordshire the Heart of Oak Society organize an annual event, where members of the society gather at the local pub and march through the village holding flower and oak leaf decorated sticks, whilst following the society banner and a brass band. The march goes first to the church for a service, and then to houses who host refreshments. The Heart of Oak Society was previously a friendly society, but had to reform in 1989 to keep the tradition going. Although Oak Apple Day celebrations have decreased in popularity and knowledge, Fownhope has managed to keep the event going, increasing in popularity and turn-out every year.\n\nAt All Saints' Church, Northampton, a statue of Charles II is garlanded with oak leaves at noon every Oak Apple Day, followed by a celebration of the Holy Communion according to the \"Book of Common Prayer\".\n\nOak Apple Day is also celebrated in the Cornish village of St Neot. The vicar leads a procession through the village, he is followed by the Tower Captain holding the Oak bough. A large number of the villagers follow walking to the Church. A story of the history of the event is told and then the vicar blesses the branch. The Tower Captain throws the old branch down from the top of the tower and a new one is hauled to the top. Everyone is then invited to the vicarage gardens for refreshments and a barbecue. Up to 12 noon villagers wear a sprig of \"red\" (new) oak and in the afternoon wear a sprig of \"Boys Love\" (\"Artemisia abrotanum\"); tradition dictates that the punishment for not doing this results in being stung by nettles.\n\n\n"}

Edgar Savisaar introduced the idea of popular front during a TV show on 13 April 1988. The idea was developed through the year and finally The Estonian Popular Front was established on 1 October 1988 with a massively crowded congress which turned to a culmination of the first phase of the Singing Revolution.\n\nIt was to a significant degree the precursor to the current Estonian Centre Party, although with a much broader base of popularity at the beginning.\n\nThe Popular Front of Estonia was a major force in the Estonian independence movement that led to the re-establishment of the Republic of Estonia as a country independent from the Soviet Union. It was similar to the Popular Front of Latvia and the Sąjūdis movement in Lithuania and a number of Popular Fronts that were created almost simultaneously in many parts of the USSR. The Baltic States were in a unique category among the constituent parts of the USSR in that they had been European parliamentary democracies in the interbellum and had been annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. The Popular Front of Estonia was founded in 1988 by Marju Lauristin and Edgar Savisaar. Savisaar initiated the founding in April 1988 in a live broadcast (\"Mõtleme veel\") on Estonian TV, advocating support of Gorbachevian perestroika.\n\nPopular Front organised series of much-crowded and well-published events and actions which stressed on Estonian national pride but on democratic values as well. Huge amount of prints and newspapers were produced to popularise PF movement. The top-leaders and sub-leaders of PF were everyday guests in every kind of media to talk about several kind of problems and ideas. Popular Front of Estonia made ideas of independent Estonia acceptable and possible for masses. The idea of independence had become a somewhat impossible and unbelievable dream for the majority of Estonians during decades under the Soviet Union.\n\nAt one point someway problematic character of Edgar Savisaar created growing opposition against PF among Estonians too. Those people formed their own smaller organisations which grew into important element of politics of independent Estonia next decade.\n\nThe Popular Front of Estonia together with the Popular Front of Latvia and the Sąjūdis organised the Baltic Way mass \"arm-in-arm\" manifestation extending through three Baltic states on 23 August 1989 that marked 50th anniversary of 23 August 1939, when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which resulted in the forcible incorporation of these three states into the Soviet Union and the loss of their independence. The front was opposed by the Intermovement that represented the pro-Soviet part of Estonia's ethnic Russian minority and other ethnic groups that had been settled in Estonia during the Soviet occupation period. The Popular Front was a supporter of perestroika, while the Intermovement was seen as opposed to Gorbachev's reforms. As time went by, an ever-greater chasm developed between the initial thrust of the Popular Front, leading members of which at first advocated mere autonomy within a Soviet system that Gorbachev was trying to reform in a cautious way, and the eventual context of the Estonian Popular Front, which came to stand for true independence, an idea supported by the rank and file. Consequently, the Estonian Popular Front changed a great deal over time, until political parties came to replace such movements in Estonia during the early nineties. This rendered the Popular Front of Estonia an anachronism, and Popular Front was dissolved in 1993.\n\n\n"}

Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard side and opened five of her sixteen compartments to the sea. \"Titanic\" had been designed to stay afloat with four of her forward compartments flooded but no more, and the crew soon realised that the ship would sink. They used distress flares and radio (wireless) messages to attract help as the passengers were put into lifeboats. In accordance with existing practice, \"Titanic\"s lifeboat system was designed to ferry passengers to nearby rescue vessels, not to hold everyone on board simultaneously; therefore, with the ship sinking rapidly and help still hours away, there was no safe refuge for many of the passengers and crew. Compounding this, poor management of the evacuation meant many boats were launched before they were completely full.\n\nAs a result, when \"Titanic\" sank, over a thousand passengers and crew were still on board. Almost all those who jumped or fell into the water either drowned or died within minutes due to the effects of cold shock and incapacitation. arrived on the scene about an hour and a half after the sinking and rescued the last of the survivors by 09:15 on 15 April, some nine and a half hours after the collision. The disaster shocked the world and caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of the three passenger classes during the evacuation. Subsequent inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today.\n\nAt the time of her entry into service on 2 April 1912, Royal Mail Ship (RMS) \"Titanic\" was the second of three sister ships, and was the largest ship in the world. She and her sister, , were almost one and a half times the gross register tonnage of Cunard's and , the previous record holders, and were nearly longer. \"Titanic\" could carry 3,547 people in speed and comfort, and was built on a hitherto unprecedented scale. Her reciprocating engines were the largest that had ever been built, standing high and with cylinders in diameter requiring the burning of of coal per day.\n\nHer passenger accommodation, especially the First Class section, was said to be \"of unrivalled extent and magnificence\", indicated by the fares that First Class accommodation commanded. The Parlour Suites (the most expensive and most luxurious suites on the ship) with private promenade cost over for a one-way transatlantic passage. Even Third Class, though considerably less luxurious than Second and First Classes, was unusually comfortable by contemporary standards and was supplied with plentiful quantities of good food, providing its passengers with better conditions than many of them had experienced at home.\n\n\"Titanic\"s maiden voyage began shortly after noon on 10 April 1912 when she left Southampton on the first leg of her journey to New York. A few hours later she called at Cherbourg in northern France, a journey of , where she took on passengers. Her next port of call was Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland, which she reached around midday on 11 April. She left in the afternoon after taking on more passengers and stores.\n\nBy the time she departed westwards across the Atlantic she was carrying 892 crew members and 1,320 passengers. This was only about half of her full passenger capacity of 2,435, as it was the low season and shipping from the UK had been disrupted by a coal miners' strike. Her passengers were a cross-section of Edwardian society, from millionaires such as John Jacob Astor and Benjamin Guggenheim, to poor emigrants from countries as disparate as Armenia, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Syria and Russia seeking a new life in America.\nThe ship was commanded by 62-year-old Captain Edward John Smith, the most senior of the White Star Line's captains. He had four decades of seafaring experience and had served as captain of , from which he was transferred to command \"Titanic\". The vast majority of the crew who served under him were not trained sailors, but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines; or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers. The six watch officers and 39 able seamen constituted only around five percent of the crew, and most of these had been taken on at Southampton so had not had time to familiarise themselves with the ship.\n\nThe ice conditions were attributed to a mild winter that caused large numbers of icebergs to shift off the west coast of Greenland.\n\nA fire had begun in one of \"Titanic\"s coal bunkers approximately 10 days prior to the ship's departure, and continued to burn for several days into the voyage, but it was over on 14 April. The weather improved significantly during the course of the day, from brisk winds and moderate seas in the morning to a crystal-clear calm by evening, as the ship's path took it beneath an arctic high pressure system.\n\nThe waning crescent moon had set a few seconds after 15:00 on 14 April and would not rise again until 04:37 (ship's time) on 15 April, shortly after the arrival of the \"Carpathia\".\n\nOn 14 April 1912, \"Titanic\"s radio operators received six messages from other ships warning of drifting ice, which passengers on \"Titanic\" had begun to notice during the afternoon. The ice conditions in the North Atlantic were the worst for any April in the previous 50 years (which was the reason why the lookouts were unaware that they were about to steam into a line of drifting ice several miles wide and many miles long). Not all of these messages were relayed by the radio operators. At the time, all wireless operators on ocean liners were employees of the Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company and not members of their ship's crew; their primary responsibility was to send messages for the passengers, with weather reports as a secondary concern.\n\nThe first warning came at 09:00 from reporting \"bergs, growlers and field ice\". Captain Smith acknowledged receipt of the message. At 13:42, relayed a report from the Greek ship \"Athenia\" that she had been \"passing icebergs and large quantities of field ice\". This too was acknowledged by Smith, who showed the report to J. Bruce Ismay, the chairman of the White Star Line, aboard \"Titanic\" for her maiden voyage. Smith ordered a new course to be set, to take the ship farther south.\n\nAt 13:45, the German ship SS \"Amerika\", which was a short distance to the south, reported she had \"passed two large icebergs\". This message never reached Captain Smith or the other officers on \"Titanic\"s bridge. The reason is unclear, but it may have been forgotten because the radio operators had to fix faulty equipment.\n\nAlthough the crew was aware of ice in the vicinity, they did not reduce the ship's speed, and continued to steam at , only short of her maximum speed of . \"Titanic\"s high speed in waters where ice had been reported was later criticised as reckless, but it reflected standard maritime practice at the time. According to Fifth Officer Harold Lowe, the custom was \"to go ahead and depend upon the lookouts in the crow's nest and the watch on the bridge to pick up the ice in time to avoid hitting it\".\n\nThe North Atlantic liners prioritised time-keeping above all other considerations, sticking rigidly to a schedule that would guarantee their arrival at an advertised time. They were frequently driven at close to their full speed, treating hazard warnings as advisories rather than calls to action. It was widely believed that ice posed little risk; close calls were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, , a German liner, had rammed an iceberg and suffered a crushed bow, but was still able to complete her voyage. That same year, \"Titanic\"s future captain, Edward Smith, declared in an interview that he could not \"imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\"\n\nAs \"Titanic\" approached her fatal collision, most passengers had gone to bed and command of the bridge had passed from Second Officer Charles Lightoller to First Officer William Murdoch. Lookouts Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee were occupying the crow's nest, above the deck. The air temperature had fallen to near freezing, and the ocean was completely calm. Colonel Archibald Gracie, one of the survivors of the disaster, later wrote that \"the sea was like glass, so smooth that the stars were clearly reflected.\" It is now known that such exceptionally calm water is a sign of nearby pack ice.\n\nAlthough the air was clear, there was no moon, and with the sea so calm, there was nothing to give away the position of the nearby icebergs; had the sea been rougher, waves breaking against the icebergs would have made them more visible. Because of a mix-up at Southampton the lookouts had no binoculars; but reportedly binoculars would not have been effective in darkness which was total except for starlight and the ship's own lights. The lookouts were nonetheless well aware of the ice hazard, as Lightoller had ordered them and other crew members to \"keep a sharp look-out for ice, particularly small ice and growlers\".\n\nAt 23:30, Fleet and Lee noticed a slight haze on the horizon ahead of them, but did not make anything of it. Some experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when \"Titanic\" entered Iceberg Alley. This would have resulted in a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.\n\nNine minutes later, at 23:39, Fleet spotted an iceberg in \"Titanic\"s path. He rang the lookout bell three times and telephoned the bridge to inform Sixth Officer James Moody. Fleet asked \"Is there anyone there?\" Moody replied, \"Yes, what do you see?\" Fleet replied: \"Iceberg, right ahead!\" After thanking Fleet, Moody relayed the message to Murdoch, who ordered Quartermaster Robert Hichens to change the ship's course. Murdoch is generally believed to have given the order \"Hard astarboard\" which would result in the ship's tiller being moved all the way to starboard (the right side of the ship) in an attempt to turn the ship to port (left). He also rang \"Full Astern\" on the ship's telegraphs.\n\nAccording to Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, Murdoch told Captain Smith that he was attempting to \"hard-a-port around [the iceberg]\", suggesting that he was attempting a \"port around\" manoeuvre – to first swing the bow around the obstacle, then swing the stern so that both ends of the ship would avoid a collision. There was a delay before either order went into effect; the steam-powered steering mechanism took up to 30 seconds to turn the ship's tiller, and the complex task of setting the engines into reverse would also have taken some time to accomplish. Because the centre turbine could not be reversed, both it and the centre propeller, positioned directly in front of the ship's rudder, were stopped. This reduced the rudder's effectiveness, therefore impairing the turning ability of the ship. Had Murdoch turned the ship while maintaining her forward speed, \"Titanic\" might have missed the iceberg with feet to spare.\n\nIn 2010, Louise Patten asserted that her grandfather Charles Lightoller claimed that the helmsman Robert Hichens initially panicked and turned the rudder in the wrong direction and that subsequently Bruce Ismay ordered the boat to continue \"Slow Ahead\" in the belief that \"Titanic\" was unsinkable. This, allegedly, had never been revealed because of the insurance implications.\n\nIn the event, \"Titanic\"s heading changed just in time to avoid a head-on collision, but the change in direction caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice dislodged from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. About five minutes after the collision, all of \"Titanic\"s engines were stopped, leaving the bow of the ship facing north and slowly drifting south in the Labrador Current.\n\nThe impact with the iceberg was long thought to have produced a huge opening in \"Titanic\"s hull, \"not less than in length, above the level of the keel\", as one writer later put it. At the British inquiry following the accident, Edward Wilding (chief naval architect for Harland and Wolff), calculating on the basis of the observed flooding of forward compartments forty minutes after the collision, testified that the area of the hull opened to the sea was \"somewhere about 12 square feet\". He also stated that \"I believe it must have been in places, not a continuous rip\", but that the different openings must have extended along an area of around 300 feet, to account for the flooding in several compartments. The findings of the inquiry state that the damage extended about 300 feet, and hence many subsequent writers followed this statement. Modern ultrasound surveys of the wreck have found that the damage consisted of six narrow openings in an area of the hull covering only about in total. According to Paul K. Matthias, who made the measurements, the damage consisted of a \"series of deformations in the starboard side that start and stop along the hull ... about above the bottom of the ship\".\n\nThe gaps, the longest of which measures about long, appear to have followed the line of the hull plates. This suggests that the iron rivets along the plate seams snapped off or popped open to create narrow gaps through which water flooded. An engineer from \"Titanic\"s builders, Harland and Wolff, suggested this scenario at the British Wreck Commissioner's inquiry following the disaster but his view was discounted. \"Titanic\"s discoverer Robert Ballard has commented that the assumption that the ship had suffered a major breach was \"a by-product of the mystique of the \"Titanic\". No one could believe that the great ship was sunk by a little sliver.\" Faults in the ship's hull may have been a contributing factor. Recovered pieces of \"Titanic\"s hull plates appear to have shattered on impact with the iceberg, without bending.\n\nThe plates in the central 60% of the hull were held together with triple rows of mild steel rivets, but the plates in the bow and stern were held together with double rows of wrought iron rivets which were – according to materials scientists Tim Foecke and Jennifer McCarty – near their stress limits even before the collision. These \"Best\" or No. 3 iron rivets had a high level of slag inclusions, making them more brittle than the more usual \"Best-Best\" No. 4 iron rivets, and more prone to snapping when put under stress, particularly in extreme cold. But Tom McCluskie, a retired archivist of Harland & Wolff, pointed out that \"Olympic\", \"Titanic\"s sister ship, was riveted with the same iron and served without incident for nearly 25 years, surviving several major collisions, including being rammed by a British cruiser. When \"Olympic\" rammed and sank the U-boat with her bow, the stem was twisted and hull plates on the starboard side were buckled without impairing the hull's integrity.\n\nAbove the waterline, there was little evidence of the collision. The stewards in the first class dining room noticed a shudder, which they thought might have been caused by the ship shedding a propeller blade. Many of the passengers felt a bump or shudder – \"just as though we went over about a thousand marbles\", as one survivor put it – but did not know what had happened. Those on the lowest decks, nearest the site of the collision, felt it much more directly. Engine Oiler Walter Hurst recalled being \"awakened by a grinding crash along the starboard side. No one was very much alarmed but knew we had struck something\". Fireman George Kemish heard a \"heavy thud and grinding tearing sound\" from the starboard hull.\n\nThe ship began to flood immediately, with water pouring in at an estimated rate of per second, fifteen times faster than it could be pumped out. Second Engineer J. H. Hesketh and Leading Stoker Frederick Barrett were both struck by a jet of icy water in No. 6 boiler room and escaped just before the room's watertight door closed. This was an extremely dangerous situation for the engineering staff; the boilers were still full of hot high-pressure steam and there was a substantial risk that they would explode if they came into contact with the cold seawater flooding the boiler rooms. The stokers and firemen were ordered to reduce the fires and vent the boilers, sending great quantities of steam up the funnel venting pipes. They were waist-deep in freezing water by the time they finished their work.\n\n\"Titanic\"s lower decks were divided into sixteen compartments. Each compartment was separated from its neighbour by a bulkhead running the width of the ship; there were fifteen bulkheads in all. Each bulkhead extended at least to the underside of E Deck, nominally one deck, or about , above the waterline. The two nearest the bow and the six nearest the stern went one deck further up.\n\nEach bulkhead could be sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler rooms on the tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.\n\nAlthough the watertight bulkheads extended well above the water line, they were not sealed at the top. If too many compartments were flooded, the ship's bow would settle deeper in the water, and water would spill from one compartment to the next in sequence, rather like water spilling across the top of an ice cube tray. This was what happened to \"Titanic\", which had suffered damage to the forepeak tank, the three forward holds and No. 6 boiler room, a total of five compartments. \"Titanic\" was only designed to float with any two compartments flooded, but it could remain afloat with certain combinations of three or even four compartments (the first four) open to the ocean. With five compartments, the tops of the bulkheads would be submerged and the ship would continue to flood.\nCaptain Smith felt the collision in his cabin and immediately came to the bridge. Informed of the situation, he summoned Thomas Andrews, \"Titanic\"s builder, who was among a party of engineers from Harland and Wolff observing the ship's first passenger voyage. The ship was listing five degrees to starboard and was two degrees down by the head within a few minutes of the collision. Smith and Andrews went below and found that the forward cargo holds, the mail room and the squash court were flooded, while No. 6 boiler room was already filled to a depth of . Water was spilling over into No. 5 boiler room, and crewmen there were battling to pump it out.\n\nWithin 45 minutes of the collision, at least of water had entered the ship. This was far too much for \"Titanic\"s ballast and bilge pumps to handle; the total pumping capacity of all the pumps combined was only per hour. Andrews informed the captain that the first five compartments were flooded, and therefore \"Titanic\" was doomed. By his estimate, she could remain afloat for no longer than about two hours.\n\nFrom the time of the collision to the moment of her sinking, at least of water flooded into \"Titanic\", causing her displacement to nearly double from to over . The flooding did not proceed at a constant pace, nor was it distributed evenly throughout the ship, due to the configuration of the flooded compartments. Her initial list to starboard was caused by asymmetrical flooding of the starboard side as water poured down a passageway at the bottom of the ship. When the passageway was fully flooded, the list corrected itself but the ship later began to list to port by up to ten degrees as that side also flooded asymmetrically.\n\n\"Titanic\"s down angle altered fairly rapidly from zero degrees to about four and a half degrees during the first hour after the collision, but the rate at which the ship went down slowed greatly for the second hour, worsening only to about five degrees. This gave many of those aboard a false sense of hope that the ship might stay afloat long enough for them to be rescued. By 1:30, the sinking rate of the front section increased until \"Titanic\" reached a down angle of about ten degrees. At about 02:15, \"Titanic\"s angle in the water began to increase rapidly as water poured into previously unflooded parts of the ship through deck hatches, disappearing from view at 02:20.\n\nAt 00:05 on 15 April, Captain Smith ordered the ship's lifeboats uncovered and the passengers mustered. He also ordered the radio operators to begin sending distress calls, which wrongly placed the ship on the west side of the ice belt and directed rescuers to a position that turned out to be inaccurate by about . Below decks, water was pouring into the lowest levels of the ship. As the mail room flooded, the mail sorters made an ultimately futile attempt to save the 400,000 items of mail being carried aboard \"Titanic\". Elsewhere, air could be heard being forced out by inrushing water. Above them, stewards went door to door, rousing sleeping passengers and crew – \"Titanic\" did not have a public address system – and told them to go to the Boat Deck.\n\nThe thoroughness of the muster was heavily dependent on the class of the passengers; the first-class stewards were in charge of only a few cabins, while those responsible for the second- and third-class passengers had to manage large numbers of people. The first-class stewards provided hands-on assistance, helping their charges to get dressed and bringing them out onto the deck. With far more people to deal with, the second- and third-class stewards mostly confined their efforts to throwing open doors and telling passengers to put on lifebelts and come up top. In third class, passengers were largely left to their own devices after being informed of the need to come on deck. Many passengers and crew were reluctant to comply, either refusing to believe that there was a problem or preferring the warmth of the ship's interior to the bitterly cold night air. The passengers were not told that the ship was sinking, though a few noticed that she was listing.\n\nAround 00:15, the stewards began ordering the passengers to put on their lifebelts, though again, many passengers took the order as a joke. Some set about playing an impromptu game of association football with the ice chunks that were now strewn across the foredeck.\n\nOn the boat deck, as the crew began preparing the lifeboats, it was difficult to hear anything over the noise of high-pressure steam being vented from the boilers and escaping via the valves on the funnels above. Lawrence Beesley described the sound as \"a harsh, deafening boom that made conversation difficult; if one imagines 20 locomotives blowing off steam in a low key it would give some idea of the unpleasant sound that met us as we climbed out on the top deck.\" The noise was so loud that the crew had to use hand signals to communicate.\n\n\"Titanic\" had a total of 20 lifeboats, comprising 16 wooden boats on davits, 8 on either side of the ship, and 4 collapsible boats with wooden bottoms and canvas sides. The collapsibles were stored upside down with the sides folded in, and would have to be erected and moved to the davits for launching. Two were stored under the wooden boats and the other two were lashed atop the officers' quarters. The position of the latter would make them extremely difficult to launch, as they weighed several tons each and had to be manhandled down to the boat deck. On average, the lifeboats could take up to 68 people each, and collectively they could accommodate 1,178 – barely half the number of people on board and a third of the number the ship was licensed to carry. The shortage of lifeboats was not because of a lack of space nor because of cost. \"Titanic\" had been designed to accommodate up to 68 lifeboats – enough for everyone on board – and the price of an extra 32 lifeboats would only have been some , a tiny fraction of the $7.5 million that the company had spent on \"Titanic\". In an emergency, lifeboats at the time were intended to be used to transfer passengers off the distressed ship and onto a nearby vessel. It was therefore commonplace for liners to have far fewer lifeboats than needed to accommodate all their passengers and crew, and of the 39 British liners of the time of over , 33 had too few lifeboat places to accommodate everyone on board. The White Star Line desired the ship to have a wide promenade deck with uninterrupted views of the sea, which would have been obstructed by a continuous row of lifeboats.\n\nCaptain Smith was an experienced seaman who had served for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command. This was the first crisis of his career, and he would have known that even if all the boats were fully occupied, more than a thousand people would remain on the ship as she went down with little or no chance of survival. As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.\n\nThe crew was likewise unprepared for the emergency, as lifeboat training had been minimal. Only one lifeboat drill had been conducted while the ship was docked at Southampton. It was a cursory effort, consisting of two boats being lowered, each manned by one officer and four men who merely rowed around the dock for a few minutes before returning to the ship. The boats were supposed to be stocked with emergency supplies, but \"Titanic\"s passengers later found that they had only been partially provisioned despite the efforts of the ship's chief baker, Charles Joughin, and his staff to do so. No lifeboat or fire drills had been conducted since \"Titanic\" left Southampton. A lifeboat drill had been scheduled for the Sunday morning before the ship sank, but was cancelled for unknown reasons by Captain Smith.\n\nLists had been posted on the ship assigning crew members to specific lifeboat stations, but few appeared to have read them or to have known what they were supposed to do. Most of the crew were not seamen, and even some of those had no prior experience of rowing a boat. They were now faced with the complex task of coordinating the lowering of 20 boats carrying a possible total of 1,100 people down the sides of the ship. Thomas E. Bonsall, a historian of the disaster, has commented that the evacuation was so badly organised that \"even if they had the number [of] lifeboats they needed, it is impossible to see how they could have launched them\" given the lack of time and poor leadership.\n\nBy about 00:20, 40 minutes after the collision, the loading of the lifeboats was under way. Second Officer Lightoller recalled afterwards that he noticed Smith standing near the bridge looking out at the ocean in a trance-like daze. According to Lightoller, \"I yelled at the top of my voice, 'Hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir?' He heard me and nodded reply.\" Smith then ordered Lightoller and Murdoch to \"put the women and children in and lower away\". Lightoller took charge of the boats on the port side and Murdoch took charge of those on the starboard side. The two officers interpreted the \"women and children\" evacuation order differently; Murdoch took it to mean women and children first, while Lightoller took it to mean women and children only. Lightoller lowered lifeboats with empty seats if there were no women and children waiting to board, while Murdoch allowed a limited number of men to board if all the nearby women and children had embarked. Neither officer knew how many people could safely be carried in the boats as they were lowered and they both erred on the side of caution by not filling them. They could have been lowered quite safely with their full complement of 68 people, especially with the highly favourable weather and sea conditions. Had this been done, an extra 500 people could have been saved; instead, hundreds of people, predominantly men, were left on board as lifeboats were launched with many seats vacant.\n\nFew passengers at first were willing to board the lifeboats and the officers in charge of the evacuation found it difficult to persuade them. The millionaire John Jacob Astor declared: \"We are safer here than in that little boat.\" Some passengers refused flatly to embark. J. Bruce Ismay, realising the urgency of the situation, roamed the starboard boat deck urging passengers and crew to board the boats. A trickle of women, couples and single men were persuaded to board starboard lifeboat No. 7, which became the first lifeboat to be lowered.\n\nAt 00:45, lifeboat No. 7 was rowed away from \"Titanic\" with 28 passengers on board (despite a capacity of 65). Lifeboat No. 6, on the port side, was the next to be lowered at 00:55. It also had 28 people on board, among them the \"unsinkable\" Margaret \"Molly\" Brown. Lightoller realised there was only one seaman on board (Quartermaster Robert Hichens) and called for volunteers. Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club stepped forward and climbed down a rope into the lifeboat; he was the only adult male passenger whom Lightoller allowed to board during the port side evacuation. Peuchen's role highlighted a key problem during the evacuation: there were hardly any seamen to man the boats. Some had been sent below to open gangway doors to allow more passengers to be evacuated, but they never returned. They were presumably trapped and drowned by the rising water below decks.\n\nMeanwhile, other crewmen fought to maintain vital services as water continued to pour into the ship below decks. The engineers and firemen worked to vent steam from the boilers to prevent them from exploding on contact with the cold water. They re-opened watertight doors in order to set up extra portable pumps in the forward compartments in a futile bid to reduce the torrent, and kept the electrical generators running to maintain lights and power throughout the ship. Steward F. Dent Ray narrowly avoided being swept away when a wooden wall between his quarters and the third-class accommodation on E deck collapsed, leaving him waist-deep in water. Two engineers, Herbert Harvey and Jonathan Shepherd (who had just broken his left leg after falling into a manhole minutes earlier), died in boiler room No. 5 when, at around 00:45, the bunker door separating it from the flooded No. 6 boiler room collapsed and they were swept away by \"a wave of green foam\" according to leading fireman Frederick Barrett, who barely escaped from the boiler room.\n\nIn boiler room No. 4, at around 01:20, water began flooding in from below, possibly indicating that the bottom of the ship had also been holed by the iceberg. The flow of water soon overwhelmed the pumps and forced the firemen and trimmers to evacuate the forward boiler rooms. Further aft, Chief Engineer William Bell, his engineering colleagues, and a handful of volunteer firemen and greasers stayed behind in the unflooded No. 1, 2 and 3 boiler rooms and in the turbine and reciprocating engine rooms. They continued working on the boilers and the electrical generators in order to keep the ship's lights and pumps operable and to power the radio so that distress signals could be sent. They remained at their posts until the very end, thus ensuring that \"Titanic\"s electrics functioned until the final minutes of the sinking. None of the ship's 35 engineers and electricians survived. Neither did any of the \"Titanic\"s five postal clerks, who were last seen struggling to save the mail bags they had rescued from the flooded mail room. They were caught by the rising water somewhere on D deck.\n\nMany of the third-class passengers were also confronted with the sight of water pouring into their quarters on E, F and G decks. Carl Jansson, one of the relatively small number of third-class survivors, later recalled:\nThen I run down to my cabin to bring my other clothes, watch and bag but only had time to take the watch and coat when water with enormous force came into the cabin and I had to rush up to the deck again where I found my friends standing with lifebelts on and with terror painted on their faces. What should I do now, with no lifebelt and no shoes and no cap?\nThe lifeboats were lowered every few minutes on each side, but most of the boats were greatly under-filled. No. 5 left with 41 aboard, No. 3 had 32 aboard, No. 8 left with 39 and No. 1 left with just 12 out of a capacity of 40. The evacuation did not go smoothly and passengers suffered accidents and injuries as it progressed. One woman fell between lifeboat No. 10 and the side of the ship but someone caught her by the ankle and hauled her back onto the promenade deck, where she made a second successful attempt at boarding. First-class passenger Annie Stengel broke several ribs when an overweight German-American doctor and his brother jumped into No. 5, squashing her and knocking her unconscious. The lifeboats' descent was likewise risky. No. 6 was nearly flooded during the descent by water discharging out of the ship's side, but successfully made it away from the ship. No. 3 came close to disaster when, for a time, one of the davits jammed, threatening to pitch the passengers out of the lifeboat and into the sea.\nBy 01:20, the seriousness of the situation was now apparent to the passengers above decks, who began saying their goodbyes, with husbands escorting their wives and children to the lifeboats. Distress flares were fired every few minutes to attract the attention of any ships nearby and the radio operators repeatedly sent the distress signal CQD. Radio operator Harold Bride suggested to his colleague Jack Phillips that he should use the new SOS signal, as it \"may be your last chance to send it\". The two radio operators contacted other ships to ask for assistance. Several responded, of which RMS \"Carpathia\" was the closest, at away. She was a much slower vessel than \"Titanic\" and, even driven at her maximum speed of , would have taken four hours to reach the sinking ship. Another to respond was SS \"Mount Temple\", which set a course and headed for \"Titanic\"'s position but was stopped en-route by pack ice.\n\nMuch nearer was , which had warned \"Titanic\" of ice a few hours earlier. Apprehensive at his ship being caught in a large field of drift ice, \"Californian\"s captain, Stanley Lord, had decided at about 22:00 to halt for the night and wait for daylight to find a way through the ice field. At 23:30, 10 minutes before \"Titanic\" hit the iceberg, \"Californian\"s sole radio operator, Cyril Evans, shut his set down for the night and went to bed. On the bridge her Third Officer, Charles Groves, saw a large vessel to starboard around away. It made a sudden turn to port and stopped. If the radio operator of \"Californian\" had stayed at his post fifteen minutes longer, hundreds of lives might have been saved. A little over an hour later, Second Officer Herbert Stone saw five white rockets exploding above the stopped ship. Unsure what the rockets meant, he called Captain Lord, who was resting in the chartroom, and reported the sighting. Lord did not act on the report, but Stone was perturbed: \"A ship is not going to fire rockets at sea for nothing,\" he told a colleague.\n\nBy this time, it was clear to those on \"Titanic\" that the ship was indeed sinking and there would not be enough lifeboat places for everyone. Some still clung to the hope that the worst would not happen: Lucien Smith told his wife Eloise, \"It is only a matter of form to have women and children first. The ship is thoroughly equipped and everyone on her will be saved.\" Charlotte Collyer's husband Harvey called to his wife as she was put in a lifeboat, \"Go, Lottie! For God's sake, be brave and go! I'll get a seat in another boat!\"\n\nOther couples refused to be separated. Ida Straus, the wife of Macy's department store co-owner and former member of the United States House of Representatives Isidor Straus, told her husband: \"We have been living together for many years. Where you go, I go.\" They sat down in a pair of deck chairs and waited for the end. The industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim changed out of his life vest and sweater into top hat and evening dress and declared his wish to go down with the ship like a gentleman.\n\nAt this point, the vast majority of passengers who had boarded lifeboats were from first- and second-class. Few third-class (steerage) passengers had made it up onto the deck, and most were still lost in the maze of corridors or trapped behind barriers and partitions that segregated the accommodation for the steerage passengers from the first- and second-class areas. This segregation was not simply for social reasons, but was a requirement of United States immigration laws, which mandated that third-class passengers be segregated to control immigration and to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. First- and second-class passengers on transatlantic liners disembarked at the main piers on Manhattan Island, but steerage passengers had to go through health checks and processing at Ellis Island. In at least some places, \"Titanic\"s crew appear to have actively hindered the steerage passengers' escape. Some of the barriers were locked and guarded by crew members, apparently to prevent the steerage passengers from rushing the lifeboats. Irish survivor Margaret Murphy wrote in May 1912:\nBefore all the steerage passengers had even a chance of their lives, the \"Titanic\"s sailors fastened the doors and companionways leading up from the third-class section ... A crowd of men was trying to get up to a higher deck and were fighting the sailors; all striking and scuffling and swearing. Women and some children were there praying and crying. Then the sailors fastened down the hatchways leading to the third-class section. They said they wanted to keep the air down there so the vessel could stay up longer. It meant all hope was gone for those still down there.\nA long and winding route had to be taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the farthest away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.\n\nSome, perhaps overwhelmed by it all, made no attempt to escape and stayed in their cabins or congregated in prayer in the third-class dining room. Leading Fireman Charles Hendrickson saw crowds of third-class passengers below decks with their trunks and possessions, as if waiting for someone to direct them. Psychologist Wynn Craig Wade attributes this to \"stoic passivity\" produced by generations of being told what to do by social superiors. August Wennerström, one of the male steerage passengers to survive, commented later that many of his companions had made no effort to save themselves. He wrote:\nHundreds were in a circle [in the third-class dining saloon] with a preacher in the middle, praying, crying, asking God and Mary to help them. They lay there and yelled, never lifting a hand to help themselves. They had lost their own will power and expected God to do all the work for them.\n\nBy 01:30, \"Titanic\"s downward angle in the water was increasing and the ship was now listing slightly more to port, but not more than 5 degrees. The deteriorating situation was reflected in the tone of the messages sent from the ship: \"We are putting the women off in the boats\" at 01:25, \"Engine room getting flooded\" at 01:35, and at 01:45, \"Engine room full up to boilers.\" This was \"Titanic\"s last intelligible signal, sent as the ship's electrical system began to fail; subsequent messages were jumbled and broken. The two radio operators nonetheless continued sending out distress messages almost to the very end.\n\nThe remaining boats were filled much closer to capacity and in an increasing rush. No. 11 was filled with five people more than its rated capacity. As it was lowered, it was nearly flooded by water being pumped out of the ship. No. 13 narrowly avoided the same problem but those aboard were unable to release the ropes from which the boat had been lowered. It drifted astern, directly under No. 15 as it was being lowered. The ropes were cut in time and both boats made it away safely.\n\nThe first signs of panic were seen when a group of passengers attempted to rush port-side lifeboat No. 14 as it was being lowered with 40 people aboard. Fifth Officer Lowe, who was in charge of the boat, fired three warning shots in the air to control the crowd without causing injuries. No. 16 was lowered five minutes later. Among those aboard was stewardess Violet Jessop, who would repeat the experience four years later when she survived the sinking of one of \"Titanic\"s sister ships, , in the First World War. Collapsible boat C was launched at 01:40 from a now largely deserted area of the deck, as most of those on deck had moved to the stern of the ship. It was aboard this boat that White Star chairman and managing director J. Bruce Ismay, \"Titanic\"s most controversial survivor, made his escape from the ship, an act later condemned as cowardice.\n\nAt 01:45, lifeboat No. 2 was lowered. While it was still at deck level, Lightoller had found the boat occupied by men who, he wrote later, \"weren't British, nor of the English-speaking race ... [but of] the broad category known to sailors as 'dagoes'.\" After he evicted them by threatening them with his revolver, he was unable to find enough women and children to fill the boat and lowered it with only 25 people on board out of a possible capacity of 40. John Jacob Astor saw his wife off to safety in No. 4 boat at 01:55 but was refused entry by Lightoller, even though 20 of the 60 seats aboard were unoccupied.\n\nThe last boat to be launched was collapsible D, which left at 02:05 with 25 people aboard; two more men jumped on the boat as it was being lowered. The sea had reached the boat deck and the forecastle was deep underwater. First-class passenger Edith Evans gave up her place in the boat, and ultimately died in the disaster. She was one of only four women in first class to perish in the sinking. Captain Smith carried out a final tour of the deck, telling the radio operators and other crew members: \"Now it's every man for himself.\"\n\nAs passengers and crew headed to the stern, where Father Thomas Byles was hearing confessions and giving absolutions, \"Titanic\"s band played outside the gymnasium. \"Titanic\" had two separate bands of musicians. One was a quintet led by Wallace Hartley that played after dinner and at religious services while the other was a trio who played in the reception area and outside the café and restaurant. The two bands had separate music libraries and arrangements and had not played together before the sinking. Around 30 minutes after colliding with the iceberg, the two bands were called by Captain Smith who ordered them to play in the first class lounge. Passengers present remember them playing lively tunes such as \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\". It is unknown if the two piano players were with the band at this time. The exact time is unknown, but the musicians later moved to the boat deck level where they played before moving outside onto the deck itself.\n\nPart of the enduring folklore of the \"Titanic\" sinking is that the musicians played the hymn \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" as the ship sank, but this appears to be dubious. The claim surfaced among the earliest reports of the sinking, and the hymn became so closely associated with the \"Titanic\" disaster that its opening bars were carved on the grave monument of \"Titanic\"s bandmaster, Wallace Hartley, one of those who perished. Violet Jessop said in her 1934 account of the disaster that she had heard the hymn being played. In contrast, Archibald Gracie emphatically denied it in his own account, written soon after the sinking, and Radio Operator Harold Bride said that he had heard the band playing ragtime, then \"Autumn\", by which he may have meant Archibald Joyce's then-popular waltz \"Songe d'Automne\" (Autumn Dream). George Orrell, the bandmaster of the rescue ship, \"Carpathia\", who spoke with survivors, related: \"The ship's band in any emergency is expected to play to calm the passengers. After \"Titanic\" struck the iceberg the band began to play bright music, dance music, comic songs – anything that would prevent the passengers from becoming panic-stricken ... various awe-stricken passengers began to think of the death that faced them and asked the bandmaster to play hymns. The one which appealed to all was 'Nearer My God to Thee'.\" According to Gracie, who was near the band until that section of deck went under, the tunes played by the band were \"cheerful\" but he didn't recognise any of them, claiming that if they had played 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' as claimed in the newspaper \"I assuredly should have noticed it and regarded it as a tactless warning of immediate death to us all and one likely to create panic.\" Several survivors who were among the last to leave the ship claimed that the band continued playing until the slope of the deck became too steep for them to stand, Gracie claimed that the band stopped playing at least 30 minutes before the vessel sank. Several witnesses support this account including A. H. Barkworth, a first-class passenger who testified: \"I do not wish to detract from the bravery of anybody, but I might mention that when I first came on deck the band was playing a waltz. The next time I passed where the band was stationed, the members had thrown down their instruments and were not to be seen.\"\n\nBride heard the band playing as he left the radio cabin, which was by now awash, in the company of the other radio operator, Jack Phillips. He had just had a fight with a man who Bride thought was \"a stoker, or someone from below decks\", who had attempted to steal Phillips' lifebelt. Bride wrote later: \"I did my duty. I hope I finished [the man]. I don't know. We left him on the cabin floor of the radio room, and he was not moving.\" The two radio operators went in opposite directions, Phillips aft and Bride forward towards collapsible lifeboat B.\n\nArchibald Gracie was also heading aft, but as he made his way towards the stern he found his path blocked by \"a mass of humanity several lines deep, covering the boat deck, facing us\" – hundreds of steerage passengers, who had finally made it to the deck just as the last lifeboats departed. He gave up on the idea of going aft and jumped into the water to get away from the crowd. Others made no attempt to escape. The ship's designer, Thomas Andrews, was reportedly last seen in the first-class smoking room, having removed his lifebelt, staring at the painting above the fireplace. Captain Smith's fate is unclear as there are conflicting accounts of his death; he either entered the wheelhouse on the bridge and died there when it was engulfed or jumped into the water just before the bridge was submerged and subsequently perished in the water, possibly near Collapsible B.\n\nAt about 02:15, \"Titanic\"s angle in the water began to increase rapidly as water poured into previously unflooded parts of the ship through deck hatches. Her suddenly increasing angle caused what one survivor called a \"giant wave\" to wash along the ship from the forward end of the boat deck, sweeping many people into the sea. The parties who were trying to lower collapsible boats A and B, including Chief Officer Henry Wilde, First Officer Murdoch, Second Officer Charles Lightoller and Colonel Archibald Gracie, were swept away along with the two boats (boat B floated away upside-down with Harold Bride trapped underneath it, and boat A ended up partly flooded and with its canvas not raised). Bride, Gracie and Lightoller made it onto boat B, but Murdoch and Wilde perished in the water.\n\nLightoller opted to abandon his post to escape the growing crowds, and dived into the water from the roof of the officers' quarters. He was sucked into the mouth of a ventilation shaft but was blown clear by \"a terrific blast of hot air\" and emerged next to the capsized lifeboat. The forward funnel collapsed under its own weight, crushing several people as it fell into the water and only narrowly missing the lifeboat. It closely missed Lightoller and created a wave that washed the boat 50 yards clear of the sinking ship. Those still on \"Titanic\" felt her structure shuddering as it underwent immense stresses. As first-class passenger Jack Thayer described it:\nOccasionally there had been a muffled thud or deadened explosion within the ship. Now, without warning she seemed to start forward, moving forward and into the water at an angle of about fifteen degrees. This movement with the water rushing up toward us was accompanied by a rumbling roar, mixed with more muffled explosions. It was like standing under a steel railway bridge while an express train passes overhead mingled with the noise of a pressed steel factory and wholesale breakage of china.\nEyewitnesses saw \"Titanic\"s stern rising high into the air as the ship tilted down in the water. It was said to have reached an angle of 30–45 degrees, \"revolving apparently around a centre of gravity just astern of midships\", as Lawrence Beesley later put it. Many survivors described a great noise, which some attributed to the boilers exploding. Beesley described it as \"partly a groan, partly a rattle, and partly a smash, and it was not a sudden roar as an explosion would be: it went on successively for some seconds, possibly fifteen to twenty\". He attributed it to \"the engines and machinery coming loose from their bolts and bearings, and falling through the compartments, smashing everything in their way\".\n\nAfter another minute, the ship's lights flickered once and then permanently went out, plunging \"Titanic\" into darkness. Jack Thayer recalled seeing \"groups of the fifteen hundred people still aboard, clinging in clusters or bunches, like swarming bees; only to fall in masses, pairs or singly as the great afterpart of the ship, two hundred fifty feet of it, rose into the sky.\"\n\n\"Titanic\" was subjected to extreme opposing forces – the flooded bow pulling her down while the air in the stern kept her to the surface – which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. Shortly after the lights went out, the ship split apart. The submerged bow may have remained attached to the stern by the keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt and then settle briefly until sinking. The ship disappeared from view at 02:20, 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg. Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, \"gradually [turning] her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle ... Then, with the deadened noise of the bursting of her last few gallant bulkheads, she slid quietly away from us into the sea.\"\n\n\"Titanic\"s surviving officers and some prominent survivors testified that the ship had sunk in one piece, a belief that was affirmed by the British and American inquiries into the disaster. Archibald Gracie, who was on the promenade deck with the band (by the second funnel), stated that \"\"Titanic\"s decks were intact at the time she sank, and when I sank with her, there was over seven-sixteenths of the ship already under water, and there was no indication then of any impending break of the deck or ship\". Ballard argued that many other survivors' accounts indicated that the ship had broken in two as it was sinking. As the engines are now known to have stayed in place along with most of the boilers, the \"great noise\" heard by witnesses and the momentary settling of the stern were presumably caused by the break-up of the ship rather than the loosening of her fittings or boiler explosions.\n\nAfter they went under, the bow and stern took only about 5–6 minutes to sink , spilling a trail of heavy machinery, tons of coal and large quantities of debris from \"Titanic\"s interior. The two parts of the ship landed about apart on a gently undulating area of the seabed. The streamlined bow section continued to descend at about the angle it had taken on the surface, striking the seabed prow-first at a shallow angle at an estimated speed of . Its momentum caused it to dig a deep gouge into the seabed and buried the section up to deep in sediment before it came to an abrupt halt. The sudden deceleration caused the bow's structure to buckle downwards by several degrees just forward of the bridge. The decks at the rear end of the bow section, which had already been weakened during the break-up, collapsed one atop another.\n\nThe stern section seems to have descended almost vertically, probably rotating as it fell. Empty tanks and cofferdams imploded as it descended, tearing open the structure and folding back the steel ribbing of the poop deck. The section landed with such force that it buried itself about deep at the rudder. The decks pancaked down on top of each other and the hull plating splayed out to the sides. Debris continued to rain down across the seabed for several hours after the sinking.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the sinking, hundreds of passengers and crew were left dying in the icy sea, surrounded by debris from the ship. \"Titanic\"s disintegration during her descent to the seabed caused buoyant chunks of debris – timber beams, wooden doors, furniture, panelling and chunks of cork from the bulkheads – to rocket to the surface. These injured and possibly killed some of the swimmers; others used the debris to try to keep themselves afloat.\n\nWith a temperature of , the water was lethally cold. Second Officer Lightoller described the feeling of \"a thousand knives\" being driven into his body as he entered the sea. Sudden immersion into freezing water typically causes death within minutes, either from cardiac arrest, uncontrollable breathing of water, or cold incapacitation (not, as commonly believed, from hypothermia); almost all of those in the water died of cardiac arrest or other bodily reactions to freezing water within 15–30 minutes. Only 13 of them were helped into the lifeboats even though these had room for almost 500 more people.\n\nThose in the lifeboats were horrified to hear the sound of what Lawrence Beesley called \"every possible emotion of human fear, despair, agony, fierce resentment and blind anger mingled – I am certain of those – with notes of infinite surprise, as though each one were saying, 'How is it possible that this awful thing is happening to \"me\"? That I should be caught in this death trap? Jack Thayer compared it to the sound of \"locusts on a summer night\", while George Rheims, who jumped moments before \"Titanic\" sank, described it as \"a dismal moaning sound which I won't ever forget; it came from those poor people who were floating around, calling for help. It was horrifying, mysterious, supernatural.\"\n\nThe noise of the people in the water screaming, yelling, and crying was a tremendous shock to the occupants of the lifeboats, many of whom had up to that moment believed that everyone had escaped before the ship sank. As Beesley later wrote, the cries \"came as a thunderbolt, unexpected, inconceivable, incredible. No one in any of the boats standing off a few hundred yards away can have escaped the paralysing shock of knowing that so short a distance away a tragedy, unbelievable in its magnitude, was being enacted, which we, helpless, could in no way avert or diminish.\"\nOnly a few of those in the water survived. Among them were Archibald Gracie, Jack Thayer and Charles Lightoller, who made it to the capsized collapsible boat B. Around 12 crew members climbed on board Collapsible B, and they rescued those they could until some 35 men were clinging precariously to the upturned hull. Realising the risk to the boat of being swamped by the mass of swimmers around them, they paddled slowly away, ignoring the pleas of dozens of swimmers to be allowed on board. In his account, Gracie wrote of the admiration he had for those in the water; \"In no instance, I am happy to say, did I hear any word of rebuke from a swimmer because of a refusal to grant assistance... [one refusal] was met with the manly voice of a powerful man... 'All right boys, good luck and God bless you'.\" Several other swimmers (probably 20 or more) reached Collapsible boat A, which was upright but partly flooded, as its sides had not been properly raised. Its occupants had to sit for hours in a foot of freezing water, and many died of hypothermia during the night.\n\nFarther out, the other eighteen lifeboats – most of which had empty seats – drifted as the occupants debated what, if anything, they should do to rescue the swimmers. Boat No. 4, having remained near the sinking ship, seems to have been closest to the site of the sinking at around away; this had enabled two people to drop into the boat and another to be picked up from the water before the ship sank. After the sinking, seven more men were pulled from the water, although two later died. Collapsible D rescued one male passenger who jumped in the water and swam over to the boat immediately after it had been lowered. In all the other boats, the occupants eventually decided against returning, probably out of fear that they would be capsized in the attempt. Some put their objections bluntly; Quartermaster Hichens, commanding lifeboat No. 6, told the women aboard his boat that there was no point returning as there were \"only a lot of stiffs there\".\n\nAfter about twenty minutes, the cries began to fade as the swimmers lapsed into unconsciousness and death. Fifth Officer Lowe, in charge of lifeboat No. 14, \"waited until the yells and shrieks had subsided for the people to thin out\" before mounting an attempt to rescue those in the water. He gathered together five of the lifeboats and transferred the occupants between them to free up space in No. 14. Lowe then took a crew of seven crewmen and one male passenger who volunteered to help, and then rowed back to the site of the sinking. The whole operation took about three-quarters of an hour. By the time No. 14 headed back to the site of the sinking, almost all of those in the water were dead and only a few voices could still be heard.\n\nLucy, Lady Duff-Gordon, recalled after the disaster that \"the very last cry was that of a man who had been calling loudly: 'My God! My God!' He cried monotonously, in a dull, hopeless way. For an entire hour there had been an awful chorus of shrieks, gradually dying into a hopeless moan, until this last cry that I speak of. Then all was silent.\" Lowe and his crew found four men still alive, one of whom died shortly afterwards. Otherwise, all they could see were \"hundreds of bodies and lifebelts\"; the dead \"seemed as if they had perished with the cold as their limbs were all cramped up\".\n\nIn the other boats, there was nothing the survivors could do but await the arrival of rescue ships. The air was bitterly cold and several of the boats had taken on water. The survivors could not find any food or drinkable water in the boats, and most had no lights. The situation was particularly bad aboard collapsible B, which was only kept afloat by a diminishing air pocket in the upturned hull. As dawn approached, the wind rose and the sea became increasingly choppy, forcing those on the collapsible boat to stand up to balance it. Some, exhausted by the ordeal, fell off into the sea and were drowned. It became steadily harder for the rest to keep their balance on the hull, with waves washing across it. Archibald Gracie later wrote of how he and the other survivors sitting on the upturned hull were struck by \"the utter helplessness of our position\".\n\n\"Titanic\"s survivors were rescued around 04:00 on 15 April by the RMS \"Carpathia\", which had steamed through the night at high speed and at considerable risk, as the ship had to dodge numerous icebergs \"en route\". \"Carpathia\"s lights were first spotted around 03:30, which greatly cheered the survivors, though it took several more hours for everyone to be brought aboard. The 30 or more men on collapsible B finally managed to board two other lifeboats, but one survivor died just before the transfer was made. Collapsible A was also in trouble and was now nearly awash; many of those aboard (maybe more than a half) had died overnight. The remaining survivors – an unknown number of men, estimated to be between 10–11 and more than 20, and one woman – were transferred from A into another lifeboat, leaving behind three bodies in the boat, which was left to drift away. It was recovered a month later by the White Star liner with the bodies still aboard.\n\nThose on \"Carpathia\" were startled by the scene that greeted them as the sun came up: \"fields of ice on which, like points on the landscape, rested innumerable pyramids of ice.\" Captain Arthur Rostron of \"Carpathia\" saw ice all around, including 20 large bergs measuring up to high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from \"Titanic\". It appeared to \"Carpathia\"s passengers that their ship was in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs appearing like hills in the distance.\n\nAs the lifeboats were brought alongside \"Carpathia\", the survivors came aboard the ship by various means. Some were strong enough to climb up rope ladders; others were hoisted up in slings, and the children were hoisted in mail sacks. The last lifeboat to reach the ship was Lightoller's boat No. 12, with 74 people aboard a boat designed to carry 65. They were all on \"Carpathia\" by 09:00. There were some scenes of joy as families and friends were reunited, but in most cases hopes died as loved ones failed to reappear.\n\nAt 09:15, two more ships appeared on the scene – \"Mount Temple\" and \"Californian\", which had finally learned of the disaster when her radio operator returned to duty – but by then there were no more survivors to rescue. \"Carpathia\" had been bound for Fiume, Austria-Hungary (now Rijeka, Croatia), but as she had neither the stores nor the medical facilities to cater for the survivors, Rostron ordered that a course be calculated to return the ship to New York, where the survivors could be properly looked after. \"Carpathia\" departed the area, leaving the other ships to carry out a final, fruitless, two-hour search.\n\nWhen \"Carpathia\" arrived at Pier 54 in New York on the evening of 18 April after a difficult voyage through pack ice, fog, thunderstorms and rough seas, some 40,000 people were standing on the wharves, alerted to the disaster by a stream of radio messages from \"Carpathia\" and other ships. It was only after \"Carpathia\" docked – three days after \"Titanic\"s sinking – that the full scope of the disaster became public knowledge.\n\nEven before \"Carpathia\" arrived in New York, efforts were getting underway to retrieve the dead. Four ships chartered by the White Star Line succeeded in retrieving 328 bodies; 119 were buried at sea, while the remaining 209 were brought ashore to the Canadian port of Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 150 of them were buried. Memorials were raised in various places – New York, Washington, Southampton, Liverpool, Belfast and Lichfield, among others – and ceremonies were held on both sides of the Atlantic to commemorate the dead and raise funds to aid the survivors. The bodies of most of \"Titanic\"s victims were never recovered, and the only evidence of their deaths was found 73 years later among the debris on the seabed: pairs of shoes lying side by side, where bodies had once lain before eventually decomposing.\n\nThe prevailing public reaction to the disaster was one of shock and outrage, directed against several issues and people: why were there so few lifeboats? Why had Ismay saved his own life when so many others died? Why did \"Titanic\" proceed into the ice field at full speed? The outrage was driven not least by the survivors themselves; even while they were aboard \"Carpathia\" on their way to New York, Beesley and other survivors determined to \"awaken public opinion to safeguard ocean travel in the future\" and wrote a public letter to \"The Times\" urging changes to maritime safety laws.\n\nIn places closely associated with \"Titanic\", the sense of grief was deep. The heaviest losses were in Southampton, home port to 699 crew members and also home to many of the passengers. Crowds of weeping women – the wives, sisters and mothers of crew – gathered outside the White Star offices in Southampton for news of their loved ones. Most of them were among the 549 Southampton residents who perished. In Belfast, churches were packed, and shipyard workers wept in the streets. The ship had been a symbol of Belfast's industrial achievements, and there was not only a sense of grief but also one of guilt, as those who had built \"Titanic\" came to feel they had been responsible in some way for her loss.\n\nIn the aftermath of the sinking, public inquiries were set up in Britain and the United States. The US inquiry began on 19 April under the chairmanship of Senator William Alden Smith, and the British inquiry commenced in London under Lord Mersey on 2 May 1912. They reached broadly similar conclusions: the regulations on the number of lifeboats that ships had to carry were out of date and inadequate; Captain Smith had failed to take proper heed of ice warnings; the lifeboats had not been properly filled or crewed; and the collision was the direct result of steaming into a danger area at too high a speed. Both inquiries strongly criticised Captain Lord of \"Californian\" for failing to render assistance to \"Titanic\".\n\nNeither inquiry found negligence by the International Mercantile Marine Co. (the parent company) or the White Star Line (which owned \"Titanic\") to be a factor. The US inquiry concluded that those involved had followed standard practice, and the disaster could thus only be categorised as an \"act of God\", and the British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice which had not previously been shown to be unsafe (the inquiry noted that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 73 lives) and concluded that he had done \"only that which other skilled men would have done in the same position\". The British inquiry also warned that \"What was a mistake in the case of the \"Titanic\" would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future.\"\n\nThe disaster led to major changes in maritime regulations to implement new safety measures, such as ensuring that more lifeboats were provided, that lifeboat drills were properly carried out and that radio equipment on passenger ships was manned around the clock. An International Ice Patrol was set up to monitor the presence of icebergs in the North Atlantic, and maritime safety regulations were harmonised internationally through the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS); both measures are still in force today.\n\n\"Titanic\"s sinking has become a cultural phenomenon, commemorated by artists, film-makers, writers, composers, musicians and dancers from the time immediately after the sinking to the present day. On 1 September 1985, a joint US-French expedition led by Robert Ballard found the wreck of \"Titanic\", and the ship's rediscovery led to an explosion of interest in \"Titanic\"s story. Numerous expeditions have been launched to film the wreck and, controversially, to salvage objects from the debris field. The first major exhibition of recovered artefacts was held at London's National Maritime Museum in 1994–95. In 1997, James Cameron's eponymous film became the first movie ever to take $1 billion at the box office, and the became the best selling soundtrack recording of all time.\n\nThe wreck is steadily decaying, turning to oxide at a rate of 0.5–1 ton per day (assuming one ten-thousandth of an inch per day on all surfaces). Eventually \"Titanic\"s structure will collapse, and she will be reduced to a patch of rust on the seabed, with any remaining scraps of the ship's hull mingled with her more durable fittings, like the propellers, bronze capstans, compasses and the telemotor.\n\nThe number of casualties of the sinking is unclear due to several factors, including confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were double-counted on the casualty lists. The death toll has been put at between 1,490 and 1,635 people. The figures below are from the British Board of Trade report on the disaster.\n\nLess than a third of those aboard \"Titanic\" survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard \"Carpathia\". Of the groups shown in the table, 49 percent of the children, 26 percent of the female passengers, 82 percent of the male passengers and 78 percent of the crew died. The figures show stark differences in the survival rates between men and women, and of the different classes aboard \"Titanic\", especially among women and children. Although less than 10 percent of first- and second-class women (combined) were lost, 54 percent of those in third class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third class perished. The only first-class child to perish was Loraine Allison, aged two. Proportionately, the heaviest losses were suffered by the second-class men, of whom 92 percent died. Of the pets brought aboard, three survived the sinking.\n\nBooks\n\nJournal articles\n\nNews reports\n\nInvestigations\n"}

It has been performed in several venues. It premiered at the 2010 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The Off-Broadway production, which ran from September 11 – October 23, 2011 at the New York Theatre Workshop (NYTW), earned awards for its sound design.\n\nIt was performed at the Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh in 2010, the Arts Bank in Philadelphia in 2010, at ArtsEmerson in Boston in 2011, the NYTW in New York City in 2011, the 2012 Dublin Theatre Festival, and McCarter Theatre in Princeton in 2012. The work, named for a bar at which the protagonists gather, features a bullfight on stage. The show is faithful to the original ill-fated romantic triangle between Americans Robert Cohn and Jake Barnes and Brit Lady Brett Ashley that was set in Spain and France. This work is like much of the Elevator Repair Service's other performances in which \"the cast recites parts of the book verbatim while also drolly enacting dance, drama and mayhem onstage\". The show was notable for its unusual cacophony, which is controlled by the performers rather than sound technicians.\n\nThe Off-Broadway production began previews on August 19, 2011 and officially opened on September 11. It was scheduled to run until October 9 and was extended until October 23.\n\nA production at Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C., opened on February 18, 2017 and will run until April 2.\n\n\nMatt Tierney and Ben Williams won the 2012 Obie Award for Sound Design and the 2012 Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Sound Design. David Zinn was nominated for the Lortel Award in Outstanding Scenic Design.\n\nLyn Gardner of \"The Guardian\", while noting its length, praised the performance in Edinburgh describing it as \"theatrical open-heart surgery on Ernest Hemingway's first major success\" done with \"surgical expertise and a droll, playful humour\" that is too long at nearly four hours. Erik Piepenburg of \"The New York Times\" says that although words are important to this performance, so are sounds. When Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" saw the 2010 Philadelphia performance, he praised the presentation of the alcoholic consumption and continuous party atmosphere saying \"This alcoholic element is what has been conjured so persuasively\" and the show is \"a wood-paneled temple to drinks past, present and future\". However, upon seeing the 2011 Off-Broadway performance, Brantley says \"...it never entirely wraps its mind around the style and essence of the book that inspired it\". \"The Village Voice\"'s Helen Shaw describes the show as \"a gleefully drunken, offhandedly contemporary animation of Hemingway's hardboiled classic\". Adam Hetrick of \"Playbill\" described the performance as \"a dramatic explosion of Hemingway's 1926 novel, that melds text, theatrical avant garde and an evocative soundscape\".\n"}

Located on the river Lys.\n\nAt the time of the Gauls, \"Tarwanna\" or \"Tervanna\" was the capital of the Belgian tribe of the Morini. After the Romans conquered Gaul, they too made the city the capital of the \"Civitas Morinorum\" district.\n\nThe origin of the name has several theories. According to the historian Malbracq, it got its name from its founder \"Lucius Tauruannus\", others say it is derived from \"Terra avanae\" The land of Oats. But this second derivation seems to be a generic used term. \n\nIn the 7th century, probably around 639, Saint Audomar (Saint Omer) established the bishopric of \"Terwaan\" or \"Terenburg\", the diocese of Thérouanne, which during the Middle Ages controlled a large part of the left bank of the river Scheldt. Territorially it was part of the county of Artois which belonged to the county of Flanders.\n\nThanks to that ecclesiastical control of some of the most prosperous cities north of the Alps, like Arras and Ypres, the bishopric was able to build a cathedral which was at the time the largest in France.\n\nThe town was captured by the Emperor Maximilian and Henry VIII from the French in 1513 after the battle of the Spurs. In 1553 Charles V besieged Thérouanne, then a French enclave in the Holy Roman Empire, in revenge for a defeat by the French at the siege of Metz. After he captured the city he ordered it to be razed, the roads to be broken up, and the area to be ploughed and salted. Only a small commune which lay outside the city walls, then named Saint-Martin-Outre-Eaux, was left standing, and later (probably around 1800) took over the name \"Thérouanne\". Part of the portal of the cathedral was acquired by Saint-Omer; a colossal statue of Christ is all that is left of it these days.\n\nThe disappearance of the former bishopric led to a reform of sees at the Council of Trent, and the bishopric of Thérouanne was split between those of Saint-Omer and Ypres.\n\nTherouanne lies on the Via Francigena.\n\n\n\nThérouanne is twinned with Hamstreet in Kent (in southern England, across the English Channel).\n\nHugh of Saint Omer (also Hugh of Falkenberg or Hugh of Fauquembergues, died 1106) was the Prince of Galilee and Lord of Tiberias\n\n\n"}

Johns\n\nWilliam Earl Johns (5 February 189321 June 1968) was an English First World War pilot, and writer of adventure stories, usually written under the pen name Capt. W. E. Johns. He was the creator of the fictional air-adventurer \"Biggles\".\n\nJohns was born in Bengeo, Hertford, England, the son of Richard Eastman Johns, a fabric tailor, and Elizabeth Johns (née Earl), the daughter of a master butcher. A younger brother, Russell Ernest Johns, was born on 24 October 1895. Johns' early ambition was to be a soldier, and he was a crack shot with a rifle. From January 1905, he attended Hertford Grammar School. He also attended evening classes at the local art school.\n\nJohns was not a natural scholar. He included some of his experiences at this school in his book \"Biggles Goes to School\" (1951). In the summer of 1907 he was apprenticed to a county municipal surveyor for four years and in 1912 was appointed as a sanitary inspector in Swaffham in Norfolk. Soon afterwards, his father died of tuberculosis at the age of 47. On 6 October 1914 Johns married Maude Penelope Hunt (1882–1961), the daughter of the Rev. John Hunt, vicar of Little Dunham, Norfolk. Their only son, William Earl Carmichael Johns, was born in March 1916.\n\nIn 1913, while living in Swaffham, and working as a sanitary inspector, Johns enlisted in the Territorial Army as a trooper in the King's Own Royal Regiment (Norfolk Yeomanry). The regiment was mobilised in August 1914 and was sent overseas in September 1915, embarking on RMS \"Olympic\". The Norfolk Yeomanry fought (as infantry) at Gallipoli until December when they were withdrawn to Egypt. In September 1916 Johns transferred to the Machine Gun Corps. While serving on the Macedonian front in Greece he was hospitalised with malaria. After recovering, he was commissioned into the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) in September 1917 as a temporary second lieutenant and posted back to England for flight training.\n\nJohns undertook his initial flying training at the short-lived airfield at Coley Park in Reading, flying the Farman MF.11 Shorthorn aircraft. He was then posted to No.25 Flying Training School at Thetford in Norfolk, closer to where his wife Maude and son Jack were living.\nOn 1 April 1918, Johns was appointed flying instructor at Marske-by-the-Sea in Cleveland. The aircraft of the time were very unreliable and he wrote off three planes in three days through engine failure – crashing into the sea, then the sand, and then through a fellow officer's back door. Later, he was caught in fog over the Tees, missed Hartlepool and narrowly escaped flying into a cliff. Shooting one's own propeller off with a forward-mounted machine-gun with malfunctioning synchronisation was a fairly common accident, and it happened to Johns twice. The Commanding Officer at Marske was a Major Champion, known as 'Gimlet', a name used later by Johns for the hero of a series of stories. During this time Johns's probationary commission was confirmed and he served as a flying instructor until August 1918 when he transferred to the Western Front.\n\nHe performed six weeks of active duty as a bomber pilot with No. 55 Squadron RAF, close to the average in the latter part of the war. This squadron was part of the Independent Air Force, a section of the Royal Air Force that had been formed for the purpose of bombing strategic targets deep inside Germany.\n\nOn 16 September 1918 he was piloting one of six De Havilland DH4s on their way to bomb Mannheim when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and he was forced to drop out of formation. He jettisoned his single bomb and turned for home, but was attacked by a number of Fokker D.VII fighters. During a lengthy but one-sided battle, Johns' observer and rear-gunner, Second Lieutenant Alfred Edward Amey, was badly wounded and the aircraft shot down. The victory was credited to Georg Weiner, the commander of Jagdstaffel 3. Johns and Amey were taken prisoner by German troops: Johns received a leg wound during the battle and was slightly injured in the crash, but Amey died of his injuries later that day. Johns was a prisoner of war until the end of the war (November 1918).\n\nAfter the war, Johns remained in the Royal Air Force, apparently with the substantive rank of Pilot Officer. His promotion to the rank of Flying Officer was gazetted on 23 November 1920. Johns worked in central London as a recruiting officer and rejected T. E. Lawrence (of Arabia) as an RAF recruit for obviously giving a false name, but was later ordered to accept him.\n\nBy 1923, Johns had left his wife. His RAF commission had been extended a further four years and he had moved to Birmingham, again working as a recruitment officer. In Birmingham he met Doris 'Dol' May Leigh (1900–1969), daughter of Alfred Broughton Leigh. They later moved to Newcastle upon Tyne when Johns was posted there. Although he never divorced Maude Hunt, Doris Leigh was known as 'Mrs Johns' until her death. Johns continued to pay for his wife and son's upkeep and for her nursing care (she suffered from acute arthritis).\n\nOn 15 October 1927, he was transferred to the reserves. Four years later, on 15 October 1931, he relinquished his commission.\n\nW. E. Johns was a prolific author and editor. In his 46-year writing career (1922–68) he penned over 160 books, including nearly one hundred Biggles books, more than sixty other novels and factual books, and scores of magazine articles and short stories.\n\nHis first novel, \"Mossyface\", was published in 1922 under the pen name \"William Earle\". After leaving the RAF, Johns became a newspaper air correspondent, as well as editing and illustrating books about flying. At the request of John Hamilton Ltd, he created the magazine \"Popular Flying\" which first appeared in March 1932. It was in the pages of \"Popular Flying\" that Biggles first appeared.\n\nThe first Biggles book, \"The Camels are Coming\" (a reference to the Sopwith Camel aeroplane), was published in August 1932 and Johns would continue to write Biggles stories until his death in 1968. At first, the Biggles stories were credited to \"William Earle\", but later Johns adopted the more familiar \"Capt. W. E. Johns\". While his apparent final RAF rank of flying officer was equivalent to an army (or RFC) lieutenant, captain is commonly used for the commander of a vessel or aircraft.\n\nJohns was also a regular contributor to \"Modern Boy\" magazine in the late 1930s as well as editing (and writing for) both \"Popular Flying\" and \"Flying\". From the early 1930s Johns called for the training of more pilots, for if there were not enough when war came, \"training would have to be rushed, and under-trained airmen would die in accidents or in combat against better trained German pilots.\" He was removed as editor at the beginning of 1939, probably as a direct result of a scathing editorial, strongly opposed to the policy of appeasement and highly critical of several Conservative statesmen of the time. Cockburn, however, feels that the government was concerned about being so \"expertly attacked\" on the lack of trained pilots by the editor of the most widely read aviation magazines in the world, including readers \"in the RAF or connected with flying.\"\n\nJohns' opposition to appeasement is reflected in some of his books. For example, in \"The Black Peril\" (1935) the storyline revolves around German preparations for conquest. Even more advanced in his thinking, for that time, was the story \"Biggles Air Commodore\" (1937) which alludes to Japanese preparations for conquest of British colonies in the Far East.\n\nApart from \"Biggles\", his other multi-volume fiction series were:\n\n\nJohns also wrote eight other books of juvenile fiction, twelve books of fiction for adults, and eight factual books, including several books on aviation, books on pirates and treasure hunting, and a book on gardening, \"The Passing Show\".\n\nUnusually among children's writers of the time, from 1935 Johns employed a working-class character as an equal member of the Biggles team – \"Ginger\" Habblethwaite, later Hebblethwaite, the son of a Northumberland miner. However, readers never learn his real Christian name, and he proclaims himself a Yorkshireman once or twice.\n\nW. E. Johns died on 21 June 1968 in his 76th year. Shortly before his death he was writing the final Biggles story, entitled \"Biggles does some Homework\", which shows Biggles at last preparing to retire, and meeting his mixed-race replacement. The twelve chapters written were issued privately in 1997. \n\nJohns' body was cremated at the Kingston-upon-Thames Crematorium, on Bonner Hill.\n\nFrom 1953 Johns resided at Park House, Hampton Court Road, at Hampton Court in Middlesex.\n\n\"By Jove, Biggles!\", a biography of Johns, was published in 1981, written by Peter Berresford Ellis and Piers Williams. It was republished as \"Biggles! The Life Story of Capt. W. E. Johns\" (Veloce Publishing, 1993, ).\n\n"}

{"id": "7148715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7148715", "title": "World War II in Yugoslavia", "text": "World War II in Yugoslavia\n\nMilitary operations in World War II in Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941, when the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was swiftly conquered by Axis forces and partitioned between Germany, Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria and client regimes. Subsequently, a guerrilla liberation war was fought against the Axis occupying forces and their locally established puppet regimes, including the Independent State of Croatia and the Serbian Government of National Salvation, by the Communist-led republican Yugoslav Partisans. Simultaneously, a multi-side civil war was waged between the Yugoslav communist Partisans, the Serbian royalist Chetniks, Croatian fascist Ustashe and Home Guard, as well as Slovene Home Guard troops.\n\nBoth the Yugoslav Partisans and the Chetnik movement initially resisted the occupation. However, after 1941, Chetniks extensively and systematically collaborated with the Italian occupation forces until the Italian capitulation, and thereon also with German and Ustashe forces. The Axis mounted a series of offensives intended to destroy the Partisans, coming close to doing so in the Battle of Neretva and Battle of Sutjeska in the spring and summer of 1943.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the Partisans remained a credible fighting force, with their organization gaining recognition from the Western Allies at the Tehran Conference and laying the foundations for the post-war Yugoslav state. With support in logistics and air power from the Western Allies, and Soviet ground troops in the Belgrade Offensive, the Partisans eventually gained control of the entire country and of the border regions of Trieste and Carinthia.\n\nThe human cost of the war was enormous. The number of war victims is still in dispute, but is generally agreed to have been at least one million. Non-combat victims included the majority of the country's Jewish population, many of whom perished in concentration and extermination camps (e.g. Jasenovac, Banjica) run by the client regimes.\n\nThe Ustashe regime (mostly Croats, but also Muslims and others) committed genocide against Serbs, Jews, Roma and anti-Fascist Croats. The Chetniks (mostly Serbs, but also Montenegrins and others) pursued genocide against Muslims, Croats and Pro-Partisan Serbs, and the Italian occupation authorities pursued violence and ethnic cleansing (Italianization) against Slovenes and Croats. The Wehrmacht carried out mass executions of civilians in retaliation for resistance activity e.g., the Kragujevac massacre. SS Division \"Prinz Eugen\" massacred large number of civilians and prisoners of war. Hungarian occupation troops massacred civilians (mostly Serbs and Jews) during the a major raid in southern Bačka, under the pretext of suppressing resistance activities.\n\nFinally, during and after the final stages of the war, Yugoslav authorities and Partisan troops carried out reprisals, including the deportation of the Danube Swabian population, forced marches and executions of thousands of captured soldiers and civilians (predominantly Croats associated with the NDH, but also Slovenes and others) fleeing their advance (the Bleiburg repatriations), atrocities against the Italian population in Istria (the Foibe massacres) and purges against Serbs, Hungarians and Germans associated with the fascist forces.\n\nPrior to the outbreak of war, the government of Milan Stojadinović (1935–1939) tried to navigate between the Axis Powers and the imperial powers by seeking neutral status, signing a non-aggression treaty with Italy and extending its treaty of friendship with France. In the same time, the country was destabilized by internal tensions, as Croatian leaders demanded a greater level of autonomy. Stojadinović was sacked by the regent Prince Paul in 1939 and replaced by Dragiša Cvetković, who negotiated a compromise with Croatian leader Vladko Maček in 1939, resulting in the formation of the Banovina of Croatia.\n\nHowever, rather than reducing tensions, the agreement only reinforced the crisis in the country's governance. Groups from both sides of the political spectrum were not satisfied: the pro-fascist Ustaše sought an independent Croatia allied with the Axis, Serbian public and military circles preferred alliance with the Western European empires, while the then-banned Communist Party of Yugoslavia saw the Soviet Union as a natural ally.\n\nAfter the fall of France to Nazi Germany in May 1940, the UK was the only empire in conflict with the Axis powers, and Prince Paul and the government saw no way of saving Yugoslavia except through adopting policies of accommodation with the Axis powers. Although Hitler was not particularly interested in creating another front in the Balkans, and Yugoslavia itself remained at peace during the first year of the war, Benito Mussolini's Italy had invaded Albania in April 1939 and launched the rather unsuccessful Italo-Greek War in October 1940. These events resulted in Yugoslavia's geographical isolation from potential Allied support. The government tried to negotiate with the Axis on cooperation with as few concessions as possible, while attempting secret negotiations with the Allies and the Soviet Union, but those moves would fail to keep the country out of the war. A secret mission to the US, led by the influential Serbian-Jewish Captain David Albala with the purpose of obtaining funding to buy arms for the expected invasion went nowhere, while Stalin expelled Yugoslav Ambassador Gavrilovic just one month after agreeing a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia.\n\nHaving steadily fallen within the orbit of the Axis during 1940 after events such as the Second Vienna Award, Yugoslavia followed Bulgaria and formally joined the Axis powers by signing the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. Air force officers opposed to the move staged a coup d'état and took over in the following days. These events were viewed with great apprehension in Berlin, and as it was preparing to help its Italian ally in its war against Greece anyway, the plans were modified to include Yugoslavia as well.\n\nOn 6 April 1941 the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was invaded from all sides by the Axis powers of Germany, Italy, and their ally Hungary.\nDuring the invasion, Belgrade was bombed by the German air force (\"Luftwaffe\"). The invasion lasted little more than ten days, ending with the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April. Besides being hopelessly ill-equipped when compared to the German Army (\"Heer\"), the Yugoslav army attempted to defend all borders but only managed to thinly spread the limited resources available. Also, large numbers of the population refused to fight, instead welcoming the Germans as liberators from government oppression. However, as this meant each individual ethnic group would turn to movements opposed to the unity promoted by the South Slavic state, two different concepts of resistance emerged, the monarchist Chetniks, and the communist Partisans.\n\nTwo of the principal constituent national groups, Slovenes and Croats, were not prepared to fight in defense of a Yugoslav state with a continued Serb monarchy. The only effective opposition to the invasion was from units wholly from Serbia itself. The Serbian General Staff was united on the question of Yugoslavia as a \"Greater Serbia\" ruled, in one way or another, by Serbia. On the eve of the invasion, there were 165 generals on the Yugoslav active list. Of these, all but four were Serbs.\n\nThe terms of the capitulation were extremely severe, as the Axis proceeded to dismember Yugoslavia. Germany annexed northern Slovenia, while retaining direct occupation over a rump Serbian state, and considerable influence over its newly created puppet state, the Independent State of Croatia, which extended over much of today's Croatia and contained all of modern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mussolini's Italy gained the remainder of Slovenia, Kosovo, and large chunks of the coastal Dalmatia region (along with nearly all of the Adriatic islands and the Bay of Kotor). It also gained control over the Italian governorate of Montenegro, and was granted the kingship in the Independent State of Croatia, though wielding little real power within it. Hungary dispatched the Hungarian Third Army to occupy Vojvodina in northern Serbia, and later forcibly annexed sections of Baranja, Bačka, Međimurje, and Prekmurje.\n\nThe Bulgarian army moved in on 19 April 1941, occupying nearly all of the modern-day Republic of Macedonia and some districts of eastern Serbia which, with Greek western Thrace and eastern Macedonia (the Aegean Province), were annexed by Bulgaria on 14 May.\n\nThe government in exile was now only recognized by the Allied powers. The Axis had recognized the territorial acquisitions of their allied states.\n\nVarious military formations more or less linked to the general liberation movement were involved in armed confrontations with Axis forces which erupted in various areas of Yugoslavia in the ensuing weeks. \nFrom the start, the Yugoslav resistance forces consisted of two factions: the Partisans, a communist-led movement propagating pan-Yugoslav tolerance (\"brotherhood and unity\") and incorporating republican, left-wing and liberal elements of Yugoslav politics, on one hand, and the Chetniks, a conservative royalist and nationalist force, enjoying support almost exclusively from the Serbian population in occupied Yugoslavia, on the other hand. Initially the Chetniks received recognition from the Western Allies, while the Partisans were supported by the Soviet Union.\n\nAt the very beginning, the Partisan forces were relatively small, poorly armed, and without any infrastructure. But they had two major advantages over other military and paramilitary formations in former Yugoslavia: the first and most immediate advantage was a small but valuable cadre of Spanish Civil War veterans. Unlike some of the other military and paramilitary formations, these veterans had experience with a modern war fought in circumstances quite similar to those found in World War II Yugoslavia. In Slovenia, the Partisans likewise drew on the experienced TIGR members to train troops.\n\nTheir other major advantage, which became more apparent in later stages of War, was in the Partisans being founded on a socialist ideology rather than ethnicity. Therefore, they won support that crossed national lines, meaning they could expect at least some levels of support in almost any corner of the country, unlike other paramilitary formations limited to territories with Croat or Serb majority. This allowed their units to be more mobile and fill their ranks with a larger pool of potential recruits.\n\nAlthough the activity of the Macedonian and Slovene Partisans were part of the Yugoslav People's Liberation War, the specific conditions in Macedonia and Slovenia, due to the strong autonomist tendencies of the local communists, led to the creation of a separate sub-armies called the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia, and Slovene Partisans led by Liberation Front of the Slovene People, respectively.\n\nThe most numerous local force, besides the four second-line German Wehrmacht infantry divisions assigned to occupation duties was the Croatian Home Guard (\"Hrvatsko domobranstvo\"), founded in April 1941, a few days after the founding of the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) itself. It was done with the authorisation of German occupation authorities. The task of the new Croatian armed forces was to defend the new state against both foreign and domestic enemies.\n\nThe Croatian Home Guard was originally limited to 16 infantry battalions and 2 cavalry squadrons – 16,000 men in total. The original 16 battalions were soon enlarged to 15 infantry regiments of two battalions each between May and June 1941, organised into five divisional commands, some 55,000 enlisted men. Support units included 35 light tanks supplied by Italy, 10 artillery battalions (equipped with captured Royal Yugoslav Army weapons of Czech origin), a cavalry regiment in Zagreb and an independent cavalry battalion at Sarajevo. Two independent motorized infantry battalions were based at Zagreb and Sarajevo respectively. Several regiments of Ustaše militia were also formed at this time, which operated under a separate command structure to, and independently from, the Croatian Home Guard, until late 1944. The Home Guard crushed the Serb revolt in Eastern Herzegovina in June 1941, and in July they fought in Eastern and Western Bosnia. They fought in Eastern Herzegovina again, when Croatian-Dalmatian and Slavonian battalions reinforced local units.\n\nThe Italian High Command assigned 24 divisions and three coastal brigades to occupation duties in Yugoslavia from 1941. These units were located from Slovenia, Croatia and Dalmatia through to Montenegro and Kosovo.\n\nFrom 1931-39, the Soviet Union had prepared communists for a guerrilla war in Yugoslavia. On the eve of the war, hundreds of future prominent Yugoslav communist leaders completed special \"partisan courses\" organized by the Soviet military intelligence in the Soviet Union and Spain. Operation Barbarossa, the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941. On the same day, Yugoslav Partisans formed the 1st Sisak Partisan Detachment, was the first armed anti-fascist resistance unit formed by a resistance movement in occupied Yugoslavia during World War II. Founded in the Brezovica Forest near Sisak, Croatia, its creation marked the beginning of anti-Axis resistance in occupied Yugoslavia.\n\nAfter the German attack on the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia formally decided to launch an armed uprising on 4 July 1941, a date which was later marked as Fighter's Day – a public holiday in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In the village of Bela Crkva, Spanish veteran Žikica Jovanović Španac shot the first bullet of the campaign on 7 July 1941, a date that later became known as the \"Day of Uprising of the Socialist Republic of Serbia\". On 10 August 1941 in Stanulović, a mountain village, the Partisans formed the Kopaonik Partisan Detachment Headquarters. Their liberated area, consisting of nearby villages and called the \"Miners Republic\", was the first in Yugoslavia, and lasted 42 days. The resistance fighters formally joined the ranks of the Partisans later on.\n\nThe Chetnik movement was organized after the surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army by some of the remaining Yugoslav soldiers. This force was organized in the Ravna Gora district of western Serbia under Colonel Draža Mihailović. However, unlike the Partisans, Mihailović's forces were almost entirely ethnic Serbs. He directed his units to arm themselves and await his orders for the final push. Mihailović avoided direct action against the Axis, which he judged were of low strategic importance.\n\nThe royalist Chetniks (officially the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, JVUO), under the command of General Draža Mihailović, drew primarily from the scattered remnants of the Royal Yugoslav Army, relying overwhelmingly on the ethnic Serbian population for support. They were formed soon after the invasion of Yugoslavia and the surrender of the government on 17 April 1941. The Chetniks were initially the only resistance movement recognized by the Yugoslav government-in-exile and the Western Allies. The Partisans and Chetniks attempted to cooperate early during the conflict, but this quickly fell apart.\nIn September 1941, Partisans organized sabotage at the General Post Office in Zagreb.\nAs the levels of resistance to its occupation grew, the Axis Powers responded with numerous minor offensives. There were also seven major Axis operations specifically aimed at eliminating all or most Yugoslav Partisan resistance. These major offensives were typically combined efforts by the German Wehrmacht and SS, Italy, Chetniks, the Independent State of Croatia, the Serbian collaborationist government, Bulgaria, and Hungary.\n\nThe First Anti-Partisan Offensive was the attack conducted by the Axis in autumn of 1941 against the \"Republic of Užice\", a liberated territory the Partisans established in western Serbia. In November 1941, German troops attacked and reoccupied this territory, with the majority of Partisan forces escaping towards Bosnia. It was during this offensive that tenuous collaboration between the Partisans and the royalist Chetnik movement broke down and turned into open hostility.\n\nAfter fruitless negotiations, the Chetnik leader, General Mihailović, turned against the Partisans as his main enemy. According to him, the reason was humanitarian: the prevention of German reprisals against Serbs. This however, did not stop the activities of the Partisan resistance, and Chetnik units attacked the Partisans in November 1941, while increasingly receiving supplies and cooperating with the Germans and Italians in this. The British liaison to Mihailović advised London to stop supplying the Chetniks after the Užice attack (see First Anti-Partisan Offensive), but Britain continued to do so.\n\nOn 22 December 1941 the Partisans formed the 1st Proletarian Assault Brigade (\"1. Proleterska Udarna Brigada\") – the first regular Partisan military unit capable of operating outside its local area. 22 December became the \"Day of the Yugoslav People's Army\".\n\nOn 15 January 1942, the Bulgarian 1st Army, with 3 infantry divisions, transferred to south-eastern Serbia. Headquartered at Niš, it replaced German divisions needed in Croatia and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Chetniks initially enjoyed the support of the Western Allies (up to the Tehran Conference in December 1943). In 1942, \"Time Magazine\" featured an article which praised the \"success\" of Mihailović's Chetniks and heralded him as the sole defender of freedom in Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\nTito's Partisans fought the Germans more actively during this time. Tito and Mihailović had a bounty of 100,000 Reichsmarks offered by Germans for their heads. While \"officially\" remaining mortal enemies of the Germans and the Ustaše, the Chetniks were known for making clandestine deals with the Italians and other occupying forces. The Second Enemy Offensive was a coordinated Axis attack conducted in January 1942 against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia. The Partisan troops once again avoided encirclement and were forced to retreat over the Igman mountain near Sarajevo.\n\nThe Third Enemy Offensive, an offensive against Partisan forces in eastern Bosnia, Montenegro, Sandžak and Hercegovina which took place in the spring of 1942. It was known as \"Operation TRIO\" by the Germans, and again ended with a timely Partisan escape. This attack is mistakenly identified by some sources as the Battle of Kozara, which took place in the summer of 1942.\n\nThe Partisans fought an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the Axis occupiers and their local collaborators, including the Chetniks (which they also considered collaborators). They enjoyed gradually increased levels of success and support of the general populace, and succeeded in controlling large chunks of Yugoslav territory. People's committees were organized to act as civilian governments in areas of the country liberated by the Partisans. In places, even limited arms industries were set up.\n\nTo gather intelligence, agents of the Western Allies were infiltrated into both the Partisans and the Chetniks. The intelligence gathered by liaisons to the resistance groups was crucial to the success of supply missions and was the primary influence on Allied strategy in the Yugoslavia. The search for intelligence ultimately resulted in the decline of the Chetniks and their eclipse by Tito's Partisans. In 1942, though supplies were limited, token support was sent equally to each. In November 1942, Partisan detachments were officially merged into the People's Liberation Army and Partisan Detachments of Yugoslavia (\"NOV i POJ\").\n\nIn the first half of 1943 two Axis offensives came close to defeating the Partisans. They are known by their German code names Fall Weiss \"(Case White)\" and Fall Schwarz \"(Case Black)\", as the Battle of Neretva and the Battle of Sutjeska after the rivers in the areas they were fought, or the Fourth and Fifth Enemy Offensive, respectively, according to former Yugoslav historiography.\n\nOn 7 January 1943, the Bulgarian 1st Army also occupied south-west Serbia. Savage pacification measures reduced Partisan activity appreciably. Bulgarian infantry divisions participated in the Fifth anti-Partisan Offensive as a blocking force of the Partisan escape-route from Montenegro into Serbia and in the Sixth anti-Partisan Offensive in Eastern Bosnia.\n\nNegotiations between Germans and Partisans started on 11 March 1943 in Gornji Vakuf, Bosnia. Tito's key officers Vladimir Velebit, Koča Popović and Milovan Đilas brought three proposals, first about an exchange of prisoners, second about the implementation of international law on treatment of prisoners and third about political questions. The delegation expressed concerns about the Italian involvement in supplying the Chetnik army and stated that the National Liberation Movement is an independent movement, with no aid from the Soviet Union or the UK. Somewhat later, Đilas and Velebit were brought to Zagreb to continue the negotiations.\n\nIn the Fourth Enemy Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Neretva or \"Fall Weiss\" (Case White), Axis forces pushed Partisan troops to retreat from western Bosnia to northern Herzegovina, culminating in the Partisan retreat over the Neretva river. It took place from January to April, 1943.\n\nThe Fifth Enemy Offensive, also known as the Battle of the Sutjeska or \"Fall Schwarz\" (Case Black), immediately followed the Fourth Offensive and included a complete encirclement of Partisan forces in southeastern Bosnia and northern Montenegro in May and June 1943.\n\nThe Croatian Home Guard reached its maximum size at the end of 1943, when it had 130,000 men. It also included an air force, the Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia (\"Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske\", or ZNDH), the backbone of which was provided by 500 former Royal Yugoslav Air Force officers and 1,600 NCOs with 125 aircraft. By 1943 the ZNDH was 9,775 strong and equipped with 295 aircraft.\n\nOn 8 September 1943, the Italians concluded an armistice with the Allies, leaving 17 divisions stranded in Yugoslavia. All divisional commanders refused to join the Germans. Two Italian infantry divisions joined the Montenegrin Partisans as complete units, while another joined the Albanian Partisans. Other units surrendered to the Germans to face imprisonment in Germany or summary execution. Others surrendered themselves, arms, ammunition and equipment to Croatian forces or to the Partisans, simply disintegrated, or reached Italy on foot via Trieste or by ship across the Adriatic. The Italian Governorship of Dalmatia was disestablished and the country's possessions were subsequently divided between Germany, which established its Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, and the Independent State of Croatia, which established the new district of Sidraga-Ravni Kotari. The former Italian kingdoms of Albania and of Montenegro were placed under German occupation.\n\nThe events, which occurred in 1943 would bring about change in the attitude of the Allies. The Germans were executing Operation Schwarz (Battle of Sutjeska, the Fifth anti-Partisan offensive), one of a series of offensives aimed at the resistance fighters, when F.W.D. Deakin was sent by the British to gather information. His reports contained two important observations. The first was that the Partisans were courageous and aggressive in battling the German 1st Mountain and 104th Light Division, had suffered significant casualties, and required support. The second observation was that the entire German 1st Mountain Division had transited from the Soviet Union on rail lines through Chetnik-controlled territory. British intercepts (ULTRA) of German message traffic confirmed Chetnik timidity. Even though today many circumstances, facts, and motivations remain unclear, intelligence reports resulted in increased Allied interest in Yugoslavia air operations and shifted policy.\n\nThe Sixth Enemy Offensive was a series of operations undertaken by the Wehrmacht and the Ustaše after the capitulation of Italy in an attempt to secure the Adriatic coast. It took place in the autumn and winter of 1943/1944.\n\nAt this point the Partisans were able to win the moral, as well as limited material support of the Western Allies, who until then had supported General Draža Mihailović's Chetnik Forces, but were finally convinced of their collaboration by many intelligence-gathering missions dispatched to both sides during the course of the war.\n\nIn September 1943, at Churchill's request, Brigadier General Fitzroy Maclean was parachuted to Tito's headquarters near Drvar to serve as a permanent, formal liaison to the Partisans. While the Chetniks were still occasionally supplied, the Partisans received the bulk of all future support.\n\nWhen the AVNOJ (the Partisan wartime council in Yugoslavia) was eventually recognized by the Allies, by late 1943, the official recognition of the Partisan Democratic Federal Yugoslavia soon followed. The National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia was recognized by the major Allied powers at the Tehran Conference, when United States agreed to the position of other Allied. The newly recognized Yugoslav government, headed by Prime Minister Josip Broz Tito, was a joint body formed of AVNOJ members and the members of the former government-in-exile in London. The resolution of a fundamental question, whether the new state remained a monarchy or was to be a republic, was postponed until the end of the war, as was the status of King Peter II.\n\nSubsequent to switching their support to the Partisans, the Allies set-up the RAF Balkan Air Force (under the suggestion of Brigadier-General Fitzroy Maclean) with the aim to provide increased supplies and tactical air support for Marshal Tito's Partisan forces.\n\nIn January 1944, Tito's forces unsuccessfully attacked Banja Luka. But, while Tito was forced to withdraw, Mihajlović and his forces were also noted by the Western press for their lack of activity.\n\nThe Seventh Enemy Offensive was the final Axis attack in western Bosnia in the spring of 1944, which included \"Operation Rösselsprung\" (Knight's Leap), an unsuccessful attempt to eliminate Josip Broz Tito personally and annihilate the leadership of the Partisan movement.\n\nAllied aircraft specifically started targeting ZNDH (Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia) and Luftwaffe bases and aircraft for the first time as a result of the Seventh Offensive, including \"Operation Rösselsprung\" in late May 1944. Up until then Axis aircraft could fly inland almost at will, as long as they remained at low altitude. Partisan units on the ground frequently complained about enemy aircraft attacking them while hundreds of Allied aircraft flew above at higher altitude. This changed during \"Rösselsprung\" as Allied fighter-bombers went low en-masse for the first time, establishing full aerial superiority. Consequently, both the ZNDH and Luftwaffe were forced to limit their operations in clear weather to early morning and late afternoon hours.\n\nThe Yugoslav Partisan movement grew to become the largest resistance force in occupied Europe, with 800,000 men organized in 4 field armies. Eventually the Partisans prevailed against all of their opponents as the official army of the newly founded Democratic Federal Yugoslavia (later Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia).\n\nIn 1944, the Macedonian and Serbian commands made contact in southern Serbia and formed a joint command, which consequently placed the Macedonian Partisans under the direct command of Marshal Josip Broz Tito. The Slovene Partisans also merged with Tito's forces in 1944.\n\nOn 16 June 1944, the Tito-Šubašić agreement between the Partisans and the Yugoslavian Government in exile of King Peter II was signed on the island of Vis. This agreement was an attempt to form a new Yugoslav government which would include both the communists and the royalists. It called for a merge of the Partisan Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia (\"Antifašističko V(ij)eće Narodnog Oslobođenja Jugoslavije\", AVNOJ) and the Government in exile. The Tito-Šubašić agreement also called on all Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs to join the Partisans. The Partisans were recognized by the Royal Government as Yugoslavia's regular army. Mihajlović and many Chetniks refused to answer the call. The Chetniks were, however, praised for saving 500 downed Allied pilots in 1944; United States President Harry S. Truman posthumously awarded Mihailović the Legion of Merit for his contribution to the Allied victory.\n\nIn August 1944 after the Jassy-Kishinev Offensive overwhelmed the front line of Germany's Army Group South Ukraine, King Michael I of Romania staged a coup, Romania quit the war, and the Romanian army was placed under the command of the Red Army. Romanian forces, fighting against Germany, participated in the Prague Offensive. Bulgaria quit as well and, on 10 September, declared war on Germany and its remaining allies. The weak divisions sent by the Axis powers to invade Bulgaria were easily driven back. In Macedonia, the Bulgarian troops, surrounded by German forces and betrayed by high-ranking military commanders, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. In Late September 1944 three Bulgarian armies, some 455,000 strong in total led by General Georgi Marinov Mandjev from the village of Goliamo Sharkovo – Elhovo, entered Yugoslavia with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. Southern and eastern Serbia and Macedonia were liberated within two months and the 130,000-strong Bulgarian First Army continued to Hungary.\n\nOn 10 September 1944, Bulgaria changed sides and declared war on Germany as an Allied Power. The Germans swiftly disarmed the 1st Occupation Corps of 5 divisions and the 5th Army, despite short-lived resistance by the latter. Survivors retreated to the old borders of Bulgaria. After the occupation of Bulgaria by the Soviet army negotiations between Tito and the Bulgarian Communist leaders were organized, resulting in a military alliance between them. The new Bulgarian Peoples Army and the Red Army 3rd Ukrainian Front troops were concentrated at the old Bulgarian-Yugoslav border. On 8 October, they entered Yugoslavia. The First and Fourth Bulgarian Armies invaded Vardar Macedonia, and the Second Army south-eastern Serbia. The First Army then swung north with the Soviet 3rd Ukrainian Front, through eastern Yugoslavia and south-western Hungary, before linking up with the British 8th Army in Austria in May 1945.\n\nConcurrently, with Allied air support and assistance from the Red Army, the Partisans turned their attention to Central Serbia. The chief objective was to disrupt railroad communications in the valleys of the Vardar and Morava rivers, and prevent Germans from withdrawing their 300,000+ forces from Greece.\n\nThe Allied air forces sent 1,973 aircraft (mostly from the US 15th Air Force) over Yugoslavia, which discharged over 3,000 tons of bombs. On 17 August 1944 Marshal Josip Broz Tito offered an amnesty to all collaborators. On 12 September, King Peter broadcast a message from London, calling upon all Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to \"join the National Liberation Army under the leadership of Marshal Tito\". The message had a devastating effect on the morale of the Chetniks. Many of them switched sides to the Partisans.\n\nIn September, the Red Army and the Partisans launched the Belgrade Offensive, and took the city on 20 October. At the onset of winter, the Partisans effectively controlled the entire eastern half of Yugoslavia—Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro—as well as most of the Dalmatian coast. The Wehrmacht and the forces of the Ustaše-controlled Independent State of Croatia fortified a front in Syrmia that held through the winter of 1944–45 in order to aid the evacuation of German Army Group E from the Balkans. To raise the number of Partisan troops Tito again offered the amnesty on 21 November 1944. In November 1944, the units of the Ustaše militia and the Croatian Home Guard were reorganized and combined to form the Army of the Independent State of Croatia.\n\nThe Germans continued their retreat. Having lost the easier withdrawal route through Serbia, they fought to hold the Syrmian front in order to secure the more difficult passage through Kosovo, Sandzak and Bosnia. They even scored a series of temporary successes against the People's Liberation Army. They left Mostar on 22 February 1945. They did not leave Sarajevo until 15 April. Sarajevo had assumed a last-moment strategic position as the only remaining withdrawal route and was held at substantial cost. In early March the Germans moved troops from southern Bosnia to support an unsuccessful counter-offensive in Hungary, which enabled the NOV to score some successes by attacking the Germans' weakened positions. Although strengthened by Allied aid, a secure rear and mass conscription in areas under their control, the one-time partisans found it difficult to switch to conventional warfare, particularly in the open country west of Belgrade, where the Germans held their own until mid-April in spite of all of the raw and untrained conscripts the NOV hurled in a bloody war of attrition against the Syrmian Front.\n\nOn 8 March 1945, a coalition Yugoslav government was formed in Belgrade with Tito as Premier and Ivan Šubašić as Foreign Minister.\n\nOn 20 March 1945, the Partisans launched a general offensive in the Mostar-Višegrad-Drina sector. With large swaths of Bosnian, Croatian and Slovenian countryside already under Partisan guerrilla control, the final operations consisted in connecting these territories and capturing major cities and roads. For the general offensive Marshal Josip Broz Tito commanded a Partisan force of about 800,000 men organized into four armies: the 1st Army commanded by Peko Dapčević, 2nd Army commanded by Koča Popović, 3rd Army commanded by Kosta Nađ, and the 4th Army commanded by Petar Drapšin. In addition, the Yugoslav Partisans had eight independent army corps (the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 9th, and the 10th).\n\nSet against the Yugoslav Partisans was German General Alexander Löhr of Army Group E (\"Heeresgruppe E\"). This Army Group had seven army corps (the XV Mountain, XV Cossack, XXI Mountain, XXXIV, LXIX, and LXXXXVII). These corps included seventeen weakened divisions (1st Cossack, 2nd Cossack, 7th SS, 11th Luftwaffe Field Division, 22nd, 41st, 104th, 117th, 138th, 181st, 188th, 237th, 297th, 369th Croat, 373rd Croat, 392nd Croat and the 14th SS Ukrainian Division). In addition to the seven corps, the Axis had remnant naval and Luftwaffe forces, under constant attack by the British Royal Navy, Royal Air Force and United States Air Force.\n\nThe army of the Independent State of Croatia was at the time composed of eighteen divisions: 13 infantry, two mountain, two assault and one replacement Croatian Divisions, each with its own organic artillery and other support units. There were also several armoured units. From early 1945, the Croatian Divisions were allocated to various German corps and by March 1945 were holding the Southern Front. Securing the rear areas were some 32,000 men of the Croatian gendarmerie (\"Hrvatsko Oruznistvo\"), organised into 5 Police Volunteer Regiments plus 15 independent battalions, equipped with standard light infantry weapons, including mortars.\n\nThe Air Force of the Independent State of Croatia (\"Zrakoplovstvo Nezavisne Države Hrvatske\", or ZNDH) and the units of the Croatian Air Force Legion (\"Hrvatska Zrakoplovna Legija\", or HZL), returned from service on the Eastern Front provided some level of air support (attack, fighter and transport) right up until May 1945, encountering and sometimes defeating opposing aircraft from the British Royal Air Force, United States Air Force and the Soviet Air Force. Although 1944 had been a catastrophic year for the ZNDH, with aircraft losses amounting to 234, primarily on the ground, it entered 1945 with 196 machines. Further deliveries of new aircraft from Germany continued in the early months of 1945 to replace losses. By 10 March, the ZNDH had 23 Messerschmitt 109 G&Ks, three Morane-Saulnier M.S.406, six Fiat G.50, and two Messerschmitt 110 G fighters. The final deliveries of up-to-date German Messerschmitt 109 G and K fighter aircraft were still taking place in March 1945. and the ZNDH still had 176 aircraft on its strength in April 1945.\n\nBetween 30 March and 8 April 1945, General Mihailović's Chetniks mounted a final attempt to establish themselves as a credible force fighting the Axis in Yugoslavia. The Chetniks under Lieutenant Colonel Pavle Đurišić fought a combination of Ustaša and Croatian Home Guard forces in the Battle on Lijevča field. In late March 1945 elite NDH Army units were withdrawn from the Syrmian front to destroy Djurisic's Chetniks trying to make their way across the northern NDH. The battle was fought near Banja Luka in what was then the Independent State of Croatia and ended in a decisive victory for the Independent State of Croatia forces.\n\nSerbian units included the remnants of the Serbian State Guard and the Serbian Volunteer Corps from the Serbian Military Administration. There were even some units of the Slovene Home Guard (\"Slovensko domobranstvo\", SD) still intact in Slovenia.\n\nBy the end of March, 1945, it was obvious to the Croatian Army Command that, although the front remained intact, they would eventually be defeated by sheer lack of ammunition. For this reason, the decision was made to retreat into Austria, in order to surrender to the British forces advancing north from Italy. The German Army was in the process of disintegration and the supply system lay in ruins.\n\nBihać was liberated by the Partisans the same day that the general offensive was launched. The 4th Army, under the command of Petar Drapšin, broke through the defences of the XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps. By 20 April, Drapšin liberated Lika and the Croatian Littoral, including the islands, and reached the old Yugoslav border with Italy. On 1 May, after capturing the Italian territories of Rijeka and Istria from the German LXXXXVII Corps, the Yugoslav 4th Army beat the western Allies to Trieste by one day.\n\nThe Yugoslav 2nd Army, under the command of Koča Popović, forced a crossing of the Bosna River on 5 April, capturing Doboj, and reached the Una River. On 6 April, the 2nd, 3rd, and 5th Corps of the Yugoslav Partisans took Sarajevo from the German XXI Corps. On 12 April, the Yugoslav 3rd Army, under the command of Kosta Nađ, forced a crossing of the Drava river. The 3rd Army then fanned out through Podravina, reached a point north of Zagreb, and crossed the old Austrian border with Yugoslavia in the Dravograd sector. The 3rd Army closed the ring around the enemy forces when its advanced motorized detachments linked up with detachments of the 4th Army in Carinthia.\n\nAlso, on 12 April, the Yugoslav 1st Army, under the command of Peko Dapčević penetrated the fortified front of the German XXXIV Corps in Syrmia. By 22 April, the 1st Army had smashed the fortifications and was advancing towards Zagreb.\n\nThe long-drawn out liberation of western Yugoslavia caused more victims among the population. The breakthrough of the Syrmian front on 12 April was, in Milovan Đilas's words, \"the greatest and bloodiest battle our army had ever fought\", and it would not have been possible had it not been for Soviet instructors and arms.\nBy the time General Peko Dapčević's NOV units had reached Zagreb, on 9 May 1945, they had perhaps lost as many as 36,000 dead. There were by then over 400,000 refugees in Zagreb. After entering Zagreb with the Yugoslav 2nd Army, both armies advanced in Slovenia.\n\nOn 2 May, the German capital city, Berlin, fell to the Red Army. On 8 May 1945, the Germans surrendered unconditionally and the war in Europe officially ended. The Italians had quit the war in 1943, the Bulgarians in 1944, and the Hungarians earlier in 1945. Despite the German capitulation, however, sporadic fighting still took place in Yugoslavia. On 7 May, Zagreb was evacuated, on 9 May, Maribor and Ljubljana were captured by the Partisans, and General Alexander Löhr, Commander-in-Chief of Army Group E was forced to sign the total surrender of the forces under his command at Topolšica, near Velenje, Slovenia, on Wednesday 9 May 1945. Only the Croatian and other anti-Partisan forces remained.\n\nFrom 10 to 15 May, the Yugoslav Partisans continued to face resistance from Croatian, and other anti-Partisan forces throughout the rest of Croatia and Slovenia. The Battle of Poljana, the last battle of World War II in Europe, started on 14 May, ending on 15 May 1945 at Poljana, near Prevalje in Slovenia. It was the culmination and last of a series of battles between Yugoslav Partisans and a large (in excess of 30,000) mixed column of German Army (\"Heer\") soldiers together with Croatian Ustaše, Croatian Home Guard, Slovenian Home Guard, and other anti-Partisan forces who were attempting to retreat to Austria.\n\nOn 5 May, in the town of Palmanova (50 km northwest of Trieste), between 2,400 and 2,800 members of the Serbian Volunteer Corps surrendered to the British. On 12 May, about 2,500 additional Serbian Volunteer Corps members surrendered to the British at Unterbergen on the Drava River.\nOn 11 and 12 May, British troops in Klagenfurt, Austria, were harassed by arriving forces of the Yugoslav Partisans. In Belgrade, the British ambassador to the Yugoslav coalition government handed Tito a note demanding that the Yugoslav troops withdraw from Austria.\n\nOn 15 May 1945 a large column of the Croatian Home Guard, the Ustaše, the XVth SS Cossack Cavalry Corps and the remnants of the Serbian State Guard, and the Serbian Volunteer Corps, arrived at the southern Austrian border near the town of Bleiburg. The representatives of the Independent State of Croatia attempted to negotiate a surrender to the British under the terms of the Geneva Convention that they had joined in 1943, and were recognised by it as a \"belligerent\", but were ignored. Most of the people in the column were turned over to the Yugoslav government as part of what is sometimes referred to as Operation Keelhaul. Following the Bleiburg repatriations, the Partisans proceeded to brutalize the POWs.\n\nOn 15 May, Tito had placed Partisan forces in Austria under Allied control. A few days later he agreed to withdraw them. By 20 May, Yugoslav troops in Austria had begun to withdraw. On 8 June, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Yugoslavia agreed on the control of Trieste. On 11 November, parliamentary elections were held in Yugoslavia. In these elections the communists had an important advantage because they controlled the police, judiciary and media. For that reason the opposition did not want to participate in the elections. On 29 November, in accordance with election result, Peter II was deposed by communist dominated Yugoslavia's Constituent Assembly. On the same day, the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was established as a socialist state during the first meeting of the Yugoslav Parliament in Belgrade. Josip Broz Tito was appointed Prime Minister. The autonomist wing in the Communist Party of Macedonia, which dominated during World War II, was finally pushed aside in 1945 after the Second Assembly of the ASNOM.\n\nOn 13 March 1946, Mihailović was captured by agents of the Yugoslav Department of National Security (\"Odsjek Zaštite Naroda\" or OZNA). From 10 June to 15 July of the same year, he was tried for high treason and war crimes. On 15 July, he was found guilty and sentenced to death by firing squad.\n\nOn 16 July, a clemency appeal was rejected by the Presidium of the National Assembly. During the early hours of 18 July, Mihailović, together with nine other Chetnik and Nedić's officers, was executed in Lisičiji Potok. This execution essentially ended the World War II-era civil war between the communist Partisans and the royalist Chetniks.\n\nThe Yugoslav government estimated the number of casualties to be at 1,704,000 and submitted the figure to the International Reparations Commission in 1946 without any documentation. The figure included war related deaths but also the expected population if war did not break out, the number of unborn children, and losses from emigration and disease. The same figure was later submitted to the Allied Reparations Committee in 1948 but was claimed to be only from war related deaths. After Germany requested verifiable data the Yugoslav Federal Bureau of Statistics created a nationwide survey in 1964. The total number of those killed was found to be 597,323. The list stayed a state secret until 1989 when it was published for the first time.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of the Census published a report in 1954 that concluded that Yugoslav war related deaths were 1,067,000. The U.S. Bureau of the Census noted that the official Yugoslav government figure of 1.7 million war dead was overstated because it \"was released soon after the war and was estimated without the benefit of a postwar census\". A study by Vladimir Žerjavić estimates total war related deaths at 1,027,000. Military losses are estimated at 237,000 Yugoslav partisans and 209,000 collaborators, while civilian losses at 581,000, including 57,000 Jews. Losses of the Yugoslav Republics were Bosnia 316,000; Serbia 273,000; Croatia 271,000; Slovenia 33,000; Montenegro 27,000; Macedonia 17,000; and killed abroad 80,000. Statistician Bogoljub Kočović calculated that the actual war losses were 1,014,000. The late Jozo Tomasevich, Professor Emeritus of Economics at San Francisco State University, believes that the calculations of Kočović and Žerjavić \"seem to be free of bias, we can accept them as reliable\". Stjepan Mestrovic estimates that about 850,000 people were killed in the war. Vego cites figures from 900,000 to a million dead. Stephen R. A'Barrow estimates that the war caused 446,000 dead soldiers and 514,000 dead civilians, or 960,000 dead in total from the Yugoslav population out of 15 million. \n\nThe reasons for the high human toll in Yugoslavia were as follows:\n\nChetniks carried out massacres against Muslims in Bosnia and Sandžak and Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, northern Dalmatia, and Lika. Jews were partly killed in camps throughout Yugoslavia and partly in camps in Germany, Norway and Greece after deportation. In the Province of Ljubljana, Italian authorities led by Mario Roatta terrorized the Slovene civilian population and deported them to concentration camps with the goal of Italianizing the area. The large numbers of casualties as a result of the ethnic cleansing the local populace committed on one another, along with the especially brutal methods of execution used-mass hangings, clubbing to death, setting fire to buildings with people inside, etc.,-led even the Germans occupying the area to express shock at the violence. Mass killings by partisan purges and at Bleiburg were done for both political and ethnic reasons. Most victims were either killed for association with fascist forces such as soldiers and collaborators or were civilians of ethnic groups associated with the fascist forces such as Hungarian, German and Italian.\n\nIn Slovenia, the Institute for Contemporary History, Ljubljana launched a comprehensive research on the exact number of victims of World War II in Slovenia in 1995. After more than a decade of research, the final report was published in 2005, which included a list of names. The number of victims was set at 89,404. The figure also includes the victims of summary killings by the Communist regime immediately after the war (around 13,500 people). The results of the research came as a shock for the public, since the actual figures were more than 30% higher than the highest estimates during the Yugoslav period. Even counting only the number of deaths up to May 1945 (thus excluding the military prisoners killed by the Yugoslav Army between May and July 1945), the number remains considerably higher than the highest previous estimates (around 75,000 deaths versus a previous estimate of 60,000).\n\nThere are several reasons for such a difference. The new comprehensive research also included Slovenes killed by the Partisan resistance, both in battle (members of collaborationist and anti-Communist units), and civilians (around 4,000 between 1941 and 1945). Furthermore, the new estimates includes all the Slovenians from Nazi-occupied Slovenia who were drafted in the Wehrmacht and died either in battle or in prisoner camps during the war. The figure also includes the Slovenes from the Julian March who died in the Italian Army (1940–43), those from Prekmurje who died in the Hungarian Army, and those who fought and died in various Allied (mostly British) units. The figure does not include victims from Venetian Slovenia (except of those who joined the Slovenian Partisan units), nor does it include the victims among Carinthian Slovenes (again with the exception of those fighting in the Partisan units) and Hungarian Slovenes. 47% percent of casualties during the war were partisans, 33% were civilians (of which 82% were killed by Axis powers or Slovene home guard), and 20% were members of the Slovene home guard.\n\nIn Croatia, the Commission for the Identification of War and Post-War Victims of the Second World War was active from 1991 until the Seventh Government of the republic, under Prime Minister Ivica Račan ended the commission in 2002. In the 2000s, concealed mass grave commissions were established in both Slovenia and Serbia to document and excavate mass graves from the Second World War.\n\nAccording to German casualty lists quoted by The Times for 30 July 1945, from documents found amongst the personal effects of General Hermann Reinecke, head of the Public Relations Department of the German High Command, total German casualties in the Balkans amounted to 24,000 killed and 12,000 missing, no figure being mentioned for wounded. A majority of these casualties suffered in the Balkans were inflicted in Yugoslavia. According to German researcher Rüdiger Overmans, German losses in the Balkans were more than three times higher – 103,693 during the course of the war, and some 11,000 who died as Yugoslav prisoners of war.\n\nThe Italians incurred 30,531 casualties during their occupation of Yugoslavia (9,065 killed, 15,160 wounded, 6,306 missing). The ratio of dead/missing men to wounded men was uncommonly high, as Yugoslav partisans would often murder prisoners. Their highest losses were in Bosnia and Herzegovina: 12,394. In Croatia the total was 10,472 and in Montenegro 4,999. Dalmatia was less bellicose: 1,773. The quietest area was Slovenia, where the Italians incurred 893 casualties. An additional 10,090 Italians died post-armistice, either killed during Operation Achse or after joining Yugoslav partisans.\n\n\n"}
