A United States Air Force B-52F-70-BW Stratofortress bomber, AF Serial No. \"57-0166\", c/n 464155, carrying two nuclear weapons departed from Mather Air Force Base near Sacramento. According to the official Air Force report, the aircraft experienced an uncontrolled decompression that required it to descend to in order to lower the cabin altitude. Increased fuel consumption caused by having to fly at lower altitude, combined with the inability to rendezvous with a tanker in time caused the aircraft to run out of fuel. The aircrew ejected safely, and then the unmanned aircraft crashed west of Yuba City, tearing the nuclear weapons from the aircraft on impact. However, in a 2012 book LTC Earl McGill, a retired SAC B-52 pilot, claims that the aircrew, after an inflight refueling session that provided inadequate fuel, refused the offer of an additional, unscheduled inflight refueling, bypassed possible emergency landing fields and ran out of fuel. The crew ejected, the aircraft broke up and four onboard nuclear weapons were released. The weapons' multiple safety interlocks prevented both a nuclear explosion and release of radioactive material. LTC McGill, based on his SAC experience, blames the aircrew failures on the use of dexedrine to combat fatigue on the 24-hour flight preceding the accident.\n\nThe weapons did not detonate as their safety devices worked properly. A fireman was killed and several others injured in a road accident while en route to the accident scene.\n\nThe following timeline is an abridged version of the description transcribed by Oskins and Maggelet from a declassified copy of the original Air Force accident report. Doe 11 was the aircraft call sign. Doe 13 was a second B-52 in formation for the first portion of the flight.\n\nAll times are hours and minutes after takeoff.\n\n0:20 – the pilot first noticed excessive hot air coming from the pilots' vents. All attempts to control this hot air were unsuccessful.\n\n6:00 – Mather Command Post contacted the aircraft on HF radio. The heat problem was discussed and wing guidance received. This consisted of several suggested corrective actions which were verified by the pilot as having been used earlier without success.\n\n6:30 – Mather control room called the aircraft on HF radio and discussed the heat problem and the effects of the heat on the aircraft electronics and crew personnel. Wing guidance at this time was to continue the mission.\n\n6:50 – Mather control room contacted the aircraft and Wing guidance was to \"continue mission as long as you can; call us back after second refueling tonight and advise us of your status, if it gets intolerable, of course, bring it home.\"\n\n11:15 – Mather control called Doe 11 to see if he would complete the mission. At that the response was, \"We are going to try.\"\n\n12:35 – Mather control was contacted by Doe 11 and told that Doe 13's refueling was completed and \"we are about ready to take off.\" Control asked, \"Your present status . . . has it improved?\" The pilot answered \"Negative . . . worse . . . number 3 engine setting at 70% . . . we had it once before and it cleared up but at this time it has not cleared as yet.\" Control advised, \"Understand you will proceed on course and we will be looking for you tomorrow.\"\n\n14:00 – the outside panel of the pilot's L-4 window shattered. The heat in the cockpit was unbearable at this time and had cracked the glass case for the ball on both pilot's and co-pilot's turn and slip indicators. It is estimated that the upper compartment heat level ranged from 125–160 degrees F or higher during this period. A decision was made to depressurize the aircraft and attempt to continue the mission. Altitude was 33,500 feet.\n\n14:20 – after 20 minutes of unpressurized flight, the decision was made to descend to 12,000 feet and continue the mission as far as possible at this altitude.\n\n15:00 – Mather control contacted Doe 11 and asked \"Which windshield is cracked and what is your present altitude?\" Answer received, \"The L-4 window shattered, heat unbearable at altitude, two sick crew members. We have descended to 12,000 feet and plan to go 150 nautical miles north of TP 3.19 and return direct to Mather.\" They were advised to \"proceed as planned, recommend you stay low altitude, give us an estimate on your fuel as soon as you get in close enough to contact us.\"\n\n16:50 – Mather control contacted Doe 11 via HF radio requesting ETA to Mather. The aircraft reported, \"We just passed TP 3.19 at 1212Z, estimate 150 nautical miles north of TP 3.19 at 1239Z, ETA to Mather 1755Z.\"\n\n18:50 – Mather control contacted the aircraft through HF radio to check his progress.\n\n19:45 – McClellan called for flight plan and altitude required from last position to Mather.\n\n20:30 – aircraft contacted McClellan to ask Early Warning vessel \"Hardware\" to look out for them and would like a fix.\n\n21:00 – the aircraft contacted Mather control stating, \"We would like a tanker up here and get a little fuel. We now figure we will be over the field at 14,000 pounds. That is a little light. We would like to have a tanker.\" And, control answered Doe 11 \"will be cleared for a straight in approach and will have tanker standby . . . we will not launch unless you go below 10,000 pounds.\"\n\nDoe 11's ETA to Mather at this time was given as approximately 22:30 hours after takeoff.\n\nFor approximately the next hour, several heading deviations up to 30 degrees were made by the pilot of Doe 11 to circumnavigate the weather associated with a front in this area. Turbulence was moderate. It is estimated from study of weather and Doe 11 pilot and navigator interviews that 7 or 8 minutes were lost during this frontal penetration due to these heading deviations.\n\n21:50 – Mather was contacted through HF radio and advised he had, \"#1 main tank gauge stuck at 10,030 pounds . . . we are not sure just how much fuel we have in it now. We have #2 and one other 1/4 full warning light on and I think it would be a good idea to get that tanker airborne.\" Mather Control Room advised, \"We have a tanker airborne. Pick him up at Red Bluff VOR and refuel back in this direction. You might keep in mind, if things get a little close up there, head into Beale AFB.\" Later in this same conversation, Mather control indicated, \"We will get it off the ground here ASAP.\"\n\n22:10 – Democrat contacted the aircraft on HF advising, \"McClellan is requesting your present position.\" The aircraft advised, \" . . . just coasted in and looking for our tanker.\" This was the last contact through Democrat HF radio.\n\n22:10 – the tanker was launched.\n\n22:23 – the bomber and the tanker initiated the head on rendezvous at 70 nautical miles. Normal mileage countdown was used and the bomber turned the tanker at 21 NM. This left Doe 11 flying at 280K IAS approximately 11NM behind the tanker after the tanker rolled out on refueling track. The bomber asked the tanker to slow down. The tanker reduced speed to 200K IAS, and then to 185K IAS. The bomber maintained 280K IAS to approximately 2NM behind this tanker, and then lost power. The pilot had warned the crew earlier of the possibility of bailout and he now alerted them to prepare for bailout. He initiated a 30 degree bank to the west toward a clear area as all engines flamed out together at approximately 22:40 hours after takeoff.\n\nThe bailout sequence began at approximately 7,000 feet with an outside temperature of approximately 42 degrees, and was normal except the gunner could not jettison his turret despite full strength pull on the inner emergency release handle. The gunner was called forward and bailed out the navigator hatch, using the spare chute in the forward compartment. The pilot continued to guide the aircraft toward a clear area. The crew continued to bail out in order of navigator, spare navigator, spare pilot, EW, gunner, co-pilot and radar navigator. The pilot bailed out at 4,000 feet. The aircraft was trimmed and calculated to be at approximately a 21:1 glide ratio at this time. The aircraft made one complete 360 degree left turn and crashed into a clear flat barley field area 15.75 miles west of Yuba County Airport, California, at approximately 22:50 after takeoff. The aircraft struck the ground at a 15.3 degree left bank and an estimated attitude of 5 degrees nose down at an indicated airspeed of approximately 200 knots. Impact angle was approximately 45 degrees.\n\n"}

{"id": "14785062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14785062", "title": "AberFest", "text": "AberFest\n\nAberFest is a Celtic cultural festival celebrating all things Cornish and Breton that takes place every second year in Cornwall, UK, around Easter. The AberFest Festival alternates with the Breizh – Kernow Festival which is held in Brandivy or Bignan in Brittany, alternating between those two Breton locations.\n\nBoth festivals are unusual in that the main focus of the events is on families and individuals from one country staying with families and individuals from the other, against a wide background of cultural activities.\n\nAn AberFest was last held at Easter 2016. The next AberFest will be 31 March to 2 April 2018.\n\nCornwall and Brittany have Celtic links going back centuries and have closely related Celtic languages and many other traditions that are practised in both countries. Both AberFest and the Breizh – Kernow Festival celebrate these cultures in their traditional and more recent forms.\n\n5th–7th centuries saw a mass emigration of Cornish people to \"Armorica.\" These people were to become the Breton people of modern Brittany. Their language was the Brythonic Celtic language that was to become Breton language (Brezhoneg) in Brittany, the Cornish language (Kernewek) in Cornwall and the Welsh language (Cymraeg) in Wales. Although they are separate languages today they remain closely related.\n\nThroughout the centuries since the first emigrations, there have been continued links and movements of people, up to and including the Second World War, when small numbers of Breton people escaped German-occupied Brittany to live in Cornwall.\n\nWhile the practical working lives of ordinary fishermen were a common sight in ports in both Cornwall and Brittany in the 1960s and later, other links have gone through periods of popularity, including Cornish and Breton wrestling. This saw regular exchange competitions in the inter war years and sporadic interest ever since.\n\nThe late 1970s and 1980s saw a great deal of interest in Inter Celtic organisations and activities. The International Celtic Congress had been very active in the Celtic world through much of the 20th Century, but saw a new enthusiasm in Cornwall as the \"Cornish movement\" looked to other Celtic countries for support and ideas in facing the decline in cultural self-confidence that was very evident at that time. Around the same time the Pan Celtic Festivals had led to the establishment of an independent Inter Celtic festival, \"Lowender Peran\" in Perranporth, Cornwall each October.\n\nAs visitors to this Festival, Katrine Pasco and her husband Patrick Lorho, travelled to Cornwall and made friends with a wide number of people with loose involvement with the Cornish movement including Ron Williams (Ronnie) from Falmouth. After several years of visiting Lowender Peran and strengthening links, Pasco and Lorho, organised the first \"Breizh – Kernow Festival\" in 1987 (Breizh being Breton for Brittany and Kernow being Cornish for Cornwall) in Brandivy, in the Morbihan region of Brittany.\n\nThe Breizh – Kernow Festival was started with the intention of it being at the Breton part of a Festival alternating between Brittany and Cornwall. The Breizh – Kernow festival was then held most years in Brandivy and later included Bignan. This one sided arrangement persisted until 2002.\n\nThe main reason that the festival was not held in Cornwall was that there was a community of like minded people in more or less one geographical location in Brandivy. In Cornwall the links were less involved with a location and more to do with individuals that were spread geographically across Cornwall without a clear location that could be realistically identified as suitable location, nor was there anyone willing to take on the task without such a generally accepted suitable location.\n\nRon Williams had been a very active individual with many voluntary organisations in Falmouth ( a founder of the Falmouth Youth Club,) and throughout Cornwall and was widely known and respected.\n\nFrom 1987 onwards, the friendship between Williams and Pasco, Lorho and their increasing family grew stronger with Williams spending more and more time in his retirement, living with Castel Guen, Brandivy. He also became an increasingly well known and popular figure in Brandivy itself.\n\nRon Williams died on 7 December 2001.\n\nAs a memorial, in particular for Bretons the \"Ronnie Fest\" took place in Falmouth at Easter 2002. Supported by groups such as Cornish dance team \"Ros Keltek\" the day filled the weekend.\n\nThis was a day of celebration of Ron’s life and included organisations and groups with which Ron had worked, in some cases for 40–50 years. Due to the good will towards Ron Williams, in the Falmouth venues, and time were given for free.This included the Easter Sunday afternoon at the Royal Polytechniic Society, and the British Legion Club on the Easter Sunday evening 31 March 2002.\n\nAfter a return to Brittany at Easter 2003, the Festival returned to Cornwall as \"AberFest’04\" and again in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 as AberFest’06, AberFest'08, AberFest'10, AberFest'12 and AberFest'14.\n\nCentral to the aims of both Breizh – Kernow and AberFest Festivals is the arrangement whereby individuals and families are hosted by families from the respective countries. People visiting the festival from one Celtic country stay with families from the host Celtic country.\n\nWhile there are public events that form the \"public\" side of the festivals, it is hosting and being hosted with families that is the core of the success of both the festivals. Through this arrangement, lifelong friendships have developed outside the confines of either festival.\n\nThe personal friendships between individuals and families form a strength and commitment to the relationship between the two festivals. The importance of the personal relationships has not been understood by some who have seen the more public events as of the prime importance and have mistakenly viewed the way to strengthening the festivals, and AberFest in particular, through greater commercialisation of the events.\n\nToday the basic philosophy continues that performers are not paid and perform for free, putting performers on an equal footing and providing a platform for new and in particular younger performers.\n\nA significant contrast between the two festivals is a reflection on the Cultural strengths within both countries. While Breton culture in Brittany is well established, accepted as part of their regional identity and is not under exceptional pressures within the French State, the situation within Cornwall remains different.\n\nThe burgeoning cultural revival within Cornwall now enjoys a greater confidence than in the 1970s or 1980s but it is not universally recognised or accepted, often remaining opaque to those outside the movement.\n\nAlthough AberFest is a relatively new event, it has established a general event Format:-\n\nGood Friday Breton guests arrive at suitable Rendezvous via the Roscoff – Plymouth Ferry, by car and bus, in the late evening. They meet their hosts and travel to their homes. A welcoming event includes music by the groups involved in the festival.\n\nEaster Saturday Free Public performances and processions through Falmouth. A combined dance/concert event featuring Breton Fest Noz and Cornish Ceili, known as the AberFest-Noz takes place in the evening.\n\nEaster Sunday Morning and lunch with host families followed by a public event at a particular location in West/mid Cornwall. ( previous locations have included Godolphin House and St. Michael’s Mount. ) Workshops in various cultural activities ( these were held on the Saturday in previous years)\n\nEaster Monday: known as Rons Day: morning with families. Afternoon group event. Evening, Group party and Miracle.\n\nThe icon used for the festival is that of a Mackerel. This has been embodied in various large \"mascot\" mackerel that have become part of the festival in their own right. Mackerel are fish common to the coasts of both Cornwall and Brittany. The word \"mackerel\" also has certain sexual connotations in both cultures.\n\nAt the end of each Festival a mackerel known as \"Bryl Byghan\" (Cornish for \"small mackerel\") is \"born\" in a ceremony called \"The Miracle.\" Bryl Byghan is about 2 feet (70 cm) long. After the end of the festival, Bryl Byghan is taken back to Brittany and is passed from family to family during the following year. The following Easter,( approximately 12 months after the Miracle) the festival is held in Brittany. At the end of the Breizh-Kernow festival, Bryl Byghan returns to spend most of the next year circulating with families in Cornwall.\n\nAbout 2 weeks before the following AberFest, Bryl Byghan drops out of sight to reappear at the start of AberFest as Bryl (Cornish for \"mackerel\") The \"grown up\" mascot mackerel is about 4 foot (1.5 m) long and becomes the focus of the festival, passing from person to person and it is taken to all events. Bryl is also used as a flag to identify where AberFest host families are during the Festival. In more recent aberfests Byl's appearance has been greeted by the singing of \"you are my mackerel\" to the tune of you are my sunshine.\n\nAs the festival draws to a close, Bryl \"dies\" in a special \"funeral\" (Mort de Bryl) As the festival ends, the \"dead\" Bryl is given to a Breton, selected by previous \"dead\" Bryl receiving Bretons, who are known as \"The Guardians of Bryl.\" The Guardians of Bryl are also responsible for Bryl's well being during the festival.\nThe Bryl \"funeral\" ends with the \"miracle\" of a \"new\" Bryl Byghan being \"born\" to be passed to the Breton families for the next cycle of festivals in Brittany and Cornwall.\n\nBryl Byghan's adventures with families in Brittany and Cornwall have become events in their own right. Bryl Byghan has become a Facebook member with his own Facebook profile and friends. Regular updates and photographs are posted during the year between festivals.\n\nThe success of Bryl and Bryl Byghan has led to the Breizh – Kernow Festival in Brittany adopting a \"Cock\" as their \"mascot.\" So far the Cock's adventures remain in Bryl Byghan's shadow. Rumours of a Bryl / Cock offspring have led to the anticipation of events in 2011 at the next Breizh – Kernow festival in Brittany.\n\nCornish and Breton cultural activities and workshops in previous AberFest festivals have included:-\nDance\nMusic\nSinging, ( individual, group and Choir)\nWrestling ( Breton Gouwren and Cornish Wrestling )\nBombard and Pipes (Bagpipes)\nCooking and \nLanguage ( Brezhoneg and Kernewek)\n\n\n\n"}

However, because both constellations are so close to the Sun when these showers reach their peak, the showers are difficult to view with the naked eye.

From Ascalon the Fatimid vizier, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, launched almost annual attacks into the newly founded Crusader kingdom from 1099 to 1107. It was thrice the case that the two armies met each other at Ramla. \n\nEgyptian armies of the period relied on masses of Sudanese bowmen supported by Arab and Berber cavalry. Since the archers were on foot and the horsemen awaited attack with lance and sword, an Egyptian army provided exactly the sort of immobile target that the Frankish heavy cavalry excelled in attacking. Whereas the Crusaders developed a healthy respect for the harass and surround tactics of the Turkish horse archers, they tended to discount the effectiveness of the Egyptian armies. While overconfidence led to a Crusader disaster at the second battle of Ramla, the more frequent result was a Fatimid defeat. \"The Franks never, until the reign of Saladin, feared the Egyptian as they did the armies from Muslim Syria and Mesopotamia.\"\n\nDespite defeat to the crusaders at the first Battle of Ramla the previous year, al-Afdal was soon ready to strike at the crusaders once again and dispatched around 20,000 troops under the command of his son Sharaf al-Ma'ali. Baldwin I of Jerusalem was in Jaffa when news reached him of the Fatimid invasion force, seeing off survivors of the defeated Crusade of 1101. William of Aquitaine had already departed but many others such as Stephen of Blois and Count Stephen of Burgundy had been forced back due to unfavorable winds and consequently joined Baldwin's force in order to help in the battle. Due to faulty reconnaissance Baldwin severely underestimated the size of the Egyptian army, believing it to be no more than a minor expeditionary force, and rode to face an army of several thousand with only two hundred mounted knights and no infantry. \n\nRealizing his error too late and already cut off from escape, Baldwin and his army were charged by the Egyptian forces and many were quickly slaughtered, although Baldwin and a handful of others managed to barricade themselves in Ramla's single tower. Baldwin was left with no other option than to flee and escaped the tower under the cover of night with just his scribe and a single knight, Hugh of Brulis, who is never mentioned in any source afterwards. Baldwin spent the next two days evading Fatimid search parties until he arrived exhausted, starved and parched in the reasonably safe haven of Arsuf on May 19th. \n\nThe situation of the remaining knights in Ramla deteriorated when Fatimid forces stormed the town on the morning after Baldwin's escape, with only the tower remaining under Crusader control. The Fatimids ruthlessly attacked the tower, undermining walls and setting fires to smoke out the desperate defenders. After a day of desperately holding their ground the remaining knights, all but abandoned by their king, decided to launch a suicidal last stand and charged the besiegers. Almost all of the meagre force was immediately slain including Stephen of Blois, who finally restored the honour that he lost when he deserted the Siege of Antioch four years previously. However, Conrad of Germany, the constable of Henry IV who had previously led a contingent at the Crusade of 1101, fought so valiantly that even after everyone around him was dead he still fought on, holding off the Fatimids to the point that his awestruck foe offered to spare his life if he surrendered.\n\nHaving recuperated in Arsuf, Baldwin commandeered an English pirate ship to break through the Egyptian blockade of Jaffa while a force of eighty knights under Hugh of Falchenburg attempted to break in by land. The victorious Sharaf al-Ma'ali had surrounded the city and, with their king missing and the army presumed destroyed, capitulation seemed inevitable. In order to coax the city into surrender, the Fatimids made the corpse of Gerbod of Scheldewindeke, a knight who had fallen in battle previously, to look like Baldwin I before mutilating the body and parading it in front of the walls of Jaffa. Gerbod had apparently held a resemblance to Baldwin and the crusaders fell for the ruse, with preparations to flee the city underway when Baldwin arrived just in time. Baldwin's arrival disheartened and Sharaf withdrew, allowing Baldwin time to organize a counterattack. With Baldwin's forces strengthened by the arrival of a fleet of French and German Crusaders, he was able to assemble an army of eight thousand men and surprised the unprepared Egyptians. Discontent was already arising from Sharaf's indecisive leadership and the Fatimids quickly routed back to Ascalon. Although Baldwin succeeded in defending his kingdom, his miscalculation had cost the lives of a number of prominent knights which the nascent Kingdom of Jerusalem could ill afford to lose. Further Fatimid incursions continued, with the two nations meeting in battle at Ramla for a third time in 1105.\n\n"}

The event featured 3 stages with 60 bands, including Jackson Browne, Train, The Black Crowes, Zac Brown Band, The Shins, Primus, The Avett Brothers, Joan Jett, Cake, Jane's Addiction, The Flaming Lips, Kings of Leon, The Black Keys, Alabama Shakes, The Iron Heart, Ben Harper and Charlie Musselwhite. Furthur had been scheduled, but withdrew from the lineup due to an injury and health issues suffered by Bob Weir. It was the Napa Valley's first large-scale music festival. 40 local wineries were featured at the festival.\nAlthough the festival attracted over 120,000 attendees and generated mostly positive reviews, several vendors and workers claim to have been left unpaid by organizers following the event. Estimates of well over $2.5 million for unpaid wages and services are being claimed by creditors including the City of Napa, venue provider Napa Valley Expo, a variety of security, catering and transportation companies, a local of International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and individuals. To resolve financial woes, subsequent festival proceeds were used to partially pay off debts.\n\nA 2014 concert, organized by new ownership, took place on May 30-June 1. The lineup of acts included The Cure, OutKast, Weezer, LL Cool J, Heart, Sublime with Rome, Third Eye Blind, De La Soul and Eric Church along with more than 45 additional artists and groups. Promoters for the 2014 event have indicated that they would pay off part of the unpaid debts incurred by the 2013 promoters. The event was held May 30-June 1 2014, at the Napa Valley Expo center.\n\nThe 2015 festival took place on May 29-31 featured headliners Imagine Dragons, Robert Plant, No Doubt, and other popular acts including Public Enemy, Gipsy Kings, Los Lobos, The Avett Brothers, and Snoop Dogg.\nThe 2016 festival which took place on May 27-29th featured headliners Stevie Wonder, Florence + The Machine and Red Hot Chili Peppers along with other popular artists; The Lumineers, Death Cab for Cutie, Lenny Kravitz, Walk the Moon, Rodrigo y Gabriela, Ziggy Marley and Grouplove.\n\nThe 2017 festival, which took place on May 26-28th, featured performers including Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers, Maroon 5, Modest Mouse, Foo Fighters, Live, and The Roots. \n\nThe announced performers for 2018, set to take place from May 25-28, so far include Bruno Mars, The Killers, MUSE, Snoop Dogg, E-40, Head and the Heart, the Chainsmokers, Halsey, Billy Idol, Tank and the Bangas, Thievery Corporation, Phantogram, Mike D, Incubus, Michael Franti & Spearhead, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Dean Lewis \n\nThe 2017 festival took place on May 29-31 featured headliners Maroon 5, Tom Petty, and The Foo Fighters, along with notable acts The Roots, Modest Mouse, Band of Horses, The Roots and Fitz and the Tantrums\n\nBottleRock offers its own app for to view the lineup, build your own personalized schedule and get personalized music recommendations.\n\nSince May 2013, BottleRock Napa Valley Music Festival has drawn rock & roll enthusiasts to California’s premiere wine country. When it first began, it seemed to locals that the idea of a four-day music festival in upscale Napa was completely incompatible, and not the greatest plan. But organizers determined to hold the festival at the park-like area of the Napa Valley Expo situated alongside the river in downtown Napa. The two square miles of riverfront offered a cozy location for concerts, and the organizers clearly advertised which acts played on each day. The idea was to focus on selling more single-day-tickets. Fans wouldn’t have trouble finding places to spend the night.

The response of the media, politicians and the Garda Síochána (Irish police force) led to a sustained controversy referred to by some as Portraitgate.\n\nThe artist, initially unidentified, was eventually revealed to be Conor Casby, a school teacher in his thirties from Claremorris, County Mayo. The first portrait was surreptitiously hung in the National Gallery of Ireland on 7 March 2009. Casby is said to have entered the National Gallery carrying a shoulder bag, and located a free space for his portrait and its caption among other portraits of prominent Irish people such as Michael Collins, W. B. Yeats, and Bono. Casby then left the building unnoticed by security. It was reported as having read: Brian Cowen, Politician 1960–2008. This portrait, acquired uncommissioned by the National Gallery, celebrates one of the finest politicians produced by Ireland since the foundation of the state. Following a spell at the helm of the Department of Finance during a period of unprecedented prosperity, Brian Cowen inherited the office of Taoiseach in 2008. Balancing a public image that ranges from fantastically intelligent analytical thinker to Big Ignorant Fucker from Offaly, the Taoiseach proves to be a challenging subject to represent.\n\nThe National Gallery called gardaí after it discovered the unauthorised painting. It has claimed that it had been hanging in public view for no more than twenty minutes before it was removed, contradicting the \"Sunday Tribune\"'s claim that it hung for over an hour.\n\nThe following day, 8 March, Casby hung a second painting of Cowen in the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA). A woman attempted to buy the RHA portrait before it was removed.\n\nBoth paintings depict Cowen from the waist up, wearing only his glasses. In the RHA painting, he is holding a pair of blue and white underpants in his left hand. In the other, he is clutching a toilet roll.\n\n\"Sunday Tribune\" reporter Ken Foxe was contacted by a source at the National Gallery on 9 March and was the first to break the story of Cowen's portraits. Subsequently, \"Topsy Campbell\" (a pseudonym for Casby) sent camera phone photographs of the paintings on display. The incidents were first reported in the \"Tribune\" of 22 March.\n\nOn 23 March, state broadcaster RTÉ ran a report on the hangings at the end of the \"\". The report by Tadhg Enright displayed the paintings, obtained an appraisal (of zero) from an art expert, and mentioned that Cowen was \"not thought to have posed for the anonymous artist\". The report was not used on subsequent newscasts. On 24 March, the Nine O'Clock News included an apology \"for any personal offence caused to Mr Cowen or his family or for any disrespect shown to the office of Taoiseach by [the prior] broadcast.\" The original item was removed from the online archives at RTÉ.ie, and the apology added.\n\nOn 24 March, \"The Ray D'Arcy Show\" on commercial radio station Today FM, covered the story. Producer Will Hanafin revealed that a friend of the artist had e-mailed photographs of a similarly styled painting to him in January, a caricature of the Taoiseach urinating in a full frontal nude pose. This painting has not been displayed publicly. A Garda detective visited the station requesting the emails. The Garda was said to have been \"sheepish and apologetic\" about the visit but indicated that he had received an order from \"on high\" to initiate an investigation. Hanafin refused to comply with the Garda request and, being told that a search warrant would be sought, labelled the entire affair as \"crazy\".\n\nThe incident was covered by foreign newspapers, including \"The Times\" of London. It was also covered in Canada.\n\nBlogs and social network services such as Twitter were reported to be popular outlets for members of the general public to express their dissatisfaction at the attempted censorship and apology of RTÉ. A YouTube video of the original RTÉ news report had received more than three thousand views within twenty-four hours. The affair was nicknamed \"Picturegate\" and \"Cowengate\" in online discussions.\n\nThe Garda investigation was said to have taken six hours. The possible crimes were offending decency, incitement to hatred, and criminal damage for nailing the painting to the wall (though it has also been reported that paintings were hung without the use of nails) Investigators telephoned Casby and he entered Pearse Street Garda Station where he was interviewed for two hours, admitted to having hung the two paintings and was subsequently released. He gave gardaí five more portraits of other politicians, including Michael McDowell. A file was prepared for the director of public prosecutions, but it is expected that no charges will be brought. Casby expressed his desire to \"draw an end\" to the matter by auctioning the paintings for charity.\n\nThe incidents attracted comment from politicians.\n\nThe RTÉ News report was criticised as being in bad taste by Fianna Fáil Senators Maria Corrigan and Mary O'Rourke and TDs M. J. Nolan and Michael Kennedy. Fine Gael TD Michael W. D'Arcy called it the \"most distasteful report I have seen on RTÉ in years\". Kennedy urged consideration for the feelings of Cowen's wife and children, and called on Director-General of RTÉ Cathal Goan to resign, but did not advocate charging the artist.\n\nSome suggested the government had put pressure on RTÉ to withdraw the report and apologise, or on Today FM to co-operate with the Garda. The station received several complaints that the report was in bad taste, including one from the government press secretary, Eoghan Ó Neachtain, who claimed he was acting on his own initiative. Fine Gael's Enda Kenny and Charles Flanagan called it a restriction on freedom of expression.\n\nLiz McManus of the Labour Party criticised RTÉ for \"bow[ing] to political pressure\". RTÉ claimed the decision to withdraw the report was taken by RTÉ executives, and that Ó Neachtain's complaint was received after the late-night \"News on Two\" had already been broadcast without the report.\n\nSome criticised the Garda investigation as a waste of resources. Fine Gael's Frances FitzGerald said it was \"over the top\"; Rónán Mullen defended it as appropriate. Labour's Joan Burton said \"While I sympathise with the Taoiseach and his family, the public has noticed that it took gardaí six months to go into the Anglo Irish Bank.\"\n\nThe incidents are referred to in the 2009 episode of \"Reeling in the Years\".\n\nIn 2011, it was reported that both paintings were on display in Sean Mac D's pub in Dublin.\n\n\n"}

The festival, which is held to celebrate local agriculture, is headed up by the Circleville Pumpkin Show Corporation. Considered to be the biggest festival in the United States dedicated to the pumpkin, it is billed as The Greatest Free Show On Earth. Attendance has topped 400,000 for the four-day event, which is free to enter.\n\nThe Pumpkin Show begins on the third Wednesday of October and lasts until the following Saturday. In recent years, a Tuesday preview night \"for locals\" has been introduced, adding an unofficial half day to the event.\n\nStarting on the Sunday before the festival, work begins to restrict traffic in downtown Circleville. The restricted areas dedicated to the show are from South Scioto Street on the west to Pickaway Street on the east, and Watt/Pinckney Street on the north to Franklin Street on the south. More than 12 blocks are restricted by this event, which causes massive detours throughout a major portion of the city, including State Route 56 and U.S. Route 22. Because there is no organized parking system, many small businesses, individuals, and non-profit organizations provide parking for varying fees.\n\nIn October 1903, Mayor George R. Haswell decided to hold a small pumpkin-and-corn exhibit in front of his store to celebrate the local harvest. This small exhibit featured corn, carved pumpkins and other harvest-themed displays. Because of the prominence of pumpkins in this first exhibit, the name \"The Pumpkin Show\" was then coined. In the following years local merchants were attracted to improve the size, scope and attendance of the festival. By 1905, the first ride was installed. Soon after, with the success of the shows, an annual festival was organized to be held on the city streets to attract merchants, patrons and improve the quality of the festival.\n\nThe Pumpkin Show has been held annually since 1903. Despite it still being held during the influenza outbreaks of 1918-1919, The Pumpkin Show was silenced for one year during World War I and two years during World War II. Aside from this three-year gap, there have been no other recorded occurrences of the Circleville Pumpkin Show being canceled or postponed.\n\nThe Pumpkin Show became the sixth largest festival in the United States by 2007, attracting more than 300,000 people to the city every year.\n\nEvery Pumpkin Show officially kicks off with the weigh-in of large pumpkins from around the area. The largest pumpkin to date was grown by Bob & Jo Liggett, with their entry from 2014 weighing in at . Recent weigh-ins have had multiple entries that go over .\n\nEvery year, Lindsey's Bakery creates the \"world's largest\" pumpkin pie. Visitors can be in line for over an hour to see the pie. At the 100th anniversary Pumpkin Show in 2006, the bakery had to make a much bigger pie compared to previous years to officially reclaim the title of world's largest. The pie pan was so large that it was moved outside of the bakery window and into a tent out on the street.\n\nAnother long-standing tradition of the Circleville Pumpkin Show is a pageant to crown the Little Miss and Miss Pumpkin Show Queen. The Little Miss Pumpkin Show Queen must be in the 1st grade at a school in Pickaway County, while the Miss Pumpkin Show Queen must be a junior or senior from one of the six local high schools. Once crowned, they lead off each parade for the rest of the event.\n\nSeven parades in total are held during the event (two on Wednesday-Friday, one night parade on Saturday). These parades have many different themes, including the Pet Parade and Baby Parade. These parades also feature performances by many local high school and middle school bands, as well as other organizations. The Ohio University Marching 110, which is often referred to as \"The Most Exciting Band In The Land,\" has made numerous trips to highlight Thursday night's parade of bands. The 2006 Pumpkin Show welcomed The Ohio State University Marching Band. They came back in 2010 to march in the parade of bands again and hold a concert afterwards.\n\nThe Pumpkin Show features several different pumpkin related foods, including pumpkin donuts, pancakes, burgers, ice cream, cookies, fudge, brownies, cream puffs, waffles, pumpkin seeds, and pumpkin pie. Over the course of the event, approximately 23,000 pumpkin pies and more than 100,000 pumpkin donuts are sold from local vendors. There are also many other festival foods available at various stands throughout the event.\n\nDue to its popularity, the Pumpkin Show also has a song, \"The Punkin Show,\" written and composed by M. W. \"Burk\" Burkhart in 1952 (published in 1977).\n\nPeople from over 34 states and 13 different countries have been documented to have attended the festival in the most recent years.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "584987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=584987", "title": "Harmonic Convergence", "text": "Harmonic Convergence\n\nThe Harmonic Convergence is the name given to one of the world's first globally synchronized meditation events, which occurred on August 16–17, 1987. This event also closely coincided with an exceptional alignment of planets in the Solar System.\n\nAlthough the event had been predicted by author Tony Shearer in his book \"Lord of the Dawn\" (1971), the principal organizer of the Harmonic Convergence event was José Argüelles.\n\nAccording to Shearer's interpretation of Aztec cosmology, the selected date marked the end of twenty-two cycles of 52 years each, or 1,144 years in all. The twenty-two cycles were divided into thirteen \"heaven\" cycles, which began in AD 843 and ended in 1519, when the nine \"hell\" cycles began, ending 468 years later in 1987. The very beginning of the nine \"hell\" cycles was precisely the day that Hernán Cortés landed in Mexico, April 22, 1519 (coinciding with \"1 Reed\" on the Aztec/Mayan calendar, the day sacred to Mesoamerican cultural hero Quetzalcoatl). The 9 hell cycles of 52 years each ended precisely on August 16–17, 1987. Shearer introduced the dates and the prophecy to Arguelles in 1970, and he eventually co-opted them and created the name Harmonic Convergence as the public title of the event.\n\nThe timing of the Harmonic Convergence was allegedly significant in the Maya calendar, with some consideration also given to European and Asian astrological traditions. The chosen dates have the distinction of allegedly marking a planetary alignment with the Sun, Moon and six out of eight planets being \"part of the grand trine.\" Though Arguelles eventually connected the timing of the Harmonic Convergence with his understanding of the significance of Maya calendrics, the dates themselves were derived not from Maya cosmology but from Tony Shearer's reconstructed Aztec prophecies.\n\nAccording to the astrologer Neil Michelsen's \"The American Ephemeris,\" on 24 August 1987 there was an exceptional alignment of planets in the Solar System. Eight planets were aligned in an unusual configuration called a grand trine.\n\nThe Sun, Moon and six out of eight planets formed part of the grand trine, that is, they were aligned at the apexes of an equilateral triangle when viewed from the Earth.\n\nThe Sun, Moon, Mars and Venus were in exact alignment, astrologically called a conjunction at the first degree of Virgo in Tropical Astrology. Mercury was in the fourth degree of Virgo which most astrologers count as part of the same conjunction being within the \"orb\" of influence. Jupiter was in Aries, and Saturn and Uranus in Sagittarius completing the grand trine. However some believe that this is an Earth grand trine with Sun/Moon/Mars/Venus/Mercury in the initial degrees of Virgo, Neptune at 5 degrees of Capricorn, and Jupiter in the last degree of Aries (anaretic degree), on the cusp of Taurus. Uranus, and especially Saturn are on the edge of this trine.\n\nControversy is associated to the claim that this occurrence was a unique event. Grand trines, where planets are at 120 degree positions forming an equilateral triangle are not uncommon or particularly noteworthy. Traditional astrology does not consider trines to be action points, so the notion of a special shift in world history would not be in the offing under a grand trine. Hence, many traditional astrologers do not regard this occurrence to be of significant importance. There is no evidence that astronomers have ever considered it significant.\n\nThe convergence is purported to have \"corresponded with a great shift in the earth’s energy from warlike to peaceful.\"\n\nBelievers of this esoteric prophecy maintain that the Harmonic Convergence ushered in a five-year period of Earth's \"cleansing\", where many of the planet's \"false structures of separation\" would collapse.\n\nAccording to Argüelles, the event came at the end of these \"hell\" cycles and the beginning of a new age of universal peace. Adherents believed that signs indicated a \"major energy shift\" was about to occur, a turning point in Earth's collective karma and dharma, and that this energy was powerful enough to change the global perspective of man from one of conflict to one of co-operation. Actress and author Shirley MacLaine called it a \"window of light,\" allowing access to higher realms of awareness.\n\nAccording to Argüelles, the Harmonic Convergence also began the final 25-year countdown to the end of the Mayan Long Count in 2012, which would be the so-called end of history and the beginning of a new 5,125-year cycle. Evils of the modern world, e.g. war, materialism, violence, abuses, injustice, oppression, etc. would end with the birth of the 6th Sun and the 5th Earth on December 21, 2012.\n\nAn important part of the Harmonic Convergence observances was the idea of congregating at \"power centers.\" Power centers were places, such as Mount Shasta, California, Mount Fuji, and Mount Yamnuska where the spiritual energy was held to be particularly strong. The belief was that if 144,000 people assembled at these power centers and meditated for peace, that the arrival of the new era would be facilitated.\n\n\n\n"}

It was discovered in 1977 by the pharmacologists Le Fur and Uzan at Pharmuka, a small French pharmaceutical firm, who credit Baron Shopsin and his colleagues at NYU-Bellevue/NYU School of Medicine in New York with providing the basis for their work. They were particularly influenced by the series of \"synthesis inhibitor studies\" carried out by Shopsin's team during the early to mid 1970s, and in particular, the clinical report by Shopsin et al. (1976) relating to PCPA's rapid reversal of antidepressant response to tranylcypromine in depressed patients. This led to an understanding of the role of the monoamine neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5HT) in the therapeutic effects of the available tricyclic and MAOI class antidepressants. The studies led to widespread recognition of a serotonin hypothesis of depression, contradicting theories that promoted the role of norepinephrine.\n\nWhile citalopram and zimelidine were developed in the early 1970s, it was Pharmuka's indalpine that was first to reach the market. Baron Shopsin was recruited as consultant to Pharmuka throughout a research and development process that resulted in the marketing of indalpine in France and then worldwide, in 1982. With FDA approval of Pharmuka's IND submission to conduct clinical studies with indalpine and viqueline, Shopsin carried out and published the first clinical trials with these drugs in depressed outpatients in the U.S. Astra's SSRI zimelidine was marketed within a year (1983), but the next crop of SSRIs didn't become commercially available until the 1986 marketing of fluvoxamine in Belgium by Duphar, followed by approval in the United States later that year. Lilly's fluoxetine (Prozac) was approved in the US in 1987.\nMeanwhile, zimelidine had been withdrawn soon after its marketing in 1983 due to the emergence of Guillain–Barré syndrome, a serious neurological disease. With lingering concerns among some Common Market countries and activist groups about the potential of SSRIs to induce adverse effects, and the reported association between indalpine and hematological effects, which emerged in the aftermath of Pharmuka's take over by Rhône Poulenc, indalpine was abruptly taken off the market by Rhône Poulenc. Irish psychiatrist David Healy characterized indalpine as being \"born at the wrong time\" during a period when \"indalpine and psychiatry was under siege\" by different interest groups in some of the Common Market countries. In line with indalpine's fate, research and development was halted relating to the 2 other 4-alkyl-piperidine derivatives developed by Pharmuka, viqualine (a serotonin releasing agent) and pipequaline (a GABA receptor positive allosteric modulator), both in different stages of development at the time.\n\nRecently, revision of this molecular motif yielded SERT inhibitors with nanomolar and subnanomolar IC values.\n"}

The rumour of Šmíd's death was spread by Drahomíra Dražská, a porter at a student dormitory in the city's Troja district. The dissident Charter 77 activist Petr Uhl believed her story and passed it along to Radio Free Europe, the BBC and Voice of America, who broadcast it. The news of a student's death shocked many, and the rumour is thought to have contributed to the fall of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Martin Šmíd in question was allegedly a student of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University. Two students with that name attended the school at the time, both in their second year at the university, but nothing happened to either of them on November 17. One did not attend the student demonstration, and the other left it just before the police attack. After the story spread across the country, the public reaction was one of outrage. The government showed the two Martin Šmíds and interviewed one of them on television, but people did not believe their assertion that the story was fictitious. Massive demonstrations began across the weekend and the government responded by arresting Uhl for \"spreading false rumours\".\n\nDrahomíra Dražská's actions, and her motivation for them, have never been fully made clear. The most likely explanation is that she invented the story of Šmíd's death, and Dražská herself has on several occasions reaffirmed this claim. Following the Velvet Revolution, a conspiracy theory began to spread that the incident had been a secret police operation. According to journalist Victor Sebestyen, the StB \"faked the 'death' of Martin Šmíd in order to create a groundswell of popular anger that would remove General Secretary Jakeš and other hardliners, and replace them with Gorbachev-type reformers.\" Sebestyen maintained that Ludvík Zifčák, a junior StB agent who had infiltrated the student movement, fell down and played dead during the November 17 demonstrations in Wenceslas Square and that Dražská, whom Sebestyen also believed to be an StB agent, then passed on to Uhl the story that \"Šmíd\" had been killed.\n\nHowever, an investigation by a committee of the Czechoslovak parliament found no evidence of these claims, and Dražská's involvement with the StB was found highly unlikely. Furthermore, following the events of November 17, Zifčák continued his undercover work, casting doubts on his role as Martin Šmíd since the operation would be compromised had he been recognized.\n"}

The memorial is located at Rayerbazar, Mohammadpur Thana in Dhaka. The memorial was designed by architect Farid U Ahmed and Jami Al Shafi. The initial proposal for a memorial at Rayer Bazar was brought forward by Projonmo 71 (organisation of the children of the martyrs of liberation war), who also laid a temporary foundation stone in 1991.\n\nDuring the entire duration of the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, a large number of teachers, doctors, engineers, poets and writers were systematically massacred by the Pakistan Army and their local collaborators, most notably the alleged Islamist militia groups Al-Badr and Al-Shams. The largest number of assassinations took place on 14 December 1971, only two days before the surrender of the Pakistan Army to the joint forces of the Indian army and Mukti bahini.\nOn the night of 14 December 1971, over 200 of East Pakistan's intellectuals including professors, journalists, doctors, artists, engineers, and writers were rounded up in Dhaka. They were taken blindfolded to torture cells in Mirpur, Mohammadpur, Nakhalpara, Rajarbagh and other locations in different sections of the city. They were later executed en masse, most notably at Rayerbazar and Mirpur.

In one such incident, filmmaker Zahir Raihan was killed on 30 January 1972 in Mirpur, allegedly by the armed Beharis of Mirpur.\n\nThe number of intellectuals killed is estimated as: educationist 991, journalist 13, doctor 49, lawyer 42, others (litterateur, artist and engineer) 16.\n\nIntellectuals who were killed between 25 March and 16 December 1971 in different parts of the country included Govinda Chandra Dev (Philosopher, Professor at DU), Munier Chowdhury (Litterateur, dramatist, Professor at DU), Mufazzal Haider Chaudhury (Litterateur, Professor at DU), Anwar Pasha (Litterateur, Professor at DU), Mohammed Fazle Rabbee (cardiologist), Alim Chowdhury (ophthalmologist), Shahidullah Kaisar (journalist), Nizamuddin Ahmed (Reporter), Selina Parvin (reporter), Altaf Mahmud (lyricist and musician), Hobibur Rahman (Professor of Mathematics, RU), Sukhranjan Somaddar (Professor of Sanskrit, RU), Mir Abdul Quaiyum (Professor of Psychology, RU), Dhirendranath Datta (politician), Ranadaprasad Saha (philanthropist), Lt. Col. Moazzem Hossain (ex-soldier), Mamun Mahmood (Police Officer), and many others.\n\nIn 1993, the Government of Bangladesh decided to erect a memorial at the site. The Ministry of Housing and Works Department and the Institute of Architects Bangladesh jointly organised a national level architectural competition for the design of the memorial \"Badhya Bhumi Smriti Soudha\". Out of 22 entries the jurors selected the design proposal of Architect Farid Uddin Ahmed and Architect Md Jami-al-Shafi. Public Works Department was responsible for the implementation of the project and its completion took about three years (1996 to 1999).\n\nThe main element of the monument is approxiamtley 17.7 m high, 0.9 m thick and 115.8 m long curved brick wall, representing the original brickfield of Rayer Bazar where the dead bodies were found. The wall is broken at the two ends, representing grief and sorrow. A square window at the south-west side of the wall permits visitor's view to reach the sky behind, that also scale down the wall. In front of the curved wall is a still water body from which rises a black granite column, which represents grief.\n\n"}

The event draws crowds from all over Michigan and its surrounding states with attendance usually topping 100,000 over the three-day weekend. The festival is hosted by the Howell Area Chamber of Commerce, and Balloonfest Director Michelle Tokan.\n\nThe festival starts each year on Friday afternoon with the opening of the carnival. Being right on Grand River, the lights make a spectacle for anyone driving through the downtown area every night. Friday night also features a fireworks display, as of the 2009 festival, sponsored by MediLodge of Howell. The Arts Festival held next to the Howell High School main campus goes on for the entire weekend as long as the Balloonfest is running and attracts vendors selling anything from crafts to hand-painted artwork. Saturday morning the day starts early with the balloon fly-in. In downtown Howell, the Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital kids day, held on the lawn of the historical Howell Courthouse, features demonstrations such as karate and dancing. One of the favorite events of the festival is held late on Saturday night each year, the balloon night glow. After the evening launch, the pilots all come back to the launch field and re-inflate their balloons, then led by a countdown, they all light their torches together and the crowd is treated to all the balloons glowing together on the field.\n\nThere are several mass balloon launches scheduled each year. Many years there are some canceled due to inclement weather such as rain or heavy wind. On Friday night the balloons all launch from the Howell High School Freshman Campus main launch field. On Saturday morning, the pilots have to fly back in to the same field and try to drop a marker onto a large target that has been placed where they would normally take off. That evening holds another mass launch followed by the Balloon Glow. Sunday morning holds an early mass launch which many Howell natives enjoy waking up to.\n\nThe sponsor list changes up every year. The main sponsor for 2010 was PNC Bank. Other sponsors include Waste Management, Inc, who provide all sanitation services for the weekend, MediLodge of Howell who sponsors the fireworks and hosts the VIP party for pilots and sponsors, PepsiCo as the beverage sponsor, and Howell Public Schools, Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, and Citizens Insurance are also major contributors.\n\n"}

Rallies can be large or small, and one-time or recurring. Some rallies are ride-in events, whereas some like the Iron Butt Rally involve days of riding and an actual gathering only at the end of the ride.\n\nNotable annual North American rallies with attendance in the hundreds of thousands from all over the continent include the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, Laconia Motorcycle Week, Black Bike Week and Daytona Beach Bike Week. The Republic of Texas Biker Rally is held each June in Austin, Texas and attracts over 200,000 bikers to the state capitol. There are innumerable smaller, regional rallies around the United States, including the annual BMW MOA international rally, the Oyster Run in the Pacific Northwest, the Golden Aspen Rally (formerly Aspencade) in the Southwest, the Laughlin River Run in the West, Americade in the Northeast, and Motorcycles on Meridian in the Midwest. A popular rally in the East takes place in the mountains of Maryland, Apple's East Coast Motorcycle Rally (formerly East Coast Sturgis) is best known for its \"old school\" feel, beautiful mountain riding and even a Motorcycle Demolition Derby.\n\nRallies will often incorporate entertainment such as a burnout pit, motorcycle contests, bike washes, motorcycle stunt performances like wheelie acts and the wall of death, live bands, and dice runs or poker runs. The Indianapolis and Daytona Beach motorcycle rallies have championship motorcycle racing at nearby circuits. In some cases, rallies are held as benefits for organizations or groups such as the American Red Cross, American Cancer Society, American Legion or VFW.\n\nThe longest established motorcycle rally in Europe is the \"Elefantentreffen\" (Elephant Rally), established in 1956 by former Wehrmacht motorcyclists and named in honour of the Zündapp motorcycle that was nicknamed the \"green elephant.\" The growing reputation of the Elephant Rally led to the creation in 1962 of a British winter rally, the Dragon rally, held each February in North Wales.\n\nOne of the largest motorcycle rallies in Europe is the Thundersprint, held annually in May in Northwich, Cheshire, England and usually has notable motorcycle champions or enthusiasts such as Giacomo Agostini and James May. Another large motorcycle rally is Glemseck 101. It takes place around the Glemseck at the Solitude race track in Leonberg, Germany every first weekend in September. A special attraction are the 1/8 mile drag races, where customizers and motorcycle brands send their best bikes and bikers to the race (e.g. Triumph, BMW, Yamaha, Suzuki).\n\nIn the UK, the Iron Ore Rally is held annually in Egremont Cumbria and the Rally of Discovery is held in Ireland. Rallies are held all year round. Many motorcyclists (or bikers) prefer the winter rallies, such as the Mayflower MCCs Force Ten Rally or the Dean Vally MCCs Rallymans Rally. The usual order of the day is camping with a real ale tent and music. Rallies usually start on a Friday afternoon and finish at lunchtime on a Sunday. The point is to travel there by motorcycle, motorcycle and sidecar or trike (not cars or vans), meet friends from all over the country and sometimes further afield, claim a rally badge and enjoy the entertainment. Prizes are awarded for the furthest distance travelled, best bike, best rat bike, oldest person attending, youngest person attending, etc. There are usually planned ride-outs on the Saturday taking in good roads and sometimes historic sites, museums, etc.\n\nIn the UK many people relate motorcycle rallies to the famous Bulldog Bash near Stratford-upon-Avon. This is a hugely popular event and attracts thousands of people including non-motorcyclists. There are many much smaller rallies that attract between 50 and 500 bikers to each event, organised and controlled by a host club. Rallies are still attended by motorcyclists that have been going to rallies for up to 40 or 50 years. In the UK motorcycle rallies began in earnest in the early 1960s as young, mainly working class men and women (usually on the pillion) gained freedom by motorcycle ownership and set off around the country camping. Some went in groups or clubs and thus the rally was born. Many were Ton-up boys, later Greasers and then Greebos.\n\nGypsy tour is an American motorcycling term which originated before the 1920s; the term has been mostly but not entirely replaced by \"rally\" or \"run\". Gypsy tours were organized where groups of riders all over the country converged on a favorite destination. The term \"gypsy\" was used because the riders would travel long distances and often sleeping in tents around a campfire along the way much like the Hollywood stereotype gypsies.\n\nOne Australian newspaper referring to a Gypsy Tour rally from Melbourne to Sydney in 1927, stated - \"The idea of a \"gypsy tour\" originated in America. There these tours are usually being organised simultaneously in different cities and towns, and routes all converging on one centre, where a great rally is held by the touring parties\".\nThe term gypsy tour has been used for other activities, but predominantly motorcycle rallies, and the idea quickly spread around the world.\n\nMany gypsy tours have been held over the years and are still a regular event for many vintage and modern motorcycle groups.\nThe annual gypsy tour to Laconia, New Hampshire near Lake Winnipesaukee began in 1916 and is the oldest continuous motorcycle event in the U.S.\n\nA number of rallies are held throughout Australia, at all times of the year. These range from 'back to basics' rallies, usually held in remote locations with no facilities, to catered rallies held in country towns and other rural locations. Many rallies are held at a local recreation reserve, football ground, racecourse or showground in country towns. These venues often have toilet/shower blocks, and bar/kitchen facilities. Often the motorcycle club organising the rally will arrange for a local service group like the Rotary club, or local sporting club to cater an evening meal and breakfast, and to run the bar. These events often provide much needed revenue sources for the communities in which the rallies are held, and the communities welcome the rallies to their towns.\n\nCompared to European and American rallies, Australian rallies are often small affairs, with attendance ranging from a few dozen to a few hundred bikes.\n\nThe Ulysses Club Annual General Meeting Event is a weeklong affair that brings in thousands of motorcyclists and millions of dollars to its host site, which can be different each year. The 2014 event in Alice Springs is expected to draw 5,000 to 7,000 participants.\n\nThere are number of rallies held throughout New Zealand, most events taking place over the warmer months. There are a couple of cold weather rallies such as the Brass Monkey Motorcycle Rally.\n\n"}

National Science Week welcomes an audience of over a million and hosts more than 1000 events across the nation. Science Week provides an opportunity for all Australians to participate in events and activities that showcase science and encourages younger people to consider continuing studies in science. Past participants have included polar explorer and environmental scientist Tim Jarvis, NASA Astronaut Katherine Megan McArthur; environmentalist Tanya Ha; theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss; and palaeontologist Scott Sampson. Another key activity during National Science Week is the National Project, which is run in conjunction with ABC Australia. Past project have included Weather Detective in 2014 and the Aussie Star Hunt in 2009. Also in 2009 Cosmos Magazine launched a website called HELLO FROM EARTH which collected over 28,000 messages which were beamed to the first Earth like planet candidate, Gliese 581d. In 2016 it included Wikibomb2016, a project to create missing Wikipedia pages on Australian women scientists.\n\nIn India, Science Week culminates in National Science Day, which takes place each year on 28 February to commemorate C. V. Raman's discovery of the Raman Effect.\n\nBritain's National Science Week was first held in 1994. It is now known as \"British Science Week\" and is one of the largest national celebrations of science. It is organised by the British Science Association and funded by BEIS (UK Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills) and other partners. British Science Week is a massive UK-wide grassroots celebration of science which saw over 1 million people taking part in over 2,300 events and activities throughout the UK in 2017. \n\nIn the United States, the National Science & Technology Week was one of the National Science Foundation's main outreach efforts between 1985 and 1999, before the program was succeeded by \"Find Out Why\", a year-long outreach effort focused on families, offering everyday science activities. The idea was revisited in 2005 by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, in collaboration with other government and scientific partners, with an \"Excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (ESTEME) Week.\" \n\nOther national science weeks include the Norwegian Forskningsdagene (\"Research Days\"), the Science Week in Catalonia, Canada's National Science & Technology Week, Science Week in Ireland, the South African National Science Week, and China's National Science Week launched in May 2006.

The organisation currently has a presence in over 20 cities throughout 5 continents, and had 2000 participants in 2017 .\nRandom Hacks of Kindness grew out of an industry panel discussion at the first Crisis camp Bar Camp in Washington, DC in June 2009. Panel attendees included Patrick Svenburg of Microsoft, Phil Dixon and Jeff Martin of Google and Jeremy Johnstone of Yahoo. They agreed to use their developer communities to create solutions that will affect disaster response, risk reduction and recovery. The idea was for a \"hackathon\" with developers producing open source solutions. The World Bank's Disaster Risk Reduction Unit (Stuart Gill) and NASA's Open Government team (Robbie Schingler) joined the partnership and these \"founding partners\" (Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, NASA and the World Bank) decided on the name \"Random Hacks of Kindness\" for their first event.\n\nAn innovation incubator in the area of sustainable development, SecondMuse acts as \"operational lead\" for Random Hacks of Kindness, coordinating global volunteer efforts, facilitating collaborative partnerships, and managing communications and branding.\n\nThe first Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK 0) was held at the Hacker Dojo in Mountain View, California in November 2009. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate gave the keynote and made a call to action to the developers to apply their creativity to the challenges and featured hacks. The first RHoK event is known as RHoK 0 after 0-based array indexing in computer programming.\n\nFeatured projects were\n\nTweak the Tweet was used during the Haiti earthquake response in January 2010\n\nThe second RHoK event was held at the Microsoft Chevy Chase offices in Washington DC on June 4–6, 2010.

The most active city to be participant was Buenos Aires, which was held in the Globant office and the participants included Guibert Englebienne (CTO of Globant) and Alejandro Pablo Tkachuk (ex-Globant and now CTO of Calculistik) .\n\nRHoK 3.0 was held twice in 2012: On the 3-4 June and again on the 1-2 December. This saw multiple cities come into play and a huge turnaround of developers from all over the world including Cape Town. The focus of the hackathon was toilets and/or sanitation.\n\nThe sixth global hackathon (RHoK 4.0) was also a major success. It was held twice in 2013 (in June and in December).

However, a new website was created at the end of 2016 at rhok.cc, and communities continued to thrive in multiple cities in India and Australia, as well as Ottawa and Berlin . RHoK Jnr, an independent effort for students in the United States, also continued to thrive, holding 7 events in 2016.\n\nIn 2017 rebuilding of the global community continued, and connections with all the active RHoK communities around the world were reestablished. The global community grow considerably, with events over 6 cities in Australia and 3 in India, as well as events in Ottawa, Berlin, Washington DC, Pretoria, and Ghana.\n\nThe Random Hacks of Kindness specifies that all contributions and code produced during RHoK hackathons must be released under an OSI approved open source license and be released in a public code repository.

The detonation occurred in the Northern Russian \"closed\" town of Severomorsk (), over 900 miles (1,448.4 kilometers) from the Russian capital Moscow.\n\nMunitions had reportedly detonated after a fire started on May 13, which thus caused a massive chain of explosions on May 17, and resulted in the deaths of at least 200–300 people, and the destruction of at least 900 of the Northern Fleet's missiles and torpedoes.\n\nMost of the dead were allegedly ordnance technicians \"sent into the fire in a desperate but unsuccessful effort to defuse or disassemble munitions before they exploded\", according to the \"New York Times\".\n\nThe town of Severomorsk has long had history with the armed forces of both the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, a history that dates to before the Second World War. \n\nIt is a history in part signified by the presence of at least two Russian military airbases within 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) of the town, as well as a naval base and its munitions depot (the Okolnaya naval munitions depot), as well as serving as the main administrative base of the Russian Navy's Northern Fleet.\n\nAt the time of the disaster, the Northern Fleet was believed to have an aircraft carrier, 148 cruisers, destroyers and other warships, and 190 of the navy's 371 submarines, of which two were apparently stationed at the munitions depot.\n\nOn May 13, 1984, a fire started in the Okolnaya munitions depot on the outskirts of Severomorsk, the cause of which allegedly was the fact that munitions had been stored too close together.\n\nOn May 17, the fire caused the detonation of the munitions at the depot. For about an hour and a half, sporadic blasts occurred at the supply depot, that resulted in the deaths of between 200–300 people, most of whom were ordnance technicians that had been \"sent into the fire in a desperate but unsuccessful effort to defuse or disassemble munitions before they exploded\", according to the \"New York Times\".\n\nDozens of local civilians began to evacuate their apartments and head to the hills, as the blast was allegedly so powerful that it was first thought a nuclear accident had occurred.\n\nThe blast and the evacuation were described on a Russian navy blog over twenty years later;\n\n\"\"Women ran into the streets with children in their arms, many only half dressed in house coats and slippers, the men running henny-penny with them, certain of them in uniform, giving the scene a weird drama. People ran up the stairs that lead up the slopes of the hills. Someone fell, he was picked up and dragged. Cars jammed the routes out of town. The cars were packed, but despite this they stopped to pick up children which their mothers literally threw into the arms of strangers. Screams, cries, curses – all drowned out by the thunder and howl from the volcano that was Mount Okol'naya \"[The apparent namesake of the Okolnaya Naval Munitions depot, where the incident had begun days earlier]. \"Black with an orange-purple mushroom top, growing to its full height in an instant, nodding toward the town, but afterwards it began to slowly settle in the direction of the tundra and the ocean.\"\"\n\nOne of the first mentions of the incident in the media was, reportedly, an article published on July 10 of the same year by the newly established British non-fiction military weekly magazine, Jane's Defence Weekly (JDW), which claimed that it had obtained the information from \"Western intelligence sources.\"\n\nThough no nuclear weapons were damaged during the fire and subsequent explosion, according to the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, had nuclear weapons detonated during the blasts, the nuclear fallout would've almost certainly reached Norway, just away.\n\n"}

{"id": "58072370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58072370", "title": "Team AngelicvM", "text": "Team AngelicvM\n\nTeam AngelicvM is a private company based in Chile that plans to deploy a small rover on the Moon in 2020. Their rover, called Unity, is one of various rovers that will be carried by the commercial \"Peregrine\" lander manufactured by Astrobotic Technology.\n\nTeam AngelicvM was created in 2010 in Santiago, Chile, with the purpose to compete for the Google Lunar X Prize. This international competition offered US$20 million for the first privately-developed rover to land on the Moon, travel at least 500 meters, and transmit high-definition video and images back to Earth. Since no team was able to make a launch attempt to reach the Moon by the 31 March 2018 deadline, the Google Lunar XPRIZE went unclaimed and the competition ended without a winner, but AngelicvM plans to go ahead with the rover's development and launch.\n\nTeam AngelicvM is financed by AngelicvM Foundation (\"Inversiones AngelicvM\"); its owner and President is Gerardo Rocha-Haardt, who by 2012 has financed about $3 million USD. Rocha-Haardt explained that since there is no space agency in Chile, he hopes to inspire and stimulate the private sector's participation in the outer space economy. Rocha-Haardt invited all Chilean universities to participate in the project. They were joined by the Universidad de Concepción and Universidad Austral de Chile, that are developing the rover.\n\nAngelicvM signed a contract with Astrobotic Technology in 2015 to have their rover carried on board Astrobotic's \"Peregrine\" lander, and in July 2017, Astrobotic announced an agreement had been reached with United Launch Alliance for the launch. As of May 2018, Astrobotic's first \"Peregrine\" lander mission is reported to have 12 customers, and is planned to be launched in 2020 on an Atlas V rocket. The selected landing site is Lacus Mortis. The lander's commercial payload include Team Hakuto's rover, and a set of mini-rovers from the Mexican Space Agency.\n\nThe first rover's concept was called \"Dandelion\". Its body was spherical of about 10 cm in diameter with a flat top and bottom. It uses two bilateral \"legged\" wheels for traction and it keeps upright by a pendulum. This light traction concept was inspired on insect legs, and it was considered because that is what all insects evolved for efficient displacement on uneven surfaces. Adding some flexibility to each blade/leg, it imitates the tendon in the insect leg and holds potential energy for better traction. Preliminary tests performed in Chile's Atacama desert were reported to surpass their predicted expectations.\n\nAngelicvM's current rover concept is a 5 kg, four-wheeled rover called \"Unity\".\n\nThe team has 34 members, all professionals and mostly volunteers. Their transmission to Earth will be a high-definition music video that carries \"a message of faith, hope, peace and unity to the World.\n\n"}

{"id": "31292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31292", "title": "Treason", "text": "Treason\n\nIn law, treason is the crime that covers some of the more extreme acts against one's nation or sovereign. Historically, treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors, such as the murder of a husband by his wife or that of a master by his servant. Treason against the king was known as high treason and treason against a lesser superior was petty treason. A person who commits treason is known in law as a traitor.\n\nAt times, the term \"traitor\" has been used as a political epithet, regardless of any verifiable treasonable action. In a civil war or insurrection, the winners may deem the losers to be traitors. Likewise the term \"traitor\" is used in heated political discussiontypically as a slur against political dissidents, or against officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents. In certain cases, as with the \"Dolchstoßlegende\" (Stab-in-the-back myth), the accusation of treason towards a large group of people can be a unifying political message. Treason is considered to be different and on many occasions a separate charge from \"treasonable felony\" in many parts of the world.\n\nIn English law, high treason was punishable by being hanged, drawn and quartered (men) or burnt at the stake (women), although beheading could be substituted by royal command (usually for royalty and nobility). Those penalties were abolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively. The penalty was used by later monarchs against people who could reasonably be called traitors, although most modern jurists would call it excessive. Many of them would now just be considered dissidents.\n\nIn William Shakespeare's play \"King Lear\" (c. 1600), when the King learns that his daughter Regan has publicly dishonoured him, he says \"They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder\": a conventional attitude at that time. In Dante Alighieri's \"Inferno\", the ninth and lowest circle of Hell is reserved for traitors; Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus, suffers the worst torments of all: being constantly gnawed at by one of Lucifer's own three mouths. His treachery is considered so notorious that his name has long been synonymous with \"traitor\", a fate he shares with Benedict Arnold, Vidkun Quisling, Marcus Junius Brutus (who too is depicted in Dante's \"Inferno\", suffering the same fate as Judas along with Cassius Longinus). Indeed, the etymology of the word \"traitor\" originates with Judas' handing over of Jesus to the chief priests, captains of the temple and elders (Luke 22:52): the word is derived from the Latin \"traditor\" which means \"one who delivers.\"\nChristian theology and political thinking until after the Enlightenment considered treason and blasphemy as synonymous, as it challenged both the state and the will of God. Kings were considered chosen by God, and to betray one's country was to do the work of Satan.\n\nMany nations' laws mention various types of treason. \"Crimes Related to Insurrection\" is the internal treason, and may include a coup d'etat. \"Crimes Related to Foreign Aggression\" is the treason of cooperating with foreign aggression positively regardless of the national inside and outside. \"Crimes Related to inducement of Foreign Aggression\" is the crime of communicating with aliens secretly to cause foreign aggression or menace. Depending on a country, conspiracy is added to these.\n\nIn Australia, there are federal and state laws against treason, specifically in the states of New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. Similarly to Treason laws in the United States, citizens of Australia owe allegiance to their sovereign, the federal and state level. \n\nThe federal law defining treason in Australia is provided under section 80.1 of the Criminal Code, contained in the schedule of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. It defines treason as follows:\n\nA person is not guilty of treason under paragraphs (e), (f) or (h) if their assistance or intended assistance is purely humanitarian in nature.\n\nThe only permissible penalty for treason is life imprisonment. Section 24AA of the Crimes Act 1914 creates the related offence of treachery.\n\nThe Treason Act 1351, the Treason Act 1795 and the Treason Act 1817 form part of the law of New South Wales. The Treason Act 1795 and the Treason Act 1817 have been repealed by Section 11 of the Crimes Act 1900, except in so far as they relate to the compassing, imagining, inventing, devising, or intending death or destruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim, or wounding, imprisonment, or restraint of the person of the heirs and successors of King George III of the United Kingdom, and the expressing, uttering, or declaring of such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them.\n\nSection 12 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) creates an offence which is derived from section 3 of the Treason Felony Act 1848:\n\nSection 16 provides that nothing in Part 2 repeals or affects anything enacted by the Treason Act 1351 (25 Edw.3 c. 2). This section reproduces section 6 of the Treason Felony Act 1848.\n\nThe offence of treason was created by section 9A(1) of the Crimes Act 1958.\n\nIn South Australia, treason is defined under Section 7 of the South Australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 and punished under Section 10A. Any person convicted of treason against South Australia will receive a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nAccording to Brazilian law, treason is the crime of disloyalty by a citizen to the Federal Republic of Brazil, applying to combatants of the Brazilian military forces. Treason during wartime is the only crime for which a person can be sentenced to death \"(see capital punishment in Brazil)\".\n\nThe only military person in the history of Brazil to be convicted of treason was Carlos Lamarca, an army captain who deserted to become the leader of a communist-terrorist guerrilla against the military government.\n\nSection 46 of the Criminal Code has two degrees of treason, called \"high treason\" and \"treason.\" However, both of these belong to the historical category of high treason, as opposed to petty treason which does not exist in Canadian law. Section 46 reads as follows:\n\nHigh treason\n(1) Every one commits high treason who, in Canada,\nTreason\nIt is also illegal for a Canadian citizen or a person who owes allegiance to Her Majesty in right of Canada to do any of the above outside Canada.\n\nThe penalty for high treason is life imprisonment. The penalty for treason is imprisonment up to a maximum of life, or up to 14 years for conduct under subsection (2)(b) or (e) in peacetime.\n\nFinnish law distinguishes between two types of treasonable offences: \"maanpetos\", treachery in war, and \"valtiopetos\", an attack against the constitutional order. The terms \"maanpetos\" and \"valtiopetos\" are unofficially translated as treason and high treason, respectively. Both are punishable by imprisonment, and if aggravated, by life imprisonment.\n\n\"Maanpetos\" consists in joining enemy armed forces, making war against Finland, or serving or collaborating with the enemy. \"Maanpetos\" proper can only be committed under conditions of war or the threat of war. Espionage, disclosure of a national secret, and certain other related offences are separately defined under the same rubric in the Finnish criminal code.\n\n\"Valtiopetos\" consists in using violence or the threat of violence, or unconstitutional means, to bring about the overthrow of the Finnish constitution or to overthrow the president, cabinet or parliament or to prevent them from performing their functions.\n\nArticle 411-1 of the French Penal Code defines treason as follows:\nThe acts defined by articles 411-2 to 411-11 constitute treason where they are committed by a French national or a soldier in the service of France, and constitute espionage where they are committed by any other person.\n\nArticle 411-2 prohibits \"handing over troops belonging to the French armed forces, or all or part of the national territory, to a foreign power, to a foreign organisation or to an organisation under foreign control, or to their agents\". It is punishable by life imprisonment and a fine of €750,000. Generally parole is not available until 18 years of a life sentence have elapsed.\n\nArticles 411-3 to 411-10 define various other crimes of collaboration with the enemy, sabotage, and the like. These are punishable with imprisonment for between seven and 30 years. Article 411-11 make it a crime to incite any of the above crimes.\n\nBesides treason and espionage, there are many other crimes dealing with national security, insurrection, terrorism and so on. These are all to be found in Book IV of the code.\n\nSection 2 of the Crime Ordinance provides that levying war against the HKSAR Government of the People's Republic of China, conspiring to do so, instigating a foreigner to invade Hong Kong, or assisting any public enemy at war with the HKSAR Government, is treason, punishable with life imprisonment.\n\nGerman law differentiates between two types of treason: \"High treason\" (\"Hochverrat\") and \"treason\" (\"Landesverrat\"). High treason, as defined in Section 81 of the German criminal code is defined as a violent attempt against the existence or the constitutional order of the Federal Republic of Germany, carrying a penalty of life imprisonment or a fixed term of at least ten years. In less serious cases, the penalty is 1–10 years in prison. German criminal law also criminalises high treason against a German state. Preparation of either types of the crime is criminal and carries a penalty of up to five years.\n\nThe other type of treason, \"Landesverrat\" is defined in Section 94. It is roughly equivalent to espionage; more precisely, it consists in betraying a secret either directly to a foreign power, or to anyone not allowed to know of it; in the latter case, treason is only committed if the aim of the crime was explicitly to damage the Federal Republic or to favor a foreign power. The crime carries a penalty of one to fifteen years in prison. However, in especially severe cases, life imprisonment or any term of at least of five years may be sentenced.\n\nAs for many crimes with substantial threats of punishment active repentance is to be considered in mitigation under §83a StGB (Section 83a, Criminal Code).\n\nNotable cases involving \"Landesverrat\" are the Weltbühne trial during the Weimar Republic and the Spiegel scandal of 1962. On 30. July 2015, Germany's Public Prosecutor General Harald Range initiated criminal investigation proceedings against the German blog netzpolitik.org.\n\nArticle 39 of the Constitution of Ireland (adopted in 1937) states:\n\ntreason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by the Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.\n\nFollowing the enactment of the 1937 constitution, the Treason Act 1939 provided for the imposition of the death penalty for treason. The Criminal Justice Act 1990 abolished the death penalty, setting the punishment for treason at life imprisonment, with parole in not less than forty years. No person has been charged under the Treason Act. Irish republican legitimatists who refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the Republic of Ireland have been charged with lesser crimes under the Offences against the State Acts 1939–1998.\n\nThe Italian law defines various types of crimes that could be generally described as treason (\"tradimento\"), although they are so many and so precisely defined that no one of them is simply called \"tradimento\" in the text of \"Codice Penale\" (Italian Criminal Code). The treason-type crimes are grouped as \"crimes against the personhood of the State\" (\"Crimini contro la personalità dello Stato\") in the Second Book, First Title, of the Criminal Code.\n\nArticles 241 to 274 detail crimes against the \"international personhood of the State\" such as \"attempt against wholeness, independence and unity of the State\" (art.241), \"hostilities against a foreign State bringing the Italian State in danger of war\" (art.244), \"bribery of a citizen by a foreigner against the national interests\" (art.246), and \"political or military espionage\" (art.257).\n\nArticles 276 to 292 detail crimes against the \"domestic personhood of the State\", ranging from \"attempt on the President of the Republic\" (art.271), \"attempt with purposes of terrorism or of subversion\" (art.280), \"attempt against the Constitution\" (art.283), \"armed insurrection against the power of the State\" (art.284), and \"civil war\" (art.286).\n\nFurther articles detail other crimes, especially those of conspiracy, such as \"political conspiracy through association\" (art.305), or \"armed association: creating and participating\" (art.306).\n\nThe penalties for treason-type crimes, before 1948, included death as maximum penalty, and, for some crimes, as the only penalty possible. Nowadays the maximum penalty is life imprisonment (\"ergastolo\").\n\nJapan does not technically have a law of treason. Instead it has an offence against taking part in foreign aggression against the Japanese state (\"gaikan zai\"; literally \"crime of foreign mischief\"). The law applies equally to Japanese and non-Japanese people, while treason in other countries usually applies only to their own citizens. Technically there are two laws, one for the crime of inviting foreign mischief (Japan Criminal Code section 2 clause 81) and the other for supporting foreign mischief once a foreign force has invaded Japan. \"Mischief\" can be anything from invasion to espionage. Before World War II, Japan had a crime similar to the English crime of high treason (\"Taigyaku zai\"), which applied to anyone who harmed the Japanese emperor or imperial family. This law was abolished by the American Occupation force after World War II.\n\nThe application of \"Crimes Related to Insurrection\" to the Aum Shinrikyo cult of religious terrorists was considered.\n\nNew Zealand has treason laws that are stipulated under the Crimes Act 1961. Section 73 of the Crimes Act reads as follows:\n\nEvery one owing allegiance to Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand commits treason who, within or outside New Zealand,—\nThe penalty is life imprisonment, except for conspiracy, for which the maximum sentence is 14 years' imprisonment. Treason was the last capital crime in New Zealand law, with the death penalty not being revoked until 1989, years after it was abolished for murder.\n\nVery few people have been prosecuted for the act of treason in New Zealand and none have been prosecuted in recent years.\n\nArticle 85 of the Constitution of Norway states that \"[a]ny person who obeys an order the purpose of which is to disturb the liberty and security of the Storting <nowiki>[Parliament]</nowiki> is thereby guilty of treason against the country.\"\n\nArticle 275 of the Criminal Code of Russia defines treason as \"espionage, disclosure of state secrets, or any other assistance rendered to a foreign State, a foreign organization, or their representatives in hostile activities to the detriment of the external security of the Russian Federation, committed by a citizen of the Russian Federation.\" The sentence is imprisonment for 12 to 20 years. It is not a capital offence, even though murder and some aggravated forms of attempted murder are (although Russia currently has a moratorium on the death penalty). Subsequent sections provide for further offences against state security, such as armed rebellion and forcible seizure of power.\n\nSweden's treason laws have seen little application in modern times. The most recent case was in 2001. Four teenagers (their names were not reported) were convicted of treason after they assaulted King Carl XVI Gustaf with a strawberry cream cake on 6 September that year. They were fined between 80 and 100 days' income.\n\nThere is no single crime of treason in Swiss law; instead, multiple criminal prohibitions apply. Article 265 of the Swiss Criminal Code prohibits \"high treason\" (\"Hochverrat/haute trahison\") as follows:\n\nWhoever commits an act with the objective of violently\n– changing the constitution of the Confederation or of a canton,\n– removing the constitutional authorities of the state from office or making them unable to exercise their authority,\n– separating Swiss territory from the Confederation or territory from a canton,\nshall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year.\nA separate crime is defined in article 267 as \"diplomatic treason\" (\"Diplomatischer Landesverrat/Trahison diplomatique\"):\n\n1. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to a foreign state or its agents, (...) shall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year.\n2. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to the public, shall be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a monetary penalty.\nIn 1950, in the context of the Cold War, the following prohibition of \"foreign enterprises against the security of Switzerland\" was introduced as article 266:\n\nThe criminal code also prohibits, among other acts, the suppression or falsification of legal documents or evidence relevant to the international relations of Switzerland (art. 267, imprisonment of no less than a year) and attacks against the independence of Switzerland and incitement of a war against Switzerland (art. 266, up to life imprisonment).\n\nThe Swiss military criminal code contains additional prohibitions under the general title of \"treason\", which also apply to civilians, or which in times of war civilians are also (or may by executive decision be made) subject to. These include espionage or transmission of secrets to a foreign power (art. 86); sabotage (art. 86a); \"military treason\", i.e., the disruption of activities of military significance (art. 87); acting as a franc-tireur (art. 88); disruption of military action by disseminating untrue information (art. 89); military service against Switzerland by Swiss nationals (art. 90); or giving aid to the enemy (art. 91). The penalties for these crimes vary, but include life imprisonment in some cases.\n\nTreason \"per se\" is not defined in the Turkish Penal Code. However, the law defines crimes which are traditionally included in the scope of treason, such as cooperating with the enemy during wartime. Treason is punishable by imprisonment up to life.\n\nThe British law of treason is entirely statutory and has been so since the Treason Act 1351 (25 Edw. 3 St. 5 c. 2). The Act is written in Norman French, but is more commonly cited in its English translation.\n\nThe Treason Act 1351 has since been amended several times, and currently provides for four categories of treasonable offences, namely:\nAnother Act, the Treason Act 1702 (1 Anne stat. 2 c. 21), provides for a fifth category of treason, namely:\nBy virtue of the Treason Act 1708, the law of treason in Scotland is the same as the law in England, save that in Scotland the slaying of the Lords of Session and Lords of Justiciary and counterfeiting the Great Seal of Scotland remain treason under sections 11 and 12 of the Treason Act 1708 respectively. Treason is a reserved matter about which the Scottish Parliament is prohibited from legislating. Two acts of the former Parliament of Ireland passed in 1537 and 1542 create further treasons which apply in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe penalty for treason was changed from death to a maximum of imprisonment for life in 1998 under the Crime And Disorder Act. Before 1998, the death penalty was mandatory, subject to the royal prerogative of mercy. Since the abolition of the death penalty for murder in 1965 an execution for treason was unlikely to have been carried out.\n\nTreason laws were used against Irish insurgents before Irish independence. However, members of the Provisional IRA and other militant republican groups were not prosecuted or executed for treason for levying war against the British government during the Troubles. They, along with members of loyalist paramilitary groups, were jailed for murder, violent crimes or terrorist offences. William Joyce (\"Lord Haw-Haw\") was the last person to be put to death for treason, in 1946. (On the following day Theodore Schurch was executed for treachery, a similar crime, and was the last man to be executed for a crime other than murder in the UK.)\nAs to who can commit treason, it depends on the ancient notion of allegiance. As such, all British nationals (but not other Commonwealth citizens) owe allegiance to the Queen in right of the United Kingdom wherever they may be, as do Commonwealth citizens and aliens present in the United Kingdom at the time of the treasonable act (except diplomats and foreign invading forces), those who hold a British passport however obtained, and aliens who – having lived in Britain and gone abroad again – have left behind family and belongings.\n\nThe Treason Act 1695 enacted, among other things, a rule that treason could be proved only in a trial by the evidence of two witnesses to the same offence. Nearly one hundred years later this rule was incorporated into the U.S. Constitution, which requires two witnesses to the same overt act. It also provided for a three-year time limit on bringing prosecutions for treason (except for assassinating the king), another rule which has been imitated in some common law countries. The Sedition Act 1661 made it treason to imprison, restrain or wound the king. Although this law was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1998, it still continues to apply in some Commonwealth countries.\n\nIn the 1790s, opposition political parties were new and not fully accepted. Government leaders often considered their opponents to be traitors. Historian Ron Chernow reports that Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and President George Washington \"regarded much of the criticism fired at their administration as disloyal, even treasonous, in nature.\" When an undeclared Quasi-War broke out with France in 1797–98, \"Hamilton increasingly mistook dissent for treason and engaged in hyperbole.\" Furthermore, the Jeffersonian opposition party behaved the same way. After 1801, with a peaceful transition in the political party in power, the rhetoric of \"treason\" against political opponents diminished.\n\nTo avoid the abuses of the English law, the scope of treason was specifically restricted in the United States Constitution. Article III, section 3 reads as follows:\n\nThe Constitution does not itself create the offense; it only restricts the definition (the first paragraph), permits the United States Congress to create the offense, and restricts any punishment for treason to only the convicted (the second paragraph). The crime is prohibited by legislation passed by Congress. Therefore, the United States Code at states: \n\nThe requirement of testimony of two witnesses was inherited from the British Treason Act 1695.\n\nHowever, Congress has passed laws creating related offenses that punish conduct that undermines the government or the national security, such as sedition in the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts, or espionage and sedition in the Espionage Act of 1917, which do not require the testimony of two witnesses and have a much broader definition than Article Three treason. Some of these laws are still in effect. Some well-known spies, such as Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, have been convicted of espionage rather than treason.\n\nIn the United States, Benedict Arnold's name is considered synonymous with treason due to his collaboration with the British during the American Revolutionary War. However, this occurred before the Constitution was written. Arnold became a general in the British Army, which protected him.\n\nSince the Constitution came into effect, there have been fewer than 40 federal prosecutions for treason and even fewer convictions. Several men were convicted of treason in connection with the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion but were pardoned by President George Washington.\n\nThe most famous treason trial, that of Aaron Burr in 1807, resulted in acquittal. In 1807, on a charge of treason, Burr was brought to trial before the United States Circuit Court at Richmond, Virginia. The only physical evidence presented to the grand jury was Wilkinson's so-called letter from Burr, which proposed the idea of stealing land in the Louisiana Purchase. The trial was presided over by Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall, acting as a circuit judge. Since no witnesses testified, Burr was acquitted in spite of the full force of Jefferson's political influence thrown against him. Immediately afterward, Burr was tried on a misdemeanor charge and was again acquitted.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, treason trials were held in Indianapolis against Copperheads for conspiring with the Confederacy against the United States. After the war the question was whether the United States government would make indictments for treason against leaders of the Confederate States of America, as many people demanded. Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, was indicted and held in prison for two years. The indictment was dropped in 1869 when the political scene had changed and it was possible he would be acquitted by a jury in Virginia. When accepting Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, at Appomattox, in April 1865, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assured all Confederate soldiers and officers a blanket amnesty, provided they returned to their homes and refrained from any further acts of hostility, and subsequently other Union generals issued similar terms of amnesty when accepting Confederate surrenders. All Confederate officials received a blanket amnesty issued by President Andrew Johnson as he left office in 1869.\n\nIn 1949 Iva Toguri D'Aquino was convicted of treason for wartime radio broadcasts (under the name of \"Tokyo Rose\") and sentenced to ten years, of which she served six. As a result of prosecution witnesses having lied under oath, she was pardoned in 1977.\n\nIn 1952 Tomoya Kawakita, a Japanese-American dual citizen was convicted of treason and sentenced to death for having worked as an interpreter at a Japanese POW camp and having mistreated American prisoners. He was recognized by a former prisoner at a department store in 1946 after having returned to the United States. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. He was released and deported in 1963.\n\nThe Cold War saw frequent talk linking treason with support for Communist-led causes. The most memorable of these came from Senator Joseph McCarthy, who used rhetoric about the Democrats as guilty of \"twenty years of treason\". As chosen chair of the Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee, McCarthy also investigated various government agencies for Soviet spy rings (see the Venona project); however, he acted as a political fact-finder rather than a criminal prosecutor. The Cold War period saw no prosecutions for explicit treason, but there were convictions and even executions for conspiracy to commit espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union, such as in the Julius and Ethel Rosenberg case.\n\nOn October 11, 2006, the United States government charged Adam Yahiye Gadahn for videos in which he appeared as a spokesman for al-Qaeda and threatened attacks on American soil. He was killed on January 19, 2015 in an unmanned aircraft (drone) strike in Waziristan, Pakistan.\n\nMost states have treason provisions in their constitutions or statutes similar to those in the U.S. Constitution. The Extradition Clause specifically defines treason as an extraditable offense.\n\nThomas Jefferson in 1791 said that any Virginia official who cooperated with the federal Bank of the United States proposed by Alexander Hamilton was guilty of \"treason\" against the state of Virginia and should be executed. The Bank opened and no one was prosecuted.\n\nSeveral persons have been prosecuted for treason on the state level. Thomas Dorr was convicted for treason against the state of Rhode Island for his part in the Dorr Rebellion, but was eventually granted amnesty. John Brown was convicted of treason against the Commonwealth of Virginia for his part in the raid on Harpers Ferry, and was hanged. The Mormon prophet, Joseph Smith, was charged with treason against Missouri along with five others, at first in front of a state military court, but Smith was allowed to escape to Illinois after his case was transferred to a civilian court for trial on charges of treason and other crimes. Smith was then later imprisoned for trial on charges of treason against Illinois, but was murdered by a lynch mob while in jail awaiting trial.\n\nThe Constitution of Vietnam proclaims that treason is the most serious crime. It is further regulated in the Criminal Code with the 78th article:\nAlso, according to the Law on Amnesty amended in November 2018, it is impossible for those convicted for treason to be granted amnesty.\n\nEarly in Islamic history, the only form of treason was seen as the attempt to overthrow a just government or waging war against the State. According to Islamic tradition, the prescribed punishment ranged from imprisonment to the severing of limbs and the death penalty depending on the severity of the crime. However, even in cases of treason the repentance of a person would have to be taken into account.\n\nCurrently, the consensus among major Islamic schools is that apostasy (leaving Islam) is considered treason and that the penalty is death; this is supported not in the Quran but in hadith. This confusion between apostasy and treason almost certainly had its roots in the Ridda Wars, in which an army of rebel traitors led by the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylima attempted to destroy the caliphate of Abu Bakr.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th century, the Iranian Cleric Sheikh Fazlollah Noori opposed the Iranian Constitutional Revolution by inciting insurrection against them through issuing fatwas and publishing pamphlets arguing that democracy would bring vice to the country. The new government executed him for treason in 1909.\n\nIn Malaysia, it is treason to commit offences against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong's person, or to wage or attempt to wage war or abet the waging of war against the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, a Ruler or Yang di-Pertua Negeri. All these offences are punishable by hanging, which derives from the English treason acts (as a former British colony, Malaysia's legal system is based on English common law).\n\nIn Algeria, treason is defined as the following:\n\nIn Bahrain, plotting to topple the regime, collaborating with a foreign hostile country and threatening the life of the Emir are defined as treason and punishable by death. The State Security Law of 1974 was used to crush dissent that could be seen as treasonous, which was criticised for permitting severe human rights violations in accordance with Article One:\n\nIn the areas controlled by the Palestinian National Authority, it is treason to give assistance to Israeli troops without the authorization of the Palestinian Authority or to sell land to Jews (irrespective of nationality) and also non-Jewish Israeli citizens under the Palestinian Land Laws, as part of the PA's general policy of discouraging the expansion of Israeli settlements. Both crimes are capital offences subject to the death penalty, although the former provision has not often been enforced since the beginning of effective security cooperation between the Israel Defense Forces, Israel Police, and Palestinian National Security Forces since the mid-2000s (decade) under the leadership of Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. Likewise, in the Gaza Strip under the Hamas-led government, any sort of cooperation or assistance to Israeli forces during military actions is also punishable by death.\n\nThere are a number of other crimes against the state short of treason:\n\n\nDifferent cultures have evolved a variety of terms for \"traitor\" or collaborator, often based on historical incidences of treason to that culture or of people whose name has become a byword for treason.\n\n\n\n"}

Its most famous showing was at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, where it attracted national controversy. The work was composed of 50 pounds of raw flank steaks sewn together, and hung on a hanger. According to the artist, the work is a contrast between vanity and bodily decomposition.\nThe artwork is in the collections of Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and of Centre Pompidou in Paris (edition of 2 + artist copy).\n\nThe artwork consists of a \"Flesh Dress\", constructed of slabs of beef sewn together, hung on a tailor's dummy. On a nearby wall is a framed photograph of a model posing in the dress. The dress is stitched together from 50-60 pounds of raw flank steak and must be constructed anew each time it is shown. The work included either $260 or $300 worth of meat, as of its 1991 showing.\n\nAs suggested by the title, the work is considered within the genre of \"vanitas\", a category of art showing death and decay. The work includes non-traditional materials, a trend in 20th-century art. It \"stands in the Surrealist tradition of the uncanny, of the \"informe\", disturbing the distinctions, by which we categorize experience\".\n\nThere were some earlier instances of meat being used as clothing in art. Seafood outfits, including a lobster bikini, were featured at Salvador Dalí's \"The Dream of Venus\" pavilion at the 1939 World's Fair. The cover of The Undertones' November 1983 compilation album, \"All Wrapped Up\", showed a female model wearing cuts of meat held in place with plastic wrap. The clothes are mostly bacon, with a sausage necklace. In 2010, singer Lady Gaga attended an awards show wearing a meat dress similar to Sterbak's in style.\n\nMontreal gallery Galerie Rene Blouin exhibited the \"Flesh Dress\" in 1987. The exhibit received \"scant\" attention.\nAt age 36, Sterbak was given a retrospective show at the National Gallery of Canada called \"States of Being\", reviewing the past decade of her works. Scheduled from 8 March to 21 May 1991, the exhibit included works like \"Cone on Hand\" (1979). The exhibit was relatively well-attended, compared to other shows, due in part to the controversy, and was discussed in the catalog \"Jana Sterbak: States of Being = corps à corps\".\n\nWhen the meat was shriveling, flaking, and falling off, one anonymous donor gave the gallery $260 for replacement meat. (This number was of some debate, with $350 worth of meat listed in one vegetarian magazine.) Because of the negative publicity the work had received, gallery staff pretended to be caterers when finding a butcher in the Ottawa area to provide replacement meat.\n\nIn 1993, the T. B. Walker Acquisition Fund purchased a copy of the work for the Walker Art Center, in Minnesota. It was reconstructed by a small team in 2011, for the show \"Midnight Party\".\n\nThe work was later exhibited at the Tate Modern in London, for the exhibition \"Rites of Passage\". When the small retrospective of her work was taken to Antoni Tàpies Foundation in Barcelona, the show was \"edited down to an arid minimum\" by the artist herself, which included editing out the dress. In 2011, the work was presented at \"Tous Cannibales\" at \"la Maison Rouge\" and in 2010 at Elles@Centre Pompidou, Paris Jana Sterbak / Couture sanglante.\n\nThe work was one in a series of controversies surrounding the National Gallery of Canada in the 1980s and 1990s, including the acquisition of Barnett Newman's \"Voice of Fire\" (1967), less than a year before. The show drew criticism from Members of Parliament, and the organizers of food banks and soup kitchens. It was considered an insult, given the early 1990s recession.\n\nProgressive Conservative MP Felix Holtmann, a pig farmer from Manitoba commented: \"I call it a jerky dress. There are a lot of people who hold food sacred in this land, and they are appalled by the use of food for this thing.\" In response, one newspaper editorial called him a \"meat head\". Holtmann was chair of the House of Commons Communications and Culture Committee, which oversees the NGC funding; the committee itself was split on the issue. The artist called Holtmann a \"self-proclaimed Philistine [who is] not even successful as a hog farmer.\" Art critic Christopher Hume commented that the Committee's concept \"was based on the notion that the National Gallery is somehow accountable for poverty and hunger in Canada. Surely the irony of their desperate position is that \"they\" are members of the group that created the mess the country is now in.\"\n\nOttawa alderman Mark Maloney called health inspectors, who found that there the work presented no health hazards. Inspected on 1 April, Dr. Edward Ellis of the Ottawa-Carlton Health Department issued a statement that the dress presented \"no health hazard to the public at this time\", so long as no one touches or eats it. The inspector also suggested the dress was out of their jurisdiction, being on a federal property; the department asked Health and Welfare Canada to follow up.\n\n\"The Toronto Sun\" and its sister paper, the \"Ottawa Sun\", printed a cartoon featuring \"a curvy, spaghetti-strapped slip\" made of the same materials as the meat dress. The editorial cartoon suggested readers cut out the image, smear it with foodstuffs, and mail it to [show curator Diana] Nemiroff; her address was included with the image. The mailroom opened mail with gloves for weeks after the cartoon; one was covered in feces. A sexually-threatening letter was sent to the NGC communications officer, who had been quoted in articles about the work. The writer for \"Canadian Art\" suggested reaction would have been different if the genders of the artist and curator were different, that the work would have likely been deemed sexist, for starters. In all, 200 people mailed food scraps to the National Gallery of Canada within a week.\n\nContemporary Canadian art curator Diana Nemiroff suggested the controversy was largely due to the work being taken out of the larger context of the show. \"There's no doubt that the dress is a provocative object and it's meant to be a provocative object, but the cry that it's a waste of food is misplaced.\" She noted that other exhibits have used grains, breads, and potatoes were used as part of previous exhibits, but the flesh was likely source of the controversy. Said Nemiroff: \"It's kind of double cross because clothing is supposed to be second skin and cover us up. And this one reverses the process and reveals what we don't want to confront: our mortality.\"\n\nThe film \"The Silence of the Lambs\", about a man who butchers women, was released around the same time, a coincidence noted by a writer for \"Canadian Art\" magazine.\n\nIn various critical reviews, the work of German Joseph Beuys was referenced; a 1996 work by Sterbak portrayed her as a moth, eating up the clothes in his closet. \"New York Times\" writer Ann Wilson Lloyd noted in 1998 that Sterbak's work \"has inspired reams of humorless, abstruse theoretical writing that leaves none of her layered metaphors unturned. Yet Ms. Sterbak's work – seductive, intensely physical and edged with dark absurdity – delivers a mind-body frisson unknowable by intellect alone.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2406648", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2406648", "title": "Violence Against Women Act", "text": "Violence Against Women Act\n\nThe Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA) is a United States federal law (Title IV, sec. 40001-40703 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, ) signed as by President Bill Clinton on September 13, 1994 (codified in part at 42 U.S.C. sections 13701 through 14040). The Act provided $1.6 billion toward investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, imposed automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave un-prosecuted. The Act also established the Office on Violence Against Women within the Department of Justice.\n\nVAWA was drafted by the office of Senator Joe Biden (D-DE) and co-written by Democrat Louise Slaughter, the Representative from New York, with support from a broad coalition of advocacy groups. The Act passed through Congress with bipartisan support in 1994, clearing the United States House of Representatives by a vote of 235–195 and the Senate by a vote of 61–38, although the following year House Republicans attempted to cut the Act's funding. In the 2000 Supreme Court case \"United States v. Morrison\", a sharply divided Court struck down the VAWA provision allowing women the right to sue their attackers in federal court. By a 5–4 majority, the Court overturned the provision as exceeding the federal government's powers under the Commerce Clause.\n\nVAWA was reauthorized by bipartisan majorities in Congress in 2000 (H.R. 1248, Roll Call 415-3), and again in December 2005, and signed by President George W. Bush. The Act's 2012 renewal was opposed by conservative Republicans, who objected to extending the Act's protections to same-sex couples and to provisions allowing battered illegal immigrants to claim temporary visas. Ultimately, VAWA was again reauthorized in 2013, after a long legislative battle throughout 2012–2013.\n\nThe World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna, Austria, in 1993, and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that domestic violence is a public health policy and human rights concern. In the United States, according to the National Intimate Partner Sexual Violence Survey of 2010 1 in 6 women suffered some kind of sexual violence induced by their intimate partner during the course of their lives.\n\nThe Violence Against Women Act was developed and passed as a result of extensive grassroots efforts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with advocates and professionals from the battered women's movement, sexual assault advocates, victim services field, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors' offices, the courts, and the private bar urging Congress to adopt significant legislation to address domestic and sexual violence [citation needed]. One of the greatest successes of VAWA is its emphasis on a coordinated community response to domestic violence, sex dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; courts, law enforcement, prosecutors, victim services, and the private bar currently work together in a coordinated effort that did not exist before at the state and local levels [citation needed]. VAWA also supports the work of community-based organizations that are engaged in work to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; particularly those groups that provide culturally and linguistically specific services. Additionally, VAWA provides specific support for work with tribes and tribal organizations to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking against Native American women.\n\nMany grant programs authorized in VAWA have been funded by the U.S. Congress. The following grant programs, which are administered primarily through the Office on Violence Against Women in the U.S. Department of Justice have received appropriations from Congress:\n\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had originally expressed concerns about the Act, saying that the increased penalties were rash, that the increased pretrial detention was \"repugnant\" to the U.S. Constitution, that the mandatory HIV testing of those only charged but not convicted was an infringement of a citizen’s right to privacy, and that the edict for automatic payment of full restitution was non-judicious (see their paper: \"Analysis of Major Civil Liberties Abuses in the Crime Bill Conference Report as Passed by the House and the Senate\", dated September 29, 1994). The ACLU has, however, supported reauthorization of VAWA on the condition that the \"unconstitutional DNA provision\" be removed.\n\nThe ACLU, in its July 27, 2005 'Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197' stated that \"VAWA is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It has dramatically improved the law enforcement response to violence against women and has provided critical services necessary to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations\".\n\nSome activists oppose the bill. Janice Shaw Course, a senior fellow at Concerned Women for America's Beverly LaHaye Institute called the Act a \"boondoggle\" which \"ends up creating a climate of suspicion where all men are feared or viewed as violent and all women are viewed as victims\". She described the Act as creating a \"climate of false accusations, rush to judgment and hidden agendas\" and criticized it for failing to address the factors identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as leading to violent, abusive behavior. Conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly denounced VAWA as a tool to \"fill feminist coffers\" and argued that the Act promoted \"divorce, breakup of marriage and hatred of men\".\n\nIn 2000, the Supreme Court of the United States held part of VAWA unconstitutional in \"United States v. Morrison\" on federalism grounds. In that decision, only the civil rights remedy of VAWA was struck down. The provisions providing program funding were unaffected.\n\nIn 2005, the reauthorization of VAWA (as HR3402) defined what population benefited under the term of \"Underserved Populations\" described as \" Populations underserved because of geographic location, underserved racial and ethnic populations, populations underserved because of special needs (such as language barriers, disabilities, alienage status, or age) and any other population determined to be underserved by the Attorney General or by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as appropriate\". The reauthorization also \"Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968\" to \"prohibit officials from requiring sex offense victims to submit to a polygraph examination as a condition for proceeding with an investigation or prosecution of a sex offense.\"\n\nIn 2011, the law expired. In 2012 the law was up for reauthorization in Congress. Different versions of the legislation have been passed along party lines in the Senate and House, with the Republican-sponsored House version favoring the reduction of services to undocumented immigrants and LGBT individuals. Another area of contention is the provision of the law giving Native American tribal authorities jurisdiction over sex crimes involving non-Native Americans on tribal lands. This provision is considered to have constitutional implications, as non-tribes people are under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government and are granted the protections of the U.S. Constitution, protections that tribal courts do not often have. The two bills were pending reconciliation, and a final bill did not reach the President's desk before the end of the year, temporarily ending the coverage of the Act after 18 years, as the 112th Congress adjourned.\n\nThe Act's 2012 renewal was opposed by conservative Republicans, who objected to extending the Act's protections to same-sex couples and to provisions allowing battered undocumented individuals to claim temporary visas, also known as U visas. The U visa is restricted to 10,000 applicants annually whereas the number of applicants far exceeds these 10,000 for each fiscal year. In order to be considered for the U visa, one of the requirements for immigrant women is that they need to cooperate in the detention of the abuser. Studies show that 30 to 50% of immigrant women are suffering from physical violence and 62% experience physical or psychological abuse in contrast to only 21% of citizens in the United States.\n\nIn April 2012, the Senate voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and the House subsequently passed its own measure (omitting provisions of the Senate bill that would protect gays, Native Americans living in reservations, and immigrants who are victims of domestic violence). Reconciliation of the two bills was stymied by procedural measures, leaving the re-authorization in question. The Senate's 2012 re-authorization of VAWA was not brought up for a vote in the House.\n\nIn 2013, the question of jurisdiction over offenses in Indian country continued to be at issue over the question of whether defendants who are not tribal members would be treated fairly by tribal courts or afforded constitutional guarantees.\n\nOn February 12, 2013, the Senate passed an extension of the Violence Against Women Act by a vote of 78–22. The measure went to the House of Representatives where jurisdiction of tribal courts and inclusion of same-sex couples were expected to be at issue. Possible solutions advanced were permitting either removal or appeal to federal courts by non-tribal defendants. The Senate had tacked on the Trafficking Victims Protection Act which is another bone of contention due to a clause which requires provision of reproductive health services to victims of sex trafficking.\n\nOn February 28, 2013, in a 286–138 vote, the House passed the Senate's all-inclusive version of the bill. House Republicans had previously hoped to pass their own version of the measure—one that substantially weakened the bill's protections for certain categories. The stripped down version, which allowed only limited protection for LGBT and Native Americans, was rejected 257 to 166. The renewed act expanded federal protections to gay, lesbian, and transgender individuals, Native Americans and immigrants.\n\nOn March 7, 2013, President Barack Obama signed the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013.\n\nThe U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposed portions of the act that addressed the categories \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\", calling the sections unnecessary to achieve equal protection of all persons.\n\n138 House Republicans voted against the version of the act that became law. However, several, including Steve King (R-Iowa), Bill Johnson (R-Ohio), Tim Walberg (R-Michigan), Vicky Hartzler (R-Missouri), Keith Rothfus (R-Pennsylvania), and Tim Murphy (R-Pennsylvania), claimed to have voted in favor of the act. Some have called this claim disingenuous because the group only voted in favor of a GOP proposed alternative version of the bill that did not contain provisions intended to protect gays, lesbians and transgender individuals, Native Americans and undocumented immigrants.\n\nOn September 12, 2013, at an event marking the 19th anniversary of the bill, Vice President Joe Biden criticized the Republicans who slowed the passage of the reauthorization of the act as being \"this sort of Neanderthal crowd\".\n\nThe Violence Against Women laws provide programs and services, including:\n\nWhen a woman—the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence generally refers to petitioners as female as most are women—is the beneficiary of an order of protection, per VAWA it is generally enforceable nationwide under the terms of full faith and credit. Although the order may be granted only in a specific state, full faith and credit requires that it be enforced in other states as though the order was granted in their states.\n\nVAWA allows for the possibility that certain individuals who might not otherwise be eligible for immigration benefits may petition for US permanent residency on the grounds of a close relationship with a US citizen or permanent resident who has been abusing them. The following persons are eligible to benefit from the immigration provisions of VAWA:\n\nAlthough the title of the Act and the titles of its sections refer to victims of domestic violence as women, the operative text is gender-neutral, providing coverage for male victims as well. Individual organizations have not been successful in using VAWA to provide equal coverage for men. The law has twice been amended in attempts to address this situation. The 2005 reauthorization added a non-exclusivity provision clarifying that the title should not be construed to prohibit male victims from receiving services under the Act. The 2013 reauthorization added a non-discrimination provision that prohibits organizations receiving funding under the Act from discriminating on the basis of sex, although the law allows an exception for \"sex segregation or sex-specific programming\" when it is deemed to be \"necessary to the essential operations of a program.\" Jan Brown, the Founder and Executive Director of the Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men and Women contends that the Act may not be sufficient to ensure equal access to services.\n\nOfficial federal government groups that have developed, being established by President Barack Obama, in relation to the Violence Against Women Act include the White House Council on Women and Girls and the White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault. The ultimate aims of both groups are to help improve and/or protect the well-being and safety of women and girls in the United States.\n\n\n"}

Mumler (1832–1884) was an American spirit photographer who worked in New York and Boston. His first spirit photograph was apparently an accident—a self-portrait which, when developed, also revealed the \"spirit\" of his deceased cousin. Mumler then left his job as an engraver to pursue spirit photography full-time, taking advantage of the large number of people who had lost relatives in the American Civil War. His two most famous images are the photograph of Mary Todd Lincoln with the ghost of her husband Abraham Lincoln and the portrait of Master Herrod, a medium, with three spirit guides.\n\nMumler was eventually taken to court and tried for fraud and larceny. Noted showman P. T. Barnum testified against him. Though the judge acquitted him (Mumler's trial was not by jury), the event ruined his career and Mumler died in poverty. Today, Mumler's photographs are recognized as fakes but they circulated widely during the last quarter of the 19th century and were marketed as objects of belief and visual curiosities both within and beyond the spiritualist movement.\n\nBefore beginning his career as a spirit photographer, Mumler worked as a jewellery engraver in Boston, practicing amateur photography in his spare time. In the early 1860s, he developed a self-portrait that appeared to feature the apparition of his cousin who had been dead for 12 years. This is widely credited as the first \"spirit photograph\"—a photograph of a living subject featuring the likeness of a deceased person (often a relative) imprinted by the spirit of the deceased. Mumler then became a full-time spirit photographer, continuing to work in Boston but eventually moving to New York City, where his work was analyzed by numerous photography experts, none of whom could find any evidence of fraud. Spirit photography was a lucrative business thanks to the enormous death tolls that resulted from the American Civil War, and the thousands of families who sought reassurance that their loved ones live on after death.\n\nMumler's wife, Hannah Mumler, was also a famous \"healing medium,\" and conducted her own spiritual business in addition to the business of assisting her husband.\n\nCritics of Mumler's work included P. T. Barnum, who claimed that Mumler was taking advantage of people whose judgment was clouded by grief. Barnum's accusation was one of many in a chorus voices that had accused Mumler of staging \"ghosts\" of people who were still in fact living, and breaking into houses to steal photos of deceased relatives. According to Joe Nickell \"Mumler was exposed as a fraud when people recognized that some of the supposed spirits were still among the living.\" Mumler was eventually brought to trial for fraud in April 1869. Barnum testified against him, having hired Abraham Bogardus to create a picture that appeared to show Barnum with the ghost of Abraham Lincoln to demonstrate the ease with which such \"spirit photographers\" could be created. Those testifying in support of Mumler included Moses A. Dow, a journalist whom Mumler had photographed. Ultimately Mumler was acquitted because the prosecution could not prove beyond all doubt that he was fabricating the photographs, but following the trial his career never fully recovered.\n\nMumler continued working in photography (though never spirit photography), and later discovered a process by which photo-electrotype plates could be produced and printed as easily as woodcuts (known as the \"Mumler Process\"). He died in 1884, and his obituary focused on his photographic contributions in general, making only a passing reference to the earlier spirit photography scandal in the last line. (\"The deceased at one time gained considerable notoriety in connection with spirit photographs.\")\n\nMumler's most famous photograph apparently shows Mary Todd Lincoln with the \"ghost\" of her husband, Abraham Lincoln. Paranormal researcher Melvyn Willin, in his book \"Ghosts Caught on Film\", claims that the photo was taken around 1869, and that Mumler did not know that his sitter was Lincoln, instead believing her to be a 'Mrs Tundall'. Willin goes on to say that Mumler did not discover who she was until after the photo was developed. The College of Psychic Studies, referencing notes belonging to William Stainton Moses (who has appeared in photographs by other spirit photographers), claim that the photo was taken in the early 1870s, that Mrs. Lincoln assumed the name of 'Mrs. Lindall,' and that she had to be encouraged by Mumler's wife (a medium) to identify her husband on the photo. Although the image has been dismissed as a fraudulent double exposure, it has been widely circulated.\n\nMaster Herrod was a young medium from Bridgewater, Massachusetts photographed by Mumler in about 1872. One photograph, once developed, apparently showed Herrod in a trance surrounded by the spirits of Europe, Africa and America. The photograph was advertised for sale in \"The Religio-Philosophical Journal\" on August 24, 1872.\n\nOther photographs by Mumler included pictures showing various spirits (including relatives, fiancés, actresses and spirit guides) with living sitters. Other well-known sitters include Moses A. Dow (editor of \"The Waverley Magazine\") whose photograph apparently showed the spirit of his assistant Mabel Warren, and Fanny Conant, a well-known medium from Boston, apparently photographed with the ghost of her brother Chas.\n\n\n"}
