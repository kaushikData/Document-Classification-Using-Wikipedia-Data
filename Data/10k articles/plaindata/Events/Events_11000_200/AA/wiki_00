{"id": "2966372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2966372", "title": "Alhambra Theatre", "text": "Alhambra Theatre\n\nThe Alhambra was a popular theatre and music hall located on the east side of Leicester Square, in the West End of London. It was built originally as the Royal Panopticon of Science and Arts opening on 18 March 1854. It was closed after two years and reopened as the Alhambra. The building was demolished in 1936. The name was also adopted by many other British music hall theatres located elsewhere; in Bradford, in Hull and in Glasgow etc. The name comes from association with the Moorish splendour of the Alhambra palace in Granada, Spain.\n\nThe Alhambra was originally known as the Royal Panopticon and was a landmark building at 23–27 Leicester Square, completed in 1854 by T. Hayter Lewis as a venue for showcasing the finest in the arts and for scientific demonstrations and popular education. This lasted for two years, and then the decision to add a circus ring was taken. When it reopened on 3 April 1858 it was renamed the Alhambra.\n\nThe 1858 building conversion to the \"Alhambra Circus\", was also by T. Hayter Lewis. It had a frontage and was very tall for the time. It was built in a Moorish style, with lavish fenestration, two towers and a dome, similar to the eponymous Bradford theatre in architectural style. It was a complete contrast with the neighbouring buildings. Inside there was a central rotunda in diameter and high. There was a secondary entrance to the rear on Charing Cross Road.\nThe Leicester Square theatre's name was changed frequently, but usually reflected the building's (very loose) stylistic associations with the celebrated Alhambra in Granada, Spain. By 1864, the circus had become the Alhambra Music Hall. Rebuildings occurred in 1866 and 1881, by Perry and Reed. From 1871, when it obtained a licence, an equestrian ballet was performed. The Alhambra was destroyed by fire in 1882, and was rebuilt in a more restrained style by Reed, reopening in 1884 as the Alhambra Theatre. Further rebuildings were in 1888 by Edward Clark, 1892 by Clark and Pollard, 1897 by W. M. Brutton, and in 1912 by the prolific theatre architect, Frank Matcham. Other names used during the life of the theatre were the Royal Alhambra Palace; Alhambra Theatre of Varieties; Theatre Royal, Alhambra; Great United States Circus and New Alhambra Theatre.\n\nLondon's Alhambra was predominantly used for the popular entertainment of the day, music hall. The usual music hall acts were performed, as well as the début of Jules Léotard performing his aerial act, above the heads of diners in May 1861. Other entertainments included \"patriotic demonstrations\" celebrating the British Empire and British military successes. The theatre also staged ballet and light opera. In the 1860s, John Hollingshead took over management at the Alhambra and made it famous for its sumptuous staging, alluring corps de ballet and the notorious front-of-house Promenade bar. At its bars, the attractions of the Alhambra's ballet were not merely artistic:\n\nThe \"Can-Can\" as presented at the Alhambra by the 'Parisian Colonna' troupe proved so sexually provocative that in October 1870 the Alhambra was deprived of its dancing licence.\n\nAnother example of the fare on offer was this 1882 production, written by Dion Boucicault and J. R. Planche:\n\nEarly films were also a part of the entertainment, with Robert W. Paul, a former collaborator of Birt Acres, presenting his first theatrical programme on 25 March 1896. This included films featuring cartoonist Tom Merry drawing caricatures of the German Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm II (1895), and Prince Bismarck (1895). Merry had previously performed his lightning fast drawing as part of a music hall stage act.\n\nDuring World War I, a series of hit revues played at the Alhambra that included \"The Bing Boys Are Here\" (1916), which featured the first performances of the song \"If You Were The Only Girl In The World\", performed by Violet Lorraine and George Robey . This was followed by \"The Bing Boys on Broadway\" (1917) and \"The Bing Boys are There\" (1918). The music for the revues was written by Nat D. Ayer with lyrics by Clifford Grey, and the text was by George Grossmith, Jr.\n\nLike many other theatres, the Alhambra went into decline after World War I owing to the increasing popularity of cinema and radio. It was demolished in 1936 to make way for the Odeon Leicester Square, which remains on the site. The entrance on Charing Cross Road has also been demolished and is now a modern office block.\n\n\n"}

Traditionally, bachelor parties involved a black tie banquet hosted by the father of the groom that included a toast in honour of the groom and bride. Since the 1980s, bachelor parties in the United States have involved vacationing to a foreign destination, or have featured female company such as strippers or topless waitresses.\n\nThe bachelor party dates back as early as the 5th century B.C. The ancient Spartans celebrated the groom's last night as a single man in which they held a dinner and made toasts on his behalf.\n\nIn 1896, Herbert Barnum Seeley, a grandson of P. T. Barnum, threw a stag party (known as the \"Awful Seeley Dinner\") for his brother at restaurant Sherry's in New York City. The party had a dancer, nicknamed \"Little Egypt\", who allegedly danced naked in desserts. The party was dissolved in the early morning by an officer. Afterwards, the Seeley family brought the police officer to the police board trial for \"conduct unbecoming to an officer of the law.\" At that time, that incident brought the light to the \"behind closed doors\" matters with bachelor parties.\n\nThe term \"bachelor\", originally meaning \"a young knight-in-training\", was firstly mentioned in the 14th century to refer to an unmarried man in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"The Canterbury Tales\". In 1922, the term \"bachelor party\" was published in William Chambers's \"Journal of Literature, Science and Arts\" and was described as a \"jolly old\" party.\n\nThe equivalent event for the bride-to-be is known as a bachelorette party or hens' night.\n\nSome also choose instead to hold a so-called \"stag and doe\" party in the US, or a \"hag party\" or \"hag do\" in the UK (\"hag\" being a combination of the words \"hen\" and \"stag\"), in which both the bride and groom attend.\n\nIn Germany, this event is called \"Junggesellenabschied\", which literally means \"bachelor farewell\". There is also a separate event that the couple celebrates together on the evening prior to their wedding, called \"Polterabend\". At the Polterabend, the guests break old porcelain and earthenware to bring luck to the couple's marriage. The tradition is said to go back to pre-Christian times; by noisily breaking ceramics, evil spirits – especially spirits of envy – are supposed to be driven out. In the last couple of years, Anglo-style bachelor parties have become more and more popular among bachelors. In parts of northern Germany that lack a Carnival tradition, funny costuming has become a popular part of bachelor or bachelorette parties.\n\nSome parts of Germany have a related custom, in which a person who is not yet married by their 30th birthday, is made to dress up in an embarrassing fashion by their friends and to do silly tasks that most often include some kind of cleaning work.\n\nIn France and in many French-speaking regions such as Quebec, the bachelor party is called ', which literally means \"(the) burial of the life as a boy\" or \"burial/funeral of the life as a bachelor\". For women it is ', translated as \"burial/funeral of the life as a young girl/maiden\". As in English-speaking countries, such parties often feature heavy drinking and various (although gentle) humiliations, and sometimes the presence of a stripper.\n\nIn Israel, the bachelor party is called \"\", literally meaning a party of single men. Such parties may feature heavy drinking and sometimes the presence of strippers, or else other recreational bonding activities undertaken together, such as paintball or an overseas trip lasting a few days.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, it is now common for the party to last for more than one evening, hence the increasing prevalence of the phrase \"stag weekend\", or \"stag do\". A spin-off has been the growth of the stag weekend industry in the UK with various companies taking over the preparation of the event.\n\nIn the UK, stag weekend trips are becoming mini-holidays with the groups taking part in various day-time activities as well as the expected night out on the town. They may involve travelling to another location in the UK or going abroad, with Kraków, Dublin, and Riga topping the list, followed by Prague, Amsterdam, Bratislava, and Budapest. Stag parties abroad have been known to involve visits to brothels and prostitutes.\n\nIn the United States, Las Vegas is both a popular bachelor party destination and location for the wedding itself. Increasingly, \"destination bachelor parties\" are replacing standard nights out, with Americans traveling to Montreal, Quebec or Mexico.\n\nBachelor parties in the US stereotypically entail the mass consumption of alcohol, hiring a stripper, and general rowdiness toward which the bride might not have a positive reaction; in fact, the defining feature of the bachelor party is that the fiancée is not present. Increasingly, bachelor parties have come to symbolize the last time when the groom is free of the influence of his new wife/partner. Pop out cakes are sometimes associated.\n\nCanadian bachelor parties generally consist of a group of bachelors celebrating their singleness.\n\nCanadian cities such as Vancouver or Niagara Falls are popular stag party destinations due to their large number of strip clubs with \"dance contact\" (lap dancing). Montreal in particular is popular for this purpose with both Canadians and Americans alike.\n\nAs an alternative, the best man may plan an activity in secret with friends that they feel the groom will enjoy. Many grooms-to-be have been treated to camping trips with friends, fishing trips, sporting events, video games, poker, barbecuing, and other activities.\n\n"}

In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled \"Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus\" presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary, which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis. By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on Podcast interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.\n\nBruce Burgess returned to the subject matter with \"The Bloodline of Christ\" that was shown in September 2013 on the Yesterday channel.\n"}
{"id": "623031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=623031", "title": "Borley Rectory", "text": "Borley Rectory\n\nBorley Rectory was a Victorian house that gained infamy as \"the most haunted house in England\" after being described as such by psychic researcher Harry Price. Built in 1862 to house the rector of the parish of Borley and his family, it was badly damaged by fire in 1939 and demolished in 1944.\n\nThe large Gothic-style rectory in the village of Borley had been alleged to be haunted ever since it was built. These reports multiplied suddenly in 1929, after the \"Daily Mirror\" published an account of a visit by paranormal researcher Harry Price, who wrote two books supporting claims of paranormal activity.\n\nThe uncritical acceptance of Price's reports prompted a formal study by the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price's credibility. His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public fascination with the rectory.\n\nA short programme commissioned by the BBC about the alleged manifestations, scheduled to be broadcast in September 1956, was cancelled owing to concerns about a possible legal action by Marianne Foyster, widow of the last rector to live in the house.\nBorley Rectory was constructed on Hall Road near Borley Church by the Reverend Henry Dawson Ellis Bull in 1862; he moved in a year after being named rector of the parish. The house replaced an earlier rectory on the site that had been destroyed by fire in 1841. It was eventually enlarged by the addition of a wing to house Bull's family of fourteen children.\n\nThe nearby church, the nave of which may date from the 12th century, serves a scattered rural community of three hamlets that make up the parish. There are several substantial farmhouses and the fragmentary remains of Borley Hall, once the seat of the Waldegrave family. Ghost hunters quote the legend of a Benedictine monastery supposedly built in this area in about 1362, according to which a monk from the monastery conducted a relationship with a nun from a nearby convent. After their affair was discovered, the monk was executed and the nun bricked up alive in the convent walls. It was confirmed in 1938 that this legend had no historical basis and seemed to have been fabricated by the rector's children to romanticise their Gothic-style red-brick rectory. The story of the walling-up of the nun may have come from Rider Haggard's novel \"Montezuma's Daughter\" (1893) or Walter Scott's epic poem \"Marmion\" (1808).\n\nThe first paranormal events reportedly occurred in about 1863, since a few locals later remembered having heard unexplained footsteps within the house at about that time. On 28 July 1900, four daughters of the rector, Henry Dawson Ellis Bull, saw what they thought was the ghost of a nun at twilight, about from the house; they tried to talk to it, but it disappeared as they got closer. The local organist, Ernest Ambrose later said that the family at the rectory were \"very convinced that they had seen an apparition on several occasions\". Various people claimed to have witnessed a variety of puzzling incidents, such as a phantom coach driven by two headless horsemen, during the next four decades. Bull died in 1892 and his son, the Reverend Henry (\"Harry\") Foyster Bull, took over the living.\n\nOn 9 June 1928, Harry Bull died and the rectory again became vacant. In the following year, on the second day October, the Reverend Guy Eric Smith and his wife moved into the house. Soon after moving in, Smith's wife, while cleaning out a cupboard, came across a brown paper package containing the skull of a young woman. Shortly after, the family reported a variety of incidents including the sounds of servant bells ringing despite their being disconnected, lights appearing in windows and unexplained footsteps. In addition, Smith's wife believed she saw a horse-drawn carriage at night. The Smiths contacted the \"Daily Mirror\" asking to be put in touch with the Society for Psychical Research (SPR). On 10 June 1929 the newspaper sent a reporter, who promptly wrote the first in a series of articles detailing the mysteries of Borley. The paper also arranged for Harry Price, a paranormal researcher, to make his first visit to the house. He arrived on 12 June and immediately phenomena of a new kind appeared, such as the throwing of stones, a vase and other objects. \"Spirit messages\" were tapped out from the frame of a mirror. As soon as Price left, these ceased. Smith's wife later maintained that she already suspected Price, an expert conjurer, of falsifying the phenomena.\n\nThe Smiths left Borley on 14 July 1929 and the parish had some difficulty in finding a replacement. The following year the Reverend Lionel Algernon Foyster (1878–1945), a first cousin of the Bulls, and his wife Marianne (née Marianne Emily Rebecca Shaw) (1899–1992) moved into the rectory with their adopted daughter Adelaide, on 16 October 1930. Lionel Foyster wrote an account of various strange incidents that occurred between the time the Foysters moved in and October 1935, which was sent to Harry Price. These included bell-ringing, windows shattering, throwing of stones and bottles, wall-writing and the locking of their daughter in a room with no key. Marianne Foyster reported to her husband a whole range of poltergeist phenomena that included her being thrown from her bed. On one occasion, Adelaide was attacked by \"something horrible\". Foyster tried twice to conduct an exorcism, but his efforts were fruitless; in the middle of the first exorcism, he was struck in the shoulder by a fist-size stone. Because of the publicity in the \"Daily Mirror\", these incidents attracted the attention of several psychic researchers, who after investigation were unanimous in suspecting that they were caused, consciously or unconsciously, by Marianne Foyster. She later said that she felt that some of the incidents were caused by her husband in concert with one of the psychic researchers, but other events appeared to her to be genuine paranormal phenomena. She later admitted that she was having a sexual relationship with the lodger, Frank Pearless, and that she used paranormal explanations to cover up her liaisons. The Foysters left Borley in October 1935 as a result of Lionel Foyster's ill health.\n\nBorley remained vacant for some time after the Foysters' departure. In May 1937, Price took out a year-long rental agreement with Queen Anne's Bounty, the owners of the property.\n\nThrough an advertisement in \"The Times\" on 25 May 1937 and subsequent personal interviews, Price recruited a corps of 48 \"official observers\", mostly students, who spent periods, mainly during weekends, at the rectory with instructions to report any phenomena that occurred. In March 1938 Helen Glanville (the daughter of S. J. Glanville, one of Price's helpers) conducted a planchette séance in Streatham in south London. Price reported that she made contact with two spirits, the first of which was that of a young nun who identified herself as Marie Lairre. According to the planchette story Marie was a French nun who left her religious order and travelled to England to marry a member of the Waldegrave family, the owners of Borley's 17th-century manor house, Borley Hall. She was said to have been murdered in an older building on the site of the rectory, and her body either buried in the cellar or thrown into a disused well. The wall writings were alleged to be her pleas for help; one read \"Marianne, please help me get out\".\n\nThe second spirit to be contacted identified himself as Sunex Amures, and claimed that he would set fire to the rectory at nine o'clock that night, 27 March 1938. He also said that, at that time, the bones of a murdered person would be revealed.\n\nOn 27 February 1939 the new owner of the rectory, Captain W. H. Gregson, was unpacking boxes and accidentally knocked over an oil lamp in the hallway. The fire quickly spread and the house was severely damaged. After investigating the cause of the blaze the insurance company concluded that the fire had been started deliberately.\n\nA Miss Williams from nearby Borley Lodge said she saw the figure of the ghostly nun in the upstairs window and, according to Harry Price, demanded a fee of one guinea for her story. In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman. The bones were given a Christian burial in Liston churchyard, after the parish of Borley refused to allow the ceremony to take place on account of the local opinion that the bones found were those of a pig.\n\nAfter Price's death in 1948, \"Daily Mail\" reporter Charles Sutton accused him of faking phenomena. Sutton claimed that whilst visiting the rectory with Price in 1929 he was hit on the head by a large pebble. Sutton stated that he seized Price and found his coat pockets filled with different sized stones.\n\nIn 1948, Eric Dingwall, K. M. Goldney and Trevor H. Hall, three members of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), two of whom had been Price's most loyal associates, investigated his claims about Borley. Their findings were published in a 1956 book, \"The Haunting of Borley Rectory\", which concluded that Price had fraudulently produced some of the phenomena.\n\nThe \"Borley Report\", as the SPR study has become known, stated that many of the phenomena were either faked or due to natural causes such as rats and the strange acoustics attributed to the odd shape of the house. In their conclusion, Dingwall, Goldney, and Hall wrote \"when analysed, the evidence for haunting and poltergeist activity for each and every period appears to diminish in force and finally to vanish away.\" Terence Hines wrote that \"Mrs. Marianne Foyster, wife of the Rev. Lionel Foyster who lived at the rectory from 1930 to 1935, was actively engaged in fraudulently creating [haunted] phenomena. Price himself 'salted the mine' and faked several phenomena while he was at the rectory.\"\n\nMarianne Foyster, later in her life, admitted she had seen no apparitions and that the alleged ghostly noises were caused by the wind, friends she invited to the house and in other cases by herself playing practical jokes on her husband. Many of the legends about the rectory had been invented. The children of the Rev. Harry Bull who lived in the house before Lionel Foyster claimed to have seen nothing and were surprised they had been living in what was described as England's most haunted house.\n\nRobert Hastings was one of the few SPR researchers to defend Price. Price's literary executor Paul Tabori and Peter Underwood have also defended Price against accusations of fraud. A similar approach was made by Ivan Banks in 1996. Michael Coleman in an SPR report in 1997 wrote Price's defenders are unable to rebut the criticisms convincingly.\n\n\n\n"}

(Moha) meaning the big and Sangkrant means the journey of the Sun.and the first day of the angels becomes earth. Moha Sangkrant is 13 April every year, but the holiday period extends from 14-15 April and some time from 16 April. Moha Sangkrant Khmer Festival 'extended to seven-day holiday, The word \"Moha Songkrant\" comes from the People dress up and light candles and burn incense sticks at shrines, where the members of each family pay homage to offer thanks for the [[Buddha]]'s teachings by bowing, kneeling and prostrating themselves three times in front of his image.

Son and Daughter wash their parents for gratitude of giving birth.\n\nIn temples, people erect a sand hillock on temple grounds. They mound up a big pointed hill of sand or dome in the center which represents [[Valuka]] [[Chaitya]], the stupa at Tavatimsa where the Buddha's hair and [[diadem]] are buried. The big stupa is surrounded by four small ones, which represent the stupas of the Buddha's favorite disciples: [[Sariputta]], [[Maudgalyayana|Moggallana]], [[Ananda]], and [[Maha Kassapa]]. There is another tradition called () : pouring water or liquid plaster (a mixture of water with some chalk powder) on elder relative, or people (mostly the younger generation is responsible for pouring the water).\n\nThe Khmer New Year is also a time to prepare special dishes. One of these is a \"[[kralan]]\": a cake made from [[steamed rice]] mixed with beans or peas, grated coconut and coconut milk. The mixture is stuffed inside a bamboo stick and slowly roasted.\n\n[[File:Khmer New Year GA2010-128.jpg|thumb|right|220px]]\n[[File:Cambodge_Khmer_new_year_4.JPG|thumb|220px]]\nCambodia is home to a variety of games played to transform the dull days into memorable occasions. These games are similar to those played in [[Manipur]], a north-eastern state in India. Throughout the Khmer New Year, street corners often are crowded with friends and families enjoying a break from routine, filling their free time with dancing and games. Typically, Khmer games help maintain one's mental and physical dexterity.\n[[Tug of war]] (also known as Lbeng Teanh Prot[ in Khmer: ល្បែងទាញព្រ័ត្រ] war of tug, tug o' war, tug war, rope war, rope pulling, tugging war or Afrikaans: toutrek) is a sport that directly puts two teams against each other in a test of strength: teams pull on opposite ends of a rope, with the goal being to bring the rope a certain distance in one direction against the force of the opposing team's pull.\nA game played especially on the first nightfall of the Khmer New Year by two groups of boys and girls. Ten or 20 people comprise each group, standing in two rows opposite each other. One group throws the to the other group. When it is caught, it will be rapidly thrown back to the first group. If someone is hit by the , the whole group must dance to get the back while the other group sings to the dance.\nA game played by imitating a [[Chicken|hen]] as she protects her chicks from a [[crow]]. Adults typically play this game on the night of the first New Year's Day. Participants usually appoint a strong player to play the hen who protects \"her\" chicks, while another person is picked to be the \"crow\". While both sides sing a song of bargaining, the crow tries to catch as many chicks as possible as they hide behind the hen.\nThe simple style consists of just throwing the Ongkunhs to hit the target Ongkunhs. The extended style adds five more stages in addition to the throwing stage. Both styles end with a penalty called Jours-activity that the winning team members get to perform on the losing team members. The Jours-activity is performed by using the Onkunghs the hit the knees of the losing team.\nA game played by a group of children sitting in a circle. Someone holding a \"kanseng\" (Cambodian towel) that is twisted into a round shape walks around the circle while singing a song. The person walking secretly tries to place the \"kanseng\" behind one of the children. If that chosen child realizes what is happening, he or she must pick up the \"kanseng\" and beat the person sitting next to him or her.\nA game played by two children in rural or urban areas during their leisure time. Ten holes are dug in the shape of an oval into a board in the ground. The game is played with 42 small beads, stones or fruit seeds. Before starting the game, five beads are put into each of the two holes located at the tip of the board. Four beads are placed in each of the remaining eight holes. The first player takes all the beads from any hole and drops them one by one in the other holes. He or she must repeat this process until they have dropped the last bead into a hole that lies besides any empty one. Then they must take all the beads in the hole that follows the empty one. At this point, the second player may have his turn. The game ends when all the holes are empty. The player with the greatest number of beads wins the game. It is possibly similar to congkak.\n\n[[Category:New Year celebrations]]\n[[Category:Cambodian culture]]\n[[Category:Buddhist holidays]]\n[[Category:Non-Gregorian April observances]]\n[[Category:Observances on non-Gregorian calendars]]"}

He was the only person prosecuted in connection with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and was acquitted.\n\nShaw, a native of Kentwood, Louisiana, was the son of Glaris Lenora Shaw, a United States Marshal, and Alice Shaw. His grandfather had been the sheriff of Tangipahoa Parish. When he was five, Shaw's family moved to New Orleans, where he eventually attended Warren Easton High School.\n\nShaw served as an officer in the United States Army during World War II. He served as secretary to the General Staff and later served in Europe. He was decorated by three nations: the United States with the Legion of Merit and Bronze Star, by France with the Croix de Guerre and named Chevalier de l'Ordre du Merite, and by Belgium named Chevalier of the Order of the Crown of Belgium. Shaw was honorably discharged from the United States Army as a major in 1946.\n\nAfter World War II Shaw helped start the International Trade Mart in New Orleans which facilitated the sales of both domestic and imported goods. He was known locally for his efforts to preserve buildings in New Orleans' historic French Quarter.\n\nShaw was also a published playwright. The best-known of his works, \"Submerged\" (1929), was co-authored with H. Stuart Cottman when both were still high-school students.\n\nNew Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison prosecuted Clay Shaw on the charge that Shaw and a group of activists, including David Ferrie and Guy Banister, were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the John F. Kennedy assassination. Garrison arrested Shaw on March 1, 1967. Garrison believed that Shaw was the man named as \"Clay Bertrand\" in the Warren Commission Report. Garrison said that Shaw used the alias Clay Bertrand in New Orleans' gay society.\n\nDuring the trial, which took place in January–February 1969, Garrison called insurance salesman Perry Russo as his main witness. Russo testified that he had attended a party at the apartment of anti-Castro activist David Ferrie. At the party, Russo said that Lee Harvey Oswald (who Russo said was introduced to him as \"Leon Oswald\"), David Ferrie, and \"Clay Bertrand\" (who Russo identified in the courtroom as Shaw) had discussed killing Kennedy. The conversation included plans for the \"triangulation of crossfire\" and alibis for the participants.\n\nCritics of Garrison argue that his own records indicate that Russo's story had evolved over time. A key source was the \"Sciambra Memo,\" which recorded Assistant D.A. Andrew Sciambra's first interview with Russo. The memo does not mention an \"assassination party,\" and says that Russo met with Shaw on two occasions, neither of which occurred at the party.\n\nOn March 1, 1969, Shaw was found not guilty on all charges after the jury deliberated for less than one hour. Despite his acquittal, Shaw's reputation and public image never fully recovered.\n\nA heavy smoker most of his life, Clay Shaw died on about 12:40 AM at his residence, 1022 St. Peter Street. The death certificate was signed by Dr. Hugh M. Batson, with the cause of death listed as metastatic lung cancer. Shaw was buried in Woodland Cemetery in Kentwood, Louisiana.\n\nAt the time of his death, Shaw was engaged in a $5 million suit against Garrison and members of an organization, Truth and Consequences Inc., that financed Garrison's investigation. As Shaw had no surviving relatives, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the suit in 1978.\n\n\nTommy Lee Jones portrayed Shaw in Oliver Stone's 1991 film \"JFK\".

{"id": "13121116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13121116", "title": "Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki", "text": "Debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\n\nThe debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki concerns the ethical, legal, and military controversies surrounding the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 August and 9 August 1945 at the close of World War II (1939–45). The Soviet Union declared war on Japan an hour before 9 August and invaded Manchuria at one minute past midnight; Japan surrendered on 15 August.\n\nOn 26 July 1945, United States President Harry S. Truman, United Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Chairman of the Chinese Nationalist Government Chiang Kai-shek issued the Potsdam Declaration, which outlined the terms of surrender for the Empire of Japan as agreed upon at the Potsdam Conference. This ultimatum stated if Japan did not surrender, it would face \"prompt and utter destruction\". Some debaters focus on the presidential decision-making process, and others on whether or not the bombings were the proximate cause of Japanese surrender.\n\nOver the course of time, different arguments have gained and lost support as new evidence has become available and as new studies have been completed. A primary and continuing focus has been on the role of the bombings in Japan's surrender and the U.S.'s justification for them based upon the premise that the bombings precipitated the surrender. This remains the subject of both scholarly and popular debate. In 2005, in an overview of historiography about the matter, J. Samuel Walker wrote, \"the controversy over the use of the bomb seems certain to continue\". Walker stated, \"The fundamental issue that has divided scholars over a period of nearly four decades is whether the use of the bomb was necessary to achieve victory in the war in the Pacific on terms satisfactory to the United States.\"\n\nSupporters of the bombings generally assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing massive casualties on both sides in the planned invasion of Japan: Kyūshū was to be invaded in November 1945 and Honshū four months later. It was thought Japan would not surrender unless there was an overwhelming demonstration of destructive capability. Those who oppose the bombings argue it was militarily unnecessary, inherently immoral, a war crime, or a form of state terrorism. Critics believe a naval blockade and conventional bombings would have forced Japan to surrender unconditionally. Some critics believe Japan was more motivated to surrender by the Soviet Union's invasion of Manchuria and other Japanese-held areas.\n\nThose who argue in favor of the decision to drop the atomic bombs on enemy targets believe massive casualties on both sides would have occurred in Operation Downfall, the planned Allied invasion of Japan. The bulk of the force invading Japan would be American although the British Commonwealth would contribute three divisions of troops (one each from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia).\n\nThe U.S. anticipated losing many combatants in Downfall, although the number of expected fatalities and wounded is subject to some debate. U.S. President Harry S. Truman stated in 1953 he had been advised U.S. casualties could range from 250,000 to one million combatants. Assistant Secretary of the Navy Ralph Bard, a member of the Interim Committee on atomic matters, stated that while meeting with Truman in the summer of 1945 they discussed the bomb's use in the context of massive combatant and non-combatant casualties from invasion, with Bard raising the possibility of a million Allied combatants being killed. As Bard opposed using the bomb without warning Japan first, he cannot be accused of exaggerating casualty expectations to justify the bomb's use, and his account is evidence that Truman was aware of, and government officials discussed, the possibility of one million casualties.\n\nA quarter of a million casualties is roughly the level the Joint War Plans Committee estimated, in its paper (JWPC 369/1) prepared for Truman's 18 June meeting. A review of documents from the Truman Library shows Truman's initial draft response to the query describes Marshall only as saying \"one quarter of a million would be the minimum\". The \"as much as a million\" phrase was added to the final draft by Truman's staff, so as not to appear to contradict an earlier statement given in a published article by Stimson (former Secretary of War). In a study done by the Joint Chiefs of Staff in April 1945, the figures of 7.45 casualties per 1,000 man-days and 1.78 fatalities per 1,000 man-days were developed. This implied the two planned campaigns to conquer Japan would cost 1.6 million U.S. casualties, including 380,000 dead. JWPC 369/1 (prepared June 15, 1945) which provided planning information to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, estimated an invasion of Japan would result in 40,000 U.S. dead and 150,000 wounded. Delivered on June 15, 1945, after insight gained from the Battle of Okinawa, the study noted Japan's inadequate defenses resulting from a very effective sea blockade and the Allied firebombing campaign. Generals George C. Marshall and Douglas MacArthur signed documents agreeing with the Joint War Plans Committee estimate.\n\nIn addition, a large number of Japanese combatant and non-combatant casualties were expected as a result of such actions. Contemporary estimates of Japanese deaths from an invasion of the Home Islands range from several hundreds of thousands to as high as ten million. General MacArthur's staff provided an estimated range of American deaths depending on the duration of the invasion, and also estimated a 22:1 ratio of Japanese to American deaths. From this, a low figure of somewhat more than 200,000 Japanese deaths can be calculated for a short invasion of two weeks, and almost three million Japanese deaths if the fighting lasted four months. A widely cited estimate of five to ten million Japanese deaths came from a study by William Shockley and Quincy Wright; the upper figure was used by Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy, who characterized it as conservative. Some 400,000 additional Japanese deaths might have occurred in the expected Soviet invasion of Hokkaido, the northernmost of Japan's main islands, although the Soviets lacked the naval capability to invade the Japanese home islands, let alone to take Hokkaido. An Air Force Association webpage states that \"Millions of women, old men, and boys and girls had been trained to resist by such means as attacking with bamboo spears and strapping explosives to their bodies and throwing themselves under advancing tanks.\" The AFA noted that \"[t]he Japanese cabinet had approved a measure extending the draft to include men from ages fifteen to sixty and women from seventeen to forty-five (an additional 28 million people)\".\n\nThe great loss of life during the battle of Iwo Jima and other Pacific islands gave U.S. leaders an idea of the casualties that would happen with a mainland invasion. Of the 22,060 Japanese combatants entrenched on Iwo Jima, 21,844 died either from fighting or by ritual suicide. Only 216 Japanese POWs were held at the hand of the Americans during the battle. According to the official Navy Department Library website, \"The 36-day (Iwo Jima) assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead\" with 19,217 wounded. To put this into context, the 82-day Battle of Okinawa lasted from early April until mid-June 1945 and U.S. casualties (out of five Army and two Marine divisions) were above 62,000, of which more than 12,000 were killed or missing.\n\nThe U.S. military had nearly 500,000 Purple Heart medals manufactured in anticipation of potential casualties from the planned invasion of Japan. To date, all American military casualties of the 60 years following the end of World War II, including the Korean and Vietnam Wars, have not exceeded that number. In 2003, there were still 120,000 of these Purple Heart medals in stock. Because of the number available, combat units in Iraq and Afghanistan were able to keep Purple Hearts on hand for immediate award to wounded soldiers on the field.\n\nSupporters of the bombings argue waiting for the Japanese to surrender would also have cost lives. \"For China alone, depending upon what number one chooses for overall Chinese casualties, in each of the ninety-seven months between July 1937 and August 1945, somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 persons perished, the vast majority of them noncombatants. For the other Asian states alone, the average probably ranged in the tens of thousands per month, but the actual numbers were almost certainly greater in 1945, notably due to the mass death in a famine in Vietnam. Historian Robert P. Newman concluded that each month that the war continued in 1945 would have produced the deaths of 'upwards of 250,000 people, mostly Asian but some Westerners.'\"\n\nThe end of the war limited the expansion of the Japanese controlled Vietnamese famine of 1945, stopping it at 1–2 million deaths and also liberated millions of Allied prisoners of war and civilian laborers working in harsh conditions under a forced mobilization. In the Dutch East Indies, there was a \"forced mobilization of some 4 million—although some estimates are as high as 10 million—\"romusha\" (manual laborers) ... About 270,000 romusha were sent to the Outer Islands and Japanese-held territories in Southeast Asia, where they joined other Asians in performing wartime construction projects. At the end of the war, only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\" \n\nSupporters also point to an order given by the Japanese War Ministry on August 1, 1944, ordering the execution of Allied POWs, \"when an uprising of large numbers cannot be suppressed without the use of firearms\" or when the POW camp was in the combat zone, in fear that \"escapees from the camp may turn into a hostile fighting force\".\n\nThe \"Operation Meetinghouse\" firebombing raid on Tokyo alone killed 100,000 civilians on the night of March 9–10, 1945, causing more civilian death and destruction than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A total of 350,000 civilians died in the incendiary raids on 67 Japanese cities. Because the United States Army Air Forces wanted to use its fission bombs on previously undamaged cities in order to have accurate data on nuclear-caused damage, Kokura, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Niigata were preserved from conventional bombing raids. Otherwise, they would all have been firebombed. Intensive conventional bombing would have continued or increased prior to an invasion. The submarine blockade and the United States Army Air Forces's mining operation, Operation Starvation, had effectively cut off Japan's imports. A complementary operation against Japan's railways was about to begin, isolating the cities of southern Honshū from the food grown elsewhere in the Home Islands. \"Immediately after the defeat, some estimated that 10 million people were likely to starve to death\", noted historian Daikichi Irokawa. Meanwhile, fighting continued in the Philippines, New Guinea and Borneo, and offensives were scheduled for September in southern China and Malaya. The Soviet invasion of Manchuria had, in the week before the surrender, caused over 80,000 deaths.\n\nIn September 1945, nuclear physicist Karl Taylor Compton, who himself took part in the Manhattan Project, visited MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo, and following his visit wrote a defensive article, in which he summarized his conclusions as follows: \n\nPhilippine justice Delfin Jaranilla, member of the Tokyo tribunal, wrote in his judgment:\nLee Kuan Yew, the Former Prime Minister of Singapore concurred:\n\nLee witnessed his home city being invaded by the Japanese and was nearly executed in the Sook Ching Massacre.\n\nSupporters of the bombings have argued the Japanese government had promulgated a National Mobilization Law and waged total war, ordering many civilians (including women, children, and old people) to work in factories and other infrastructure attached to the war effort and to fight against any invading force. Unlike the United States and Nazi Germany, over 90% of the Japanese war production was done in unmarked workshops and cottage industries which were widely dispersed within residential areas in cities and thus making them more extensively difficult to find and attack. In addition, the dropping of high explosives with precision bombing was unable to penetrate Japan's dispersed industry, making it entirely impossible to destroy them without causing widespread damage to surrounding areas. General Curtis LeMay stated why he ordered the systematic carpet bombing of Japanese cities:\nFor six months prior to the use of nuclear weapons in combat, the United States Army Air Forces under LeMay's command undertook a major strategic bombing campaign against Japanese cities through the use of incendiary bombs, destroying 67 cities and killing an estimated 350,000 civilians. The \"Operation Meetinghouse\" raid on Tokyo on the night of 9/10 March 1945 stands as the deadliest air raid in human history, killing 100,000 civilians and destroying of the city that night, which caused more civilian deaths and damage to urbanized land than any other single air attack, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki combined.\n\nColonel Harry F. Cunningham, an intelligence officer of the Fifth Air Force, noted that in addition to civilians producing weapons of war in cities, the Japanese government created a large civilian militia organization in order to train millions of civilians to be armed and to resist the American invaders. In his official intelligence review on July 21, 1945, he declared that:\nSupporters of the bombings have emphasized the strategic significance of the targets. Hiroshima was used as headquarters of the Second General Army and Fifth Division, which commanded the defense of southern Japan with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. The city was also a communication center, an assembly area for combatants, a storage point, and had major industrial factories and workshops as well, and its air defenses consisted of five batteries of 7-cm and 8-cm (2.8 and 3.1 inch) anti-aircraft guns. Nagasaki was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of ordnance, warships, military equipment, and other war material. The city's air defenses consisted of four batteries of 7 cm (2.8 in) anti-aircraft guns and two searchlight batteries. An estimated 110,000 people were killed in the atomic bombings, including 20,000 Japanese combatants and 20,000 Korean slave laborers in Hiroshima and 23,145–28,113 Japanese factory workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese combatants in Nagasaki.\n\nOn 30 June 2007, Japan's defense minister Fumio Kyūma said the dropping of atomic bombs on Japan by the United States during World War II was an inevitable way to end the war. Kyūma said: \"I now have come to accept in my mind that in order to end the war, it could not be helped (shikata ga nai) that an atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and that countless numbers of people suffered great tragedy.\" Kyūma, who is from Nagasaki, said the bombing caused great suffering in the city, but he does not resent the U.S. because it prevented the Soviet Union from entering the war with Japan. Kyūma's comments were similar to those made by Emperor Hirohito when, in his first ever press conference given in Tokyo in 1975, he was asked what he thought of the bombing of Hiroshima, and answered: \"It's very regrettable that nuclear bombs were dropped and I feel sorry for the citizens of Hiroshima but it couldn't be helped (shikata ga nai) because that happened in wartime.\"\n\nIn early July 1945, on his way to Potsdam, Truman had re-examined the decision to use the bomb. In the end, he made the decision to drop the atomic bombs on strategic cities. His stated intention in ordering the bombings was to save American lives, to bring about a quick resolution of the war by inflicting destruction, and instilling fear of further destruction, sufficient to cause Japan to surrender. In his speech to the Japanese people presenting his reasons for surrender on August 15, the Emperor referred specifically to the atomic bombs, stating if they continued to fight it would not only result in \"an ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but also it would lead to the total extinction of human civilization\".\n\nCommenting on the use of the atomic bomb, then-U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson stated, \"The atomic bomb was more than a weapon of terrible destruction; it was a psychological weapon.\"\n\nIn 1959, Mitsuo Fuchida, the pilot who led the first wave in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, met with General Paul Tibbets, who piloted the \"Enola Gay\" that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, and told him that:\nSome historians see ancient Japanese warrior traditions as a major factor in the resistance in the Japanese military to the idea of surrender. According to one Air Force account,\nJapanese militarism was aggravated by the Great Depression, and had resulted in countless assassinations of reformers attempting to check military power, among them Takahashi Korekiyo, Saitō Makoto, and Inukai Tsuyoshi. This created an environment in which opposition to war was a much riskier endeavor.\n\nAccording to historian Richard B. Frank,\n\nThe United States Department of Energy's history of the Manhattan Project lends some credence to these claims, saying that military leaders in Japan\nWhile some members of the civilian leadership did use covert diplomatic channels to attempt peace negotiation, they could not negotiate surrender or even a cease-fire. Japan could legally enter into a peace agreement only with the unanimous support of the Japanese cabinet, and in the summer of 1945, the Japanese Supreme War Council, consisting of representatives of the Army, the Navy, and the civilian government, could not reach a consensus on how to proceed.\n\nA political stalemate developed between the military and civilian leaders of Japan, the military increasingly determined to fight despite all costs and odds and the civilian leadership seeking a way to negotiate an end to the war. Further complicating the decision was the fact no cabinet could exist without the representative of the Imperial Japanese Army. This meant the Army or Navy could veto any decision by having its Minister resign, thus making them the most powerful posts on the SWC. In early August 1945, the cabinet was equally split between those who advocated an end to the war on one condition, the preservation of the \"kokutai\", and those who insisted on three other conditions:\n\nThe \"hawks\" consisted of General Korechika Anami, General Yoshijirō Umezu, and Admiral Soemu Toyoda and were led by Anami. The \"doves\" consisted of Prime Minister Kantarō Suzuki, Naval Minister Mitsumasa Yonai, and Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigenori Tōgō and were led by Togo. Under special permission of Hirohito, the president of the Privy council, Hiranuma Kiichirō, was also a member of the imperial conference. For him, the preservation of the \"kokutai\" implied not only the Imperial institution but also the Emperor's reign.\n\nJapan had an example of unconditional surrender in the German Instrument of Surrender. On 26 July, Truman and other Allied leaders—except the Soviet Union—issued the Potsdam Declaration outlining terms of surrender for Japan. The declaration stated, \"The alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction.\" It was not accepted, though there is debate on Japan's intentions. The Emperor, who was waiting for a Soviet reply to Japanese peace feelers, made no move to change the government position. In the PBS documentary \"Victory in the Pacific\" (2005), broadcast in the \"American Experience\" series, historian Donald Miller argues, in the days after the declaration, the Emperor seemed more concerned with moving the Imperial Regalia of Japan to a secure location than with \"the destruction of his country\". This comment is based on declarations made by the Emperor to Kōichi Kido on 25 and 31 July 1945, when he ordered the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan to protect \"at all cost\" the Imperial Regalia.\n\nIt has sometimes been argued Japan would have surrendered if simply guaranteed the Emperor would be allowed to continue as formal head of state. However, Japanese diplomatic messages regarding a possible Soviet mediation—intercepted through Magic, and made available to Allied leaders—have been interpreted by some historians to mean, \"the dominant militarists insisted on preservation of the old militaristic order in Japan, the one in which they ruled.\" On 18 and 20 July 1945, Ambassador Sato cabled to Foreign Minister Togo, strongly advocating that Japan accept an unconditional surrender provided that the U.S. preserved the imperial house (keeping the emperor). On 21 July, in response, Togo rejected the advice, saying that Japan would not accept an unconditional surrender under any circumstance. Togo then said that, \"Although it is apparent that there will be more casualties on both sides in case the war is prolonged, we will stand as united against the enemy if the enemy forcibly demands our unconditional surrender.\" They also faced potential death sentences in trials for Japanese war crimes if they surrendered. This was also what occurred in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and other tribunals.\n\nHistory professor Robert James Maddox wrote:\nMaddox also wrote, \"Even after both bombs had fallen and Russia entered the war, Japanese militants insisted on such lenient peace terms that moderates knew there was no sense even transmitting them to the United States. Hirohito had to intervene personally on two occasions during the next few days to induce hardliners to abandon their conditions.\" \"That they would have conceded defeat months earlier, before such calamities struck, is far-fetched to say the least.\"\n\nEven after the triple shock of the Soviet intervention and two atomic bombs, the Japanese cabinet was still deadlocked, incapable of deciding upon a course of action due to the power of the Army and Navy factions in cabinet, and of their unwillingness to even consider surrender. Following the personal intervention of the emperor to break the deadlock in favour of surrender, there were no less than three separate coup attempts by senior Japanese officers to try to prevent the surrender and take the Emperor into 'protective custody'. Once these coup attempts had failed, senior leaders of the air force and Navy ordered bombing and \"kamikaze\" raids on the U.S. fleet (in which some Japanese generals personally participated) to try to derail any possibility of peace. It is clear from these accounts that while many in the civilian government knew the war could not be won, the power of the military in the Japanese government kept surrender from even being considered as a real option prior to the two atomic bombs.\n\nAnother argument is that it was the Soviet declaration of war in the days between the bombings that caused the surrender. After the war, Admiral Soemu Toyoda said, \"I believe the Russian participation in the war against Japan rather than the atom bombs did more to hasten the surrender.\" Prime Minister Suzuki also declared that the entry of the USSR into the war made \"the continuance of the war impossible\". Upon hearing news of the event from Foreign Minister Togo, Suzuki immediately said, \"Let us end the war\", and agreed to finally convene an emergency meeting of the Supreme Council with that aim. The official British history, \"The War Against Japan\", also writes the Soviet declaration of war \"brought home to all members of the Supreme Council the realization that the last hope of a negotiated peace had gone and there was no alternative but to accept the Allied terms sooner or later\".\n\nThe \"one condition\" faction, led by Togo, seized on the bombing as decisive justification of surrender. Kōichi Kido, one of Emperor Hirohito's closest advisers, stated, \"We of the peace party were assisted by the atomic bomb in our endeavor to end the war.\" Hisatsune Sakomizu, the chief Cabinet secretary in 1945, called the bombing \"a golden opportunity given by heaven for Japan to end the war\".\n\nTruman felt that the effects of Japan witnessing a failed test would be too great of a risk to arrange such a demonstration.\n\nAssistant Secretary Bard was convinced that a standard bombardment and naval blockade would be enough to force Japan into surrendering. Even more, he had seen signs for weeks that the Japanese were actually already looking for a way out of the war. His idea was for the United States to tell the Japanese about the bomb, the impending Soviet entry into the war, and the fair treatment that citizens and the Emperor would receive at the coming Big Three conference. Before the bombing occurred, Bard pleaded with Truman to neither drop the bombs (at least not without warning the population first) nor to invade the entire country, proposing to stop the bloodshed.\n\nThe 1946 United States Strategic Bombing Survey in Japan, whose members included Paul Nitze, concluded the atomic bombs had been unnecessary to win the war. After reviewing numerous documents, and interviewing hundreds of Japanese civilian and military leaders after Japan surrendered, they reported:\n\nThis conclusion assumed conventional fire bombing would have continued, with ever-increasing numbers of B-29s, and a greater level of destruction to Japan's cities and population. One of Nitze's most influential sources was Prince Fumimaro Konoe, who responded to a question asking whether Japan would have surrendered if the atomic bombs had not been dropped by saying resistance would have continued through November or December 1945.\n\nHistorians such as Bernstein, Hasegawa, and Newman have criticized Nitze for drawing a conclusion they say went far beyond what the available evidence warranted, in order to promote the reputation of the Air Force at the expense of the Army and Navy.\n\nDwight D. Eisenhower wrote in his memoir \"The White House Years\":\n\nOther U.S. military officers who disagreed with the necessity of the bombings include General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy (the Chief of Staff to the President), Brigadier General Carter Clarke (the military intelligence officer who prepared intercepted Japanese cables for U.S. officials), Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz (Commander in Chief of the Pacific Fleet), Fleet Admiral William Halsey Jr. (Commander of the US Third Fleet), and even the man in charge of all strategic air operations against the Japanese home islands, then-Major General Curtis LeMay:\n\nStephen Peter Rosen of Harvard believes that a submarine blockade would have been sufficient to force Japan to surrender.\n\nHistorian Tsuyoshi Hasegawa wrote the atomic bombings themselves were not the principal reason for Japan's capitulation. Instead, he contends, it was the Soviet entry in the war on 8 August, allowed by the Potsdam Declaration signed by the other Allies. The fact the Soviet Union did not sign this declaration gave Japan reason to believe the Soviets could be kept out of the war. As late as 25 July, the day before the declaration was issued, Japan had asked for a diplomatic envoy led by Konoe to come to Moscow hoping to mediate peace in the Pacific. Konoe was supposed to bring a letter from the Emperor stating:\n\nHasegawa's view is, when the Soviet Union declared war on 8 August, it crushed all hope in Japan's leading circles that the Soviets could be kept out of the war and also that reinforcements from Asia to the Japanese islands would be possible for the expected invasion. Hasegawa wrote:\n\nWard Wilson wrote that \"after Nagasaki was bombed only four major cities remained which could readily have been hit with atomic weapons\", and that the Japanese Supreme Council did not bother to convene after the atomic bombings because they were barely more destructive than previous bombings. He wrote that instead, the Soviet declaration of war and invasion of Manchuria and South Sakhalin removed Japan's last diplomatic and military options for negotiating a \"conditional\" surrender, and this is what prompted Japan's surrender. He wrote that attributing Japan's surrender to a \"miracle weapon\", instead of the start of the Soviet invasion, saved face for Japan and enhanced the United States' world standing.\n\nA number of notable individuals and organizations have criticized the bombings, many of them characterizing them as war crimes, crimes against humanity, and/or state terrorism. Early critics of the bombings were Albert Einstein, Eugene Wigner and Leó Szilárd, who had together spurred the first bomb research in 1939 with a jointly written letter to President Roosevelt.\n\nSzilárd, who had gone on to play a major role in the Manhattan Project, argued:\n\nA number of scientists who worked on the bomb were against its use. Led by Dr. James Franck, seven scientists submitted a report to the Interim Committee (which advised the President) in May 1945, saying:\nMark Selden writes, \"Perhaps the most trenchant contemporary critique of the American moral position on the bomb and the scales of justice in the war was voiced by the Indian jurist Radhabinod Pal, a dissenting voice at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, who balked at accepting the uniqueness of Japanese war crimes. Recalling Kaiser Wilhelm II's account of his duty to bring World War I to a swift end—\"everything must be put to fire and sword; men, women and children and old men must be slaughtered and not a tree or house be left standing.\" Pal observed:\n\nSelden mentions another critique of the nuclear bombing, which he says the U.S. government effectively suppressed for twenty-five years, as worth mention. On 11 August 1945, the Japanese government filed an official protest over the atomic bombing to the U.S. State Department through the Swiss Legation in Tokyo, observing:\n\nSelden concludes, despite the war crimes committed by the Empire of Japan, nevertheless, \"the Japanese protest correctly pointed to U.S. violations of internationally accepted principles of war with respect to the wholesale destruction of populations\".\n\nIn 1963, the bombings were the subject of a judicial review in \"Ryuichi Shimoda et al. v. The State\". On the 22nd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the District Court of Tokyo declined to rule on the legality of nuclear weapons in general, but found, \"the attacks upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused such severe and indiscriminate suffering that they did violate the most basic legal principles governing the conduct of war.\"\n\nIn the opinion of the court, the act of dropping an atomic bomb on cities was at the time governed by international law found in the Hague Regulations on Land Warfare of 1907 and the Hague Draft Rules of Air Warfare of 1922–1923 and was therefore illegal.\n\nIn the documentary \"The Fog of War\", former U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara recalls General Curtis LeMay, who relayed the Presidential order to drop nuclear bombs on Japan, said:\n\nAs the first combat use of nuclear weapons, the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki represent to some the crossing of a crucial barrier. Peter Kuznick, director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University, wrote of President Truman: \"He knew he was beginning the process of annihilation of the species.\" Kuznick said the atomic bombing of Japan \"was not just a war crime; it was a crime against humanity.\"\n\nTakashi Hiraoka, mayor of Hiroshima, upholding nuclear disarmament, said in a hearing to The Hague International Court of Justice (ICJ): \"It is clear that the use of nuclear weapons, which cause indiscriminate mass murder that leaves [effects on] survivors for decades, is a violation of international law\". Iccho Itoh, the mayor of Nagasaki, declared in the same hearing:\nAlthough bombings do not meet the definition of genocide, some consider the definition too strict, and argue the bombings do constitute genocide. For example, University of Chicago historian Bruce Cumings states there is a consensus among historians to Martin Sherwin's statement, \"[T]he Nagasaki bomb was gratuitous at best and genocidal at worst\".\n\nThe scholar R. J. Rummel instead extends the definition of genocide to what he calls democide, and includes the major part of deaths from the atom bombings in these. His definition of democide includes not only genocide, but also an excessive killing of civilians in war, to the extent this is against the agreed rules for warfare; he argues the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were war crimes, and thus democide.\nRummel quotes among others an official protest from the US government in 1938 to Japan, for its bombing of Chinese cities: \"The bombing of non-combatant populations violated international and humanitarian laws.\" He also considers excess deaths of civilians in conflagrations caused by conventional means, such as in Tokyo, as acts of democide.\n\nIn 1967, Noam Chomsky described the atomic bombings as \"among the most unspeakable crimes in history\". Chomsky pointed to the complicity of the American people in the bombings, referring to the bitter experiences they had undergone prior to the event as the cause for their acceptance of its legitimacy.\n\nIn 2007, a group of intellectuals in Hiroshima established an unofficial body called International Peoples' Tribunal on the Dropping of Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. On 16 July 2007, it delivered its verdict, stating:\n\nAbout the legality and the morality of the action, the unofficial tribunal found:\nHistorical accounts indicate the decision to use the atomic bombs was made in order to provoke a surrender of Japan by use of an awe-inspiring power. These observations have caused Michael Walzer to state the incident was an act of \"war terrorism: the effort to kill civilians in such large numbers that their government is forced to surrender. Hiroshima seems to me the classic case.\"\nThis type of claim eventually prompted historian Robert P. Newman, a supporter of the bombings, to say \"there \"can\" be justified terror, as there can be just wars\".\n\nCertain scholars and historians have characterized the atomic bombings of Japan as a form of \"state terrorism\". This interpretation is based on a definition of terrorism as \"the targeting of innocents to achieve a political goal\". As Frances V. Harbour points out, the meeting of the Target Committee in Los Alamos on 10 and 11 May 1945 suggested targeting the large population centers of Kyoto or Hiroshima for a \"psychological effect\" and to make \"the initial use sufficiently spectacular for the importance of the weapon to be internationally recognized\". As such, Professor Harbour suggests the goal was to create terror for political ends both in and beyond Japan. However, Burleigh Taylor Wilkins believes it stretches the meaning of \"terrorism\" to include wartime acts.\n\nHistorian Howard Zinn wrote that the bombings were terrorism. Zinn cites the sociologist Kai Erikson who said that the bombings could not be called \"combat\" because they targeted civilians. Just War theorist Michael Walzer said that while taking the lives of civilians can be justified under conditions of 'supreme emergency', the war situation at that time did not constitute such an emergency.\n\nTony Coady, Frances V. Harbour, and Jamal Nassar also view the targeting of civilians during the bombings as a form of terrorism. Nassar classifies the atomic bombings as terrorism in the same vein as the firebombing of Tokyo, the firebombing of Dresden, and the Holocaust.\n\nRichard A. Falk, professor Emeritus of International Law and Practice at Princeton University has written in detail about Hiroshima and Nagasaki as instances of state terrorism. He said that \"the explicit function of the attacks was to terrorize the population through mass slaughter and to confront its leaders with the prospect of national annihilation\".\n\nAuthor Steven Poole said that the \"people killed by terrorism\" are not the targets of the intended terror effect. He said that the atomic bombings were \"designed as an awful demonstration\" aimed at Stalin and the government of Japan.\n\nAlexander Werth, historian and BBC Eastern Front war correspondent, suggests that the nuclear bombing of Japan mainly served to demonstrate the new weapon in the most shocking way, virtually at the Soviet Union's doorstep, in order to prepare the political post-war field.\n\nThe Vatican newspaper \"L'Osservatore Romano\" expressed regret in August 1945 that the bomb's inventors did not destroy the weapon for the benefit of humanity. Rev. Cuthbert Thicknesse, the Dean of St Albans, prohibited using St Albans Abbey for a thanksgiving service for the war's end, calling the use of atomic weapons \"an act of wholesale, indiscriminate massacre\". In 1946, a report by the Federal Council of Churches entitled \"Atomic Warfare and the Christian Faith\", includes the following passage:\n\nThe bombers' chaplain, Father George Benedict Zabelka, would later renounce the bombings after visiting Nagasaki with two fellow chaplains.\n\nAmerican historian Gabriel Kolko said certain discussion regarding the moral dimension of the attacks is wrong-headed, given the fundamental moral decision had already been made:\n\nDuring the war, and 1945 in particular, due to state secrecy, very little was known outside Japan about the slow progress of the Japanese nuclear weapon program. The US knew that Japan had requested materials from their German allies, and of unprocessed uranium oxide was dispatched to Japan in April 1945 aboard the submarine \"U-234\", which however surrendered to US forces in the Atlantic following Germany's surrender. The uranium oxide was reportedly labeled as \"U-235\", which may have been a mislabeling of the submarine's name; its exact characteristics remain unknown. Some sources believe that it was not weapons-grade material and was intended for use as a catalyst in the production of synthetic methanol to be used for aviation fuel.\n\nIf post-war analysis had found that Japanese nuclear weapons development was near completion, this discovery might have served in a revisionist sense to justify the atomic attack on Japan. However, it is known that the poorly coordinated Japanese project was considerably behind the US developments in 1945, and also behind the unsuccessful German nuclear energy project of WWII.\n\nA review in 1986 of the fringe hypothesis that Japan had \"already\" created a nuclear weapon, by Department of Energy employee Roger M. Anders, appeared in the journal \"Military Affairs\":\n\nThe second atomic bombing, on Nagasaki, came only three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, when the devastation at Hiroshima had yet to be fully comprehended by the Japanese. The lack of time between the bombings has led some historians to state that the second bombing was \"certainly unnecessary\", \"gratuitous at best and genocidal at worst\", and not \"jus in bello\". In response to the claim that the atomic bombing of Nagasaki was unnecessary, Maddox wrote:\n\nJerome Hagen indicates that War Minister Anami's revised briefing was partly based on interrogating captured American pilot Marcus McDilda. Under torture, McDilda reported that the Americans had 100 atomic bombs, and that Tokyo and Kyoto would be the next atomic bomb targets. Both were lies; McDilda was not involved or briefed on the Manhattan Project and simply told the Japanese what he thought they wanted to hear.\n\nOne day before the bombing of Nagasaki, the Emperor notified Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō of his desire to \"insure a prompt ending of hostilities\". Tōgō wrote in his memoir that the Emperor \"warned [him] that since we could no longer continue the struggle, now that a weapon of this devastating power was used against us, we should not let slip the opportunity [to end the war] by engaging in attempts to gain more favorable conditions\". The Emperor then requested Tōgō to communicate his wishes to the Prime Minister.\n\nHistorian James J. Weingartner sees a connection between the American mutilation of Japanese war dead and the bombings. According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. \"[T]he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands.\" On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: \"The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When you have to deal with a beast you have to treat him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true\".\n\nAt the time of the atomic bombings, there was no international treaty or instrument protecting a civilian population specifically from attack by aircraft. Many critics of the atomic bombings point to the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 as setting rules in place regarding the attack of civilian populations. The Hague Conventions contained no specific air warfare provisions but it prohibited the targeting of undefended civilians by naval artillery, field artillery, or siege engines, all of which were classified as \"bombardment\". However, the Conventions allowed the targeting of military establishments in cities, including military depots, industrial plants, and workshops which could be used for war. This set of rules was not followed during World War I which saw bombs dropped indiscriminately on cities by Zeppelins and multi-engine bombers. Afterward, another series of meetings were held at The Hague in 1922–23, but no binding agreement was reached regarding air warfare. During the 1930s and 1940s, the aerial bombing of cities was resumed, notably by the German Condor Legion against the cities of Guernica and Durango in Spain in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War. This led to an escalation of various cities bombed, including Chongqing, Warsaw, Rotterdam, London, Coventry, Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo. All of the major belligerents in World War II dropped bombs on civilians in cities.\n\nModern debate over the applicability of the Hague Conventions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki revolves around whether the Conventions can be assumed to cover modes of warfare that were at the time unknown; whether rules for artillery bombardment can be applied to rules for aerial bombing. As well, the debate hinges on to what degree the Hague Conventions was being followed by the warring countries.\n\nIf the Hague Conventions is admitted as applicable, the critical question becomes whether the bombed cities met the definition of \"undefended\". Some observers consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki undefended, some say that both cities were legitimate military targets, and others say that Hiroshima could be considered a legitimate military target while Nagasaki was comparatively undefended. Hiroshima has been argued as not a legitimate target because the major industrial plants were just outside the target area. It has also been argued as a legitimate target because Hiroshima was the headquarters of the regional Second General Army and Fifth Division with 40,000 combatants stationed in the city. Both cities were protected by anti-aircraft guns, which is an argument against the definition of \"undefended\".\n\nThe Hague Conventions prohibited poison weapons. The radioactivity of the atomic bombings has been described as poisonous, especially in the form of nuclear fallout which kills more slowly. However, this view was rejected by the International Court of Justice in 1996, which stated that the primary and exclusive use of (air burst) nuclear weapons is not to poison or asphyxiate and thus is not prohibited by the Geneva Protocol.\n\nThe Hague Conventions also prohibited the employment of \"arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering\". The Japanese government cited this prohibition on 10 August 1945 after submitting a letter of protest to the United States denouncing the use of atomic bombs. However, the prohibition only applied to weapons as lances with a barbed head, irregularly shaped bullets, projectiles filled with glass, the use of any substance on bullets that would tend unnecessarily to inflame a wound inflicted by them, along with grooving bullet tips or the creation of soft point bullets by filing off the ends of the hard coating on full metal jacketed bullets.\n\nIt however did not apply to the use of explosives contained in artillery projectiles, mines, aerial torpedoes, or hand grenades. In 1962 and in 1963, the Japanese government retracted its previous statement by saying that there was no international law prohibiting the use of atomic bombs.\n\nThe Hague Conventions stated that religious buildings, art and science centers, charities, hospitals, and historic monuments were to be spared as far as possible in a bombardment, unless they were being used for military purposes. Critics of the atomic bombings point to many of these kinds of structures which were destroyed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, the Hague Conventions also stated that for the destruction of the enemy's property to be justified, it must be \"imperatively demanded by the necessities of war\". Because of the inaccuracy of heavy bombers in World War II, it was not practical to target military assets in cities without damage to civilian targets.\n\nEven after the atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, no international treaty banning or condemning nuclear warfare has ever been ratified. The closest example is a resolution by the UN General Assembly which stated that nuclear warfare was not in keeping with the UN charter, passed in 1953 with a vote of 25 to 20, and 26 abstentions.\n\nVarying opinions exist on the question of what role the bombings played in Japan's surrender: some regard the bombings as the deciding factor, others see the bombs as a minor factor, and yet others assess their importance as unknowable.\n\nThe mainstream position in the United States from 1945 through the 1960s regarded the bombings as the decisive factor in ending the war; commentators have termed this the \"traditionalist\" view, or pejoratively the \"patriotic orthodoxy\".\n\nSome, on the other hand, see the Soviet invasion of Manchuria as primary or decisive. In the US, Robert Pape and Tsuyoshi Hasegawa in particular have advanced this view, which some have found convincing, but which others have criticized.\n\nRobert Pape also argues that:\n\nIn Japanese writing about the surrender, many accounts consider the Soviet entry into the war as the primary reason or as having equal importance with the atomic bombs, while others, such as the work of Sadao Asada, give primacy to the atomic bombings, particularly their impact on the emperor. The primacy of the Soviet entry as a reason for surrender is a long-standing view among some Japanese historians, and has appeared in some Japanese junior high school textbooks. Notably however, the Soviet Navy was well regarded as chronically lacking the naval capability to invade the home islands of Japan, despite having received numerous ships under loan from the US.\n\nThe argument about the Soviet role in Japan's surrender has a connection with the argument about the Soviet role in America's decision to drop the bomb: both arguments emphasize the importance of the Soviet Union. The former suggests that Japan surrendered to the US out of fear of the Soviet Union, and the latter emphasizes that the US dropped the bombs to intimidate the Soviet Union. Soviet accounts of the ending of the war emphasised the role of the Soviet Union. The \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" summarised events thus:\nIn August 1945 American military air forces dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima (6 August) and of Nagasaki (9 August). These bombings were not caused by military necessity, and served primarily political aims. They inflicted enormous damage on the peaceable population.\n\nFulfilling the obligations entered into by agreement with its allies and aiming for a very speedy ending of the second world war, the Soviet government on 8 August 1945 declared that from 9 August 1945 the USSR would be in a state of war against J[apan], and associated itself with the 1945 Potsdam declaration ... of the governments of the USA, Great Britain and China of 26 July 1945, which demanded the unconditional capitulation of J[apan] and foreshadowed the bases of its subsequent demilitarization and democratization. The attack by Soviet forces, smashing the Kwantung Army and liberating Manchuria, Northern Korea, Southern Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, led to the rapid conclusion of the war in the Far East. On 2 September 1945 J[apan] signed the act of unconditional capitulation.\n\nHowever contrary to the narrative presented by the Soviet Encyclopedia, Japan had already declared its surrender 3 days \"before\" the August 18th Soviet invasion of the Kuril Islands, where Soviet forces received comparatively little military opposition due to the earlier declaration of surrender.\n\nStill others have argued that war-weary Japan would likely have surrendered regardless, due to a collapse of the economy, lack of army, food, and industrial materials, threat of internal revolution, and talk of surrender since earlier in the year, while others find this unlikely, arguing that Japan may well have, or likely would have, put up a spirited resistance.\n\nThe Japanese historian Sadao Asada argues that the ultimate decision to surrender was a personal decision by the emperor, influenced by the atomic bombings.\n\nA further argument, discussed under the rubric of \"atomic diplomacy\" and advanced in a 1965 book of that name by Gar Alperovitz, is that the bombings had as primary purpose to intimidate the Soviet Union, being the opening shots of the Cold War. Along these lines some argue that the United States raced the Soviet Union and hoped to drop the bombs and receive surrender from Japan before a Soviet entry into the Pacific War.\nHowever, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom came to an agreement at the Yalta Conference on when the Soviet Union should join the war against Japan, and on how the territory of Japan was to be divided at the end of the war.\n\nOthers argue that such considerations played little or no role, the United States being instead concerned with the surrender of Japan, and in fact that the United States desired and appreciated the Soviet entry into the Pacific War, as it hastened the surrender of Japan. In his memoirs Truman wrote: \"There were many reasons for my going to Potsdam, but the most urgent, to my mind, was to get from Stalin a personal reaffirmation of Russia's entry into the war against Japan, a matter which our military chiefs were most anxious to clinch. This I was able to get from Stalin in the very first days of the conference.\"\n\nCampbell Craig and Fredrik Logevall argue the two bombs were dropped for different reasons:\n\nThe Pew Research Center conducted a 2015 survey showing that 56% of Americans support the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki from WWII, while only 34% oppose the bombings. The study highlighted the impact of the respondent’s generation, showing that 70% of Americans 65 and older support the bombings, while only 47% of 18- to 29-year-olds support the bombings. Younger generations of Americans are less supportive of the bombings, according to the Pew Research Center statistics. Political leanings also impacted responses according to the survey. 74% of Republicans support the bombings while 52% of Democrats support the bombings.American approval of the US dropping the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki has decreased steadily since 1945. A 1945 Gallup poll showed that 85% of Americans approved of using atomic weapons on Japanese cities, while only 10% disapproved. Forty five years later in 1990, Gallup conducted another poll and recorded 53% of Americans approving the bombings with 41% disapproving the bombings. Another 2005 Gallup poll echoes the findings of the 2015 Pew Research Center study by finding 57% of Americans approved the bombings while 38% disapproved. While the poll data from The Pew Research Center and Gallup show a stark drop in support for the bombings over the last half century, Stanford political scientists have conducted research supporting their hypothesis that US public support for the use of nuclear force would be just as high today as in 1945 if a similar yet contemporary real life scenario presented itself.\n\nIn a 2017 study conducted by political scientists Scott D. Sagan and Benjamin A. Valentino, it was found that 67% of Americans support the conventional strike with use of atomic force in a hypothetical situation that killed 100,000 Iranian civilians over the other hypothetical option of an invasion that would kill 20,000 American soldiers. On the other hand, a 2010 Pew survey showed that 64% of Americans approved of Barack Obama’s declaration of US abstinence of nuclear weapons against a nation that did not have them, showing that most Americans have a conflicted view on use of atomic force.\n\n\n"}

Over several decades beginning in the 1930s, Rosenthal made hundreds of sketches in charcoal and pastel depicting the everyday life and domestic activities of Indian and mestizo peasant culture, which she later used to create large-scale studio paintings. LIFE magazine featured Rosenthal’s art and travels in Mexico in a five-page spread in 1943.\n\nThe John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation awarded Rosenthal a fellowship in 1931 to do creative work in painting in Mexico, where she was to live for two years beginning in August 1931. Thereafter, she made yearly trips to the country residing in small villages during the summer months. The Guggenheim Foundation awarded her a second fellowship for further work in Mexico in 1936. Rosenthal moved permanently to Mexico in 1957, and died in the city of Oaxaca in 1971.\n\nRosenthal was born in Riverside, California, in 1889 into a prosperous Jewish family and raised on a ranch. Her father, Emil Julius Rosenthal, had settled in Riverside in 1872 from Müelhasen, Thüringen, Prussian (Germany), and married Anna Jane Unruh. Rosenthal launched her career as an artist in Los Angeles in the 1910s, when progressive trends were emerging in southern California art. Rosenthal was close to Helena Dunlap, the pioneer Los Angeles modernist and founder in 1916 of the Los Angeles Modern Art Society, one of the first modernist groups to form in the region.\n\nRosenthal and Dunlap traveled to Taos, New Mexico, in 1917. There, they briefly resided and exhibited alongside the leading American painters George Bellows, Robert Henri and others in the inaugural exhibition in Santa Fe’s new Fine Arts Museum. Rosenthal exhibited in the California Art Club spring exhibitions at the Los Angeles Museum in 1917 and 1919, showing \"Indian Women of Taos\" in 1917.\n\nRosenthal went to New York to study at the Art Students League with Bellows and John Sloan in 1917–1918, and attended classes in the studio of the broad-minded bohemian George Luks. In 1920, she worked as a commercial designer of silks in order to fund a trip to Europe.\n\nRosenthal studied first at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière in Paris, and then went on a sketching trip to Berlin, Rome, and Munich, staying throughout 1921 and 1922. Following her European tour, she married Charles “Jack” Charash, a press agent, theatrical manager, dramatist, and co-founder of the Anglo-Jewish Theatre, a unit of the WPA Federal Theatre Project.\n\nIn the late 1920s, Rosenthal published a series of portfolios featuring design motifs drawn from the art and artifacts of an international array of museum collections. The \"Prim-Art Series\" portfolios are arranged around themes such as transportation, costumes, and animal motifs. The series signaled her study of ethnographic or “primitive” art and culture and were instrumental in winning her two Guggenheim awards to work in Mexico. The portfolios helped introduce new aesthetics to design, and were acclaimed as useful resources for professional designers and as teaching tools for art instructors.\n\nRosenthal was a lifelong art instructor and educator, having earned a degree in teaching from Los Angeles State Teachers College in 1910, and Teachers College of Columbia University in 1913. She taught painting and drawing in Columbia University’s Teacher’s College from 1924 to 1931, and at James Monroe High School in the Bronx thereafter.\n\nDoris Rosenthal produced a large body of work over a six-decade career. Her Depression-era American Scene paintings focusing on Mexican life and culture were nationally respected and covered by major art publications and popular magazines such as \"LIFE\", \"Newsweek\", \"Harper’s Bazaar\", and the \"New Yorker\". She had the support of the eminent critics and historians Edward Alden Jewel, Lewis Mumford, and Carleton Beals; and the Midtown Galleries in New York handled her paintings and works on paper. Her work was included in important exhibitions such as \"American Painting Today\" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\n\nAccording to Mexican art critic Gulliermo Rivas: \"Doris Rosenthal is not striving to escape her work, but rather to go out and meet it.\" \n\n"}

Despite the name, and hosted by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the competition, a former member of European Union of Music Competitions for Youth, is designed for British percussion, keyboard, string, brass and woodwind players, all of whom must be eighteen years of age or under on 1 January in the relevant year.\n\nThe competition was established in 1978 by Humphrey Burton and Walter Todds, both of whom are former members of the BBC Television Music Department. Michael Hext, a trombonist, was the inaugural winner. In 1994, the usage of percussion instruments was first permitted, alongside the existing keyboard, string, brass and woodwind categories. The competition has five stages, which consist of regional auditions, category auditions, category finals, semi-finals and the final.\n\nThe Free Trade Hall in Peter Street, Manchester, England, was the host venue for the first edition of the Eurovision Young Musicians. The Italian palazzo-style hall was built on a trapeziform site in ashlar sandstone. It has a two-storey, nine-bay facade and concealed roof. On Peter Street, its ground floor arcade has rectangular piers with round-headed arches and spandrels bearing the coats of arms of Lancashire towns that took part in the Anti-Corn Law movement. The upper floor has a colonnaded arcade, its tympana frieze is richly decorated with carved figures representing free trade, the arts, commerce, manufacture and the continents. Above the tympanum is a prominent cornice with balustraded parapet. The upper floor has paired Ionic columns to each bay and a tall window with a pedimented architrave behind a balustraded balcony. The return sides have three bays in a matching but simpler style of blank arches. The rear wall was rebuilt in 1950–51 with pilasters surmounted by relief figures representing the entertainment which took place in the old hall. The Large Hall was in a classical style with a coffered ceiling, the walls had wood panelling in oak, walnut and sycamore.\nPevsner described it as \"the noblest monument in the Cinquecento style in England\", whilst Hartwell considered it \"a classic which belongs in the canon of historic English architecture.\"\n\nHumphrey Burton was the host of the inaugural contest, and welcomed representatives from six participating countries in English, French, and German. Each participating country were able to send male or female artists who were no older than 19 years of age, to represent them by playing an instrumental and a musical piece of their choice. They were all accompanied by the BBC Northern Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by Bryden Thomson. The winner received a cash prize of £1,000.\n\nAwards were given to the top three countries. The table below highlights these using \"gold, silver, and bronze\". The placing results of the remaining participants is unknown and never made public by the European Broadcasting Union.\n\nThe jury members consisted of the following:\n\nEBU members from the following countries broadcast the contest.\n\n"}
{"id": "536846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=536846", "title": "Excite", "text": "Excite\n\nExcite (stylized as excite) is an internet portal launched in December 1995 that provides a variety of content including news and weather, a metasearch engine, a web-based email, instant messaging, stock quotes, and a customizable user homepage. The content is collated from over 100 different sources.\n\nExcite's portal and services are owned by Excite Networks, but in the US, Excite is a personal portal, called My Excite, which is operated by Mindspark and owned by IAC Search and Media.\n\nIn the 1990s, Excite was one of the most recognized brands on the Internet, before its decline in the early 2000s.\n\nExcite search formerly obtained results from several other popular search engines, but now, like Yahoo!, it is powered by Bing.\n\nExcite was founded as \"Architext\" in 1994 by Graham Spencer, Joe Kraus, Mark VanHaren, Ryan McIntyre, Ben Lutch and Martin Reinfried, who were all students at Stanford University. In July 1994, International Data Group paid them US$80,000 to develop an online service. In January 1995, Vinod Khosla (a former Stanford student), a partner at the venture capital firm, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, arranged a US$250,000 \"first round\" backing for the project, with US$1.5 million provided over a ten-month period. Soon thereafter, Geoff Yang, of Institutional Venture Partners, introduced an additional US$1.5 million in financing and Excite was formally launched in December 1995. In January 1996, George Bell joined Excite as its Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Excite also purchased two search engines (Magellan and WebCrawler) and signed exclusive distribution agreements with Netscape, Microsoft and Apple, in addition to other companies. In 1994, Excite hired Jim Bellows, then 72, to figure out how to present the content in a journalistic manner. He paid good journalists to write brief reviews of web sites. However, users wanted to get directly to the content and skipped the reviews, so the partnership with Bellows ended in 1998.\n\nOn April 4, 1996, Excite went public with an initial offering of two million shares. In June 1997, Intuit, maker of Quicken and TurboTax, purchased a 19% stake in Excite and finalized a seven-year partnership deal. On October 16, 1997, Excite purchased Netbot, a comparison shopping agent. At the same time Intuit announced the launch of \"Excite Business & Investing\". Later that year a deal was finalized with Ticketmaster to provide direct online ticketing. On March 31, 1998, Excite reported a net loss of approximately $30.2 million and according to its first quarter report it had only enough available capital to meet obligations through December. In December 1998, Yahoo! was in negotiations to purchase Excite for $5.5 billion to $6 billion. However, prompted by Kleiner Perkins, @Home Network's Chairman and CEO, Thomas Jermoluk met with Excite's chairman and CEO George Bell on December 19, and Excite was subsequently acquired by @Home Network, on January 19, 1999.\n\nThe US$6.7 billion merger of Excite and @Home Network in 1999 became one of the largest mergers of two Internet companies at the time. @Home's high-speed Internet services and existing portal were combined with Excite's search engine and portal, with a move towards personalized web portal content following the merger. The new company was named \"Excite@Home\" (the stock symbol and the company's name in regulatory filing records remained as \"At Home Corporation\" (ATHM)) and, six months after the merger, Tom Jermoluk stepped down as CEO of Excite@Home. Excite's George Bell, who was the President of the Excite division of @Home after the merger, became the new CEO of the combined Excite@Home, whilst Jermoluk remained Chairman of the Board.\n\nFollowing the merger, the Excite division purchased iMall, as well as online greeting card company, Blue Mountain Arts. Excite also acquired photo sharing company Webshots. Excite furthermore paid for sponsorship of Infiniti Indy car driver Eddie Cheever, Jr., through the 2000 and 2001 racing seasons. However, the merger between Excite and @Home fell disastrously short of expectations. Online advertising revenue plummeted, while cable network ISP revenue continued to grow. On September 21, 2000, after stock value had dropped 90%, George Bell announced plans to step down as CEO within six months. On April 23, 2001, Excite@Home announced Patti S. Hart, the former CEO of Telocity, would become its third CEO in three years. In the same announcement, George Bell resigned and left the company completely. The company also reported first-quarter net loss of $61.6 million, compared with a loss of $4.6 million in the same period the prior year.\n\nOn June 11, 2001, Excite@Home announced that it had raised $100 million in financing from Promethean Capital Management and Angelo Gordon & Co. Part of the deal was that the loan was repayable immediately if Excite@Home stock was delisted by NASDAQ. The loan, structured as a note convertible into shares of Excite, had an interest rate of zero. By August 20 of that year, Excite@Home had replaced its auditors Ernst & Young with PricewaterhouseCoopers. This triggered a demand from Promethean Capital Management and Angelo Gordon & Co for the immediate repayment of $50 million in debt. Furthermore, Cox Cable and Comcast announced that they would separate from Excite@Home by the first quarter of 2002.\n\nOn September 13, 2001, Excite@Home sold Blue Mountain Arts to American Greetings for less than 5% of what it had paid less than two years earlier. On October 1, 2001, Excite@Home filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California. The company's remaining 1,350 employees were laid off over the following months. As part of the agreement, @Home's national high-speed fiber network access would be sold back to AT&T Corporation. @Home Liquidating Trust became the successor company to Excite@Home, charged with the sale of all assets of the former company.\n\nAt the end of 2001, the Webshots assets were purchased by the company's founders for $2.4 million in cash from the Bankruptcy Court.\n\nDuring the collapse of Excite@Home, iWon.com, an Irvington, New York–based venture, had surreptitiously commenced the design of a new Excite website; iWon.com planned to acquire the Excite.com domain name and brand in the course of the bankruptcy proceedings. IWon.com eventually made a joint bid with Seattle's InfoSpace to purchase the domain name and brand. On November 28, 2001, the court accepted the bid and gave iWon less than three weeks to launch a new Excite portal. Bill Daugherty, iWon's founder and co-chief executive at the time, told \"The New York Times\", \"I feel like a guy who lived through a hurricane, got pounded and pounded and managed to survive when everyone else was destroyed. Suddenly you walk outside and because of the storm you have beachfront property. That's what Excite is to us.\"\n\nOn December 16, 2001, iWon launched the new Excite portal and transferred millions of Excite users to its new home. iWon changed its corporate name to \"Excite Network\", and continued to operate Excite, iWon, and a third portal, MyWay. Outside of the United States, Excite Italia took control of portals in UK, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, and Austria. Infospace, for its part, owned and operated the web search function on Excite. This proved to be a short-sighted arrangement as searching became big business on the Internet in the ensuing years.\n\nExcite continued to operate until the Excite Network was acquired by Ask Jeeves (now Ask.com) in March 2004. Ask Jeeves promised to rejuvenate iWon and Excite, but did not. Ask Jeeves management became distracted, according to the \"East Bay Business Times\", first by a search feature arms race with Google and Yahoo!, and then by its merger with Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp, announced in March 2005. \"Hopefully, as we start to invest more and get the staff in place and some of the changes to the portal properties that we want, we hope to see (revenue) grow back in the latter half of the year,\" said Ask Jeeves CEO Steve Berkowitz during a conference call with analysts on April 27, 2005.\n\nOn May 20, 2005, Ask Jeeves made two announcements regarding the rejuvenation of the Excite brand. It first announced that it had acquired Excite Italia B.V. (the operator of Excite Europe), from Tiscali, S.p.A.; and, secondly, the company reported that it had reached a comprehensive settlement with InfoSpace regarding Excite in the United States, whereby Ask Jeeves and InfoSpace would share marketing costs and revenue from the Excite web search function. Regarding the acquisition, Ask Jeeves CEO, Steve Berkowitz, said, \"We look forward to working with InfoSpace to enhance the search experience on Excite, now that our interests are aligned.\" On October 17, 2007, GOADV, a media company specializing in the generation of Internet \"traffic\", announced the completion of its acquisition of the European Excite group of companies.\n\nIn a bid to compete against Internet Service Providers like NetZero and Juno Online, which offered free or low-cost dial-up access in the United States, Excite started offering its own \"no-pay\" service for private customers by partnering with 1stUp.com to create FreeLane by Excite: 1stUp would allow Excite customers to download software in order for them to be able to log-on to the Internet. The software would then rotate a series of sponsored banner advertisements on the user's computer while they surfed the Internet. 1stUp.com soon went out of business, and Excite switched to another partner named WorldShare, rebranding FreeLane as FreeLane version 2.0. As of March 1, 2001 FreeLane was discontinued.\n\nExcite.com features a number of domains that cater to different services. Their events portal is essentially a ticket selling website where users can buy tickets and search through thousands of events and venues. The powerful search engine capabilities of the Excite server are utilized on this website to help the user search for tickets and events.\n\nRecently Excite.com has also started an education portal that can be used by people to search for and apply for different degrees and online courses. The Excite Education portal features a list of thousands of educational institutes across America for prospective students to browse through and apply at.\n\nLocal Excite websites:\n\nThe United States version does not apply as it became a personal portal, called \"My Excite\".\n\n\n"}

The report showed footage of lava flowing down a hillside (taken from the March 27 eruption of Mount St. Helens) and edited remarks from President Jimmy Carter (who expressed concern) and Governor Edward J. King (who called the situation \"serious\"). According to reporter Jan Harrison, the disaster had been caused by a geological chain reaction set off by the eruption of Mount St. Helens a week earlier. At the end of the bulletin, Harrison held up a card that read \"April Fool\".\n\nFollowing the report, some Milton residents began to flee their homes. The Milton Police Department received over a hundred calls from people who believed that the report was true. The Massachusetts Department of Civil Defense was also inundated with calls from residents who wanted to know if they should evacuate their homes.\n\nWNAC-TV received dozens of calls from angry viewers. The station issued an apology during its 11 pm newscast. The next day, the executive producer of the 6 o'clock news, Homer Cilley, was fired by the station for \"his failure to exercise good news judgment\" and for violating the Federal Communications Commission's rules about showing stock footage without identifying it as such.\n\n"}

Kennedy.\n\nNichols was a graduate of the Southern Methodist University Law School, class of 1940. He was a lawyer in Dallas for over 60 years, practicing Civil Law. Nichols was a member of the American Bar Association; Texas Bar Association and other legal associations.

Oswald was being questioned at the time with regards to the assassination of President Kennedy as well as the shooting of Dallas Police officer J. D. Tippit. Law school deans were contacting the Dallas Bar Association expressing concern that \"only a legal backwater would deny an attorney to a murder suspect\".\n\nNichols, who practiced civil law in the Dallas area was the president of the Dallas Bar Association at the time. In 1963, criminal suspects in Texas had no right to a lawyer while being questioned. However, Nichols was concerned and believed that Oswald needed legal representation, despite the fact that it was clear Oswald was unable to pay for an attorney to represent him. He decided to go to the Dallas Police Department and offer his services, despite the fact he was unfamiliar with criminal law.\n\nUpon arrival at the Police Department, he announced to police officials he was an attorney and was there to speak to Oswald. He was accompanied to Oswald's cell, where he found him sitting by himself between two empty adjacent cells, with a police officer just outside the door of the cell. Oswald was calm and rested in the cell with a bruise over one eye. He stated that the police were holding him \"incommunicado\" and denied killing either Kennedy or Officer Tippit.\n\nOswald stated to Nichols that he wanted John Abt, an attorney from New York to represent him. Abt was associated with the American Civil Liberties Union. Nichols asked Oswald if he wanted him or a Dallas lawyer to represent him. Oswald stated \"No, not right now.\"\n\nNichols then left Oswald to be alone in his cell and departed from the Dallas Police station. Nichols' visit with Oswald lasted approximately two minutes.

In 1571 \"Pozzogottesi\" obtained from the Grand Court of the Archbishop of Messina permission to elect their chaplain stationed in Saint Vitus no longer depend from the Archpriest of Milazzo. The first procession is carried out in 1621 as a movement of protest against the Jurors of the city of Milazzo, under whose jurisdiction Pozzo di Gotto depended politically and physically by providing a distant village and as a vow and promise to break the bond of subordination constraint which will be permanently discontinued on the 22 of May 1639. Initially it is carried in procession the \"Catafalco with the Dead Christ\", after 5 will be the statues that depict respectively Mysteries: the \"Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane\", the \"Lord to the column\", the \"Fall\", the \"Lord's Cross\", the \"Urn\". Then will be added the statue of \"Our\" and gradually, other scenes representing the Stations of the Cross until you reach the current number. A first suspension of the Sacred Representation occurs following a seismic event, known as the southern Calabria Earthquake of 1783, after which the statuary groups suffered significant damage. The interruption is prolonged until 1800, and in 1801 a similar procession is organized in the core of Barcellona. The village to the west of Longano in turn under the jurisdiction of Castroreale and had already followed the example of the neighboring community rebelling against Jurors castrensian doing in the Church recognize their independence. The autonomy of the village of Barcellona is decided by the Sicilian Parliament, recognized by the King 15 May 1815 and ratified in Vienna on February 28, 1823 by King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies. The administrative union decreed January 5, 1835 comes into force on the 1 st. June 1836 at the behest of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, deciding that the new municipality formed by the merger of the two ancient districts bore the full name of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto. Since Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto has two Archpriests and boasts the occasion of Holy Friday two separate processions, parades and routes. During the Crimean War broke out in 1854 in Europe a violent epidemic cholera which soon transcends the boundaries of Alps and upsets the whole of the peninsula, reaching rates high mortality in the provinces of Messina and Palermo. Even on this occasion, the celebrations are not made for fear of infections due to numerous outbreaks.\n\nSpanish flu remain clear even footprints in the etymological definition: from the Spanish \"Semana Santa\" to the local \" Santa Sumana\". Not the baroque splendor of the Holy Week in Seville or Málaga or Cordoba or Granada, not the incessant processional marches always clearly of Iberian Trapani or Caltanissetta, but one of the prettiest and for number of simulacra, certainly the most rich and varied.\n\n\nIn similar events is still in use Cataletto or Catafalco with Dead Christ, often veiled in the colors of mourning. In the representations of the Holy Week rites of Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto, in both the processions Catafalco is replaced with urns or coffins of wood and glass, from which the etymology \"Bara\" and \"Baretta.\"\nThe terms \"vara\", \"Varetta\" and \"varare\" are derived from Latin and Spanish that means to lead, carry with rods or shafts, promoting sustainable through the use of stands. The transport and the stops along the processional route followed the trend of the times: the long poles for carrying on the shoulder carried by porters and trestles were replaced with more comfortable wagons, which have kept only the rods for directing or entrainment of simulacra.\n"}

It is one of Kyoto's renowned three great festivals, with the other two being the \"Aoi Matsuri\", held annually on May 15, and the \"Gion Matsuri\", which is held annually from 17 to July 24. It is a festival enjoyed by people of all ages, participating in its historical reenactment parade dressed in authentic costumes representing various periods, and characters in Japanese feudal history.\n\nJidai Matsuri traces its roots to the relocation of the Japanese capital from Kyoto to Tokyo during the Meiji Restoration in 1868. This involved the relocation of the Emperor of Japan and the Imperial family, the Imperial Palace, and thousands of government officials and subjects to the new city. Fearing for Kyoto's loss of glory and interest from her people, and to commemorate its history, the city government and the Kyoto prefectural government commemorated the 1100th anniversary of the founding of Heian-kyō (平安京), which was the former name of Kyoto, in 794 by (737–806). To inaugurate the first Jidai celebration in 1895, the city government built the to enshrine the spirit of Emperor Kanmu. To add meaning to the festival, it staged a costume procession representing people of each era in Kyoto history. In 1940, the local government decided that on top of honouring Emperor Kanmu, the Jidai festival was also to be held in honour of (July 22, 1831 – January 30, 1867) for his work in unifying the country, the power of the imperial court and the affirmation of Kyoto as the center of Japan at the decline of the Tokugawa shogunate and the end of the Edo period.\n\nThe Jidai Matsuri begins in early morning with the mikoshi (portable shrines) brought out of the Kyoto Imperial Palace so that people may pay their respects. The mikoshi represents both Emperor Kanmu and Emperor Kōmei. The five-hour, two-kilometer costume procession begins in the afternoon, with approximately 2,000 performers dressed as samurai, military figures, and common people, from the earliest eras to the Meiji era. These are followed by Japanese women who are dressed in elaborate . Finally, the mikoshi are carried from the palace and are accompanied by a costumed military band that plays the gagaku.

{"id": "86868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=86868", "title": "Joseph Kittinger", "text": "Joseph Kittinger\n\nJoseph William Kittinger II (born July 27, 1928) is a retired colonel in the United States Air Force and a USAF Command Pilot. Following his initial operational assignment in fighter aircraft, he participated in Project Manhigh and Project Excelsior in 1960, setting a world record for the highest skydive from a height greater than . He was also the first man to make a solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean in a gas balloon, and the first man to fully witness the curvature of the Earth.\n\nServing as a fighter pilot during the Vietnam War, he achieved an aerial kill of a North Vietnamese MiG-21 jet fighter and was later shot down himself, spending 11 months as a prisoner of war in a North Vietnamese prison.\n\nIn 2012, at the age of 84, he participated in the Red Bull Stratos project as capsule communicator, directing Felix Baumgartner on his record-breaking freefall from Earth's stratosphere, exceeding Kittinger's earlier freefall in 1960.\n\nBorn in Tampa, Florida, and raised in Orlando, Florida, Kittinger was educated at The Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida, and the University of Florida. He became fascinated with planes at a very young age and soloed in a Piper Cub by the time he was 17. After racing speedboats as a teenager, he entered the U.S. Air Force as an aviation cadet in March 1949. On completion of aviation cadet training in March 1950, he received his pilot wings and a commission as a second lieutenant. He was subsequently assigned to the 86th Fighter-Bomber Wing based at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany, flying the F-84 Thunderjet and F-86 Sabre.\n\nIn 1954 Kittinger was transferred to the Air Force Missile Development Center (AFMDC) at Holloman AFB, New Mexico. It was during this assignment that he flew the observation/chase plane that monitored flight surgeon Colonel John Stapp's rocket sled run of in 1955. Kittinger was impressed by Stapp's dedication and leadership as a pioneer in aerospace medicine. Stapp, in turn, was impressed with Kittinger's skillful jet piloting, later recommending him for space-related aviation research work. Stapp was to foster the high-altitude balloon tests that would later lead to Kittinger's record-setting leap from over . In 1957, as part of \"Project Manhigh\", Kittinger set an interim balloon altitude record of in \"Manhigh I\", for which he was awarded his first Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nCaptain Kittinger was next assigned to the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratories at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. For \"Project Excelsior\" (meaning \"ever upward\"), a name given to the project by Colonel Stapp as part of research into high-altitude bailouts, he made a series of three extreme altitude parachute jumps from an open gondola carried aloft by large helium balloons. These jumps were made in a \"rocking-chair\" position, descending on his back, rather than in the usual face-down position familiar to skydivers. This was because he was wearing a \"kit\" on his behind, and his pressure suit naturally formed a sitting shape when it was inflated, a shape appropriate for sitting in an airplane cockpit.\n\n\"Excelsior I\": Kittinger's first high-altitude jump, from about on November 16, 1959, was a near-disaster when an equipment malfunction caused him to lose consciousness. The automatic parachute opener in his equipment saved his life. He went into a flat spin at a rotational velocity of about 120 rpm, the g-forces at his extremities having been calculated to be over 22 times the force of gravity, setting another record.\n\n\"Excelsior II\": On December 11, 1959, Kittinger jumped again from about . For this leap, he was awarded the A. Leo Stevens Parachute Medal.\n\n\"Excelsior III\": On August 16, 1960, Kittinger made the final high-altitude jump at . Towing a small drogue parachute for initial stabilization, he fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds, reaching a maximum speed of before opening his parachute at . Incurring yet another equipment malfunction, the pressurization for his right glove malfunctioned during the ascent and his right hand swelled to twice its normal size, but he rode the balloon up to 102,800 feet before stepping off.\n\nOf the jumps from \"Excelsior\", Kittinger said:\n\nThere's no way you can visualize the speed. There's nothing you can see to see how fast you're going. You have no depth perception. If you're in a car driving down the road and you close your eyes, you have no idea what your speed is. It's the same thing if you're free falling from space. There are no signposts. You know you are going very fast, but you don't feel it. You don't have a 614-mph wind blowing on you. I could only hear myself breathing in the helmet.\n\nKittinger set historical numbers for highest balloon ascent, highest parachute jump, longest duration drogue-fall (four minutes), and fastest speed by a human being through the atmosphere. These were the USAF records, but were not submitted for aerospace world records to the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI). Kittinger's record for the highest ascent was broken in 1961 by Malcolm Ross and Victor Prather. His records for highest parachute jump and fastest velocity stood for 52 years, until they were broken in 2012 by Felix Baumgartner.\nFor this series of jumps, Kittinger was profiled in \"Life\" magazine and the \"National Geographic Magazine\", decorated with a second Distinguished Flying Cross, and awarded the Harmon Trophy by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nBack at Holloman Air Force Base, Kittinger took part in \"Project Stargazer\" on December 13–14, 1960. He and the astronomer William C. White took an open-gondola helium balloon packed with scientific equipment to an altitude of about , where they spent over 18 hours performing astronomical observations.\n\nIn 1965, after returning to the operational Air Force, Kittinger was approached by civilian amateur parachutist Nick Piantanida for assistance on Pintandia's \"Strato Jump\" project, an effort to break the previous freefall records of both Kittinger and Soviet Air Force officer Yevgeni Andreyev. Kittinger refused to participate in the effort, believing Piantanida's approach to the project was too reckless. Piantanida was subsequently killed in 1966 during his \"Strato Jump III\" attempt.\n\nKittinger later served three combat tours of duty during the Vietnam War, flying a total of 483 combat missions. During his first two tours he flew as an aircraft commander in Douglas A-26 Invaders and modified On Mark Engineering B-26K Counter-Invaders as part of Operations Farm Gate and Big Eagle.\n\nFollowing his first two Vietnam tours, he returned to the United States and soon transitioned to the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. During a voluntary third tour of duty to Vietnam in 1971–72, he commanded the 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron (555 TFS), the noted \"Triple Nickel\" squadron, flying the F-4D Phantom II. During this period he was credited with shooting down a North Vietnamese MiG-21 while flying an F-4D, USAF Serial No. 66-7463, with his WSO, 1st Lieutenant Leigh Hodgdon.\n\nKittinger was shot down on May 11, 1972, just before the end of his third tour of duty. While flying an F-4D, USAF Serial No. 66-0230, with his weapons systems officer, 1st Lieutenant William J. Reich, Lieutenant Colonel Kittinger was leading a flight of Phantoms approximately five miles northwest of Thai Nguyen, North Vietnam, when they were engaged by a flight of enemy MiG-21 fighters. Kittinger and his wingman were chasing a MiG-21 when Kittinger's Phantom II was hit by an air-to-air missile from another MiG-21 that damaged the Phantom's starboard wing and set the aircraft on fire. Kittinger and Reich ejected a few miles from Thai Nguyen and were soon captured and taken to the city of Hanoi. During the same engagement, Kittinger's wingman, Captain S. E. Nichols, shot down the MiG-21 they had been chasing.\n\nKittinger and Reich spent 11 months as prisoners of war (POWs) in the Hỏa Lò Prison, the so-called \"Hanoi Hilton\". Kittinger was put through rope torture soon after his arrival at the POW compound and this made a lasting impression on him. Kittinger was the senior ranking officer (SRO) among the newer prisoners of war, \"i.e.\", those captured after 1969. In Kittinger's autobiography \"Come Up and Get Me\" (by Kittinger and Craig Ryan), Kittinger emphasized being very serious about maintaining the military structure he considered essential to survival. Kittinger and Reich were returned to American hands on March 28, 1973, and they continued their Air Force careers, with Kittinger having been promoted to full colonel while in captivity. Following his return, Colonel Kittinger attended the Air War College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama.\n\nFollowing completion of the Air War College, Kittinger became the vice commander of the 48th Tactical Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, United Kingdom, where he again flew the F-4 Phantom II. In 1977, he transferred to Headquarters, 12th Air Force, at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, retiring from the Air Force in 1978. Kittinger accumulated 7,679 flying hours in the Air Force, including 948 combat flying hours during three tours during the Vietnam War. In addition, he has flown over 9,100 hours in various civilian aircraft.\n\nKittinger received the following awards and decorations during his USAF career:\n\nKittinger retired from the Air Force as a Colonel in 1978 and initially went to work for Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin) Corporation in Orlando, Florida. He later became Vice President of Flight Operations for Rosie O'Grady's Flying Circus, part of the Rosie O'Grady's/Church Street Station entertainment complex in Orlando, prior to the parent company's dissolution.\n\nStill interested in ballooning, he set a gas balloon world distance record for the AA-06 size class (since broken) of 3,221.23 km in 1983. He then completed the first solo balloon crossing of the Atlantic in the 106,000 cubic foot (3,000 m³) \"Balloon of Peace\", from September 14 to September 18, 1984 organized by the Canadian promoter Gaetan Croteau. As an official FAI world aerospace record, it is the longest gas balloon distance flight ever recorded in the AA-10 size category (5,703.03 km). For the second time in his life, he was also the subject of a story in National Geographic Magazine.\n\nKittinger also participated in the Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning in 1989 (ranked third) and 1994 (ranked 12th).\n\nIn the early 1990s, Kittinger played a lead role with NASA assisting Charles \"Nish\" Bruce to break his highest parachute jump record. The project was suspended in 1994.\n\nJoining the Red Bull Stratos project, Kittinger advised Felix Baumgartner on Baumgartner's October 14, 2012 free-fall from 128,100 feet (39,045m). The project collected leading experts in the fields of aeronautics, medicine and engineering to ensure its success. Kittinger eventually served as CAPCOM (capsule communicator) for Baumgartner's jump, which exceeded the altitude of Kittinger's previous jump during Project Excelsior.\n\nAs of 2013, Kittinger has been assisting balloonist Jonathan Trappe's attempt to be the first to cross the Atlantic by cluster balloon.\n\nIn 1997, Kittinger was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nOn January 23, 2007, the Civil Air Patrol honored Kittinger by renaming the Texas CAP wing's TX-352 Squadron after him. Texas Governor Rick Perry cited Kittinger's work, as did the Texas state senate with a special resolution presented during the dedication ceremony attended by Kittinger and his wife, Sherry. The Colonel Joseph W. Kittinger Phantom Senior Squadron of CAP's Texas Wing is based at the former Bergstrom AFB, the site of Kittinger's last active duty assignment in the Air Force and which is now the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport.\n\nKittinger was honored at a 2009 ceremony in Caribou, Maine, the launch point for his 1984 solo Trans-Atlantic balloon flight. He also served as the guest of honor at the community's sesquicentennial celebration.\n\nOn February 20, 2013, Kittinger visited his \"alma mater\", the University of Florida, and spoke to over 400 students and faculty about his role in the Red Bull Stratos Mission. Kittinger, a UF alumnus, told his story of when he took the 102,800-foot jump from a high-altitude balloon. This event took place during the UF Engineers Week, and it was made possible due to the efforts of the UF American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, UF Air Force ROTC, and the UF College of Engineering.\n\nIn September 1992, Colonel Joe Kittinger Park in Orlando, Florida was completed by the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority (GOAA) for the City of Orlando. Located on the southwest corner of the Orlando Executive Airport, at the corner of Crystal Lake Drive and South Street, the park was named in Kittinger's honor, but was temporarily closed and partially demolished circa 2008-2011 in order to create a stormwater runoff retention area to permit a highway expansion project of the State Road 408 East-West Expressway. In March 2011, the park was reopened at its previous location.\n\nIn Spring 2014, the Mayor of Orange County, the Mayor of Orlando, the GOAA Board, and other City of Orlando and GOAA officials approved inclusion in the park of a restored USAF F-4 Phantom II aircraft. The National Museum of the U.S. Air Force identified an F-4D previously on display in Corsicana, Texas, AF Ser. No. 65-0747, for transfer to Orlando, said aircraft to be placed on display at the park, and painted with the colors and markings of the squadron that Colonel Kittinger commanded during the Vietnam War. During the transfer process, it was subsequently determined that Colonel Kittinger had also flown this particular F-4D, AF Ser. No. 65-0747, on several occasions when it was assigned to his fighter wing in Thailand during the Vietnam War, and again when it was assigned to his fighter wing in Great Britain after the war. Disassembled in Texas and transported via two semi-trailers over a period of several days, the aircraft arrived in Orlando on July 22, 2014 and underwent a total restoration by a team of volunteers at Orlando Executive Airport. Following restoration, it was subsequently moved to its current location on the airport, remounted on its new pylon, and formally dedicated on December 14, 2014.\n\n\n\n \n \n"}

A wartime navigator in the Royal Air Force's Bomber Command, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1945 and presented BBC Television's \"The Sky at Night\" programme from 1957 until his death. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1968. Above all, Moore had a high level of public recognition in the United Kingdom as a respected astronomer.\n\nThe planet Jupiter is two and a half times as massive as all of the other planets in the Solar System combined.\n\nPluto is so small and so remote from the Sun and the Earth that it was not discovered until 1930. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union reclassified it as a dwarf planet, as it belongs to a belt of many similar small objects.\n\nOn 1 April 1976, Moore stated to radio listeners that an astronomical event would take place at 9:47 a.m. that day, a conjunction of Jupiter and Pluto, which was expected to have an effect observable everywhere. As Pluto passed behind Jupiter, it would briefly cause a powerful combination of the two planets' gravitational forces which would noticeably decrease gravity on Earth. If listeners were to jump into the air at that exact moment, they would find they felt a floating sensation.\n\nSoon after 9:47 on that morning, the BBC began to receive hundreds of telephone calls from people reporting they had observed the decrease in gravity. One woman who called in even stated that she and eleven friends had been sitting and had been \"wafted from their chairs and orbited gently around the room\".\n\nThe story was quickly revealed as an April Fools' Day hoax. Martin Wainwright later wrote in \"The Guardian\" that Moore was \"an ideal presenter\" to carry off the hoax, with his weighty delivery having \"an added air of batty enthusiasm that only added to his credibility\".\n\nIn 1980, Moore collaborated with Clyde Tombaugh, the man who had discovered Pluto in 1930, to publish a new book about the dwarf planet.\n\nThe hoax claims that the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Pluto combined will cause one to spend a significantly longer amount of time in the air due to an increase in gravitational pull from the distant planets; however, this is incorrect. Although other planets do exert a gravitational pull on humans on Earth, the amount is very small.\n\nAlthough Jupiter is very massive, it is also very far away. When at its closest distance to Earth of about 600 million kilometers, Jupiter has a gravitational pull of 0.00013 newtons on a person with a mass of 100 kg, according to Newton's law of gravity. About 7.5 million times weaker than the Earth's gravity, this is roughly equivalent to the gravitational attraction of a compact car from half a meter away. Similarly, the gravitational pull of the dwarf planet Pluto on a person on Earth is roughly equal to that of a marble 100 meters away. Thus, the gravitational impact of the planets is far too small to be able to cause a person to weigh noticeably less, or stay in the air noticeably longer when jumping.\n\n\n\n"}

Tauber's contract with the Berlin State Opera required him to be in Stockholm at the time of the Vienna premiere. The operetta was so coolly received in Vienna that the Berlin impresario, Heinz Saltenberg, was reluctant to mount it at the without guarantees against losses. In the event, Tauber and Schwarz made it a huge success in Berlin, where it ran for three months. It was the first Lehár operetta specially written for Tauber, who had previously appeared in the composer's \"Zigeunerliebe\" in 1920 and \"\" in 1922 with great success. A new production was mounted in Berlin at the Theater des Westens in April 1930, again with Tauber and Schwarz, and the composer conducting at the opening night on Easter Sunday.\n\nAn English version with lyrics by A.

{"id": "39261657", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39261657", "title": "Princess Doe", "text": "Princess Doe\n\nPrincess Doe is the name given to an unidentified American homicide victim found in Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown, New Jersey on July 15, 1982. The victim was a young white female between the ages of 15 and 20, although she has also been stated to be as young as 14. Her face had been bludgeoned beyond recognition. The approximate height of the victim was 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm) and her weight was 110 lbs (50 kg). She was the first unidentified decedent to be entered in the National Crime Information Center.\n\nCurrently, Princess Doe still remains unidentified. No arrests were ever made in the case, although a married couple have claimed responsibility for the victim's death. The Warren County Prosecutor's Office is the law enforcement agency investigating the case and still considers the case active. The body was buried in the Cedar Ridge Cemetery, not far from where she was discovered, in January 1983. The remains of Princess Doe were exhumed in 1999 so that samples could be collected for DNA testing, which was extracted from her femur in Baltimore, Maryland. The body was reburied in the same grave.\n\nOn the morning of July 15, 1982, gravedigger George Kise discovered the body of Princess Doe in the rear of Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown, New Jersey. The body was found lying on its back just over a steep bank that leads to a creek below. The victim's face had been beaten beyond recognition with a yet-to-be-determined object. Due to the condition of her body, her eye color could not be discerned.\n\nThe body was clad in a red short-sleeved shirt. A peasant-style skirt was found lying on top of the victim's legs. No undergarments were found. Despite this, no conclusive evidence of sexual assault was found, but this was difficult to determine because of the exposure of the body. A golden cross necklace was found tangled in the victim's hair. Two earrings were found in her left ear. Red nail polish was found on the right hand only and she had no known surgical scars, distinct birth marks or tattoos. Scars or marks on the head/face area would not be known due to the condition of the body. The front two teeth were slightly darker than the other teeth. The victim's appendix and tonsils were intact. Forensic anthropologists determined that the victim was not pregnant and had never given birth, and was most likely between the ages of 14 and 18 years old at the time of death. Toxicology did not reveal any traces of drugs but was not entirely conclusive because of the time lapse between the death and discovery of the body. It is believed that the body was discovered after two to three days or possibly weeks of exposure. This was difficult to determine because of the hot and humid weather in the area at the time.\n\nExamination indicated that the girl had attempted to fight back or defend from her attacker, as trauma to her hands and arms was observed.\n\nFor many years, Princess Doe was thought to be Diane Genice Dye, a missing teenager from San Jose, California, who vanished on July 30, 1979. This theory was propagated by several law enforcement officials in the state of New Jersey, who went as far as to hold a press conference identifying Diane Dye as Princess Doe. However, Lt. Eric Kranz, the Princess Doe case's original lead investigator, maintained that Diane Dye was not a viable candidate for Princess Doe's identity. Kranz's feelings were shared by Diane's family and investigators in California, who were particularly incensed by the conduct of New Jersey law enforcement. In 2003, Princess Doe's DNA was compared with a DNA sample from Diane's mother Patricia, and it was conclusively determined that the Princess Doe was not Diane Dye.\n\nIn 1999, evidence came to light that Arthur and Donna Kinlaw were responsible for Princess Doe's murder. Donna was arrested in California for attempting to commit welfare fraud by using the name \"Elaina\", which was traced to a Long Island native. When the police questioned her, she gave them details about the murder of \"Linda\" and her testimony put the Kinlaws behind bars; Donna gave details about two murders Arthur had committed, of two other females who remain unidentified today. After Arthur was faced with a death sentence, Donna told authorities that Kinlaw had killed another woman, a prostitute, earlier in 1982. She told police that she was with Arthur in the cemetery and witnessed him commit the murder. Another report states that Donna Kinlaw said that in July 1982, her husband brought home a teenage girl, left home and returned without her. He later apparently disposed of his clothing and cleaned his vehicle. Afterward, he threatened his wife, claiming if she did not attend her job, he would \"take her life\" as he did to the girl he brought home. However, a lack of corroboration meant that Arthur Kinlaw was not charged. Speirs stated that Kinlaw \"claimed responsibility for her death. But I have no physical evidence to confirm that, and without the identity of Princess Doe, I have no way of connecting the dots so to speak, putting her in a place where he could have been or would have been at the same time.\" Spears also reported that he doubted the confession because the Kinlaws could not provide a name for Princess Doe, even though they had claimed to have been with her for a period of time. Despite that he questions the credibility of their statements, Spears does believe the victim was native to Long Island, New York. However, Donna Kinlaw was interviewed by a forensic artist who created a sketch of the girl she claimed to have met, which does resemble the most recent composite. Arthur Kinlaw remains incarcerated for two counts of second-degree murder.\n\nApart from the Kinlaws, several other suspects have been reconsidered to be involved in the case.\n\nOne theory was submitted that Princess Doe may have been a runaway and could have been an individual using false names while employed at a hotel in Ocean City, Maryland. Six people have recently come forward with suspected identities of Princess Doe. In 2012, a sample of her hair and a tooth were examined through isotope analysis and indicated that the victim was most likely born in the United States. The sample of her hair indicated that she had lived at least seven to ten months in the Midwestern or Northeastern United States. The tooth sample indicated she could possibly be from Arizona. It is also believed that the girl had spent a long period of time in Long Island, New York. After seeing images of the girl's clothing on a newspaper, a woman reported to officials that she remembered seeing a girl wearing the same clothing as Princess Doe on July 13, 1982, just two days before her body was found. The woman claimed that she was shopping with her daughter at a store across from the cemetery and observed the victim's unique clothing. The shirt and skirt themselves were traced to a manufacturer in the Midwestern United States, although the brand labels were missing. Three people reported that they bought similar clothes, after viewing photos, at a Long Island store, which is now closed. It is unknown if the store was specifically located in Long Island or possibly in other locations. The 2012 composite of the victim also generated new tips, as it resembled several missing girls from the country.\n\nAfter extensive print media coverage in 1982, Lt. Eric Kranz, the original lead investigator from the Blairstown Police Department, was contacted by HBO regarding the Princess Doe case, and asked if the channel could chronicle the case in an upcoming documentary, entitled \"MISSING\". Kranz agreed, and the segment was filmed over the course of several weeks. Kranz was shown following leads as they came in, and the documentary was notable for containing actual footage of the recovery of Princess Doe's body, along with footage shot by HBO of Princess Doe's 1983 funeral. The documentary also contained a segment following the Johnny Gosch disappearance.\n\nLt. Kranz, now retired, coined the name, \"Princess Doe\" early in the investigation and also managed to get the case covered extensively in the media. The case was used as the impetus for recording unidentified crime victims in the NCIC database at the national level. Princess Doe became the first such case entered by the FBI director.\n\nA season one episode of \"MTV's Fear\", a paranormal reality television show, featured a completely fictionalized account of the Princess Doe murder. In the episode, airing in 2000, Princess Doe was portrayed as the victim of a cult sacrifice. Viewers were told that Princess Doe was found decapitated and missing her hands on the grounds of \"Camp Spirit Lake\", a fictionalized version of Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco, which is located in Hardwick Township, New Jersey. Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco is notable for having been the filming location of the first \"Friday the 13th\" film, which Lt. Eric Kranz appeared in two years before the discovery of Princess Doe's body.\n\nThe \"Princess Doe\" portrayed in this episode bears no resemblance to the actual murder victim. The episode's version of the Princess Doe case resembles the unsolved murder of Rosa Delgado, who was found missing her head and hands in Warren County, New Jersey in November 1997. The occult aspects presented in this episode appear to be based on notable supposed cult killings in New Jersey, such as the 1972 death of Jeannette DePalma, a teenaged resident of suburban Springfield whose body was found allegedly surrounded by \"occult symbols\".\n\nThe case was featured on \"America's Most Wanted\" in 2012 in hopes to generate new information in the case.\n\nThe same year, the most recent reconstruction was broadcast on CNN.\n\nPrincess Doe was buried on January 22, 1983 after she had remained unidentified for over five months. Funds were donated for a coffin and headstone for the victim.\nOn July 15, 2012, a memorial service was held for the 30th anniversary of Princess Doe being discovered, at the top of the ravine where her remains were found. Over 100 citizens attended as well as several reporters and cameras. The victim's clothing as well as her reconstructions were displayed for public viewing.\n\nOn October 12, 2014, Princess Doe was honored at a missing person's rally in the area.\n\n\n"}

It incorporated recommendations concerning cyberbullying and the distribution of intimate images that were made in 2013 to federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for public safety. It also serves to implement obligations arising from Canada's accession to the \"Convention on Cybercrime\" in 2001.\n\nCritics have argued Bill C-13 capitalized on the recent tragedies and deaths of Rehtaeh Parsons and Amanda Todd. MP Claude Gravelle, noted in House of Commons debates: \"the Conservatives decided to include things that have nothing to do with cyberbullying. For example, there is a subclause on terrorists and something else on people who steal cable television signals, which has absolutely nothing to do with cyberbullying\". Meanwhile, Senator Mobina Jaffer argued in debates of the Senate, \"Amanda Todd's and Rehtaeh Parsons’ lives would have been no different if this bill had been enacted earlier\". This legislation will make it illegal to distribute images of a person, in any way without their consent. It is said this could also violate people's privacy by giving authorities more power to watch what they are doing online. Police now only need \"reasonable grounds for suspicion\" to get a warrant. These warrants can now include allowing police to access online data, phone records and digital tracking. \"The bill also grants immunity to telecoms that voluntarily hand over data, a sticking point raising privacy concerns.\" \"Critics have warned the bill's thresholds for warrants are too low and that the cyber bullying law is too broad and vague.\"\n\nThis bill was proposed four times previously, making Bill C-13 the fifth iteration of \"Lawful Access\" proposals introduced into Canadian Parliament. Liberal and Conservative governments have each attempted to introduce lawful access.\n\nLawful access was first proposed under Bill C-74 (short titled the Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act) by Former Liberal Prime Minister Paul Martin on November 15, 2005 but did not advance passed its first reading in the House of Commons as his Parliament was dissolved on November 28, 2005.\n\nOn June 18, 2009, Stephen Harper's Conservative government proposed two lawful access frameworks, Bill C-46 (short titled \"Investigative Powers for the 21st Century Act\") and Bill C-47 (short titled \"Technical Assistance for Law Enforcement in the 21st Century Act\"). These two policy proposals failed to advance beyond the House of Commons, as Stephen Harper prorogued Parliament on December 30, 2009, which was the second time within less 400 days (the first being on December 4, 2008).\n\nFollowing the Conservative's first failed attempt to introduce lawful access, Stephen Harper's government introduced three bills concurrently at the end of 2010: Bill C-50 (short titled \"Improving Access to Investigative Tools for Serious Crimes Act\"), Bill C-51 (short titled \"Investigative Powers for the 21st Century Act\") and Bill C-52 (short titled \"Investigating and Preventing Criminal Electronic Communications Act\"). These three policy proposals failed to advance as the Conservatives were defeated by a motion of non-confidence vote on March 25, 2011. This resulted in a federal election held later that year on May 2, 2011, which resulted in a Conservative majority government.\n\nAfter the Conservative's second failed attempt, Harper's Conservatives introduced Bill C-30 (short titled the Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act) on February 14, 2012. Bill C-30 was originally titled \"Lawful Access Act\" and tabled by Former Public Safety Minister, Vic Toews, but was withdrawn from the House of Commons and resubmitted one hour later under the new title, \"Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act\". Bill C-30 was renamed at the very last minute \"even though the bill actually made no reference to child predators except in its title\". If passed, Bill C-30 would have granted law enforcement and security intelligence agencies with expanded surveillance powers, mandated internet service providers (ISPs) to disclose Canadian subscriber information (such as metadata) without a warrant and compelled ISPs to reveal information transmitted over their networks without a warrant or judicial oversight. When criticized by Members of Parliament about privacy concerns and civil liberty issues, Vic Toews responded that Canadians \"can either stand with us or with the child pornographers\" on February 13, 2012. The next day, on February 14, 2012, Vic Toews lied to Canadians on national television on CTV News and denied that he ever made these comments, calling it \"a far crime from that\". In protest against Vic Toews, the hacktivist collective Anonymous targeted him to expose his hypocrisy and revealed that he was having an affair to highlight the dangers of anyone having warrantless access to Canadians' digital lives. The hacktivist collective declared, \"Anonymous will not allow a politician who allows his citizens no secrets to have any secrets of his own\" on a video uploaded to YouTube. Bill C-30 was ultimately abandoned and Former Conservative Justice Minister, Rob Nicholson, promised Canadians that future attempts to introduce lawful access \"will not contain the measures contained in C-30\" on February 11, 2013.\n\nDespite this declaration, the Conservatives introduced Bill C-13 on November 20, 2013, which was the fifth iteration for the bill.\n\n"}

The event took place on March 17, 2002, in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico. The tournament consisted of a semi-final round of four four-man elimination matches and a final match with the winners of each of the semi-finals facing off in an elimination match until only one man remained. The final of the 2002 tournament pitted Canek, Pirata Morgan, Cibernético and Octagón against each other. The show featured two additional matches beyond the five tournament matches.\n\nStarting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican \"Lucha Libre\", or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious 'ey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's \"Rey\". Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual \"Reina de Reinas\" (\"Queen of Queens\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2002 show was the sixth Rey de Reyes show in the series.\n\nThe Rey de Reyes show featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n"}

{"id": "225164", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=225164", "title": "San Fermín", "text": "San Fermín\n\nThe festival of San Fermín is a week-long, historically rooted celebration held annually in the city of Pamplona, Navarra , Spain. \nThe celebrations start at noon on the sixth of July, when the party starts with the setting off the pyrotechnic \"chupinazo\", and continue until midnight, on the fourteenth of July, with the singing of the \"Pobre de Mí\". While its most famous event is the encierro, or the running of the bulls, at 8:00 AM from July 7 to 14, the festival involves many other traditional and folkloric events. It is known locally as \"Sanfermines\" and is held in honor of Saint Fermin, the co-patron of Navarre. Its events were central to the plot of \"The Sun Also Rises\", by Ernest Hemingway, which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. It has become probably the most internationally renowned fiesta in Spain. Over 1,000,000 people come to participate in this festival.\n\nFermín is said to have been the son of a Roman of senatorial rank in Pamplona in the 3rd century, who was converted to Christianity by Saint Honestus, a disciple of Saint Saturninus. According to tradition, he was baptised by Saturninus (in Navarre also known as Saint Cernin) at the spot now known as the \"Small Well of Saint Cernin\" Fermín was ordained a priest in Toulouse, and returned to Pamplona as its first bishop. On a later preaching voyage, Fermín was beheaded in Amiens, France; and is now considered a martyr in the Catholic Church. It is believed he died on September 25, AD 303. There is no written record of veneration of the Saint in Pamplona until the 12th century. Saint Fermín, as well as Saint Francis Xavier, are now the two patrons of Navarre. In Pamplona, Saint Fermín is now sometimes said to have met his end by being dragged through the streets with angry bulls running after him, hence the tradition.\nThe celebration of the festival has its origin in the combination of two different medieval events. Commercial secular fairs were held at the beginning of the summer. As cattle merchants came into town with their animals, eventually bullfighting came to be organized as a part of the tradition. Specifically, they were first documented in the 14th century. On the other hand, religious ceremonies honoring the saint were held on October 10. However, in 1591 they were transferred to July 7 to take place at the same time as the fair, when Pamplona's weather is better. This is considered to be the beginning of the Sanfermines. During medieval times acts included an opening speech, musicians, tournaments, theatre, bullfights, dances or even fireworks. Bullrunning appears in 17th and 18th century chronicles together with the presence of foreigners and the first concerns about the excessive drinking and dissolute behavior during the event. Finally, the Parade of Giants was created in the mid-19th century. The first official bullring was constructed in 1844.\nThe worldwide fame of the modern festival, and the great number of foreign visitors it receives every year, are closely related to the description in Ernest Hemingway's book The Sun Also Rises and the reports he made as a journalist. He was fascinated when he first visited in 1923, and returned many times until 1959. Hemingway was also deeply fond of bullrunnings and bullfights, but he did not participate in the running. Different city locations such as \"La Perla Hotel\" or the \"Iruña Café\" are famous in part due to the fact that the writer used to visit them. Another famous American author, James Michener, wrote extensively about the festival and bullfighting in his non-fiction book \"Iberia\". His writing explained the art and business of bullfighting with tremendous 'gracia' by explaining the importance of 'pundonor'.\n\nThe San Fermín Festival of the past was not like it is today: it has changed gradually both for better and for worse. Originally most of the youth looked forward to the festivities all year, saving money until they had at least fifty pesetas, the minimum necessary to watch the running of the bulls, have a snack and wine, eat lunch and dinner out, and eat churros with brandy a couple of times each San Fermín day.\n\nAfter the religious function, the group formed by the Authorities and village, they came back to the Home of “the town”, at about 90 minutes after leaving it. Then was effectuated the move, to contemplate the bulls that while they were waiting to move, they grazed in the grove.\n\nThe opening of the festival is marked by setting off the pyrotechnic \"chupinazo\" (or \"txupinazo\" in Basque language). The rocket is launched at 12:00 noon on July 6 from a city hall balcony with thousands of people celebrating the act in the city hall square and other locations in Pamplona. The chupinazo has officially marked the beginning of the fiesta since 1941. The person who sets it off is decided by the city mayor. Nevertheless, since 1979 tradition has been that each year after city elections the chupinazo is set off by a person from the different city council political groups beginning with the mayor and then political groups ordered by number of representatives. There have been exceptions to this tradition with some non-politicians being in charge of the act when they had performed significant achievements during the year. Examples of these exceptions were a player of the local soccer team, or the president of the \"giants and big-heads\" group in its 150 years anniversary.\n\nThe \"Riau-Riau\" was a mass activity held on July 6. The members of the city council parade from the City Hall to a nearby chapel dedicated to Saint Fermín with participants dancing to the \"Astrain Waltz\" along the way. The ritual was introduced in 1911 by Ignacio Baleztena Ascárate. The procession was removed from the festival calendar in 1992 for the sake of public order, as political activists used the \"Riau-Riau\" to promote clashes with authorities. Protesting youths would often block the way and it often took up to five hours for the city councilors to walk the 500 meters to the Saint Fermin chapel. Nevertheless, in recent years it has been held unofficially without the participation of the members of the city council. In 1996 and 2012 there were two failed attempts to restore the original act with the participation of the city council, both of them being cancelled due to the violent clashes with some participants.\n\nThe key day of the festival is July 7, when thousands of people accompany the 15th-century statue of Saint Fermin through the old part of Pamplona. The statue is accompanied by dancers and street entertainers, and different political and religious authorities including the city mayor. During procession a Jota (an ancient traditional dance) is performed for the saint, a rose is offered in the Saint Fernin well, and the \"gigantes\" (enormous wood-framed and papier-mâché puppet figures managed from inside) dance and twirl while the cathedral bell named María (Mary) peals.\n\n\"El Struendo\" (\"The Roar\") is a single day event with more than 50 years of tradition. It has been purposely left outside the official program and each year is celebrated on a different day, usually on a weekday so as to keep the crowds manageable. People gather at 11:59 pm at the Town Hall and make as much noise as possible for several hours mainly with drums but also bowls, whistles or any other objects.\n\nAfter nine days of partying, the people of Pamplona meet in the City Hall Plaza at midnight on July 14, singing the traditional mournful notes of the \"Pobre de Mí\" ('Poor Me'), in a candlelit ending. The city mayor closes the festival with participants lighting a candle and removing their red handkerchief as the song is played by the local band, followed by a fireworks display at the city hall. This closing ceremony tradition started out in the 1920s.\n\nThe running of the bulls (In Spanish \"encierro or los toros de san Fermin\") involves hundreds of people running in front of six bulls and another six steers down an 825-meter (0.51 mile) stretch of narrow streets of a section of the old town of Pamplona. The run ends in the Pamplona's bullring taking a mean time of around 3 minutes where the bulls would be held until the afternoon's bullfight when they would be killed. Bullruns are held between July 7 and 14 and a different \"encaste\" (sub-breed) of bull appears each day.\n\nThe event begins at 8 a.m. when a first firecracker is lit to announce the release of the bulls from their corral. Before the year 1924 it started at 6 and at 7 between 1924 and 1974. Runners gather earlier at the beginning of the itinerary to ask for the protection of the Saint by singing a chant three times before a small statue of San Fermín which has been placed in a raised niche in a wall: “\"To San Fermin we ask to be our patron saint and to guide us in the running of the bulls, giving to us his blessing\"”. A second cracker signals that the last bull has left the corral. There are six fighting bulls accompanied by six oxen (often white and brown colored) that guide them to the \"plaza\" and followed by three more not fighting oxen. There are also some shepherds guiding the bulls, wearing green T-shirts and holding long poles. Once all of the bulls have entered the arena, a third rocket is released while a fourth firecracker indicates that the bulls are in their bullpens and the run has concluded. After the end of the run young cows with wrapped horns are released in the bullring and toss the participants, to the amusement of the crowd.\n\nThe circuit has only changed slightly since 1852 as the former bullring was located close to the present one. Before that date the bullrunning ended in the \"castle plaza\", still not far from the present bullring. While the origin of this tradition was the necessity to move the bulls from outside the city to the bullring for the bullfight it is not clear when citizens began to run in front of them. There are written records in 1787 that the tradition was already well established with no memory of its beginning. The tradition of singing for protection to the saint dates back to 1962.\n\nThe event is dangerous. Since 1925, 15 people have been killed during the event –– most recently on July 10, 2009—and every year between 200 and 300 people are injured during the run although most injuries are contusions due to falls and are not serious.\n\nEvery day, during the morning, there is a parade of \"gigantes y cabezudos\" (English: \"giants and big-heads\", respectively), with the giant figures being more than 150 years old. The eight giant figures were built by Tadeo Amorena, a painter from Pamplona, in 1860, and represent four pairs of kings and queens of four different races and places (Europe, Asia, America and Africa). Their height is around each, and they are carried by a dancer inside a wooden structure. During the parade, giants dance following the rhythm of traditional music. The remaining 17 figures include 6 \"kilikis\", 5 big-heads, and 6 \"zaldikos\", built at different times between 1860 and 1941. \"Kilikis\" and big-heads are caricaturesque, but human-like figures that are carried as helmets. Big-heads masks are up to tall, and \"kilikis\" slightly smaller. While big-heads simply precede the giants and wave their hands at spectators, \"kilikis\" run after children, hitting them with a foam truncheon. \"Zaldikos\", figures representing horses with their riders, also run after children with a truncheon.\n\nThere are exhibitions and competitions of Basque rural sports every morning in the \"Plaza de los Fueros\", a square close to the city citadel, although they were formerly held in the bullring. Sports include stone lifting, wood cutting, or hay bale lifting. On the other hand, the Jai alai tournament of Sanfermin is a prestigious competition of this variety of basque pelota. It is held in one of the courts of the city. Betting is common during these events.\n\nEvery afternoon from July 7 to 14 there is a bullfight in which the 6 bulls that have been driven to the bullring during the bullrunning of that day are killed. It begins at 6pm. In addition the 5th bullfight with younger bulls and not fully trained bullfighters is performed while the 6th features bullfighters on horses (in Spanish \"rejoneo\"). While the bullring of the city is the fourth largest in size in the world, it is full every afternoon and tickets are hard to find.\n\nEvery night at 23:00, a firework spectacle is held at the citadel park. Fireworks spectacles have been known to occur in Sanfermin as far back as 1595. Since the year 2000 an international fireworks contest is held. Thousands of people watch them seated on the grass around the citadel.\n\n\n"}

After the German invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June 1941, German forces advanced rapidly through the Soviet-occupied Baltic states, and by the end of August the Estonian capital of Tallinn was surrounded by German forces, while a large part of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet was bottled up in Tallinn harbour.\n\nIn expectation of a Soviet breakout, the Kriegsmarine and the Finnish Navy had started on 8 August 1941 to lay minefields off Cape Juminda on the Lahemaa coast. While Soviet minesweepers tried to clear a path for convoys through the minefields, German coastal artillery installed a battery of guns near Cape Juminda and the Finnish navy gathered their 2nd Motor Torpedo Boat Flotilla with patrol boats VMV9, VMV10, VMV11 and VMV17. At the same time the German 3. Schnellbootflottille with E-boats S-26, S-27, S-39, S-40 and S-101 was concentrated at Suomenlinna outside Helsinki. German Junkers Ju 88 bombers from Kampfgruppe 806 based on airfields in Estonia were put on alert. On 19 August the final German assault on Tallinn began.\nDuring the night of 27/28 August 1941 the Soviet 10th Rifle Corps disengaged from the enemy and boarded transports in Tallinn.\n\nThe embarkation was protected by smoke screens, however, the mine-sweeping in the days before the evacuation began was ineffective due to bad weather, and there were no Soviet aircraft available for protecting the embarkation. This, together with heavy German shelling and aerial bombardment killed at least 1,000 of the evacuees in the harbor.\n\nTwenty large transports, eight auxiliary ships, nine small transports, a tanker, a tug, and a tender were organized into four convoys, protected by the Soviet cruiser \"Kirov\", with Admiral Vladimir Tributs on board, two flotilla leaders, nine destroyers, three torpedo boats, twelve submarines, ten modern and fifteen obsolete minehunters, 22 minesweepers, 21 submarine chasers, three gun boats, a minelayer, thirteen patrol vessels and eleven torpedo boats.\n\nOn 28 August KG 77 and KGr 806 sank the 2,026 grt steamer \"Vironia\", the 2,317 grt \"Lucerne\", the 1,423 grt \"Atis Kronvalds\" and the 2,250 grt ice breaker \"Krisjanis Valdemars\". The rest of the Soviet fleet were forced to change course. This took them through a heavily mined area. As a result, 21 Soviet warships, including five destroyers, struck mines and sank. On 29 August, the Luftwaffe, now reinforced with KG 76, KG 4 and KG 1, accounted for the transport ships \"Vtoraya Pyatiletka\" (3,974 grt), \"Kalpaks\" (2,190 grt) and \"Leningradsovet\" (1,270 grt) sunk. In addition, the ships \"Ivan Papanin\", \"Saule\", \"Kazakhstan\" and the \"Serp i Molot\" were damaged by I./KG 4, which also sank three more. Some 5,000 Soviet soldiers died.\n\nLater that evening the armada was attacked by Finnish and German torpedo boats, and the chaotic situation made organized mine sweeping impossible. Darkness fell at 22:00 and the Soviet armada stopped and anchored at midnight in the heavily mined water.\n\nEarly on 29 August Ju 88 bombers attacked the remains of the convoys off Suursaari, sinking two transports. Meanwhile, the undamaged ships made best speed to reach the safety of the Kronstadt batteries. The heavily damaged merchant ship \"Kazakhstan\" disembarked 2300 men of the 5000 on board before steaming on to Kronstadt. In the following days ships operating from Suursaari rescued 12,160 survivors.\n\nThe Soviet evacuation of Tallinn succeeded in evacuating 165 ships, 28,000 passengers and 66,000 tons of equipment. At least 12,400 are thought to have drowned in circumstances little known outside the former Soviet Union. The event was long downplayed by the Communist regime after the war. The evacuation may have been the bloodiest naval disaster since the battle of Lepanto.\n\nOn the sixtieth anniversary a memorial was unveiled at Juminda.\n\n\nAlso, mines heavily damaged destroyer Minsk, destroyers Gordy and Slavnyi , minesweeper T-205 and other ships.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4874760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4874760", "title": "The Photographer", "text": "The Photographer\n\nThe Photographer is a three-part mixed media performance accompanied by music (also sometimes referred to as a chamber opera) by composer Philip Glass. The libretto is based on the life and homicide trial of 19th-century English photographer Eadweard Muybridge. Commissioned by the Holland Festival, the opera was first performed in 1982 at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam.\n\nEadweard Muybridge was an English-born photographer who relocated to the American West and was an early pioneer in photographic technology. He photographed well-known landscapes of Yosemite that pushed the aesthetic and technological boundaries of the medium. His early photographic motion studies conducted in association with Leland Stanford led to the earliest moving photographic images. \n\nIn 1874, Muybridge murdered Major Harry Larkyns (referred to as 'Colonel Harry Larkyns' in this work), whom he suspected of being his wife's lover, and was acquitted by a jury against the instructions of the judge on the ground of justifiable homicide. His trial is well-known because his defense argued that a head injury incurred in a stagecoach accident altered his personality, which modern neuroscientists believe could have been caused by certain types of brain damage. \n\nThe text included in Glass' work is based on words drawn from the transcripts of the trial and Muybridge's actual letters to his wife. The second act features a slideshow of Muybridge's photographs. While based on historical events in Muybridge's life, the work also comments on aspects of Muybridge's work, melding both themes.\n\nThe form of this work consists of three acts: a play with incidental music, a concert accompanying a slideshow of Muybridge's work, and a dance with musical accompaniment. In total, the piece lasts about 90 minutes.\n\nAct I is a play that includes three incidental pieces of music that fit into the play. The play recounts Muybridge's murder of Major Harry Larkyns and the trial, with an irreverent tone. \n\nThe incidental piece \"A Gentleman's Honor\", includes words drawn from the actual trial transcript, commentary, and Muybridge's letters. It draws on the incident in which Flora sent Larkyns a portrait of Muybridge's son Florado, seeming to imply that Larkyns could be the father ('Whose baby is this'), and draws on the commentary of spectators ('All that white hair and a long white beard'), as well as referencing Muybridge's carriage accident and his later motion studies ('Horses in the air '). The phrases 'Artificial moonlight' and 'Artificial sky' may refer to techniques used by Muybridge in his landscape technology (overlaying clouds onto his images). Glass notes that he originally conceived the text of A Gentleman's Honor as based on a poem by Muybridge called \"Circles\", but Glass reconsidered and asked David Byrne to use material from the trial itself, as well as Muybridge's letters. \n\nAct II is a violin solo, or \"concert\", that either features a figure representing Muybridge in the darkroom in the background or a slideshow of images by Muybridge. Critics have compared the see-saw sounds of the solo violin to a hoe-down or \"early American\" sound, although Glass claims this analogy was not necessarily intentional.\n\nIn Act III, the characters from Act I return for a dance (including Muybridge, Flora, Larkyns, and Victorian bystanders). In some productions, the dance features photographs \"developed\" in the second half.\n\nThe preview of this work premiered in May 1982 at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam for Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands and commissioned by the Holland Festival, and its first public performance was in June 1982 as part of the Holland Festival, for which the work was commissioned. The work was suggested and developed by the Dutch director/designer Rob Malasch. Later, Glass rewrote the piece and renamed it \"The Photographer: Far from the Truth\". Though based on Malasch's original premise, this new version of the play was rewritten by Rob Coe. Glass also performed this work as a selection of incidental songs from Act I and the instrumental work in Act III. \n\nGlass's distinctive minimalist musical style complements the theme of the opera, since the ideas of repetitive sounds and small changes seem to mirror Muybridge's techniques in his famous motion studies. Despite Muybridge's achievements and this relationship to the composer's work, the work does not necessarily treat the subject of Muybridge's trial reverently, and the dance appears to use the subject as an opportunity to comment on the contradictory mores of Muybridge's own time. Glass has stated that he intended to reflect the idea of a \"Victorian melodrama\" in his music. \n\nThis piece seems to show Glass's transitioning from ensemble works like Einstein on the Beach to more traditional instrumentation in his later works. Glass has stated that using the word \"minimalist\" to apply to this work is \"misleading\" and would not reflect what the listener would expect to hear. \n\nThe recording was conceived with the idea that most listeners would not have experienced the stage work. Several pieces were shortened or left off the album entirely, and the order of the music is changed. Only two of the original three incidental pieces contained in Act I are included.\n\nThe album was released on June 26, 1984 by CBS Records / Epic and is just 42 minutes long (compared to the 90-minute-long original work).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24610054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24610054", "title": "The Triumph of St. Joan", "text": "The Triumph of St. Joan\n\nThe Triumph of St. Joan was originally an opera in three acts by Norman Dello Joio to an English language libretto on the subject of the martyrdom of Joan of Arc by Dello Joio and Joseph Machilis. It was premiered at Sarah Lawrence College on May 9, 1950. Although the opera was received positively, the composer was unhappy with the work and declined to have it performed again. However, he did adapt part of the opera into a symphony of the same title in 1951. The symphony was later renamed \"Seraphic Ode\".\n\nDello Joio returned to the subject of Joan of Arc in 1955 when he was commissioned by the NBC Television Opera Theatre to produce an original 75-minute opera for television. The resulting work in two acts was retitled The Trial at Rouen, and, in using new music and a new libretto by Dello Joio, was in effect a completely different musical drama from its predecessor. It premiered on April 8, 1956 on NBC. Dello Joio adapted the work a third time, extending the music at the beginning and end of the 1956 version (including some music from the 1950 opera) to create a one-act opera for the stage. This third version, once again called \"The Triumph of St. Joan\", was premiered by the New York City Opera on April 16, 1959.\n\nDello Joio was on the faculty of Sarah Lawrence College (SLC) and the college was looking to produce a theatrical work that could be a collaborative project across different departments. The composer had been contemplating writing an opera for a number of years already but had not found a subject matter that inspired him until attending the 1948 film \"Joan of Arc\" with his friend Joseph Machilis, a writer, musician, and Queens College, City University of New York, faculty member. The two men both agreed that an opera focusing on the \"inner motivations and spiritual life of Joan\" could be derived effectively and movingly and that it would make a good project for SLC. Over the next 11 months the two men laboured together to create the opera's libretto and Dello Joio composed the music in this time as well.\n\nThe original 1950 opera encompassed three soloists, an opera chorus, and dancers. The SLC's music and dance departments made up the cast and the production was accompanied by two pianos. The school's theatre majors specializing in the technical aspects of the stage designed and built the sets, lights, and costumes. Conductor Hugh Ross directed the chorus and all told a total of 85 SLC students were involved in putting the opera together. A grant from the Whitney Foundation provided much of the financial backing needed to mount the opera.\nThe opera premiered at Bates Hall on the campus of SLC on May 9, 1950. Gisela Weber created the title role with Jerome Swinford as Pierre Cauchon and John Druary as the Dauphin of France/Charles VII of France. The opera opens with Joan in her prison cell after her trial and sentence of execution. Awaiting her death alone, her memories of past events come to life on stage with intermittent periods returning her to her present moment of solitude. Flashbacks include her meeting with the Dauphin the day before the Siege of Orléans, his coronation at Rheims, the breach in the relationship between Charles and Joan, and Cauchon's condemning of her at her trial. Music critics Olin Downes noted the following about the integral part of chorus: The chorus plays a many-sided role. Now, in the solitude of Joan's cell, it is the whispering voice of her sorely tired spirit; now it is active and potent participant in the drama, as in the coronation scene, or in the scene between Joan and the Bishop of Beauvaris, denouncing her; now it is the Greek commentator on the tragedy.\n\nOverall the reception for Dello Joio's first rendition of \"The Triumph of St. Joan\" was positive. However, the composer was himself unhappy with the work and, although there was some interest in a professional staging of the opera, Dello Joio withdrew the work from such considerations. He did take some of the music and adapt it into a symphony which was first performed by the Louisville Orchestra on December 5 and 6, 1951. At the premiere, renowned dancer Martha Graham performed the role of Joan of Arc using her own choreography. The symphony is organized into three movements. The first movement, entitled \"The Maid\", is a theme and variation in 6/8 with flute and oboe soloists on the melody. The second movement, \"The Warrior\", is written in 12/8 with a great deal of intensity until it moves into a stately 4/4. Of the final movement, \"The Saint\", Dello Joio said, \"I cannot urge you strongly enough to have the orchestra sing the last movement. I do not feel the end of this piece should be tragic but rather one of triumphant serenity. Joan must have welcomed the fire for it was the final test which led to her salvation.\"\n\nPeter Herman Adler of the NBC Opera Theatre was interested in Dello Joio's work and in 1955 he commissioned the composer to provide the company with a new opera for television. Feeling he had not said what he wanted to say about Joan of Arc, Dello Joio returned to her as the source of this new work. He wrote an entirely new libretto in two acts, going back to the historical documents of her trial as a source for the new text. He also wrote completely new music for the opera. Dello Joio commented on this process: \"The Trial at Rouen\" is not a version of my first opera, but is a completely new statement, both musically and dramatically; though the temptation to use the old material was great... The premise of my opera is simple. My conclusion is that the Joan story recounts the ageless conflict between the individual of excessive imagination and those who hold to the status quo. I was aware of how dangerous this concept was, because singing philosophy can be a bore. But, in reading the intense human drama between Joan and her accusers leaped forth from the pages in highly emotional terms.\n\nIn \"The Trial of Rouen\", Dello Joio completely removed the character of the Dauphin of France/Charles VII of France, choosing instead to focus on Joan's trial and execution. The production starred soprano Elaine Malbin in the title role, baritone Hugh Thompson as Cauchon, bass Chester Watson as Father Julien, and baritone Paul Ukena as the Jailer. There were also six inquisitors and three heavenly voices in the cast. Peter Herman Adler conducted the Symphony of the Air for the production. The opera was broadcast nationally on NBC television on April 8, 1956, to an audience in the millions. Music critic Howard Taubman was overall positive about the work, stating that \"The NBC Television opera gave \"The Trial at Rouen\" a brilliant production, one of the best in a growing line of video presentations.\" However, his comments on the effectiveness of the work were mixed. He said the following in his review in \"The New York Times\": \"The Trial at Rouen\" is a high-minded attempt to come to grips with the subject of the martyrdom of Saint Joan. Its mood is reverent without turning ponderous. It is always lyrical and occasionally tense with drama. It combines words and music with an ease that makes the enfolding of the song seem natural and with a poetry that heightens its emotion... Does his opera give us Joan in all her innocence and radiance? One would have to say it comes close but is defeated in the end. One of Mr. Dello Joio's troubles is that his libretto lacks contrast and his characters are almost of one shade. In the case of Joan, this fault is rectified by variety and subtlety in the music. However, the music, though it is not afraid to sing, lets us down in the climaxes by failing to sing with sufficient intensity.\n\nAfter the somewhat mixed success of \"The Trial at Rouen\", Dello Joio felt that he could still improve upon his opera further. He continued to work on the opera adding additional music to the beginning and end. He took some music from the original 1950 opera, a short aria for an English sentry (a character in the original opera but not the television version), and tagged it onto the beginning of the first act. He also added an impassioned extended farewell aria for Joan at the end of the opera. Although the work was now longer than the 1956 version, it was structured into one act instead of two.\n\nIn 1958 Julius Rudel offered to include Dello Joio's revised one-act opera, now retitled \"The Triumph of St. Joan\", in the 1958–1959 New York City Opera (NYCO) season. He readily accepted and the work was premiered by the NYCO on April 16, 1959, in a double bill with Gian Carlo Menotti's \"The Medium\". The cast included Lee Venora in the title role, Mack Harrell as Cauchon, Chester Watson as Father Julien, Chester Ludgin as the Jailer, and tenor Frank Porretta as the Sentry. Herbert Grossman conducted the opera which was staged by José Quintero and included sets by David Hays and costumes by Ruth Morely.

The song inspired several other media, such as an autobiographical book by Uemura, as well as a special drama to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the opening of Mainichi Broadcasting System.\n\nThe song was awarded two Japan Record Awards in 2010, one in the general song category along with 9 other songs, as well as Uemura being awarded the lyricist award for the song.\n\nThe song is a ballad, beginning with a simple guitar-based arrangement, however later expanding to a band and orchestra arrangement. The song's lyrics are an extended narrative that tell the story of Uemura and her grandmother. When she was a 3rd grader (8 years old), she lived at her grandmother's house next door to her parents, playing gomoku, eating nanban-style duck noodle soup when they went out shopping, watching videotapes of the comedy program \"Yoshimoto Shinkigeki\" and helping her every day. Uemura was not very fond of cleaning toilets, so her grandmother told her that a beautiful goddess lives in the toilet, if she cleaned it every day, this goddess would make her into a beautiful woman. As Uemura grew older, the communication gap between her and her grandmother worsened and the two grew apart. Uemura, feeling resentful, moved away from home with her then boyfriend and rarely came home to visit. Her grandmother later became more ill and was hospitalized two years after Uemura left for Tokyo. Uemura visited her, saying \"Grandma, I'm home!\" as she used to when she was little, before the two began to fight. Her grandmother could not say much and the next morning died quietly in her sleep. Uemura believes her grandmother was waiting for her, besides being left alone from her all this time. She feels regret for hurting her grandmother and says thank you to her at the end of the song.\n\nThe song mentions several words in Kansai dialect, especially in the way the grandmother speaks. She adds to the ends of her sentences, and uses specifically Kansai terms, such as and , instead of standard Japanese and . Uemura thanks her grandmother by saying , as opposed to . While the song is called \"Toilet no Kamisama,\" the word is not used in the song, instead the song talks about a in the toilet.\n\nWhen Uemura met music producer Yohito Teraoka, her self-introduction featured the story of her grandmother. Teraoka suggested they turn this story into a song.\n\nThe song was first aired at FM802, on \"Hiro T's Morning Jam\" on January 7, 2010, and began receiving radio play in the song's full length. The song was released as a free ringtone from February 10, until March 9, when it became a paid ringtone.\n\nUemura performed at the 61st \"Kōhaku Uta Gassen\" New Years' singing battle. She performed the full-length version of \"Toilet no Kamisama.\" The performance was one of the longest in Kōhaku's history, after Tsuyoshi Nagabuchi's 15 minute performance in 1990. She also performed the song on Yoshimoto Shinkigeki's new years' special during the curtain call, the television show mentioned in Uemura's song.\n\nTwo music videos were produced for the song: a live action version directed by Tatsuaki, which was shot on January 23, 2010, and an animated version by Daisuke Hashimoto, set to the version from \"\" featuring Kotaro Oshio.\n\nThe live action version features Uemura performing the song on guitar on a sunlit river bank, interspersed with scenes of a grandmother and several different actresses portraying the scenes described in the song. The final scenes show the grandmother walking with the adolescent actress along the river bank where Uemura sung the song. The Hashimoto animated version similarly enacts the storyline from the song, featuring drawings of a grandmother and a small girl. The video's artwork is based on the \"Toilet no Kamisama\" picture book, illustrated by Mari Torigoe, and released in September 2010.\n\nThe song inspired two books by Uemura, both with the same title. The first is an autobiography released in July 2010 through Takarajimasha, telling anecdotes about her grandmother and the process of making the song. The second is a picture book version, published through Kodansha in September 2010. The version features illustrations by Mari Torigoe.\n\nMainichi Broadcasting System, Inc. aired a two-hour drama based on the autobiography \"Toilet no Kamisama\" on January 5, 2011, on 28 stations including itself, TBS and CBC, also on Akita TV on January 8. It was one of the programs for the 60th anniversaty of the opening of MBS. The drama starred Kii Kitano as Uemura, and Shima Iwashita as her grandmother. The drama's plot is inspired by the events described in Uemura's \"Toilet no Kamisama\" autobiography, such as the death of her grandfather and her path to becoming a singer.\n\nUnder the influence of the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami which occurred on March 11, 2011, MBS aired the drama again on March 16, instead of \"Ichi-Hachi Final Special\", on 26 stations except TBC and TV U Fukushima.\n\nThe drama received the TV Film Prize in the 17th Shanghai TV Festival International Program Contest in May 2011.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This view is according to deobandi movement which was established recently in 1867 in the muslim umma after the wake of the failed Sepoy Rebellion in northern India, but not all \"bida\" (innovation) are prohibited according to sharia law and the prophetic traditions and the major scholars view. Some examples are:\n\nOn the day of the passing away of a Saint or on a specific date, their admirers, disciples, followers and relatives assemble together at the grave of the Saint to make esal-e-sawab, obtain spiritual benefit and celebrate the anniversary with rejoice. \n\nThe object of fixing the day and time of Urs is that the people become aware of this auspicious occasion. There is no harm in fixing the date and visiting the graves in gathering in fact this proven practice of prophet as cited in the forth coming sections.\n\nShah Abdul Aziz Muhaddith Dehlwi has written that if the day of Urs is meant for invocation or reminding for the deceased one, there is no harm.
