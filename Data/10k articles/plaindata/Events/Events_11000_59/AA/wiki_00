A four-hour firefight, precipitated by a speech by government minister Enos Nkala threatening that ZANLA would ultimately destroy ZIPRA, ended when the largely white-led BSAP Support Unit, numbering over 280 men from Echo Troop, Juliet Troop, Hotel Troop, Charlie Troop and Lima Troop, intervened on behalf of the government. (The Rhodesian African Rifles at that time were confined to barracks due to disagreements about integration into the new Zimbabwean National Army. They were officially on \"reaction standby\".) Officers from both guerrilla forces then called for a ceasefire.\n\nOfficial government figures counted 58 dead (15 combatants and 43 civilians) and over 500 wounded, but eyewitness accounts describe a death toll running into the hundreds. The conflict was followed four months later by the larger 1981 Entumbane Uprising, also known as Entumbane II, which nearly developed into a new civil war.\n\n"}

Tokyo was ultimately elected as the host city at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 7 September 2013.\n\nThe Olympic bidding process begins with the submission of a city's application to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by its National Olympic Committee (NOC) and ends with the election of the host city by the members of the IOC during an ordinary session. The process is governed by the Olympic Charter, as stated in Chapter 5, Rule 34.\n\nSince 1999, the process has consisted of two phases. During the first phase, which begins immediately after the bid submission deadline, the \"applicant cities\" are required to answer a questionnaire covering themes of importance to a successful Games organization. This information allows the IOC to analyze the cities' hosting capacities and the strengths and weaknesses of their plans. Following a detailed study of the submitted questionnaires and ensuing reports, the IOC Executive Board selects the cities that are qualified to proceed to the next phase. The second phase is the true candidature stage: the accepted applicant cities (from now on referred to as \"candidate cities\") are required to submit a second questionnaire in the form of an extended, more detailed, candidature file. These files are carefully studied by the IOC Evaluation Commission, a group composed of IOC members, representatives of international sport federations, NOCs, athletes, the International Paralympic Committee, and international experts in various fields. It is chaired by Sir Craig Reedie. The members of the Evaluation Commission then make four-day inspection visits to each of the candidate cities, where they check the proposed venues and are briefed about details of the themes covered in the candidature file. The Evaluation Commission communicates the results of its inspections in a report sent to the IOC members up to one month before the electing IOC Session.\n\nThe IOC Session in which a host city is elected takes place in a country that did not submit an application to stage the Olympics. The election is made by the assembled active IOC members (excluding honorary and honor members), each possessing one vote. Members from countries that have a city taking part in the election cannot vote while the city is in the running. The voting is conducted in a succession of rounds until one bid achieves an absolute majority of votes; if this does not happen in the first round, the bid with the fewest votes is eliminated and another voting round begins. In the case of a tie for the lowest number of votes, a special runoff vote is carried out, with the winner proceeding to the next round. After each round, the eliminated bid is announced. Following the announcement of the host city, the successful bid delegation signs the \"Host City Contract\" with the IOC, which delegates the responsibilities of the Games organisation to the city and respective NOC.\n\nThe timeline of the host city selection process was approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) executive board as follows:\n\n\nSix cities were put forward by their respective National Olympic Committees (NOCs) to apply to host the Games initially, but Rome withdrew its bid shortly before the applicant files were due. The bidding cities come from two continents, Europe and Asia (Istanbul is considered to be located on the border between Asia and Europe). In 2020 it will be twelve years since an Asian city hosted the Summer Olympics (Beijing 2008) and eight years since a European city hosted the Summer Olympics (London 2012). Out of the six bidders, Tokyo had previously hosted the Summer Olympic Games in 1964. The other four bidders have made bids in the past. It is the first time in 20 years that no city in the Americas bid to host the Summer Olympic Games. Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Summer Olympics. Baku and Doha bid for the 2016 Games but failed to become candidate cities, while Tokyo and Madrid also bid for the 2016 Games and became candidate cities.\n\nThe IOC voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013 at the 125th IOC Session at the Buenos Aires Hilton in Buenos Aires, Argentina. An exhaustive ballot system was used. No city won over 50% of the votes in the first round, and Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place. A run-off vote between these two cities was held to determine which would be eliminated. In the final vote, a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul, Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36 votes.\nThe candidate cities for the 2020 Olympics are, in order of drawing lots:\n\n\nIt was announced at the 1 September 2011 deadline for bidding that Baku had submitted a bid to host the 2020 Olympics. Baku submitted their application file to the IOC on 1 February 2012. The National Assembly of Azerbaijan voted to endorse the bid in February 2012. Baku hosted the 2015 European Games.\n\nOn 26 August 2011, Doha announced that it was bidding for the 2020 Games.\n\nDoha hosted the 2006 Asian Games and the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In 2010, Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Several stadiums will be located in Doha. The country also hosted the 1988 and 2011 AFC Asian Cups.\n\n\nRome was nominated by the Italian National Olympic Committee on 19 May 2010. Italy's capital city was chosen over Venice as the country's bid for the 2020 Games.\n\nRome previously hosted the Summer Olympics in 1960 and was chosen to host the 1908 Summer Olympics, but was relocated to London due to the 1906 eruption of Mount Vesuvius. It bid to host the 2004 Games but lost to Athens in the final round of voting. Rome hosted the 2009 World Aquatics Championships as well as the 1990 FIFA World Cup Final. Italy previously hosted the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin and the 1956 Winter Olympics in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nHowever the Rome municipal administration withdrew its support from the bid on the eve of the delivery of the application files, stating that it would not be a responsible use of money in \"Italy's current condition.\"\n\nThe following cities proposed bidding; however, they did not bid or even formally announce their intentions to bid.\n\n\nThe following cities proposed submitting bids but announced prior to the 1 September deadline that they would not put forth a bid. The following list is in order of cancellation:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28234634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28234634", "title": "Bull running", "text": "Bull running\n\nBull running was a medieval custom practiced in England until the 19th century. It involved chasing a bull through the streets of a town until it was weakened, then slaughtering the animal and butchering it for its meat. Bull running became illegal in 1835, and the last bull run took place in Stamford, Lincolnshire, in 1839. The practice was not confined to any particular region, with bull runs also documented at Axbridge in the south west, Canterbury and Wokingham in the south east, Tutbury in the midlands, and Wisbech in the east.\n\nThe origins of the custom are uncertain, and the date of observance varied across the country. In Stamford, the bull run took place on St Brice's Day (13 November); in Tutbury, it was held on the Feast of the Assumption (15 August); and in Axbridge on Guy Fawkes Day (5 November).\n\nThe earliest documented instance of bull running appears in 1389, among medieval guild records collected by Joshua Toulmin Smith. The document—from Stamford's \"Gild of St. Martin\"—states that \"on the feast of St. Martin, this gild, by custom beyond reach of memory, has a bull; which bull is hunted [not \"baited\"] by dogs, and then sold; whereupon the bretheren and sisteren sit down to feast.\" The phrase \"custom beyond reach of memory\" leaves uncertainty about whether the custom pre-dated the guild—which was established by 1329—or was instituted by the guild itself. Local folklore in Stamford maintained that the tradition was begun by William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, during the reign of King John (1199—1216). The story, recorded by Richard Butcher in his \"The Survey and Antiquitie of Stamford Towne\" (1646), and described by Walsh as \"patently fictional\", relates how Warenne:\nA similar origin-story involving a noble is found at Tutbury, Staffordshire, where the tradition was said to have been started by John of Gaunt shortly after he married his Spanish wife, Constance of Castile, in 1372, in an effort to remind her of her home. The story was first advanced—purely as speculation—by Robert Plot in his \"The Natural History of Stafford-Shire\" (1686), where he writes:\nSamuel Pegge, addressing the Society of Antiquaries in 1765, dismissed Plot's conjecture as \"entirely mistaken\", while lamenting that it had become received wisdom in the interim. While John of Gaunt had established a Court of Minstrels at Tutbury in 1381, the bull running appears instead to have been instituted by the prior of Tutbury Priory (founded c.1080 as a dependency of the abbey at Saint-Pierre-sur-Dives) as part of the Feast of the Assumption celebrations which, as early as 1230, required the prior to provide \"a great feast\". Pegge also notes that the bull used for running was provided by the prior, and that the animal \"was turned out antiently at the abbey-gate, and by the prior; John of Gaunt or his officers being no way employed in that service.\"\n\nWalsh observed that the bull running that took place in November occurred in the calendar around Martinmas, which \"traditionally marked the slaughtering time for the beef, swine and geese not being maintained through the winter on stored feed.\" During the Anglo-Saxon period, November was called \"Blōtmōnaþ\" (\"sacrifice month\") or \"Blōdmōnaþ\" (\"blood month\"). Langeslag cautions: \"Whether the [Anglo-Saxons'] slaughter was accompanied by a celebration, and whether such a celebration would have been secular or religious, is not known, although a twelfth-century reader of Bede gave the month name the explanation 'because this is when they offered the cattle to be killed to their gods'. Whether this should be read as speculation or report, it is certain that the necessary conditions for a gathering, secular or religious, were in place at this time of year.\" William Fitzstephen, writing in 1173, indicates that, in London at least, the animals to be slaughtered were often first used for sport: \"[T]he youth are entertained in a morning with boars fighting to the last gasp, as likewise with hogs full tusked, intended to be converted into bacon; or game-bulls, and bears of a large bulk, are baited with dogs.\"\n\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBibliography\n"}

The festival, organized by brothers Eduardo and Alfonso Lopez Negrete's company Promotora Go, McCann Erickson executive and sports promoter and Telesistema Mexicano producer Luis de Llano Macedo, took place at the height of La Onda and celebrated life, youth, ecology, music, peace and free love, has been compared to the American Woodstock festival for its psychedelic music, counterculture imagery and artwork, and open drug use. A milestone in the history of Mexican rock music, the festival has drawn anywhere from an estimated 100,000 to 500,000 concertgoers.\n\nThe festival originally scheduled 12 bands booked by music impresarios Waldo Tena and Armando Molina Solis' agency, but a total of 18 acts performed outdoors during the first, sometimes rainy weekend, before a massive crowd. The event was captured in film by, among others, Cinematográfica Marco Polo, Telesistema Mexicano, Cablevision and . Audio was captured by Polydor Records and a live radio broadcast was sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company. Images of the festival were captured by photographers like Graciela Iturbide, Pedro Meyer and others.\n\nThe Super 8 short films \"Avándaro\" produced by Gutiérrez y Prieto of Cablevision and directed by Alfredo Gurrola and \"Tinta Blanca en Avándaro\" produced by Raul Candiani of Peliculas Candiani and directed by Humberto Rubalcaba were the only films exclusively about the first festival. They were exhibited at international film festivals and theaters in 1972. Other movies, which partially used footage of the festival, were the Cinematográfica Marco Polo film \"La verdadera vocación de Magdalena\" produced by Anuar Badin and directed by Jaime Humberto Hermosillo and the Super 8 films \"The year of the rat\" by Enrique Escalona and \"La segunda primera matriz\" by Alfredo Gurrola.\n\nAn accompanying soundtrack with a selection of the live recordings produced by Luis de Llano's company LUDELL/BAKITA Records and named \"Avandaro, por fin... 32 años después\" (Avandaro, at last ... 32 years later), was finally released in 2003.\n\nBy 1971 Mexico, ruled by the PRI, had organized two of the most important sporting events in the world: the 1970 FIFA World Cup and the 1968 Summer Olympics, gaining a fresh and modern image its government wanted to show to the outside world. At the same time, its government had violently repressed political youth movements known as the \"Tlatelolco massacre\" and the \"Halconazo\", which in turn gave way to the so-called Mexican Dirty War of the early 1970s.\n\nThe Mexican hippies, called \"jipitecas\" by Catholic priest and scholar Enrique Marroquin, created a multidisciplinary movement called \"La Onda\" (The wave). In accordance to their hippie values, La Onda did not advocate a violent overthrow of the PRI, but it did advocate change. By 1969 the government had already banned the musical \"Hair\" after a unique performance of it in Acapulco, censuring the rock band \"Los Shakes\" (which included stars Pixie Hopkin, Mayita Campos and Nono Zaldivar), investigating impresario Alfredo Elias Calles (grandson of late president Plutarco Elias Calles) and deporting foreign actors and producers like Michael Butler, Gerome Ragni and James Rado. Such actions were heavily covered by local and American media like The New York Times and Time. Writer Carlos Monsivais, who witnessed the event, wrote an extensive article about the incident in his book \"Dias de guardar\". Also in 1969, the band Pop Music Team had suffered censorship due to their hit \"Tlatelolco\" (which only had two weeks of radio airplay) and in February 1971 in Monterrey, a collective band called Sierra Madre, led by Teja Cunningham, and a state-of-the-art lights spectacle named \"Music and light show\" had faced repression after a failed attempt to hold a three-day concert, called \"Concierto Blanco\" (white concert) inside the State government palace in Monterrey's main square. The violent incidents after the White concert, which were extensively covered by the media, seriously damaged then Nuevo Leon governor political career.\n\nNews from Cuba (Varadero '70), Colombia (), Argentina (Festival Buenos Aires Rock), Chile (Festival de los Dominicos \"Piedra Roja\"), England (Isle of Wight) and films from American festivals like \"Monterey Pop\" and \"Woodstock\" fueled the desire for the jipitecas to host their own major counterculture event. The opportunity arrived in the spring of 1971.\n\nTrying to resurrect their popular auto racing spot, \"Circuito Avándaro\", after being cancelled in 1969 as a result of the fatal accident of racing driver Moisés Solana, \"Promotora Go\" owners brothers Eduardo and Alfonso López Negrete in partnership with McCann executive and sports promoter decided to organize a massive auto race with live rock music acts and consulted then Telesistema Mexicano promoter Luis de Llano Macedo to video-record the motoring event and to hire and La Revolución de Emiliano Zapata, two of the most popular Mexican rock acts of the time. Luis de Llano was at the time producing a section named \"La onda de Woodstock\" in the Jacobo Zabludovsky's program \"Hoy Domingo\" (Today Sunday). De Llano assembled a team of around 330 individuals to organize the music part of the festival, among them reporter/musicologist Jaime Almeida, screenwriter Armando Molina Solis, publicist Carlos Alazraki, and MCs Roberto Naranjo and Eduardo Davis. Molina, himself an impresario and musician from \"La Maquina del Sonido\" fame, was appointed Music Coordinator. The music coordination was in the hands of the company ArTe, owned by Molina and Waldo Tena (of fame). After many negotitations and declining invitations Molina proceeded to book 12 bands.\nDesigner Joe Vera was hired to design the official poster and tickets were sold at AUTOMEX-Chrysler agencies across the country for MX$25. Jacobo Zabludovsky heavily supported and promoted the festival in his daily news program \"24hrs\" and he was one of the few mainstream broadcasters to defend it in its aftermath.\n\nAs was reported in the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, a maximum of 25,000 attendees, 122 pilots with their staff (with their number expected to reduce after the technical inspections) and 12 Mexican bands with a possible last-minute inclusion of American bands to bolster the event was expected. The bands were going to play from Saturday 7 pm to Sunday 7 am, making way for the auto race to start in public roads around the lake. 2 weeks before the event, the 5 hotels in town were already booked. In the TV Azteca documentary \"Historias Engarzadas: Alex Lora\" Alex Lora explained that this possible \"inclusion of American bands\" was going to be a surprise visit by Santana.\n\nSports promoter Justino Compean and Radio Juventud General Manager Ramiro Garza made a deal with then Coca-Cola Company Marketing Director, Vicente Fox Quezada, to sponsor the live broadcasting.\n\nHéctor Yaber from Telesistema Mexicano was in charge of the lighting system and Gustavo Cota from the company Audiorama S.A. of the PA system. All equipments were transported by the company Mudanzas Galván of José C. Galván Castro.\n\nThe security was going to be in charge of the State of Mexico's Judicial Police chief Cuauhtémoc Cardenas, who was going to receive support from 200 state troopers, 120 army troops and 50 Special Agents from the Secretariat of the Interior. Nevertheless, reports of the total amount of security agents were mixed.\"Variety\" reported a total of 700 law-enforcement agents.\n\nThe festival president Eduardo Lopez Negrete and Valle de Bravo's then-mayor Juan Montes de Oca Loza agreed that no liquor was going to be sold. Beer would be sold only with a meal. In an in-depth radio/video interview with radio host Rafael Catana, Armando Molina stated that mayor Montes de Oca suggested to Valle de Bravo's inhabitants to be polite with the hippie crowd as they felt being overwhelmed by the excessive numbers of them. In the end, not a single Valle de Bravo inhabitant complained about the hippies.\n\nEarly Saturday morning it was decided, as stated by Alfonso Lopez Negrete, in an on-site interview made by a Telesistema Mexicano, to cancel the auto race due to the quantity of festival attendees which surpassed all expectations.\n\nThe \"Circuito Avandaro\" auto-race was going to be suspended for decades to come since authorities tied the sport with massive crowds.\n\nAs stated by Armando Nava, Alex Lora and De Llano in the \"Memorias de un cierto dia: Avandaro\" documentary, tens of thousands of jipitecas were already on-site so activities started September 9 (Thursday) with special shows and even some brief concerts some bands like El Amor, Dug Dug's and Three Souls in my Mind offered while at the same time doing their sound-check for Saturday. By Saturday 11 at 6AM, hundreds of thousands of attendees were already on-site so Molina and De Llano decided to formally start the festival with a \"Pre-festival\". The acts which performed were:\n\n\nLa Fachada de Piedra concluded their act at approx. 5pm. After a brief pause the festival resumed as follows:\n\nAt around Sunday 9am, Three Souls in my Mind finished their act and the massive exodus started.\n\nAs stated by Armando Molina in the official soundtrack (narration part) and by his then assistant Jaime Almeida, the whole festival was held in peace with the only problem being that the attendees destroyed the barricade and invaded reserved areas of the light towers and even the stage. In the official soundtrack desperate calls for order from Molina's assistant Roberto Naranjo and band members from \"Dug Dug's\", \"El Epilogo\", and \"Peace and Love\" can be heard. At one point, an attendee fainted and Tequila's world-class Mexican-American singer, Maricela Durazo, ordered the crowd to take good care and protect her. As many thousands of jipitecas were on-site since Friday 10, co-organizer Luis de Llano stated the famous phrase: \"They survived for three days sharing rain and mud; that was in attempt to have an identity.\"\n\nFrancisco Martinez Gallardo, chief of the medical team and voluntaries of the improvised in-site hospital stated: \"There was one case of acute appendicitis, 20 intoxicated with pills, 50 with marijuana, 5 with alcoholic congestion, 5 cases of gastroenteritis and some with wounded heads, ankle fractures and burns.\"\n\nPresident Luis Echeverria agreed to send 300 buses to pick up some of the attendees. The news were cheered with a rarely seen approval for a Mexican president from his country's youth. As one of the organizers yelled, with heavy use of slangs, through the audio system:\n\"Lets cheer up Luis Echeverria, who is gonna send 300 buses of 50 seats each so we can go back...is a good guy that fella\" (un aplauso para Luis Echeverría que nos va a mandar 300 camiones de 50 pasajeros para el regreso ... a todo dar el chavo ese).\nAs can be seen in the Gurrola film, thousands upon thousands of hippies were walking from the site and many of them were overwhelming the buses.\n\nAs can be heard in the soundtrack, the band \"Peace and Love\" performed the songs \"Marihuana\" and \"We got the power,\" that were considered controversial to Mexican society. At the same time, Peace and Love front-man Ricardo Ochoa used some foul language in order to cheer up the crowd, echoing what Country Joe McDonald did at Woodstock. Since the festival was being broadcast live through \"Radio Juventud\" and relay stations all over the country, some segments of society took this as a direct threat to the establishment (\"Marihuana\" for advocating open drug-use and \"We got the power\" for wrongly associating it with a possible popular uprising). The possible association of jipitecas with subversive and radical political movements is what caused the so-called \"Avandarazo\".\n\nIn the aftermath of the post-festival turmoil, several interviewed Avandaro attendees declared that the whole festival was held in peace and not a single major accident happened but Moya Palencia, then Secretary of the Interior, accused the organizers of acting with intent and Carlos Hank González, then governor of the State of Mexico, condemned the festival's organizers and in his own defense stated that \"They were given permission to perform a sporting event, but instead presented a rock festival\" but, as stated by , his political opponents took this as an opportunity to destroy his presidential aspirations.\n\nOpinions from the world of politics, religion and academia were deeply divided.\nWhile influential university professors and La Onda writers such as and José Agustín, mostly gave the festival a positive review, and some intellectuals like Paco Ignacio Taibo I, Elena Poniatowska (herself an attendee), Octavio Paz and José Emilio Pacheco gave a fairly positive evaluation too, others criticized it negatively like and Eduardo \"Rius\" del Rio. Writer and political activist Carlos Monsiváis initially gave the festival a negative review but changed his mind soon afterwards. As Guadalajara Cardinal José Garibi y Rivera condemned it, popular liberal priest and festival attendee Enrique Marroquin praised it, publishing in Piedra Rodante a controversial article in its defense called \"God wants the rain so we can unite.\" There was also a notable incident at La Profesa, when during mass in homage to Mexico's Independence figure Agustin de Iturbide, a group of about 250 individuals belonging to a conservative civil movement left the building in protest as mass was being served by Monsignor Rafael Vazquez Corona, a strong supporter of the festival. Monsignor Vazquez Corona was then heavily criticized by then rector of the University of Guadalajara, Dr. Garibay Gutiérrez, in his 1972 book about the festival \"El gran desafio: Volver a pensar\".\n\nUnion leader Fidel Velazquez simply called the festival \"a Bacchanalia\", Attorney General labelled it as a \"witches' Sabbath\" and President of the Senate, Enrique Olivares Santana, yelled in a press conference: \"Let there be no more Avandaros in the republic!\". Finally and under pressure, president Luis Echeverría made a strong statement against the festival, saying: \"While we regret and condemn the phenomenon of Avándaro, it also encourages us in our belief that only a small part of our youth are in favor of such acts and entertainment.\"\n\nPresident Echeverria then proceeded to crack down La Onda. Some early 1970s hit-songs like \"Avandaro\" from Rosario, \"Seguir al sol\" by Pajaro Alberto and others which commemorated the event, were banned from radio air play, Radio Juventud DJs Félix Ruano Mendez, Jaime Marin and Agustín Meza de la Peña were temporarily suspended but, contrary to popular belief, they were not terminated. On the other hand, the influential Piedra Rodante magazine was indeed terminated in early 1972 and festival co-organizer Justino Compean left the country for a while.\n\nThe band Tinta Blanca and other rock musicians tried unsuccessfully to hold a meeting with president Echeverria with a famous protest outside Los Pinos. After a short time the protest was peacefully dissolved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2009 and then in May 2014, Luis de Llano, of Televisa, formally announced that he was preparing a soap opera with the Avándaro festival as its background.\n\n\n\n\nAmong many others, the most notorious ones were:\n\n\n\nIn spite the spirit of the age and that many people were completely naked swimming in the lake, walking in the middle of the crowd or even on stage without a problem as can be seen in the film, one woman, as the band La Division del Norte was playing, performed a striptease and caught the attention of the cameras. Her strip-tease was captured in the Gurrola film and shots of her appeared in many other media. When the footage and pictures were shown, the public baptized the woman as \"La encuerada\"(the naked woman). The woman was interviewed on-site by Elena Poniatowska; however, another interview, thought to have been real for decades, was published in the rock magazine \"Piedra Rodante\" in late 1971. In 2001, a bitter dispute between the owner of \"Piedra Rodante\" Manuel Aceves and then collaborator and music critic Oscar Sarquiz about the veracity of the interview took place in \"La Jornada\" newspaper. Finally, it was confirmed by Federico Rubli and further explained in the TV Azteca documentary that the interview was completely bogus.\nA few years after the festival the band Three Souls in my Mind composed a song called \"La encuerada de Avandaro\" which would become a hit in the underground movement.\n\nShot by Telesistema Mexicano cameramen under direction of Carlos Alazraki, those tapes were destined to become part of the planned TV special but were confiscated by their own company as soon as Luis de Llano showed up for work. Some footage of these tapes has been released since 1971 in movies and documentaries. In a 2001 interview, Luis de Llano recalled this situation and stated that may he find the tapes he will produce a movie with them though it is widely believed that they were sent to a storage in Tijuana, and that years later the whole place burnt out. He also made clear that, contrary to popular belief, the Secretariat of the Interior did not confiscate the tapes. An independent investigation, as shown in the \"Las glorias de Avandaro\" documentary, made as a request through the Federal Institute of access to information () produced the official document proving that, indeed, the government did not confiscate the tapes.\n\n\n\nThe festival remains a controversial issue in Mexican society. After the festival, Mexican rock music was almost banned and was segregated to the so-called \"Hoyos Funkies\", illegal gatherings in abandoned warehouses and supported mostly by the proletariat. A few years after the festival the hippie movement around the world collapsed and Mexico's La Onda was no exception, giving way to the ascension of other music genres of the mid-1970s such as Disco, Urban rock, Punk, Romantic Ballads, Heavy Metal, Progressive rock and, exclusively in the Mexican scene, the \"Rupestre movement\" championed by Rockdrigo Gonzalez.\n\nThe world-class quality of the bands that participated is generally praised and while the festival is little by little being acknowledged by official publications from respected institutions such as INEGI and COLMEX is still not completely accepted as part of the official Mexican history class, but it's often regarded as a milestone in the history of rock music, the hippie movement and post-WWII Mexican society in general.\n\nPhotographer Pedro Meyer, himself an Avandaro attendee, produced a collection named \"Avandaro 1971\", available online.\n\nIn 2016, the Museo Universitario del Chopo in Mexico City, exhibited a collection of Avandaro photographs taken by Graciela Iturbide.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39353050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39353050", "title": "International Workers' Day", "text": "International Workers' Day\n\nInternational Workers' Day, also known as Workers' Day, May Day or Labour Day in some countries and often referred to as May Day, is a celebration of labourers and the working classes that is promoted by the international labour movement which occurs every year on May Day (1 May), an ancient European spring festival.\n\nThe date was chosen by a pan-national organization of socialist and communist political parties to commemorate the Haymarket affair, which occurred in Chicago on 4 May 1886. The 1904 Sixth Conference of the Second International, called on \"all Social Democratic Party organisations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on the First of May for the legal establishment of the 8-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace.\"\n\nThe first of May is a national public holiday in many countries worldwide, in most cases as \"Labour Day\", \"International Workers' Day\" or some similar name – although some countries celebrate a Labour Day on other dates significant to them, such as the United States, which celebrates Labor Day on the first Monday of September.\n\nBeginning in the late 19th century, as the trade union and labour movements grew, a variety of days were chosen by trade unionists as a day to celebrate labour. In the United States and Canada, a September holiday, called Labor or Labour Day, was first proposed in the 1880s. In 1882, Matthew Maguire, a machinist, first proposed a Labor Day holiday on the first Monday of September while serving as secretary of the Central Labor Union (CLU) of New York. Others argue that it was first proposed by Peter J. McGuire of the American Federation of Labor in May 1882, after witnessing the annual labour festival held in Toronto, Canada. In 1887, Oregon was the first state of the United States to make it an official public holiday. By the time it became an official federal holiday in 1894, thirty US states officially celebrated Labor Day. Thus by 1887 in North America, Labour Day was an established, official holiday but in September, not on 1 May.\n\n1 May was chosen to be International Workers' Day to commemorate the 1886 Haymarket affair in Chicago. In that year beginning on 1 May, there was a general strike for the eight-hour workday. On 4 May, the police acted to disperse a public assembly in support of the strike when an unidentified person threw a bomb. The police responded by firing on the workers. The event lead to the death of eight and injury of sixty police officers as well as an unknown number of civilian killed or wounded. Hundreds of labour leaders and sympathizers were later rounded-up and four were executed by hanging, after a trial that was seen as a miscarriage of justice. The following day on 5 May in Milwaukee Wisconsin, the state militia fired on a crowd of strikers killing seven, including a schoolboy and a man feeding chickens in his yard.\n\nIn 1889, a meeting in Paris was held by the first congress of the Second International, following a proposal by Raymond Lavigne that called for international demonstrations on the 1890 anniversary of the Chicago protests. May Day was formally recognized as an annual event at the International's second congress in 1891. Subsequently, the May Day riots of 1894 occurred. The International Socialist Congress, Amsterdam 1904 called on \"all Social Democratic Party organisations and trade unions of all countries to demonstrate energetically on the First of May for the legal establishment of the 8-hour day, for the class demands of the proletariat, and for universal peace.\" The congress made it \"mandatory upon the proletarian organisations of all countries to stop work on 1 May, wherever it is possible without injury to the workers.\"\n\nMay Day has been a focal point for demonstrations by various socialist, communist and anarchist groups since the Second International. May Day is one of the most important holidays in communist countries such as the People's Republic of China, North Korea, Cuba and the former Soviet Union countries. May Day celebrations in these countries typically feature elaborate workforce parades, including displays of military hardware and soldiers.\n\nIn 1955, the Catholic Church dedicated 1 May to \"Saint Joseph the Worker\". Saint Joseph is the patron saint of workers and craftsmen, among others.\n\nDuring the Cold War, May Day became the occasion for large military parades in Red Square by the Soviet Union and attended by the top leaders of the Kremlin, especially the Politburo, atop Lenin's Mausoleum. It became an enduring symbol of that period.\n\nToday, the majority of countries around the world celebrate a workers' day on 1 May.\n\nIn Algeria, 1 May is a public holiday. 1 May is celebrated in Algeria as Labour Day and has been a paid bank holiday since 1962.\n\n1 May is known as Labour Day and is considered a paid holiday. The President of Egypt traditionally presides over the official May Day celebrations in Cairo.\n\nIn Ethiopia, 1 May is a public holiday and celebrated as the Worker's Day.\n\n1 May is a holiday in Ghana. It is a day to celebrate all workers across the country. It is celebrated with a parade by trade unions and labour associations. The parades are normally addressed by the Secretary General of the trade union congress and by regional secretaries in the regions. Workers from different workplaces through banners and T-shirts identify their companies.\n\nIn Kenya, 1 May is a public holiday and celebrated as the Labour Day. It is a big day addressed by the leaders of the workers' umbrella union body - Central Organisation of Trade Unions COTU. The Minister for Labour (and occasionally the President) address the workers. Each year, the government approves (and increases) the minimum wage on Labour Day.\n\nInternational Workers' Day was declared a national public holiday by the National Transitional Council in 2012 the first year of the post-Qaddafi era.\n\nOn 1 May 1978, then Libyan leader Colonel Mu'ammar Al-Qaddafi addressed the nation in the capital city of Tripoli calling for administrative and also economic reforms across Libya.\n\nIt is recognized as a public holiday on 1 May.\n\nCelebrates workers day on 1 May.\n\nEvery 1 May, workers in Nigeria converge at the stadium to commemorate this public holiday. It is a recognized holiday all workers must observe. On that day the president of the Nigeria Labour Congress addresses workers and this has been a tradition for decades.\n\nIn Somalia, 1 May is a public holiday and celebrated as the Labour Day.\n\nIn South Africa, Workers' Day has been celebrated as a national public holiday on 1 May each year since 1994. It has its origins within the historical struggles of workers and their trade unions internationally for solidarity between working people in their struggles to win fair employment standards and more importantly, to establish a culture of human and worker rights and to ensure that these are enshrined in international law and the national law of those countries aligned to the International Labour Organization. In pre-1994 South Africa, the demand for the annual observance of the day as a public holiday became a rallying point for workers and their trade unions and was one of a number of annually significant days to symbolize and mobilize resistance to the Apartheid government and its racial policies.\n\nIn Tanzania, it is a public holiday on 1 May and celebrated as the Workers' Day.\n\n1 May is recognized as Labour Day within Tunisia.\n\nIn Uganda, Labour Day is a public holiday on 1 May.\n\n1 May is recognized as public holiday in Zimbabwe. If the date is Sunday in that year, the following Monday is a holiday.\n\nIn Argentina, Workers' Day is an official holiday, and is frequently associated with the labour unions. Celebrations related to labour are held, including demonstrations in major cities. It is customary to organize meetings at friends' places, at the sports associations, at the workplace, or at the labour unions with local food, usually locro or asado.\n\nThe first Workers' Day celebration was in 1890, when Argentinian unions, controlled in those days by socialists and anarchists, organized several joint celebrations in Buenos Aires and other cities, at the same time that the international labour movement celebrated it for the first time. In 1930, it was established as an official holiday by the first president elected after the passage of the Sáenz Peña Law, the Radical Civic Union president Hipólito Yrigoyen. The day became particularly relevant during the worker-oriented government of Juan Domingo Perón (1946–55). He permitted and endorsed national recognition of the holiday during his tenure in office.\n\n1 May is known as Labour Day and is a holiday.\n\nIn Brazil, Workers' Day is an official holiday that is celebrated on the 1st of May, and unions commemorate it with day-long public events. It is also when salaries for most professional categories and the minimum wage are traditionally readjusted.\n\nIn Canada, Labour Day is celebrated in September. In 1894, the government of Prime Minister John Sparrow David Thompson declared the first Monday in September as Canada's official Labour Day. Labor Day in the United States is on the same day.\n\nMay Day is however marked by unions and leftists. It is celebrated on the 1st of May. May Day is an important day of trade union and community group protest in the province of Quebec (though not a provincial state holiday). Celebration of the International Labour Day (or \"International Workers' Day\"; ) in Montreal goes back to 1906, organized by the Mutual Aid circle. The tradition had a renaissance at the time of a mass strike in 1972. On the 1973 May Day, the first contemporary demonstration was organized by the major trade union confederations; over 30,000 trade unionists took part in this demonstration. Further, it is the customary date on which the minimum wage rises.\n\nPresident Carlos Ibáñez del Campo decreed 1 May a national holiday in 1931, in honour of the dignity of workers. All stores and public services must close for the entire day, and the major trade unions of Chile, represented in the national organization Workers' United Center of Chile (Central Unitaria de Trabajadores), organize rallies during the morning hours, with festivities and cookouts in the later part of the day, in all the major cities of Chile. During these rallies, representatives of the major left-wing political parties speak to the assemblies on the issues of the day concerning workers’ rights.\n\n1 May has long been recognized as Labour Day and almost all workers respect it as a national holiday. As in many other countries, it is common to see rallies by the trade unions in all over the main regional capitals of the country.\n\nIt is recognized as a public holiday, and at the same time an important day for government activities. On this day the President of Costa Rica gives a speech to the citizens and the legislature of Costa Rica about the duties that were undertaken through the previous year. The president of the legislature is also chosen by its members.\n\nThis day is known as Labour Day in Cuba. People march in the streets, showing their support to the Cuban Communist government and the Cuban Revolution during the whole morning.\n\n1 May is a national holiday known as Labour Day and celebrated by workers' parades and demonstration.\n\nIt is an official holiday and it is commemorated with parades.\n\n1 May is an official public holiday known as Labour Day.\n\n1 May is an official public holiday known as Agriculture and Labour Day.\n\n1 May is an official holiday, known as \"Labour Day\" within Honduras.\n\n1 May is a federal holiday.

In 1921, following the Russian Revolution of 1917, 1 May was promoted as \"Americanization Day\" by the Veterans of Foreign Wars and other groups in opposition to communism. It became an annual event, sometimes featuring large rallies. In 1949, Americanization Day was renamed to Loyalty Day. In 1958, the US Congress declared Loyalty Day, the US recognition of 1 May, a national holiday; that same year, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed 1 May Law Day as well.\nUnions and radical organizations including anarchist groups and socialist and communist parties have kept the international May Day tradition alive with rallies and demonstrations. In 1919 the left mounted especially large demonstrations, and violence greeted the normally peaceful parades in Boston, New York, and Cleveland and a number of people were killed. In Milwaukee, an annual commemoration takes place at the site of the killing of seven workers during an 8 hour march. Some of the largest examples of this occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when hundreds of thousands of workers marched in May Day parades in New York's Union Square. While cities like Chicago and Duluth saw large demonstrations organized by the communist party. \nIn 2006, 1 May was chosen by mostly Latino immigrant groups in the United States as the day for the Great American Boycott, a general strike of undocumented immigrant workers and supporters to protest H.R. 4437, immigration reform legislation that they felt was draconian.\nFrom 10 April to 1 May of that year, millions of immigrant families in the US called for immigrant rights, workers' rights and amnesty for undocumented workers. They were joined by socialist and other leftist organizations on 1 May. On 1 May 2007, a mostly peaceful demonstration in Los Angeles in support of undocumented immigrant workers ended with a widely televised dispersal by police officers. In March 2008, the International Longshore and Warehouse Union announced that dockworkers will move no cargo at any West Coast ports on 1 May 2008, as a protest against the continuation of the Iraq War and the diversion of resources from domestic needs.\n\nOn 1 May 2012, members of Occupy Wall Street and labour unions held protests together in a number of cities in the United States and Canada to commemorate May Day and to protest the state of the economy and economic inequality.\n\nOn 1 May 2017, immigrants' rights advocates, labor unions and leftists held protests against the immigration and economic policies of President Donald Trump in cities throughout the US, Chicago and Los Angeles having some of the larger marches.\n\nIn Uruguay, 1 May – Workers' Day – is an official holiday. Even when it is associated with labour unions, almost all workers tend to respect it. Since the late 1990s, the main event takes place at the First of May Square in Montevideo.\n\n1 May is an official holiday in Venezuela. is celebrated on 1 May in Venezuela since 1936, but from 1938 to 1945 it was held on 24 July, by an order of Eleazar López Contreras. However, Isaías Medina Angarita changed it back to 1 May in 1945.\n\nIn Bahrain, 1 May is known as Labour Day and is a public holiday.\n\nIn Bangladesh, May Day is a government holiday.

Prior to 2008, it was a three-day holiday, but is now just the one day. However, it is usually supplemented by two other days to give the appearance of a three-day holiday, but not being statutory holidays the extra days have to be \"made up\" by working either the preceding or following weekend. For example, in 2013, 1 May fell on Wednesday. Most workplaces, including all government offices, took Monday 29 April, Tuesday 30 April, and Wednesday 1 May off. As the first two days were not statutory holidays they had to be \"made up\" by working the preceding weekend (27 and 28 April).\n\nIn Hong Kong, 1 May is known as Labour Day and has been considered a public holiday since 1999.\n\nIn India, Labour Day is a public holiday held on every 1 May. It is celebrated as Antarrashtriya Shramik Diwas. The holiday is tied to labour movements for communist and socialist political parties. Labour Day is known as \"Kamgar Din\" in Hindi, \"Karmikara Dinacharane\" in Kannada,\"Karmika Dinotsavam in Telugu, \"Kamgar Divas\" in Marathi, \"Uzhaipalar dhinam\" in Tamil,\"Thozhilaali Dinam\" in Malayalamand Shromik Divas in ((Bengali)). In North India, and Labour Day is mostly not given its previous importance as a holiday now.\n\nThe first May Day celebration in India was organized in Madras (now Chennai) by the Labour Kisan Party of Hindustan on 1 May 1923. This was also the first time the red flag was used in India. The party leader Singaravelu Chettiar made arrangements to celebrate May Day in two places in 1923. One meeting was held at the beach opposite to the Madras High Court; the other meeting was held at the Triplicane beach. \"The Hindu\" newspaper, published from Madras reported,\n\nThe Labour Kisan party has introduced May Day celebrations in Madras. Comrade Singaravelar presided over the meeting. A resolution was passed stating that the government should declare May Day as a holiday. The president of the party explained the non-violent principles of the party. There was a request for financial aid. It was emphasised that workers of the world must unite to achieve independence.\n\n1 May is also celebrated as \"Maharashtra Day\" and \"Gujarat Day\" to mark the date in 1960, when the two western states attained statehood after the erstwhile Bombay State was divided on linguistic lines. Maharashtra Day is held at Shivaji Park in central Mumbai. Schools and offices in Maharashtra remain closed on 1 May. A similar parade is held to celebrate Gujarat Day in Gandhinagar.\n\nVaiko (Vai Gopalsamy), General Secretary of Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, appealed to the then Prime Minister V. P. Singh to declare 1 May as a national holiday, to which the PM heeded and from then on it became a national holiday to celebrate International Labour Day.\n\nMay Day (often referred locally as Labour Day) in Indonesia was first observed as a public holiday from 2014. Every year on the day, labourers take over the streets in major cities across the country, voicing their demands for better income & a supportive policy by the ministries.\n\nIn Iran, 1 May is known as the International Workers' Day.

Still, demonstrations continued with small crowds, and in 1996, three people were killed by police bullets, and a plain-clothes man who spied in the crowd was revealed and lynched by workers. On the same evening, a video broadcast on TV showed that two participants in the demonstration were lynched by far right-wing nationalist groups and this lynching occurred in front of police forces who were watching the scene with happy faces.

When such fads and sensations occur online, they tend to grow rapidly and become more widespread because the instant communication facilitates word of mouth.\n\nThe world's first Internet sensation met the Internet in 1995 when Ty, Inc. introduced Beanie Babies to the online world. The toy craze was aligned with the growth of the Internet. At the time, the Internet was primarily used on college campuses for research. A college student, named Lina Trivedi, who worked for Ty, Inc. introduced the toy company's President, Ty Warner, to the concept of the Internet. Warner devoted resources into research and development of the Beanie Babies Web site and Trivedi developed the first business to consumer Website ever created. Very quickly, the collectability of Beanie Babies grew exponentially as collectors were now able to see all the Beanie Babies that were available on the Internet, as well as new releases that were coming out, and which Beanie Babies were retiring. Ultimately, the Internet fueled the Beanie Babies phenomenon.\n\nThis resulted in Beanie Babies evolving into an instant collectible market that spawned thousands of Websites specifically designed to chronicle these toys. Beanie Babies grew in popularity quicker than any other phenomenon prior to its time due to the instant nature of the Internet. Crazes prior to Beanie Babies took years to gain traction, however Beanie Babies were able to become a worldwide phenomenon within months due to the ability of people to create Web pages and share information on the Internet. Beanie Babies were the first worldwide craze fueled by the Internet. After seeing announcements on the Internet, people would line up at mall shops with their gates still down in hopes to get the most valuable Beanie Babies. Many were buying and then trading these toys through Internet Websites for hundreds of dollars and building collections of toys that were exceeding $100,000 in value. At the height of the craze, Beanie Babies accounted for 10% of all sales on eBay and Ty Warner, creator of Beanie Babies, became a billionaire.\n\n\n\nThese generally feature Internet users recording themselves taking a challenge and then distributing the resulting video through social media sites, often inspiring or daring other users to repeat the challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to its scientific role, the Luna 26 orbiter would also function as a telecomm relay between Earth and Russian landed assets. This mission was announced in November 2014, and its launch is planned for 2022 on a Soyuz-2 rocket.\n\nThe Luna 26 orbiter mission has been in planning since at least 2011. Originally it was envisioned to be launched to the Moon together with the lunar lander Luna 27 which will land on the South Pole–Aitken basin, an unexplored area on the far side of the Moon, but because of mass limitations, they will be launched separately. The orbiter's mass is about 2,100 kg.\n\nThe objective of the orbiter is to locate and quantify usable resources and materials that can be exploited by future landed missions. After completion of its primary mission, the spacecraft's orbit will be raised to about 500 km altitude to study cosmic rays.\n\nThe European Space Agency(ESA) will contribute to this and other Luna-Glob missions in the manner of communications, precision landing, hazard avoidance, drilling, sampling, sample analysis and ground support. As of October 2017, the USA space agency NASA is negotiating and assessing a potential collaboration with the Luna-Glob missions Luna 25 through Luna 28.\n\nThe scientific payload on board the orbiter is composed of fourteen instruments that will be fabricated by Russia and by some European partners. The payload will study the lunar surface and the environment around the Moon, including the solar wind, and high-energy cosmic rays. The orbiter may carry some NASA instruments, or instruments from private USA companies. Luna 26 will also scout sites for the next Luna 27 landing mission.\n\n"}

J. Phipps, it was built by the producer Henry Leslie with profits from the Alfred Cellier and B. C. Stephenson hit, \"Dorothy\" (he made £100,000 from this opera), which he transferred from the Prince of Wales Theatre to open his new venue on 17 December 1888. It was the second theatre to be constructed on this stretch of Shaftesbury Avenue and is now the oldest in the street. The foyer and bars were refurbished in 1932–33, and the facade was restored in 1994. At present it seats 915 on four levels, although originally it was designed with a seating capacity of 1,306.\n\nEarly in the theatre's history, it staged mostly comic operas, and later it has been a home to light comedies, musicals and straight dramas.\n\nThe theatre retains many of its original features (including being built behind an original 1767 house front, at the rear to Great Windmill Street, the former house and museum of Sir William Hunter) and the theatre was Grade II listed by English Heritage in September 1960.\n\nThe Lyric Theatre still uses water to operate its iron curtain. Water was originally pumped from the river Thames to West End theatres and hotels and used to hydraulically operate heavy machinery like lifts. Hydraulic pressure is now provided by electric pump, but it can also be operated manually by two people.\n\nThe Lyric Theatre has been owned by Nimax Theatres since 2005 when Nica Burns and Max Weitzenhoffer purchased it from the Really Useful Group (establishing the new Nimax group with the Apollo Theatre, Garrick Theatre and Duchess Theatre).\n\n\n\n"}

The festival occurs between late April into June annually, typically with four operas.\n\nIn April 1933, Vittorio Gui founded the festival, with the aim of presenting contemporary and forgotten operas in visually dramatic productions. It was the first music festival in Italy. The first opera presented was Verdi's early \"Nabucco\", his early operas then being rarely staged. The first festival's success, which included two performances of Spontini's \"La Vestale\" with Rosa Ponselle, led to it becoming a biennial event in 1937 with the presentation of nine operas. After 1937, it became an annual festival, except during World War II. Performances took place in the Teatro Comunale and Piccolo Teatro, plus the Teatro della Pergola. A new opera house, the Teatro dell'Opera di Firenze, was inaugurated in 2011 and permanently replaced the former Teatro Comunale in 2014.\n\nFormer musical directors were Vittorio Gui (1928-1936), Mario Rossi (1937-1946), Bruno Bartoletti (1957-1964), and Riccardo Muti (1969-1981). Zubin Mehta became principal conductor in 1985, and now has the title of honorary conductor for life. In January 2016, the Opera di Firenze announced the appointment of Fabio Luisi as music director of the festival, the first conductor to hold that title, as of April 2018, with an initial contract of 5 years.\n\nIn 2009, due to government funding cuts, two of the four operas (\"Billy Budd\" and \"Macbeth\") were cancelled.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "236321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=236321", "title": "Micromanagement", "text": "Micromanagement\n\nIn business management, micromanagement is a management style whereby a manager closely observes and/or controls the work of his/her subordinates or employees. \n\nMicromanagement is generally considered to have a negative connotation, mainly due to the fact that it shows a lack of freedom in the workplace.\n\nMerriam-Webster's Online Dictionary defines micromanagement as \"manage[ment] especially with excessive control or attention on details\". Dictionary.com defines micromanagement as \"manage[ment] or control with excessive attention to minor details\". The online dictionary Encarta defined micromanagement as \"atten[tion] to small details in management: control [of] a person or a situation by paying extreme attention to small details\".\n\nThe notion of micromanagement can be extended to any social context where one person takes a bully approach in the level of control and influence over the members of a group. Often, this excessive obsession with the most minute of details causes a direct management failure in the ability to focus on the major details.\n\nRather than giving general instructions on smaller tasks and then devoting time to supervising larger concerns, the micromanager monitors and assesses every step of a business process and avoids delegation of decisions. Micromanagers are usually irritated when a subordinate makes decisions without consulting them, even if the decisions are within the subordinate's level of authority.\n\nMicromanagement also frequently involves requests for unnecessary and overly detailed reports (\"reportomania\"). A micromanager tends to require constant and detailed performance feedback and to focus excessively on procedural trivia (often in detail greater than they can actually process) rather than on overall performance, quality and results. This focus on \"low-level\" trivia often delays decisions, clouds overall goals and objectives, restricts the flow of information between employees, and guides the various aspects of a project in different and often opposed directions. Many micromanagers accept such inefficiencies as less important than their retention of control or of the appearance of control.\n\nIt is common for micromanagers, especially those who exhibit narcissistic tendencies and/or micromanage deliberately and for strategic reasons, to delegate work to subordinates and then micromanage those subordinates' performance, enabling the micromanagers in question to both take credit for positive results and shift the blame for negative results to their subordinates. These micromanagers thereby delegate accountability for failure but not the authority to take alternative actions that would have led to success or at least to the mitigation of that failure.\n\nThe most extreme cases of micromanagement constitute a management pathology closely related to workplace bullying and narcissistic behavior. Micromanagement resembles addiction in that although most micromanagers are behaviorally dependent on control over others, both as a lifestyle and as a means of maintaining that lifestyle, many of them fail to recognize and acknowledge their dependence even when everyone around them observes it. Some severe cases of micromanagement arise from other underlying mental health conditions such as obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. (Renee Kowalski)\n\nAlthough micromanagement is often easily recognized by employees, micromanagers rarely view themselves as such. In a form of denial similar to that found in addictive behavior, micromanagers will often rebut allegations of micromanagement by offering a competing characterization of their management style such as \"structured\", \"organized\", or \"perfectionistic\".\n\nMicromanagement can be distinguished from the mere tendency of a manager to perform duties assigned to a subordinate. When a manager can perform a worker's job more efficiently than the worker can, the result is merely suboptimal management: although the company suffers lost opportunities because such managers would serve the company even better by doing their own job (see comparative advantage). In micromanagement, the manager not only tells a subordinate what to do but dictates that the job be done a certain way regardless of whether that way is the most effective or efficient one.\n\nThe most frequent motivations for micromanagement, such as detail-orientedness, emotional insecurity, and doubts regarding employees' competence, are internal and related to the personality of the manager. Since manager-employee relationships include a difference in power and often in age, workplace psychologists have used models based on transference theory to draw analogies between micromanagement relationships and dysfunctional parent-child relationships, \"e.g.\", that both often feature the frequent imposition of double binds and/or a tendency by the authority figure to exhibit hypercriticality. However, external factors such as organizational culture, severe or increased time or performance pressure, severe demands of the regulatory environment, and instability of managerial position (either specific to a micromanager's position or throughout an organization) may also play a role.\n\nIn many cases of micromanagement, managers select and implement processes and procedures not for business reasons but rather to enable themselves to feel useful and valuable and/or create the appearance of being so. A frequent cause of such micromanagement patterns is a manager's perception or fear that they lack the competence and creative capability necessary for their position in the larger corporate structure. In reaction to this fear, the manager creates a \"fiefdom\" within which the manager selects performance standards not on the basis of their relevance to the corporation's interest but rather on the basis of the ability of the manager's division to satisfy them.\n\nSuch motivations for micromanagement often intensify, at both the individual-manager and the organization-wide level, during times of economic hardship. In some cases, managers may have proper goals in mind but place disproportionate emphasis on the role of their division and/or on their own personal role in the furtherance of those goals. In others, managers throughout an organization may engage in behavior that, while protective of their division's interests or their personal interests, harms the organization as a whole.\n\nMicromanagement can also stem from a breakdown in the fundamentals of delegation. When a task or project is delegated in an unclear way, or where there is a lack of trust between the manager and the person doing the work, micromanagement naturally ensues. Clearer delegation, with a well defined goal, clear vision of the constraints and dependencies, and effective oversight, can help prevent micromanagement.\n\nLess frequently, micromanagement is a tactic consciously chosen for the purpose of eliminating unwanted employees: A micromanager may set unreachable standards later invoked as grounds for termination of those employees. These standards may be either specific to certain employees or generally applicable but selectively enforced only against particular employees. Alternatively, the micromanager may attempt by this or other means to create a stressful workplace in which the undesired employees no longer desire to participate. When such stress is severe or pervasive enough, its creation may be regarded as constructive discharge (also known in the United Kingdom as \"constructive dismissal\" and in the United States as \"constructive termination\").\n\nRegardless of a micromanager's motive for their conduct, its potential effects include:\n\nBecause a pattern of micromanagement suggests to employees that a manager does not trust their work or judgment, it is a major factor in triggering employee disengagement, often to the point of promoting a dysfunctional and hostile work environment in which one or more managers, or even management generally, are labeled \"control freaks.\" Disengaged employees invest time, but not effort or creativity, in the work in which they are assigned. The effects of this phenomenon are worse in situations where work is passed from one specialized employee to another. In such a situation, apathy among upstream employees affects not only their own productivity but also that of their downstream colleagues.\n\nSevere forms of micromanagement can completely eliminate trust, stifle opportunities for learning and development of interpersonal skills, and even provoke anti-social behavior. Micromanagers of this severity often rely on inducing fear in the employees to achieve more control and can severely affect self-esteem of employees as well as their mental and physical health. Occasionally, and especially when their micromanagement involves the suppression of constructive criticism that could otherwise lead to internal reform, severe micromanagers affect subordinates' mental and/or physical health to such an extreme that the subordinates' only way to change their workplace environment is to change employers or even leave the workplace despite lacking alternative job prospects (see constructive discharge, \"supra\").\n\nFinally, the detrimental effects of micromanagement can extend beyond the company itself, especially when the behavior becomes severe enough to force out skilled employees valuable to competitors. Current employees may complain about micromanagement in social settings or to friend-colleagues (\"e.g.\", classmates and/or former co-workers) affiliated with other firms in a field. Outside observers such as consultants, clients, interviewees, or visitors may notice the behavior and recount it in conversation with friends and/or colleagues. Most harmfully to the company, forced-out employees, especially those whose advanced skills have made them attractive to other companies and gained them immediate respect, may have few reservations about speaking frankly when answering questions about why they changed employers; they may even deliberately badmouth their former employer. The resulting damage to the company's reputation may create or increase insecurity among management, prompting further micromanagement among managers who use it to cope with insecurity; such a feedback effect creates and perpetuates a vicious cycle. It may follow the forced-out employee to the new job and create an environment of new micromanagement.\n\n\n"}

Started in 2013, the four-day festival runs Thursday through Sunday and is a collaborative community event with support from nearly 50 business and community sponsors as well as 400 volunteers. The festival concept was created by long-time community advocate and marketing executive Dave Willems and his team at Willems Marketing, Inc., located in downtown. Willems recruited then Nashville-based touring artist and Appleton hometowner Cory Chisel to join the founding team along with Willems' staff at his marketing firm, which specializes in community and non-profit projects.\n\nThe festival features original, handcrafted Americana music of varying styles – folk and indie rock to soul, alternative and country – with on average 225+ performers and nearly 1000 total performances. It's focus is on showcasing largely undiscovered, touring troubadours and bands with the mantra, \"artists you may not know but should.\" The festival is \"cover-free\", meaning no cover songs and no cover charges. Almost every show at the festival is free to the public.\n\nThe festival's success over the years has benefited the local community, through significant creative economy impact as well as local youth music education and other scholarships.\n\nThe festival has spawned its own beer, the Americana Pale Ale by Stone Arch Brew House, a local brewery in the area.\n\nThe festival changes with each year, as it introduces more venues, and adds more charity events. The event is modeled after other music festivals, most notably South by Southwest in Austin, Texas.\n\n\nThe inaugural year of the festival had over 220 performances in 40 venues. The 107 musical acts included Rodney Crowell, Justin Townes Earle, Cory Chisel, Hillary Reynolds Band, Nicole Atkins, The Candles and an unofficial appearance by Norah Jones.\n\n\nThe Mile of Music's sophomore year had more than 60 venues, had more than 200 performers, and had 625 live performances. There were three 'main' stages for the festival, Lawrence University’s Memorial Chapel, and outdoor stages at Houdini Plaza and Jones Park. The festival generated nearly $2 million in economic development for the community. The four-day event featured Americana and Roots music.\n\nMusical acts included performances by event co-founder and Appleton home-towner, Cory Chisel, The Autumn Defense, Sturgill Simpson, The Baseball Project and Butch Vig playing with The Emperors of Wyoming. Richie Ramone made a special guest appearance. Brooklyn-based Swear and Shake also returned for a surprise Mystery Music Stage performance at Lawrence University’s Stansbury Theatre. The Milk Carton Kids were scheduled to headline but cancelled. They were replaced by an outlaw-themed show including Cory Chisel, Langhorne Slim and Ruby Amanfu.\n\nNew attractions included the Mile of Music Bus, which festival goers could board to hear live music from performers and pop-up performances along the mile-long stretch of Downtown Appleton. An expanded family-friendly music education series was also featured with over 30 events and workshops that offered different interactive experiences including bucket drumming and Balinese Gamelan. These events also included educators from the Appleton Area School District and Lawrence University.\n\nThis was the first year that the Mile of Music app was released for smartphones.\n\n\nThe festival officially began on Thursday Aug. 6th, but a 'First Songs' concert was held the night before at the Fox Cities Performing Arts Center. The festival ended with a special concert called \"Songs Before We Go,\" which was held at the Lawrence Memorial Chapel.\n\nMusicians who partook in 2015 included The Milk Carton Kids, Roadkill Ghost Choir, Tim Barry, Swear and Shake, Wild Adriatic, Cory Chisel, The Suitcase Junket, The Crane Wives, Water Liars and Motherfolk.\n\nAs in the previous year, main stages were situated in the Memorial Chapel on Lawrence University's campus, and outdoor stages at the downtown Houdini Plaza and Jones Park. Some outdoor shows had to be moved indoors due to rain.\n\nMore than 225 artists participated in 750 performances. Live music sets were held in more than 60 venues on or near College Avenue and along the riverfront.\n\n\n240 bands and troubadours performed 904 sets in the 2016 festival and included Aaron Lee Tasjan, Cory Chisel, Wild Adriatic, Jamie Kent and Kristin Diable.\n\nMain stages were at the Lawrence Memorial Chapel, Houdini Plaza (outdoor), the OuterEdge Stage (indoor) and Jones Park (outdoor).\n\nMore than 65 Downtown Appleton venues participated in the 2016 festival. \n\nMile of Music also hosted its first-ever hip-hop showcase at Lawrence University's Stansbury Theatre. \n\n\nThe 2017 festival featured 70 Downtown Appleton venues that hosted 950 live music sets from 250 artists. \n\nMain stages included the Lawrence Memorial Chapel, Houdini Plaza, The OuterEdge Stage. Jones Park is under construction and will return for the 2019 festival. Washington Square served as a \"replacement\" for the park and became a popular venue. Festival organizers plan to utilize it as a permanent addition to the festival.\n\nArtist included San Fermin, Ron Gallo, Bishop Gunn, Traveler, Tenement and Dan Rodriguez.\n"}

Philadelphia was America's second-largest city, a thriving industrial center, and a vital force in the American economy. The city also remained major transportation hub and gateway to America and Pennsylvania's industrial empire. Though only a fraction-no more than 5 percent-of the people who immigrated to the United States during those years, the newcomers who entered through Philadelphia represented every ethnic and religious group that comprised America's so-called \"New Immigrants\" who arrived between the 1880s and the outbreak of the First World War. In 1882 there was the great migration from Russia of Jewish migrants to Philadelphia that settled in the Pennsport neighborhood during this time period and many suffered from a severe lack of medical services. Numerous organizations failed in instituting a medical facility to aid these immigrants in the neighborhood. Ultimately, at the turn of the Twentieth Century, the Beth Israel Hospital Association was established in order to solve the problem. This establishment successfully treated the area’s poor Jewish population and also accepted patients from other faiths. Beth Israel was absorbed by the Franklin Free Dispensary only a few months after beginning their operation. At around the same time, Jewish physicians opened their Mount Sinai Dispensary in Society Hill, however because of their common goal, both dispensaries, Franklin Free and Mount Sinai, agreed to merge and renamed themselves the Mount Sinai Hospital Association.\n\nPhiladelphia city laws stated that hospitals treating consumptives (now known as Tuberculosis) or immigrants, could not be built near homes and churches. The Mount Sinai Hospital Association considered building the facility outside of the city however they knew that it had to be built near where patients lived. By 1904, the law was amended after lobbying the city government and the association procured an old lumber yard on the 1400 block of South 5th Street, central to the Pennsport neighborhood, that was the most in need. The $25,000 purchase included the yard’s four-story building (built in 1893), which would become the first Mount Sinai Hospital. In March of 1905, Mount Sinai Hospital officially opened to the public and accepted its first patients.\n"}

His body was found away in the Vologne River near Docelles. The case became known as the Grégory Affair () and for decades has received widespread media coverage in France, where it continues to capture the public interest. The murder remains unsolved.\n\nIn the years preceding the murder, Gregory's parents, the Villemins, had been receiving anonymous letters and phone calls from a male threatening revenge against Grégory's father, Jean-Marie Villemin. This person, who had detailed knowledge of the extended Villemin family, was later referred to as \"Le Corbeau\" (\"the Crow\", French slang for \"the informant\").\n\nAt 5 P.M 32. on 16 October 1984, an anonymous call was made to Gregory's uncle, stating that the boy had been taken and had been thrown into the Vologne River. Grégory, who had been playing in front of his house, was later confirmed as a missing person, thus beginning a manhunt. Grégory's body was later found in the Vologne with his hands and feet bound with rope and a woolen hat pulled down over his face.\n\nOn 17 October the Villemins received an anonymous letter that said \"I have taken vengeance\". Bernard Laroche, a cousin of Jean-Marie Villemin, was implicated in the murder by handwriting experts and by Laroche's sister-in-law and taken into custody on 5 November 1984. The sister-in-law later recanted her testimony and Laroche, who denied any part in the crime or being \"the Crow\", was released from custody on 4 February 1985. Jean-Marie Villemin vowed in front of the press that he would kill Laroche. On 25 March handwriting experts identified Grégory's mother Christine as the likely author of the anonymous letters. On 29 March 1985, Jean-Marie Villemin shot Laroche dead as he was leaving for work. Jean-Marie Villemin was convicted of murder and served 5 years in prison.\n\nIn December 1986, Christine Villemin was charged with the murder, but was ultimately cleared of the charges on 2 February 1993.\n\nThe case was reopened in 2000 to allow for DNA testing on a stamp used to send one of the anonymous letters, but the tests were inconclusive. In December 2008, following an application by the Villemins, a judge ordered the case reopened to allow DNA testing of the rope used to bind Grégory, the letters, and other evidence. This testing proved inconclusive. Further DNA testing in April 2013 on Grégory's clothes and shoes was also inconclusive.\n\nIn June 2017, based on new evidence, three people were arrested. Grégory's great-aunt and great-uncle, as well as an aunt—the widow of a biological uncle who died in 2010—were arrested on 14 June 2017. The aunt was released, while the great aunt and great uncle have invoked their right to remain silent. The police stated that they did not know who killed the child, but that there are multiple new suspects.\n\nOn 11 July 2017, the magistrate in charge of the first investigation, Jean-Michel Lambert, committed suicide, citing in a farewell letter to a local newspaper the increasing pressure resulting from the reopening of the case.\n"}

It is the top competition series of the NHRA, comprising competition in four classes, including Top Fuel Dragster, Funny Car, Pro Stock, and Pro Stock Motorcycle.\n\nThe champion of each category is determined by a point system where points are given according to finishing placement and qualifying effort. The season is divided into two segments. After the first 18 races, the Top 10 of each pro category are locked in and compete in the last six races with the difference in points greatly minimized.\n\nThe series has four main professional classes: Top Fuel Dragster, Funny Car, Pro Stock, and Pro Stock Motorcycle. Top Fuel was the first category, with Funny Cars added in 1966, Pro Stock four years later and Pro Stock Motorcycles in 1987. Both Top Fuel and Funny Cars regularly see top speeds in excess of today, and one thousand foot times anywhere from 3.70 to 4 seconds. Both these cars burn fuel consisting of 90% nitromethane and 10% methanol. The Pro Stock record is , with times often in the 6.4-6.7 second range and the Pro Stock Motorcycles usually run at 190+ mph (), with times in the low 7- to high 6-second range. Top Fuel (class designation: AA/D top fuel dragster) and Fuel Funny Car (class designation: AA/FC top fuel coupe) have recently been limited to a track, instead of the historic 1/4 mile [], as a means to limit top speeds and increase safety (there had been a number of engine explosions at or near 300 mph resulting in driver injuries and death). Currently, driver and spectator safety has been enhanced even while top speeds often approach and exceed 300 mph.\n\nSome of the popular racers to come through the series include \"Big Daddy\" Don Garlits, Don \"The Snake\" Prudhomme, and Shirley Muldowney. Those three gained much attention from the 1960s through 1970s with their speed and personalities, a combination rarely achieved today through the political correctness of sponsorship in today's drivers. Nonetheless there are still colorful characters today, such as 16-time Funny Car world champion John Force. His daughter, 2007 Rookie of the Year Ashley Force Hood has made appearances on \"Good Morning America\" and \"The Tonight Show\" and was voted AOL's Hottest Female Athlete in 2007.\n\nOn July 2, 2008, following the death of Funny Car driver Scott Kalitta, the NHRA announced that race distances for Top Fuel and Funny Car classes would temporarily be reduced to 1,000 ft from the traditional 1/4 mile (1320 ft). The measure was intended to be temporary while safety solutions were explored; however, the races have remained at 1000 feet since Kalitta's death. Although unpopular with the fans, the distance remains at 1,000 feet today at the request of the teams as a cost-saving measure, with no indication by NHRA officials of any intent of returning to the full quarter-mile format any time soon. By late 2012, 1,000 foot racing became globally recognised as the 2012 FIA European title in Top Fuel became 1,000-foot championships, as Santa Pod and Hockenheim (the last two quarter-mile nitro strips) made the switch, and Australian nitro racing switched to the 1,000-foot distance only for selected tracks.\n\nStarting with the 2007 season, the NHRA implemented a playoff system to determine the champion in each class, billed as the \"Countdown to The Championship\". Each season is divided into two segments of races, with the bulk of the races making up the first segment, and the final events making up the second segment. After the first segment is complete, the drivers in each class at or above the cutoff point in the standings (8th place up to 2007 and 10th place thereafter) become eligible for the championship, while the drivers below the cutoff point are eliminated from championship contention, though they still participate in the remaining race events. The points for the advancing drivers are readjusted so that they are separated by a fixed margin, with first place receiving bonus points. The drivers then compete for the championship over the final races of the season.\n\nWinston cigarettes was the title sponsor of the series from 1975 until 2001, when a condition of the Master Settlement Agreement required Winston to drop either its sponsorship of the NHRA, or the NASCAR Winston Cup Series; Winston chose to retain its NASCAR sponsorship. Winston ended their sponsorship with NASCAR two years later. The Coca-Cola Company has since held the title sponsorship rights for the series, under a deal that, in 2012, was extended through 2018. From 2001 to 2008, the series was branded with the company's Powerade brand, before switching to Full Throttle in 2009. In 2013, following Coca-Cola's most recent extension of its sponsorship, the title sponsor was changed to Mello Yello. \n\nWith Mello Yello having introduced a new logo, the NHRA unveiled a new logo for the series in January 2016, as well as a new \"My NHRA\" marketing campaign that plays upon the logo to feature drivers and other personalities discussing what the NHRA means to them.\n\nBefore 1974, the season champion was determined by the winner of the World Finals event. The Professional categories contain the divisions of Top Fuel, Funny Car, Pro Stock (Automobile), and Pro Stock Motorcycle.\n\nNHRA events have been broadcast on television, with such efforts dating back as far as 1985. By the 1990s, events were split between ESPN, NBC, and The Nashville Network. TNN also broadcast a weekly highlight program, \"NHRA Today\". Due to logistical and scheduling issues, including the possibility of long turnaround times between heats, weather delays, and other factors, events are typically broadcast in a condensed form via tape delay. From 1992 until 2000, TNN carried live coverage of selected final rounds, typically with a condensed package to air until the finals began.\n\nIn 2001, the NHRA entered into an agreement with ESPN for it to become the exclusive broadcaster of NHRA events, shortly after MTV Networks had effectively shut down the CBS motorsport operations after its acquisition of CBS Cable, and the demise of TNN. During its 14-year stint as rightsholder, ESPN faced criticism for the structure and scheduling of its coverage. Due to scheduling conflicts with other sports properties to which it held rights, ESPN typically broadcast its NHRA coverage in inconsistent and otherwise undesirable timeslots. In the final years of the contract, the NHRA attempted to structure selected events so that they could be televised live; by the 2015 season, at least six events were broadcast live.\n\nIn July 2015, ESPN and the NHRA agreed to end their contract one year early, with the association citing ESPN's scheduling issues as a concern. In turn, the NHRA announced a new television deal with Fox Sports beginning in the 2016 season. Coverage primarily airs on the FS1 and FS2 cable channels, while 4 events per-season are broadcast on Fox (including the flagship U.S. Nationals). Fox committed to televising live Sunday coverage from at least 16 of the 23 events per-season, two-hour qualification broadcasts and encores (including the condensed highlights program \"NHRA in 30\"), and coverage of selected Sportsman Series events. NHRA president Peter Clifford explained that the deal would be a \"game-changer\" for the association, citing Fox's history of motorsports programming, as well as its commitment to increased coverage of NHRA events, including live network television coverage.\n\nDuring the first two years of the contract, Fox had achieved an average viewership of 600,000 viewers—a major increase over ESPN's broadcasts. Some events had attracted an audience of over 1 million. The association cited favorable scheduling practices (including better time slots and additional encores, as well as using NASCAR broadcasts as a lead-in), and increased promotion of the event broadcasts as part of FS1 and FS2's programming, as having helped build their audience.\n\n"}

It features joy rides, eateries and other entertainment options for the visitors.\n\n\"Numaish Masnuaat-e-Mulki\" meaning \"Exhibition of the Local Products\", was started in 1938 by a group of graduates of Osmania University to showcase local products. It was the reign of the Last Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan.

Based on the Welsh Eisteddfod, Oireachtas na Gaeilge runs for one week, featuring performances, demonstrations and competitions. The festival is held in two portions: a visual arts festival in April/May and the festival proper on the last weekend of October or the first of November, when more than 10,000 people attend the seven-day event. In 2007, the festival was held at Westport. The 2008 festival took place in the Cork city suburb of Douglas, the local support committee was under the chairmanship of Peadar Ó Riada, son of the composer and founder of the male choir Cór Chúil Aodha, Seán Ó Riada.\n\nThe first Oireachtas na Gaeilge festival was organised in 1897 by Conradh na Gaeilge (the Gaelic League), which envisaged it as part of a renaissance of traditional Irish arts and culture. in the Round Room of Dublin's Rotunda, one of the largest halls in the city at that time. It was just a half-day festival, but the attendance still exceeded a thousand people, an unexpected level of interest.\n\nIn contrast to today's festival, there was little emphasis on the performing arts. The competitions included two for poetry, five for prose essays, one for poetry compilations; a competition for unpublished songs or stories in Irish; a competition for new song compositions and a recitation competition.\n\nWhile the festival management pulled off accomplishments including the staging of the first Irish-language opera, the popularity of the Oireachtas waned in the early part of the twentieth century, and the festival was cancelled for a number of years in the 1920s and 1930s. In response, the organisers, under the Directorship of Liam Ó Maolaodha attempted from the 1990s on to market the festival to younger speakers of Irish via outings, discos, and other youth-oriented events.\n\nThe festival was originally held in Dublin, but since the 1970s, it has been held in different cities and towns around Ireland. The festival culminates in four major competitions over the weekend: Comórtas na mBan, a Sean-nós singing competition for women, Comórtas na bhFear, for men, Corn Uí Riada, for all age and gender categories, and the Comórtas Damhsa ar an Sean Nós (\"Steip\"), a free-style dancing competition mainly based on the Conamara individual step style now popular around the country, but also includes dancing in other regional styles. Past winners of Corn Uí Riada include Áine Uí Cheallaigh, Lillis Ó Laoire, Máirtín Tom Sheánín Mac Donnchadha, Mícheál Ó Confhaola and 2008 winner Ciarán Ó Con Cheanainn from An Spidéal. Contae na Gaillimhe.\n\nRTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta has been covering the bigger Oireachtas events live since 1973 and these broadcasts are in considerable demand from internet audiences around the globe, particularly Corn Uí Riada and the sean-nós stage competitions. Steip, the Sean nós dancing competition, on TG4 has consistently attracted the station's highest annual audience figures. Its success is due to the hard work of Festival administrator Máirín Nic Dhonnchadha who effectively revived the competition from 2000 onwards. In 2008, for the first time, the station broadcast live segments of the Corn Uí Riada competition.\n\n\n"}

Known for the hundreds of caricatures of show-business celebrities that adorn its walls, Sardi's opened at its current location on March 5, 1927.\n\nMelchiorre Pio Vincenzo \"Vincent\" Sardi Sr. (born in S. Marzano Oliveto, Italy on December 23, 1885 – died November 19, 1969) and his wife Eugenia (\"Jenny\") Pallera (born in Castell'Alfero, Italy on July 14, 1889) opened their first eatery, The Little Restaurant, in the basement of 246 West 44th Street in 1921. When that building was slated for demolition in 1926 (to build the St. James Theatre), they accepted an offer from the theater magnates, the Shubert brothers, to relocate to a new building the brothers were erecting down the block. The new restaurant, Sardi's, opened March 5, 1927.\n\nWhen business slowed after the move, Vincent Sardi sought a gimmick to attract customers. Recalling the movie star caricatures that decorated the walls of Joe Zelli’s, a Parisian restaurant and jazz club, Sardi decided to recreate that effect in his establishment. He hired a Russian refugee named Alex Gard (1898–1948) (born Alexis Kremkoff in Kazan, Russia) to draw Broadway celebrities. Sardi and Gard drew up a contract that stated Gard would make the caricatures in exchange for one meal per day at the restaurant. The first official caricature by Gard was of Ted Healy, the vaudevillian of Three Stooges fame. When Sardi’s son, Vincent Sardi Jr. (1915–2007), took over restaurant operations in 1947, he offered to change the terms of Gard's agreement. Gard refused and continued to draw the caricatures in exchange for meals until his death.\n\nFrequent mentions of the restaurant in newspaper columns by Walter Winchell and Ward Morehouse added to Sardi’s growing popularity. Winchell and Morehouse belonged to a group of newspapermen, press agents, and drama critics who met for lunch regularly at Sardi’s and referred to themselves as the Cheese Club. Heywood Broun, Mark Hellinger, press agent Irving Hoffman, actor George Jessel, and Ring Lardner were also Cheese Club members. In fact, it was Hoffman who first brought Alex Gard to Sardi's for lunch at the Cheese Club table. Gard drew caricatures of the Cheese Club members, and Vincent Sardi hung them above their table. It was then that Sardi recalled the drawings at Zelli's and made his deal with Gard.\n\nThe restaurant became known as a pre- and post-theater hangout, as well as a location for opening night parties. Vincent Sardi, a theater lover, kept the restaurant open much later than others in the area to accommodate Broadway performers' schedules.\n\nAlex Gard, who created more than 700 caricatures for the restaurant, died in 1948. After Gard, John Mackey took over drawing for the restaurant but was soon replaced by Don Bevan. Bevan did the drawings until 1974 when he retired, and was replaced by Brooklyn-born Richard Baratz, a banknote and certificate engraver by profession. Baratz, who lives in Pennsylvania, continues to the present day as the Sardi's caricaturist. As of 2005, there are more than 1,300 celebrity caricatures on display.\n\nAccording to actor Robert Cuccioli's spokesperson Judy Katz, in an interview with \"Playbill\": \"On the day Jimmy Cagney died, his caricature was stolen from the Sardi's wall. Since then, when drawings are done, the originals go into a vault, and two copies are made. One goes to the lucky subject of the caricature, the other up on the Sardi's wall. This way, potential thieves won't have their moment.\"\n\nIn 1979, Vincent Sardi Jr. donated a collection of 227 caricatures from the restaurant to the Billy Rose Theatre Collection of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.\n\nWhile the Sardi family was Italian, their restaurant's cuisine is not; rather it tends toward \"English food\", a Continental menu. In 1957, Vincent Sardi Jr. collaborated with Helen Bryson to compile a cookbook of Sardi's recipes. \"Curtain Up at Sardi's\" contains nearly 300 recipes ranging from a grilled cheese sandwich to a Champagne cocktail. By 1987, however, Zagat was describing the food as \"a culinary laughing stock.\" One customer who was surveyed called Sardi's \"the longest running gag on Broadway.\"\n\nIn 1932, a Los Angeles location of Sardi's opened on Hollywood Boulevard, where it was similarly popular with celebrities. It has since closed.\n\nSardi's is the birthplace of the Tony Award; after Antoinette Perry's death in 1946, her partner, theatrical producer and director Brock Pemberton, was eating lunch at Sardi's when he came up with the idea of a theater award to be given in Perry's honor. For many years Sardi’s was the location where Tony Award nominations were announced. Vincent Sardi Sr. received a special Tony Award in 1947, the first year of the awards, for \"providing a transient home and comfort station for theatre folk at Sardi's for 20 years.\" In 2004, Vincent Sardi Jr. received a Tony Honor for Excellence in the Theatre. Sardi's is also the venue for the presentation of the Outer Critics Circle Awards, as well as many other Broadway events, press conferences, and celebrations.\n\nThe restaurant is today considered a Broadway institution, to the point that composer Stephen Sondheim pointed to it when lamenting the changing climate of New York theater in a 2000 interview. Asked about the Broadway community, Sondheim replied, \"There's none whatsoever. The writers write one show every two or three years. Who congregates at Sardi's? What is there to congregate about? Shows just sit in theaters and last.\"\n\nMovies that have filmed scenes in Sardi's include:\n\n\nBooks that have referenced Sardi's include:\n\nSongs that have referenced Sardi's include:\n\nOn March 8, 1947, Vincent Sardi Jr. began a radio show broadcast live from the Sardi's dining room, called \"Luncheon at Sardi's\". It was hosted originally by Bill Slater. Subsequent hosts were Tom Slater, Ray Heatherton and Arlene Francis. Currently, on WOR Radio, Joan Hamburg occasionally does broadcasts from Sardi's.\n\n\n\n"}

The works were created under a road closure, using scaffolding and aerial work platforms.\n\nSee No Evil 2011, was a week-long graffiti art event, that claimed to be the largest street art event of its kind in the UK, reaffirmed Bristol's high position in the UK's urban art movement, and supports the claim, that Bristol may be the current international center of this urban art movement. The city has a well established and thriving urban art scene, with many walls around the city decorated over the years by artistic graffiti, notably around the Stokes Croft area, often by local but international respected urban artists like Inkie and Banksy. \"Urban and street art are widely felt to be an important part of the city's creative DNA\" (Bennet). The event was organised by respected Bristol street artist Inkie (Tom Bingle) who emerged (like Banksy) out of Bristol's 1980s graffiti scene. Inkie said that the inspiration for the event arose partly from witnessing similarly grand street art projects in Lisbon and Melbourne: \"I thought it was about time Bristol, home of urban art in the UK had an installation of this scale.\" \"Nothing of this size and scale has ever taken place in the UK and it's an event that has captured the minds of some the world's most respected street artists. It's a major coupé that we've managed to pull this off in Bristol.\"\n\nThe event was coordinated by Inkie, along with Mike Bennett - Bristol City Council, Bristol based music promoter Team Love (made up of music producers Dave Harvey and Tom Payne) and Sam Brandt, director of \"Weapon of Choice Gallery\". The Council contributed to the project, on the assumption of attracting tourists, with place-making director Mike Bennett paying for half of the project through his salary. The was to be matched by private donations. The organizers spent a year planning the project, with full support from the street's residents, businesses and building owners. Team Love (TL) organised the music festival and street party.\n\nBefore 20 August 2011, the chosen location, Nelson Street, was \"one of the most depressing, ugly and run down streets in Bristol\" (Mike Bennet). A dreary '1960's urban nightmare. Decaying and decrepit' (Inkie). \"Bristol's Nelson Street was nothing but empty shells of grey buildings built by tasteless architects that stank of piss,\" a nondescript corridor of bleak, grey buildings between Broadmead and Colston Square in the city centre \"It needs something big development-wise... with the economy as it is, the prospect of any serious development here in the next five years is almost nonexistent.\" A spokesperson of one of the buildings said \"anything that would revitalise the street and increase footfall for a minimal cost – then all the better.\"\n\nThe council viewed the project as a platform to revitalize the street and encourage its regeneration. The councils Executive member for culture Simon Cook said: \"This project is very exciting for Bristol. ...this will put us on the map internationally\" as a cultural and tourist attraction. Two years previously Banksy show at the City Museum and Art Gallery had attracted large crowds. The organisers also looked towards Melbourne, Australia, were a street project attracted almost half a million visitors a year as an example of how street art could help regenerate urban area.\n\nThe name 'See No Evil', Bennett explained, is from the three wise monkeys who see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. \"It sort of works on the artistic element, and because it has a musical element to it as well. And of course because we're taking over the old magistrates' courts\" and Police station. The irony of Inkie being invited to paint the very courts he was sentenced in after Operation Anderson years before, as the ringleader of 75 plus artists in the UK's largest graffiti-related arrest, was not lost. \"Half the early graffiti artists in Bristol must have been taken to that police station or through the magistrates' courts at one time or another\" . \"I mean, we've legally painted the old juvenile and magistrates' courts where a few of these artists have been processed and charged. It was quite a surreal thing to see.\" \n\nA total of 72 graffiti artists were invited to take part, including twenty of the world's leading artists. Writing in \"The Independent\", Louisa McGillicuddy noted that only two of the artists were women.\n\nSources for the table below unless otherwise stated.\n\nOther Artists included: Kid Acne, Swanski, Ben Slow, Best Ever, Bonzai, Cosmo Sarsen, Dicey, Feek, GMC, Hit + Run, Maumau, Mr Wany, Mysterious Al, Pinky, Ponk, SEPR, Wow 123, Xenz, Zeus, Solo One, and Goldie\n\nA 16 minute long short film about See No Evil 2011, \"Who's Lenny?,\" was commissioned by the Council. It was produced by Bristol-based production company Hurricane Media. The film was made using a range of techniques including wirecam technology – a first in a UK urban environment - as well as time-lapse photography and 24-hour live coverage.\n\n\"See No Evil: Who's Lenny\" explains how once outlawed graffiti artists have now come to critical acclaim, and how one group in particular were invited to paint the courts of law in which they were once convicted for their art. The video aims to present street art as a vibrant and contemporary art form. The documentary includes interviews with some of the 72 artists involved including Inkie, Tats Cru, El Mac, Nick Walker, Shoe, Xenz, China Mike and Paris. Focusing on the See No Evil event, the film also explores how street art has a natural home in Bristol, capturing the spirit of Bristol graffiti scene.\n\nThe film went on to win Royal Television Society (RTS) Awards for Best Short Film and Best Community Media in February 2012.\n\nArrangements were made by Inkie for the repainting of the street in August 2012, as part of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad accompanying the Summer Olympics and Paralympics, with support from Bristol City Council, the Arts Council and London 2012 Festival as part of the 2012 Cultural Olympiad and Bristol University. See No Evil 2012 began on 13 August when 45 selected (both local and international) artists, with 3,500 cans of spray paint and 700 litres of paint.\n\nThe event took place on Nelson Street again, a one-way bus and taxi lane known for its depressingly grey concrete walls (including a 12-story office block and a police station) over the course of 7 days– with the permission of the owners. Three works from the 2011 event's 72 pieces were saved by the public vote, via an internet poll allowing people to voice their opinions on preferred works, those being the suited man pouring a tin of red paint, the wolf boy, and the woman and child; painted by Nick Walker, Aryz and El Mac respectively.\n\nIt is intended that See No Evil at Nelson Street will remain Europe's largest open air street art gallery, with huge murals until the following summer. Some of the artists (including ManOne and Vyal One, FLX One and Dones and Limited Press) in the same week also created work on hoardings around the Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone.\n\nSources unless otherwise stated.\nBoth years, alongside the live art event of See No Evil with graffiti artists at work, Hear No Evil hosted live music and DJ sets with artists from Bristol's music scene, plus graffiti workshops, food stalls, breakdancing, face painting, and pop-up galleries. For both years there were music events in the disused Westgate Building. Both years had a Hear no Evil block party on the final Saturday and in 2012 Busking day on Sunday 19 August. For 2012 the opening event was an audio-visual immersive event, \"Mail, Maps & Motion\", on Friday 17 August, featured a collaboration of Joanie Lemercier (from 3D projection people AntiVJ) and musicians Adrian Utley of Portishead and Will Gregory of Goldfrapp, took place at the Passenger Shed.\n\nSome Conservative councillors said that the exhibition was a waste of money and were unhappy the Liberal Democrat-run council had contributed towards funding it.\n\nBristol City Council Leader Barbara Janke said: \"When the economy is suffering generally, it is important for councils to take steps like these to stimulate the city's economy. ..This daring and entrepreneurial project has acted as a catalyst for change in this once unloved part of the city centre. ...\"Bristol is leading the way by promoting one aspect of the city's own unique character to a much wider audience to generate wider economic benefits.\"\n\nJonathan Jones writing in \"The Guardian\" about the 2011 event concluded that street art was dying. \"Maybe there was a time when painting a wittily satirical or cheekily rude picture or comment on a wall was genuinely disruptive and shocking. That time is gone\" and went on to say, \"Images far too ordinary to be exhibited in art galleries are admired because they are on the street\".\n\n2012, Nelson Street business woman, Lynne Tonks, said it was \"the best thing that they ever did in this street...They've increased the foot flow,\" with more tourists were attracted to the area, less crime and vandalism. \"It's a pleasanter environment to work in and for people to come to,\" Ms Tonks said. \"Graffiti is something that Bristol should be proud of, Banksy's put it on the map and other people are following - and it looks great.\"\n\nSee No Evil 2011 not only successfully rejuvenated a very run down area of Bristol but generated enough publicity to turn it into one of Bristol's biggest tourist attractions. When asked about the legacy of See No Evil, Dave Harvey from Team Love said \"In terms of legacy – obviously the street itself. This street this time last year, no one came here, there was nothing on the street, it was really grey and dismal. This year council figures show tens of thousands more people are coming down here every month to look at the art.\"\n\nInkie said \"The future of See No Evil is a more diverse base of art forms including photography, digital and animation with bigger music acts and better installations and street dressings. This is something we would like to take on tour to other cities across the globe. The legacy is the longstanding effect on the youth and their creativity in Bristol through the outreach projects and workshops in which we are directly inspiring the youth and showing them ways to express themselves. This will lead in turn to a bigger creative scene in Bristol for the future.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "589824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=589824", "title": "The Old Vic", "text": "The Old Vic\n\nThe Old Vic is a 1,000-seat, not-for-profit producing theatre, located just south-east of Waterloo station on the corner of the Cut and Waterloo Road in Lambeth, London, England. Established in 1818 as the Royal Coburg Theatre, and renamed in 1833 the Royal Victoria Theatre, in 1871 it was rebuilt and reopened as the Royal Victoria Palace. It was taken over by Emma Cons in 1880 and formally named the Royal Victoria Hall, although by that time it was already known as the \"Old Vic\". In 1898, a niece of Cons, Lilian Baylis assumed management and began a series of Shakespeare productions in 1914. The building was damaged in 1940 during air raids and it became a Grade II* listed building in 1951 after it reopened.\n\nThe Old Vic is the crucible of many of the performing arts companies and theatres in London today. It was the name of a repertory company that was based at the theatre and formed (along with the Chichester Festival Theatre) the core of the National Theatre of Great Britain on its formation in 1963, under Laurence Olivier. The National Theatre remained at the Old Vic until new premises were constructed on the South Bank, opening in 1976. The Old Vic then became the home of Prospect Theatre Company, at that time a highly successful touring company which staged such acclaimed productions as Derek Jacobi's \"Hamlet\". However, with the withdrawal of funding for the company by the Arts Council of Great Britain in 1980 for breaching its touring obligations, Prospect disbanded in 1981. The theatre underwent complete refurbishment in 1985. In 2003, Kevin Spacey was appointed artistic director, which received considerable media attention. In 2015, Matthew Warchus succeeded Spacey as artistic director.\n\nThe theatre was founded in 1818 by James King and Daniel Dunn (formerly managers of the Surrey Theatre in Bermondsey), and John Thomas Serres, then the marine painter to the King. Serres managed to secure the formal patronage of Princess Charlotte and her husband Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, and named the theatre the Royal Coburg Theatre. The theatre was a \"minor\" theatre (as opposed to one of the two patent theatres) and was thus technically forbidden to show serious drama. Nevertheless, when the theatre passed to George Bolwell Davidge in 1824 he succeeded in bringing legendary actor Edmund Kean south of the river to play six Shakespeare plays in six nights. The theatre's role in bringing high art to the masses was confirmed when Kean addressed the audience during his curtain call saying \"I have never acted to such a set of ignorant, unmitigated brutes as I see before me.\" More popular staples in the repertoire were \"sensational and violent\" melodramas demonstrating the evils of drink, \"churned out by the house dramatist\", confirmed teetotaller Douglas Jerrold.\n\nWhen Davidge left to take over the Surrey Theatre in 1833, the theatre was bought by Daniel Egerton and William Abbot, who tried to capitalise on the abolition of the legal distinction between patent and minor theatres, enacted in Parliament earlier that year. On 1 July 1833, the theatre was renamed the Royal Victoria Theatre, under the \"protection and patronage\" of Victoria, Duchess of Kent, mother to Princess Victoria, the 14-year-old heir presumptive to the British throne. The duchess and the princess visited only once, on 28 November of that year, but enjoyed the performance, of light opera and dance, in the \"pretty...clean and comfortable\" theatre. The single visit scarcely justified the \"Old Vic\" its later billing asf \"Queen Victoria's Own Theayter\". By 1835, the theatre was advertising itself simply as the Victoria Theatre. \n\nIn 1841, David Osbaldiston took over as lessee, and was succeeded on his death in 1850 by his lover and the theatre's leading lady, Eliza Vincent, until her death in 1856. Under their management, the theatre remained devoted to melodrama. In 1858, sixteen people were crushed to death inside the theatre after mass panic caused while an actor's clothing caught fire.\n\nIn 1880, under the ownership of Emma Cons (for whose memory there are plaques outside and inside the theatre) it became the Royal Victoria Hall and Coffee Tavern and was run on \"strict temperance lines\"; by this time it was already known as the \"Old Vic\". The \"penny lectures\" given in the hall led to the foundation of Morley College. An endowment from the estate of Samuel Morley led to the creation of the \"Morley Memorial College for Working Men and Women\" on the premises, which were shared; lectures were given back stage, and in the theatre dressing rooms. The adult education college moved to its own premises nearby in the 1920s.\n\nWith Emma Cons's death in 1912 the theatre passed to her niece Lilian Baylis, who emphasised the Shakespearean repertoire. The Old Vic Company was established in 1929, led by Sir John Gielgud. Between 1925 and 1931, Lilian Baylis championed the re-building of the then-derelict Sadler's Wells Theatre, and established a ballet company under the direction of Dame Ninette de Valois. For a few years the drama and ballet companies rotated between the two theatres, with the ballet becoming permanently based at Sadler's Wells in 1935.\n\nThe Old Vic was damaged badly during the Blitz, and the war-depleted company spent all its time touring, based in Burnley, Lancashire at the Victoria Theatre during the years 1940 to 1943. In 1944, the company was re-established in London with Ralph Richardson and Laurence Olivier as its stars, performing mainly at the New Theatre (now the Noël Coward Theatre) until the Old Vic was ready to reopen in 1950. In 1946, an offshoot of the company was established in Bristol as the Bristol Old Vic.\n\nIn 1963, the Old Vic company was dissolved and the new National Theatre Company, under the artistic direction of Lord Olivier, was based at the Old Vic until its own building was opened on the South Bank near Waterloo Bridge in 1976.\nIn July 1974 the Old Vic presented a rock concert for the first time. National Theatre director Sir Peter Hall arranged for the progressive folk-rock band Gryphon to première \"Midnight Mushrumps\", the fantasia inspired by Hall's own 1974 Old Vic production of \"The Tempest\" starring John Gielgud for which Gryphon had supplied the music.\n\nFor two years prior to the departure of the National Theatre company, Toby Robertson, director of the Prospect Theatre Company, sustained a campaign that the Old Vic should make Prospect its resident company. For the Old Vic, Robertson's overtures proved increasingly hard to resist in the face of poor box office returns achieved by productions staged by other visiting companies; against this, Prospect staged a highly successful season which opened in May 1977, including \"Hamlet\" with Derek Jacobi, \"Antony and Cleopatra\" with Alec McCowen and Dorothy Tutin; and \"Saint Joan\" with Eileen Atkins. In July the Governors of the Old Vic announced \"a marriage that was all but a merger\" between the Vic and Prospect. In September Toby Robertson, director of Prospect, was asked to take artistic control of the Old Vic, and Christopher Richards, general manager of the Old Vic, became general manager of Prospect.\n\nOne major problem, though, was the terms of Prospect's funding by the Arts Council of Great Britain: this was on the basis of it being a touring company, and the Council – already funding the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company in London – could not accept a case for a third major company in the capital and repeatedly refused requests to fund any London seasons staged by Prospect. Therefore, any London-based productions would have to succeed financially without Arts Council support. Prospect's first season at the Old Vic recouped its costs but left no surplus to fund future productions. Further stagings by visiting companies were box office failures and stretched the theatre's finances to breaking point. Yet Prospect continued to draw audiences to the Old Vic where other companies failed. In December 1978, the governors of the Old Vic agreed to a five-year contract with Prospect, announcing to the press on 23 April that henceforth they would be styled \"Prospect Productions Ltd., trading as the Old Vic Company\". Unfortunately Prospect's touring commitments kept the company out of the theatre for the first half of 1979, leaving the theatre to sink further into debt. The company returned in July with Jacobi's \"Hamlet\" (toured afterwards to Denmark, Australia and China, the first English theatre company to tour that country), followed by \"Romeo and Juliet\", and \"The Government Inspector\" with Ian Richardson. The following season, however, proved controversial: the proposed programming, including the double bill of \"The Padlock\" and \"Miss in Her Teens\", to mark the bicentenary of David Garrick's death, and a revival of \"What the Butler Saw\", were deemed by the Arts Council unsuitable for touring repertory. An internal report by Prospect now questioned \"whether Prospect can any longer satisfy the triple task of filling the Vic, of satisfying the Arts Council Director of Touring's requirements for product of a certain familiar sort, and of realising the vision of Toby Robertson\".\n\nRobertson was in effect fired as artistic director in 1980 while he was abroad with the company in China, Timothy West replacing him. The following season, West's first as Robertson's successor, saw \"Macbeth\" with Peter O'Toole, \"The Merchant of Venice\" with West as Shylock, and a gala performance presented to the Queen Mother to celebrate her eightieth birthday. On 22 December 1980, four days after the gala performance, the Arts Council withdrew its funding from the company, sealing its inevitable demise. The company gave a final season at the Old Vic in 1981, staging \"The Merchant of Venice\", then gave a final tour of Europe, giving its last performance in Rome on 14 June before disbanding.\n\nThe 'Old Vic Youth Theatre’ was an acting company for young people between the ages of 12 and 20 mainly from the London Borough of Southwark. The group was founded by Tom Vaughan of the Old Vic Theatre, Raymond Rivers of Morley College and Barry Anderson of the Southbank Education Institute. The Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) was the enterprise’s main funding body.\n\nDuring the early spring term of 1977 auditions consisting of improvisational scenes run by the Youth Theatre’s first professional directors Lucy Parker and Frederick Proud took place and around 40 applicants were chosen to form the company.\n\nBy the middle of the summer in 1977 the 'Old Vic Youth Theatre’ had performed two plays for the paying public. First was ‘The Kitchen’ by Arnold Wesker which also incorporated improvised scenes alongside the actual script and was staged in the Emma Cons Hall at Morley College. The Youth Theatre’s second production, ‘A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ by William Shakespeare was first performed at the George Inn Courtyard as part of the Southwark Shakespeare Festival the same year and was the company’s debut production at the Old Vic Theatre itself.\n\nIn the autumn of 1977 a new round of auditions took place and the existing group expanded into two. One group concentrated on a famous scripted play whilst the other would devise a play through improvisation from which the material was scripted into a play by a professional playwright.\n\nThe Youth groups continued to produce plays with new members auditioning each September until the mid 1980s.\n\nThe Old Vic was significantly restored under the ownership of Toronto department-store entrepreneur 'Honest Ed' Mirvish in 1985. In 1987, his son David Mirvish installed Jonathan Miller as artistic director of the Old Vic and the theatre enjoyed several critical successes – including an Olivier Award for a production of the musical \"Candide\", but suffered three straight years of financial loss. In 1990, Mirvish terminated Miller's contract over budgetary issues, earning much negative criticism in the British press.\n\nIn 1997, Mirvish appointed Sir Peter Hall as artistic director and, again, enjoyed critical acclaim with such productions as \"The Master Builder\" with Alan Bates and \"Waiting for Godot\" with Ben Kingsley, but continuing financial loss. Within a year of the appointment, Mirvish terminated Hall's contract – again to much negative comment in the press – and put the Old Vic up for sale. In 1998, the building was bought by a new charitable trust, the \"Old Vic Theatre Trust 2000\". In 2000, the production company Criterion Productions was renamed \"Old Vic Productions plc\", though relatively few of its productions are at the Old Vic theatre.\n\nIn 2003, actor Kevin Spacey was appointed as new artistic director of the Old Vic Theatre Company. Spacey said he wanted to inject new life into the British theatre industry, and bring British and American theatrical talent to the stage. \n\nSince 2015 Matthew Warchus has been Artistic Director of The Old Vic. His debut season opened in September 2015 with Warchus's production of a new play about education, \"Future Conditional\" by Tamsin Oglesby. \n\nOn 24 October 2017 The Old Vic announced its bicentenary season. The theatre celebrated its 200th birthday on Friday 11 May 2018 with a free performance of Joe Penhall's Mood Music, featuring Ben Chaplin.\n\nProductions with Kevin Spacey as artistic director include:\n\n2011 season\n\n2012 season\n\n2013 season\n2014 season\n2015 season\nProductions with Matthew Warchus as artistic director include:\n\n2015-16 season\n\n2016-17 season\n\n2017-18 season\n\n2018-19 season\n\n\n\n"}

Participation is by invitation-only. All discussions take place under the Chatham House Rule.\n\nThe Oslo Forum also features biennial regional retreats in Africa and Asia.\n\nThe Mediators' Retreat, which in 2006 became known as the Oslo Forum, was initiated in 2003 as a small gathering of mediation practitioners. The first Forum only included 17 participants but the event has now expanded to around 100 participants each year. The Forum is scheduled over two days.\n\nIn November 2005, a regional retreat was organised for the first time in Singapore to discuss peace processes in South and South East Asia. Since then, Asian and African regional retreats have regularly taken place to complement the global retreat organised in Oslo.\n\nThe Forum aims to improve mediation practice, build a community of conflict mediation practitioners and increase peer learning. The Oslo Forum functions as a laboratory for testing peacemakers’ assumptions and ideas from diverse conflicts and regions, and as a safe venue for sharing lessons learnt and best practices, and challenging commonly held preconceptions.\n\nOslo Forum retreats attracts approximately one hundred senior mediators, key actors from the United Nations, intergovernmental and regional organisations, as well as government officials, private organisations, conflict party representatives, war correspondents, outstanding analysts, thinkers and experts.\n\nParticipants have included Kofi Annan, President Jimmy Carter, Aung San Suu Kyi, President Martti Ahtisaari, Baroness Catherine Ashton, President Mohammad Khatami, President Olusegun Obasanjo, President Juan Manuel Santos, Dr Javier Solana, Gerry Adams, and many others.\n\nThe participation of conflict protagonists has attracted international media attention. In 2015 Reuters reported that Afghan senior officials as well as Taliban representatives attended the Oslo Forum. Syrian government and opposition representatives have attended in recent years. Media also reported the attendance of representatives from the Philippines Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) in the context of a resumption of talks in summer 2013.\n\nAll discussions at the Oslo Forum are held under the Chatham House Rule of non-attribution. International media outlets have, however, covered main themes discussed at the Oslo Forum. This includes for example BBC coverage of discussions on possible peace talks with the Taliban in 2010 and 2015. Interviews with selected Oslo Forum participants on the side lines of the event and a recap of main themes have also featured in the New York Times, the Economist and numerous other outlets.

The tree, also called the Jackson Oak, is located at the corner of South Finley and Dearing Streets in Athens, Georgia, United States. The original tree, thought to have started life between the mid-16th and late 18th century, fell in 1942, but a new tree was grown from one of its acorns, and planted in the same location. The current tree is sometimes referred to as the Son of The Tree That Owns Itself. Both trees have appeared in numerous national publications, and the site is a local landmark.\n\nThe earliest-known telling of the tree's story comes from a front-page article entitled \"Deeded to Itself\" in the \"Athens Weekly Banner\" of August 12, 1890. The article explains that the tree had been located on the property of Colonel William Henry Jackson. William Jackson was the son of James Jackson (a soldier in the American Revolution as well as a congressman, U.S. senator, and governor of Georgia), and the father of another James Jackson (a congressman and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia). He was the brother of Jabez Young Jackson, also a congressman. (William Jackson was reportedly a professor at the University of Georgia, and is sometimes given the title of \"Doctor\". The nature of his military service and the source of the title \"Colonel\" are unknown.) Jackson supposedly cherished childhood memories of the tree, and, desiring to protect it, deeded to it the ownership of itself and its surrounding land. By various accounts, this transaction took place between 1820 and 1832. According to the newspaper article, the deed read:\n\nIt is unclear whether the story of the Tree That Owns Itself began with the \"Weekly Banner\" article, or if it had been an element of local folklore prior to that time. The article's author writes that, in 1890, there were few people still living who knew the story.\nThe story of the Tree That Owns Itself is very widely known, and is almost always presented as fact. However, only one person—the anonymous author of \"Deeded to Itself\"—has ever claimed to have seen Jackson's deed to the tree. Most writers acknowledge that the deed is lost or no longer exists, if in fact it ever did. Such a deed, even if it did exist, would have no legal standing. Under common law, the person receiving the property in question must have the legal capacity to receive it, and the property must be delivered to—and accepted by—the recipient.\n\nWilliam H. Jackson did, in fact, own the property on the opposite side of Dearing Street from the tree. That plot included the present-day 226 Dearing Street, but in the early 19th century it was simply designated Lot #14. The tree, however, is located on a portion of what had been Lot #15. Jackson and his wife Mildred, along with a J. A. Cobb, sold their property to a Dr. Malthus Ward in 1832, the same year cited on a plaque as being the date of the tree's deed. The Clarke County real estate indices contain no indication of when or from whom Jackson originally purchased the property, although much of the land in that area is reported to have belonged to a Major James Meriwether. Even though Jackson may have lived near the tree as an adult, his childhood was actually spent in Jefferson County, not in Athens, making it less likely that he had experienced idyllic childhood summers playing beneath the tree's branches.\n\nRecent deeds suggest that the tree's square footage remains part of the property at 125 Dearing Street. These documents describe a parcel bounded on the east by Finley Street and on the north by Dearing Street, an area that would seem to encompass the tree. However, the actual plat map for that property clearly does not include the tree's oddly shaped corner: its eastern line lies roughly to the west of the tree's location—as far as the tax assessor is concerned, the tree's area is not a part of that property.\n\nThis does not confirm that the tree owns itself, but suggests, rather, that it is considered to be within the right-of-way along Finley Street. Athens-Clarke County confirms that the tree is in the right-of-way, and is thus \"accepted for care\" by municipal authorities; according to city-county officials, local government and the owners of the adjacent property jointly serve as \"stewards\" for the care of the tree, while Athens' Junior Ladies' Garden Club serves as its \"primary advocate.\" Regarding Jackson's deed, one writer noted at the beginning of the 20th century, \"However defective this title may be in law, the public recognized it.\" In that spirit, it is the stated position of the Athens-Clarke County unified government that the tree, in spite of the law, does indeed own itself. It is the policy of the city of Athens to maintain it as a public street tree.\n\nThe original Tree That Owns Itself is estimated to have started life at some time between the mid-16th and late 18th centuries. The tree was considered by some to be both the biggest tree in Athens and the most famous tree in the United States. The tree predated the transformation of the area into a residential neighborhood beginning in the mid-19th century. The residence adjacent to the tree, known as Dominie House, was built at the corner of Milledge Avenue and Waddell Street in 1883, and was moved to its present location about twenty years later.\nBy 1906, erosion had become apparent at the base of the tree. George Foster Peabody paid to have new soil, a commemorative tablet, and a chain barricade supported by eight granite posts installed around the tree. Despite these efforts, the tree reportedly suffered heavy damage during an ice storm in 1907. Although attempts were made at preservation, rot had already set in, and the tree was permanently weakened.\n\nThe original oak fell on the evening of October 9, 1942, following a long period of decline. Its poor condition had been known for years, and within days of its collapse, a move was under way to replace the fallen tree with a \"son\" grown from one of its acorns. One account suggests that the tree had actually died several years before its collapse, the victim of root rot. The tree was over tall, and was estimated to be between 150 and 400 years old when it fell. It has been reported elsewhere that the tree fell on \"December 1\", 1942, succumbing not to old age and disease but rather to a violent windstorm that ravaged much of north Georgia that evening, causing widespread damage and killing several people. While it is possible that some portion of the tree had remained standing for several weeks, meeting a dramatic end at the hands of a killer storm, only the earlier date is supported by newspaper accounts. It is not known why the tree was not dated by counting its rings.\n\nAfter the original tree's demise, its small plot sat vacant for four years. Dan Magill, the young son of Athens' Junior Ladies Garden Club member Elizabeth Magill, suggested that his mother's club find a replacement for the tree. Several Athenians had cultivated seedlings from acorns of the original tree. One growing in the yard of Capt. Jack Watson, at in height, was deemed the best candidate for transplantation. The operation was directed by Roy Bowden of the College of Agriculture at the University of Georgia, assisted by students in the Department of Horticulture.\n\nThe new tree was officially dedicated in a formal ceremony on December 4, 1946. Athens Mayor Robert L. McWhorter presided and Dr. E.L. Hill, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, offered a short prayer. Also in attendance were Capt. and Mrs. Watson and representatives of the Garden Club. Club President Patsy Dudley announced that her group would henceforth take responsibility for maintenance of the tree's plot, which had fallen into disrepair during the vacancy. The new tree, trimmed back to a mere for transplantation, thrived in its new location. This tree is considered, popularly if not legally, to be the full heir of the original tree. As such, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Son of The Tree That Owns Itself\", although it is generally known by the same title as its progenitor. The tree was over tall .\n\nOn December 4, 1996, the Garden Club staged a celebration to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the planting of the new tree. Dan Magill, who, as a boy, had inspired the replanting effort, served as master of ceremonies.\n\nThe tree sits near the crest of a hill, at the southwest corner of the intersection of Dearing and Finley Streets, in a quiet residential neighborhood near downtown Athens and UGA's North Campus. The portion of Finley Street leading up the hill to the tree is Athens' only remaining cobblestone street. The tree's lot is separated from the larger portion of the adjacent property by a private driveway; its enclosure also juts several feet into Finley Street. Thus the tree may in fact appear to occupy a small but separate tract of land. The appearance of separation is accentuated by the retaining wall and ornamental chain barrier that surround the tree. Although located alongside private homes in a residential neighborhood, the Tree That Owns Itself is \"open\" to the public, and regularly attracts visitors.\n\nAlthough the story of the Tree That Owns Itself is more legend than history, the tree has become (along with the University Arch and the Double-Barreled Cannon) one of the most recognized and well-loved symbols of Athens. It is routinely featured in travel guides and other visitor information, and has even garnered international recognition through such publications as \"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\", where it has been featured on several occasions.\n\nThe site of the tree contains two stone tablets. The first is heavily weathered and has suffered the loss of one corner, while the second appears to be considerably newer. Both tablets paraphrase the same portion of William H. Jackson's supposed deed to the tree, with slight alterations made to transform the legalistic language into a first-person declaration of affection:\n\nA small brass plaque, about the size of a playing card, is attached to the lower left corner of the face of the more weathered of the two tablets. It reads:\n\nIn addition to the stone tablets a larger brass plaque is affixed to the concrete retaining wall that surrounds the tree. The plaque reads:\n\nThe entire Dearing Street Historic District (of which the tree is a \"resident\") was added to the National Register in 1975. The District incorporates an area very roughly bounded by Broad, Finley, Waddell, and Church Streets, and was recognized for its architectural significance. The tree was locally designated a historic landmark on February 2, 1988.\n\n\n"}

According to the U.S. government, the intention had been to bomb the nearby Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement. President Bill Clinton later apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental. Central Intelligence Agency director George Tenet testified before a congressional committee that the bombing was the only one in the campaign organized and directed by his agency, and that the CIA had identified the wrong coordinates for a Yugoslav military target on the same street. The Chinese government issued a statement on the day of the bombing stating that it was a \"barbarian act\".\n\nIn the days prior to the bombing, an attack folder labelled 'Belgrade Warehouse 1' was circulated for command approval. The folder originated within the CIA and described the target as a warehouse for a Yugoslav government agency suspected of arms proliferation activities. In this form, the strike was approved by President Clinton.\n\nIt is unclear if other NATO leaders approved the strike. A report by the French Ministry of Defense after the war stated that \"part of the military operations were conducted by the United States outside the strict framework of NATO\" and that a dual-track command structure existed. NATO had no authority over the B-2 stealth bombers that carried out the strike.\n\nAccording to the CIA account, the target was checked against 'no-strike' databases but these raised no alarms; these are lists of protected sites such as schools, hospitals and places of worship. The joint Observer/Politiken investigation later reported its journalists had interviewed various NATO and US officers who had checked the databases the morning after the attack and found the embassy listed at its correct location.\n\nOn the night of May 7–8, the strike was carried out by bombers of the United States Air Force's 509th Bomb Wing flying directly out of Whiteman AFB, Missouri. The bombers were armed with JDAM GPS-guided precision bombs but the geographic coordinates provided by the CIA and programmed into the bombs were those of the Chinese embassy away. At around midnight local time 5 bombs landed at the location indicated, striking the south end of the embassy almost simultaneously. The embassy had taken precautionary measures in view of the ongoing bombing campaign, sending staff home and housing others in the basement, but the attack still resulted in 3 fatalities, Shao Yunhuan (邵云环), Xu Xinghu (许杏虎) and his wife, Zhu Ying (朱颖), and 20 injuries.\n\nThe raid caused a dramatic rise in tension between China and the United States. An official statement on Chinese television denounced what it called a \"barbaric attack and a gross violation of Chinese sovereignty\". China's ambassador to the UN described what he called \"NATO's barbarian act\" as \"a gross violation of the United Nations charter, international law and the norms governing international relations\" and \"a violation of the Geneva convention\". President Clinton telephoned his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin. \n\nLarge demonstrations erupted at consular offices of the United States and other NATO countries in China in reaction to news of the bombing. On May 9, 1999, then vice-president Hu Jintao delivered a national televised speech condemning the \"barbaric\" and \"criminal conduct\" of NATO, which \"incited the fury of the Chinese people.\" He said the unauthorized demonstrations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenyang reflected the anger and patriotism of the Chinese people, and which the Chinese government fully supported, but urged against extreme and illegal conduct.\n\nThe protests continued for several days, during which tens of thousands of rock-throwing protesters kept US Ambassador James Sasser and other staff trapped in the Beijing embassy. The residence of the US Consul in Chengdu was damaged by fire and protestors tried to burn the consulate in Guangzhou. There were no reported injuries.\n\nPresident Clinton's apologies and those of the US State Department were not initially allowed to be broadcast by Chinese state-run media outlets. The demonstrations continued for four days before the Chinese government called a halt, eventually broadcasting President Clinton's apology on television and ordering the police to restrain the demonstrators. The two nations' leaders finally spoke on May 14.\n\nBy the end of 1999, relations began to gradually improve. In August, the U.S. government made a \"voluntary humanitarian payment\" of $4.5 million to the families of the three Chinese nationals who were killed and to the 27 injured in the bombing. On December 16, 1999, the two governments reached a settlement under which the United States agreed to pay $28 million in compensation for damage to the Chinese Embassy facility, and China agreed to pay $2.87 million in compensation for damage inflicted to the U.S. Embassy and other diplomatic facilities in China.\n\nLate on May 8, US Defense Secretary William Cohen and George Tenet issued a joint press release stating neither the aircrew involved nor the equipment were to blame for the incident. The first attempt to explain the bombing came on May 10. William Cohen told reporters \"In simple terms, one of our planes attacked the wrong target because the bombing instructions were based on an outdated map\". The statement made no mention of the CIA. It was subsequently revealed that the CIA possessed maps showing the embassy.\n\nWhile US officials then began, on the record, to deflect questions pending the outcome of further enquiries, they continued to brief journalists off the record. For example, also on May 10 Eric Schmitt published an account with most of the elements that were to feature in DCI Tenet's later admissions. The officials briefed Schmitt that \"the Chinese Embassy and a headquarters for a Yugoslav arms agency ... look very similar: same size, shape and height\", and that the buildings were apart, which was less than half of the measured distance.\n\nMedia criticism focused on the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), which issued a press release to counter the attacks stating that \"recent news reports regarding the accuracy of NIMA maps have been inaccurate or incomplete\" and that \"a hardcopy map is neither intended, nor used, as the sole source for target identification and approval.\"\n\nIn June, Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering led a delegation to China to present the US version of events.\n\nAccording to the official account, CIA analysts knew the address of the Yugoimport office to be Bulevar Umetnosti 2 (2 Boulevard of the Arts). Using this information, they attempted to pinpoint its geographic location by using the known locations and addresses of other buildings on parallel streets as reference points. Pickering referred to this technique as intersection and resection, not related to the method of resection and intersection.\n\nParallel lines were drawn from known addresses and locations on a parallel street. With this information it was attempted to reconstruct the pattern of street addresses on Bulevar Umetnosti, which was information unknown to the targeters. The pattern of street addresses on Bulevar Umetnosti was not as expected, and the targeter erroneously pinpointed the embassy \"located on a small side street at some distance on Bulevar Umetnosti\" from the intended target. This was not true as Ulica Tresnjevog Cveta (Cherry Blossom St, the small side street where the embassy was located) does not connect with Bulevar Umetnosti which ends short of the junction with Cherry Blossom St. A procedure designed to determine the coordinates of a known address on a known street produced the coordinates of a different address on a street neither a continuation of nor connected to the street targeted.\n\nMultiple checks designed to prevent attacks on sensitive targets each failed as the location of the embassy had not been updated since the embassy moved to New Belgrade three years earlier. As a result, the bombers took to the air with the coordinates of the Chinese embassy programmed into the bombs on board.\n\nThis account didn't draw a connection between the use of an old map and the targeting of the embassy and didn't address the reason that target authorization listed the objective as a warehouse instead of an office building.\n\nOn July 22, George Tenet made a statement before a public hearing of the House Intelligence Committee. Covering the same ground as Under Sec. Pickering's statement in China, he additionally acknowledged the target package originated within the CIA and that it was the sole CIA-directed strike of the war, stated that he had been personally unaware that the CIA was circulating strike requests and recognised that the CIA possessed maps correctly displaying the embassy. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre, giving evidence the same day, stated that \"NIMA is not at fault\".\n\nFew Chinese politicians believed the US version of events, believing instead the strike had been deliberate.\n\nFormer ambassador Li Daoyu stated \"we don't say it was a decision of Clinton or the White House\", but the Chinese government describes the US explanation for \"the so-called mistaken bombing\" as \"anything but convincing\" and has never accepted the US version of events.\n\nActing on a tip-off, Jens Holsoe of Danish newspaper \"Politiken\" contacted UK paper \"The Observer\" with a view to conducting a joint investigation. Holsoe, together with John Sweeney and Ed Vulliamy of \"The Observer\", interviewed numerous sources including a NATO officer \"serving in an operational capacity at the four-star level\", a staff-officer serving at a two-star level, a \"very high-ranking\" former US intelligence officer, a NATO flight controller at the Naples HQ for Kosovo air operations, and a US NIMA official. After a four-month investigation, they published their findings on Oct 17.\n\nAccording to the journalists' investigation the embassy bombing was a deliberate attack, which is consistent with the pattern of strikes that night where, according to NATO's official briefing of May 8, \"the focus was wholly on disrupting the national leadership [of Yugoslavia]\". Apart from \"the FDSP weapons warehouse\", every target that night was a command and control (C2) center.\n\nA further report in \"The Observer\" of November 28, 1999 added more details. According to the report, American officials indicated that the reason behind the bombing of the embassy, was because they believe the embassy had provided signals facilities for Željko Ražnatović, commonly known as Arkan, a Serb paramilitary leader wanted by the ICTY for war crimes. NATO's briefing of May 8, which stated Arkan's HQ was at the Hotel Yugoslavia away, is consistent with this interpretation.\n\nRepresentatives of NATO governments dismissed the investigation. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright described it as \"balderdash\" and UK Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said there wasn't a \"shred of evidence to support this rather wild story\".\n\nInitially, the \"New York Times\" refused to report on the investigation until its findings could be corroborated. Subsequently, Andrew Rosenthal informed letter-writers by post that the \"Times\" hadn't found evidence to support the allegations. The Times didn't contact the authors or their sources.\n\nOther sources, including major American media such as the \"Washington Post\", \"New York Times\", and \"Chicago Tribune\" maintained that while responsibility was found in the inaccurate planning of air strikes, the attack was not deliberate. International News wires like The Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France Press (AFP) published numerous reports supporting both the accidental and deliberate attack theories. The American media was criticized for devoting little attention to the incident, as well as for consistently referring to the incident as an \"accidental bombing\", where China contested that belief.\n\nThe Observer/Politiken article was ignored by the US media; however, a \"Salon\" article by Laura Rozen featured an interview of \"Washington Post\" columnist and former intelligence officer William M. Arkin, who was dismissive of the investigation. While acknowledging that investigators had spoken to signals intelligence officers in NATO, Arkin told Rozen: \"The Chinese Embassy and the Hotel Yugoslavia, where Arkan's generals were believed to be commanding his paramilitary Tigers, are right across the street from each other, and in fact both were bombed the same night [...] I think there were communications emanating from the Hotel Yugoslavia across the street. And I think that stupid people who are leaking rumors to the Observer have made that mistake.\"\n\nThe Hotel Yugoslavia was attacked on May 7, but NATO was aware of its function and connection with Arkan. Arkin did not discuss the way that NATO planners could be aware of the HQ and target it successfully if they were confused about its location.\n\nA report conducted by the ICTY entitled Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia after the Kosovo War examined the attack on the Chinese embassy specifically and came to the conclusion that the OTP (Office of the Prosecutor) should not undertake an investigation concerning the bombing of the Chinese Embassy. In reaching its decision, it rendered the following observations:\n\nAmnesty International examined the NATO air campaign and assessed the legality of its actions. In the case of the embassy bombing Amnesty reported both on the official explanation and to the Observer/Politiken investigation without arbitrating as to which was true. NATO was criticised for continuing its bombing campaign uninterrupted when its safeguards to protect civilians were known to be faulty. A genuinely accidental attack would not imply legal responsibility, but the report stated that \"the very basic information needed to prevent this mistake was publicly and widely available\" and that \"NATO failed to take the necessary precautions required by Article 57(2) of Protocol I\" of the Geneva conventions.\n\nMarking the 10th anniversary of the bombing, on May 7, 2009, mayor of Belgrade Dragan Đilas and Chinese Ambassador to Serbia Wei Jinghua dedicated the commemorative plaque on the location. The author of the plaque is Nikola Kolja Milunović.\n\nDuring the visit of the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping to Serbia in June 2016, he and his Serbian counterpart Tomislav Nikolić visited the location, declared the nearby turnaround a Square of the Serbian-Chinese Friendship and announced the construction of the Chinese Cultural Center on the location of the former embassy. The construction of the center began on July 20, 2017, in the presence of mayor Siniša Mali and Chinese ambassador Li Manchang. The edifice will have 10 floors, 2 below the ground and 8 above, with the total floor area of . The project will cost 45 million euros and should be finished in January 2019.\n\n"}

Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister of Israel, welcomed the decision and praised the announcement. On December 8, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson clarified that the President's statement \"did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem\" and \"was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide.\"\n\nTrump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital was rejected by a majority of world leaders. The United Nations Security Council held an emergency meeting on 7 December where 14 out of 15 members condemned Trump's decision, but the motion was vetoed by the United States. Britain, France, Sweden, Italy and Japan were among the countries who criticized Trump's decision at the emergency meeting. Other countries supported the move: Guatemala said that they will follow up and also relocate their embassy; Paraguay, the Czech Republic, Romania and Honduras said that they were considering relocation. The European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that all governments of EU member states were united on the issue of Jerusalem, and also reaffirmed their commitment to a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. Representatives from 32 countries were present at opening of the embassy, including EU members Austria, Czech Republic and Romania. \n\nPalestinian officials have said the announcement disqualifies the United States from peace talks, while Hamas called for a new intifada following Trump's declarations. Following the announcement there were demonstrations throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as in Iran, Jordan, Tunisia, Somalia, Yemen, Malaysia and Indonesia, and outside the U.S. embassy in Berlin. By December 25, 2017, Salafi groups had fired almost 30 rockets towards Israel from the Gaza Strip, with almost half landing inside Gaza. Two caused minor damage to property near Ashkelon and Sderot, and Hamas rounded up the Salafists thought responsible for the attacks.\n\nOn February 23, 2018, the State Department announced the new US embassy will open in May. The US embassy was officially opened in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018, coinciding with the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence. The location of the relocated embassy is at the former site of its consulate general in the Arnona neighborhood, in West Jerusalem.\n\nAfter the founding of the State of Israel in 1949, the United States recognized the new state, but considered it desirable to establish an international regime for Jerusalem, with its final status resolved through negotiations. The US opposed Israel's declaration of Jerusalem as its capital in 1949 and opposed Jordan's plan to make Jerusalem its second capital announced in 1950. The US also opposed Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem after the 1967 war. The official United States position has been that the future of Jerusalem should be the subject of a negotiated settlement. Subsequent administrations have maintained the position that Jerusalem's future not be the subject of unilateral actions that could prejudice negotiations, such as by moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\n\nDuring the 1992 presidential election Bill Clinton promised that his administration would \"support Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel\" and criticized President George H.W. Bush for having \"repeatedly challenged Israel’s sovereignty over a united Jerusalem.\" However, after the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, the Clinton administration did not proceed with their plans in order not to disturb the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nIn 1995, Congress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Act, which declared that \"Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel.\" The bill also stated that the American embassy should move to Jerusalem within five years. Backing the legislation was viewed by some as reflecting American domestic politics. Clinton opposed the Jerusalem Embassy Act and signed a waiver every six month delaying the move.\n\nDuring the 2000 election campaign, George W. Bush criticized Clinton for not moving the embassy as he had promised to do, and said he planned on initiating the process himself as soon as he was elected. However, once he took office, he backed down on his promise.\n\nIn 2008, then Democratic candidate Barack Obama called Jerusalem the 'capital of Israel'. On June 4, 2008, Obama told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), in his first foreign policy speech after capturing the Democratic nomination the day before, that \"Jerusalem will remain the capital of Israel, and it must remain undivided.\" However, he backtracked almost immediately, saying \"Well, obviously, it's going to be up to the parties to negotiate a range of these issues. And Jerusalem will be part of those negotiations.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 US Presidential election, one of Trump's campaign promises was to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which he described as the \"eternal capital of the Jewish people.\" On June 1, 2017, Trump signed a waiver on the Jerusalem Embassy Act, delaying the move of the US embassy to Jerusalem for another six months, as had every president before him since 1995. The White House stated that this would help them negotiate a deal between Israel and Palestine, and that the promised move would come at a later time.\n\nOn December 6, 2017 President Trump formally recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and stated that the American embassy would be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In his statement Donald Trump did not mention East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state, but he did say that United States recognition did not resolve the dispute over Jerusalem's borders. President Trump explicitly stated his support for maintaining the status quo of the holy sites within the Old City. Following the announcement, Trump signed the waiver, delaying the move by at least another six months.\n\nFollowing Trump's announcement, American embassies in Turkey, Jordan, Germany and Britain issued security alerts for Americans traveling or living in those countries. The United States also issues a general warning for Americans abroad about the possibility of violent protests. The American consulate in Jerusalem has restricted travel of government employees to Jerusalem's Old City. The US Embassy in Jordan banned employees from leaving the capital and children of embassy employees were told to stay home from school.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson later clarified that the President's statement \"did not indicate any final status for Jerusalem\" and \"was very clear that the final status, including the borders, would be left to the two parties to negotiate and decide.\" State Department officials said on December 8 that there will not be any immediate practical changes in how the US deals with Jerusalem, including its policy of not listing a country on the passports of citizens born in Jerusalem.\n\nWhen asked what country the Western Wall is in, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said \"We're not taking any position on the overall boundaries. We are recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.\"\n\nOut of 11 former US ambassadors to Israel, nine were critical of Trump's policy change. Ogden R. Reid who served as an ambassador to Israel from 1959 to 1961 was one of the exceptions saying, \"I think it's the right decision.\" Edward S. Walker Jr. who served from 1997 to 1999 also supported recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital: \"It's really a question of what are the lines, the borders, to be drawn around the state of Israel and the ultimate state of Palestine.\" Daniel C. Kurtzer noted America's international isolation in his remarks and Richard H. Jones expressed concerns that moving the embassy would fuel further violence. A number of former ambassadors, such as Martin S. Indyk stated that they were open to recognition of West Jerusalem as Israel's capital, provided Israel would agree to slow settlement construction and recognize East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.\n\nAmerican Christian organizations were divided: the National Council of Churches (NCC) which represents 38 different denominations issued a statement saying the change in policy was likely to exacerbate regional conflict and cost lives, while the Liberty Counsel, a right wing evangelical organization supported the decision. The move had been supported by many conservative American evangelical organizations and leaders including American Christian Leaders for Israel, Jerry Falwell, and Mike Huckabee. Johnnie Moore, one of Trump's evangelical advisers, said the announcement fulfilled a campaign promise to Trump's evangelical voter base. It was also welcomed by Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, the founder of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews.\n\nThe majority of prominent American Jewish organizations welcomed the move, including the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, which comprises 51 national Jewish organizations, as well as by a number of its member organizations: AIPAC, the Jewish Federations of North America, the American Jewish Congress, the American Jewish Committee, Hadassah, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America and the National Council of Young Israel. The Conservative Movement's US, Israel and global branches also welcomed US recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Orthodox Union, the US' largest umbrella organization representing Orthodox Jews, thanked Trump for \"beginning the process of relocating the US Embassy to Jerusalem.\" \n\nThe Anti-Defamation League said recognition was \"important and long overdue\", while continuing to express support for a two state solution. AIPAC expressed its support for an \"undivided Jerusalem\" but also said that relocating the American embassy to Jerusalem would not \"prejudge the outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process\". Morton Klein, who heads the Zionist Organization of America, said that Trump was \"finally recognizing the obvious\". The Simon Wiesenthal Center said Trump's announcement \"will right an historic wrong\". The announcement was also welcomed by the Republican Jewish Coalition.\n\nThe Reform Jewish movement called it \"ill-timed\" and said it would \"exacerbate the conflict\", but also declared that \"Jerusalem is the eternal capital of the Jewish people and the State of Israel\" and that they \"share the President's belief that the US embassy should, at the right time, be moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.\" The Jewish Democratic Council of America similarly expressed support for Israel as an undivided capital, but criticized Trump for neglecting to \"meaningfully support peace between Palestinians and Israelis.\" Left-wing Mideast policy group J Street said the timing was \"premature and divisive\". J Street, New Israel Fund, and progressive Zionist organization Ameinu expressed concerns that the move would undermine Middle East peace efforts and could lead to violence.\n\nIn December 2017, more than 130 Jewish studies scholars from across North America criticized the Trump administration's decision, calling on the U.S. government to take actions to de-escalate the tensions and \"clarify Palestinians' legitimate stake in the future of Jerusalem.\" According to \"Haaretz\", many of these scholars have been critical of the Trump administration and the current Israeli government.\n\nAmerican Muslim civil advocacy groups rejected the policy change, including the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC). On December 5, Muslim, Interfaith and human rights groups held a protest outside the White House.\n\nOn December 6, shortly after Trump's statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the announcement was a \"historic landmark\" and praised the decision as \"courageous and just\". During his remarks Netanyahu said there is \"no peace that doesn't include Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel\", adding that Jerusalem has \"been the capital of Israel for nearly 70 years\". He later said that he has heard condemnation about the announcement but has \"not heard any condemnation for the rocket firing against Israel that has come and the awful incitement against us\".\n\nThe announcement was well received by Knesset members of left, right and centre parties including Yesh Atid, Bayit Yehudi, Yisrael Beytenu, and Likud. Isaac Herzog called it an \"act of historic justice\" but also added that the next step was to \"realize the vision of two states\". In contrast, Bezalel Smotrich of the religious zionist Bayit Yehudi party issued the following statement: \"For 30 years we have fallen into the pit of the Palestinian state as a realistic solution. The time has come to rethink things\". Avi Gabbay, who was recently elected to lead the Zionist Union, also supported Trump's announcement, saying that recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is more important then a peace deal.\n\nIsrael's Deputy Education Minister Meir Porush of United Torah Judaism party said building in \"parts of Judea and Samaria and Jerusalem that need housing would be better than a declaration that means nothing\". Yisrael Eichler, also of UTJ, expressed similar views saying he would \"rather have 1,000 homes for young couples in Jerusalem than one American embassy building.\" In contrast, left-wing party Meretz said recognition of Jerusalem should only come with the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, adding that Trump's declaration \"de facto betrays the Zionist vision and the values on which the State of Israel was established\".\n\nHanin Zoabi and Ayman Odeh, both members of the United Arab List party, said the US could no longer act as a peace mediator. Odeh said that \"Trump is a pyromaniac and will set the entire region ablaze with his madness\".\n\nPalestinian officials said the announcement disqualifies the United States from peace talks. Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah said the policy change \"destroys the peace process\". Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas gave a speech where he said the decision meant the United States was \"abdicating its role as a peace mediator\". Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki similarly said the United States could no longer act as a mediator in the peace process because it had become a party to the dispute. Adnan al-Husayni asked the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.\n\nHamas called for a new intifada, but the response from Palestinians inside Jerusalem was relatively muted. Protests were held in East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. Palestinians burned portraits and effigies of Donald Trump and tore pictures of Salman bin Abdulaziz and Muhammad bin Salman in protest of the embassy move. The Israel military estimated that 3,000 people in the West Bank and 4,500 in the Gaza Strip participated in protests on December 8, 2017.\n\nThe Jerusalem announcement inspired activist Ahmed Abu Artema to write a Facebook proposing the outlines of the Great March of Return protests. Multiple camps of Palestinians engaged in protest along the fenceline of the Gaza Strip as part of this effort in late March 2018, demanding the right of Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to their former homes in Israel, and an end to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, as well as rejecting recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem on May 14 coincided with a major escalation of the protests, resulting in the death of 64 protesters on that day.\n\nOn December 6, 2017, the primate of the Greek Orthodox Church of Jerusalem, Patriarch Theophilos III, widely regarded as the most senior Christian figure in Jerusalem, and twelve other church leaders in the Holy Land sent a letter to Trump warning that his move “w[ould] yield increased hatred, conflict, violence and suffering in Jerusalem and the Holy Land, moving us farther from the goal of unity and deeper toward destructive division”. Apart from Theophilos III, the letter was signed by heads of Jerusalem's Syrian, Armenian, Ethiopioan and Coptic Orthodox patriarchates as well as the Roman Catholic Church's Apostolic Administrator for Jerusalem (the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem). It was also signed by the Franciscan Order, the Greek-Melkite-Catholic patriarchate, the Maronites, the Episcopal Church, the Armenian Catholic and Syrian Catholic churches and the Evangelical Lutherans.\n\nTrump's Jerusalem decision was widely condemned by world leaders. European US allies that objected include Britain, Germany, Italy and France. Romania, on the other hand, declined to follow the EU position and also indicated it may relocate its embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nPope Francis also made a plea that all nations remain committed to \"respecting the status quo\" of the city. China urged caution regarding the potential escalation of tensions in the Middle East.\n\nShortly before Trump's announcement, in November 2017, the United Nations General Assembly voted on a resolution in Jerusalem 151-6 with 9 abstentions. The resolution stated that \"any actions by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the Holy City of Jerusalem were illegal and therefore null and void. It further stressed the need for the parties to refrain from provocative actions, especially in areas of religious and cultural sensitivity, and called for respect for the historic status quo at the holy places of Jerusalem.\" It was part of six resolutions on Palestine and the Middle East.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council vote on 7 December to condemn Trump's decision failed due to a veto by the United States, despite the support of the remaining fourteen members of the Council. The emergency meeting was requested by Bolivia, Britain, Egypt, France, Italy, Senegal, Sweden and Uruguay. US envoy Nikki Haley called the United Nations \"one of the world's foremost centers of hostility towards Israel\". Britain, France, Sweden, Italy and Japan were among the countries who criticized Trump's decision at the emergency meeting. On 18 December, a Security Council resolution calling for the withdrawal of the recognition was vetoed by the United States, for a tally of 14–1.\n\nOn 21 December 2017, the General Assembly voted for Resolution ES-10/L.22 by 128–9, with 35 abstentions and 21 absences, to condemn the US declaration on the status of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and enjoin other states to refrain from setting up diplomatic offices in Jerusalem. None of the United States' NATO allies opposed the resolution, with 25 of 29 voting for it.\n\nThe European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini emphasized that all governments of EU member states were united on the issue of Jerusalem, and reaffirmed their commitment to a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. Mogherini said that embassies should not be moved to Jerusalem while the final status of the city was disputed. She also noted that Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem was considered a violation of international law under a 1980 United Nations Security Council resolution. On December 11, Mogherini said that European nations would not move their embassies to Jerusalem.\n\nThe EU countries of Austria, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic however defied the official EU stance and attended the official reception on the opening of the US embassy in Jerusalem. In addition, the non-EU European countries of Albania, Macedonia, Serbia and Ukraine also attended the opening.\n\nTrump's recognition of Jerusalem did receive some European support from anti-Islam politicians. Czech President Miloš Zeman said the European response was \"cowardly\". Geert Wilders, leader of the Dutch anti-Islam party Party for Freedom, said that \"all freedom loving countries should move their embassy to Jerusalem\" and affirmed his support for an undivided Jerusalem. Heinz-Christian Strache, leader of the Austrian Freedom Party, similarly stated his wish to relocate the Austrian embassy to Jerusalem.\n\nKing Salman of Saudi Arabia said that moving the American embassy to Jerusalem would be a \"flagrant provocation\" to Muslims. Saudi Arabia and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi both expressed similar concerns about the viability of the peace process. The Jordanian government said Trump had violated international law and the UN charter. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called Israel a \"terrorist state\".\n\nOn December 10, The Arab League held an emergency meeting in Cairo. After the meeting, the League's Secretary-General, Ahmed Aboul Gheit issued a statement saying the change in US policy was \"against international law and \"amounts to the legalization\" of Israeli occupation. Gheit also questioned US commitment to the peace process.\n\nIran said the U.S. announcement was in violation of international resolutions and could spark a \"new intifada\". Lebanese President Michel Aoun said the policy change would derail the peace process. Qatar's Foreign Minister Mohammed Abdulrahman Al Thani called it \"a death sentence for all who seek peace\". Indonesian President Joko Widodo condemned the decision and asked the US to \"reconsider the decision\". Malaysian PM Najib Razak similarly did so, stating that \"we strongly oppose any recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital for all time\".\n\nOn December 13, 2017, during an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) meeting held in Istanbul, more than 50 Muslim majority countries rejected and condemned Trump's decision by passing the \"Istanbul Declaration on Freedom for al Quds\" (\"Jerusalem\" in Arabic) and calling for the worldwide recognition of \"an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its occupied capital\". Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas stated at the summit that the United States is no longer fit to participate in the Middle East peace process because of its bias and cannot be accepted as a \"fair negotiator\". While the summit did not produce any concrete sanctions against Israel or the United States, \"The New York Times\" called the declaration \"the strongest response yet\" to Trump's decision. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) urges its members to join in the Arab League boycott of Israel.\n\nPope Tawadros II of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria cancelled a meeting with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence in protest of the American decision. The Coptic Church issued a statement that Trump's decision \"did not take into account the feelings of millions of Arab people\".\n\nJihadist movements from around the world responded with calls for armed struggle:Al-Qaeda in North Africa issued a statement exhorting all fighters to make the liberation of Palestine their central goal. Kashmiri group Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind called on Muslims worldwide to attack embassies of the US and Israel as well as harm the financial interests of both countries. The Egyptian Hasm Movement called for an uprising. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula called on Muslims to support Palestinians with money and weaponry. The Taliban in Afghanistan called the US move \"anti-Muslim bigotry\". Somalia-based Al-Shabaab exhorted Muslims to respond with weapons.\n\nThe Taliban and Shia extremist leaders likewise expressed their opposition. ISIL issued a response on December 8, which mainly focused on criticizing other jihadist groups and Arab leaders. They accused rival groups of politicizing the conflict to serve personal agendas and argued for the defeat of Israel's Arab neighbours who, according to ISIL, \"surround [Israel] the same way a bracelet surrounds the wrist, protecting the Jews from the strikes of the mujahideen.\"\n\nChina has historically supported an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and said that this position remains unchanged in the aftermath of Trump's announcement. Following the announcement, Chinese state media aired lengthy broadcasts emphasizing Palestinian opposition to it and lack of support for the move among America's European allies. Chinese news reports also stressed the risk of \"instability and uncertainty\" in the Middle East. Some analysts have argued that moving the embassy could push Israel to make concessions to the Palestinians in final status negotiations. The Chinese embassy issued an alert to travellers regarding the increasingly complicated and intense safety conditions in Israel after the announcement.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolás Maduro defined the announcement on national television before travelling to Istanbul to preside a Non-Aligned Movement summit to discuss the position as \"an illegal declaration, absolutely illegal, I would say irrational. A true provocation, a war declaration to the Arab people, to the Muslim people\"\n\nFollowing the announcement, right-wing Zionist organization World Betar called for international recognition of the Temple Mount, Nablus and Hebron.\n\nOn December 24, Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said that his country would relocate its embassy to Jerusalem. The Guatemalan embassy was moved on May 16, two days after the American embassy was moved.\n\nSeveral national governments responded directly to the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018. Japan and Malaysia were among those expressing concern that the relocation could escalate tensions, while Russia and Venezuela added that the move contradicted existing international agreements.\n\nProtests were held in many places across the world during the weekend of December 16 and 17. Crowds in the United States, Pakistan, Netherlands, Germany, Lebanon, Jordan, Australia, Montenegro, Iran, Morocco, Poland, United Kingdom, Greece and Indonesia gathered to protest against the decision.\n\nIn Bethlehem, religious leaders turned off Christmas tree lights outside the Church of the Nativity for three days to protest Trump's announcement.

On December 11, the Israeli Defense Forces reported that two rockets were fired into Israel from the Gaza Strip. On December 12, two Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine militants were killed in an explosion initially claimed to be a drone strike, however the IDF denied this and a later Islamic Jihad statement claimed this was an accident.\n\nIsraeli Air Force targeted three Hamas facilities on early morning of December 14 in response to rockets fired from Gaza hours earlier on the previous day with one landing in an open field of Eshkol Regional Council, two shot down and one falling inside a school in Gaza's Beit Hanoun, damaging a classroom. According to a Palestinian security official, the Hamas sites struck by Israeli military suffered major damage and some nearby homes suffered light damage, amidst reports of light injuries.\n\nOn December 14, after Israel shut its border crossing with Gaza, tens of thousands of Palestinians and militants attended a Hamas rally in Gaza.

Nearly 400 were injured in clashes according to the ministry.\n\nTwo Palestinians were killed and 120 injured in clashes on December 22, according to Palestinian Health Ministry. The IDF issued a statement which said that 2,000 protesters had faced off with the troops at the Gaza border fence, hurling rocks as well as burning tires at the troops.\n\nPalestinian rocket fire from Gaza in December 2017 was the most intensive series of rocket attacks on Israel since Operation Protective Edge. As of January 1, 2018, Palestinian militants from Gaza had fired at least 18 rockets at Israel. Per Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, IDF has struck 40 Hamas targets in response. Per IDF's Chief-of-Staff Gadi Eizenkot, 20 rockets had been fired in December 2017.\n\nMost of the rockets fired from Gaza did not land in Israeli territory, but some have landed near residential areas like Sderot and Ashkelon. Israel launched air raids on Hamas's military targets in Gaza in response and, according to \"Haaretz\", Hamas responded by arresting and probably torturing Salafi militants in the Gaza Strip to prevent further rocket fire.\n\nTwo Palestinians were killed on January 11 in clashes with Israel troops, one each in Gaza and West Bank. Israeli military said rioters had put their forces in danger in Gaza. In the other cases, it said troops fired at the main instigator after being attacked with rocks, though PA official Ghassan Daghlas however claimed it to be an unprovoked attack. This took the death toll to 16 Palestinians and one Israeli since Trump's declaration.\n\nFollowing the announcement there were demonstrations in Iran, Jordan, Tunisia, Somalia, Yemen, Malaysia and Indonesia.
