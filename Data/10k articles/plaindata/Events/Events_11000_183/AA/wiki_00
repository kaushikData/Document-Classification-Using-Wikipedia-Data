Perpetrated on the island of Paros, Greece, the case became notorious at a time of rising concern about the increasing numbers of illegal immigrants arriving in the country. Injuries to the victim, usually referred to in the Greek press solely by her first name \"Myrto\" (), resulted in permanent disability.\n\nOn 23 July 2012 a teenage girl, Myrto Papadomichelaki (), was found half naked, beaten and in a coma, on one of the most popular beaches in the Greek island, Paros. Her head had been bashed in with a rock weighing 5 kilos. The authorities ordered the girl to be transferred to a hospital in Athens so that she would have the best of care and started looking for evidence in the crime scene in order to find the assaulter. At first, police investigated the incident as an accident. However, when the forensic specialist from Athens, Dr. Nikos Kalogrias announced that he had found semen over the girl’s body, the focus of the investigation changed to rape and near-fatal beating.\n\nAccording to the police report, initially the suspects were 12 men, Greeks and foreigners, who either worked by the beach and the crime scene or had been seen by witnesses in the area. As the investigation continued, the suspects were narrowed to four and police concluded, with the help of several eyewitnesses, that the suspect was a man who worked by the crime scene. Specifically the mother of the teenage girl reported that she saw a man, wearing white trousers and a colorful shirt, walking away from the crime scene. Ahmed Waqas's co-workers said that he was wearing this kind of clothes at work the day of the incident. However, Ahmed had already left the island to go to Athens, ostensibly because of the serious illness of one of his relatives. Ahmed was picked up during a random check in Athens and DNA was used to identify him as the likely culprit. A gardener, Ahmed had told his Paros employers that he had to leave the island to visit an ailing family member.\n\nA few days later the police arrested Ahmed Waqas, in Nea Chalkidona, Athens, along with two other illegal immigrants. Police located suspect through his mobile phone and with the help of other immigrants. The police compared DNA obtained from Ahmed's saliva with DNA that found on the girl's clothes and body and confirmed a match, after which Ahmed confessed his crime. Ahmed Waqas was reportedly calm and emotionless while describing the events of the crime to the police officers. As he stated, his first intention was to steal the girl's mobile phone but she tried to repel his attack. Then, he started beating her with a rock until she fell unconscious. While the girl could not fight anymore he raped her and then beat her again against the stones.\n\nThe perpetrator had been scheduled for voluntary repatriation to Pakistan at the time of the arrest.\n\nAfter his confession, Ahmed Waqas was taken to the island of Syros where he testified again before the district prosecutor. While the police accompanied him from the ferry to the prosecutor's office, passersby shouted slogans against him. Supporters of the Greek nationalist party, Golden Dawn were in the angry crowd shouting denunciations of the rapist. The political demonstrations that surrounded the transportation and trial of the perpetrator had a significant impact. Police, in fear of any reprisal actions, started an operation of localization of any illegal immigrants in down town Athens having as a goal the \"cleaning\" of the capital's center and the deportation of all illegals. Minister of Citizen Protection, Nikos Dendias, stated that \"the detention and deportation will continue until the center of Athens is \"clean\"\", did not please the nationalist party, Golden Dawn which published the following announcement:\nEnough with illegal immigrants! The horrible crime against a minor Greek was committed again by an illegal immigrant. The need for multiple deterrence measures is immediate. Any crime committed by an illegal alien must be statutory. Whoever talks about racism, should host the criminals at his home. The only racism that exists, is the racism against the Greeks.\nAs suspect was being transported from Syros to the port of Piraeus, near Athens, members of Golden Dawn, angered not only by the rape and attempted murder, but by the fact that the culprit appeared to have lied about his age to secure trial in the juvenile justice system, attempted to pull him from the police car in which he was being transported, allegedly in order to lynch him.\n\nAfter the initial trial, the perpetrator was discovered to have lied about his age in order to be tried and punished as a juvenile.\n\nThe defendant, an illegal immigrant, initially convinced authorities that he was a minor so that he could be adjudicated by a juvenile court. He first reported that he was born in 1991, then in 1993 and finally he stated that he was born in 1995. His inconsistency made the investigator ask the prosecutor to add those false statements to the prosecution. However Ahmed did not change his attitude and continued lying, as a result, the court's initial judgement was for him to be held in prison for two years.\n\nThe trial was a national news story in Greece. Perpetrator was sentenced to, \"a life sentence for the robbery, 18 years in jail for the attempted homicide, 18 years in jail for the rape and three months in jail for illegal employment\".\n\nAn item in the online magazine ΠΑΡΑΔΡΑΣΗ condemned \"treacherous and anti-Greek Leftwing\" demonstrators who gathered outside the courthouse to protest on behalf of the rights of illegal immigrants. The courtroom, holding cell, court offices, courthouse and vehicles transporting the confessed rapist had to be tightly guarded throughout the legal proceedings.\n\nCrowds gathered outside the courthouse at every stage in the trial, to protest against illegal immigration, to defend the rights of illegal immigrants, and, finally, to show solidarity with the family on the day the sentence was read.\n\nTens of thousands of dollars were raised by the Greek public to pay for the victim's medical care.\n\n, the teenage girl was out of the coma and was working to regain her strength and abilities in a rehabilitation center. Three years after the attack, she remained unable to walk or to feed herself.\n\nAndreas Lykourentzos, Greek Minister for Health, announced in May 2013 that the victim would be transferred to a hospital in the United States to undergo advanced treatment at the expense of the Greek government. A decision continued by Greek Minister for Health, Adonis Georgiadis. Nevertheless, private funds were required and the money was raised by the Greek-American community in the United States to fund Myrto Papadomichelaki's treatment at Harvard's Children's and Spaulding Hospitals in Boston.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the rape, Nikos Dendias, Minister for Civil Protection, announced a program to detain and deport illegal immigrants from central Athens. Hundreds of illegal immigrants including dozens of Pakistanis were immediately rounded up and deported from Athens.\n\nThe attack and rape of a 15-year-old Greek girl by an illegal immigrant is considered to have \"played into\" the (Golden Dawn) party’s hands.\n\nAnger over this rape and \"attempted murder\" is said to have stoked a wave of assaults on foreigners, including the incident in which Iraq Aladin, an illegal immigrant from Iraq was stabbed and beaten to death by five masked hoodlums on Aug. 12, 2012. Anti-immigration parties in other European countries publicized the incident as a rallying point, including the British National Party.\n\n"}

Action items are discrete units that can be handled by a single person.\n\nAction items are usually created during a discussion by a group of people who are meeting about one or more topics and during the discussion it is discovered that some kind of action is needed. The act required is then documented as an action item and usually assigned to someone, usually a member of the group. The person to whom the action is assigned is then obligated to perform the action and report back to the group on the results.\n\nAction items are usually documented in the meeting minutes and are recorded in the task list of the group. As people complete action items, the items are documented as being completed and the item is removed from the list of outstanding action items.\n\nThere are many attributes that can be associated with an action item - e.g.:\n\nA usual format for an action item is to record an action item number, the date when the action item is identified or created, the name of the person to whom the action is assigned, a title description of the action, a more detailed description of the action and its outcomes, and its deliverables.\n\nAn action item can be considered a more general form of various types of action/issue/defect tracking methods. For instance, a bug report is a form of action item as is a service report created by a service company to track a problem reported by a customer or an RMA number.\n\nFollow up in a consistent and timely manner with the responsible individual(s) to track their progress and drive the action item to resolution.\n\nIt is important to understand the distinction here that we track to resolution and not to completion. While it is the goal to have every action item completed, there are numerous scenarios in which the action item may no longer be relevant or completion may not be possible.\n\nThere are a number of software applications for tracking action items or service reports. These applications are used within software development organizations as well as in customer support functions. Because these software applications facilitate group communication, they are often referred to as Collaborative software or groupware.. Various such software are available in the market. They are known to increase the productivity of Managers.\n\nMany information technology support groups use some kind of service report software so that when a trouble report is called in, the person answering the telephone will create a trouble ticket to track the issue. The trouble ticket is assigned to a member of the IT services organization who then visits the person who has reported a problem and resolves the problem. The IT services person will then close out the trouble ticket indicating the issue has been resolved.\n\nRecent research at the Computational Semantics Lab at Stanford University seeks to automatically identify action items and extract their properties (the \"what\", \"who\", and \"when\" of the action item) using automatic speech recognition transcripts from spontaneous, multi-party conversations during meetings.\n\n"}

He succeeded his father, Ashot IV Bagratuni, as ruler of Taron in 826, and was named presiding prince by the Abbasid Caliph in 830. In 849 he began an open rebellion against Abbasid authority in Armenia. The rebellion provoked the dispatch of Bugha al-Kabir to the country, who crushed the revolt in a three-year campaign. Bagrat was treacherously captured during negotiations in 851 and brought captive to the Abbasid capital Samarra. He was succeeded in Taron by his sons, while the title of presiding prince passed to his nephew, the future King Ashot I of Armenia.\n\nBagrat was the eldest son of Ashot IV Bagratuni, who by the time of his death in 826 had come to control a large part of Armenia, and was recognized by the Abbasid caliphs as presiding prince (\"ishkhan\") of Armenia. After his death, Bagrat and his brother Smbat divided their father's inheritance between them: Bagrat took the regions of Taron, Khoith and Sassoun, i.e. the family's domains on the Upper Euphrates, while Smbat received the ancestral lands around Bagaran and the Araxes river. In a calculated effort to keep the two brothers divided, the Abbasid government divided Ashot's authority and conferred on Smbat the title of commander-in-chief (\"sparapet\"), while Bagrat was named presiding prince four years after his father's death. Bagrat was also probably the first presiding prince to bear the title of \"prince of princes\" (\"ishkhan ishkhanats\") instead of just \"prince of Armenia\".\n\nAbbasid calculations proved correct, as the two brothers spent much time quarrelling with each other. In 841, for instance, Bagrat had the Armenian bishops depose the Catholicos of Armenia, John IV, but he was promptly re-installed in his see by Smbat with the assistance of the other princes. Nevertheless, the Armenian princes were able to use the Caliphate's preoccupation with the Khurramite rebellion of Babak Khorramdin to achieve a significant degree of autonomy during this period. Smbat, who had spent time at the caliphal court as a hostage, was more circumspect about openly challenging Arab power than his brother, but both were ultimately too weak to seriously threaten Abbasid predominance for the time being. Thus Bagrat participated in the great campaign of Caliph al-Mu'tasim against the Byzantine Empire in 838, and even fought in the Battle of Dazimon against Emperor Theophilos. In 841, on the other hand, under the leadership of the \"sparapet\" Smbat, the Armenians revolted against the appointment as caliphal governor of Khalid ibn Yazid al-Shaybani, who in his previous tenures had become enormously unpopular among both the Christian and the Arab princes of the country. The rebels achieved his recall by the Caliph and his replacement with the weaker and more pliant Ali ibn Husayn, to whom the Armenians not only refused to hand over the expected taxes, but whom they promptly blockaded in his capital, Bardaa.\n\nIn this way, throughout the reign of Caliph al-Wathiq (842–847), Armenia remained outside effective Abbasid control, but the accession of the energetic al-Mutawakkil in 847 brought to the throne a ruler determined to reimpose Abbasid authority. In 849, the Caliph appointed a new governor of \"Arminiya\", Abu Sa'id Muhammad al-Marwazi. As he moved to enter Armenia with his army, however, he was met on the border by envoys from Bagrat with gifts and with the promised tribute, in a move calculated to prevent the Arab tax collectors from entering the country. This was an act of open revolt by Bagrat, but Abu Sa'id preferred for the moment to withdraw rather than enter the province. In the next year, Abu Sa'id sent two local Arab lords, al-Ala ibn Ahmad al-Azdi and Musa ibn Zurara, the lord of Arzn, who was married to a sister of Bagrat, to subdue the two southern provinces of Taron and Vaspurakan on the pretext of raising taxes. This resulted in open conflict between the Arabs and Bagrat and the Artzruni ruler of Vaspurakan, Ashot I. Ashot defeated al-Ala and evicted him from his territory, and then went to the assistance of Bagrat. The Armenian armies faced and defeated Musa near the capital of Taron, Mush, and pursued him until Baghesh, stopping only after the entreaties of Musa's wife, the sister of Bagrat. The Armenians then proceeded to massacre the Arab settlers in Aghdznik, prompting the Caliph to intervene in force. Abu Sa'id launched a new expedition in 851 but died on the way, and his son, Yusuf, assumed leadership of the caliphal expedition. The arrival of the Abbasid army in his lands led Ashot Artzruni to prefer a separate peace with the Arabs, forcing Bagrat too to enter into negotiations with Yusuf. During the talks, however, with the connivance of his brother, he was seized and brought to the caliphal capital of Samarra.\n\nBagrat's arrest provoked his subjects into killing Yusuf the next year. Al-Mutawakkil responded by sending a large army under the Turkic general Bugha al-Kabir into the country. Over the course of three years, Bugha methodically re-occupied and subdued the whole province of \"Arminiya\", from the southern regions of Taron and Vaspurakan up to the principalities of Caucasian Albania and most of Iberia in the north. The princes of Armenia remained divided and focused on their own personal rivalries, facilitating the Abbasid re-conquest by fighting alongside the Caliph's troops and handing over their rivals into captivity. The re-imposition of Abbasid authority was also marked by tens of thousands of executions among the male fighting population, and did not spare the princely families, whether Christian or Muslim, either: by the time of Bugha's return to Samarra in 855, most of the princes of Armenia were captives in the Caliph's court along with their sons. Nevertheless, gradually, the Armenian princes were released and their lands restored to them or their sons: Bagrat was succeeded by his sons Ashot and David as rulers of Taron, although a portion of the region seems to have passed to a member of the Artzruni family, Gurgen I Artzruni the son of Abu Belj. The title of \"sparapet\" was given to Ashot V Bagratuni, son of Smbat, who in 862 also became \"prince of princes\", leading eventually to his establishment of the virtually independent Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia in 884.\n\n"}
{"id": "6050003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6050003", "title": "Beenz.com", "text": "Beenz.com\n\nBeenz.com was a web site that allowed consumers to earn beenz, a type of online currency, for performing activities such as visiting a web site, shopping online, or logging on through an Internet service provider. The beenz e-currency could then be spent with participating online merchants.\n\nThe marketing and brand concept positioned Beenz as ‘the web's currency,’ global money that would challenge the world’s major currencies. The Beenz management team raised almost $100 million from venture capitalists including Apax/Patrickof, Larry Ellison of Oracle, Francois Pinault of PPR, Vivendi Universal, Italian financier Carlo de Benedetti and Hikari Tsushin of Japan.\n\nSince launching a new currency is illegal in many countries, beenz management and its legal teams had to meet with finance ministers across Europe to assure them that Beenz would be categorized as virtual points. Within days of its launch in the UK, Beenz' offices in London were visited by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) on suspicion of operating an unlicensed bank (apparently the FSA misunderstood that the 'Bank of Beenz' on the website was, in fact, just a marketing name for the user account area. The company agreed to change this to 'My Beenz' and the FSA was satisfied). Beenz received several awards for its marketing campaign.\n\nBeenz operated in the United States, Sweden, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Australia and China. At its peak, there were offices in 15 countries, and translations of the beenz website into several languages.\n\nAfter the dot-com bubble burst, the company replaced its CEO, Philip Letts, with a team including the founder, Charles Cohen, and other Board directors Stephen Limpe, Don McGuire and Sean Lane. The company could not go public, further funding did not materialise, and the company was sold to US-based Carlson Marketing Group in 2001 for an undisclosed sum.\n\nCarlson planned to integrate the beenz system into the customer relationship management tools they offered to clients. After the sale of the company to Carlson, beenz account holders were given a period of time to redeem their beenz before it became integrated. Competitors like Amazon who, along Visa, built systems allowing direct online payments via debit or credit cards, meant many of Beenz clients moved to these new platforms, and Beenz eventually lost most of its clients.\n\nCarlson did not renew the domain name.\nIn June 2008, CNET counted Beenz among the greatest dotcom disasters.\n\nAmongst the company's partnerships was one with MasterCard enabling holders of the 'rewardz card' to transfer earned beenz to their credit card account. This was one of the first relationships of its kind between a traditional finance company and a dot-com enterprise.\n\nBeenz was also once aligned with the now-defunct Speedyclick.com, which carried its own virtual currency. Beenz could be converted into SpeedyBucks, but not vice versa.\n\nThe inventor of Beenz was Charles Cohen, from the UK. He co-founded the parent company and joined forces with former reality television star Neil Forrester, whom Cohen had met whilst the pair were students at Oxford University. After tossing around the idea of Beenz and trying to get it off the ground Charles joined forces with Dave King, John Hogg, and Philip Letts to take Beenz forward. They quickly divided roles - Charles would take on the tasks of website development becoming CTO, Dave was Head of Sales and Philip became CEO, John Hogg headed Marketing. Philip took on Nicolas De Santis to develop the much vaunted Beenz logo and brand vision. After an intensive period of fundraising Beenz launched with a guerilla marketing campaign designed by the crew and Nick Band of Band and Brown. John Hogg moved over and De Santis became Chief Marketing Officer. Letts led Beenz to raise nearly 100 million dollars and spearheaded the expansion worldwide. He moved head office to New York from London and brought on Philippe Cothier as European president, Mitch Feigen as US president and opened an Asian division.\n\nLetts left Beenz after closing the last big round of over 30 million and went on to run Tradaq.com, a business-to-business exchange that allowed companies to buy and sell products and services without using cash.\n\nDe Santis left a few months after that and took on Chief Marketing Officer of Opodo.\n\nCohen used his experience with Beenz.com to write a book in 2002 called \"Corporate Vices: What's Gone Wrong With Business\" (). He now runs Probability plc in the UK, a mobile gambling business that he co-founded in 2004. Before beenz Cohen worked with Thought Interactive (a web design business). Initially, the concept was heavily dependent on the English speaking world and to change that the company recruited such characters as the Swedish entrepreneur Mikael Karlmark to launch its first non-English subsidiary.\n\nThe company used an innovative guerilla marketing campaign to get the word out in the early days. Instead of distributing a flyer in a conventional way, the company hired magicians and sleight-of-hand experts to slip the flyers surreptitiously into the pockets of members of the public. The flyers depicted \"Billy Beenz\", the fictional company mascot. Billy had a shock of red hair and a goofy expression.\n\nThere was some controversy when it transpired that the flyer distributors were specifically targeting drunk people, in an effort to make their task easier. There were many reports of people waking up after a night of drinking to find the Billy Beenz flyer mysteriously in their pocket.. Much of this marketing and was headed up by Beenz in-house marketing director Lyndon Ogden, formerly of Unisys.\n\nThe beenz business model was based upon arbitrage. Companies purchased beenz from the company at a locally determined exchange rate. They could then award these to consumers for actions to which the issuer attached value, such as making on-line purchases. Beenz were collected by the user clicking on a Java Applet and entering their email address linked to a beenz account. Consumers were then able to use their beenz to purchase goods from online merchants. Each merchant was free to exchange beenz at any notional value they liked, the company assuming that the market would settle the exchange value of each beenz. Merchants were then able to sell beenz back to the company itself at a pre-defined exchange rate. The company made its margin on the spread between the sell and the buy price of beenz in the market. In the later stages, a professional economist was employed to model the behaviour of prices and flows of money in this micro-economy, and keep it healthy.\n\nCohen's stated long term aim was eventually to allow consumers to purchase beenz directly from the company and for the \"beenz economy\" to eventually resemble that of a real economy. However, at the time, this was fraught with difficulty as some countries (such as France) expressed a view that such alternative currency schemes were undesirable and that they would seek to prevent them from operating.\n\n\n"}

It aired on August 10, 2007, in the United States and on October 22, 2007, in the UK. During the week-long special \"Ben 10 week\" in April 2008, it was revealed that this movie serves as the official finale to the series even though it was aired months before the last eight episodes and the last one which was non-canon of the fourth season. It was released to DVD on May 20, 2008 exclusively at Walmart stores. However, neither of the alternate versions were on the disc, merely the original with Heatblast, but the fourth season DVD contains all four versions, plus the pop up trivia version. The film comprises the three episodes of the fourth season, and is a finale to the series canonically.\n\nDuring a battle with Dr. Animo, Ben Tennyson's destruction of the scientist's \"DNA bomb\" accidentally sets off a self-destruct protocol in the Omnitrix. Its activation alerts Tetrax Shard, a bounty hunter and ally, who travels with his alien slime -like pilot Gluto to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn't figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip, but Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix's creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. During the journey, Tetrax hopes Ben would stop being a hero when the Omnitrix stop the countdown and Azmuth would shut it up for good. Ben is upset that he'll never be a hero again. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis (Vilgax's species) named Myaxx, who is Azmuth's assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth's when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe's inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to Xenon, where he is currently hiding on. However, Ben's archenemy Vilgax, who has escaped the Null Void, also picks up on the Omnitrix's self-destruct signal, picks up Sixsix, one of Tetrax's rivals, and starts tracking Ben.\n\nWhile attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though Gluto is supposedly killed in the conflict while protecting Gwen, who blames Ben. Tetrax's ship crashes on Azmuth's homeworld. As they enter his mountain fortress, they are attacked by a group of Florauna (Wildvine's species) which capture Gwen. Ben is depressed, and blames himself.\n\nAs Ben reluctantly proceeds with Tetrax and Myaxx down towards Azmuth's lair, Tetrax empathizes with Ben, revealing his origins of how working for Vilgax cost him his whole planet and everyone he's ever cared for. Tracking down Azmuth to a sealed secondary laboratory, Ben asks him to shut down the Omnitrix, but Azmuth, unconcerned about anything around him, refuses. Angry, Ben breaks down the wall with Cannonbolt and attacks him, revealing Azmuth to be an old, curmudgeonly Galvan (Grey Matter's species) hiding inside a large mechanical suit. As far as Azmuth is concerned, the whole universe deserves whatever it gets for misusing the Omnitrix. He tells them the Omnitrix was designed to be the ultimate device of peace and understanding. Everyone else made it a problem, only seeing it as the ultimate weapon.\n\nVilgax, having recovered from his earlier defeat, leads a massive attack on Azmuth's mountain fortress. During the fight, Gwen and Gluto reappear, Ben runs over to hug Gwen and Gluto having regenerated from some leftover material that splashed on Gwen's clothes and subsequently helping her to escape. Ben's actions during the battle renew Azmuth's faith in the universe, so he repairs the Omnitrix and he tells Ben that everyone thought Ben would never be hero if he stop the countdown, but Azmuth never said Ben would stop being a hero when the countdown stop. He gives Ben a brand-new form to use: Way Big, a skyscraper-sized alien modeled after Ultraman, who easily repels Vilgax's army of drones and angrily tosses the villain into space.\n\nWith the threat over, Ben offers to return the Omnitrix to Azmuth, who is leaving Xenon with Myaxx. Azmuth, however, sees Ben as the best place for the Omnitrix to be, both because he is technically fulfilling its original intention and because the Omnitrix attracts trouble simply by virtue of its existence. Tetrax returns Ben and Gwen to Earth, leaving Ben with a new hoverboard to replace the one Ben destroyed during his battle with Animo. Tetrax is disappointed that Ben will continue being a hero and he begins to accept Ben. The Tennysons' hope of having a normal day of recreation, however, is dashed by a newsflash of 'zombies' attacking the mall, leading them to rush to the rescue calling this a normal life for the Tennysons.\n\n\"Ben 10: Secret of the Omnitrix\" was released three different times, each featuring a different alien destroying Animo's DNA bomb. Ben uses Heatblast in the first, a new form called Eye Guy in the second, and XLR8 in the third. A fourth version (actually a special version of the Ditto edition) released on the Ben 10 4th season and the movie's DVDs features trivia inserts inserted in the film.\n\n\n"}

Four of the bids were subsequently withdrawn by 1 October 2014, citing either the high costs of hosting the Games or the lack of local support, leaving Almaty, Kazakhstan and Beijing, China as the only two remaining candidate cities. Beijing was then elected as the host city at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on 31 July 2015.\n\nOn 3 October 2012, the IOC announced in a letter to the NOCs the bidding calendar for the 2022 Winter Olympics:\nNote that the selected candidate cities have slightly changed venues plan in the final proposal to the IOC. Almaty moved technical alpine skiing events from Shymbulak to Tau, and completely removed both Kok Zhaylau and Ak-Bulak ski resorts, previously proposed for snowboarding and freestyle skiing events. Beijing dropped both Taiwu and Wanlong ski resorts, and proposed hosting snowboarding and freestyle skiing events in the two venues (A and B) in Genting Snow Park.\n\nAll data come from applicant cities bid books. candidate cities public support data has been updated.\n\nEach cell of the table provides a minimum and a maximum figure obtained by the applicant city on the specific criteria. These figures are to be compared to a benchmark which has been set at 6.\n\nOn 15 November 2013, the IOC announced the list of the six applicant cities. On 7 July 2014, the IOC announced that there were three remaining applicant cities that would move on to the candidate phase; these were Almaty, Beijing and Oslo.\n\nOn 1 October 2014, Oslo withdrew its application after one of the country's governing political parties Høyre decided not to support the application. The remaining two candidate cities were therefore Almaty and Beijing.\n\nBoth of the candidate cities suggested hosting the Games between February 4–20, 2022. The Paralympics will be held from March 4–13. While another city suggested hosting the Games between February 11–27, 2022. The Paralympics will be held from March 11–20.\n\nSince 2011, the National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan has been considering a bid for the 2022 games in Almaty, the former longtime capital city and still the largest city and financial centre of the country. Kazakhstan hosted the 2011 Asian Winter Games. Almaty will host 2017 Winter Universiade. The current Kazakh capital Astana considered to joint bid with Almaty but the idea was later declined. On 17 August 2013, Almaty announced they were bidding for the 2022 Games. Under the slogan \"Keeping it Real\", Almaty has emphasized her traditional winter setting with tall mountains and plenty of natural snow coverage as well as compactness — most venues are within half an hour's travel through Alpine scenery.\n\nPresenting Kazakhstan's bid at the final event in Kuala Lumpur, Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Karim Massimov made a powerful speech with a key message that Almaty was \"not a risk choice for 2022\", but \"a golden opportunity to prove that smaller advancing nations can successfully host the winter games\". He called to the OCI core values saying that letting Almaty host the Games was \"a golden opportunity to showcase the real long-term power of Olympic legacy for a region that has never hosted the Games\".\nIn the final voting Almaty lost to Beijing by only 4 votes.\n\nOn 5 November 2013, the Chinese Olympic Committee announced that it would submit a bid for Beijing to host the 2022 Winter Olympics. Beijing (where the indoor ice sports and the ceremonies would take place), was the host city of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Zhangjiakou would host the outdoor snow events.\n\nBefore the final voting in Kuala Lumpur Beijing's bid was presented by Yang Lan, a renowned former CCTV host, who said sports and fitness were becoming a new fashion trend in China. In her speech she focused on China's economy and its ability to support every commitment it made \"protecting long time financial viability and the reputation of the Games\". \n\nOn 6 November 2013, the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports announced that Oslo would be submitted as the Norwegian candidate for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Oslo last hosted the 1952 Winter Olympics, and Norway last hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer. On 1 October 2014 the Conservative Party decided that they would not support a bid for the games citing costs and lack of public support. A vast number of polls were conducted, and since April 2014 support had varied between 24% and 37%. The days leading up to the deliberation in the Conservative Party had consisted of a series of negative developments for the bid. Those negative developments included the Centre Party saying no through a grass root vote, a poll showing that even within the Norwegian Confederation of Sports the majority of members opposed the bid, an external revision which clarified that the newly suggested cheaper budget was unrealistic and public scrutiny on IOC´s 7000 pages of demands.\n\nNorway rejected the olympic committee's application for government funding to hold the event in Norway after the private organisation IOC made a large number of demands which caused a scandal in Norway. The demands notably included \"diva-like demands for luxury treatment\" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and a cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; \"Slate\" described the IOC as a \"notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats.\"\n\nOn 7 November 2013, the Polish Olympic Committee announced they submitted a bid to the IOC for the 2022 Winter Olympics, together with Zakopane, Poland, and Jasná, a village in central Slovakia, near the Polish border. If the bid had been successful, it would have been the first time either Poland or Slovakia hosted the Olympics. Zakopane previously bid to host the 2006 Winter Olympics but failed to become a candidate. Kraków's bid was submitted to a local referendum held on 25 May 2014, which had a negative result. After that Kraków discontinued the application on 26 May 2014.\nThe National Olympic Committee of Ukraine officially submitted a bid for Lviv to host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games on 5 November 2013. On 30 June 2014, however, the IOC announced that Lviv would \"turn its attention to an Olympic bid for 2026, and not continue with its application for 2022. The decision comes as a result of the 2013–15 Ukrainian crisis\" which seriously influences Lviv and the country.\nOn 11 November 2013, the Swedish Olympic Committee announced that it had submitted a bid, but on 17 January 2014, Stockholm dropped the bid due to lack of political support. Åre, about from Stockholm, was scheduled to host the alpine skiing events. Stockholm previously hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and hosted equestrian events of the 1956 Summer Olympics, but this was the first time the Swedish capital was bidding for the Winter Olympics. Also, it would have been the first city to host both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, but that honour went to Beijing.\n\nBeijing was selected as host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Winter Paralympics after beating Almaty by just four votes. Beijing received one more vote than the 43 needed for majority.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47263083", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47263083", "title": "Celsa (Roman city)", "text": "Celsa (Roman city)\n\nCelsa was an important pre-Roman and Roman city located near the modern town of Velilla de Ebro.\n\nRecent excavations have brought to light many rich private and public buildings which give a glimpse of its former grandeur.\n\nCelsa was originally an Iberian settlement, called \"Kelse\", of the Ilergetes tribe. It was located in the middle reaches of the River Ebro at a privileged position on the natural route from the coast to the peninsular. It was sited on terraces rising from the river and dominating a strategic ford.\n\nFrom the mid-second to the first half of the first century BC, Kelse coined its own currency with representations of winged victories, Hercules and Venus and this is the main documentation of the city.\nIt later had the only stone bridge over the upper Ebro located in Velilla de Ebro, where remains of a bridge were reported in the 19th c.\n\nMarcus Emilius Lepidus, governor of Hispania Citerior, founded a colony here in 44 BC with discharged veterans of the legions, who each received a plot of land to cultivate and the grant of Roman citizenship. It was known as \"Colonia Celsa Lepida\", the highest rank of Roman city and one of the only two colonies in Aragon with Caesaraugusta. The new town occupied an area of about 44 ha. and played a key role as communications centre via Tarraco (Tarragona). The population eventually numbered about 4,000.\n\nThe settlement was soon renamed \"Colonia Victrix Iulia Celsa\" because Lepidus was removed from political office and exiled in 36 BC by Augustus, Caesar's successor. Celsa experienced a period of great splendour, but it was brief and from the time of Nero it began to wane. The reason for its decline is likely to be due to economic and administrative changes resulting from the creation of a new and thriving colony in the area, Caesaraugusta, which monopolised the main trade flows.\n\nWhole neighbourhoods have been brought to light with paved streets and blocks of houses of several floors arranged around courtyards, in Roman fashion, and rooms decorated with mosaics and paintings are numerous. Commercial establishments such as warehouses, shops, a market and a bakery can be seen.\n\nRoman architects carefully designed the street plan around the terraced slopes so that the streets evacuated rainwater into the Ebro because, unlike other Roman cities, it had no drains. For this reason the main arteries of the city are parallel and perpendicular to the river.\n\nExcavations have also unearthed remains of several residential buildings of great interest, among which are the Houses of the Dolphin and of Hercules, both with beautiful and important wall paintings.\n\nThis latter house, of enormous dimensions, inaugurated the use of the Tuscan atrium in Celsa, one of the earliest types of italic-style house. Two stages can be seen in this house; the first (from the founding of the colony) centred around the Tuscan atrium and the second after the addition of the arcaded courtyard to the north, in the reign of Augustus. Rainwater collected in the impluvium of the atrium and was stored in a giant water tank located under room 29. The mosaic floors are of great beauty, especially in room 1 which also had walls adorned with paintings of the second Pompeian style, displaying several episodes of the labours of Hercules which gave its name to the house. The arcaded courtyard gave access to well-designed rooms for a peaceful and private life.\n\nThe House of the Dolphin is so named after the beautiful dolphins that decorate the mosaic floors. It was altered several times after combining the two houses that the initially occupied the \"insula\", or block, up to the time of Claudius in 54 AD. This great mansion took shape in the first decade of the 1st c. AD built around two spaces. The first part (rooms 1-14) corresponds to\nthe public area and private rooms of the family; the second (15-22) is organised around an open courtyard with various rooms dedicated to services and slaves.\n\nThe locations of possible temples, the theatre, the forum, major cisterns, springs, cemeteries and other public buildings have been identified. The theatre lies below the San José sanctuary where traces of the \"scaenae frons\" (stage) walls and tiers of seats (\"cavea\") have been found.\n\nMany small objects as lamps, Pompeian red slip dishes, Iberian ceramics, etc., as well as small bronzes, sculptural remains, coins and small pieces of jewellery are also preserved. A nearby museum displays many of the finds.\n\n"}

{"id": "6221709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6221709", "title": "Cold wave", "text": "Cold wave\n\nA cold wave (known in some regions as a cold snap or cold spell) is a weather phenomenon that is distinguished by a cooling of the air. Specifically, as used by the U.S. National Weather Service, a cold wave is a rapid fall in temperature within a 24-hour period requiring substantially increased protection to agriculture, industry, commerce, and social activities. The precise criterion for a cold wave is determined by the rate at which the temperature falls, and the minimum to which it falls. This minimum temperature is dependent on the geographical region and time of year.\n\nIn the United States, a \"cold spell\" is defined as the national average high temperature dropping below . A cold wave of sufficient magnitude and duration may be classified as a cold air outbreak (CAO).\n\nA cold wave can cause death and injury to livestock and wildlife. Exposure to cold mandates greater caloric intake for all animals, including humans, and if a cold wave is accompanied by heavy and persistent snow, grazing animals may be unable to reach needed food and die of hypothermia or starvation. They often necessitate the purchase of foodstuffs to feed livestock at considerable cost to farmers.\n\nCold spells are associated with increased mortality rates in populations around the world. Both cold waves and heat waves cause deaths, though different groups of people may be susceptible to different weather events. In developed countries, more deaths occur during a heat wave than in a cold snap, though the mortality rate is higher in undeveloped regions of the world. Globally, more people die during cold weather than hot weather, due to the rise in diseases like cold, flu, and pneumonia.\n\nExtreme winter cold often causes poorly insulated water pipelines and mains to freeze. Even some poorly protected indoor plumbing ruptures as water expands within them, causing much damage to property and costly insurance claims. Demand for electrical power and fuels rises dramatically during such times, even though the generation of electrical power may fail due to the freezing of water necessary for the generation of hydroelectricity. Some metals may become brittle at low temperatures. Motor vehicles may fail when antifreeze fails or motor oil gels, producing a failure of the transportation system. To be sure, such is more likely in places like Siberia and much of Canada that customarily get very cold weather.\n\nFires become even more of a hazard during extreme cold. Water mains may break and water supplies may become unreliable, making firefighting more difficult. The air during a cold wave is typically denser and thus contains more oxygen, so when air that a fire draws in becomes unusually cold it is likely to cause a more intense fire.\n\nWinter cold waves that aren't considered cold in some areas, but cause temperatures significantly below average for an area, are also destructive. Areas with subtropical climates may recognize unusual cold, perhaps barely freezing, temperatures, as a cold wave. In such places, plant and animal life is less tolerant of such cold as may appear rarely. The same winter temperatures that one associates with the norm for Colorado, Ohio, or Bavaria are catastrophic to winter crops in places like\nFlorida, California, or parts of South America that grow fruit and vegetables in winter.\n\nCold waves that bring unexpected freezes and frosts during the growing season in mid-latitude zones can kill plants during the early and most vulnerable stages of growth, resulting in crop failure as plants are killed before they can be harvested economically. Such cold waves have caused famines. At times as deadly to plants as drought, cold waves can leave a land in danger of later brush and forest fires that consume dead biomass. One extreme was the so-called Year Without a Summer of 1816, one of several years during the 1810s in which numerous crops failed during freakish summer cold snaps after volcanic eruptions that reduced incoming sunlight.\n\nIn some places, such as Siberia, extreme cold requires that fuel-powered machinery to be used even part-time must be run continuously. Internal plumbing can be wrapped, and persons can often run water continuously through pipes. Energy conservation, difficult as it is in a cold wave, may require such measures as collecting people (especially the poor and elderly) in communal shelters. Even the homeless may be arrested and taken to shelters, only to be released when the hazard abates. Hospitals can prepare for the admission of victims of frostbite and hypothermia; schools and other public buildings can be converted into shelters.\n\nPeople can stock up on food, water, and other necessities before a cold wave. Some may even choose to migrate to places of milder climates, at least during the winter. Suitable stocks of forage can be secured before cold waves for livestock, and livestock in vulnerable areas might be shipped from affected areas or even slaughtered. Smudge pots can bring smoke that prevents hard freezes on a farm or grove. Vulnerable crops may be sprayed with water that will paradoxically protect the plants by freezing and absorbing the cold from surrounding air.\n\nMost people can dress appropriately and can even layer their clothing should they need to go outside or should their heating fail. They can also stock candles, matches, flashlights, and portable fuel for cooking and wood for fireplaces or wood stoves, as necessary. However caution should be taken as the use of charcoal fires for cooking or heating within an enclosed dwelling is extremely dangerous due to carbon monoxide poisoning. Adults must remain aware of the exposure that children and the elderly have to cold.\n\n2018\n\n2017-2018\n\n2017\n\n2016\n\n2014-2015\n\n\n2013-2014\n\n\n2013\n\n\n2012\n\n2010-2011\n\n2009-2010\n\n\n\n2008\n\n2007\n\n2005-2006\n\n2004-2005\n\n1997\n\n1996\n\n1995\n\n1994\n\n1990–1991\n\n1989\n\n1987\n\n1985-1986\n\n1985\n1983\n\n1981-1982\n\n\n1979\n\n1978\n\n1977\n\n1977-1979 Winters\n\n1968-1969\n\n1966\n\n1962-1963\n\n1956\n\n1950\n\n1949\n\n1941-1942\n\n1937\n\n1935-1936\n\n1934\n\n1933\n\n1917-1918\n\n1916-1917\n\n1912\n\n1899\n\n1888\n\n1886-1887\n\n1882-1883\n\n1874-1875\n\n1859\n\n1857\n\n1835\n\n\n\n"}

This is especially true when an elderly person has several different conditions or diseases, but where it appears that none of them alone or together may clearly lead to the death, and it is uncertain which condition was the final factor causing death. For example, a person dying from complications from influenza (an infection), a heart attack (an internal body malfunction), or sudden heart failure would be listed as having died from natural causes. Health departments discourage listing old age as the cause of death because doing so does not benefit public health or medical research. Old age is not a scientifically recognized cause of death; there is always a more direct cause, although it may be unknown in certain cases and could be one of a number of aging-associated diseases.\n\nBy contrast, death caused by active intervention is called unnatural death. The \"unnatural\" causes are usually given as accident (implying no unreasonable voluntary risk), misadventure (an accident following a willful and dangerous risk, which can include drug or alcohol overdose), suicide, or homicide. In some settings, other categories may be added. For example, a prison may track the deaths of inmates caused by acute intoxication separately. Additionally, a cause of death can be recorded as \"undetermined\".\n\n\n\n"}

This can occur due to a change in product name or due to a software error.\n\nIn law, double billing refers to charging an hourly rate to two clients for the same time spent working. The American Bar Association prohibits double billing. It is tantamount to overcharging, since the amount of time actually spent working on any one client's work is less than the amount billed to that client.\n\nAssociates and partners alike at large law firms face significant pressure to double bill or to \"pad\" their hours in order to reduce overwork. These attorneys are usually required to bill 1800 to 2000 hours per year. This can ideally work out to a 40-hour work week, but it is usually 60 or more, since most attorneys must spend around two hours in the office for every one that they can bill to a specific client. In 1998, Cameron Stracher's book \"Double Billing\" suggested that double billing is common in law firms, but that implication was misleading. However, several recent studies suggest that at least 1/3 of lawyers admit that they double-bill clients on at least an occasional basis, and that more than half of lawyers do not believe that double billing constitutes an ethical violation.\n"}

Bryant had an unhappy childhood and his father was frequently imprisoned for debt. He lived with his uncle Bezabiel Bryant in Bedford, New York. He studied medicine under his uncle, Dr. Peter Bryant, father of the poet William Cullen Bryant. He may have attended Brown University. He founded the Providence, Rhode Island newspaper the \"Literary Cadet\" in 1826 and edited the \"New York Examiner\" in Rochester, New York.\nIn December 1830, Bryant joined George D. Prentice as co-editor of the \"Louisville Journal\" in Kentucky. Prentice, who had founded the newspaper only a month earlier, and Bryant penned blistering anti-Jacksonian editorials under the signatures \"P\" and \"B\". Following a trip to Frankfort, Kentucky to report on the Kentucky General Assembly, Bryant left the paper in May because it could not afford two editors. Bryant partnered with N.L. Finnell to edit the newly founded \"Lexington Observer\", which a year later purchased and merged with the \"Kentucky Reporter\" (founded in 1807) to become the pro-Whig Party \"Lexington Observer and Reporter\".\n\nBryant was hired to edit the \"Lexington Intelligencer\" in 1834 and spent the next decade at the newspaper, eventually becoming its owner before selling it to John C. Noble. Bryant penned frequent editorials, including editorials supporting the anti-Catholic nativism movement and a series of racist attacks on Vice President Richard Mentor Johnson for his black common law wife and two mixed race daughters. In 1844, at the urging of Whig politicians Henry Clay and John J. Crittenden, Bryant and Walter Newman Haldeman founded another pro-Whig newspaper, the \"Louisville Daily Dime\", which was soon renamed the \"Louisville Courier\".\n\nCiting poor health and the desire to write a book about the experience, in 1846 Bryant left the fledgling \"Courier\" and embarked on an expedition to California. Bryant and two others took a steamboat to Independence, Missouri, where they joined a large party gathered by General William Henry Russell (1802-1873), Kentucky lawyer and grandson of General William Russell, which included former Missouri Governor Lilburn Boggs and future Oregon legislator Jesse Quinn Thornton. The party began the journey to California in May. On the trail they were joined by a group of settlers who became the notorious Donner Party and attended the funeral of their first casualty, Sarah Keyes. Word of Bryant's limited medical experience had spread to other wagon trains and one enlisted him to help a ten-year-old boy with a crushed leg. Bryant helped a drover who had been a surgeon's assistant attempt an amputation with a handsaw, but the boy died during the primitive procedure.\n\nIn June, concerned about the slow pace of the wagon train, Bryant and a small group of others rode ahead on pack mules, leaving most of the other pioneers, including the Donner Party, behind. Bryant's group took the Hastings Cutoff, a shorter but much rougher path that took them through the Great Salt Lake Desert. Bryant was concerned that the wagon train was unsuited for such a passage and wrote letters to James Reed and other members of the Donner Party to warn them away from the cutoff. Jim Bridger had been heavily promoting the Cutoff to bring emigrants to Fort Bridger, which the main route bypassed, and Bryant left his letters in the care of Bridger and Louis Vasquez, founders of the trading post. When the Donner Party arrived there, they did not receive Bryant's warning and proceeded down the Cutoff, a decision that led to their being stranded in the mountains that winter.\n\nBryant arrived in San Francisco in September 1846 and soon involved himself in the affairs of Alta California. He volunteered to serve with Captain John C. Frémont and served as 1st Lieutenant of Company H under Robert T. Jacobs. The next year, General Stephen W. Kearny appointed Bryant the second alcalde of San Francisco, a post in which he served from February to June 1847. The post is a predecessor to that of Mayor of San Francisco, but it also had judicial functions as well, and later in life Bryant was sometimes referred to as Judge Bryant. One of Bryant's key acts was to arrange for the sale of 450 lots of publicly owned waterfront property to private buyers, and arranged to purchase fourteen lots for himself for $4000. Originally intending to return home by sea, he accompanied General Kearny's overland party bringing Frémont east to stand trial for his actions in California. Later in 1847 he testified at Frémont's court martial.\n\nIn 1848, D. Appleton & Company published \"What I Saw in California: Being the Journal of a Tour, by the Emigrant Route and South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, across the Continent of North America, the Great Desert Basin, and through California, in the Years 1846, 1847\", Bryant's account of his westward journey and his time in California. Coinciding with westward expansion and the California Gold Rush, Bryant's book became immensely popular and many emigrants and gold miners used Bryant's book as a guide. By 1850, there were seven editions printed in the United States, two in England, and one each in Sweden and France. In 1849, with much ceremony he led a company of 48 on a brisk return trip to California, where he sold the lots he had purchased for $100,000. He returned to Kentucky via Panama and New Orleans.\n\nWealthy thanks to real estate profits, book royalties, and lecture tours, Bryant settled in the literary colony of Pewee Valley, Kentucky. He built a large two-story house called Oaklea, which later appeared in the Little Colonel stories of Annie Fellows Johnston. There he lived out the American Civil War in safety.\n\nBryant made a final trip to California by railroad while in poor health in June 1869. In December, he was moved to the Willard Hotel in Louisville where he could be closer to medical assistance. There, he died after jumping out of a window. Bryant's service was performed at Christ Church Cathedral and his body spent the next twelve years in the public receiving vault of Cave Hill Cemetery, until it was finally buried. In 1888, a nephew and brother-in-law had the body exhumed and reburied in the Bryant family section of Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati.\n\nBryant Street in San Francisco is named for him.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "33238517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33238517", "title": "Gerolamo Induno", "text": "Gerolamo Induno\n\nGerolamo Induno (13 December 1825 – 18 December 1890) was an Italian painter and soldier, best known for his military scenes. His older brother, Domenico, was also a well-known artist and they often worked together.\n\nHe was born in Milan, where his father was a chef and butler at the Milanese court. He took his first formal art lessons at the Brera Academy, where he studied with Luigi Sabatelli from 1839 to 1846. His first exhibit was in 1845; composed of portraits and a scene from \"The Betrothed\" by Alessandro Manzoni (now lost).\n\nIn 1848, he and Domenico were participants in the Five Days of Milan and had to flee to avoid reprisals by the Austrian government. They spent two years in Ticino, then returned and settled in Florence. His brother went back to painting, but he enlisted in a volunteer regiment led by General Giacomo Medici and fought against the French during their siege of Rome. He also managed to produce numerous sketches of the war.\n\nWhile engaged in the defense of the , near Porta San Pancrazio, he was stabbed with several bayonets and seriously wounded while leading a charge. After a long recovery, he was able to return to Milan under the protection of Count Giulio Litta, a composer and avid art collector. Because of his injuries, he was exempt from being inducted into the Austrian army and went to work in his brother's studio. In the following years, he created many works based on the events of the Risorgimento, as well as genre works, influenced by his brother.\n\nFrom 1854 to 1855, during the Crimean War, he was back in uniform; this time with the Bersaglieri of Alessandro La Marmora. Once again, he made numerous sketches that were turned into paintings and lithographs. These included a depiction of the Battle of the Chernaya that was purchased by King Victor Emmanuel II. Some of his works were exhibited at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1859, despite lingering health issues, he enlisted in the Hunters of the Alps and came to be recognized by Garibaldi as the official painter of the Risorgimento, especially on matters of an official character. His genre scenes became almost entirely devoted to military themes.\n\nDuring the 1860s, in addition to his patriotic canvases, he created some large decorative works; including an allegory on Rome and Florence for the new Milano Centrale railway station (now demolished), and a curtain depicting the \" of Naples\" for the theater in Gallarate. In 1861, he received a gold medal at an exhibition in Florence for his painting of the Battle of Magenta, but gave it up in solidarity with the painters who had been overlooked.\n\nAfter unification had been achieved, his genre works tended to focus on scenes from the seventeenth century and he began to exhibit paintings on a wider variety of topics outside Italy, including Vienna (1873), Paris (1878), Antwerp (1885) and London (1888). His best-known work from this period is \"A Game of Chess\", a scene from a play of the same name by Giuseppe Giacosa. He died in Milan in 1890, after a long illness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4348686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4348686", "title": "Golden State Killer", "text": "Golden State Killer\n\nThe Golden State Killer is a serial killer, rapist, and burglar who committed at least 13 murders, more than 50 rapes, and over 100 burglaries in California from 1974 to 1986. He is believed to be responsible for three crime sprees throughout California, each of which spawned a different nickname in the press before it became evident that they were committed by the same person.\n\nIn the Sacramento area he was known as the East Area Rapist, and was linked by \"modus operandi\" (MO) to additional attacks in Contra Costa County, Stockton, and Modesto. He was later known for his southern California crimes as the Original Night Stalker. His rape victims were women and girls aged between 13 and 41. He is suspected to have begun as a burglar (the Visalia Ransacker) before moving to the Sacramento area, based on a similar MO and circumstantial evidence.\n\nDuring the investigation, several suspects have been cleared through DNA evidence, alibi, or other investigative methods. In 2001, DNA testing indicated that the East Area Rapist and the Original Night Stalker were the same person and he was known as the EAR/ONS. The FBI and local law-enforcement agencies held a news conference on June 15, 2016 to announce a renewed nationwide effort, offering a reward for his capture. The case was a factor in the establishment of California's DNA database, which collects DNA from all accused and convicted felons in California and has been called second only to Virginia's in effectiveness in solving cold cases. To heighten awareness that the uncaught killer operated throughout California, crime writer Michelle McNamara called him the Golden State Killer.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, authorities charged 72-year-old U.S. Navy veteran and former police officer Joseph James DeAngelo with eight counts of first-degree murder, based upon DNA evidence. This was also the first announcement connecting the Visalia Ransacker crimes to the Golden State Killer. Due to California's statute of limitations on pre-2017 rape cases, DeAngelo cannot be charged with late-1970s rapes, but he was charged in August 2018 with 13 related kidnapping/abduction attempts. \n\nDNA evidence links the Golden State Killer to eight murders in Goleta, Ventura, Dana Point and Irvine; two other murders in Goleta, lacking DNA evidence, are linked by \"modus operandi (\"MO). Investigators suspect the same killer in three other murders: two in Rancho Cordova and one in Visalia. The offender also committed more than 50 known rapes in the California counties of Sacramento, Contra Costa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin, Alameda, Santa Clara and Yolo, in addition to hundreds of incidents of burglaries, peeping, stalking and prowling.\n\nIt was long suspected that the training ground of the criminal who would become the Golden State Killer was Visalia, California (although the earlier crimes sprees of the 'Cordova Catburgler' or the 'Exeter Ransacker' are now suspected to be linked as well). From April 1974 to December 1975, the Visalia Ransacker is believed to have been responsible for one murder and around 120 burglaries. Most of the Ransacker's activities involved breaking into houses, rifling through (or vandalizing) the owner's possessions, scattering women's underclothing, stealing coins and low-value or personal items, while often ignoring banknotes and other valuable items in plain sight.\n\nIn late April 2018, the Visalia chief of police stated that while there is no DNA linking DeAngelo to the Central Valley cases, his department has other evidence that will play a role in the investigation, and that he was \"confident that the Visalia Ransacker has been captured.\" Though the statute of limitations for the burglaries have expired, DeAngelo was formally charged on August 13, 2018 with the 1st degree murder of Claude Snelling in 1975.\n\nThe Golden State Killer is believed to have moved to the Sacramento area, progressing from burglary to rape in mid-1976. The crimes initially centered on the unincorporated areas of Carmichael, Citrus Heights and Rancho Cordova, east of Sacramento. His initial \"modus operandi\" was to stalk middle-class neighborhoods at night in search of women who were alone in one-story homes, usually near a school, creek, trail or other open space that would provide a quick escape. He was seen a number of times, but always successfully fled; on one occasion, he shot and seriously wounded a young pursuer.\nMost victims had seen (or heard) a prowler on their property before the attacks, and many had experienced break-ins. Police believed that the offender had a pattern of conducting extensive reconnaissance on several homes in a targeted neighborhood before selecting one for attack. As part of his surveillance, he was known to look in the windows of future victims and prowl in the yards of homes for several nights before attacking. On a few occasions, it is believed that in the run-up to attacks the offender entered the homes of future victims to unlock windows, unload guns and plant ligatures for later use. He frequently called them before the attack, sometimes for months in advance, to learn their daily routines; he would sometimes hang up, pretend to have the wrong number, or (in calls after the attack) threaten to harm the victims again.\n\nAlthough he originally targeted women alone in their homes or with children, the offender eventually preferred attacking couples. His MO was to break in through a window or sliding glass door and awaken the sleeping occupants with a flashlight, threatening them with a handgun. Victims were then bound with ligatures (often shoelaces) which he found or brought with him, blindfolded and gagged with towels which he had ripped into strips. The female victim was usually forced to tie up her male companion before she was bound. The bindings were often so tight that the victims' hands were numb for hours after being untied. He then separated the couple, often stacking dishes on the man's back and threatening to kill everyone in the house if he heard them rattle. He moved the woman to the living room and often raped her repeatedly, sometimes for several hours.\nThe offender sometimes spent hours in the home ransacking closets and drawers, eating food in the kitchen, drinking beer, raping the female again or making additional threats. Victims sometimes thought he had left the house before he \"jump[ed] from the darkness.\" The offender typically stole items, often personal objects and items of little value but occasionally cash and firearms. He then crept away, leaving victims uncertain if he had left. The offender was believed to escape on foot through a series of yards and then use a bicycle to go home or to a car, making extensive use of parks, schoolyards, creek beds and other open spaces which kept him off the street.\n\nThe rapist operated in Sacramento County from the first attacks in June 1976 until May 1977. After a three-month gap, he struck in nearby San Joaquin County in September before returning to Sacramento for all but one of the next ten attacks. The rapist attacked five times during the summer of 1978 in Stanislaus and Yolo counties before disappearing again for three months. Attacks then moved primarily to Contra Costa County in October and lasted until July 1979.\nA young Sacramento couple, Brian and Katie Maggiore (the former, a military policeman at Mather Air Force Base), were walking their dog in the Rancho Cordova area on the night of February 2, 1978, near where five East Area Rapist attacks had occurred. The Maggiores fled after a confrontation in the street, but were chased down and shot dead. Some investigators suspected that they had been murdered by the East Area Rapist because of their proximity to the other attacks' location, and a shoelace was found nearby. The FBI announced on June 15, 2016, that it was confident that the East Area Rapist murdered the Maggiores.\n\nShortly after a rape committed on July 5, the East Area Rapist moved to southern California and first struck in Santa Barbara County in October. The attacks lasted until 1981 (with a lone 1986 attack), and took a darker turn as the rapist began to kill his victims. Only the couple in the first attack survived, alerting neighbors and forcing the intruder to flee; the other victims were murdered by gunshot or bludgeoning. Since the East Area Rapist was not linked to these crimes for decades, he was known as the Night Stalker in the area before being renamed the Original Night Stalker after Richard Ramirez received the former nickname.\n\nOn October 1, an intruder broke in and tied up a Goleta couple. Alarmed by hearing him say, \"I'll kill 'em\" to himself, the man and woman tried to escape when he left the room and the woman screamed. Realizing that the alarm had been raised, the intruder fled on a bicycle. A neighbor (an FBI agent) responded to the noise and pursued the perpetrator, who abandoned the bicycle and a knife and fled on foot through local backyards. The attack was later linked to the Offerman–Manning murders by shoe prints and twine used to bind the victims.\n\nOn December 30, 44-year-old Robert Offerman and 35-year-old Debra Alexandra Manning were found shot dead at Offerman's condominium on Avenida Pequena in Goleta. Offerman's bindings were untied, indicating that he had lunged at the attacker. Neighbors heard gunshots but failed to respond, saying that they thought the shots were innocuous. Paw prints of a large dog were found at the scene, leading to speculation that the killer may have brought one with him. The killer also broke into the vacant adjoining residence and stole a bicycle, later found abandoned on a street north of the scene, from a third residence in the complex.\n\nOn March 13, 33-year-old Charlene Smith and 43-year-old Lyman Smith (who was about to be appointed as a judge) were found murdered in their Ventura home; Charlene Smith had been raped. A log from a woodpile on the side of the house was used to bludgeon the victims to death. Their wrists and ankles had been bound with drapery cord. An unusual Chinese knot, a diamond knot, was used on Charlene's wrists; the same knot was noted in the Sacramento East Area Rapist attacks, at least one confirmed case of which was publicly known. The murderer was therefore given the name \"Diamond Knot Killer\".\n\nOn August 19, 24-year-old Keith Eli Harrington and 27-year-old Patrice Briscoe Harrington were found bludgeoned to death in their home on Cockleshell Drive in Dana Point's Niguel Shores gated community. Patrice Harrington had also been raped. Although there was evidence that the Harringtons' wrists and ankles were bound, no ligatures or murder weapon were found at the scene. The Harringtons had been married for three months at the time of their deaths. Patrice was a nurse in Irvine, and Keith was a medical student at UC Irvine. Keith's brother Bruce later spent nearly $2 million supporting California Proposition 69 authorizing DNA collection from all California felons and certain other criminals.\n\nOn February 6, 28-year-old Manuela Witthuhn was raped and murdered in her Irvine home. Although Witthuhn's body had signs of being tied before she was bludgeoned, no ligatures or murder weapon were found. The victim was married; her husband was hospitalized, and she was alone at the time of the attack. Detectives noted that Witthuhn's television was found in the backyard, possibly the killer's attempt to make the crime appear to be a botched robbery.\n\nOn July 27, 35-year-old Cheri Domingo and 27-year-old Gregory Sanchez were the Original Night Stalker's 10th and 11th murder victims. Both were attacked in Domingo's residence on Toltec Way in Goleta (several blocks south of Robert Offerman's condominium), where she was living temporarily; it was owned by a deceased relative and up for sale. The offender entered the house through a small bathroom window. Sanchez had not been tied, and was shot and wounded in the cheek before he was bludgeoned to death with a garden tool. Some believe that Sanchez may have realized he was dealing with the man responsible for the Offerman–Manning murders, and tried to tackle the killer rather than be tied up. Again, no neighbors responded to the gunshot. Sanchez's head was covered with clothes pulled from the closet. Domingo was raped and bludgeoned; bruises on her wrists and ankles indicated that she had been tied, although the restraints were missing. A piece of shipping twine was found near the bed, and fibers from an unknown source were scattered over her body. Authorities believed that the attacker may have worked as a painter or in a similar job at the Calle Real Shopping Centre.\n\nOn May 4, 18-year-old Janelle Lisa Cruz was found after she was raped and bludgeoned to death in her Irvine home. Her family was on vacation in Mexico at the time of the attack. A pipe wrench, reported missing by Cruz's stepfather, was thought to be the murder weapon.\n\nThe southern California murders were not initially thought to be connected by investigators in their respective jurisdictions. A Sacramento detective strongly believed that the East Area Rapist was responsible for the Goleta attacks, but the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department attributed them to a local career criminal who was later murdered. Investigating the crimes not committed in Goleta caused local police to follow false leads related to men who were close to the female victims. One person, later cleared, was charged with two murders. The cases were linked almost entirely by DNA testing, many years later.\n\nThese physical characteristics are considered factual based on crime-scene evidence and nearly-universal agreement by victims and law enforcement:\n\nThese physical characteristics are considered probable; a small percentage of victims described the perpetrator differently:\n\nAccording to the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department, microscopic paint chips were found at three crime scenes (two homicides and a rape). This suggests that the Golden State Killer may have worked in construction, possibly using a paint spray gun. Construction work had been ongoing near the 1979 Goleta murder scene, and a cold-case investigator contacted the developer in 2013 to identify subcontractors working at the site and obtain employment records.\n\nAfter criminologists matched serological evidence found at the southern California murder scenes, a speculative psychological profile of the Golden State Killer was compiled based on a probabilistic analysis. According to Leslie D'Ambrosia, primary author of the profile, the Golden State Killer probably had the following characteristics:\n\nIn addition to outlining the Golden State Killer's characteristics, the profile speculates that he might have been incarcerated after Janelle Cruz's murder or killed in the commission of a similar crime; however, the latter is unlikely since he contacted victims as late as 2001. Regardless, the profile recommends that law-enforcement agencies investigate attempted late-1980s hot prowl burglaries which resulted in the death of a lone male offender. It indicates a slight chance that the Golden State Killer committed suicide; he is unlikely to be confined in a mental institution.\n\nAccording to the profile, teleprinter bulletins were broadcast to law-enforcement agencies throughout the United States after the original homicides. The bulletins requested information on similar home invasions involving sexual assault, murder, bludgeoning, multiple victims, and bondage. , no similar crimes have been reported. The profile posits that the Golden State Killer could have continued committing his crimes in another country whose records were not linked.\n\nIn December 1977, letters containing a poem entitled \"Excitement's Crave\" by an individual claiming to be the East Area Rapist were sent to the editor of the \"Sacramento Bee\", the Sacramento mayor's office, and the KVIE TV station. December 11 is the date that a masked man (probably the Golden State Killer) eluded pursuit by law-enforcement personnel after alerting authorities by telephone that he would strike on Watt Avenue that night. Although the authenticity of the poem has never been proven, his evasion of the police that morning may have inspired him to write it.\n\nDuring the investigation of the 42nd attack in Danville, investigators discovered three notebook leaves near the scene where a suspicious vehicle had reportedly been parked, although whether they originated from the East Area Rapist has not been proven. The first leaf appears to be an essay on General George Armstrong Custer. The second contains a journal-style entry where the author writes about a teacher who made his or her students write lines, which the author found humiliating:\n\nThe last is a hand-drawn map of what appears to be a suburban neighborhood, with the word \"punishment\" scrawled across the reverse side of the paper. Investigators were unable to identify the area depicted in the map, although the artist clearly had knowledge of architectural layout and landscape design. According to Detective Larry Pool, the map is a fantasy location representing the Golden State Killer's desired striking ground.\n\nOn March 18, 1977, the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office received three calls from a man claiming to be the East Area Rapist; none were recorded. The first two calls, received at 4:15 and 4:30 p.m., were identical and ended with the caller laughing and hanging up. The final call came in at 5:00 p.m., with the caller saying: \"I'm the East Side Rapist and I have my next victim already stalked and you guys can't catch me.\"\n\nA man claiming to be the rapist called the Sacramento Police, saying: \"You're never gonna catch me, East Area Rapist, you dumb fuckers, I'm gonna fuck again tonight. Careful!\" The call was recorded and later released. Similarly to the previous call, the East Area Rapist attacked his next victim the same night.\n\nA previous victim received a phone call during the 1977 Christmas season which she attributed to her attacker. The caller said, \"Merry Christmas, it's me again!\"\n\nShortly before 10:00 p.m. on the night of December 10, 1977, dispatchers from the County of Sacramento's Sheriff's Department and the City of Sacramento's Police Department received identical calls saying: \"I am going to hit tonight. Watt Avenue.\" Both were reportedly recorded, and the caller was identified as the same person who placed the December 2 call. Law-enforcement patrols were increased that night in response, and at 2:30 a.m. sheriff's deputies spotted a masked man bicycling on the Watt Avenue bridge; he eluded them. He was located again at 4:30 a.m. by city police. He discarded the bike, which was determined to have been stolen in Redding, California, and fled on foot.\n\nThe first known rape victim received a wrong-number call asking for \"Ray\" on January 2, 1978. The call was recorded, and police suspect that it may be the same caller who made a threatening call to her later that evening. That call was also recorded and identified by the victim as the voice of her assailant. The caller said, \"Gonna kill you ... gonna kill you ... gonna kill you ... bitch ... bitch ... bitch ... bitch ... fuckin' whore.\"\n\nA volunteer for the Contact Counseling Service answered a call from a man claiming to be the East Area Rapist, who said: \"I have a problem. I need help because I don't want to do this anymore.\" After a short conversation the caller said, \"I believe you are tracing this call\" and hung up.\n\nIn 1982, a previous victim who was working at a Denny's restaurant received a call at work from the rapist during which he said that he would rape her again. According to Contra Costa County District Attorney Paul Holes, the rapist must have gone to the restaurant and recognized one of his victims working there.\n\nIn 1991, a previous victim received a phone call from the perpetrator and spoke with him for one minute. She could hear a woman and children in the background, leading to speculation that he had a family.\n\nOn April 6, 2001, the day after an article was published in the \"Sacramento Bee\" confirming that the Original Night Stalker and the East Area Rapist were the same person, a victim of the rapist received a call from him; he asked, \"Remember when we played?\" before hanging up.\n\nBefore officially connecting the Original Night Stalker to the East Area Rapist in 2001, some law-enforcement officials (particularly from the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department) sought to link the Goleta cases as well. The links were primarily due to similarities in \"modus operandi\". One of the already-linked Original Night Stalker double murders occurred in Ventura, southeast of Goleta, and the remaining murders were committed in Orange County—an additional southeast. In 2001, several rapes in Contra Costa County believed to have been committed by the East Area Rapist were linked by DNA to the Smith, Harrington, Whithuhn, and Cruz murders. A decade later, DNA evidence indicated that the Domingo–Sanchez murders were committed by the Golden State Killer.\n\nOn June 15, 2016, the FBI released further information related to the crimes, including new composite sketches and testimony from victims and local and federal investigators. A press conference was held in Sacramento, where local law-enforcement agencies and the FBI announced a reward for information leading to the conviction of the Golden State Killer. The initiative included a national database to support law enforcement investigating the crimes and handle tips and information.\n\nDuring the investigation, several people were considered and eliminated as suspects:\n\nIn November 2002, journalist Colleen Cason wrote a newspaper series about the murders for the \"Ventura County Star\". According to Cason, Detective Larry Pool of the Orange County Sheriff's Department visited California's Death Row at San Quentin in an attempt to locate the Golden State Killer; Pool suspected that the killer had been captured and sentenced to death for another violent crime. However, no genetic samples collected from Death Row inmates matched the DNA of the Golden State Killer.\n\nOn April 24, 2018, the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department arrested 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo in connection with the crimes. DeAngelo, a former police officer in Auburn and Exeter, California, was charged with eight counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances. On May 10, the Santa Barbara County District Attorney's office charged DeAngelo with four additional counts of first-degree murder.\n\nIdentification of DeAngelo had begun four months earlier when officials uploaded the killer's DNA profile from a Ventura County rape kit to the personal genomics website GEDmatch. The website identified 10 to 20 distant relatives of the Golden State Killer (sharing the same great-great-great grandparents), from whom a team of five investigators working with genealogist Barbara Rae-Venter constructed a large family tree. They identified two suspects in the case (one of whom was ruled out by a relative's DNA test), leaving DeAngelo the main suspect. On April 18, a DNA sample was surreptitiously collected from the door handle of a car DeAngelo had been driving at the Roseville Hobby Lobby. Soon after, a sample was collected from a tissue found in DeAngelo's curbside garbage can. Both samples were consistent with the Orange and Ventura County suspect profiles. After DeAngelo's arrest, some commentators raised concerns about the ethics of the secondary use of personally identifiable information.\n\nDeAngelo was born on November 8, 1945 in Bath, New York, to Joseph James DeAngelo Sr. and Kathleen Louise DeGroat, and he has two sisters: Rebecca and Connie and one brother: John. When he was 9–10 years old he saw Connie get raped. He attended ninth grade at Mills Middle School in Rancho Cordova, California. He graduated from Folsom High School in June 1964. DeAngelo joined the U.S. Navy in September that year, and served for 22-months during the Vietnam War as a damage controlman on the cruiser USS \"Canberra\", and received National Defense Service, Vietnam Service and Vietnam Campaign Medals.\n\nFrom August 1968, DeAngelo attended Sierra College, graduating with an associate degree in police science with honors in June 1970. He was engaged to Bonnie Colwell in May 1970; they were classmates at Sierra College, but they never married. Colwell purportedly called off the marriage. Investigators believe this might be connected to the offender reportedly saying, \"I hate you, Bonnie!\" during at least one of the attacks.\n\nIn 1971, he attended Sacramento State University, where he focused on criminal law and received a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. He then went on to do post-graduate work, before undergoing training (Kings County Public Safety Academy) at the College of the Sequoias in Visalia, and completing a 32-week police internship at Roseville Police Department.\n\nHe was then a police officer in Exeter (a town of about 10,000 people near Visalia, having relocated from Citrus Heights) from May 18, 1973 to August 1976. He married Sharon Marie Huddle on November 19, 1973. Huddle went to college in Fresno, California. Afterwards, she attended law school in Sacramento, California. She became an attorney in December 1982. They had three daughters and separated in 1991.\n\nBy 1976 he had been promoted to sergeant and was in charge of the Exeter Police Department's \"Joint Attack on Burglary\" program. He then served in Auburn (part of Greater Sacramento) from August 1976 to July 1979, when he was caught shoplifting a hammer and dog repellent and was sentenced to six months probation in October that year.\n\nHis employment history for the next decade is unknown. From 1990 until his retirement in 2017, DeAngelo was a truck mechanic at the Roseville distribution center for Save Mart Supermarkets. DeAngelo was living in Citrus Heights with a daughter and granddaughter at the time of his arrest. His brother-in-law, James Huddle, said that DeAngelo casually brought up the East Area Rapist in conversation around the time of the original crimes. Neighbors reported that DeAngelo frequently engaged in loud, profane outbursts.\n\nDeAngelo cannot be charged with rapes due to the statue of limitations expiring for those offenses, but he has been charged with 13 counts of murder and also is being charged with 13 counts of kidnapping. DeAngelo returned to court on July 12, 2018. Appearing again before Judge Michael Sweet, DeAngelo was shackled inside the courtroom holding area throughout the duration of the proceedings. Later, on August 13, 2018, Tulare County Sheriff's Office held a press conference to announce that they will be charging DeAngelo for the September 11, 1975 murder of Claude Snelling in Visalia.\n\nOn August 21, 2018 at 11:00 AM, a coalition of district attorneys appeared together to issue statements to the press. Presenting together were Contra Costa County DA, Diana Becton, Orange County DA, Tony Rackauckas, Sacramento County DA, Anne Marie Schubert, Santa Barbara County DA, Joyce E. Dudley, Tulare County DA, Tim Ward, Ventura County DA, Gregory D. Totten, and Lisa Bartlett, Supervisor of the 5th District (where the Orange County murders took place). This group of officials is in charge of prosecuting the case against DeAngelo, the alleged Golden State Killer. He was arraigned in Sacramento on August 23, 2018. Several DAs involved in the case were present in the courtroom, and members of the public were allowed to attend. In the gallery were several survivors, family members, and witnesses who will be participating in the upcoming series of preliminary hearings, many of whom gave interviews to the media at the conclusion of court business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

With more than 70 entrants and 130,000 spectators, it is the most well-attended single-day hot air balloon race in the United States.\n\nThe first race was launched by Nikki Caplan and John O'Toole in December 1973 at a gathering of six balloons and twenty spectators. In 1977, organization of the race passed from Caplan and O'Toole to a group of four novice balloonists who continue to coordinate the event today. These men are John Marlow, John Schaumburg, Ted Staley, and Dan Schettler, who formed a ballooning group known as the Mississippi River Balloon Transit Company. This company now is the host of the largest and most well attended balloon race. On May 23, 2000, the race was honored by the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress as a local legacy after a nomination by then-Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives Dick Gephardt. So now, the Great Forest Park Balloon Race is forever documented through photographs, advertisements, media, and pilot rewards.\n\nOn the day before the race, the hot air balloons participate in the Balloon Glow, a night glow opportunity for spectators to walk among inflated balloons illuminated by their burners. In addition to the Balloon Glow and a fireworks show, during the week of the event, a free public orchestral concert by the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra is held on nearby Art Hill, adjacent to the Saint Louis Art Museum. During the race, the balloonists attempt to \"chase\" a 166-foot balloon of a pink bunny after taking off from the Central Fields in Forest Park. The goal is to follow the bunny until it lands, and then each pilot drops a sandbag or birdseed bag as close as possible to the bunny balloon. The winner is decided based on which pilots's sandbag, or birdseed bag, is the closest to the bunny. Due to its urban location in the city of St. Louis, the race is considered \"particularly prestigious and challenging\", and participation is by invitation only. At times, landing sites have included backyards, baseball diamonds, golf courses, street intersections, and the convent grounds of the School Sisters of Notre Dame. The balloon race is accompanied by a festival that includes food and drink, inflatable castles, and a climbing wall.\n\n"}
{"id": "923791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=923791", "title": "Great Storm of 1987", "text": "Great Storm of 1987\n\nThe Great Storm of 1987 was a violent extratropical cyclone that occurred on the night of 15–16 October, with hurricane-force winds causing casualties in England, France and the Channel Islands as a severe depression in the Bay of Biscay moved northeast. Among the most damaged areas were Greater London, the East Anglian coast, the Home Counties, the west of Brittany and the Cotentin Peninsula of Normandy which weathered gusts typically with a return period of 1 in 200 years.\n\nForests, parks, roads and railways were strewn with fallen trees as well as schools being closed. The British National Grid suffered heavy damage, leaving thousands without power. At least 22 people were killed in England and France. The highest measured gust of was recorded at Pointe Du Roc, Granville, France and the highest gust in the UK of was recorded at Shoreham-by-Sea.\n\nThat day's weather reports had failed to indicate a storm of such severity, an earlier, correct forecast having been negated by later projections. The apparent suggestion by the BBC's Michael Fish of a false alarm is celebrated as a classic gaffe, though he claims he was misquoted. The storm has been termed a weather bomb due to its rapid development. \n\nMajor improvements were later implemented in atmospheric observation, relevant computer models, and the training of forecasters.\n\nOn the Sunday before the storm struck, the farmers' forecast had predicted bad weather on the following Thursday or Friday, 15–16 October. By midweek, however, guidance from weather prediction models was somewhat equivocal. Instead of stormy weather over a considerable part of the UK, the models suggested that severe weather would reach no farther north than the English Channel and coastal parts of southern England.\n\nDuring the afternoon of 15 October, winds were very light over most parts of the UK. The pressure gradient was slack. A depression was drifting slowly northwards over the North Sea off eastern Scotland. A trough lay over England, Wales and Ireland. Over the Bay of Biscay, a depression was developing.\n\nThe first gale warnings for sea areas in the English Channel were issued at 0630 UTC on 15 October and were followed, four hours later, by warnings of severe gales.\nAt 1200 UTC on 15 October, the depression which originated in the Bay of Biscay was centred near 46° N, 9° W and its depth was 970 mb. By 1800 UTC, it had moved north-east to about 47° N, 6° W, and deepened to 964 mb.\n\nAt 2235 UTC, winds of Force 10 were forecast. By midnight, the depression was over the western English Channel, and its central pressure was 953 mb. At 0140 on 16 October, warnings of Force 11 were issued. The depression now moved rapidly north-east, filling a little as it did, reaching the Humber Estuary at about 0530 UTC, by which time its central pressure was 959 mb. Dramatic increases in temperature were associated with the passage of the storm's warm front.\n\nIn the sea areas, warnings of severe weather were both timely and adequate, although forecasts for land areas left much to be desired.\nDuring the evening of 15 October, radio and TV forecasts mentioned strong winds, but indicated that heavy rain would be the main feature, rather than wind. By the time most people went to bed, exceptionally strong winds had not been mentioned in national radio and TV weather broadcasts.\n\nWarnings of severe weather had been issued, however, to various agencies and emergency authorities, including the London Fire Brigade. Perhaps the most important warning was issued by the Met Office to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) at 0135 UTC, 16 October. It warned that the anticipated consequences of the storm were such that civil authorities might need to call on assistance from the military.\n\nA highest gust of is estimated from satellite data at Quimper, Brittany, with the highest measured gust at at Pointe du Roc, Granville Normandy.\n\nIn south-east England, where the greatest damage occurred, gusts of or more were recorded continually for three or four consecutive hours.\nDuring this time, the wind veered from southerly to south-westerly. To the north-west of this region, there were two maxima in gust speeds, separated by a period of lower wind speeds. During the first period, the wind direction was southerly. During the latter, it was south-westerly. Damage patterns in south-east England suggested that tornadoes accompanied the storm.\n\nIn the UK, winds at Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex reached before the anemometer failed. Many anemometers were reliant on mains power, and ceased recording as the south east of the United Kingdom was blacked-out by power cuts, thus losing much valuable data.\nWinds with an estimated 200-year return period hit the counties of Kent, Sussex, Hampshire and along the coastal strip of Essex, Suffolk and South Eastern Norfolk. North of a line from Portland Bill, Dorset to Cromer, Norfolk the return period of the respective gusts were under 10 years.\n\nSustained winds speeds greater than 75 mph were recorded for over an hour in southern Britain. According to the Beaufort scale of wind intensities, this storm had winds of hurricane force 12 (73 mph or greater); as the term \"hurricane\" refers to tropical cyclones originating in the North Atlantic or North Pacific, the descriptor \"great storm\" has tended to be reserved for those storms in recent years reaching this velocity. Hurricanes have a very different wind profile and distribution from storms, and significantly higher precipitation levels.\n\nThe storm made landfall in Cornwall, and tracked north-east towards Devon and then over the Midlands, going out to sea via The Wash. The strongest gusts, of up to , were recorded along the south-eastern edge of the storm, hitting mainly Hampshire, Sussex, Essex and Kent. The Royal Sovereign lighthouse off Eastbourne recorded wind speeds on its instruments at the highest velocity it could measure, .\n\nThe storm caused substantial damage over much of England, felling an estimated 15 million trees (including six of the seven eponymous oaks in Sevenoaks, historic specimens in Kew Gardens, Wakehurst Place, Nymans Garden, Hyde Park, London and Scotney Castle and most of the trees making up Chanctonbury Ring). At Bedgebury National Pinetum, Kent almost a quarter of the trees were brought down. There have been many claims that the damage to forestry was made worse by broadleaf trees still being in leaf at the time of the storm, though this was not borne out by an analysis by the Forestry Commission.\n\nFallen trees blocked roads and railways and left widespread structural damage primarily to windows and roofs. Several hundred thousand people were left without power, not fully restored until more than two weeks later. Local electric utility officials later said they lost more wires in the storm than in the preceding decade. At sea, as well as many small boats being wrecked, a Sealink cross-channel ferry, the MV \"Hengist\", was driven ashore at Folkestone and the bulk carrier MV \"Sumnea\" capsized at Dover, Kent.\n\nThe National Grid sustained heavy damage during the event, as crashing cables short-circuited, which in some cases overheated the main system. Its headquarters faced the choice of keeping the Grid online to help London as the storm approached but risk an incremental system breakdown, failure and burnout, or to shut down most of South East England including London and avert that risk. The headquarters made the decision, the first one like it since before World War II: to shut down the South East power systems to maintain the network as soon as signs of overheating began.\n\nIn London, many of the trees lining streets, particularly plane trees, were blown down overnight, blocking roads and crushing parked cars. Building construction scaffolding and billboards collapsed in many places, and many buildings were damaged. The following morning, the BBC's largest broadcasting site, Lime Grove Studios in White City, was unable to function due to a power failure — ITV's TV-am and BBC1's \"Breakfast Time\" programmes were broadcast from different emergency facilities in emergency formats. TV-am broadcast from Thames Television's Euston Road studios, while BBC newsreader Nicholas Witchell had to broadcast from the BBC1 continuity studio at BBC Television Centre, with the wall decorations used for Children's BBC hastily taken down. Much of the public transport in the capital was not functioning, and people were advised against trying to go to work. TV-am host Anne Diamond did go back to the regular TV-am studio with reporter Kay Burley, whilst Richard Keys remained in the Thames Television studio in case the power supply situation became even worse, and indeed, power did go back down at around 8:15am.\n\nThe départements of Finistère, Morbihan, Côtes-d'Armor and Ille-et-Vilaine in Brittany, and the Cotentin Peninsula (Manche and part of Calvados) in Normandy were the areas in France most affected by the storm, which followed a line from Morbihan and Rennes to Deauville. 1.79 million homes were left without electricity supply and water, and a quarter of Brittany's forest was destroyed. The total damage was estimated at ₣23 billion.\n\nMétéo France announced \"\" (a little storm coming in from the Azores), which reached Brittany's coast at about 18:00, later than expected. This depression caused little damage, with only winds. A much deeper depression hit Ushant on the extreme western tip of Brittany at midnight. It was measured at 948 hPa (or 948 mb) at the Brest-Guipavas weather station, the lowest reading in its records dating back to 1945.\n\nWeather stations on the coast at pointe du Raz, pointe Saint-Mathieu and Penmarch gave no readings, as they were damaged by the high winds. The wind speed measured at Brest was . The centre of the storm crossed Brittany from Penmarch to Saint-Brieuc at , with gusts of wind up to at Quimper, at Ouessant and at la pointe de Penmarch and Granville. Waves were measured at off Ushant and Belle Île.\n\nSimilar strength storms in France since 1960: \n\nThe church at Concarneau was damaged but never rebuilt, and was finally demolished a few years later.\n\nThe MS \"Herald of Free Enterprise\" was caught in the storm off Cape Finisterre as it was making its way for scrapping in Taiwan. The ship was cast adrift after its tow rope parted, finally resuming its journey on 19 October 1987.\n\nThe storm cost the insurance industry £2 billion, making it the second most expensive UK weather event on record to insurers after the Burns' Day Storm of 1990. Peak wind velocities were in the early hours of the morning, which may have helped reduce the death toll. \nThe storm hit the Isle of Wight at 02:00. Shanklin Pier on the south-east coast of the island was broken into three pieces as a result of mountainous waves. Plans to rebuild the pier were soon abandoned, and the rest of the pier was demolished by contractors shortly afterwards. A monument now stands in front of what used to be the pier entrance.\n\nA great deal of effort and money was put into the post-storm clean-up of forests and wooded areas. The writer Oliver Rackham and the charity Common Ground were active in trying to prevent unnecessary destruction of trees which, although fallen, were still living. Some landowners, such as the National Trust, did not attempt complete clearing and replanting, realising that there was a unique opportunity to study the patterns of natural regeneration after such an event.\n\nA number of wild boar may have escaped from captivity during the storm, after enclosures were damaged by falling trees. These boar have since bred and established populations in woods across southern England.\n\nA more positive aspect could be found among some British gardeners; as Heather Angel wrote in the Royal Horticultural Society's \"Journal\":\nIn some places this natural disaster has resulted in splendid vistas- views long since forgotten by some and never before seen by a whole new generation. Because of gaps left by fallen trees, visitors to Arundel Castle, the ancestral home of the Dukes of Norfolk, can now look out over the picturesque town... At the renowned woodland rhododendron garden at Leonardslee, Sussex, the gale... opened magnificent views by removing about a thousand trees which owner Robin Loder said he would never have had the courage to thin out himself.\n\nFollowing the storm meteorologists at the University of Reading led by Professor Keith Browning developed the Sting jet concept. During reanalysis of the storm they identified a mesoscale flow where the most damaging winds were shown to be emanating from the evaporating tip of the hooked cloud head on the southern flank of the cyclone. This cloud, hooked like a scorpion's tail, gives the wind region its name the \"Sting Jet\".\n\nThe Met Office was severely criticised by most of the national press for failing to forecast the storm correctly.\n\nThe Met Office conducted an internal inquiry, scrutinised by two independent assessors, and a number of recommendations were made. Chiefly, observational coverage of the atmosphere over the ocean to the south and west of the UK was improved by increasing the quality and quantity of observations from ships, aircraft, buoys and satellites. Continued refinements were made to the computer models used in forecasting, and changes were made in the training of forecasters. In addition, reforms in the way the Met Office reports warnings of severe weather were implemented, leading to substantially more warnings being issued in the future. Further deployment of improved tracking devices and improvements in the computer model simulations were supported by the purchase of an additional Cray supercomputer. Warnings for the Burns' Day Storm just over two years later were accurate and on time, although the model forecast hinged on observations from two ships in the Atlantic near the developing storm the day before it reached the UK.\nBBC meteorologist Michael Fish drew particular criticism for reporting several hours before the storm hit: Earlier on today, apparently, a woman rang the BBC and said she heard there was a hurricane on the way; well, if you're watching, don't worry, there isn't, but having said that, actually, the weather will become very windy, but most of the strong winds, incidentally, will be down over Spain and across into France.\n\nFish has subsequently claimed that his comments about a hurricane had nothing to do with the UK; they referred to Florida, USA, and were linked to a news story immediately preceding the weather bulletin, but had been so widely repeated out of context that the British public remains convinced that he was referring to the approaching storm. According to Fish, the woman in question was actually a colleague's mother who was about to go on holiday in the Caribbean, and had called regarding (the already long-dissipated) Hurricane Floyd to see if it would be safe to travel. Fish has also claimed that \"nobody phoned up\" and that she was a \"non-existing woman\", apparently contradicting the previous declaration, when interviewed about Anita Hart's claims of being the woman who made the call.\n\nFish went on to warn viewers that it would be \"very windy\" across the south of England, but predicted that the storm would move further south along the English Channel and the British mainland would escape the worst effects. The remainder of his warning is frequently left out of re-runs, which only adds to the public's misconception of that day's forecasting. His analysis has been defended by weather experts. In particular, the lack of a weather ship in the Southwest Approaches, due to Met Office cutbacks, meant the only manner of tracking the storm was by using satellite data, as automatic buoys had not been deployed at the time.\n\nIronically, earlier forecasts as far back as the preceding weekend had correctly identified that gale-force winds would affect Southern England. However, later runs of the model had indicated a more southerly track for the low pressure system, incorrectly indicating that the strongest winds would be confined to Northern and Central France. The French meteorological office used a different computer weather model to the British, and the French model proved more accurate in predicting the severity of the storm in the Channel.\n\nIn the wake of the storm the Met Office set up the National Severe Weather Warning Service.\n\nIt is claimed this storm was the worst since the Great Storm of 1703, which has been challenged as a myth. Storms of this strength regularly form over the North Atlantic, where they typically track to the north of Scotland. Storms of such a strength have a return period of 30 to 40 years. The unusual aspect of the storm was that it struck the densely populated southeast of England. That winds in the South East had return periods of 1 in 200 years does not mean the winds of this strength occur once every 200 years, but that the winds have a 0.5% probability of happening in a given year.\n\nFollowing this storm 1.3 million incidents of damage were reported, which is only exceeded by the Gale of January 1976 where destruction covered a wider area of the UK, with 1.5 million incidents of damage reported. The Burns' Day storm hit the United Kingdom in January 1990, less than three years later and with comparable intensity.\n\nFollowing the storm few dealers made it to their desks and stock market trading was suspended twice and the market closed early at 12.30pm. The disruption meant the City was unable to respond to the late dealings at the beginning of the Wall Street fall-out on Friday 16 October, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average recorded its biggest-ever one-day slide at the time, a fall of 108.36. City traders and investors spent the weekend, 17–18 October, repairing damaged gardens in between trying to guess market reaction and assessing the damage. 19 October, Black Monday, was memorable as being the first business day of the London markets after the Great Storm.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26815201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26815201", "title": "Gustavo III (Verdi)", "text": "Gustavo III (Verdi)\n\nGustavo III is an opera by Giuseppe Verdi to a libretto begun in early 1857 by the Italian playwright Antonio Somma. Never performed as written, the libretto was later revised (or proposed to be revised) several times under two additional names – \"Una vendetta in domino\" and \"Adelia degli Adimari\" – during which the setting was changed to vastly different locations. Eventually, it was agreed that it could be called \"Un ballo in maschera\", the one by which it is known today, but Verdi was forced to accept that the location of the story would have to be Colonial Boston. This setting became the \"standard\" one until the mid-20th Century. Most productions today locate the action in Sweden.\n\nHowever, a \"hypothetical reconstruction\" of \"Gustavo III\" under its original name was performed by the Gothenburg Opera in Sweden during the 2002/03 season.\n\nIn early 1856 Vincenzo Torelli, secretary to the Teatro San Carlo's management approached Verdi with a contract offer, the proposed opera being \"Re Lear\", an opera based on Shakespeare's \"King Lear\". It was known to be a subject dear to the composer, but this libretto, for which Somma and Verdi had worked for some time, raised concerns for Verdi, not the least of which was finding a suitable cast in Naples, given the practice of a company engaging a group of singers for an entire season and giving them the major roles to sing in all productions, thus forcing a composer to take into account their strengths and weaknesses in the roles he was creating.\n\nEven though it proved to be impracticable to continue with \"Re Lear\", Verdi signed a contract in February 1857 for performances during the 1857/58 carnival season, but, as the year progressed and with time running out, he had misgivings and failed to meet commitments regarding \"Lear\". Finally, in a letter which he wrote to Torelli in September 1857, Verdi confessed that he had \"looked through an infinite number of plays...but not one of them will do for me...\" but he then described an existing libretto which interested him, one which was written by the French playwright and librettist Eugene Scribe for Daniel Auber's very successful 1833 opera, \"Gustave III, ou Le bal masqué\": \n\nVerdi turned to the historical subject of King Gustav III of Sweden, who was shot while attending a masked ball in Stockholm in 1792 and died thirteen days later. Anckarström, his assassin, was executed. Although noting it as \"a French drama\",\n\nIn his version, Scribe had retained the names of some of the historical figures involved including Gustave, Anckarström (the king's secretary and his best friend), Ulrica Arfvidsson (the fortune teller), and conspirators Ribbing and Horn; the conspiracy itself; and the killing at the masked ball. As noted by Budden, Scribe invented much of the rest of the action, including Gustav's romance with the fictional Amélie (Anckarström's wife) and he added characters and situations such as the page boy, Oscar. \"It was a simple case of 'cherchez la femme'\" says Budden, who sees Scribe using the romance as the reason for the murder (rather than the purely political motive behind the actual event) and he describes the plot of Scribe's libretto as \"cleverly constructed...in which irony follows irony. It abounds in striking situations and \"coups de théatre\"; it offers opportunities for a display of the most intense and varied emotions; and it is full of suspense.\"\n\nThroughout the autumn of 1857 correspondence between librettist and composer flowed regularly, and on 19 October, Verdi sent a synopsis to Torelli. He immediately received a reply warning him that \"a change of locale would be necessary at the very least and the poet had better be advised of this.\" While Verdi did not necessarily see a problem in changing location, he did lament the loss of other things: \"what a pity to have to give up the pomp of a court like that of Gustavo III. Then too it will be difficult to find another monarch on the lines of that Gustavo. Poor poets, poor composers\"\n\nWhen Somma's verses (to which Verdi had contributed a significant amount, including an initial prose outline) were sent to the composer by late November 1857, the outline of the opera was complete, and Verdi began to create musical sketches of significant scenes. At the same time, word came of the seven requirements imposed by the Naples censorship. These included that (i) \"The King must become a Duke\"; (ii) \"the action must be transferred to a pre-Christian age\"; (iii) the conspirators must not hate the Duke because they wanted to take power; and (iv) \"no firearms\".\n\nSomma had several suggestions, including a possible new title, \"Il duca Ermanno\" with a 12th Century setting, which Verdi rejected; but he did accept the proposed change to Pomerania. The pair spent Christmas of 1857 together working on changes. However, Somma insisted that his name be changed on the libretto to \"Tommaso Anoni\".\n\nDiscussions with the censors eventually resulted in the location being changed to Stettin in Pomerania in Northern Germany, the main character becoming a Duke, and the title becoming \"Una vendetta in domino\". A compromise seemed to have been reached. However, as has been noted, \"Verdi did not begin preparing the skeleton score for \"Una vendetta\" before composer and versifier decided on the Pomeranian setting\"\n\nAfter an arduous journey, Verdi arrived in Naples in January 1858. He brought with him the skeleton score and this was handed over to Torelli. With the major issues seeming to have been resolved and rehearsals of \"Un vendetta\" about to begin, an attempt to assassinate Emperor Napoleon III in Paris by three Italians led by Felice Orsini occurred on 14 January 1858.\n\nAfter attempting to obtain agreement on the singers during his first ten days in Naples, Verdi finally discovered that the company's management had withheld the news that the censors had refused to approve the libretto some three months before. Now, with the latest news regarding the Emperor, the Naples Chief of Police had ruled the opera's text would have to be entirely re-written. Verdi regarded this as outrageous and, in his letter to Somma, he laid out his objections to their list of demands:\n\nIn between this correspondence with his librettist, Verdi hit upon an important musical point with Torelli regarding his feelings about the impossibility of changing the character of Gustavo. The composer says that to do so would make everything:\n\nIf these kind of changes were to be made, Somma replied later, then he would insist that the title be changed and \"another author be credited with the words\" The opera would no longer be his.\n\nWhen the manuscript of \"Una Vendetta\" was returned to him, Verdi found that it been renamed \"Adelia degli Adimari\" and now set in 14th Century Florence. Even worse, he noted that of \"Una Vendetta\"s 884 lines, 297 had been changed in \"Adelia\". Although Torelli attempted to get the composer to compromise and meet with the censor on 20 February, Verdi dug in his heels and, in his reply to Torelli, refused to accept any changes: \"...I cannot commit the monstrosities that were inflicted here (Naples) on \"Rigoletto\" \", referring to how that opera had been butchered by the censors when it was presented in his absence a few years before. Rejecting any involvement with \"Adelia\", a lawsuit was then set in place by the theatre for breach of contract. In his counter suit, Verdi claimed damages and, in the document which he prepared called \"Defense of Maestro Cavalier Giuseppe Verdi\" and in which he gave instructions to his lawyer, he laid what he regarded as the absurdity of some of the requirements. These included the substitution of one word of the opening chorus' \"Die!\" for \"He sleeps\". In addition, it has been noted that he instructed a copyist to \"place the two librettos (\"Vendetta\" and \"Adelia\")in parallel columns\"\n\nIn summary, Verdi rhetorically asks:\n\nThe counter suit was presented to the Commercial Court in Naples on 13 March, and Verdi's efforts were rewarded with the Court's ruling that there was merit to the case and its injunction for the parties to reach agreement. This allowed Verdi to leave Naples with his score in hand, but promising to return to Naples later in the year to stage at least one of his other operas.\n\nHowever, while many of the negotiations noted above were proceeding, Verdi became determined to find another location for his opera. In March 1858, after contacting his friend, the sculptor Vincenzo Luccardi in Rome, and requesting information on the performances of a play \"Gustavo III\" currently being presented there, he proposed that Rome stage the work. Verdi sent the libretto of the opera under the name of \"Gustavo III\", which at that point was identical to \"Una vendetta\" but with the original setting and names restored.\n\nWhen Jacovacci, impresario of the Teatro Apollo (where \"Il trovatore\" had been presented successfully) received the libretto, his reaction was encouraging, but he warned the composer that there may be problems with the censor. Verdi was surprised: \"In Rome they allow \"Gustavo III\" as a spoken play but won't allow a libretto on the same subject. Very strange!\"\n\nAt first, Verdi wanted the libretto returned, but Jacovacci's persistence prevailed, and it was found that the censors did not insist on such dramatic changes as originally had been thought possible. However, the censors' prime demand was the requirement that \"Gustavo III\" be set elsewhere than in Europe. Verdi proposed Boston in the 17th Century to Somma, alternatively \"the Caucasus perhaps?\" His letter began: \"Arm yourself with courage and patience. Particularly with patience...Remember that under present conditions our best plan is to present the opera in Rome...\".\n\nEventually, when the censors refused to allow a Duke, Somma came up with \"Riccardo Conte di Varvich (Warwick)\" and then refused to make other changes; that was acceptable to all. Once again, Somma refused to have his name appear on the libretto.\n\nBy 11 September 1858, Verdi wrote to Somma accepting the revised changes in \"Gustavo III\", but renamed it as \"Un ballo in maschera\". Until his arrival in Rome in January 1859, Verdi was involved in completing and orchestrating the opera. Basing it as he did on the skeleton score of \"Una vendetta\", Verdi transformed the setting and characters' names to fit the requirements. The score's text required modification to agree with \"Ballo\" and not \"Una vendetta\", orchestration was completed, and musical changes and adjustments were made. Significant changes in the music occurred after 11 September and are also detailed by Gossett.\n\nThe first performance of the new opera was presented on 17 February 1859.\n\nBy about 1870, after \"Ballo\" had become successful and when Italian unification removed much of regional censorship, Verdi could probably have returned the opera to its original Swedish setting, but he never did so. Until the mid-20th Century, the \"standard\" location of \"Ballo\" remained in the United States.\n\nToday, \"Ballo\" has become part of the standard repertory and is often performed.\n\n\"Gustavo III\" disappeared for close to one hundred and fifty years, but it again made an appearance with the publication of the critical edition of \"Un ballo in maschera\" and the subsequent \"hypothetical reconstruction\", based on the unorchestrated original and much of \"Una vendetta\" \"grafted\" onto \"Un ballo\"s score.\n\nThe complete history of \"Gustavo III\" has been outlined by musicologist Philip Gossett in his \"Divas and Scholars\" but, as noted by George Loomis, for the 25% of the score which is lost \"Gossett and (Ilaria) Narici (who edited the critical edition) had to use an earlier sketched version at Sant'Agata that spans the entire opera (with some gaps) but consists largely of only the melodic line. Gossett says that the sketched draft nevertheless permits one conversant with Verdi's style to reconstruct the original with a reasonable degree of probability. And the opera's final version often supplies guidance in matters of harmony and orchestration.\"\n\n\"Gustavo III\" was presented by the Gothenburg Opera in Gothenburg, Sweden during the 2002/03 season, 146 years after Verdi took his libretto for \"Gustavo III\" away from the Teatro San Carlo in Naples. \"Gustavo III\" was given at the San Carlo in January/February 2004.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}

He died at his home in Solana Beach, California, on September 29, 2013.\n\nHarold Melvin Agnew was born in Denver, Colorado on March 28, 1921, the only child of a pair of stonecutters. He attended South Denver High School and entered the University of Denver, where he majored in chemistry. He was a strong athlete who pitched for the university softball that won a championship. He left the University of Denver in January 1942, but had enough credits to graduate Phi Beta Kappa with his Bachelor of Arts degree in June, and he received a scholarship to Yale University.\n\nAfter the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor brought the United States into the Pacific War, Agnew and his girlfriend Beverly, a fellow graduate of South Denver High School and the University of Denver, attempted to join the United States Army Air Corps together. They were persuaded not to sign the enlistment papers. Instead, Joyce C. Stearns, the head of the physics department at the University of Denver, persuaded Agnew to come with him to the University of Chicago, where Stearns became the deputy head of the Metallurgical Laboratory. Although Agnew had enough credits to graduate, Beverly did not and had to remain behind. They were married in Denver on May 2, 1942. They then went to Chicago, where Beverly became a secretary to Richard L. Doan, then head of the Metallurgical Laboratory. Agnew and Beverly had two children, a daughter Nancy, and a son, John.\nAt the Metallurgical Laboratory, Agnew worked with Enrico Fermi, Walter Zinn and Herbert L. Anderson. There, he was involved in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Initially, Agnew worked with the instrumentation. The Geiger counters were calibrated using a radon-beryllium source, and Agnew received too high a dose of radiation. He was then put to work stacking the graphite bricks that were the reactor's neutron moderator. He witnessed the first controlled nuclear chain reaction when the reactor went critical on December 2, 1942.\n\nAgnew and Beverly moved to the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, where the men disassembled the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all the parts. The parts were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, for the rest of the war. Agnew's job was to reassemble the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group.\n\nWhen experimental work wound down, Agnew was transferred to Project Alberta, working as part of Luis W. Alvarez's group, whose role was to monitor the yield of nuclear explosions. With Alvarez and Lawrence H. Johnston, Agnew had devised a method for measuring the yield of the nuclear blast by dropping pressure gauges on parachutes and telemetering the readings back to the plane. In June 1945, he was issued with an Army uniform and dog tags at Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, and was flown to Tinian in the Western Pacific in a C-54 of the 509th Composite Group. Agnew's first task was to install his yield measurement instrumentation in the Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft \"The Great Artiste\".\n\nDuring the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, on August 6, 1945, Agnew, along with Alvarez and Johnston, flew as a scientific observer in \"The Great Artiste\", piloted by Charles Sweeney, which tailed the \"Enola Gay\" as the instrumentation aircraft. Agnew later recalled, \"After we dropped our gauges I remember we made a sharp turn to the right so that we would not get caught in the blast – but we still got badly shaken up by it.\" He brought along a movie camera and took the only existing movies of the Hiroshima event as seen from the air.\n\nAfter the war ended, Agnew entered the University of Chicago, where he completed his graduate work under Fermi. Agnew and Beverly stayed with Fermi and his family, due to the post-war housing shortage. He received his Master of Science (MS) degree in 1948 and his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1949, writing his thesis on \"The beta-spectra of Cs137, Y91, Pm147, Ru106, Sm151, P32, Tm170\". Fellow postgraduate students at Chicago at the time included Tsung-Dao Lee, Chen Ning Yang, Owen Chamberlain and Jack Steinberger.\n\nWith his doctorate in hand, Agnew returned to Los Alamos as a National Research Foundation Fellow, and worked on weapons development in the Physics Division. In 1950, he was assigned to the thermonuclear weapons project, and was project engineer for the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll in 1954. He became head of the Weapon Nuclear Engineering Division in 1964.\n\nAgnew served as a Democratic New Mexico State Senator from 1955 to 1961. He was the first state senator to be elected from Los Alamos County. Senators served unpaid, receiving only a per diem allowance of five dollars. Since the New Mexico legislature convened for only 30 days in even numbered years and 60 days in odd numbered years, he was able to continue working at Los Alamos, taking leave without pay to attend. He attempted to reform New Mexico's liquor laws, which specified a minimum mark-up. He was unsuccessful in 1957, but the law was reformed in 1963.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1964, he was Scientific Adviser to the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). He also held a number of part-time advisory position with the military over the years. He was a member of the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board from 1957 to 1968, and was chairman of the Science Advisory Group of the United States Army's Combat Development Command from 1966 to 1970. He was a member of the Defense Science Board from 1966 to 1970, the Army's Scientific Advisory Panel from 1966 to 1974, and the Army Science Board from 1978 to 1984.\n\nAgnew became director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1970, when it had 7,000 employees. He took over at a time of great change. His predecessor, Norris Bradbury, had rebuilt the laboratory from scratch after the war, and many of the people he had brought in were approaching retirement. Under his directorship, Los Alamos developed an underground test containment program, completed its Meson Physics Facility, acquired the first Cray supercomputer, and trained the first class of International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors. Agnew managed to get the Los Alamos Laboratory responsibility for the development of the W76, used by the Trident I and Trident II Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles, and the W78 used by the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles. He was proud of the work with insensitive high explosive that made nuclear weapons safer to handle. Support from the Atomic Energy Commission for reactor development dried up, but during the 1970s energy crisis, the laboratory explored other types of alternative fuels.\n\nIn 1979, Agnew resigned from Los Alamos and became President and Chief Executive Officer of General Atomics, a position he held until 1985. In his letter of resignation to David S. Saxon, the President of the University of California, Agnew wrote that his decision was influenced by \"dissatisfaction with University administration policies and a lack of advocacy for the total LASL [Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory] program\" and \"frustration with what I consider to be a continuing inequitable distribution of defense program funding by the Department of Energy between the LASL and LLL [Lawrence Livermore Laboratory].\"\nAgnew chaired the General Advisory Committee of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency from 1974 to 1978, and served as a White House science councillor from 1982 to 1989. He was a member of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel from 1968 to 1974, and from 1978 to 1987. He became an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego in 1988. He was the recipient of the E.O. Lawrence Award in 1966, and of the Department of Energy's Enrico Fermi Award in 1978. Along with Hans Bethe, Agnew was the first to receive the Los Alamos National Laboratory Medal. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nA proponent of tactical nuclear weapons, Agnew pointed out in 1970 that the Thanh Hoa Bridge in Vietnam required hundreds of sorties to destroy with conventional weapons when a nuclear weapon could have done the job with just one. In a 1977 article for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Agnew argued that the fusion reactions of neutron bombs could provide \"tactical\" advantages over conventional fission weapons, especially in countering the \"massive armor component possessed by the Eastern bloc.\" Citing conclusions reached by the Rand Corporation, Agnew argued that without affecting the armor of a tank, the neutrons produced by a fusion blast would penetrate the vehicle and \"in a matter of a few tens of minutes to hours kill or make the crew completely ineffective.\" Because the neutron bomb reduced collateral damage, it could be used in a much more selective fashion than a fission weapon, thereby providing a clear \"advantage for the military defender as well as for the nearby non-combatant.\"\n\nAgnew maintained that no new U.S. nuclear weapon design could be certified without nuclear testing, and that stockpile reliability stewardship without such testing may be problematic. In a 1999 letter to the \"Wall Street Journal\", he commented on the significance of allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage. \"As long as any nation has a demonstrated nuclear capability and a means of delivering its bombs and warheads, it doesn't really matter whether the warheads are a little smaller or painted a color other than red, white, and blue,\" he wrote. \"I suspect information published in the open by the National [sic.] Resources Defense Council has been as useful to other nations as any computer codes they may have received by illegal means.\"\n\nBeverly died on October 11, 2011. Agnew was diagnosed of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and died at his home in Solana Beach, California, on September 29, 2013, while watching football on television. He was survived by his daughter Nancy and son John. He had arranged to be cremated and his ashes interred with Beverly's at the Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.\n\nIn a 2005 BBC interview, Agnew stated, \"About three-quarters of the U.S. nuclear arsenal was designed under my tutelage at Los Alamos. That is my legacy.\"\n\n"}

It is a serious medical emergency but the extent of severity depends on bleeding rate and location of the bleeding (e.g. heart, brain, stomach, lungs). It can cause death and cardiac arrest if proper medical treatment is not received quickly.\n\nA number of medical conditions may lead to internal bleeding. Common causes include trauma, various pathological conditions and complications of medical therapy. Common locations include the gastrointestinal tract, the aorta and intracranial hemorrhage. A bruise is a form of internal bleeding. Bruises occur most often when blunt force trauma breaks small blood vessels inside the body, causing blood to leak out into surrounding tissue. If the blood leaks into tissue that is near the surface of the skin, this bleeding is visible as a discoloration of the skin called a bruise or contusion. Bruises are among the most common injuries and they are often minor, but bruises can sometimes be very severe in the case of serious injuries.\n\nInternal bleeding can be caused by blunt trauma such as high speed deceleration in an automobile accident, or by penetrating trauma such as a ballistic or stab wound.\n\nA number of pathological conditions and diseases can lead to internal bleeding. These include blood vessel rupture as a result of high blood pressure, aneurysms, esophageal varices or peptic ulcers.\nAnother common cause of internal bleeding is carcinoma (cancer), either of the gastro-intestinal tract, of the lung, or more rarely of other organs such as the prostate, pancreas or kidney.\nOther diseases linked to internal bleeding include scurvy, hepatoma, liver cancer, Autoimmune Thrombocytopenia, ectopic pregnancy, malignant hypothermia, ovarian cysts, Vitamin K Deficiency, and hemophilia and malaria. Some viruses may cause a type of internal bleeding called viral hemorrhagic fever, such as the Ebola, Dengue or Marburg viruses, but these are rare.\n\nInternal bleeding could be an iatrogenic artifact as a result of complications after surgical operations or medical treatment.\nSome medication effects may also lead to internal bleeding, such as the use of anticoagulant drugs or antiplatelet drugs in the treatment of coronary artery disease.\n\nInternal bleeding is serious for two reasons:\nIf there is pressure, it may lead to death or a brain hemorrhage.\n\nCases of internal bleeding are usually termed as hemorrhage, even though the term is general to all kinds of bleeding. A minor case of internal bleeding results in ecchymosis, or a bruise: blood expands under the skin, causing discoloration.\n"}

It was dedicated on 30 September 1895 by Lillian Russell, one of the most well known actress of the time, who was there to perform in \"Tzigane\". Reginald De Koven, composer of the opera, led the orchestra at Russell's request. In 1905 it was purchased by the Shuberts and David Belasco and was renamed the Belasco Theatre. The theatre was acquired by the US federal government and used as a warehouse until World War II, when it was operated by the American Theatre Wing as a Stage Door Canteen. During the Korean War, it was used by the United Services Organization to entertain troops. The theater was razed in 1964.\n\nThe Lafayette Square Opera House as built by John W. Albaugh, on behalf of the Lafayette Square Opera House Company. It was completed in September 1895 at a cost of 250,000 dollars ($ in present day terms). Located on Madison Place NW, just north of Pennsylvania Avenue, the theater faced Lafayette Square and the White House. The site, originally the home of Commodore John Rodgers, was noted for a history of tragic events and believed to be haunted. It was there that Congressman, later Civil War General, Daniel Sickles killed the district attorney for the District of Columbia, Philip Barton Key II, son of Francis Scott Key. Following the Civil War, John Wilkes Booth's co-conspirator, Lewis Powell, attempted to take the life of Secretary of State William H. Seward, who was living there at the time. The property was later purchased by former Secretary of State James G. Blaine, and it was there that he and two of his children, Walker and Alice, died.\n\nThe structure was built of polished gray granite in the classic Grecian order style. Its frontage was 76 feet wide and 176 feet deep. The steel frame building, equipped with the latest fireproof rigging of the time and using an asbestos stage curtain, was advertised is being absolutely fireproof. The main entrance was thirty-six feet wide, and opened directly to the sidewalk on Madison Place. The lobby was finished in mahogany with mosaic tile flooring. Broad marble staircases on either side led to the upper floors. The main floor rose five tiers, constructed on the cantilever, with two Ionic columns on the main floor and three in the balconies. The mezzanine was divided into 31 stalls, one for each President of the United States at that time, each seating four to eight people. The theater had 1,800 seats, \"not one from which actors can not be seen.\"\n\nThe wrought steel front railings of the boxes and balconies were designed by Trost & Trost Architects. The interior was finished in the Italian renaissance style. On the asbestos stage curtain was a copy of Fernand Cormon's painting, \"Les Vainqueurs de Salamine\". The stage itself was 68 feet wide and 45 feet deep. The roof was constructed for use as a theater in the summer months, with seating up to 1,500. The basement was used primarily for a Turkish bath, but did include a barber shop and restrooms.\nIn September 1905 it was purchased by the S. S. Shubert Amusement Company and David Belasco for 225,000 dollars ($ in present day terms). It reopened in October as the Belasco Theater. In the 1930s, it was converted to a movie house. \n\nIn 1940 the Belasco Theatre and its neighboring properties were acquired by the federal government. The theater, with its seats removed, was used as a warehouse until World War II, when parts of it were used by the American Theatre Wing as a Stage Door Canteen. During the Korean War, it was used by the United Services Organization to entertain troops. The theater was razed in 1964 and the site is now home to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims Building.\n"}

Travis was named in a Federal criminal complaint for the murders of two women. At the time of the murders, Travis was a waiter and on parole for a robbery in 1989. While in his letter Travis claimed to have murdered 17 women, some authorities were doubtful; others thought he may have murdered up to 20 women.\n\nAt least one videotape of Travis murdering and/or persecuting some of his victims was found in the search of his home. He is believed to have killed two women, Alysia Greenwade, whose body was discovered 1 April 2001 in Illinois (after having been last seen in Missouri), and Betty James, whose body was discovered about two months later in Missouri (after having been last seen in Illinois). Although Travis appears to acknowledge at least 17 murders, the police believe his victim count could be as high as 20.\n\nFrom May to October 2001 four other women were tortured and strangled: Teresa Wilson, Verona Thompson, Yvonne Crues and Brenda Beasley. \"The St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" ran a profile piece on Wilson, and Travis responded to it anonymously with a letter and a map. The letter had a return address of I THRALLDOM, a web bondage site, but no other identification. However, the map was recognized to have come from Expedia.com, and further investigation traced it back to Travis, who was arrested.\n\nIn the letter he said, \"I'll tell you where many others are.\" And then: \"To prove I'm real, here's directions to number seventeen.\" Travis was arrested on a federal criminal complaint and, while in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, was housed at a St. Louis County jail facility in Clayton, Missouri. Investigators discovered a torture chamber at Travis' residence, instruments of torture, a stun gun, newspaper clippings of some of his crimes, and videotapes of Travis committing some of his crimes.\n\nBefore he could be put on trial or sentenced for the crimes, Travis hanged himself on June 10, 2002, in his jail cell in St. Louis County Jail after jailers trained in suicide watch failed to show up to check on him.\n\n\"Forensic Files\" covered the story of his crime spree. The episode was titled \"X Marks the Spot\". \"Cold Case Files\" also covered the story, in an episode entitled \"A Map to Murder\". \"Evil, I\" also covered this story in an episode entitled \"Hell's Basement\".\n\nAfter watching the \"Cold Case Files\" documentary on the A&E network, the current tenant of Travis' house found out about the house's history. It was revealed that her landlord, who would not return the money or break the lease when confronted, was Travis' mother. Upon being approached by the local housing authority the landlord subsequently agreed to rescind the lease.\n"}
{"id": "9924356", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9924356", "title": "Murder of Romona Moore", "text": "Murder of Romona Moore\n\nRomona Moore (1982 – April 2003) was a 21-year-old Hunter College honors student who disappeared April 24, 2003 in Brooklyn, New York. Two months later, her body was discovered outside an abandoned house where an anonymous caller had directed her mother. Two male suspects were arrested; they were convicted in 2006 of having kidnapped, raped, tortured, and murdered Moore. While attending college, the young immigrant from Guyana was living at home with her parents and relatives.\n\nThe two men were sentenced to life in prison without parole for the murder and other charges related to Moore, with an additional 22 years for their escape attempt in January 2006 during the trial. In a separate trial during this period, the two suspects were also convicted of having abducted and raped a 15-year-old girl in 2003 soon after Moore's murder. The girl had escaped from them and gone to police. Her report contributed to their apprehension in the Moore case.\n\nIn 2008, Moore's mother Ellie Carmichael filed a suit in federal district court against the New York Police Department (NYPD), charging its officials with racial bias in how they handled cases of missing persons; the suit was accepted for trial. Carmichael contrasted the NYPD's treatment of her daughter's case with that of a white rare book dealer from the Upper West Side who disappeared about the same time. In August 2014, the federal judge dismissed the case, saying there was no evidence of systemic racial bias within the department on this issue.\n\nBorn in Guyana, Moore immigrated with her parents to New York City, where they settled in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Relatives from Guyana also lived there. After attending local schools, Moore entered Hunter College. A responsible high achiever, in 2003 she was a third-year psychology honors student.\n\nMoore was last seen by her family when she left home on April 24 at approximately 7:30 p.m. to meet a friend. She left the friend around 9:00 p.m., saying she was going to eat at a Burger King restaurant at Church and Remsen avenues. Moore apparently never reached the restaurant, and was not seen again by family or friends. When Moore's mother reported her missing the next day, the police said that perhaps the girl was with friends, declining to open the case despite the mother's protests about knowing her daughter's habits. The family posted their own photos and fliers in the neighborhood, hoping to gain information about Romona's disappearance. The police did not open a case on the missing young woman until April 28. In addition to their downplaying family concern when the student disappeared, the initial police reports about her murder mistakenly spelled Moore's first name as \"Ramona.\"\n\nAbout the same time as Moore's disappearance, police in Manhattan were publicizing their investigation of the disappearance of Svetlana Aronov, a rare book dealer reported missing by her husband. They held a press conference and displayed a large photo of the missing woman to make the public aware. Aronov's body was found drowned in the East River a few months later.\n\nSeveral days after Moore's disappearance, a 15-year-old girl in Brooklyn reported to police that she had been abducted by two men and taken to an empty house where she was raped by them. She escaped and contacted authorities.\n\nAbout two months after Moore disappeared, her mother Ellie Carmichael received an anonymous phone call, telling her to go to an address on King's Highway. The police have not identified the caller. The mother contacted police, and officers from the 67th Precinct and Emergency Service Units searched the premises of an abandoned, burned house. They discovered Moore's nude body outside, wrapped in a blanket. Police sources said that the young woman had been beaten severely about her head and chest. The basement had been flooded in an apparent attempt to destroy forensic evidence.\n\nTwo male suspects were arrested in the Moore case, in part aided by the report of the 15-year-old girl they had attacked. In 2004 the Brooklyn DA was reported to be seeking the death penalty against the two defendants, who were indicted on five counts of 1st-degree murder, among other charges, for allegedly kidnapping, raping and murdering Romona Moore, 21. They faced separate charges for their attack on the 15-year-old.\n\nThe details of Moore's kidnapping, captivity, and murder were recounted in the prosecutor's opening statement at the trial, which started on January 18, 2006:\n\nProsecutor Anna-Sigga Nicolazzi said two thugs terrorized Romona Moore for days in a Brooklyn basement in April 2003, repeatedly raping her and attacking her with a knife, a saw, a hammer and a barbell. Defendants Troy Hendrix, 22, and Kayson Pearson, 23, are also charged with kidnapping and raping a 15-year-old girl days after they allegedly killed Moore. \"Romona Moore's injuries are indescribable,' said Nicolazzi. \"The horror she endured, the torture she endured will become clear.\"\n\nAdditional details were revealed in testimony about evidence.\n\nRomando Jack, a friend of Hendrix and Pearson, testified to seeing Moore chained and held as a captive by Pearson and Hendrix in the basement of a house but at the time did not report this to the police; he went to a baby shower and later returned home to Maryland. Jack told his fiancée and her uncle about the young woman being abused and held captive. He said during the trial that he thought his uncle may have called the police. A female witness testified in court, but changed her testimony three times. She said she had also suffered sexual abuse and beatings.\n\nThe courtroom was thrown into chaos on January 19, 2006, when defendant Pearson stabbed his attorney on his way out of the courtroom. Defendant Hendrix jumped a barricade and tried to take a gun from one of the bailiffs, in order to make their escape. Both men were subdued by officers. The two men were charged with \"assault, resisting arrest and attempted escape.\"\n\nThe judge declared a mistrial due to Pearson's attack on his lawyer in the courtroom. New charges were brought against the two defendants for their attack, and a new trial was quickly scheduled.\n\nA second kidnapping and murder trial was begun.\n\nOn March 23, 2006, the district attorney announced the jury conviction of Hendrix and Pearson on charges of kidnapping, rape, torture and first-degree murder of Romona Moore, 21. They were reputedly members of the Bloods gang.\n\nAfter the verdict was announced, Moore's mother Ellie Carmichael spoke to the press in front of TV cameras; she said she had received justice inside the courtroom if not outside, and strongly criticized press and police for their conduct since her daughter's disappearance and murder. She said, \"All I got was nothing but disrespect from the media and the police.\"\n\nOn April 11, 2006, Pearson and Hendrix were both sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. They received an additional 22 years for their attacks in the court while seeking escape.\n\nAs Moore's family awaited sentencing of the convicted defendants, their daughter's case was superseded by media attention related to the announcement of a grand jury indictment across the street in another courtroom in the abduction and murder of Imette St. Guillen, a graduate student at John Jay College of Criminal Justice who had lived on the Upper West Side. She had also been tortured and raped before her death.\n\nMoore's family felt that in 2003, when their daughter disappeared, neither the police nor the press took her case seriously. They did not search as hard for her as for Svetlana Aronov, a white art rare book dealer who had disappeared in Manhattan at about the same time, nor did they have a press conference to call attention to the honor student's disappearance. The Moore relatives initially had posted fliers in their neighborhood when the police declined to open an investigation, saying that sometimes young people took off for a few days. It turned out that Moore was still alive and subject to torture when the police closed her case. The police have said that other circumstances in the Moore and Aronov cases were different.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the trial of the murderers of her daughter, on April 3, 2008, Moore's mother Elle Carmichael filed a federal lawsuit against the NYPD, alleging that they did not take sufficient action in cases of missing black women and girls. The historic racial-bias lawsuit was cleared for trial by Brooklyn Federal District Judge Nina Gershon. \n\nCarmichael is claiming that NYPD \"used a double standard\" by not mounting a vigorous search for Moore while \"aggressively pursuing the disappearance of white women.\" The police at the 67th Precinct had rejected Carmichael's initial request to search for her daughter by saying that \"she was probably off with a boyfriend.\" Carmichael contrasted the NYPD's actions in failing to investigate the disappearance of her daughter with their pursuit of evidence in the case of Svetlana Aronov, a white woman. City Attorney Robyn Pullio indicated that she was looking forward to a hearing in this case so that all facts could be heard.\n\nIn August 2014, Federal District Judge Nina Gershon dismissed Carmichael's bias case, ruling that there was no evidence to show there was \"a widespread, racially-motivated practice within the NYPD of delays in listing minorities missing or investigating the circumstances.\" She acknowledged there could be differences among specific cases, but said systemic bias was not shown.\n\nThe ABC television series \"NYPD 24/7\" in 2004 featured a seven-episode, weekly series about the police, with extensive coverage by film crews to convey the truth of the officers' jobs.<ref name=\"NYPD24/7\"></ref> Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly in the Mayor Michael Bloomberg administration agreed to have the \"fabled\" department filmed. A total of 2,000 hours of film was shot over 16 months for the series. The July 13, 2004 episode featured unfolding elements of the earlier Romona Moore investigation.\n"}

Known colloquially as The Lyon Sisters, their case resulted in one of the largest police investigations in Washington Metropolitan Area history. \n\nIn 2013, a team of cold case investigators with the Montgomery County, Maryland, police made a break in the case. They focused on Lloyd Lee Welch, Jr., then serving a lengthy prison sentence in Delaware for child sexual abuse, the culmination of a long criminal record that had begun a few years after the girls' disappearance with a burglary arrest in their jurisdiction. In September 2017, Welch pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder for the abduction and murder of the two sisters. It had long been \"one of the most high-profile unsolved cases in the D.C. area.\" The girls' remains have never been found.\n\nPolice records show that during the original investigation, Welch came forward a week after the girls' disappearance and falsely told a security guard at the shopping center visited by the girls (immediately before they disappeared) that he had witnessed another man abduct them there. The description Welch provided of the other man matched a description that newspapers and other media already had provided the public. According to that description, a conservatively dressed man had demonstrated a new type of audiocassette player at the shopping mall as children and teens, including the Lyon sisters, gathered near him. A short time after Welch told this story to the mall security guard trying to cast suspicion on the other man, he was questioned at a police station, failed a lie detector test, admitted he had lied, was released and was not questioned again until more than 38 years later.\n\nDuring the reopening of the case, police discovered that a mug shot taken of Welch in 1977 bore a strong resemblance to a police sketch of a possible suspect who had been seen staring inappropriately at the Lyon sisters in the shopping mall. Detectives began interviewing Welch in prison; he made statements that further implicated him although he continued to protest his innocence. One of his relatives told them he had helped Welch burn two heavy, bloodied duffel bags in Bedford County, Virginia. In July 2015, Welch was indicted and charged with the girls' murders there; he pleaded guilty to murder two years later. His uncle is a person of interest as well.\n\nThe two sisters were born to John and Mary Lyon in Kensington, Maryland. They had an older brother, Jay, who later became a policeman. Their father, John Lyon, was a well-known radio personality at WMAL, a local radio station then held by the owner of the ABC Television affiliate in Washington and the now-defunct \"Washington Star\"; he later worked as a victims' counselor. The sisters' disappearance continued to be featured in high-profile stories in the national media for months.\n\nLocated a half-mile away from their home was Wheaton Plaza shopping mall (now Westfield Wheaton). On March 25, 1975, Katherine and Sheila Lyon walked to the mall to see the Easter exhibits. It was their spring vacation and they planned to have lunch at the Orange Bowl, which was part of the mall. They left home between 11:00 AM and noon. Their mother had instructed them to return home by 4:00 PM; when they had not arrived by 7:00 PM, the police were called and an extensive search was conducted. Police felt comfortable enough with the accuracy of this timeline to release it to the public.\n\n\nPolice were told by witnesses that the sisters were in the Wheaton Plaza mall at approximately 1 PM. A neighborhood boy, who knew the sisters, reported that he saw them together outside the Orange Bowl speaking with an unidentified man, about 6 feet tall, 50 to 60 years old, and wearing a brown suit. The man was carrying a briefcase with a tape recorder inside; there were also other children around who were speaking into a microphone he was holding. The witness's description of the man led authorities to view the unknown person as a prime suspect in the Lyon sisters' case and two composite sketches of the man were created.\n\nPolice investigating the case followed up on reports from several people who said they recognized the sketch of the unknown man with the briefcase. Press reports indicated that a man matching the sketch was seen a few weeks earlier at the Marlow Heights Shopping Center and the Iverson Mall, both in neighboring Prince George's County, Maryland. These people reported that he had approached several young girls and asked them to read an answering machine message typed on an index card into his hand-held microphone. The police never publicly acknowledged a direct link between these reports and the Lyon sisters' disappearance.\n\nAs the weeks wore on, numerous volunteer groups combed vacant lots and stream beds for the sisters. The search continued and press interest reached such a fever pitch that on May 23, 1975, Maryland Lt. Gov. Blair Lee ordered 122 National Guardsmen to participate in a search of a Montgomery County forest for the missing girls.\n\nNo trace of the girls was ever found.\n\nA new lead was discovered as of September 20, 2014. The police searched the woods of Thaxton, Virginia, and entered a house in Hyattsville, Maryland, seizing several items. These searches were relevant to the new suspect named Lloyd Welch and his relatives.\n\nOn April 7, 1975, about two weeks after their disappearance, a witness in Manassas, Virginia, reported seeing two girls resembling Sheila and Katherine in the rear of a beige 1968 Ford station wagon. The witness stated that the girls were bound and gagged in the vehicle. The driver of the station wagon resembled the man in the publicly available sketch of the prime suspect. The witness further claimed that when the driver spotted the witness tailing him, he ran a red light and sped west on Route 234 towards Interstate 66 in Virginia. The station wagon had Maryland license plates with the possible combination \"DMT-6**.\" The last two numbers are unknown due to the bending of the car's plate. The known combination was issued in Cumberland, Hagerstown, and Baltimore, Maryland at the time. This supposed sighting inspired a small army of mobile citizen band (CB) radio users to scour the area throughout the evening and into the night with a running commentary and chatter but without any tangible results. A search for matching plate numbers failed to produce any information. Although this witness's report was at first treated as credible, and a media firestorm erupted because of it, it was later deemed \"questionable\" by police. Despite its questionable nature, media continue to mention this report as credible.\n\nSeveral phone calls from people claiming to have the girls and offering to exchange them for ransom money were made to the Lyon family in the immediate aftermath of the sisters' disappearances. The one that went the furthest and that had seemed most credible began with an anonymous male voice on April 4, 1975, and demanded that John Lyon leave a briefcase with $10,000 inside an Annapolis, Maryland, courthouse restroom. The money was left just as the instructions from the caller required, but the money was never claimed. This same anonymous person called John Lyon later and maintained that police had surrounded the courthouse and he could not retrieve the ransom. The man was told that he would have to show some evidence of having the Lyon sisters in his custody before another attempt would be made to leave him a ransom. Although the caller then said he would be in touch with the family, he never contacted them again.\n\nFred Howard Coffey was convicted in 1987 for the 1979 beating, strangulation murder, and molestation of a 10-year-old girl in North Carolina and () is serving a life sentence (after an earlier death sentence was overturned) in a North Carolina prison. Authorities learned that he interviewed for a job (and was subsequently employed) in Silver Spring, Maryland, six days after the Lyon sisters vanished. Silver Spring is a short distance from Wheaton Plaza. Investigators have been unable to determine if Coffey is connected to the case, and he was never charged in the disappearances.\n\nRaymond Rudolph Mileski Sr. was another possible suspect named in press reports. Mileski resided in Suitland, Maryland, in 1975, not far from the malls in Prince George's County that had reported a man with a microphone approaching young girls. In a family disagreement, Mileski murdered his wife and teenage son and wounded another son inside their home in November 1977. He was convicted of the homicides and sentenced to 40 years in prison. Based on both prison informants' tips and Mileski's own claims to know something about the Lyon sisters case, which he offered to share more fully in exchange for more favorable prison conditions, authorities searched his former residence in April 1982, but no evidence was discovered. Mileski died in prison in 2004.\n\nJohn Brennan Crutchley had also been considered a suspect.\n\nAfter the disappearance, a friend of the Lyon sisters, a girl who was in their age bracket, described to detectives how a long-haired man at the mall had stared at the girls so long and so intently that she confronted him. A sketch artist made a drawing based on her description: white, late teens or early 20s, acne on his face, scars on his left cheek, shabbily dressed. That sketch, though, appears not to have been widely disseminated. The drawing shows similarities to a 1977 mug shot of Lloyd Welch.\n\nThe description from the sisters' friend contrasted sharply with the only description of a possible suspect that was made public in 1975, that of the well-groomed, conservatively dressed person eventually labeled \"tape recorder man.\" Aside from the strong differences in facial features, hair and clothing, the long-haired man and \"tape recorder man\" were several decades apart in age.\n\nThe day that newspapers printed a description of the conservatively dressed man carrying a briefcase with audiocassette recorder and holding a microphone, Lloyd Welch returned to Wheaton Plaza mall and told a security guard that he had been there the week before. He said he had seen a man with a tape recorder talking to two girls and later, forcing the girls into a car, according to court records. Montgomery investigators were summoned to the mall and took Welch to a nearby police station to interview him. They gave him a polygraph test. Told he had failed it, he admitted he had provided false information about witnessing the abduction and was released by police, according to documents in the case. For more than 38 years thereafter, information about Welch's possible involvement in the case was accessible only via a search of police records. The identity of the Lyon sisters' female friend who had told police about him was never published and remains confidential to this day.\n\nWelch's cousin, Henry Parker, told detectives in December 2014 that in 1975 he met Welch at a property on Taylor's Mountain Road, in Thaxton, Virginia. Parker said he helped remove two army-style duffel bags from Welch's vehicle. Each bag \"weighed about 60 or 70 pounds and smelled like 'death,'\" according to a search warrant affidavit, which was filed and sealed in January 2015. Moreover, Parker said the bags had been covered in red stains. Without knowing their contents, Parker threw the bags into a fire.\n\nIn February 2014, Welch was named as a person of interest in the case. Police said Welch, who was 18 years old in 1975, and has since been convicted of rapes in three other states, had been \"seen 'paying attention' to the sisters.\" \n\nOver a year later, in July 2015, Welch, then serving a lengthy sentence in Delaware on a child-molestation conviction, was indicted on first-degree felony murder for his alleged involvement in the deaths of Katherine and Sheila Lyon. He was also charged with abduction with intent to defile. The location of any remains of the girls' bodies is still unknown. Had Welch been brought to trial without the girls' bodies entered into evidence, it would have been the longest time to have elapsed between a murder and a trial in a bodiless murder conviction.\n\nUltimately, in September 2017, Welch pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree murder \"for the abduction and killing of Katherine and Shelia Lyon in 1975.\"\n\n\n"}

On Recalling and Forgetting is the first Holocaust-themed art exhibition in Estonia, taking place at Tartu Art Museum in early 2015, seventy years after the end of World War II and the liberation of the Nazi extermination camps. The exhibition, curated by museum's director Rael Artel, received a lot of attention from Estonian society and from both Estonian and international media. It brough out the differences of opinion and initiated a public debate about the reflection of Holocaust and freedom of speech, censorship and self-censorship in art. Originally, eight contemporary artworks were exhibited, one of them by an Estonian artist and seven from Polish artists (incl. one Polish–Israeli and one American with Polish Jewish roots). Soon after the opening of the exhibition the museum limited access to two works of art because of public criticism. Later, both of them were removed from the exhibition.\n\nThe name of the exhibition \"My Poland\" emphasizes curators personal perspective to Polish contemporary art where Holocaust and the Second World War is a distinctive theme. The name refers to a popular Estonian books series (\"My Estonia\", \"My Mexico\", \"My St. Petersburg\", etc.) which also focuses on authors' personal impressions of different countries.\n\nThe works selected for the exhibition in Tartu Art Museum are made by well-known Polish artists most of whom have participated in the Venice Biennale. Curator Rael Artel has said that although she tried to find comparable works from Estonian art, the only Holocaust themed work was John Smith's painting \"Holocaust\".\n\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a publication put together by Rael Artel and designed by Mikk Heinsoo. The exhibition was supported by The Cultural Endowment of Estonia and Estonian Ministry of Culture. \"My Poland\" is curated by the director of Tartu Art Museum Rael Artel and exhibition's coordinator is Julia Polujanenkova, museums' keeper of the contemporary art.\n\n\"My Poland\" was opened on Saturday, 7 February. On Tuesday, Tartu Art Museum announced that access to two most criticized videos was being limited. Visitors could only see those videos by stating a direct request and after being introduced to curator's written explanation. Museum's director Artel made a full apology to everyone the display offended. Estonian Ministry of Culture held a discussion which was attended by Minister of Culture Urve Tiidus and the representatives of Jewish community in Estonia. After the discussion Tiidus called the videos offending and Tartu Art Museum removed them from the exhibition entirely.\n\nAs the museum was closed on Monday and Tuesday and the videos were already removed by Wednesday afternoon, the videos in question were introduced only to a small part of exhibition visitors. Therefore, majority of people who have participated in the debate have not been familiar with the content of the videos or knew them only on the basis of clips shown in the news and on the basis of written summaries.\n\nThe removal of videos has been evaluated differently. For example, journalist Kadri Veermäe from major Estonian daily Postimees interpreted it as a censorship or self-censorship. On the other hand, Kaarel Tarand, former editor-in-chief of Estonian main cultural newspaper Sirp, did not consider this as a result of censorship. Estonian artist Kiwa regarded it as the criminalization of art.\n\nAfter videos were removed, the museum decided to use that room do present the documentation about the public discussion about the exhibition on both traditional and social media, considering the themes of censure and self-censorship.\n\n\nOn the opening day, Eesti Televisioon's news program \"Aktuaalne kaamera\" asked the chairwoman of Tartu Jewish Community Ilona Smuškina to visit the exhibition My Poland. She found it to be emotionally uncomfortable: ˮI couldn't watch the video of the gas chamber for more than three seconds. But the old man who was tortured in Auschwitz, now he is tortured by the young man who did this artwork.\" Afterwards, the chairwoman of Estonian Jewish Community, Alla Jakobson, spoke out in the media. She announced that she feels insulted, she does not consider Artur Żmijewski's videos to be art at all and insists they should be removed from the exhibition: ˮIt is unacceptable and inappropriate to exhibit videos like this in a Holocaust art exhibition.\" On 10 February, a public statement to Estonian state leaders by Estonian Jewish Community was made, saying: \"It would be unthinkable to show nudity in an exhibition dedicated to Soviet deportations from Estonia. Why is Holocaust an exception justified with the artistic freedom?\" Statement made after the opening of the exhibition found supporters by many organisations, politicians and cultural figures: Estonian member of European Parliament Urmas Paet, Foreign Minister Keit Pentus-Rosimannus, Minister of Culture Urve Tiidus, Minister of Defence Sven Mikser, former Minister of Regional Affairs Vallo Reimaa, Chairman of Estonian Parliament Eiki Nestor, former Minister of Culture Laine Randjärv, former Mayor of Tallinn Jüri Ratas, Estonian Islamic Congregation, Tartu City Council's Commission of Culture, art historian Krista Piirimäe, etc. Criticism directed to \"My Poland\" also escalated quickly in the international press, particularly in Russia and Israel. Among others, the Wiesenthal Center's director Efraim Zuroff criticized the exhibition, stating that it is not enough to remove two videos as the whole exhibition should be shut down.\n\nMain critical arguments include joking about Holocaust, mocking, lack of empathy amongst the artists and the authors of the exhibition, and the need to identify the boundaries of art. \"I think that there should be ethical boundaries of freedom of speech and freedom of expression of art that should not be prescribed by law but should be in the hearts of people,\" said Laine Randjärv. \"Organizers of the exhibition have been ignoring the principles of good practices and the principles of respecting other people and nations,\" found Jüri Ratas. \"The reaction and the triggered debate in the society leads us to ask again where are the boundaries of art,\" said Urve Tiidus.\n\nA couple of days later, first statements supporting the curator and Tartu Art Museum started to appear, mostly made by people of art and culture. The criticism was also disputed by the interview to Eesti Televisioon by the author of the most criticized videos, Artur Żmijewski, who said: \"We recall the past events and it is not a passive recalling but an active one. My purpose is not to provoke anyone. There are always those who feel provoked but it wasn't my intention.\" Among the supporters of the exhibition have been a board member of the Contemporary Art Museum of Estonia Anders Härm, artist Kiwa, artist Jaan Elken, semiotician Mihhail Lotman, artist Marko Mäetamm (the single Estonian artist represented on the exhibition), former Minister of Culture Rein Lang, journalist Kadri Veermäe, artist Marge Monko, etc.\n\nOn ETV morning show \"Terevisioon\", Sirje Helme, the director of Estonian Art Museum Kumu, commented the situation as follows: ˮThis debate can't be about whether it is art or not. The question is, how far can an artwork go in its freedom to sharply touch this or that subject. /.../ I think that there are almost no limits in democratic freedom but some things are agreed upon not to be touched, and Holocaust is certainly one of those things. So the question is not whether it is a good or bad work of art, the problem is that it has touched a subject which is declared to be taboo in Europe and America. /.../ This is a political world, not a world of art. I think this subject does not belong to the art world.\" Anders Härm responded: ˮI think that there is no such rule. There is no theme more mediated than Holocaust if we talk about the horrors during the Second World War. The work by John Smith referred to this – commercialization of Holocaust. Jean Baudrillard and Umberto Eco have also talked about how Hollywood wouldn't let Jews to forgive and Germans to be forgiven.\" Sirje Helme said: ˮFor me, this question is in black and white. I will stick to my opinion that it is not about art with its aesthetical criteria and sensitivities. The question here is that the topic is sacred and only certain people can engage in it.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11044340", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11044340", "title": "Prague Quadrennial", "text": "Prague Quadrennial\n\nThe Prague Quadrennial of Performance Design and Space was established in 1967 to bring the best of design for performance, scenography, and theatre architecture to the front line of cultural activities to be experienced by professional and emerging artists as well as the general public. The quadrennial exhibitions, festivals, and educational programs act as a global catalyst of creative progress by encouraging experimentation, networking, innovation, and future collaborations. PQ aims to honor, empower and celebrate the work of designers, artists and architects while inspiring and educating audiences, who are the most essential element of any live performance.\nThe Prague Quadrennial strives to present performance design as an art form concerned with creation of active performance environments, that are far beyond merely decorative or beautiful, but emotionally charged, where design can become a quest, a question, an argument, a threat, a resolution, an agent of change, or a provocation. Performance design is a collaborative field where designers mix, fuse and blur the lines between multiple artistic disciplines to search for new approaches and new visions.\n\nThe Prague Quadrennial organizes an expansive program of international projects and activities between the main quadrennial events – performances, exhibitions, symposia, workshops, residencies, and educational initiatives serve as an international platform for exploring the practice, theory and education of contemporary performance design in the most encompassing terms.\n\nDuring the São Paulo Art Biennial in 1959, a special exhibit, designed by František Tröster, illustrated the development of Czech and Slovak stage design and theatre architecture during the period from 1914-1959. The result of the exhibition was a gold medal for Czechoslovakia. Continued Czech success during the next three Biennales led to an offer for Prague to host an international exhibition of stage design in Europe. Since its premiere in 1967, the international exhibition has been held regularly every four years, and has come to be known as the Prague Quadrennial.\n\nImportant artists who marked the history of the theater and the scenography participated and exposed at the Prague Quadrennial, such as Salvador Dalí, Josef Svoboda, Oscar Niemeyer, Tadeusz Kantor, Guy-Claude François and Ralph Koltai, as well as figures of the contemporary theater, such as Robert Wilson, Heiner Goebbels and Renzo Piano.\n\nThe exhibitions are judged and estimated by an International Jury, attributing the following awards:\n\nThe Golden Triga was awarded in 1967 to France, in 1971 to the GDR, in 1975 to the USSR, in 1979 to Great Britain, in 1983 to the GDR, in 1987 to the USA, in 1991 to Great Britain, in 1995 to Brazil, in 1999 to the Czech Republic, in 2003 to Great Britain, in 2007 to Russia, in 2011 to Brazil and in 2015 to Estonia.\n\nAfter long 12 years PQ 2019 will take place at Prague Exhibition Grounds. The left wing of Industrial Palace, where 4 editions of PQ - 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007 - had been traditionally held, burnt down in 2008 and the next editions removed to other Prague locations. This edition of Prague Quadrennial is inspired by the Golden Triga, the statue and the main award traditionally given as the highest prize to the best exhibition. The three different forces coming together to pull the chariot driven by Nike, the goddess of victory, stand proudly on the roof of the National Theatre to remind us that everything we do in creating a performance is an act of collaboration where all talents combine their strengths to achieve much more than any individual could ever accomplish alone. The three horses pulling the chariot symbolize three stages of human life, youth's wild instinct and intuition, the experience of adulthood and the age of wisdom. We will use the metaphor of the Triga to explore three points of view, three areas connected with cyclical phases of creative process:\nImagination,Transformation and Memory.\n\nImagination\nThe first area of interest will be dedicated to the beginnings of the creative process; searches for an artistic identity, strengths of formative energy and imagination. This is the phase where the work is raw, visceral, and untamed. Together we will explore the fragile moments of nding balance between the isolated individuality and ability to share even the most extreme ideas with others. We would like to focus on projects where the leading force is intuition and instinct unlimited and unaffected by routine. We will be interested in new concepts, experiments, discoveries, utopias and records of the invisible and fantastic interior world of human imagination.\n\nTransformation\nTransformation is concerned with the core of the creative process, where artists develop strength, con dence, and the ability to discover anew within the limitations of the professional task. It is about the exciting process of surpassing the individual personality and the realization of the power of shared awareness and the collective vision of a group. In this section we will strive to inspire by looking for the best samples of outstanding collaborative performance design and architecture, where experience and deep understanding played a major role in its successful realization. The focus will be on in-depth explorations of the possibilities within the limitations of each task, where the limits determine new styles, engender new forms, and give impulse to new creation.\n\nMemory\nIn this section we will celebrate the phase in life and the creative process where all learning, gained experiences and memories merge and crystallize into a strong life philosophy and individual art form. Each era and each generation is affected by a different set of circumstances, socio-economic and political environments and moments of important changes that propel new ideas. Those moments are written into the memories of generations and become connective markers on the map of shared emotions. The best works of performance design, which only are complete during the performance, are saturated with the emotions of the era and often play an important role in the awakening of public consciousness. \nAfter the performance is over there are only fragments of design work left such as models, drawings, costumes and objects. Those fragments become capsules filled with the essence of their time, are part of important memories and help us understand the complex currents of here and now.\n\n"}

Before the genocide had begun one method used to intimidate the Armenian population was sexual humiliation. Women and young girls were not only subjected to rape, but also forced marriage, torture, forced prostitution, being sold into slavery and sexual mutilation.\n\nHeinrich Bergfeld, the German Consul to Trabzon reported \"the numerous rapes of women and girls,\" which crime he regarded as being part of a plan for \"the virtually complete extermination of the Armenians.\" The systematic use of rape during the genocide was testified to by Turkish, American, Austrian, and German witnesses and officials.\n\nIn the years between 1850 and 1870 the Patriarch of Armenia submitted 537 letters to the Sublime Porte asking for help to protect the Armenians from the violent abuse and social and political injustice they were subjected to. He requested the people be protected from \"brigandage, murder, abduction and rape of women and children, confiscatory taxes, and fraud and extortion by local officials.\"\n\nWithin the legal system the Armenian communities had their own prisons and court systems, and were able to hold civil cases for issues between Christians and Muslims. Within the Islamic judicial system the Armenians had no recourse, a Muslim was allowed to request a hearing before a religious court, in which testimony from non-Muslims would be disallowed or given little value. All a Muslim needed to do to get a case settled was swear on the Koran. Because of this the Armenians, as well as other dhimmi, had little hope within the judicial system. According to Peter Balakian, \"a well-armed Kurd or Turk could not only steal his [Armenian] host's possessions but could rape or kidnap the women and girls of the household with impunity.\" \"The amount of theft and extortion, as well as rape and abduction of Armenian women, that was allowed under this Ottoman legal system placed the Armenians in perpetual jeopardy.\"\n\nIn 1895, Frederick Davis Greene, published \"The Armenian Crisis in Turkey: The Massacre of 1894, Its Antecedents and Significance\". The book made note of the fact that men were murdered out of hand, while the women and children suffered appalling sexual attacks. In one incident he described, \n\nA lot of women, variously estimated from 60 to 160 in number, were shut up in a church, and the soldiers were \"let loose\" among them. Many were outraged to death, and the remainder dispatched with sword and bayonet. Children were placed in a row, one behind another, and a bullet fired down the line, apparently to see how many could be dispatched with one bullet. Infants and small children were piled one on the other and their heads struck off.\n\nThe genocide of 1915 was planned well in advance. A document obtained by Commander C. H. Heathcote Smith of the British Naval Volunteer Service, which was dubbed \"The Ten Commandments\" gave a detailed account of how the genocide was to be carried out.\n\nThe genocide began following the outbreak of World War I. Armenians serving in the Turkish armed forces were removed and killed. The Armenian civilian population were sent on forced marches and denied food and water. In a strategy similar to the tactics used by the German Empire in German South-West Africa, the Armenians were forced into the desert. On the line of march the women, young girls and boys were systematically raped, mutilated and tortured. Hundreds of thousands died on these forced marches.\n\nOne objective of genocidal rape is forced pregnancy; however, those unable to bear children are also subject to sexual assault. Victims ages can range from children to women in their eighties. During the Armenian Genocide the rape of young girls was well documented; they would be assaulted in their homes before forced relocation, or on the forced marches into the Syrian desert. An eyewitness testified, \"It was a very common thing for them to rape our girls in our presence. Very often they violated eight or ten year old girls, and as a consequence many would be unable to walk, and were shot.\" Another testified that every girl in her village aged over twelve, and some who were younger, had been raped.\n\nWomen were gang raped and often committed suicide afterwards. Once the men had been separated from the women, the women were systematically raped and then killed, along with any children. According to eyewitness accounts, the practice of rape was \"more or less universal\". Armenians \"were often killed in festivals of cruelty which involved rape and other forms of torture.\" The women were raped on a daily basis and were forced to work as prostitutes. Many were killed by bayoneting, or died from exposure or from prolonged sexual abuse.\n\nIn 2008, A. Dirk Moses described genocide as a \"total social practice.\" Within this context, rape can be viewed as an integral part of genocide. Genocides usually involve attacking the familial roles of the victims, which are the ways they contribute to the reproduction of the targeted group as perceived by the perpetrators. Commonalities across all genocides are the murder of infants in front of parents, forced rape of women by family members, and the violation and mutilation of the reproductive systems. The Armenian genocide is a prime example of these behaviors. The attackers follow a pattern of family based destruction. In attacks on villages men were killed, and the surviving population were raped, forcibly dislocated or killed. Another purpose of the rapes was eliticide, the destruction of a group's leadership, which was then used to create confusion. This gave a public demonstration of the mastery the attackers had over the Armenian populace, and caused `total suffering` on both sexes, as they bore witness to sexual assault and the torture of those they loved.\n\nAccording to Taner Akçam, forced prostitution, rape and sexual abuse were widespread, and military commanders told their men to \"Do to them whatever you wish\". Members of the German armed forces in Der Zor helped to open a brothel. Throughout the genocide the men were given free licence to do as they pleased with Armenian women. Armenian women and children were displayed naked in auctions in Damascus, where they were sold as sex slaves. The trafficking of Armenian women as sex slaves was an important source of income for accompanying soldiers, while in Arab areas, they were sold at low prices. The German consul at Mosul reported that the maximum price for Armenian women was \"5 piastres\".\n\nKaren Jeppe, who was working for the League of Nations in Aleppo and was attempting to have released the tens of thousands of women and children who had been abducted, said in 1926 that out of the thousands of women she had spoken to, only one had not been sexually abused.\n\nRössler, the German consul in Aleppo during the genocide, heard from an \"objective\" Armenian that around a quarter of young women, whose appearance was \"more or less pleasing\", were regularly raped by the gendarmes, and that \"even more beautiful ones\" were violated by 10-15 men. This resulted in girls and women being left behind dying, naked.\n\nFollowing the end of World War I, the British exerted pressure on the Sultan to bring to trial the leadership of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) for crimes against humanity. By April 1919 over 100 Turkish officials had been arrested.\n\nTestimony given by Nuri, the police chief of Trabzon, claimed that he had given young girls, as a gift from the governor-general to the CUP central committee. A merchant by name of Mehmed Ali testified that not only were children being killed at the Red Crescent Hospital, but that young girls were also being raped and that the governor-general held there fifteen girls for his sexual gratification. Hasan Maruf, a military officer, testified to the British that \"Government officials at Trebizond picked out some of the prettiest Armenian women of the best families. After committing the worst outrages on them, they had them killed.\"\n\nThe court found the Lieutenant governor Kemal Bey, of the district of Yozgat, guilty of murder and forced relocation; he was given the death penalty. Major Tevfik Bey, a commander of police was also found guilty and was given a 16-year prison sentence.\"\n\n"}

He served as Archbishop of Boston from 1944 to 1970 and was made a cardinal in 1958. Cushing's main role was as fundraiser and builder of new churches, schools, and institutions. He was on good terms with practically the entire Boston elite, as he softened the traditional confrontation between the Catholic Irish and the Protestant upper-class. Cushing built useful relationships with Jews, Protestants, and institutions outside the usual Catholic community. He helped presidential candidate John F. Kennedy deflect fears of papal interference in American government if a Catholic became president. Cushing's high energy level allowed him to meet with many people all day, often giving lengthy speeches at night. Cushing was not efficient at business affairs, and when expenses built up he counted on his fund-raising skills instead of cost-cutting. Cushing, says Nasaw, was \"fun-loving, informal, and outgoing. He looked rather like a tough, handsome, Irish cop and behaved more like a ward politician than a high church cleric.\" His major weakness in retrospect was overexpansion, adding new institutions that could not be sustained in the long run and had to be cut back by his successors.\n\nCushing was born in South Boston on August 24, 1895. The third of five children, he was the son of Patrick and Mary (née Dahill) Cushing. His parents were both Irish immigrants; his father was originally from Glanworth, County Cork, and his mother from Touraneena, County Waterford. His father, who came to the United States in 1880, worked as a blacksmith and earned $18 per week in the trolley repair pits of the Boston Elevated Railway.\n\nCushing received his early education at Perry Public Grammar School in the City Point section of South Boston, since there was then no parochial school for boys in Gate of Heaven Parish. Cushing dropped out of high school in his freshman year because of his compulsive truancy. He subsequently entered Boston College High School, a Jesuit college preparatory school. His tuition there was paid by his cousin, who was a priest of the Archdiocese of New York. He graduated from high school in 1913, receiving honors for Latin and Greek. Cushing was torn for a time between religion and politics. He originally wanted to be a politician, even earning money by speaking for politicians from the back of wagons. He twice considered joining the Jesuits, but came to the conclusion he \"was cut out more for the active life and not the teaching apostolate.\"\n\nHe entered Boston College in 1913, becoming a member of the first freshman class following the college's move to Chestnut Hill. At Boston College, he was active in the Marquette Debating Society and elected vice-president of his sophomore class. Following the sinking of the RMS \"Lusitania\" in 1915, Cushing enlisted in the United States Army but was medically discharged for his asthma after a few weeks. After attending Boston College for two years, he began his studies for the priesthood at St. John's Seminary in Brighton in September 1915. He was assigned to continue his studies at the Pontifical North American College in Rome, but the escalation of U-boat activity prevented him from sailing across the Atlantic.\n\nOn May 26, 1921, Cushing was ordained a priest by Cardinal William Henry O'Connell at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. His first assignment was as a curate at St. Patrick's Church in Roxbury, where he remained for two months. He was afterwards transferred to St. Benedict's Church in Somerville. In 1922, Cushing appeared unannounced at the residence of Cardinal O'Connell to request an assignment as a missionary. The young priest declared he wanted to \"take heaven by storm.\" O'Connell denied his request, and instead appointed him assistant director of the Boston office of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, an organization dedicated to raising funds for missions. He later served as director of the Society from 1929 to 1944. He was raised to the rank of Monsignor on May 14, 1939.\n\nOn June 10, 1939, after Bishop Francis Spellman was named Archbishop of New York, Cushing was appointed auxiliary bishop of Boston and titular bishop of \"Mela\" by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following June 29 from Cardinal O'Connell, with Bishops John Bertram Peterson and Thomas Addis Emmet, SJ, serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. He took as his episcopal motto: \"Ut Cognoscant Te\" (Latin: \"That they may know thee\").\n\nAs an auxiliary bishop, Cushing continued to serve as director of the Society for the Propagation of Faith, and was also named pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Newton Centre. Following the death of Cardinal O'Connell in April 1944, he served as apostolic administrator of the archdiocese.\n\nCushing was named the third Archbishop of Boston on September 25, 1944, following Cardinal O'Connell's death. During his tenure, Boston would see the excommunication of Fr. Leonard Feeney for his stringent interpretation of the Catholic doctrine that there is no salvation outside the Church. Feeney refused to back down from his position, although it has been reported that he was ultimately reconciled with the church before his death.\n\nAfter the death of Pius XII, Cushing published a moving tribute to him. In 1959, Cushing published a biography of the late Pope Pius XII (1939–1958), depicting the late pope as \"Pope of Peace\".\n\nHis work contributed to making the Roman Catholic Church acceptable to the general American population at the time of then-Senator John F. Kennedy's run for the White House. Part of this work included reaching out to the non-Catholics of Boston after \"the muscular style of involved Catholicism that Cardinal O'Connell brought to bear on issues of his day religious, social, and political in Boston and Massachusetts\".\n\nCushing was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Susanna by Pope John XXIII in the consistory of December 15, 1958. He was one of the cardinal electors in the 1963 papal conclave, which elected Pope Paul VI.\n\nThe Cardinal was a close friend of the Kennedy family. He officiated at the marriage of John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Lee Bouvier in 1953, at which he also read a special prayer from Pope Pius XII, and baptized many of the Kennedy children. Cushing gave the prayer invocation at Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. The Cardinal also celebrated President Kennedy's funeral Mass in 1963 at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe day before the funeral, he gave a televised eulogy for the President. Cushing later defended Jacqueline Kennedy after her marriage to Aristotle Onassis in 1968. He received a large amount of hate mail and was contradicted by the Vatican.\n\nIn 1959, Cardinal Cushing published his only book, a biography of the late Pope Pius XII (1939–1958). It is an almost hagiographic biography, written shortly after the death of the Pontiff. Cushing depicted him as the \"Pope of Peace\", who, armed only with the spiritual weapons of his office, triumphed over insidious attacks that seemed about to destroy the center of Christendom.\n\nAt the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) Cushing played a vital role in drafting \"Nostra aetate\", the document that officially absolved the Jews of deicide charge. His emotional comments during debates over the drafts were echoed in the final version:\n\nHe was deeply committed to implementing the Council's reforms and promoting renewal in the Church. In an unprecedented gesture of ecumenism, he encouraged Catholics to attend Billy Graham's crusades. Cushing strongly condemned Communism, particularly the regime of Josip Broz Tito in Yugoslavia.\n\nCushing's resignation as Boston's archbishop was accepted on September 8, 1970. Upon his resignation, Senator Ted Kennedy stated: \"For three-quarters of a century [Cushing's] life has been a light in a world that cries out for illumination. He will never have to account for his stewardship, for if his goodness is not known to God, no one's ever will be.\"\n\nLess than two months later, he died from cancer in Boston at the age of 75 on the feast of All Souls Day, and was buried in Hanover, Massachusetts at the Portiuncula Chapel on the grounds of the Cardinal Cushing Centers.\n\n\n\nThis is an incomplete list of the various writings of Richard Cardinal Cushing.\n\n\nArticles\n\n\nWorks on Richard Cardinal Cushing\n\n\n\n"}

In addition to his payment from the festival organizers, the \"kynopou\" was to receive welcome gifts \"(xenia)\" from people along the processional route, perhaps to obtain reciprocal hospitality in the afterlife.

{"id": "36417116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36417116", "title": "The Chickens and the Bulls", "text": "The Chickens and the Bulls\n\nThe Chickens and the Bulls (called 'Operation Homex' by the FBI) refers to an extortion ring that preyed on prominent, closeted, gay men in the 1960s. Corrupt police officers and police impersonators known as 'Bulls' , used young often underage men called 'chickens' to blackmail wealthy or important closeted men across the country. Over nearly a decade the ring victimized thousands, including \" a navy admiral, two generals, a U.S. congressman, a prominent surgeon, an Ivy League professor, a prep school headmaster, and several well-known actors, singers, and television personalities\" This went on until 1966 when Manhattan DA Frank Hogan announced that the ring had been broken up, after \"at least 2 million dollars had been taken.\"\n\nThe ring consisted of small groups of chickens and bulls. The chickens were young male prostitutes who waited outside bars to be approached, or in some cases identified potential marks and seduced them. After making contact, they would accompany the mark to a hotel room and get him into a compromising position while waiting for their partners to arrive.\n\nThe bulls would then burst into the room wearing full police gear, sometimes even with authentic badges, and explain the penalties for violating sodomy laws or corrupting a minor. The extortionists would then demand payment, either as a bribe or as \"bail\" to avoid making the arrest public.\n\nAlternatively, the chickens could merely rob their marks, keeping any money and passing the mark's personal information on to the extortionists who would then determine whether or not that person was worth further attention. Those who were would then be approached by a police impersonator, using the mark's ID as proof that he had been involved in homosexual activities, and told that they would have to pay to keep their homosexuality secret.\n\nSometimes, rather than threatening marks, the extortionists would tell them that they had to testify in court about a prostitution ring, but that if they paid \"bail money,\" someone else could be released to testify instead. When dealing with high profile targets, this method was often more effective than attempting to bully them.\n\nThe official investigation of the extortion ring began with a few scattered reports of police impersonation and a handful of anonymous letters regarding homosexual extortion. As the NYPD division devoted to organized crime activity was connecting these incidents, one specific arrest revealed the true scope of the ring. Detailed in William McGowan's article on the subject:\n\n\"July 1965, Detective 3rd Grade James McDonnell received a call in the upstairs squad room of midtown Manhattan's 17th Precinct. There was a man at the Western Union office in Grand Central Station who might be impersonating a police detective, he was told. The man was in the company of a 14-year-old runaway and had contacted the boy's father in Texas to wire plane fare so the son could fly home.The father had grown suspicious when the man had asked for $150—twice the needed amount.\"\n\nThe man McDonnell met in that Western Union office appeared to be a NYPD member, but a quick conversation with him revealed that the man, John Aitken, had an arrest record and had been trying to use the boy in a robbery scheme. Aitken's subsequent interrogation revealed that \"he had knowledge of an extortion ring that had shaken down dozens of prominent closeted homosexual men across the country—most of them married and with families.\"\n\nThe amount of effort that the police put into this investigation was rare for any crimes involving homosexuals as the police force as a whole was rather homophobic in the 1960s. Homosexuality was still illegal in most states, but in this case the police set aside their own prejudices, most likely because of the involvement of police impersonators.\n\nThere were three main ringleaders financing and overseeing operations across the country:\nJohn Pyne, a Chicago police department member who learned about blackmail from those he arrested. Sherman Chadwick Kaminsky and Elwood Lee Hammock were the final ringleaders and were the primary extortionists, responsible for the legwork and day-to-day operations.\n\nIn his 50's at the time of the extortion ring, John J. Pyne worked for the Chicago Police Department as a member of their Confidential Squad, responsible for dealing with cases of blackmail and other racketeering.1 In the mid 1960s, Pyne was on sick leave on and off over a period of 2–3 years. During this time he was responsible for furnishing the extortionists with fake police badges, warrants, travel money, and attorneys among other things. Additionally he was responsible for finding potential high profile targets. In short, He was the primary overseer of the operation and masterminded the extortion ring.\n\nSherman Chadwick Kaminsky and Elwood Lee Hammock were Pyne's chief extortionists. Once caught, they revealed the full scope of the operation and helped the FBI take down Pyne. In an interview, Paul Brana, an FBI agent who worked on the case, spoke about the arrests. \"Once that Kaminsky was arrested by me the second time, he became extensively cooperative. He was telling me about all of the extortions that he had committed in the United States.\" This led to Pyne receiving multiple prison sentences totaling ten years.\n\nThere were thousands of victims, but a large number of these were merely targets of opportunity. Additionally, very few victims came forward on their own, and only a small number of these people were willing to sign formal complaints. Names of victims came primarily from extortionists arrested by police, and many of these victims denied it due to the fear that the extortionists would make good on their threats, either to out the victims, or to go after their families. In many cases, the victims believed that they had been targeted by actual police officers, further discouraging them from coming forward.\n\nAmong those confirmed, high-profile, victims were New Jersey congressman Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., and Admiral William Church, among several other government officials, a prominent surgeon, and a famous British producer.\n"}
{"id": "30059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30059", "title": "Troy", "text": "Troy\n\nTroy (, \"Troia\" or Τροίας, \"Troias\" and , \"Ilion\" or , \"Ilios\"; and ; Hittite: \"Wilusha\" or \"Truwisha\"; ) was a city in the far northwest of the region known in late Classical antiquity as Asia Minor, now known as Anatolia in modern Turkey, just south of the southwest mouth of the Dardanelles strait and northwest of Mount Ida. The present-day location is known as Hisarlik. It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle, in particular in the \"Iliad\", one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Metrical evidence from the \"Iliad\" and the \"Odyssey\" suggests that the name (\"Ilion\") formerly began with a digamma: (\"Wilion\"); this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city, Wilusa.\n\nA new capital called Ilium (from Greek: Ἴλιον, \"Ilion\") was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus. It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople, became a bishopric and declined gradually in the Byzantine era, but is now a Latin Catholic titular see.\n\nIn 1865, English archaeologist Frank Calvert excavated trial trenches in a field he had bought from a local farmer at Hisarlik, and in 1868, Heinrich Schliemann, a wealthy German businessman and archaeologist, also began excavating in the area after a chance meeting with Calvert in Çanakkale. These excavations revealed several cities built in succession. Schliemann was at first skeptical about the identification of Hisarlik with Troy, but was persuaded by Calvert and took over Calvert's excavations on the eastern half of the Hisarlik site, which was on Calvert's property. Troy VII has been identified with the city called Wilusa by the Hittites (the probable origin of the Greek Ἴλιον) and is generally (but not conclusively) identified with Homeric Troy.\n\nToday, the hill at Hisarlik has given its name to a small village near the ruins, which supports the tourist trade visiting the Troia archaeological site. It lies within the province of Çanakkale, some 30 km south-west of the provincial capital, also called Çanakkale. The nearest village is Tevfikiye. The map here shows the adapted Scamander estuary with Ilium a little way inland across the Homeric plain. Due to Troy's location near the Aegean Sea, the Sea of Marmara, and the Black Sea, it was a central hub for the military and trade.\n\nTroy was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998.\n\nAncient Greek historians variously placed the Trojan War in the 12th, 13th, or 14th centuries BC: Eratosthenes to 1184 BC, Herodotus to 1250 BC, and Duris of Samos to 1334 BC. Modern archaeologists associate Homeric Troy with archaeological Troy VII.\n\nIn the \"Iliad\", the Achaeans set up their camp near the mouth of the River Scamander (presumably modern Karamenderes), where they had beached their ships. The city of Troy itself stood on a hill, across the plain of Scamander, where the battles of the Trojan War took place. The site of the ancient city is some 5 km from the coast today, but 3,000 years ago the mouths of Scamander were much closer to the city, discharging into a large bay that formed a natural harbor, which has since been filled with alluvial material. Recent geological findings have permitted the identification of the ancient Trojan coastline, and the results largely confirm the accuracy of the Homeric geography of Troy.\n\nIn November 2001, the geologist John C. Kraft from the University of Delaware and the classicist John V. Luce from Trinity College, Dublin, presented the results of investigations, begun in 1977, into the geology of the region. They compared the present geology with the landscapes and coastal features described in the \"Iliad\" and other classical sources, notably Strabo's \"Geographia\", and concluded that there is a regular consistency between the location of Schliemann's Troy and other locations such as the Greek camp, the geological evidence, descriptions of the topography and accounts of the battle in the \"Iliad\".\n\nBesides the \"Iliad\", there are references to Troy in the other major work attributed to Homer, the \"Odyssey\", as well as in other ancient Greek literature (such as Aeschylus's Oresteia). The Homeric legend of Troy was elaborated by the Roman poet Virgil in his \"Aeneid\". The Greeks and Romans took for a fact the historicity of the Trojan War and the identity of Homeric Troy with the site in Anatolia. Alexander the Great, for example, visited the site in 334 BC and there made sacrifices at tombs associated with the Homeric heroes Achilles and Patroclus.\n\nAfter the 1995 find of a Luwian biconvex seal at Troy VII, there has been a heated discussion over the language that was spoken in Homeric Troy. Frank Starke of the University of Tübingen recently demonstrated that the name of Priam, king of Troy at the time of the Trojan War, is connected to the Luwian compound \"Priimuua\", which means \"exceptionally courageous\". \"The certainty is growing that Wilusa/Troy belonged to the greater Luwian-speaking community,\" although it is not entirely clear whether Luwian was primarily the official language or in daily colloquial use.\n\nWith the rise of critical history, Troy and the Trojan War were, for a long time, consigned to the realms of legend. However, the true location of ancient Troy had from classical times remained the subject of interest and speculation.\n\nThe Troad peninsula was anticipated to be the location. Early modern travellers in the 16th and 17th centuries, including Pierre Belon and Pietro Della Valle, had identified Troy with Alexandria Troas, a ruined town approximately 20 km south of the currently accepted location. In the late 18th century, Jean Baptiste LeChevalier had identified a location near the village of as the site of Troy, a mound approximately 5 km south of the currently accepted location. LeChavalier's location, published in his \"Voyage de la Troade\", was the most commonly accepted theory for almost a century.\n\nIn 1822, the Scottish journalist Charles Maclaren was the first to identify with confidence the position of the city as it is now known.\n\nIn 1866, Frank Calvert, the brother of the United States' consular agent in the region, made extensive surveys and published in scholarly journals his identification of the hill of New Ilium (which was on farmland owned by his family) on the same site. The hill, near the city of Çanakkale, was known as Hisarlik.\n\nIn 1868, German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann visited Calvert and secured permission to excavate Hisarlik. In 1871–73 and 1878–79, he excavated the hill and discovered the ruins of a series of ancient cities dating from the Bronze Age to the Roman period. Schliemann declared one of these cities—at first Troy I, later Troy II—to be the city of Troy, and this identification was widely accepted at that time. Schliemann's finds at Hisarlik have become known as Priam's Treasure. They were acquired from him by the Berlin museums, but significant doubts about their authenticity persist.\nSchliemann became interested in digging at the mound of Hisarlik at the persuasion of Frank Calvert. The British diplomat, considered a pioneer for the contributions he made to the archaeology of Troy, spent more than 60 years in the Troad (modern day Biga peninsula, Turkey) conducting field work. As Calvert was a principal authority on field archaeology in the region, his findings supplied evidence that Homeric Troy might exist in the hill, and played a major role in directing Heinrich Schliemann to dig at the Hisarlik. However, Schliemann downplayed his collaboration with Calvert when taking credit for the findings, such that Susan Heuek Allen recently described Schliemann as a \"relentlessly self-promoting amateur archaeologist\".\n\nSchliemann's excavations were condemned by later archaeologists as having destroyed the main layers of the real Troy. Kenneth W. Harl in the Teaching Company's \"Great Ancient Civilizations of Asia Minor\" lecture series sarcastically claims that Schliemann's excavations were carried out with such rough methods that he did to Troy what the Greeks couldn't do in their times, destroying and levelling down the entire city walls to the ground. Other scholars agree that the damage caused to the site is irreparable. Although his work is largely rejected, his recorded findings and artifacts added knowledge regarding ancient Western history.\n\nAfter Schliemann, the site was further excavated under the direction of Wilhelm Dörpfeld and later Carl Blegen (1932–38).\n\nThese excavations have shown that there were at least nine cities built, one on top of the other, at this site. In his research, Blegen came to a conclusion that Troy's nine levels could be further divided into forty-six sublevels .\n\nIn 1988, excavations were resumed by a team from the University of Tübingen and the University of Cincinnati under the direction of Professor Manfred Korfmann, with Professor Brian Rose overseeing Post-Bronze Age (Greek, Roman, Byzantine) excavation along the coast of the Aegean Sea at the Bay of Troy. Possible evidence of a battle was found in the form of bronze arrowheads and fire-damaged human remains buried in layers dated to the early 12th century BC. The question of Troy's status in the Bronze-Age world has been the subject of a sometimes acerbic debate between Korfmann and the Tübingen historian Frank Kolb in 2001–2002.\n\nIn August 1993, following a magnetic imaging survey of the fields below the fort, a deep ditch was located and excavated among the ruins of a later Greek and Roman city. Remains found in the ditch were dated to the late Bronze Age, the alleged time of Homeric Troy. It is claimed by Korfmann that the ditch may have once marked the outer defences of a much larger city than had previously been suspected. The latter city has been dated by his team to about 1250 BC, and it has been also suggested — based on recent archeological evidence uncovered by Professor Manfred Korfmann's team — that this was indeed the Homeric city of Troy.\n\nThe archaeological site of Troy was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 1998.\n\nIn summer 2006, the excavations continued under the direction of Korfmann's colleague Ernst Pernicka, with a new digging permit.\n\nIn 2013, an international team made up of cross-disciplinary experts led by William Aylward, an archaeologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was to carry out new excavations. This activity was to be conducted under the auspices of Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University and was to use the new technique of \"molecular archaeology\". A few days before the Wisconsin team was to leave, Turkey cancelled about 100 excavation permits, including Wisconsin's.\n\nIn March 2014, it was announced that a new excavation would take place to be sponsored by a private company and carried out by Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University. This will be the first Turkish team to excavate and is planned as a 12-month excavation led by associate professor Rüstem Aslan. The University's rector stated that \"Pieces unearthed in Troy will contribute to Çanakkale’s culture and tourism. Maybe it will become one of Turkey’s most important frequented historical places.”\n\nThe walls of Troy, first erected in the Bronze Age between 3000 and 2600 BC, are its main defense. The remains of the walls have been studied through the aforementioned excavations that shed light onto the historical city itself and the mythological implications as the walls protected the citadel during the Trojan War. The fortifications display the importance of defense to the Trojans and how warfare is a prominent issue for ancient cities.\n\nThe walls surround the city, extending for several hundred meters, and at the time they were built they were over 17 feet tall. They were made of limestone, with watchtowers and brick ramparts, or elevated mounds that served as protective barriers. Throughout all of the phases, the walls served as the largest fortification to protect the Trojans against their enemies. Defense mechanisms like the walls of Troy shed light on the larger topic of warfare in ancient times, which was a significant issue in Ancient Greece and in nearby locations such as Asia Minor.\n\nWhen Troy was destroyed each time, the citizens would build upon the previous settlement, causing the layers to pile on top of one another. The layers of ruins in the citadel at Hisarlik are numbered Troy ITroy IX, with various subdivisions:\n\n\nThe first city on the site was founded in the 3rd millennium BC. During the Bronze Age, the site seems to have been a flourishing mercantile city, since its location allowed for complete control of the Dardanelles, through which every merchant ship from the Aegean Sea heading for the Black Sea had to pass. Around 1900 BC a mass migration was set off by the Hittites to the east. Cities to the east of Troy were destroyed, and although Troy was not burned, the next period shows a change of culture indicating a new people had taken over Troy. The first phase of the city is characterized by a smaller citadel, around 300 ft in diameter, with 20 rectangular houses surrounded by massive walls, towers, and gateways. Troy II doubled in size and had a lower town and the upper citadel, with the walls protecting the upper acropolis which housed the megaron-style palace for the king. The second phase was destroyed by a large fire, but the Trojans rebuilt, creating a fortified citadel larger than Troy II, but which had smaller and more condensed houses, suggesting an economic decline. This trend of making a larger circuit, or extent of the walls, continued with each rebuild, for Troy III, IV, and V. Therefore, even in the face of economic troubles, the walls remained as elaborate as before, indicating their focus on defense and protection.\n\nWhen Schliemann came across Troy II, in 1871, he believed he had found Homer's city. Schliemann and his team unearthed a large feature he dubbed the Scaean Gate, a western gate unlike the three previously found leading to the Pergamos. This gate, as he describes, was the gate that Homer had featured. As Schliemann states in his publication \"Troja\":\n\"I have proved that in a remote antiquity there was in the plain of Troy a large city, destroyed of old by a fearful catastrophe, which had on the hill of Hisarlık only its Acropolis with its temples and a few other large edifices, southerly, and westerly direction on the site of the later Ilium; and that, consequently, this city answers perfectly to the Homeric description of the sacred site of Ilios.\"\n\nTroy VI was destroyed around 1250 BC, probably by an earthquake. Only a single arrowhead was found in this layer, and no remains of bodies. However, the town quickly recovered and was rebuilt in a layout that was more orderly. This rebuild continued the trend of having a heavily fortified citadel to preserve the outer rim of the city in the face of earthquakes and sieges of the central city.\n\nTroy VIIa, which has been dated to the mid-to-late-13th century BC, is the most often cited candidate for the Troy of Homer. Troy VIIa appears to have been destroyed by war. The evidence of fire and slaughter around 1184 BC, which brought Troy VIIa to a close, led to this phase being identified with the city besieged by the Greeks during the Trojan War. This was immortalized in the \"Iliad\" written by Homer.\n\nInitially, the layers of Troy VI and VII were overlooked entirely, because Schliemann favoured the burnt city of Troy II. It was not until the need to close \"Calvert's Thousand Year Gap\" arose—from Dörpfeld's discovery of Troy VI—that archaeology turned away from Schliemann's Troy and began working towards finding Homeric Troy once more.\n\n\"Calvert's Thousand Year Gap\" (1800–800 BC) was a period not accounted for by Schliemann's archaeology and thus constituted a hole in the Trojan timeline. In Homer's description of the city, a section of one side of the wall is said to be weaker than the rest. During his excavation of more than three hundred yards of the wall, Dörpfeld came across a section very closely resembling the Homeric description of the weaker section. Dörpfeld was convinced he had found the walls of Homer's city, and now he would excavate the city itself. Within the walls of this stratum (Troy VI), much Mycenaean pottery dating from Late Helladic (LH) periods III A and III B (1400–1200 BC) was uncovered, suggesting a relation between the Trojans and Mycenaeans. The great tower along the walls seemed likely to be the \"Great Tower of Ilios\".\n\nThe evidence seemed to indicate that Dörpfeld had stumbled upon Ilios, the city of Homer's epics. Schliemann himself had conceded that Troy VI was more likely to be the Homeric city, but he never published anything stating so. The only counter-argument, confirmed initially by Dörpfeld (who was as passionate as Schliemann about finding Troy), was that the city appeared to have been destroyed by an earthquake, not by men. There was little doubt that this was the Troy of which the Mycenaeans would have known.\n\nIn 480 BC, the Persian king Xerxes sacrificed 1,000 cattle at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias while marching through the Hellespontine region towards Greece. Following the Persian defeat in 480–479, Ilion and its territory became part of the continental possessions of Mytilene and remained under Mytilenaean control until the unsuccessful Mytilenean revolt in 428–427. Athens liberated the so-called Actaean cities including Ilion and enrolled these communities in the Delian League. Athenian influence in the Hellespont waned following the oligarchic coup of 411, and in that year the Spartan general Mindaros emulated Xerxes by likewise sacrificing to Athena Ilias. From c. 410–399, Ilion was within the sphere of influence of the local dynasts at Lampsacus (Zenis, his wife Mania, and the usurper Meidias) who administered the region on behalf of the Persian satrap Pharnabazus.\n\nIn 399, the Spartan general Dercylidas expelled the Greek garrison at Ilion who were controlling the city on behalf of the Lampsacene dynasts during a campaign which rolled back Persian influence throughout the Troad. Ilion remained outside the control of the Persian satrapal administration at Dascylium until the Peace of Antalcidas in 387–386. In this period of renewed Persian control c. 387–367, a statue of Ariobarzanes, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, was erected in front of the temple of Athena Ilias. In 360–359 the city was briefly controlled by Charidemus of Oreus, a Euboean mercenary leader who occasionally worked for the Athenians. In 359, he was expelled by the Athenian Menelaos son of Arrabaios, whom the Ilians honoured with a grant of proxeny—this is recorded in the earliest civic decree to survive from Ilion. In May 334 Alexander the Great crossed the Hellespont and came to the city, where he visited the temple of Athena Ilias, made sacrifices at the tombs of the Homeric heroes, and made the city free and exempt from taxes. According to the so-called 'Last Plans' of Alexander which became known after his death in June 323, he had planned to rebuild the temple of Athena Ilias on a scale that would have surpassed every other temple in the known world.\n\nAntigonus Monophthalmus took control of the Troad in 311 and created the new city of Antigoneia Troas which was a synoikism of the cities of Skepsis, Kebren, Neandreia, Hamaxitos, Larisa, and Kolonai. In c. 311–306 the \"koinon \"of Athena Ilias was founded from the remaining cities in the Troad and along the Asian coast of the Dardanelles and soon after succeeded in securing a guarantee from Antigonus that he would respect their autonomy and freedom (he had not respected the autonomy of the cities which were synoikized to create Antigoneia). The \"koinon \"continued to function until at least the 1st century AD and primarily consisted of cities from the Troad, although for a time in the second half of the 3rd century it also included Myrlea and Chalcedon from the eastern Propontis. The governing body of the \"koinon \"was the \"synedrion\" on which each city was represented by two delegates. The day-to-day running of the \"synedrion\", especially in relation to its finances, was left to a college of five \"agonothetai\", on which no city ever had more than one representative. This system of equal (rather than proportional) representation ensured that no one city could politically dominate the \"koinon\". The primary purpose of the \"koinon \"was to organize the annual Panathenaia festival which was held at the sanctuary of Athena Ilias. The festival brought huge numbers of pilgrims to Ilion for the duration of the festival as well as creating an enormous market (the \"panegyris\") which attracted traders from across the region. In addition, the \"koinon \"financed new building projects at Ilion, for example a new theatre c. 306 and the expansion of the sanctuary and temple of Athena Ilias in the 3rd century, in order to make the city a suitable venue for such a large festival.\n\nIn the period 302–281, Ilion and the Troad were part of the kingdom of Lysimachus, who during this time helped Ilion synoikize several nearby communities, thus expanding the city's population and territory. Lysimachus was defeated at the Battle of Corupedium in February 281 by Seleucus I Nikator, thus handing the Seleucid kingdom control of Asia Minor, and in August or September of 281 when Seleucus passed through the Troad on his way to Lysimachia in the nearby Thracian Chersonese Ilion passed a decree in honour of him, indicating the city's new loyalties. In September Seleucus was assassinated at Lysimachia by Ptolemy Keraunos, making his successor, Antiochus I Soter, the new king. In 280 or soon after Ilion passed a long decree lavishly honouring Antiochus in order to cement their relationship with him. During this period Ilion still lacked proper city walls except for the crumbling Troy VI fortifications around the citadel, and in 278 during the Gallic invasion the city was easily sacked. Ilion enjoyed a close relationship with Antiochus for the rest of his reign: for example, in 274 Antiochus granted land to his friend Aristodikides of Assos which for tax purposes was to be attached to the territory of Ilion, and c. 275–269 Ilion passed a decree in honour of Metrodoros of Amphipolis who had successfully treated the king for a wound he received in battle.\n\nThe city was destroyed by Sulla's rival, the Roman general Fimbria, in 85 BC following an eleven-day siege. Later that year when Sulla had defeated Fimbria he bestowed benefactions on Ilion for its loyalty which helped with the city's rebuilding. Ilion reciprocated this act of generosity by instituting a new civic calendar which took 85 BC as its first year. However, the city remained in financial distress for several decades, despite its favoured status with Rome. In the 80s BC, Roman \"publicani\" illegally levied taxes on the sacred estates of Athena Ilias and the city was required to call on L. Julius Caesar for restitution; while in 80 BC, the city suffered an attack by pirates. In 77 BC the costs of running the annual festival of the \"koinon\" of Athena Ilias became too pressing for both Ilion and the other members of the \"koinon\" and L. Julius Caesar was once again required to arbitrate, this time reforming the festival so that it would be less of a financial burden. In 74 BC the Ilians once again demonstrated their loyalty to Rome by siding with the Roman general Lucullus against Mithridates VI. Following the final defeat of Mithridates in 63–62, Pompey rewarded the city's loyalty by becoming the benefactor of Ilion and patron of Athena Ilias. In 48 BC, Julius Caesar likewise bestowed benefactions on the city, recalling the city's loyalty during the Mithridatic Wars, the city's connection with his cousin L. Julius Caesar, and the family's claim that they were ultimately descended from Venus through the Trojan prince Aeneas and therefore shared kinship with the Ilians.\n\nIn 20 BC, the Emperor Augustus visited Ilion and stayed in the house of a leading citizen, Melanippides son of Euthydikos. As a result of his visit, he also financed the restoration and rebuilding of the sanctuary of Athena Ilias, the bouleuterion (council house) and the theatre. Soon after work on the theatre was completed in 12–11 BC, Melanippides dedicated a statue of Augustus in the theatre to record this benefaction.\n\nA new city called Ilium (from Greek Ilion) was founded on the site in the reign of the Roman Emperor Augustus. It flourished until the establishment of Constantinople, became a bishopric in the Roman province Hellespontus (civil Diocese of Asia), but declined gradually in the Byzantine era\n\nNo later than the 4th century, it was a suffragan of the provincial capital's Metropolitan Archdiocese of Cyzicus, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\nSeveral bishops are historically documented:\n\nThe diocese was nominally restored no later than 1926 as Latin Titular bishopric of Ilium (Latin) / Ilio (Curiate Italian) / Ilien(sis) (Latin adjective).\n\nIt is vacant for decades, having had the following incumbents, so far of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank :\n\nA small minority of contemporary writers argue that Homeric Troy was not at the Hisarlik site, but elsewhere in Anatolia or outside it—e.g. in England, Pergamum, Scandinavia, or Herzegovina. These proposals have not been accepted by mainstream scholarship.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Swiss scholar Emil Forrer claimed that the placenames Wilusa and Taruisa found in Hittite texts should be identified with Ilion and Troia, respectively. He further noted that the name of Alaksandu, a king of Wilusa mentioned in a Hittite treaty, is quite similar to Homer's Paris, whose birthname was Alexandros. Subsequent to this, the Tawagalawa letter (CTH 181) was found to document an unnamed Hittite king's correspondence to the king of the Ahhiyawa, referring to an earlier \"Wilusa episode\" involving hostility on the part of the Ahhiyawa. The Hittite king was long held to be Mursili II (c. 1321–1296), but, since the 1980s, his son Hattusili III (1265–1240) is commonly preferred, although his other son Muwatalli (c. 1296–1272) remains a possibility.\n\nInscriptions of the New Kingdom of Egypt also record a nation T-R-S as one of the Sea Peoples who attacked Egypt during the XIX and XX Dynasties. An inscription at Deir el-Medina records a victory of Ramesses III over the Sea Peoples, including one named \"Tursha\" (Egyptian: [\"twrš3\"]). It is probably the same as the earlier \"Teresh\" (Egyptian: [\"trš.w\"]) on the stele commemorating Merneptah's victory in a Libyan campaign around 1220 BC.\n\nThese identifications were rejected by many scholars as being improbable or at least unprovable. However, Trevor Bryce championed them in his 1998 book \"The Kingdom of the Hittites\", citing a piece of the Manapa-Tarhunda letter referring to the kingdom of Wilusa as beyond the land of the Seha River (the classical Caicus and modern Bakırçay) and near the land of \"Lazpa\" (Lesbos). Recent evidence also adds weight to the theory that Wilusa is identical to archaeological Troy. Hittite texts mention a water tunnel at Wilusa, and a water tunnel excavated by Korfmann, previously thought to be Roman, has been dated to around 2600 BC. The identifications of Wilusa with Troy and of the Ahhiyawa with Homer's Achaeans remain somewhat controversial but gained enough popularity during the 1990s to be considered majority opinion. That agrees with metrical evidence in the Iliad that the name ᾽Ιλιον (Ilion) for Troy was formerly Ϝιλιον (Wilion) with a digamma.\n\nSuch was the fame of the Epic Cycle in Roman and Medieval times that it was built upon to provide a starting point for various founding myths of national origins. The most influential, Virgil's \"Aeneid\", traces the journeys of the Trojan prince Aeneas, supposed ancestor of the founders of Rome and the Julio-Claudian dynasty. In a later era, the heroes of Troy, both those noted in Homer and those invented for the purpose, often continued to appear in the origin stories of the nations of Early Medieval Europe. The \"Roman de Troie\" was common cultural ground for European dynasties, as a Trojan pedigree was both gloriously ancient and established an equality with the ruling class of Rome. A Trojan pedigree could justify the occupation of parts of Rome's former territories.\n\nOn that basis, the Franks filled the lacunae of their legendary origins with Trojan and pseudo-Trojan names: in Fredegar's 7th-century chronicle of Frankish history, Priam appears as the first king of the Franks. The Trojan origin of France was such an established article of faith that in 1714, the learned Nicolas Fréret was Bastilled for showing through historical criticism that the Franks had been Germanic, a sore point counter to Valois and Bourbon propaganda.\n\nIn similar manner, Geoffrey of Monmouth reworked earlier material such as the \"Historia Brittonum\" to trace the legendary kings of the Britons from a supposed descendant of Aeneas called Brutus.\n\nLikewise, Snorri Sturluson, in the prologue to his Icelandic \"Prose Edda\", traced the genealogy of the ancestral figures in Norse mythology to characters appearing at Troy in Homer's epic, notably making Thor to be the son of Memnon. Sturluson referred to these figures as having made a journey across Europe towards Scandinavia, setting up kingdoms as they went.\n\n\nBibliography – Works cited\n\n"}

The song \"Veronica\" was co-produced by T-Bone Burnett and Kevin Killen, and features Paul McCartney on his iconic Höfner bass. In 2004, \"Entertainment Weekly\" voted it one of Costello's top ten greatest tunes.\n\nThe song focuses on an older woman who has experienced severe memory loss. Costello's inspiration for this song was his grandmother, who suffered from Alzheimer's. When talking about the song on a VH1 interview, Costello reminisced about his grandmother having \"terrifying moments of lucidity\" and how this was the inspiration for \"Veronica\". In his 2015 autobiography, \"Unfaithful Music & Disappearing Ink\", Costello wrote of his collaboration with McCartney, \"I'd brought an early version of \"Veronica\" that you would have recognized […] All the words I'd already written were about my paternal grandmother, Molly, or more formally, Mabel Josephine Jackson. In fact, her Catholic confirmation name, Veronica, provided the very title of the song\".\n\n\"Veronica\" was also Costello's highest-charting Top 40 hit in the United States, peaking at No. 19 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart, No. 1 on its Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, and No. 10 on its Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\n\"Veronica\" and its accompanying video depicts an aged woman, probably nearing the end of her life in a retirement home, engaging in detached reminiscences from her life from young girl to young womanhood (played by Zoe Carides). The video for \"Veronica\" featured Costello delivering a spoken-word monologue to the camera, and occasionally singing the song softly over the original vocal track from the recording. The video, co-directed by John Hillcoat and Evan English, earned an MTV Video Music Award for Best Male Video.\n\n\n"}
