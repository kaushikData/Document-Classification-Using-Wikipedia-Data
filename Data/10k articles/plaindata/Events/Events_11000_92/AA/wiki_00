The race was won by Émile Mayade who completed the ten-day, 1,710 km, event over unsurfaced roads in 67 hours driving a Panhard et Levassor.\n\nThe event was organised by the Automobile Club de France (ACF) and was sometimes retrospectively known as the \"II Grand Prix de l'A.C.F.\". It was run in 10 stages from Paris via Auxerre; Dijon; Lyon; Avignon; Marseille; Avignon; Lyon; Dijon; Sens and return to Paris.\n\nThe first competitive 'city to city' motoring event had been the 1894 Paris–Rouen where the Count Jules-Albert de Dion was first into Rouen but steam-powered vehicles were ineligible for the main prize. Likewise, in 1895 the nascent Automobile Club de France) (ACF) organised its first event, the Paris–Bordeaux–Paris race, but excluded two-seater cars such that their official winner, a four-seater, finished 11 hours after Émile Levassor. The outcry resulting from the 1895 result lead the \"A.C.F.\" to organise the Paris–Marseille–Paris Trail as the first fully competitive motor race, where the first car across the line was the winner.\n\nOn 8 February 1896 the race was announced in \"La France Automobile\", the second edition of the \"A.C.F.'s\" official magazine.\n\nThe entry list included : seven De Dion-Boutons (5 gasoline powered tricycles and 2 steam powered cars); five Bollées (comprising four Léon Bollée tricycles and tandems plus an Amédée Bollée); four Panhard et Levassors; three Peugeots; two Delahayes; two Société Parisiennes and two Triouleyres. There were also single car entries from Fisson; Landry et Beyroux (or poss. Landoy); Lebrun; Rochet-Schneider; Rossel and Tissandier.\n\n\nOn 20 September, the weekend prior to the start of the race, a selection trial (\"prologue\") was run from Paris-Mantes-Paris for bicycles and tricycles of less than 150 kilograms. The eight successful machines were classified as either engine powered or engine and pedal powered. The two self-powered machines were the single seat, petrol-powered 'Wolfmüller' motorcycle (No 31) ridden by D'Ofraiville; and the Hurtu-Léon Bollée tricycle No. 50 of C. Chauveau. The pedal machines (mopeds) were all De Dion-Bouton tricycles ridden by Chevalier (No. 52); Delieuvin (No. 15); Clere (No. 51); Fernand Charron (No. 13); and Comte Laubat Gaston De Chasseloup (No. 14).\n\nThe race covered 1,710 km from Paris to Marseilles and return from 24 September-3 October 1896.\n\nThe race was scheduled to be run over 10 daily stages without rest days.\nThe 32 entrants started the first stage from under the Place de l'Étoile in Paris and raced 177 km to Auxerre where the winner was Lejane who had driven his Bollée at over 31 km/hour. Unfortunately his glory was short lived as he retired the following day. The first of the Panhard et Levassors came to the fore on the second stage from Auxere to Dijon, when Émile Levassor covered the 150.95 km over unsurfaced roads in 6 hours 51 minutes, thus taking the overall lead. Levassor increased his lead by also winning the third stage into Lyon, but his race was ruined when he suffered an accident on the fourth stage into Avignon. Although he persevered until the end of the stage, he then handed over the driving to his riding mechanic Charles d'Hostingue and they continued steadily until the finishing fourth overall in Paris. Levassor would never fully recover from the accident and the stress of driving another 36 hours, and died early in 1897. The stage was won by Merkel driving another one of Émile Levassor's cars. The fifth stage into the halfway point at Marseille was won by Viet riding on a gasoline powered De Dion tricycle, and he also won the next stage leaving Marseille back to Avignon. In a remarkable piece of symmetry Merkel again won the stage between Avignon and Lyon, a move that started Panhard et Levassor's dominant performance as Emile Mayade dominated the final three stages back to Paris and overall victory. Panhard et Levassor had won seven of the ten stages.\n\nThe winning 8 hp Panhard et Levassor of Mayade had been extensively upgraded for 1896, using their first four-cylinder engine, doubling the horsepower from the 1895 model. It was equipped with tiller steering and candle lamps. The brakes were a spoon-lever pressing on the solid rubber back tyre plus a belt that tightened onto a drum on the transmission.\n\nParis-Marseilles-Paris Trail - 24 September - 3 October 1896 – 1710 km\n\n\nThe overall results were:\nThe stage-winners were:\n\nEntrants who did not finish :\n\n\nItalian Wikipedia accredited sources:\n"}

Training camps were opened in Syria and in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley and propaganda teams were sent across the border to make contact with the local populations. After years of preparation, the PKK launched its first major attacks on 15 August 1984. The attack was led by the founder of the PKK's military wing.\n\nPKK forces attacked the gendarmerie station in Eruh in Siirt and killed one gendarmerie soldier and injured six soldiers and three civilians. Simultaneously, PKK forces attacked a gendarmerie open-air facility, officer housings and a gendarmerie station in Şemdinli, Hakkâri and killed two police officers and injured one police officer and a soldier.\n\nInitially, Turkish authorities did not take the attacks seriously, however the attack was followed up by a raid on a police station in Siirt on 17 August, which was soon followed by an attack that killed three of General Kenan Evren's Presidential Guards in Yüksekova and an ambush which killed 8 Turkish soldiers in Çukurca, in Hakkâri province.\n\nInsurgent violence in the predominantly Kurdish South-East of Turkey escalated heavily after the attacks. Around 2,500 people were killed during the conflict between the 15 August 1984 and 1991. This number rose to 17,500 between 1991 and 1992 and the Turkish state puts the number of people killed by the insurgency at 44,000 as of September 2008.\n\n"}

According to the Assyrian account of the battle, the Elamites were heavily defeated.

{"id": "263530", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263530", "title": "Durrës", "text": "Durrës\n\nDurrës (; , ), historically known as Epidamnos and Dyrrachium, is the second most populous city of the Republic of Albania. The city is the capital of the surrounding Durrës County, one of 12 constituent counties of the country. By air, it is northwest of Sarandë, west of Tirana, south of Shkodër and east of Rome. Located on the Adriatic Sea, it is the country's most ancient and economic and historic center.\n\nFounded by Greek colonists from Corinth and Corfu under the name of Epidamnos () around the 7th century BC, the city essentially developed to become significant as it became an integral part of the Roman Empire and its successor the Byzantine Empire. The Via Egnatia, the continuation of the Via Appia, started in the city and led across the interior of the Balkan Peninsula to Constantinople in the east. In the Middle Ages, it was contested between Bulgarian, Venetian and Ottoman dominions.\nFollowing the Albanian Declaration of Independence, the city served as the capital of the Principality of Albania for a short period of time. Subsequently, it was annexed by the Kingdom of Italy and Nazi Germany in the interwar period. Moreover, the city experienced a strong expansion in its demography and economic activity during the Communism in Albania.\n\nDurrës is served by the Port of Durrës, one of the largest on the Adriatic Sea, which connects the city to Italy and other neighbouring countries. Its most considerable attraction is the Amphitheatre of Durrës that is included on the tentative list of Albania for designation as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Once having a capacity for 20,000 people, it is the largest amphitheatre in the Balkan Peninsula.\n\nIn antiquity, the city was named \"Epidamnos\" (Ἐπίδαμνος) and \"Dyrrhachion\" (Δυρράχιον) in Greek, corresponding to Latin \"Epidamnus\" and \"Dyrrachium\". The name \"Dyrrhachion\" is usually explained as a Greek compound from 'bad' and 'rocky shore, flood, roaring waves', an explanation already hinted at in antiquity by Cassius Dio, who writes it referred to the difficulties of the rocky coastline, while also reporting that other Roman authors linked it to the name of an eponymous hero \"Dyrrachius\". The modern names of the city in Albanian (\"Durrës\") and Italian (\"Durazzo\") are derived from \"Dyrrachium\" through the Medieval Slavic form \"Дърачь\" (Dŭračĭ) (modern Serbian: \"Драч/Drač\" (Dratch)), from the era when the city was held by the Bulgarian and Serbian empires. This is also the root of the Ottoman Turkish name \"Dıraç\".\n\nIn English usage, the Italian form \"Durazzo\" used to be widespread, but the local Albanian name \"Durrës\" has gradually replaced it in recent decades.\n\nThough surviving remains are minimal, as one of the oldest cities in Albania, the city was founded as \"Epidamnos\" in the ancient region of Illyria in 627 BC by ancient Greek colonists from Corinth and Corcyra, modern-day Corfu. The Romans replaced the rule of Teuta with that of Demetrius of Pharos, one of her generals. He lost his kingdom, including Epidamnus, to the Romans in 219 BC at the Second Illyrian War. In the Third Illyrian War Epidamnus was attacked by Gentius but he was defeated by the Romans at the same year.\n\nFor Catullus, the city was \"Durrachium Hadriae tabernam\", \"the \"taberna\" of the Adriatic\", one of the stopping places for a Roman traveling up the Adriatic, as Catullus had done himself in the sailing season of 56.\n\nAfter the Illyrian Wars with the Roman Republic in 229 BC ended in a decisive defeat for the Illyrians, the city passed to Roman rule, under which it was developed as a major military and naval base. The Romans renamed it \"Dyrrachium\" (Greek: Δυρράχιον / \"Dyrrhachion\"). They considered the name \"Epidamnos\" to be inauspicious because of its wholly coincidental similarities with the Latin word \"damnum\", meaning \"loss\" or \"harm\". The meaning of \"Dyrrachium\" (\"bad spine\" or \"difficult ridge\" in Greek) is unclear, but it has been suggested that it refers to the imposing cliffs near the city. Julius Caesar's rival Pompey made a stand there in 48 BC before fleeing south to Greece. Under Roman rule, Dyrrachium prospered; it became the western end of the \"Via Egnatia\", the great Roman road that led to Thessalonica and on to Constantinople. Another lesser road led south to the city of \"Buthrotum\", the modern Butrint. The Roman emperor Caesar Augustus made the city a colony for veterans of his legions following the Battle of Actium, proclaiming it a \"civitas libera\" (free town).\n\nIn the 4th century, Dyrrachium was made the capital of the Roman province of Epirus nova. It was the birthplace of the emperor Anastasius I in c. 430. Sometime later that century, Dyrrachium was struck by a powerful earthquake which destroyed the city's defences. Anastasius I rebuilt and strengthened the city walls, thus creating the strongest fortifications in the western Balkans. The walls were so thick that, according to the Byzantine historian Anna Komnene, four horsemen could ride abreast on them. Significant portions of the ancient city defences still remain, although they have been much reduced over the centuries.\n\nLike much of the rest of the Balkans, Dyrrachium and the surrounding \"Dyrraciensis provinciae\" suffered considerably from barbarian incursions during the Migrations Period. It was besieged in 481 by Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, and in subsequent centuries had to fend off frequent attacks by the Bulgarians. Unaffected by the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the city continued under the Byzantine Empire as an important port and a major link between the Empire and western Europe.\n\nThe city and the surrounding coast became a Byzantine province, the Theme of Dyrrhachium, probably in the first decade of the 9th century. The city remained in Byzantine hands until the late 10th century, when Samuel of Bulgaria gained control of the city, possibly through his marriage with Agatha, daughter of the local magnate John Chryselios. Samuel made his son-in-law Ashot Taronites, a Byzantine captive who had married his daughter Miroslava, governor of the city. In circa 1005, however, Ashot and Miroslava, with the connivance of Chryselios, fled to Constantinople, where they notified Emperor Basil II of their intention to surrender the city to him. Soon, a Byzantine squadron appeared off the city under Eustathios Daphnomeles, and the city returned to Byzantine rule.\n\nIn the 11th–12th centuries, the city was important as a military stronghold and a metropolitan see rather than as a major economic center, and never recovered its late antique prosperity; Anna Komnene makes clear that medieval Dyrrhachium occupied only a portion of the ancient city. In the 1070s, two of its governors, Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder and Nikephoros Basilakes, led unsuccessful rebellions trying to seize the Byzantine throne. Dyrrachium was lost in February 1082 when Alexios I Komnenos was defeated by the Normans under Robert Guiscard and his son Bohemund in the Battle of Dyrrhachium. Byzantine control was restored a few years later, but the Normans under Bohemund returned to besiege it in 1107–08, and sacked it again in 1185 under King William II of Sicily. In 1205, after the Fourth Crusade, the city was transferred to the rule of the Republic of Venice, which formed the \"Duchy of Durazzo\". This Duchy was conquered in 1213 and the city taken by the Despotate of Epirus under Michael I Komnenos Doukas. In 1257, Durrës was briefly occupied by the King of Sicily, Manfred of Hohenstaufen. It was re-occupied by the Despot of Epirus Michael II Komnenos Doukas until 1259, when the Despotate was defeated by the Byzantine Empire of Nicaea in the Battle of Pelagonia. In the 1270s, Durrës was again controlled by Epirus under Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, the son of Michael II, who in 1278 was forced to yield the city to Charles d' Anjou (Charles I of Sicily). In c. 1273, it was wrecked by a devastating earthquake (according to George Pachymeres; R. Elsie, \"Early Albania\" (2003), p. 12) but soon recovered. It was briefly occupied by King Milutin of Serbia in 1296.\n\nIn the early 14th century, the city was ruled by a coalition of Anjous, Hungarians, and Albanians of the Thopia family. In 1317 or 1318, the area was taken by the Serbs and remained under their rule until the 1350s. At that time the Popes, supported by the Anjous, increased their diplomatic and political activity in the area, by using the Latin bishops, including the archbishop of Durrës. The city had been a religious center of Catholicism after the Anjou were installed in Durrës. In 1272, a Catholic archbishop was installed, and until the mid-14th century there were both Catholic and Orthodox archbishops of Durrës.\n\nTwo Irish pilgrims who visited Albania on their way to Jerusalem in 1322, reported that Durrës was \"inhabited by Latins, Greeks, perfidious Jews and barbaric Albanians\".\n\nWhen the Serbian Tsar Dušan died in 1355, the city passed into the hands of the Albanian family of Thopias. In 1376 the Navarrese Company Louis of Évreux, Duke of Durazzo, who had gained the rights on the Kingdom of Albania from his second wife, attacked and conquered the city, but in 1383 Karl Topia regained control of the city. The Republic of Venice regained control in 1392 and retained the city, known as \"Durazzo\" in those years, as part of the \"Albania Veneta\". It fended off a siege by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1466 but fell to Ottoman forces in 1501.\n\nDurrës became a Christian city quite early on; its bishopric was created around 58 and was raised to the status of an archbishopric in 449. It was also the seat of a Greek Orthodox metropolitan bishop. Under Turkish rule, many of its inhabitants converted to Islam and many mosques were erected. This city was renamed as Dıraç but did not prosper under the Ottomans and its importance declined greatly. By the mid-19th century, its population was said to have been only about 1,000 people living in some 200 households. In the late nineteenth century, Durrës contained 1,200 Orthodox Aromanians (130 families) who lived among the larger population of Muslim Albanians alongside a significant number of Catholic Albanians. The decrepitude of Durrës was noted by foreign observers in the early 20th century: \"The walls are dilapidated; plane-trees grow on the gigantic ruins of its old Byzantine citadel; and its harbour, once equally commodious and safe, is gradually becoming silted up.\" Durrës was a main centre in İşkodra Vilayet before 1912.\n\nDurrës was an active city in the Albanian national liberation movement in the periods 1878–1881 and 1910–1912. Ismail Qemali raised the Albanian flag on 26 November 1912 but the city was occupied by the Kingdom of Serbia three days later during the First Balkan War. On 29 November 1912 Durrës became the county town of the Durrës County () one of the counties of the Kingdom of Serbia established on the part of the territory of Albania occupied from Ottoman Empire. \nThe Durrës County had four districts (): Durrës, Lezha, Elbasan and Tirana. The army of the Kingdom of Serbia retreated from Durrës in April 1913. The city became Albania's second national capital (after Vlora) on 7 March 1914 under the brief rule of Prince William of Wied. It remained Albania's capital until 11 February 1920, when the Congress of Lushnjë made Tirana the new capital.\n\nDuring the First World War, the city was occupied by Italy in 1915 and by Austria-Hungary in 1916–1918. On 29 December 1915, a Naval Battle was fought off Durazzo. \nOn 2 October 1918, several allied ships bombarded Durazzo and attacked the few Austrian ships in the harbour. Although civilians started to flee the city at the start of the bombardment, many casualties were inflicted on the innocent and neutral population. The Old City being adjacent to the harbour was largely destroyed, including the Royal Palace of Durrës and other primary public buildings. \nIt was captured by Italian troops on 16 October 1918. \nRestored to Albanian sovereignty, Durrës became the country's temporary capital between 1918 and March 1920. It experienced an economic boom due to Italian investments and developed into a major seaport under the rule of King Zog, with a modern harbour being constructed in 1927. It was at this time the Royal Villa of Durrës was built by Zog as a summer palace, that still dominates the skyline from a hill close to the old city. \n\nAn earthquake in 1926 damaged some of the city and the rebuilding that followed gave the city its more modern appearance. During the 1930s, the Bank of Athens had a branch in the city. \n\nDurrës (called \"Durazzo\" again in Italian) and the rest of Albania were occupied in April 1939 and annexed to the Kingdom of Italy until 1943, then occupied by Nazi Germany until autumn 1944. Durrës's strategic value as a seaport made it a high-profile military target for both sides. It was the site of the initial Italian landings on 7 April 1939 (and was fiercely defended by Mujo Ulqinaku) as well as the launch point for the ill-fated Italian invasion of Greece. The city was heavily damaged by Allied bombing during the war and the port installations were blown up by retreating German soldiers in autumn 1944.\n\nThe Communist regime of Enver Hoxha rapidly rebuilt the city following the war, establishing a variety of heavy industries in the area and expanding the port. It became the terminus of Albania's first railway, begun in 1947 (Durrës–Tiranë railway). In the late 1980s, the city was briefly renamed Durrës-Enver Hoxha. The city was and continues to remain the center of Albanian mass beach tourism.\nFollowing the collapse of communist rule in 1990, Durrës became the focus of mass emigrations from Albania with ships being hijacked in the harbour and sailed at gunpoint to Italy. In one month alone, August 1991, over 20,000 people migrated to Italy in this fashion. Italy intervened militarily, putting the port area under its control, and the city became the center of the European Community's \"Operation Pelican\", a food-aid program.\nIn 1997, Albania slid into anarchy following the collapse of a massive pyramid scheme which devastated the national economy. An Italian-led peacekeeping force was controversially deployed to Durrës and other Albanian cities to restore order, although there were widespread suggestions that the real purpose of \"Operation Alba\" was to prevent economic refugees continuing to use Albania's ports as a route to migrate to Italy.\n\nFollowing the start of the 21st century, Durrës has been revitalized as many streets were repaved, while parks and façades experienced a face lift.\n\nDurrës is located in a flat alluvial plain on the southeastern Adriatic Sea at one of the narrower points opposite the cities of Bari and Brindisi in Italy. It lies mostly between latitudes 41° and 19° N and longitudes 19° and 27° E. By air distance, it is northwest of Sarandë, west of Tirana, south Shkodër and east of Rome.\n\nThe climate of the city is profoundly impacted by the Mediterranean Sea in the west. Further it experiences mostly mediterranean climate with continental influences. The summers are predominantly hot and dry, the winters relatively mild, and falls and springs mainly stable, in terms of precipitation and temperatures.\n\nAccording to data from the National Census in 2011, the Urban areas of Durrës include 201,110 people. Durrës is one of largest cities on the Adriatic Sea and ranks 5th with a population of 175,110. The total population is 175,110 (2011 census), in a total area of 338.30 km. The population of the former municipality at the 2011 census was 113,249. The metropolitan area has a population of 265,330.\n\nChristianity in Albania has a presence dating back to classical antiquity. Christian traditions relate that the archbishopric of Durrës was founded by the apostle Paul while preaching in Illyria and Epirus and that there were possibly about seventy Christian families in Durrës as early as the time of the Apostles. The Orthodox Church of Albania, which has been autocephalous since 1923 was divided into the archbishopric of Tirana – Durrës, headed by the Metropolitan and sub-divided into the local church districts of Tirana, Durrës, Shkodër and Elbasan. The religious composition of Durrës consists of Muslims, both (Sunni and Bektashi) alongside Christians (Catholic and Orthodox) who form a significant part of the urban population.\n\nDurrës has a long tradition of education since the beginning of civil life from antiquity until today. After the fall of communism in Albania, a reorganization plan was announced in 1990, that would extend the compulsory education program from eight to ten years. The following year, major economic and political crisis in Albania, and the ensuing breakdown of public order, plunged the school system into chaos. Later, many schools were rebuilt or reconstructed, to improve learning conditions especially in larger cities of the country. Durrës is host to academic institutions such as the University of Durrës, Albanian College of Durrës, Kajtazi Brothers Educational Institute, Gjergj Kastrioti High School, Naim Frashëri High School, Sports mastery school Benardina Qerraxhiu and Jani Kukuzeli Artistic Lycee.\n\nDurrës is an important link to Western Europe due to its port and its proximity to the Italian port cities, notably Bari, to which daily ferries run. As well as the dockyard, it also possesses an important shipyard and manufacturing industries, notably producing leather, plastic and tobacco products.\nThe southern coastal stretch of Golem is renowned for its traditional mass beach tourism having experienced uncontrolled urban development. The city's beaches are also a popular destination for many foreign and local tourists, with an estimated 800,000 tourists visiting annually. Many Albanians from Tirana and elsewhere spend their summer vacations on the beaches of Durrës. \nIn 2012, new water sanitation systems are being installed to completely eliminate sea water pollution. In contrast, the northern coastal stretch of Lalzit Bay is mostly unspoiled and set to become an elite tourism destination as a number of beach resorts are being built since 2009. Neighboring districts are known for the production of good wine and a variety of foodstuffs.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, Durrës has made significant steps of starting a business in 2016. Durrës ranks 9 among 22 cities in Southeastern Europe before the capital Tirana, Belgrade, Serbia and Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nMajor roads and railways pass through the city of Durrës thank to its significant location and connect the northern part of the country to the south and the west with the east. Durrës is the starting point of Pan-European Corridor VIII, national roads SH2 and SH4, and serves as the main railway station of the Albanian Railways (HSH).\n\nThe Pan-European Corridor VIII is one of the Pan-European corridors. It runs between Durrës, at the Adriatic coast, and Varna, at the Bulgarian Black Sea coast. The National Road 2 (SH2) begins at the Port of Durrës at the Dajlani Overpass, bypasses the road to Tirana International Airport, and ends at the Kamza Overpass in the outskirts of Tirana where it meets National Road 1 (SH1) State Road heading to northern Albania. The Albania–Kosovo Highway is a four-lane highway constructed from 2006 to 2013 between Albania and Kosovo. As part of the South-East European Route 7, the highway will connect the Adriatic Sea ports of Durrës via Pristina, with the E75/Corridor X near Niš, Serbia. As most tourists come through Kosovo, the laying of the highway make it easier to travel to Durrës.\n\nThe very advantageous geographical location makes the port of Durrës to the greatest port of Albania, and among the largest in the Adriatic and Ionian Sea. The port is located in the south-western part of Durrës it is an artificial basin that is formed between two moles, with a west-northwesterly oriented entrance approximately wide as it passes between the ends of the moles.\nPort of Durrës is also a key location for transit networks and passenger ferry, giving Durrës a strategic position with respect to the Pan-European Corridor VIII. The port has experienced major upgrades in recent years culminating with the opening of the new terminal in July 2012. \nIn 2012, The Globe and Mail ranked Durrës at no. 1 among 8 exciting new cruise ports to explore. It is one of the largest passenger port on the Adriatic Sea that handle more than 1.5 million passengers per year.\n\nThe rail station of Durrës is connected to other cities in Albania, including Vlorë and the capital of Tirana. The Durrës–Tiranë railway was a railway line which joined the two biggest cities in Albania: Durrës and Tiranë. The line connects to the Shkodër–Vorë railway halfway in Vorë, and to the Durrës-Vlorë railway in Durrës. In 2015, some rail stations and rolling stock along the Durrës-Tiranë line are being upgraded and latter colored red and white.\n\nIn October 2016 they will start building a new railway with the cost of €81.5 million. And it is expected that it will be used around 1.4 million times a year.\n\nOne of the city's main sights is the Byzantine city wall, also called Durrës Castle, while the largest amphitheatre in the Balkans is found close to the city's harbour. This fifth-century construction is currently under consideration for inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nThe theatrical and musical life of the city is constituted by the Aleksandër Moisiu Theatre, the Estrada Theater, a puppet theater, and the philharmonic orchestra. The International Film Summerfest of Durrës, founded in 2008, has since takes place every year in late August or early September in Durrës Amphitheatre. In 2004 and 2009 Miss Globe International was held in Durrës.\n\nThe city is home to different architectural styles that represent influential periods in its history. The architecture is influenced by Illyrian, Greek, Roman and Italian architecture. In the 21st century, part of Durrës has turned into a modernist city, with large blocks of flats, modern new buildings, new shopping centres and many green spaces.\n\nDurrës is home to the largest archaeological museum in the country, the Durrës Archaeological Museum, located near the beach. North of the museum are the sixth-century Byzantine walls constructed after the Visigoth invasion of 481. The bulk of the museum consists of artifacts found in the nearby ancient site of Dyrrhachium and includes an extensive collection from the Illyrian, Ancient Greek, Hellenistic and Roman periods. Items of major note include Roman funeral steles and stone sarcophagi, an elliptical colourful mosaic measuring 17 by 10 feet, referred to as The Beauty of Durrës, and a collection of miniature busts of Venus, testament to the time when Durrës was a centre of worship of the goddess. There are several further museums such as the Royal Villa of Durrës and the Museum of History (the house of Aleksandër Moisiu).\n\nThese countries have an honorary consulate in Durrës: \n\nBosnia has opened a consulate in Durrës in 2011 for the people of Bosniak origin who live in Durrës, Shijak city and villages around, Koxhas and Borake.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10411857", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10411857", "title": "Fantastic Easter Special", "text": "Fantastic Easter Special\n\n\"Fantastic Easter Special\" is the fifth episode of the eleventh season of the American animated television series \"South Park\", and the 158th episode of the series overall. It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 4, 2007. The episode parodies \"The Da Vinci Code\". The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA in the United States.\n\nDetermined to get the real story behind why he has to decorate eggs for Easter, Stan starts asking his Dad some tough questions. The answers lead to an ancient and mysterious secret society created in the Middle Ages to protect the secret of the Easter Bunny. Threats to the sanctity of Easter are imminent from Bill Donohue and the Catholic League.\n\nAs the Marsh family colors eggs for Easter, Stan questions what it has to do with Jesus. Not satisfied by his father Randy's vague response, Stan storms off and asks the same question to a mall Easter Bunny. The mall bunny tells Stan that it is \"just Easter\", and to \"just go with it\", then makes a mysterious phone call.\n\nStan soon finds himself being chased by men in bunny suits. When he gets home, he finds that Randy is part of the plot. Randy calls the men off, and tells Stan that he is in a society called \"The Hare Club for Men\", who have guarded the secret of Easter for generations. Randy takes Stan to the headquarters of the Hare Club, where he is to be initiated into the group, which reveres a rabbit named Snowball. The Hare Club for Men's building resembles a Masonic Hall. Much of the ritual borrows from the practice of Freemasons. Just as he is about to learn the secret of Easter, Stan's initiation is interrupted as the club is ambushed by a group of ninjas. The Hare Club members rush to protect Snowball, and Randy gives the rabbit to Stan, telling him to run. He escapes with Snowball, and witnesses the ninjas and their leader, William Anthony Donohue, executing a resisting hare and interrogating Randy. Stan runs off to Kyle's house and tries to extract any knowledge Kyle has of Easter. Kyle, who is Jewish and says he knows nothing about Easter, does not want to be involved in something so dangerous, but Stan persuades him to help.\n\nStan and Kyle manage to track down a man named Professor Teabag (spoof of Professor Teabing), who supposedly knows the secret of the Hare Club. Teabag lets them in his mansion and explains that Leonardo da Vinci was actually a member of the Hare Club and that Saint Peter was not a man, but a rabbit (Peter Rabbit), and reveals that da Vinci originally portrayed Saint Peter as a rabbit instead of as a man in his painting of the Last Supper. Teabag explains that Jesus knew that no human could speak for all Christianity without any acts of corruption, and that rabbits were pure, tolerant, and incorruptible. This is why the Pope's mitre is shaped to accommodate a rabbit's ears. He also explained that the Church decided to bury the secret and put a man in charge. Ever since, \"The Hare Club for Men\" society members have decorated eggs for generations to keep the secret in da Vinci's painting alive. He further explains that Snowball is actually a direct descendant from St. Peter, and that Stan's father and the members of the Hare Club have been kidnapped by the Vatican, who wish to cover up this secret, viewing it as blasphemy. Donohue's ninja minions then attack again and kill Teabag's butler, but Teabag helps the two boys escape by putting marshmallow Peeps in the microwave. It causes an explosion that destroys the mansion, killing both Teabag and the ninjas.\n\nStan and Kyle go to the Vatican where Stan turns the rabbit over to the Donohue's men, on the condition that the Hare Club members must all be set free and that Snowball remain unharmed. However, Donohue reveals he had actually made the promise on two separate crucifixes, a \"double cross\", and plans to make an example of the Hare Club. Pope Benedict XVI opposes this, saying that double-crossing is not considered to be \"very Christian,\" something which Donohue responds by saying that it is what Jesus would have wanted. Jesus himself (after resurrecting from being killed in Iraq) then arrives to intervene, answering the prayer of one of the Hare Club members. He tells them that he actually did plan for the popes to be rabbits, citing the current corruption of Donohue. Benedict and his clergy are willing to listen and agree with Jesus, but Donohue refuses to listen and orders Benedict to execute Jesus for 'going against the Church'. Outraged to see how arrogant Donohue is, Benedict angrily refuses, saying that killing Jesus is not \"very Christian.\" Enraged, Donohue seizes the Pope's mitre, and orders his ninjas to capture everyone including Benedict and Jesus. Donohue declares himself the new Pope. With the clergy unable to stop him, Donohue orders his minions to lock up Kyle and Jesus, whom he calls the \"two Jews\", and Benedict to deal with later. Donohue then leads Randy, Stan, and the surviving Hare Club members to the block where there is a gigantic pot for Snowball's execution.\n\nIn the cell, Benedict apologizes to Jesus for his actions, pleading for forgiveness. Jesus tells Kyle that his \"superpowers\" only work when he is dead, and the only way to escape is for Kyle to kill him so he can return to life outside the cell. Kyle is hesitant to kill Jesus, but does so after Jesus promises that \"Eric Cartman can never know about this\". As Donohue is about to execute Snowball in front of Randy, Stan, and the Hare Club members, the resurrected Jesus appears in the crowd. Jesus then kills Donohue and everyone cheers for Jesus and Snowball is elected Pope. Because he is a rabbit, Snowball cannot speak or tell people how they should lead their lives, just as \"Jesus intended\". Stan reveals that he has learned his lesson through all of his adventures: do not ask questions; just dye the eggs and keep his mouth shut, and Randy is proud of him.\n\nIn the commentary, the creators called it their \"The Da Vinci Code\" episode, emphasizing the conspiracy and searching for clues in the eggs. Bill Donohue had been quoted by several news outlets during coverage of previous Southpark episodes Bloody Mary and Trapped in the Closet, but \"Bill Donohue is not the emperor of Catholics.\"\n\nJesus then kills Donohue by throwing a five bladed sword similar to the one featured in the movie Krull.\n\nIGN gave the episode a rating of 10, citing it a \"masterpiece\" and \"controlled comic chaos that only South Park seems able to manage on such a consistent basis.\".\n\nIn 2009, \"Time\" magazine listed the episode as #10 on their list of Top 10 Jesus Films, praising the conspiracy story and its resemblance to The Da Vinci Code and \nthe lyrics of “Peter Cottontail” in Latin.\n\nErik Hinton of \"PopMatters\" praised the episode saying, \"they do like killing Jesus, but it’s in the service of a profound message of religious tolerance and even-handed treatment.\"\n\nThe real Donohue has a still of himself wearing the papal mitre from this episode displayed in his office. He sums up the plot as \"In the episode, they have me overthrow the pope because the pope is a wimp, and then I take over the church and give it some guts. ... But in the end, Jesus kills me\".\n\n"}

The building was inaugurated in 1894.\n\nThe theatre is the host for the annual festival Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden, established in 1896 after the Bayreuth Festival.\n\nThe building of the theatre was initiated and substantially supported by the German emperor William I who regularly visited the spa in Wiesbaden. A competition was won by a team of architects from Vienna, Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer. They erected the building from 1892 to 1894 in Baroque Revival style, following models in Prague and Zurich. The inauguration was on 16 October 1894 in the presence of the emperor. The Foyer was built in 1902 by architect Felix Genzmer. It serves three stages.\n\nAfter World War I the theatre was renamed \"Preußisches Staatstheater\" (Prussian State Theatre). Since 1932 the city of Wiesbaden was responsible for the theatre, therefore it was renamed \"Nassauisches Landestheater\" (Theater of the Province Nassau).\nThe building was seriously damaged in World War II by a bomb on 3 February 1945. The front was restored in a simplified way and the ceiling of the hall was decorated with a contemporary painting.\n\nIn 1946 the State of Hesse took over the operation of the theatre.

The urban legend has been circulating via the internet since the mid-1990s. Many print newspapers have been fooled into publishing the story as fact.\n\nThe story goes that a freak accident occurred at a circus during an act involving a dwarf bouncing on a trampoline. The dwarf jumped sideways off the trampoline just at the moment a hippopotamus had decided to yawn. The dwarf landed in the hippo's yawning mouth and was abruptly, and accidentally, swallowed whole. The audience applauded until they realised this was not part of the show and the true horror set in.\n\nEuan Ferguson writing in \"The Observer\" in 2003 said the story is a marvelous metaphor for the reality that \"Life is not safe. You can't plan for disaster. The hippo can get you at any time.\"\n\nAccording to \"Snopes\", the hoax news story began circulating on the internet with a Usenet post in 1994. The story was allegedly taken from the \"National Lampoon\" magazine which in turn, again according to \"Snopes\", attributed it to the \"Las Vegas Sun\". However, according to Alex Boese, the story cannot be found in back issues of either the \"Sun\" or \"National Lampoon\".\n\nThe original story was set in an Austrian circus, the hippo was named Hilda, and the dwarf was named Franz Dasch.

{"id": "5897131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5897131", "title": "Islamic views on Jesus' death", "text": "Islamic views on Jesus' death\n\nThe issue of the crucifixion, death and resurrection of Jesus (\"Isa\") is rejected by most Muslims, but similar to Christians they believe that Jesus will return before the end of time. Most Muslims believe Jesus was not crucified, but was raised bodily to heaven by God. A similar belief is found in the Gospel of Basilides, the text of which is lost save for reports of it by other early scholars like Origen (c. 185 – c. 254). Basilides, a theologian of Gnostic tendencies, taught in Alexandria in the second quarter of the second century. However, this view is disregarded by mainstream Christianity which only accepts the four gospels contained in the New Testament as genuine. The general Islamic view supporting the denial of crucifixion was probably influenced by Manichaenism (Docetism), which holds that someone else was crucified instead of Jesus, while concluding that Jesus will return during the end-times.\n\nDepending on the interpretation of the following verse, Muslim scholars have abstracted different opinions. Some believe that in the Biblical account, Jesus's crucifixion did not last long enough for him to die, while others opine that God gave someone Jesus's appearance or someone else replaced Jesus and the executioners thought the victim was Jesus, causing everyone to believe that Jesus was crucified. A third explanation could be that Jesus was nailed to a cross, but as his body is immortal he did not \"die\" or was not \"crucified\" [to death]; it only appeared so (this view is rare). In opposition to the second and third foregoing proposals, yet others maintain that God does not use deceit and therefore they contend that crucifixion just did not occur. The basis of all of these beliefs is the interpretation of this verse in the Qur'an:\n\nMost Islamic traditions, save for a few, categorically deny that Jesus physically died, either on a cross or another manner. The contention is found within the Islamic traditions themselves, with the earliest Hadith reports quoting the companions of Muhammad stating Jesus having died, while the majority of subsequent Hadith and Tafsir have elaborated an argument in favor of the denial through exegesis and apologetics, becoming the popular (orthodox) view.\n\nProfessor and scholar Mahmoud M. Ayoub sums up what the Quran states despite interpretative arguments:\n\nSome disagreement and discord can be seen beginning with Ibn Ishaq's (d. 761 CE/130 AH) report of a brief accounting of events leading up to the crucifixion, firstly stating that Jesus was replaced by someone named Sergius, while secondly reporting an account of Jesus' tomb being located at Medina and thirdly citing the places in the Qur'an (3:55; 4:158) that God took Jesus up to himself.\n\nAn early interpretation of verse 3:55 (specifically \"I will cause you to die and raise you to myself\"), Al-Tabari (d. 923 CE/310 AH) records an interpretation attributed to Ibn 'Abbas, who used the literal \"I will cause you to die\" (mumayyitu-ka) in place of the metaphorical mutawaffi-ka \"Jesus died\", while Wahb ibn Munabbih, an early Jewish convert, is reported to have said \"God caused Jesus, son of Mary, to die for three hours during the day, then took him up to himself.\" Tabari further transmits from Ibn Ishaq Bishr: \"God caused Jesus to die for seven hours\", while at another place reported that a person called Sergius was crucified in place of Jesus. Ibn-al-Athir forwarded the report that it was Judas, the betrayer, while also mentioning the possibility it was a man named Natlianus.\n\nAl-Masudi (d. 956 CE/343 AH) reported the death of Christ under Tiberius.\n\nQur'anic commentators seem to have concluded the denial of the crucifixion of Jesus by following material interpreted in Tafsir that relied upon extra-biblical sources, venturing away from the message conveyed in the Qur'an, with the earliest textual evidence having originated from a non-Muslim source; a misreading of the Christian writings of John of Damascus regarding the literal understandings of Docetism (exegetical doctrine describing spiritual and physical realities of Jesus as understood by men in logical terms) as opposed to their figurative explanations. John of Damascus highlighted the Qur'an's assertion that the Jews did not crucify Jesus being very different from saying that Jesus was not crucified, explaining that it is the varied Quranic exegetes in Tafsir, and not the Qur'an itself, that denies the crucifixion, further stating that the message in the 4:157 verse simply affirms the historicity of the event.\n\nJa'far ibn Mansur al-Yaman (d. 347 AH/958 CE), Abu Hatim Ahmad ibn Hamdan al-Razi (d. 322 AH/935 CE), Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani (d. 358 AH/971 CE), Mu'ayyad fi'l-Din al-Shirazi (d. 470 AH/1078 CE ) and the group Ikhwan al-Safa also affirm the historicity of the Crucifixion, reporting Jesus was crucified and not substituted by another man as maintained by many other popular Qur'anic commentators and Tafsir.\n\nIn reference to the Quranic quote \"We have surely killed Jesus the Christ, son of Mary, the apostle of God\", Muslim scholar Mahmoud Ayoub asserts this boast not as the repeating of a historical lie or the perpetuating of a false report, but an example of human arrogance and folly with an attitude of contempt towards God and His messenger(s). Ayoub furthers what modern scholars of Islam interpret regarding the historical death of Jesus, the man, as man's inability to kill off God's Word and the Spirit of God, which the Quran testifies were embodied in Jesus Christ. Ayoub continues highlighting the denial of the killing of Jesus as God denying men such power to vanquish and destroy the divine Word. The words, \"they did not kill him, nor did they crucify him\" speaks to the profound events of ephemeral human history, exposing mankind's heart and conscience towards God's will. The claim of humanity to have this power against God is illusory. \"They did not slay him...but it seemed so to them\" speaks to the imaginations of mankind, not the denial of the actual event of Jesus dying physically on the cross.\n\nDiscussing the interpretation of those scholars who deny the crucifixion, the Encyclopaedia of Islam writes:\n\nIn regard to the interpretation of the Muslims who accept the crucifixion, Mahmoud Ayoub states:\n\nUnlike the Christian view of the death of Jesus, most Muslims believe he was raised to Heaven without being put on the cross and God created a resemblance to appear exactly like Jesus who was crucified instead of Jesus. Muslims believe Jesus ascended bodily to Heaven, there to remain until his Second coming in the End days.\n\nThe identity of the substitute has been a source of great interest among Muslims. One proposal is that God used one of Jesus' enemies. Judas Iscariot, Jesus' betrayer, is often cited, and is mentioned in the Gospel of Barnabas. The second proposal is that Jesus asked for someone to volunteer to be crucified instead of him. Simon of Cyrene is the person most commonly accepted to have done it, perhaps because according to the Synoptic Gospels he was compelled by the Romans to carry Jesus' cross for him (there is no indication in the Gospels that he volunteered). Al-Baidawi writes that Jesus told his disciples in advance that whoever volunteered would go to heaven.\n\nTabari (d. 839–923/ 224–310 AH) divided the early reports regarding Jesus crucifixion into two groups. According to the first, one of Jesus disciples volunteers to take the form of his master and is crucified. According to the other, the Jew mistakenly carried only an empty resemblance to the cross.\n\nTabari narrated the first strand as follows:\n\nThe second strand is narrated as follows:\n\nThe Jews were looking for Jesus. They took hold of Simon, one of the disciples, and they said, \"This is one of his companions.\" And he denied it and said, \"I am not one of his disciples.\" So they left him. Others took hold of him and he likewise denied it. Then he heard the sound of the cock and he wept and it grieved him. 'On the morning of the next day one of his disciples went to the Jew and said, \"What will you give me if I lead you to the Messiah?\" He accepted their offer of thirty dirhams and led them to him. And a semblance had been made for them before that, and they took him and made certain of him and bound him with a cord and began to lead him and to say to him \"You used to bring the dead to life and to drive away Satan and heal the jinn-possessed so why not deliver yourself from this cord?\" And they spat on him and cast thorns on him until they brought him to the wood upon which they wanted to crucify him. And God raised Jesus to Himself. And they crucified the semblance which was made to them. And [Jesus] tarried seven [hours]. 'Then his mother, and the woman whom God had freed from jinn-possession when Jesus treated her, came weeping to where the crucified [semblance] was. And Jesus came to them both and said, \"Why are you weeping?\" They said, \"Because of You.\" He said, \"God raised me to Himself and I came to no harm. This [corpse] is something which was \"made a semblance to them\". Order the disciples to meet me at such and such place.\" Eleven met him at the place. Jesus missed the one who had sold him. They said, \"Because he regretted what he had done he commited suicide by strangling himself.\" Jesus replied, \"If he had turned towards God, God would have turned toward him\".\n\nIbn Kathir (d. 1373 CE/760 AH) follows traditions which suggest that a crucifixion did occur, but not with Jesus. After the event, Ibn Kathir reports the people were divided into three groups following three different narratives; The Jacobites believing 'God remained with us as long as He willed and then He ascended to Heaven;' The Nestorians believing 'The son of God was with us as long as he willed until God raised him to heaven;' and the third group of Christians who believing; 'The servant and messenger of God, Jesus, remained with us as long as God willed until God raised him to Himself.'\n\nThe following narration recorded in the Qur'anic exegesis of Ibn Kathir verse is related to the substitution of Jesus:\n\nIbn Abbas said, \"Just before God raised Jesus to the Heavens, Jesus went to his disciples, who were twelve inside the house. When he arrived, his hair was dripping with water (as if he had just had a bath) and he said, 'There are those among you who will disbelieve in me twelve times after you had believed in me.' He then asked, 'Who among you will volunteer for his appearance to be transformed into mine, and be killed in my place. Whoever volunteers for that, he will be with me (in Paradise).' One of the youngest ones among them volunteered, but Jesus asked him to sit down. Jesus asked again for a volunteer, and the same young man volunteered and Jesus asked him to sit down again. Then the young man volunteered a third time and Jesus said, 'You will be that man,' and the resemblance of Jesus was cast over that man while Jesus ascended to Heaven from a hole in the roof of the house. When the Jews came looking for Jesus, they found that young man and crucified him. Some of Jesus' followers disbelieved in him twelve times after they had believed in him. They then divided into three groups. One group, the Jacobites, said, 'God remained with us as long as He willed and then ascended to Heaven.' Another group, the Nestorians, said, 'The son of God was with us as long as he willed and God took him to Heaven.' Another group of Christians who said, 'The servant and Messenger of God remained with us as long as God willed, and God then took him to Him.' The two disbelieving groups cooperated against that third Christian group and they killed them. Ever since that happened, Islam was then veiled until God sent Muhammad.\" - Al-Nasa'i|\"Al-Kubra\", 6:489\n\nAt another place in his Quranic exegesis, Ibn Kathir narrates the story as follows: \n(The people conspiring against Jesus) envied him because of his prophethood and obvious miracles; curing the blind and leprous and bringing the dead back to life, by God's leave. He also used to make the shape of a bird from clay and blow in it, and it became a bird by God's leave and flew. 'Jesus performed other miracles that God honored him with, yet some defied and belied him and tried their best to harm him. God's Prophet 'Jesus could not live in any one city for long and he had to travel often with his mother, peace be upon them. Even so, some of the Jews were not satisfied, and they went to the king of Damascus at that time, a Greek polytheist who worshipped the stars. They told him that there was a man in Bayt Al-Maqdis misguiding and dividing the people in Jerusalem and stirring unrest among the king's subjects. The king became angry and wrote to his deputy in Jerusalem to arrest the rebel leader, stop him from causing unrest, crucify him and make him wear a crown of thorns. When the king's deputy in Jerusalem received these orders, he went with some Jews to the house that 'Jesus was residing in, and he was then with twelve, thirteen or seventeen of his companions. That day was a Friday, in the evening. They surrounded 'Jesus in the house, and when he felt that they would soon enter the house or that he would sooner or later have to leave it, he said to his companions, “Who volunteers to be made to look like me, for which he will be my companion in Paradise.”' A young man volunteered, but 'Jesus thought that he was too young. He asked the question a second and third time, each time the young man volunteering, prompting 'Jesus to say, “Well then, you will be that man.” God made the young man look exactly like 'Jesus, while a hole opened in the roof of the house, and 'Jesus was made to sleep and ascended to heaven while asleep. God said, “O 'Jesus! I will take you and raise you to myself.” When 'Jesus ascended, those who were in the house came out. When those surrounding the house saw the man who looked like Jesus, they thought that he was Jesus. So they took him at night, crucified him and placed a crown of thorns on his head. They then boasted that they killed Jesus'. Some Christians accepted their false claim, due to their ignorance and lack of reason. As for those who were in the house with Jesus, witnessed his ascension to heaven, while the rest thought that the Jews killed 'Jesus by crucifixion. They even said that Marry sat under the corpse of the crucified man and cried, and they say that the dead man spoke to her. All this was a test from God for His servants out of His wisdom. God explained this matter in the Glorious Quran which He sent to His honorable Messenger, whom He supported with miracles and clear, unequivocal evidence. God is the Most Truthful, and He is the Lord of the worlds Who knows the secrets, what the hearts conceal, the hidden matters in heaven and earth, what has occurred, what will occur, and what would occur if it was decreed. - Kathir I. , Tafsir Ibn Kathir\n\nThe Gospel of Barnabas (dated to the late 16th or early 17th centuries), also promotes a non-death narrative. The Gospel of Barnabas has been considered to be pseudo-biographical, or a false work, to the majority of western scholars. However, some academics suggest that it may contain some remnants of an earlier work (perhaps Gnostic, Ebionite or Diatessaronic), redacted to bring it more in line with Islamic doctrine.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Barnabas it was Judas, not Jesus, who was crucified on the cross. This work states that Judas' appearance was transformed to that of Jesus', when the former, out of betrayal, led the Roman soldiers to arrest Jesus who by then had already ascended to the heavens. The narrative states this transformation of appearance was unnoticed by the followers of Christ and his mother Mary. The Gospel of Barnabas then mentions that after three days since burial, Judas' body was stolen from his grave with rumors spreading of Jesus being risen from the dead. In following with Islamic lore, when Jesus was informed in the third heaven about what happened he prayed to God to be sent back to the earth, and later descended and gathered his mother, disciples, and followers and told them the truth of what happened. He then ascended back to the heavens, with the narrative continuing Islamic legend mirroring Christian doctrine of returning at the end of times as a just king.\n\nA less common opinion among Islamic scholars hold that the crucifixion of Jesus was just an illusion. Accordingly, Jesus' body was really put on the cross, but his spirit did not die, but ascended to heaven. Thus the Jew erred because they did not recognized the \"Messiah\", the spiritual form of Jesus.\nDocetists were some sects of early Christians who believed that Jesus' physical body was an illusion, as was his crucifixion; that is, Jesus only seemed to have a physical body and to physically die, but in reality he was incorporeal, a pure spirit, and hence could not physically die.\nThe Gospel of Peter is a docetic gospel. F. F. Bruce writes in a commentary of this gospel (Jesus and Christian Origins Outside the New Testament, p. 93):\n\n\"The docetic note in this narrative appears in the statement that Jesus, while being crucified, 'remained silent, as though he felt no pain', and in the account of his death. It carefully avoids saying that he died, preferring to say that he 'was taken up', as though he - or at least his soul or spiritual self - was 'assumed' direct from the cross to the presence of God. (We shall see an echo of this idea in the Qur'an.) Then the cry of dereliction is reproduced in a form which suggests that, at that moment, his divine power left the bodily shell in which it had taken up temporary residence.\"\"\n\nAnother scholar, Leirvik, believes that Quran and Hadith to have been influenced by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia.\n\nActs of John is also a docetic gospel. It is a collection of narratives and traditions ascribed to John the Apostle, who was the author of the Gospel of John. It is long known in fragmentary form. Together with the Acts of Paul it is considered one of the most significant of the apostolic Acts in the New Testament apocrypha. It was condemned as a Gnostic heresy by the Church.\nChapter 101 of this work continues with phrases like \"Therefore I have suffered none of the things which they will say of me\", \"You hear that I have suffered, yet I have suffered not,\" and \"(they say) that I was pierced, but I was not wounded; that I was hanged, but I was not hanged; that blood flowed from me, yet it did not flow; and, in a word, those things that they say of me I did not endure.\n\nSome modern Muslim scholars believe that Jesus was actually crucified on the cross but didn't die, instead pretending to be dead, or that he fell unconscious (\"swooned\") and was later revived in the tomb in the same mortal body. Accordingly, His appearances after three days in the tomb were merely perceived to be resurrection appearances. These types of theories are also known as swoon theory. These theories were first proposed by 17th or 18th century western scholars.\n\nMuslim preacher Ahmed Deedat of South Africa wrote several books, one particularly entitled \"Crucifixion or Cruci-fiction\" along with many video lectures widely printed and distributed all over the Muslim World. He takes a critical look at the events from the canonial four Gospels and theorizes an alternative scenario of what really happened, a scenario very similar to the swoon theory.\nAnother Muslim Scholar Zakir Naik also uses these theories in a debate with Pastor Ruknuddin Henry Pio.\nThere are some Christian sects in Japan who believe in a similar substitution though this theory contradicts with other Muslim beliefs about Jesus. According to local Japanese Christian sects, Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead his younger brother, Isukiri, took his place on the cross, while Jesus fled across Siberia to Mutsu Province, in northern Japan. Once in Japan, he became a rice farmer, married, and raised a family with three daughters near what is now Shingō. While in Japan, it is asserted that he traveled, learned, and eventually died at the age of 106. His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years. According to the customs of the time, Jesus' bones were collected, bundled, and buried in the mound purported to be the grave of Jesus Christ.There is also a museum in Japan which has \"evidence\" of these claims. See: Shingō, Aomori\n\nSome Islamic scholars like Sheikh Mohammed al-Ghazali (not Imam al-Ghazali) and Javed Ahmad Ghamidi argue that Jesus was rescued but was given death by God before he was ascended bodily as God never allows His messengers to be dishonored, even their dead bodies.\n\nThomas McElwain states that the context of the verse is clearly within the discussion of Jewish ridicule of Christians, not in context of whether or not Jesus died. He continues that the text could be interpreted as denying the death of Jesus at the hands of Jews rather than denying his death. He adds, however, \"the expressions against the crucifixion are strong, so that to interpret the meaning for Romans rather than Jews to have committed the act is also suspect\" and that if this meaning is correct, \"it would have been more effective to state that the Romans killed Jesus, rather than to emphasise that the Jews were not in possession of the facts.\"\n\nAccording to some translations, Jesus says in the Qur'an:\n\nI said not to them except what You commanded me - to worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them; but when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness. - Qur'an, sura 5 (Al-Ma'ida) ayah 117\n\nThe majority of Muslims translate the verb \"mutawafik\" (متوفيك) \"to terminate after a period of time\" while others translate it \"to die of natural causes\". Islamic scholars like Javed Ahmad Ghamidi consider it as the physical death of Jesus, and hence question the return of Jesus. Geoffrey Parrinder discusses different interpretations of the Qur'anic chapter 19, verse 33 and writes in his conclusion that \"the cumulative effect of the Qur'anic verse is strongly in favor of a real death\". This verse could also refer to the Second Coming of Jesus.\n\nThe following minority of translations or translators translate \"to die\":\n\nHowever, the majority of Qur'anic translators, including Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Muhammad Habib Shakir and Marmaduke Pickthall, do not translate as \"to die\".\n\nIbn Babawayh (d.991 CE) in \"Ikhmal ad Din\" recounts that Jesus went to a far country. This was adapted by the Ahmadiyya as the basis of their Jesus in India theory This is promoted also by writers such as Holger Kersten (1981). They claim Jesus is buried at the Roza Bal shrine in Srinagar. However, the Sunni Muslim authorities at the shrine deny this as heretical and say that it is a Muslim saint buried there. The claims of the theory have been examined in documentaries and generated tourist visits to the site. Scholarly reception has consistently dismissed the theories, such as Norbert Klatt (1988), and labelled speculation by Indologist Günter Grönbold (1985).\n\nDavid Marshall Lang stated in his 1957 book \"The Wisdom of Balahvar\" that confusion in diacritical markings in Arabic documents resulted in confusing Kashmir and Kushinara (the place of Buddha's death) with the place of the death of Jesus. Lang has stated that the term Budhasaf (Buddha-to-be) became Yudasaf, Iodasaph, and then Yuzasaf, and resulted in the assertions of Jesus being buried in Srinagar. In 1981 (in \"Jesus i Kashmir: Historien om en legend\") and then in 2011, Per Beskow also stated that confusion about the traditions regarding Gautama Buddha in the Bilawhar wa-Yudasaf legend had resulted in the confused assumption that Jesus was Yuzasaf and was buried in Kashmir.\n\nSimilar to mainstream Islamic views, the Ahmadiyya Movement consider Jesus was a mortal man, but go a step further to describe Jesus as a mortal man who died a natural death in India as opposed to having been raised alive to Heaven.\n\nThe view of Jesus having migrated to India had also been researched in the literature of authors independent of and predating the foundation of the movement but has almost universally been dismissed.\n\n\n"}

It was first noted by folklorist Carlos Drake in 1968 in texts collected by Indiana University students.\n\nThe legend involves a woman who is driving and being followed by a car or truck. The mysterious pursuer flashes his high beams, tailgates her, and sometimes even rams her vehicle. When she finally makes it home, she realizes that the driver was trying to warn her that there was a man (a murderer, or escaped mental patient) hiding in her back seat. Each time the man sat up to attack her, the driver behind had used his high beams to scare the killer, causing him to duck back down.\n\nIn some versions, the woman stops for gas, and the attendant asks her to come inside to sort out a problem with her credit card. Inside the station, he asks if she knows there's a man in her back seat. (An example of this rendition can be seen in the 1998 episode of \"Millennium\", \"The Pest House\".) In another, she sees a doll on the road in the moors, stops, and then the man gets in the back.\n\nIn another version, the woman gets into her car and then a crazed person leaps out from nowhere and starts shouting gibberish and slamming their hands on the car. The woman quickly manages to escape from them but no matter how far or which direction she drives, every time she stops, the same crazed person appears and attacks the car. The woman then arrives at a police station and tells the police about the crazed person. The police calm her down and offer to drive her back to her house (or a safe place in other versions). But when they go with her to get her things from the car, they find the killer hiding behind the driver's seat. As it turns out, the crazed person that was chasing the woman was the ghost of one of the killer's victims, trying to either warn the woman or get at the killer.\n\nThe story is often told with a moral. The attendant is often a lumberjack, a trucker, or a scary-looking man: someone the driver mistrusts without reason. She assumes it is the attendant who wants to do her harm, when in reality it is he who saves her life.\n\n\n\n"}

The last known sighting of her was at a pub in Paderborn's city center, where she and a friend watched the FIFA World Cup match between England and Sweden. While Liebs was still at the pub, she borrowed a friend's mobile phone battery, as the battery on her own phone had been drained. She later returned her friend's battery before leaving the pub at around 11 p.m. Since she probably had no more than five euros with her, she is believed to have been heading home on foot. The pub was about 1.5 kilometers away from her home.\n\nAt 12:49 a.m., her housemate received a text message from Lieb's mobile phone, saying that she would be home later. However, she did not return home that night, and when she also failed to appear at work the day after, her mother reported her missing. The police discovered that the text message had been sent from Nieheim, a small city about 35 km north-east of Paderborn.\n\nIn the following days, Liebs called her housemate five times via her mobile phone. Police were able to locate the calls, which all came from different industrial areas in Paderborn. During these calls, Liebs continued to say that she would return home soon, but did not communicate any information about her situation. She provided only vague or evasive answers to questions. Frauke Liebs' last phone call was on June 27 in the presence of her sister, who also talked to her. During this conversation, Frauke is said to have answered the question of whether she was being held captive with a faint \"yes\", immediately followed by a loud \"no\". Contact broke off after this phone call.\n\nFrauke Liebs' skeletonized body was found by a hunter on October 4, 2006 in a forested area next to a Landesstraße (\"state road\") near Lichtenau. The body was found with the clothes she was wearing on the day of her disappearance. Her mobile phone, handbag, wallet and wrist watch were not found. Due to the advanced state of decomposition, the time and cause of Liebs' death could not be determined.\n\nA case analysis by the police came to the conclusion that Liebs was probably held captive in the area around Nieheim and that the phone calls from Paderborn may have been diversionary maneuvers. No motive for the crime has been determined. Over 900 people who were connected to the victim were questioned by the police, and the initial investigation produced a list of five initial suspects. All five were eventually cleared after producing alibis.\n\nThe case aroused nationwide interest and was among others presented on the popular television show \"Aktenzeichen XY … ungelöst\" (\"Case number XY … Unsolved\").\n\n\n"}

It is a Grade II listed building.\n\nIn 1705 the first theatre opened in Bath. It was on a site which The building by George Trim was small and cramped and made little profit in the years before its demolition in 1738. The site it was on is now the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases. A New Theatre opened in Kingsmead Street in 1723 and operated until 1751.\n\nIn 1747 John Hippisley proposed the construction of a new theatre and a revised version in 1748 just before his death. The planning was taken over by John Palmer, a local brewer and chandler. The site for a new theatre was chosen by John Wood, the Elder, who laid out much of the city, on the site of the old orchard of Bath Abbey. Construction work for the theatre in Old Orchard Street began in 1748, to designs by the architect Thomas Jolly of Hippesley and Watts, with the work being completed by John Powell in 1750. The theatre was long and board. The theatre, known as The St James Theatre, opened on 27 October, under the management of John Palmer, with a performance of William Shakespeare’s Henry IV, Part 2.\n\nPalmer obtained a royal patent in 1768 which enabled the use of the title ‘Theatre Royal’; the first to achieve this outside London. He handed control to his son, also John Palmer who worked as his father's London agent, frequently travelling between London and Bath. Palmer also owned the Theatre Royal, King Street, in Bristol, which now houses the Bristol Old Vic. The two theatres shared one acting company, so Palmer had to move his actors, stagehands and props quickly between Bristol and Bath, he set up a coach service which provided safe, quick and efficient transport for his actors and materials. Later, when Palmer became involved in the Post Office, he believed that the coach service he had previously run between theatres could be utilised for a countrywide mail delivery service. He continued to manage the theatre until 1785 when he was appointed as Comptroller-General of the Post Office, and handed control to two existing members of the company, William Keasberry and William Wyatt Dimond. Keasberry (1726–1797) was associated with the theatre as actor and manager from 1757 to 1795, first acting as manager during the season of 1760.\n\nIn 1772 the young actor John Henderson joined the company and developed into a popular leading man before moving to theaters in London. Sarah Siddons joined the company between 1778 and 1782 and was among many leading actors of the day who performed at the theatre. During these years, the theatre performed an increasing number of plays written by women, and it has been suggested that this was due chiefly to the presence of Siddons in the company, as well as being related to the retirement of David Garrick. In 1791 Robert William Elliston made one of his earliest performances at the theatre.\n\nThe building was used as a theatre until 1805, when the present Theatre Royal opened. In the early years of the 19th century, Jane Austen was familiar with the theatre in Orchard Street, which is believed to be the original of that described in chapter 12 of \"Northanger Abbey\".\n\nAfter four years standing empty the building was converted into a Roman Catholic chapel by the authorities of Prior Park and Downside Abbey and consecrated in 1809. The conversion involved the removal of the stage, gallery and boxes. It was adapted by Henry Goodridge.\n\nAfter the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829 removed many of the restrictions on Roman Catholics which had been introduced by the Act of Uniformity, the chapel became a church and was a site for the ordination of bishops, including Peter Augustine Baines. The vaults which had been used to store scenery was used to create stone tombs with 286 bodies being interred.\n\nThe congregation grew and in the 1850s and early 1860s a new St John's Church was designed and built by Charles Francis Hansom. In 1863 the congregation transferred to St John's Church and most of the bodies which had been in the vaults moved to a new churchyard.\n\nThe building stood empty until 1866 when it and adjacent buildings in Pierrepont Place were acquired by the Masonic Royal Cumberland Lodge No. 53 for £636, to become their meeting hall.\n\nThe building was damaged during the Baedeker Blitz of 1942.\n\nThe hall is now the meeting place of eight Craft Lodges and 15 other Degrees.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25424201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25424201", "title": "Open Christmas Letter", "text": "Open Christmas Letter\n\nThe Open Christmas Letter was a public message for peace addressed \"To the Women of Germany and Austria\", signed by a group of 101 British suffragists at the end of 1914 as the first Christmas of the First World War approached. The Open Christmas Letter was written in acknowledgment of the mounting horror of modern war and as a direct response to letters written to American feminist Carrie Chapman Catt, the president of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA), by a small group of German women's rights activists. Published in January 1915 in \"Jus Suffragii\", the journal of the IWSA, the Open Christmas Letter was answered two months later by a group of 155 prominent German and Austrian women who were pacifists. The exchange of letters between women of nations at war helped promote the aims of peace, and helped prevent the fracturing of the unity which lay in the common goal they shared, suffrage for women.\n\nThe decision by some suffragists to speak out against the war split the women's suffrage movement in the United Kingdom. Most British women were in favour of a quick solution to the conflict and were inclined to work toward that end in any way such as by helping fill positions abandoned by men off at war. Others were nationalistic and sought to make certain that British women were seen as patriotic, as doing their part, so that the men in power would think more highly of them and subsequently pass woman suffrage legislation. A minority of women advocated peace vociferously and worked with international peace organisations or with refugee aid societies. Nearly all suffragists agreed not to disrupt the nation at war in their promotion of women's suffrage. Toward the end of the war partial suffrage was granted, for property-holding women aged 30 and over.\n\nFrom 1906 until mid-1914, the Labour Party in the United Kingdom was the party seen as most supportive of women's suffrage—the right of women to vote. Suffragettes and other women's rights activists organised to elect Labour candidates and to push for legislation that expanded the rights of women. In August 1914 when the world became embroiled in war, the British women activists were sharply divided into two camps: the majority who wished to work with their country's war effort, and a minority who opposed the conflict. Millicent Garrett Fawcett of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS) wished to have the NUWSS members work for the war so that the men in politics would view the women with greater respect and would thus be more amenable to granting them the right to vote. However, the NUWSS membership included those who were against war. When Fawcett turned the NUWSS to war work, eleven pacifist members resigned, later to join the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF).\n\nLike the NUWSS, the more militant Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) led by Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst chose to cease their obstructive activism for women's votes and instead advocated the alignment of British women to the cause of war. However, in October 1914, Sylvia Pankhurst travelled to Glasgow and spoke out against the war, becoming one of the first suffragettes to do so. She said that \"peace must be made by the people and not by the diplomats\". Though pacifist, Pankhurst held with her mother and sister to the general agreement that suffragettes would abstain from militant activism for the duration—she arranged for activist women to join with the War Emergency Worker's Committee and fill some of the positions that had been abandoned by men leaving for war.\n\nIn \"Jus Suffragii\" in December 1914, Carrie Chapman Catt published a letter that she had received earlier from , , and several other German women activists including presidents of woman suffrage societies in Germany. The letter was entitled \"To the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, through its president, Mrs. Chapman Catt.\" It began, \"To the women of all nations warm and hearty greetings in these wretched and bloody times.\" The German women expressed that the \"criminally rekindled war\" should not separate women from all countries who had previously been united \"by the common striving for the highest object—personal and political freedom\". They stated that \"True humanity knows no national hatred, no national contempt. Women are nearer to true humanity than men.\"\n\nCatt published another letter from German women's rights activist Clara Zetkin, one that expressed the desire for all women not to let \"the thunder of guns and the shouts of the jingoes\" make them forget that the rise of civilisation amongst the European countries held much in common. Zetkin wrote that the women of the world should guard their children against the \"hollow din\" of \"cheap racial pride\" which filled the streets, and that \"the blood of dead and wounded must not become a stream to divide what present need and future hope unite\".\n\nIn response to the letters from Germany, Emily Hobhouse organised the writing and signing of a peace-promoting letter from British women: the Open Christmas Letter. In the 1900s, Hobhouse campaigned against and worked to change the appalling conditions inside the British concentration camps in South Africa built for Boer women and children during the Second Boer War. She saw in the German letters the opportunity for maintaining vital international relations among women who could help mitigate the damage that war would bring. She wrote what she called a \"Letter of Christmas Greeting\" in November 1914 and circulated it for signatures of women who wished for peace. Pankhurst and Helen Bright Clark were among the first to sign Hobhouse's plea for continued sisterhood among the women of the world.\n\nOthers among the 101 signers were Margaret Ashton, Margaret Bondfield, Eva Gore-Booth, Esther Roper, Maude Royden, Helena Swanwick, and a wide range of women united by the wish for \"undiminished sisterly relations\" and a swift end to hostilities. Included among the women were some who were members of the Women's Labour League, and some of the Independent Labour Party. One of the listed women was \"Mrs. M. K. Gandhi\" but it is unknown whether Kasturba Gandhi, the wife of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, asked that her name be included. At least one of the signers was an American: Florence Edgar Hobson was the New York-born wife of English Liberal social theorist and economist John A. Hobson.\n\nUnder the heading \"On Earth Peace, Goodwill towards Men\", the letter's salutation addressed \"Sisters\" and began, \"Some of us wish to send you a word at this sad Christmastide, though we can but speak through the Press...\" The women of the UK were prevented from direct communication with the women of Germany because of the war. Instead, they sent their missive to America which was at that time a neutral nation. The letter continued, \"The Christmas message sounds like mockery to a world at war, but those of us who wished and still wish for peace may surely offer a solemn greeting to such of you who feel as we do.\" The letter mentioned that, as in South Africa during the Second Boer War (1899–1902) and in the Balkan Wars of 1912–1913, \"the brunt of modern war falls upon non-combatants, and the conscience of the world cannot bear the sight\".\n\nIs it not our mission to preserve life? Do not humanity and common sense alike prompt us to join hands with the women of neutral countries, and urge our rulers to stay further bloodshed? ...Even through the clash of arms, we treasure our poet's vision, and already seem to hear     \"A hundred nations swear that there shall be     Pity and Peace and Love among the good and free.\"May Christmas hasten that day...\n\nIn the spring of 1915, the letter was answered in kind by 155 Germanic feminists including Augspurg and Heymann who had sent the earlier letter from Germany. Margarethe Lenore Selenka, Minna Cauer, and Helene Stöcker were among the German signers; Rosa Mayreder, Marianne Fickert, Ernestine Federn, and were in the group of Austrian signers. The response was entitled \"Open Letter in Reply to the Open Christmas Letter from Englishwomen to German\nand Austrian Women\" and was published in \"Jus Suffragii\" on 1 March 1915. The letter began:\n\nTo our English sisters, sisters of the same race, we express in the name of many German women our warm and heartfelt thanks for their Christmas greetings, which we only heard of lately.This message was a confirmation of what we foresaw—that women of the belligerent countries, with all faithfulness, devotion, and love to their country, can go beyond it and maintain true solidarity with the women of other belligerent nations, and that really civilised women never lose their humanity...\n\nDirectly after war broke out in August 1914, Rosika Schwimmer, a native of Austria–Hungary working in England but prevented by war from returning home, outlined her idea for an international conference of neutrals to mediate between warring nations. In September 1914, , president of the German Union for Woman Suffrage, wrote to Carrie Chapman Catt in America with \"deep personal regret\" for the \"terrible war\" to say that the women of Germany must withdraw their invitation to the annual IWSA International Alliance meeting in June 1915 which was to convene in Berlin. In December 1914 Julia Grace Wales, a professor at the University of Wisconsin, expanded eloquently on the concept, and published her views in a pamphlet entitled \"Continuous Mediation Without Armistice\", popularly known as the Wisconsin Plan. Taking these messages as her inspiration, Catt proposed that, instead of holding a woman suffrage convention in Berlin, an international peace congress of women should meet in The Hague for four days beginning 28 April 1915.\n\nWhen this announcement reached the UK, the NUWSS was divided on the one hand by patriots such as Fawcett and on the other by the signers of the Christmas letter who wished to send peace delegates. However, the majority of the NUWSS were nationalistic more than they were peace-minded—they were primarily concerned with helping the UK men win the war. The NUWSS membership rejected a resolution favoured by Helen Bright Clark and Margaret Bondfield which would have supported a delegation of women at The Hague. Because of this, Margaret Ashton resigned from the NUWSS and was subsequently censured by her local Manchester branch of suffragists. As well, Helena Swanwick and Maude Royden resigned from the NUWSS and made plans to attend at The Hague.\n\nAt The Hague, between 28 April and 1 May 1915, a large congress of 1,150 women from North America and Europe gathered to discuss peace proposals. The event was called the International Congress of Women, or the Women's Peace Congress. A planned contingent of 180 British women was greatly reduced to just three persons by the government cancellation of British ferry service across the English Channel, stranding Royden and Swanwick, among others. Having already travelled to Flushing, Netherlands on a mission of mercy in late October 1914 to provide food for refugees from the fall of Antwerp, Chrystal Macmillan was able to attend the women's conference and speak for the UK. Macmillan, a signer of the Open Christmas Letter, had previously resigned from the NUWSS when its refusal to stand against the war had become clear. Macmillan was selected as one of the international committee who would travel to neutral nations and champion the proposal of the Congress. The Wisconsin Plan was unanimously adopted as the optimum method for returning peace to the world, and Macmillan, Schwimmer and the committee travelled to the neutral US to present President Woodrow Wilson with the plan. Many of the women's peace proposals were used by Wilson in his Fourteen Points, and the women's efforts helped encourage the later founding of the League of Nations.\n\nDuring the war, with British suffragists abstaining from taking militant action, British statesmen such as Prime Minister H. H. Asquith began to have a change of heart regarding their right to vote. In early 1917 a clause which provided suffrage for property-holding women aged 30 years and older was debated, and in June it was attached to the bill which would later become the Representation of the People Act 1918. Suffragists who were pacifists and suffragists who were nationalistic could both congratulate themselves for winning this incremental victory. Ten years later full voting equality with men was achieved in the UK with the Representation of the People Act 1928.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Rolling blackouts are a last-resort measure used by an electric utility company to avoid a total blackout of the power system. They are a type of demand response for a situation where the demand for electricity exceeds the power supply capability of the network. Rolling blackouts may be localised to a specific part of the electricity network or may be more widespread and affect entire countries and continents. Rolling blackouts generally result from two causes: insufficient generation capacity or inadequate transmission infrastructure to deliver sufficient power to the area where it is needed.\n\nRolling blackouts are a common or even a normal daily event in many developing countries where electricity generation capacity is underfunded or infrastructure is poorly managed. In well managed under-capacity systems, blackouts are scheduled in advance and advertised to allow people to work around them, but in most cases they happen without warning, typically whenever the transmission frequency falls below the 'safe' limit. Rolling blackouts are also used as a response strategy to cope with reduced output beyond reserve capacity from power stations taken offline unexpectedly such as through an extreme weather event.\n\nRolling blackouts in developed countries sometimes occur due to economic forces at the expense of system reliability (such as in the California electricity crisis of 2000-2001).\n"}

{"id": "11512204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11512204", "title": "Second Hundred Years' War", "text": "Second Hundred Years' War\n\nThe Second Hundred Years' War (c. 1689 – c. 1815) is a periodization or historical era term used by some historians to describe the series of military conflicts between Great Britain and France that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815. For the context see International relations, 1648–1814.\n\nThe Second Hundred Years' War is named after the Hundred Years War, when the rivalry between England and France began in the 14th century. The term appears to have been coined by J. R. Seeley in his influential work \"The Expansion of England: Two Courses of Lectures\" (1883).\n\nLike the Hundred Years' War, this term does not describe a single military event but a persistent general state of war between the two primary belligerents. The use of the phrase as an overarching category indicates the interrelation of all the wars as components of the rivalry between France and Britain for world power. It was a war between and over the future of each state's colonial empires.\n\nThe two countries remained continual antagonists even as their national identities underwent significant evolution. Great Britain was not a single state until 1707, prior to which it was the separate kingdoms of England and Scotland, albeit with a shared Crown and military establishment. In 1801, Britain was united with the Kingdom of Ireland to form the United Kingdom. The period also saw France under the Bourbon dynasty, the regimes of the French Revolution and the First Empire.\n\nThe various wars between the two states during the 18th century usually involved other European countries in large alliances; except for the War of the Quadruple Alliance when they were bound by the Anglo-French Alliance, France and Britain always opposed one another. Some of the wars, such as the Seven Years' War, have been considered world wars and included battles in the growing colonies in India, the Americas, and ocean shipping routes around the globe.\n\nThe series of wars began with the accession of the Dutch William III as King of England in the Revolution of 1688. His predecessors the Stuarts had sought friendly terms with Louis XIV: James I and Charles I, both Protestants, had avoided involvement as much as possible in the Thirty Years' War, while Charles II and the Catholic convert James II had even actively supported Louis XIV in his War against the Dutch Republic. William III, however, sought to oppose Louis XIV's Catholic regime and styled himself as a Protestant champion. Tensions continued in the following decades, during which France protected Jacobites who sought to overthrow the later Stuarts and, after 1715, the Hanoverians.\n\nAfter William III, the opposition of France and Britain shifted from religion to economy and trade: the two nations vied for colonial domination in the Americas and Asia. The Seven Years' War was one of the greatest and most decisive conflicts. France's alliance and backing of the colonists in the American Revolutionary War against Britain was successful in undermining British colonial hegemony in North America, but in turn debts from that conflict sowed the economic seeds of France's own revolution shortly thereafter.\n\nThe French military rivalry continued with British opposition of the French Revolution and the ensuing wars with first the new French Republic and then the Empire of Napoleon. His defeat in 1814 was followed by his abdication and exile, but he escaped the following year to begin the Hundred Days. These came to a close with his military disaster at the Battle of Waterloo, facing an Allied force commanded by the Duke of Wellington. The end of the Napoleonic Wars effectively ended the recurrent conflict between France and Britain. However, Britain and her allies' goal of restoring the French Bourbon monarchy in the Treaty of Paris and the subsequent Congress of Vienna, which sought to prevent further revolutions in Europe, ultimately failed with the later Revolutions of 1848.\n\nThe recurrent rhetoric used in each country shifted from references to a \"natural enemy\" to an agreement to tolerate one another. Common interests led the two to cooperate in the Crimean War of the 1850s. A century after fighting one another (and with the mutual interest in checking the growing power of a united Germany, aside from Austria, with its Empire), the two were able to establish the Entente Cordiale by 1904, demonstrating that the \"First\" and \"Second\" Hundred Years' Wars were in the past; cultural differences continued, but violent conflict was over.\n\nMany in Europe referred to Great Britain as \"Perfidious Albion\", suggesting that it was a fundamentally untrustworthy nation. People compared Britain and France to ancient Carthage and Rome, respectively, with the former being cast as a greedy imperialist state that collapsed, while the latter was an intellectual and cultural capital that flourished:\nThe republicans knew as well as the Bourbons that British control of the oceans weighed in Continental power politics, and that France could not dominate Europe without destroying Britain. \"Carthage\"—vampire, tyrant of the seas, \"perfidious\" enemy and bearer of a corrupting commercial civilization—contrasted with \"Rome\", bearer of universal order, philosophy and selfless values.\n\n\n\n"}

It marks the final regular television appearance of Anthony Ainley as the Master and of Sophie Aldred as Ace. It is also the last regular television appearance of Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor.\n\nIn the serial, the alien time traveller Master kidnaps humans from contemporary Perivale, and uses the teenager Midge (Will Barton) to facilitate his escape from the disintegrating planet of the Cheetah People.\n\nThe Seventh Doctor brings Ace back home to Perivale in west London. The suburb is not as it should be: a mysterious black cat is wandering around, somehow creating a situation in which humans are hunted down and made to disappear to another dimension. Ace becomes worried when most of her old friends seem to have disappeared, but the Doctor is more preoccupied with the behaviour of the strange cat. It becomes apparent the black cat is being controlled by a strange being in the other dimension, viewing the scenes in Perivale through the cat's eyes and choosing which humans to chase and transport. An unhappy young man called Stuart becomes his next victim. Ace follows soon afterwards, hunted down by a Cheetah Person on horseback, which seems to have a hunting affinity with the curious cat. Later the Doctor and a keep-fit instructor called Paterson are chosen and teleported to another world, bathed in a blood-red sky, where the Doctor is greeted by his nemesis the Master.\nThe renegade is evidently unwell, his eyes and mouth displaying feline characteristics, and is using the black cat (or kitling) to create a dimensional bridge for the Cheetah People to hunt prey on Earth. He tells the Doctor that the planet is alive and has a bewitching influence; the indigenous population bred the kitlings and had a great civilisation, but they regressed into animals through the power of the planet. He too is beginning to show changes and needs the Doctor's help to escape from the planet.\n\nAce has meanwhile made contact with some of her friends, Shreela and Midge, who are hiding in some woods with a young man called Derek. The planet is evidently dangerous as both Stuart and a terrified milkman find out when a Cheetah Person hunts him to the death. Ace and her friends soon find the Doctor and Paterson, and the Doctor has deduced they are on a very ancient planet, which is dying. A Cheetah pack then attacks and during the fight back Midge kills one Cheetah while Ace injures another, called Karra. She begins to form an attachment to Karra and nurses her, tending her injuries, which worries the Doctor greatly. In time Ace's eyes change and she begins to transform into a Cheetah herself. She abandons the Doctor to go hunting with Karra but he eventually wins her round.\n\nMidge has meanwhile completely fallen to the power of the planet and is turning into an animal. The Master seizes on this and uses Midge to teleport them both back to Earth and away from the dying world. The Doctor persuades Ace to help him get back to Perivale and she does so, also enabling Paterson, Derek and Shreela to flee the strange planet. Paterson denies anything amiss has taken place, falling back on his \"survival of the fittest\" mantras and his self-defence classes. The Doctor and Ace now head around Perivale in search of Midge and the Master. They eventually find them at the youth club, where they have killed Paterson for sport, and Midge too is killed in the Master's machinations. Karra's arrival brings comfort to Ace, whose transformation is continuing, but the Master kills Karra too.\n\nThe Master transports the Doctor with him back to the Cheetah Planet for a final conflict but the Doctor resists the pull of the planet, turning away from violence, and is transported away from the dying world. However, the Master looks doomed on the planet as it begins to break up. The Doctor has gone back to the TARDIS and Earth, where he finds Ace, whose metamorphosis has reversed, and tells her she will have grown through the experience: the element of the Cheetah Planet, however, will remain within her forever and they return to the TARDIS.\n\nDuring the scenes in Midge's flat, Ace grabs \"War\", an album by rock band U2, and says \"are they still going?\".\n\nWriter Rona Munro approached script editor Andrew Cartmel at a BBC scriptwriting workshop and said that she'd \"kill to write for \"Doctor Who\".\" The story Munro developed incorporated themes including the morals of hunting (personified by the Cheetah People and signposted by Ace's friend Ange collecting for hunt saboteurs). Working titles for the story included \"Cat-Flap\" and \"Blood Hunt\". The title \"Survival\" was chosen by Cartmel. Munro was disappointed by the realisation of the Cheetah People:\n\n\"Survival\" was one of only three \"Doctor Who\" serials to be recorded completely on BBC Outside Broadcast video, instead of the mix of OB and studio video that was more common during the late 1980s, and the mix of film and video that was usual before them. The other stories to be recorded solely on OB video were \"The Sontaran Experiment\" (1975) and the previous story \"The Curse of Fenric\" (1989).\n\nIt was almost on the shooting days for the scenes on the planet of the Cheetah people. One of the extras removed her costume (revealing that she was wearing very little underneath) and simply walked off the set, causing delays while a replacement was found. The battle at the climax of the story was recorded and is set on the site of the ancient hill fort at Horsenden Hill, Perivale. The majority of location recording was done in and around Perivale, with small sections shot at nearby Ealing, outside and near The Drayton Court pub.\n\nHaving already surmised that episode three of \"Survival\" was likely to at least be the last episode of \"Doctor Who\" for some time, and possibly the last ever, the programme's producer John Nathan-Turner decided close to transmission that a more suitable conclusion should be given to the final episode. To this end, script editor Andrew Cartmel wrote a short, melancholic closing monologue for actor Sylvester McCoy, which McCoy recorded on 23 November 1989, the day after Episode 1 was broadcast, and also by coincidence, the show's twenty-sixth anniversary:\n\n\"There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream. People made of smoke, and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there’s injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace — we’ve got work to do!\"\n\nThis was dubbed over the closing scene as the Doctor and Ace walked off into the distance, apparently to further adventures. The \"Doctor Who\" production office at the BBC finally closed down in August 1990, having been in continuous operation since 1963.\n\nAlthough \"Survival\" was the last \"Doctor Who\" serial of the original series to be transmitted, it was not the last to have been produced; that was \"Ghost Light\", which had been broadcast some weeks earlier, as the antepenultimate story of the original run.\n\nThis story is the last to feature Anthony Ainley as the Master. Ainley was not asked to return as the Master for the 1996 \"Doctor Who\" television movie. Instead, Gordon Tipple was cast as the Master for the prologue and Eric Roberts played the Master for the rest of the movie. Ainley reprised the role of the Master for the 1997 computer game \"Destiny of the Doctors\". He continued to be active in \"Doctor Who\", attending conventions and recording a commentary track for the DVD of the 1981 serial \"The Keeper of Traken\". Ainley died in May 2004.\n\nThis story was also the last to entirely feature Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor. McCoy returned briefly to the role at the beginning of the 1996 \"Doctor Who\" television movie to regenerate into the Eighth Doctor (played by Paul McGann).\n\nFinally, this story was the last to feature Sophie Aldred as Ace. Aldred would have continued in her role had the series been renewed for Season 27; however, Aldred's contract was set to expire at the middle part of that season. As a result, the character of Ace was set to be written out of the series in an Ice Warrior story called \"Ice Time\" (1990) by Marc Platt. According to various interviews with the production team, the new companion would have been a female safecracker whom the Doctor would have taken under his wing, with her gangster father as a recurring character. For details on \"Doctor Who\" during the 1990s, see History of Doctor Who.\n\nBoth McCoy and Aldred would play their characters on screen for the BBC on two occasions after \"Survival\" was broadcast: first in a 1990 episode of the schools and colleges series \"Search Out Science\" and once more in 1993, along with many other former \"Doctor Who\" actors, in \"Dimensions in Time\", a benefit for Children in Need. The two actors reprised their roles in officially licensed audio productions for Big Finish starting in 1999, and again in 2001 for the BBC webcast production, \"Death Comes to Time\".\n\n\"Doctor Who\" eventually returned to production as a BBC television series in 2004, produced by BBC Wales. \"Rose\", the first episode of the new series, aired on 26 March 2005. As the new series is produced as 45-minute episodes, this makes \"Survival\" the final serial to date to be produced in 25-minute instalments, which had been the standard for the series (except for a one-season experiment with 45-minute episodes in 1985) since 1963. This story was also the last to feature the face of the current Doctor in the title sequence, a tradition dating back to \"The Macra Terror\" of 1967, until the 2012 Christmas Special and the second part of the 7th series. Both the TV Movie that followed this, and the revived series of 2005 until September 2012, had title sequences featuring a \"time tunnel\" effect, differing in style from time to time. This effect actually served in-universe as the time-vortex.\n\nThe part of Karra in this serial is played by Lisa Bowerman, who is now more familiar to fans as the voice of Bernice Summerfield in the Big Finish Productions audio dramas. She is also a director of many Big Finish productions, and also returned to the \"Doctor Who\" series proper when she provided voice-acting work for the animated special \"Dreamland\" in 2009.\n\nThis serial features guest appearances of the comedians Gareth Hale and Norman Pace, and actress Adele Silva (as an 8-year old, in her first television role). See also Celebrity appearances in Doctor Who.\n\nThere was no direct indication given to the public that this was to be the final regular installment of \"Doctor Who\"; however, unlike previous years' final episodes, this one featured no announcement in the closing credits that the programme would return the following year.\n\nReviewing \"Survival\", David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described it as \"a very good story\", with a\nscript that contains \"highly imaginative and original concepts\". They also expressed admiration for the special effects used for the Cheetah People's planet, \ncalling them \"superb electronic video effects\". Ainley's performance was also praised, with the reviewers\nstating it was \"deadly serious and implacably evil, but with occasional flashes of dark humour\". \nWhile stating that it was \"deeply regrettable\" that the original series of \"Doctor Who\" had to end with \"Survival\", they added \"that it went out on such a high note is, however, something to be thankful for\".\n\nThe serial was also positively received by Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, who praised Anthony Ainley's performance and considered the show to be \"A great end to the series\" with \"an epic quality\".\n\nA novelisation of this serial, written by Rona Munro, was published by Target Books in October 1990, making Munro the third woman to write a \"Doctor Who\" novelisation. A reprint edition was one of several possible books included with a 2007 issue of Doctor Who Magazine.\n\n\"Survival\" was released on VHS in October 1995. It was released on DVD on 16 April 2007 as a 2-disc set. This serial was released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files collection, in issue 51, published 15 December 2010.\n\nThe music from this serial composed by Dominic Glynn was first released on CD 15 September 2017.\n\n\n\n"}

The practice was introduced to the region by the Shi'ite Muslim \"sepoy\" troops from India who were stationed—and later settled—there during the British Raj.\n\nThe festival includes reenactments of the Battle of Karbala, and the playing of tassa and dhol drums. Although originally a Shi'a festival, nowadays most inhabitants of Pariaman and other southeastern Asia areas hold similar festivals which are even celebrated by non-Muslims.\n\nThe remembrance is referred to as \"Tabut\" or \"Tabot\" in Indonesian. (Tabut is the name given in the Quran for The Ark of the Covenant.) In preparation for the ceremony, one or more tabuiks are made from bamboo, rattan, and paper. During the week of Tabuik, activities include kite races, traditional plays, and dance expositions (such as the \"Tari Piring\"). The memorial draws a large crowd including dignitaries such as the provincial governor. Visitors and celebrants can observe the tabuik in the morning before it is slowly taken to the beach in a procession. At noon the tabuik is thrown into the sea. Afterwards, many people go swimming creating 'memories' of the tabuik to keep.\n\n\n"}

It's starting point and its iconic motif was a Tahitian tivaevae featuring the Genesis story of the 'Dream of Joseph' or \"Te moemoea no Iotefa\". The exhibition initially filled all spaces of the historic Sarjeant Gallery building, an earlier version of the Wellington City Art Gallery and the entire first floor of the Auckland Art Gallery. In the exhibition catalogue Panoho outlined the South Pacific as, 'Aotearoa's most immediate historical, geographical and cultural context', and that he was seeking to 'examine and explore the visual side of this context and the ways in which artists in this country are exploring it'. The exhibition brought together four strands of art making:\n\n1. The wealth of material culture from the Pacific Islands found in museums, libraries, private collections - taonga such as historical writing, photographs, tapa, tivaevae, weaving and carving.\n\n2. Work currently being produced by Pacific Islanders living in New Zealand such as tivaevae and carving.\n\n3. Work by palagi artists in this country (e.g. Fomison, Shepherd, Lynn, Lett, Hanly, McMillan, Adams, and Jowitt) which constitutes a response to Pacific Island subject and motif.\n\n4. Work by contemporary Pacific artists utilising a Western aesthetic - to draw on and interpret their particular island cultures.\n\nThe exhibition 'wove together the various aspects of Pacific culture as it persists in Aotearoa'. Art historian Nicholas Thomas writes 'Museum artifacts were placed with contemporary art, folk crafts with paintings, archive photographs with contemporary images, and Pacific artists among white appropriators of culture'.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue contains interviews with 10 contemporary artists included in the show:\n\n\nTe Moemoea was also an exploration of Pacificness as it more diversely related to broader creative activity in Aotearoa. As curator Panoho was not exclusively looking at contemporary Pacific art. As with his show 'Whatu Aho Rua' (1989/1992 - another Sarjeant exhibition involving historical and contemporary material) he was also interested in historical Pacific collections of tapa, fibre, photography and carving and in how non-Pacific artists were working with Pacific communities and in how they were interpreting the material and the ideas that they valorised. Te Moemoea while initiated from within a regional institution travelled to and was reinvented by Panoho and gallery staff within the Whanganui, Wellington and Auckland gallery spaces. A newspaper review from Wellington helps clarify the complexity and the layered nature of the content within Te Moemoea: \"'Cross-currents crackle around the latest exhibition at Wellington's City Gallery. People who like to keep art in neat pigeonholes... will probably find Te Moemoea no Iotefa (Joseph's dream defeats them. Rangihīroa Panoho...has curated a lively exhibition which aims to be a lot more than a showcase for artists with a Pacific Island background who are working in New Zealand. It is that, but it's also a visual essay about cross-fertilisation\".' \n\n\"Te Moemoea no Iotefa\" has been described as 'the first group exhibition to celebrate the dynamism of Pacific art'.\n\nPacific art historian Peter Brunt saw Te Moemoea as, \"'The first exhibition to focus on contemporary Pacific art in a civic gallery in New Zealand was Te Moemoea no Iotefa '[the Dream of Joseph: A Celebration of Pacific Art and Taonga]...The exhibition thematized the presence of Pacific culture in New Zealand society, introduced community-based arts like tivaevae into the contemporary gallery, and canvassed the work of migrant artists like Fatu Feu'u, Johnny Penisula, Michel Tuffery and others, only then beginning to garner serious public attention. But it was the title that was the most prescient about its own historical significance. The title was borrowed from the title of a tivaevae it showed, and refers to the biblical story of Joseph sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers, eventually to rise to a position of power in the Pharoah's court. Joseph's dream turns out to be an allegory of the moment of recognition when, as an exile, he reveals himself to his brothers as the important person he has become. The ambiguity of the allegory lies in the question of whether recognition in Egypt or escape from Egypt (if we can pardon the Orientalism) is the preferable goal\".' \n\nThe exhibition contributed to a sense of group identification amongst a group of young or emerging artists, including Ioane, Tuffery, Laita and John Pule.The exhibition is seen as an important precursor to Bottled Ocean, a 1994 exhibition focused on the work of contemporary Pacific artists.\n\nArt historian Karen Stevenson notes the importance of the exhibition in building the careers of participating artists:\n\nWith the success of \"Te Moemoea no Iotefa\", Pacific artists found exhibition space more readily available, and as recognition of Pacific artists grew, dealer galleries and community centers became interested in hosting \"Pacific\" exhibitions. Group \"Pacific\" shows became regular occurrences in art galleries throughout the country, as did solo exhibitions at dealer galleries.\"\n"}

{"id": "6058257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6058257", "title": "The Masked Marauders", "text": "The Masked Marauders\n\nThe Masked Marauders is a record album released on the Warner Bros Reprise/Deity label in the fall of 1969 that was part of an elaborate hoax concocted by \"Rolling Stone\" magazine.\n\nIn its October 18, 1969 issue, \"Rolling Stone\" ran a tongue-in-cheek review of a non-existent album that purportedly captured a \"super session\" of the era's leading rock and roll musicians, including Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, John Lennon, and Paul McCartney. The review claimed that none of the artists could be listed on the jacket cover because of contractual agreements with their recording companies. The editors involved decided to extend the joke by hiring a relatively obscure band to record an actual album and then secured a deal with Warner Bros. As an indication of how many people were taken in by the joke, \"The Masked Marauders\" reached No. 114 on \"Billboard's\" album chart.\n\n\"The Masked Marauders\" began as a spoof dreamed up by \"Rolling Stone\" editor Greil Marcus. Under the pseudonym T.M. Christian (a reference to Terry Southern’s novel \"The Magic Christian\"), Marcus wrote a satiric review of a fictitious double bootleg album in collaboration with record reviewer Bruce Miroff. The review was intended to parody the \"supergroup\" trend then taking place (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, Blind Faith and Led Zeppelin) and was also inspired by \"Great White Wonder\", a double album of unreleased Dylan recordings often credited as the first bootleg.\nMany readers, however, took the review seriously, despite its obvious jokes:\n\n\nEnquiries began pouring into \"Rolling Stone\" regarding the album’s availability, not only from fans and retailers, but reportedly from the artists' managers, Allen Klein (Beatles and Rolling Stones) and Albert Grossman (Dylan). The response sparked part two of the put-on: the album itself. Marcus and \"Rolling Stone\" editor Langdon Winner recruited the Cleanliness and Godliness Skiffle Band, a Berkeley, California, group which had an album the previous year on Vanguard Records and played frequently at San Francisco’s Fillmore and Avalon ballrooms. The group initially recorded three of the songs cited in the review: the \"Nashville Skyline\"-inspired instrumental \"Cow Pie\", Jagger doing \"I Can’t Get No Nookie\" (deemed \"an instant classic\"), and Dylan’s \"Duke of Earl\".\n\nAfter the songs aired on San Francisco and Los Angeles radio stations – from tapes Marcus supplied – the pranksters began looking for a major label to produce an album. Several recording companies expressed an interest, but Warner Bros. won the production rights, offering a $15,000 advance plus its considerable promotional power. In November 1969, Warner released \"The Masked Marauders\" as a single LP on its newly created Deity label. The album, which sold more than 100,000 copies, spent 12 weeks on the \"Billboard\" album chart, peaking at No. 114. The single \"Cow Pie\" appeared on the Bubbling Under the Hot 100 chart at No. 123 for one week on November 29, 1969.\n\nTipping off buyers to the joke (albeit after they had purchased the album), Warner inserted the \"Rolling Stone\" review as well as a \"San Francisco Chronicle\" column by critic Ralph J. Gleason, a co-founder of \"Rolling Stone\". Gleason found it incredible anyone believed the review and declared the gag a \"delightful bit of instant mythology.\" The closing track, \"Saturday Night at the Cow Palace,\" also made clear the album was all in fun. The track featured a riotous monologue by a record buyer so indignant at being taken in by the hoax that he vows, \"When I get through with those people at Deity Records, I’ll have them walking out of the building in barrels.\" The album’s liner notes, penned by \"T.M. Christian,\" also offered its share of clues, most notably the line:\n\n\"In a world of sham, the Masked Marauders, bless their hearts, are the genuine article.\"\n\nIn 2003, Rhino Records, under its Handmade label, remastered the album, releasing a numbered edition of 2,000 copies entitled \"The Masked Marauders - The Complete Deity Recordings\". The lineup of songs is the same as on the original LP, except for bonus tracks of the monaural single, \"I Can’t Get No Nookie\" b/w \"Cow Pie\". The title of the re-issue posed yet another joke: the album was Deity’s only recording. As one of its contributions to the spoof, Warner created Deity under its Reprise subsidiary to match the name of the non-existent record company credited in the \"Rolling Stone\" review.\n\nThe story of \"The Masked Marauders\" hoax was featured in an April 5, 2013, segment of the TV program \"Rock Center with Brian Williams\".\n\n\n\n\nAs listed on the Rhino Handmade CD release:\n\n\n"}

It debuted at Chichester in 1970 and later at the Piccadilly Theatre London. Principal actors were \nSarah Miles and Eileen Atkins. The play was directed by Peter Dews and designed by Carl Toms. Richard Pearson also played a role. Later, the play had a successful run on Broadway in 1972.\n\nThe play tells the story of two rival monarchs who never met: Scotland's Mary, Queen of Scots and her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I of England. The play's title is Latin for \"Long live! Long live the Queen!\", and is taken from the acclamation at the Coronation Service.\n\nThe first act contrasts the personalities of the two monarchs, as they engage in a battle of wiles. Elizabeth is portrayed as a woman who has given up on love and family in order to maintain a firm grasp on power, while Mary is portrayed as a reckless, impulsive woman ready to risk power for love.\n\nThe second act concentrates on Mary's term as a prisoner of Elizabeth, during which time she reflected on her own pending execution.\n\nEileen Atkins played Elizabeth in the play's British and American debuts. Bolt's wife Sarah Miles played Mary in the original British production, while Claire Bloom played Mary in the play's Broadway debut.

{"id": "34523143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34523143", "title": "Wagner Dream", "text": "Wagner Dream\n\nWagner Dream is an opera by Jonathan Harvey, premiered in 2007, to a libretto by Jean-Claude Carrière, which intertwines events on the last day of the life of Richard Wagner with elements from a fragmentary opera sketch by Wagner himself, \"Die Sieger\" (\"The Victors\").\n\n\"Die Sieger\" was drafted between 1856 and 1858, at a period when Wagner had become greatly interested in Buddhism. It is based on legends which Wagner discovered in Eugène Burnouf's 1844 \"Introduction to the History of Buddhism\". Wagner planned a production of this work for 1870 in his programme for King Ludwig II of Bavaria but never progressed it – (however elements of the story persist in his opera \"Parsifal\"). \n\nHarvey described some of the processes he used in creating \"Wagner Dream\". These include the use of a French horn and a sampled trombone playing deep notes at the opera's commencement, representing boat sirens on the Grand Canal. The composer also visited Chamonix to sample a thunderclap, used to preface an argument between Wagner and his wife.\n\nThe story tells of the love of the outcast chandala Prakriti for the monk Ananda. Although both are ostracized by the other monks, Buddha permits their chaste union and allows Prakriti to join the monastic community. \"Wagner Dream\" intersperses the Prakriti/Ananda story with the events surrounding Wagner's death in Venice. As Wagner dies from a heart attack, he recalls the opera he never completed. Whilst the \"Indian\" roles are all sung, the members of the Wagner household, including his wife Cosima and the soprano Carrie Pringle (with whom it has been alleged that Wagner had his last love affair) are spoken roles. The score uses electronic music as well as an ensemble of 24 musicians.\n\nThe opera was premiered at the Grand Théâtre de Luxembourg in April 2007, prior to a run at the Westergasfabriek, Amsterdam, in a production by Pierre Audi for De Nederlandse Opera, which commissioned the work. Its British premiere took place at the Barbican Centre as a concert performance in London on 29 January 2012. The first British staged performance was given on 6 June 2013 in the Wales Millennium Centre Cardiff by Welsh National Opera, directed by Pierre Audi. In this production, German was used for the spoken text while the Buddhist characters sang in Pali. In a programme note, WNO's artistic director, David Pountney, stated that this change was discussed with Jonathan Harvey with the aim of \"seeking to enhance and clarify the cultural dialogue which is the centrepiece of (Harvey's) opera\".\n\n\n"}
