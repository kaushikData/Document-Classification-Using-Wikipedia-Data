The fairgrounds are located approximately one hour north of Anchorage and draw visitors from the entire Municipality of Anchorage and beyond for the popular 1 and ½ week event beginning at the end of August. The fair is famous for its record setting giant vegetables and picturesque location at the foot of the Chugach Mountains in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. The event features amusement rides, food concessions, competitive exhibits, carnival games, live performances and more.\n\nThe first Alaska State Fair was held September 4–7, 1936. It was organized by members of the Northland Pioneer Grange No. 1, an agricultural fraternal organization, that was organized in the Matanuska Valley in 1933. Planning for the Fair began in 1935 and coincided with establishment of the Matanuska Colony, a New Deal resettlement community designed to assist out of work Midwestern families. In establishing a colony in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley it was the U.S. government's intent to decrease Alaska's reliance on imported food, increase the Territory's population, and give Midwestern families on public assistance a new start.\n\nThat first year’s Fair was held in the community center of the newly established Matanuska Colony and included the crowning of the Fair queen, a baby show, boxing matches, horse races, dances, a rodeo and baseball games. There were also agricultural entries, including giant cabbages, grain, carrots, onions, celery, peas and other vegetables.\n\nDuring World War II, the Fair took a five-year hiatus from 1942 to 1946. But the Fair was back in operation in 1947. 1950 saw the first carnival rides at the Fair. In 1956, the Fair Board petitioned the Alaska Legislature for official designation as the Alaska State Fair. In 1960, the Fair celebrated its 25th anniversary and was paid a visit by President John F. Kennedy.\n\n1967 was the Fair’s first year in its present 300-acre location at 2075 Glenn Highway in Palmer. The total attendance that year reached 72,000. Over the years, Fair attendance has continued its upward trend. During the 18-day Fair in 1998, a record 361,804 people participated in the event. That same year, the Fair accepted 10,890 exhibit entries – the highest on record. The Fair set another record in 2003, with 312,419 visitors attending the Fair over a 12-day period.\n\nFairground facilities have also continued to grow. In 1975, the Fair became home to Colony Village, which preserves some of the historic buildings from the Valley’s early days. In 1997, the construction of Pioneer Plaza and Raven Hall was completed. In 2004, the Fair opened its new Green Gate and Railroad Depot.\n\nIn 2010, it was estimated a total of 290,119 people attended the Fair, which featured 8,081 exhibit entries and 450 vendors.\n\nAlso in 2010, Valley resident and protester Sidney Hill was arrested for fourth-degree assault, disorderly conduct and trespassing after he caused a disturbance on the fairgrounds while carrying a large political sign. The incident was addressed on the Fair blog, and subsequent articles regarding Mr. Hill’s activities were published in the Anchorage Daily News and The Frontiersman.\n\nTaken from internal Alaska State Fair financials.\n\nSituated in the heart of the fertile Matanuska-Susitna Valley, the Fair features giant vegetable exhibits, like 2010’s pending world record-breaking 46-foot (14 m), 8-inch (20 cm) gourd vine, and the state record-breaking 39-inch (100 cm) bean, 83-inch (210 cm) gourd and 1,101-pound (500 kg) pumpkin.\n\nThe Fair’s giant cabbage contest tradition began in 1941, when a $25 prize was offered for the largest cabbage and Max Sherrod of the Valley took the prize with a 23 pounder (10.5 kg). The official Giant Cabbage Weigh-Off was established in 1995. In 2012, grower Scott Robb entered a 138.25 pound (63 kg) cabbage, which not only took first place, but also set a new world record.\n\nIn 2007, the Fair’s flowers and gardens received some national recognition, when the makers of the Public Broadcasting Service program GardenSMART visited the Fair to film a 30-minute segment.\n\nTopping the list of fairgoer favorites is Fair food. Nearly 70 food vendors are scheduled to attend the 2011 Fair, offering staples like hot dogs, pizza, burgers and nachos, to more exotic selections including gyros, Alaska seafood and all kinds of food on a stick, to desserts like ice cream, cream puffs and more. More than 400 non-food vendors are also present at the Fair each year.\n\nThe Fair also features thousands of exhibits, in categories including art, baked goods, canning, clay arts, crops, fiber and fleece, flowers, handwork and needlework, homebrew, honey and bee products, livestock, photography, poultry, quilts, rabbits, sewing, spirited beverages and soda pop, and woodworking.\n\nThe Fair also features free entertainment around the grounds, and events and contests like the rodeo, Diaper Derby, and Alaska Grown Games. The Fair also hosts a midway with carnival rides and games, and presents big name concerts each year as part of the AT&T Borealis Concert Series.\n\nThe AT&T Concert Series is a big draw for the Fair, which has played host to dozens of bands and performers over the last 75 years.\n\nPrevious performers have included Ted Nugent, David Archuleta, Lonestar, Hinder, Shinedown, Boyz II Men, Darryl Worley, Collective Soul, Seether, Bucky Covington, Beach Boys, Bill Engvall, Rodney Atkins, Kansas, Gin Blossoms, The Rembrandts, Emerson Drive, Charlie Daniels Band, Craig Morgan, Terri Clark, Cheap Trick, Terry Fator, Uncle Kracker, Los Lobos, Toby Mac, Tanya Tucker, Tracy Byrd, Carman, Kenny Rogers, Howie Mandel, Chris Cagle, Chris LeDoux, REO Speedwagon, Sean Kingston, Tracy Lawrence, Three Days Grace, Iggy Azalea, Richie Havens and Micky Dolenz.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "906044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=906044", "title": "Attempted murder", "text": "Attempted murder\n\nAttempted murder is a crime of attempt in various jurisdictions.\n\nSection 239 of the \"Criminal Code\" makes attempted murder punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment. If a gun is used, the minimum sentence is four, five or seven years, dependent on prior convictions and relation to organized crime.\n\nIn English criminal law, attempted murder is the crime of simultaneously preparing to commit an unlawful killing and having a specific intention to cause the death of a human being under the Queen's Peace. The phrase \"more than merely preparatory\" is specified by the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 to denote the fact that preparation for a crime by itself does not constitute an \"attempted crime\".\n\nIn England and Wales, as an \"attempt\", attempted murder is an offence under section 1(1) of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 and is an indictable offence which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (the same as the mandatory sentence for murder). The corresponding legislation for Northern Ireland is section 3(1) of the Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 (No.1120 (N.I.13)).\n\nThe \"mens rea\" (\"Latin\" for the \"guilty mind\") for murder includes an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm where there is virtual certainty of death resulting, whereas attempted murder depends on an intention to kill and an overt act towards committing homicide. Attempted murder is only the planning of a murder and acts taken towards it, not the actual killing, which is the murder. This makes the offence very difficult to prove and it is more common for a lesser charge to be preferred under the Offences against the Person Act 1861.\n\nHowever, in \"R v Morrison\" [2003] 1 WLR 1859, the Court of Appeal considered the issue of alternative verdicts on an indictment with a single count of attempted murder. Morrison had gone into a shop with two other men on a robbery with a firearm. They demanded money and one of the men shot at the shopkeeper who suffered only minor injury. The prosecution had many opportunities to add other counts before the trial but failed to act. Having heard the case, the judge expressed his view that the jury could consider an attempted grievous bodily harm (GBH) under section 18 of the 1861 Act and Morrison was duly convicted of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm. The Court of Appeal confirmed that attempting to cause grievous bodily harm is a valid alternative to attempted murder because there can be no intention to kill someone without the intention also to cause grievous bodily harm.\n\nThis is a practical decision to ensure that the criminal justice system did not allow a guilty person to walk away because only one charge had been preferred. But it is not necessarily a good general principle because, in euthanasia for example, a person assisting intends to cause death, but with no suffering. That attempting to cause grievous bodily harm must be an alternative verdict should the intended victim not die would be a strange outcome because there is no intention to cause any long-lasting and serious injury: the two attempted offences have different \"mens rea\" requirements so that proof of intent to murder would not necessarily meet the requirement for section 18 of the 1861 Act.\n\nFirst, acting deliberately and intentionally or recklessly with extreme disregard for human life, the person attempted to kill someone; and the person did something that was a substantial step toward committing the crime. [Mere preparation is not a substantial step toward committing a crime.]\n\nThere must be more than merely preparatory acts and, although the defendant may threaten death, this may not provide convincing evidence of an intention to kill unless the words are accompanied by relevant action, e.g. finding and picking up a weapon and making serious use of it, or making a serious and sustained physical attack without a weapon.\n\nThe defences of duress and necessity are not available to a person charged with attempted murder. Conversely, the statutory defence of marital coercion is, on the face of the statute, available to a wife charged with attempted murder.\n\nPrior to 1967, sections 11 to 15 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 created a number of offences of attempting to commit murder by various specified means (ss.11 to 14), and an offence of attempting to commit murder by any means not specified in those offences (s.15).\n\nAfter the repeal of these offences by the Criminal Law Act 1967, attempted murder was allowed to subsist at common law until the enactment of the 1981 Act.\n\nAttempted murder is a crime at common law in Scotland. Attempted murder is the same as the offence of murder in Scottish law with the only difference being that the victim has not died. The offence of murder was defined in Drury v HM Advocate:\n\nIntention can be inferred from the circumstances of the case. Wicked recklessness is determined objectively and is \"recklessness so gross that it indicates a state of mind which falls to be treated as wicked and depraved as the state of mind of a deliberate killer.\" As with all common law offences in Scotland, the maximum punishment available is life imprisonment.\n\nIn the United States, attempted murder is an inchoate crime. A conviction for attempted murder requires a demonstration of an intent to murder, meaning that the perpetrator either tried to murder and failed (e.g. attempted to shoot the victim and missed or shot the victim and the victim survived) or took a substantial step towards committing a murder (e.g. purchasing a gun or other deadly weapon and writing about his or her intent to kill).\n\n"}

{"id": "3220874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3220874", "title": "Battle of Harim", "text": "Battle of Harim\n\nThe Battle of Harim (Harenc) was fought on 12 August 1164 near Artah between the forces of Nur ad-Din Zangi and a combined army from the County of Tripoli, the Principality of Antioch, the Byzantine Empire and Armenia. Nur ad-Din won a crushing victory, capturing most of the leaders of the opposing army.\n\nIn 1163 King Amalric I of Jerusalem led an invasion of Egypt, leaving the crusader states open to attack from the east. Nur ad-Din took advantage of this to invade Tripoli, but he was taken by surprise by a large combination of enemies at the Battle of al-Buqaia and was almost killed himself. He then moved north to Antioch, with assistance from his brother Qutb ad-Din in Mosul, his other vassals from Aleppo and Damascus, and the Ortoqids of the Jazira, and besieged the fortress of Harim (Harenc) in 1164. As William of Tyre says, \"he stationed his engines around it in the customary manner and began to assault the place with a fury which permitted the inhabitants no rest.\"\n\nReginald of Saint Valery, lord of Harim, called for help, and Raymond III of Tripoli, Bohemund III of Antioch, and Joscelin III of Edessa arrived to relieve the siege. They were joined by Konstantinos Kalamanos, the Byzantine governor of Cilicia, and Thoros, and Mleh of Armenia, as well as Hugh VIII of Lusignan and Geoffrey Martel, brother of William IV of Angoulême, both of whom had recently arrived on pilgrimage. \n\nNur ad-Din prepared to give up the siege when they arrived, but the crusaders, inspired by the victory at al-Buqaia, and, \"regardless of the rules of military discipline ... recklessly dispersed and roved hither and yon in pursuit of the foe.\" Nur ad-Din's troops defended against their charge and led a counterattack, pushing the crusaders into a swamp, and they were massacred \"like victims before the altar.\" \n\nIt is possible that Nur ad-Din was only feigning a retreat in order to draw the crusaders into an ambush, but abandoning a siege when a relief army arrived was a standard tactic and Nur ad-Din presumably had no way of knowing the crusaders would follow him. William's assertion that this was a reckless move is further evidence of this. \"Only the Armenian Thoros, who had forseen the Turkish maneuver and had not set off in pursuit, escaped from the disaster\". Mleh also avoided capture. Konstantinos Kalamanos, Hugh, Raymond, Bohemund, and Joscelin were captured and imprisoned in Aleppo. According to Ibn al-Athir, 10,000 crusaders were killed.\n\nNur ad-Din resumed the siege and captured Harim a few days later. With Amalric absent in Egypt, all three crusader states were now without their rulers, but Nur ad-Din did not want to attack Antioch itself for fear of provoking a Byzantine response, as the Principality was technically an Imperial fief. To his critics he replied, \"I would rather have Bohemund as a neighbor than the King of the Greeks!\". Nur ad-Din went on to besiege and capture Banias. Amalric abandoned Egypt and marched north with Thierry of Alsace to relieve Nur ad-Din's pressure on Antioch. Bohemund was released from captivity in 1165 but Raymond remained in prison until 1173.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1859789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1859789", "title": "Bride burning", "text": "Bride burning\n\nBride burning or bride-burning is a form of domestic violence practiced in countries located on or around the Indian subcontinent. A category of dowry death, bride-burning occurs when a young woman is murdered by her husband or his family for her family's refusal to pay additional dowry. The wife is typically doused with kerosene, gasoline, or other flammable liquid, and set alight, leading to death by fire. Kerosene is most often used as the fuel. It is most common in India and has been a major problem there since at least 1993.\n\nThis crime has been treated as culpable homicide and, if proven, is usually accordingly punished by up to lifelong imprisonment or death. Bride burning has been recognized as an important public health problem in India, accounting for around 2500 deaths per year in the country. In 1995, \"Time\" Magazine reported that dowry deaths in India increased from around 400 a year in the early 1980s to around 5800 a year by the middle of the 1990s. A year later, CNN ran a story saying that every year police receive more than 2500 reports of bride burning. According to Indian National Crime Record Bureau, there were 1948 convictions and 3876 acquittals in dowry death cases in 2008.\n\nA dowry death is the death of a young woman in South Asian countries, primarily India, who is murdered or driven to suicide by her husband. This results from the husband continually attempting to extract more dowry from the bride or her family. Bride burning is just one form of dowry death. Others include acid throwing and Eve teasing. Because dowry typically depends on class or socioeconomic status, women are often subjected to the dowry pressures of their future husband or his relatives.\n\nThere are at least four perspectives on why bride burning came to be and how its existence has prevailed in South Asian nations, as detailed by Avnita Lakhani in her report on bride burning titled “The Elephant in the Room Is Out of Control\". These theories describe practices that contributed to the rise of dowry as a whole, thus ultimately contributing to bride burning.\n\nOne of the more culturally-founded theories suggests that in a highly patriarchal society such as India, a woman’s role is defined from before she is born, which ultimately places her as lesser than men. Because she is seen as a burden and an \"extra mouth to feed\", her status as an economic liability promotes the idea that men, who are considered physical assets, can treat women as subservient. Once a woman marries, she is bound to her husband and his will because “society mandates obedience to her husband\".\n\nAnother theory claims that consumerism, a primarily Western ideal that is newly founded in developing nations, has caused countries like India to become greedy. Because of this, dowry is used as a means to gain a higher socioeconomic status. As status is continually gained, the demand for bridal dowry increases in order to keep moving up the social ladder.\n\nLakhani also suggests that, historically speaking, it has been noted that the dowry system may have been conceived as a way to distinguish Muslim from Hindu culture, creating a further divide within castes. A higher dowry would indicate a higher status and distinction from Islam, thus providing an incentive to demand a larger dowry.\n\nFinally, some scholars argue that the dowry practice came out of British rule and influence in India in order to distinguish \"different forms of marriage\" between castes. When the dowry system was established within the higher castes, the British government sought to reinforce it in the lower castes as a means to eradicate their more ritualised marriages. Such forms of union were discredited until only upper caste marriage systems were recognised.\n\nDr. Ashley K. Jutla, MD and David Heimbach describe bride burning by saying that \"the husband and/or in-laws have determined that the dowry, a gift given from the daughter's parents to the husband, was inadequate and therefore attempt to murder the new bride to make the husband available to remarry or to punish the bride and her family.\" In India, dowry size is a reflection of wealth. The Indian author Rajesh Talwar has written a play on dowry deaths titled 'The Bride Who Would Not Burn.'\n\nIn 1961, the Government of India passed the Dowry Prohibition Act, making the dowry demands in wedding arrangements illegal.\n\nIn 1986, the Indian Parliament added dowry deaths as a new domestic violence crime. According to the new section 304-B of the Indian Penal Code, where a bride \"within 7 years of her marriage is killed and it is shown that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband, or any relative of her husband, or in connection with any demand for dowry, such death shall be called 'dowry death' and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death.\"\n\nThe offenders can be sentenced for any period, from a minimum of seven years in prison to a maximum of life. Many cases of dowry-related domestic violence, suicides, and murders have been reported. A 1997 report claimed that at least 5000 women die each year because of dowry deaths and at least a dozen die each day in 'kitchen fires' thought to be intentional. About 30 percent of reported dowry deaths result in convictions in courts.\n\nIn Pakistan, the Progressive Women's Association says that 300 women are burned to death each year by their husband's families and that bride burning incidents are sometimes disguised as accidents, such as an 'exploding stove'. According to the Association, doctors say that victims presenting from these accidents have injuries inconsistent with stove burns. According to an Amnesty International report in 1999, although 1600 bride burning incidents were reported, only 60 were prosecuted and, of those, only two resulted in convictions.\n\nIn Pakistan, women including Shahnaz Bukhari have been campaigning for protective legislation against the practice, for established women’s shelters and for hospitals with specialised burn wards. Amnesty International has said that pressure from within, as well as from international human rights groups, may be increasing the level of awareness within the Pakistani government. The BBC estimated that roughly 300 Pakistani brides were burnt to death in 1999.\n\nIn 1988, a survey showed that 800 women were killed in this manner; in 1989, the number rose to 1100, and in 1990 it stood at 1800 estimated killings. Newspapers in Lahore in a six-month period (1997) reported on average 15 attacks a month. According to an estimate by Human Development in South Asia, on average there are 16 cases of bride burnings a month. Women's eNews reported 4000 women attacked in this manner in Islamabad's surroundings over an eight-year period and that the average age range of victims is between 18 and 35 with an estimated 30 percent being pregnant at the time of death. Shahnaz Bukhari has said of such attacks Either Pakistan is home to possessed stoves which burn only young housewives, and are particularly fond of genitalia, or looking at the frequency with which these incidences occur there is a grim pattern that these women are victims of deliberate murder. According to the Progressive Women's Association such attacks are a growing problem and in 1994 on International Women's Day announced that various NGOs would join to raise awareness of the issue.\n\nOccasionally, bride burning happens among resettled Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities in other parts of the world, including the United States.\n\nAleyamma Mathew was a registered nurse at a hospital in Carrollton, Texas, who died of burn wounds on 5 April 1992. She and her husband, Mathew Varughese, had immigrated from India two decades before and had three daughters in the United States. The couple had been having marital problems since the late 1980s, which culminated in a fight that led to Aleyamma’s death. She was found by her children, doused in gasoline and covered in flames, dying soon after.\n\nBrief articles were run in the \"Dallas Morning News\" and \"The Atlanta-Journal Constitution\" after the incident, while the \"Dallas Observer\" ran a detailed, nine page article covering Aleyamma’s death. The article faced some criticism for its portrayal of non-Western countries as backward or inappropriate: “Battered by her husband, Aleyamma Mathew remained true to her culture. In the end she became its victim.”\n\nThere are current governmental initiatives to criminalize bride burning and grassroots organizations working to combat the practice, as well as international laws working against human rights violations. Finally, there are many proposed initiatives in place to end bride burning globally.\n\nIn 1961, India enacted the Dowry Prohibition Act, to halt dowry murders. It was amended in the early 1980s to “rectify several inherent weaknesses and loopholes” in order to make it a criminal offense if the husband or his relatives causes a woman to “die of burns or bodily injury or unnatural circumstances within seven years of the marriage and where there is evidence that she suffered cruelty and harassment in connection with the dowry.” Unfortunately, this particular law does not provide a comprehensive definition of dowry, which can change the way it is demanded and delivered. Ultimately, this allowed perpetrators more flexibility in the court of dowry death. The seven-year clause is equally problematic, as it simply allowed husbands to wait until that period ended to burn or otherwise cause the death of their bride.\n\nAnother major Indian law, the 1983 “Anti-Cruelty Statute\", prohibits cruelty towards a wife and subjects the husband and/or in-laws to fines or imprisonment if they inflict cruelty upon the wife. However, the law is equally ambiguous, which results in inadequate enforcement of bride burning and dowry murders.\n\nArticle 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares the following: “All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.” Article 5 proclaims: “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”\n\nIn India, where most cases of bride burning are seen, domestic legislation is typically inadequately enforced. Because of this, grassroots organizations “have taken up the cause to halt bride burning\". One example of this is government-funded family counseling center cells, in which the intended goal is to strengthen family ties and reduce legal intervention. However, often such cells only reinforce the stereotype of “women’s sharp tongues” and men’s power to “hit and beat.” Other similar counseling-style NGOs have been developed in order to resolve such issues with similar consequences.\n\nPrimarily, alternative initiatives resolve around reform of current flawed, failing laws. One proposal calls for the expansion of the protection for women under the international refugee law in order to provide asylum to victims of gender discrimination or gendercide. One way this could be achieved would be by including women in the definition of a “persecuted social group”, which would allow their gender to seek international asylum under fear of dowry-related persecution globally.\n\nIn April 1984, European Parliament introduced a proposal that would “protect women from persecution on the basis of gender” by reforming international refugee laws. However, the proposal was rejected.\n\nAnother solution is to increase economic interest for women by establishing their property rights. Even when married, the bride has no rights over the property belonging to the husband while he is living.

There are separate men's and women's races, with many colleges entering more than one crew. The regatta is organized by Christ Church Boat Club.\n\nThe regatta is held on the Isis, the stretch of the River Thames running through Oxford, in Christ Church Meadow (the park in Oxford belonging to Christ Church). The stretch of the river that is used is generally familiar to novice crews as the stretch where they train. The course is only between about 500 and 750 metres long, from a part of the river between \"Longbridges\" and the start of the boathouse island to a finish line near the Head of the River pub by Folly Bridge.\n\nThe competition is run over about four days in total, usually from Wednesday of 7th week in Michaelmas Term to Saturday of 7th Week. Races are head-on-head between two teams that are chosen at random. The winner of the race will progress to the next round of races. The loser may be knocked out so that they no longer race. However, the loser of a first round race will enter the repechage, meaning that they have the chance to stay in the competition. The knock-out rounds of the competition proceed until two teams are left to race against each other in the Final.\n\nA regatta of novice crews has potential problems. During the course of the regatta, several races have to be stopped once they have started due to novice crews becoming stranded within the racing lanes. Also, at this time in Michaelmas Term, weather is often not especially agreeable. It is generally quite cold and often raining, with the result that the river can be higher and faster than is perhaps ideal. The regatta in 2006 had to be cancelled two days in because of the river's condition. The entire regatta was cancelled in 2000 and 2007 for the same reason. In 2012, some crews did get out for the first day but rapid stream and weather changes forced a cancellation of the regatta.\n\n\n"}

Before entering politics, he worked in the Corporate Affair field within the Minerals and Telecommunications industries. He was also a small business owner.\n\nCosgove has been a member of the Labour Party since he was fourteen, and has held a number of posts within the party. He was chairman of the party's Canterbury branch from 1989 to 1994, and served as campaign manager to Labour Party leader Mike Moore in the 1990 election and the 1993 election.\n\nHe was a strong supporter of Moore, and opposed Moore's replacement by Helen Clark. Before the 1996 election he was involved in discussions with Moore to form a new party but this failed to eventuate.\n\nCosgrove himself stood for election in Moore's former Waimakariri seat in the 1999 election, and was successful. He was re-elected in the 2002, 2005 and 2008 general elections. However, he was defeated in the electorate by National's Kate Wilkinson in 2011 and was subsequently elected as list MP. Wilkinson retired at the end of the parliamentary term and was replaced as National's candidate for the by Matthew Doocey, who had previously contested the in Christchurch East.

Boy racers attempted to intimidate Cosgrove in a number of ways, including defacing billboards and driving past his house on Saturday nights. New Zealand has considerable problems with boy racers, leading to many car seizures and a new law being mooted to crush the vehicles of the worst offenders.\n\nWhen Lianne Dalziel confirmed that she would contest the 2013 Christchurch mayoralty, her Christchurch Earthquake Recovery portfolio was split and assigned to Cosgrove and Ruth Dyson in July 2013.

Due to the many prominent royals, aristocrats, and society figures who attended as well as the overall lavishness of the ball, it was considered the event of the 1897 London Season.\n\nIn 1897, The Duke and Duchess of Devonshire hosted the Devonshire House Ball at Devonshire House, the London residence (in Piccadilly) of the Dukes of Devonshire in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Duke had served as a Member of Parliament and a cabinet minister as a member of the Liberal Party and the Duchess, known as the Double Duchess, was the widow of the William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester.\n\nFollowing the death of Prince Albert in 1861, Queen Victoria had withdrawn from social life and \"the mantle of royal entertaining\" was passed to the Prince of Wales and his wife, Alexandra. During the 1870s, they hosted a costume ball at Marlborough House, their London residence, which was considered a success and carried on the popularity of such events. The Devonshires, who were close friends of the Prince and Princess of Wales, therefore, decided to throw a costume ball thrown to celebrate Queen Victoria's diamond jubilee. The Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession had taken place on 22 June 1897 and followed a route six miles long through London. More than 700 invitations were sent out a month before the event, although some reports of the event stated up to 3,000 invites. By accident, Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Maria, the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha did not receive invitations. When the Duchess of Devonshire saw her at a different jubilee fête and asked if she was coming, \"the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha freezingly replied, 'Certainly not'\".\n\nWhile the Queen did not attend, almost all of the British royal family attended the ball and nearly every other European royal family was represented. \"The New York Times\" claimed in September 1897 that the ball was, \"to a certain degree a duplicate of the Bradley Martin ball\" which was held at The Waldorf Hotel in New York City on 10 February 1897.\n\nThe Duke of Devonshire invited the London photographic firm of James Lafayette, who had been awarded a Royal Warrant ten years previously, to set up a tent (in the garden behind the house) to photograph the guests in costume during the Ball. In 1899, the studio of Walker & Boutal published 286 of the Lafayette photographs.\n\nFollowing the ball, The Duchess received a letter from Francis Knollys, Private Secretary to the Sovereign, indicating that the Prince, later King Edward VII, who arrived after 11 o'clock, thought the party a success.\n\nAt the ball, the attendees included:\n\n\nThe Duchess of Devonshire's costume was described in detail by \"The Times\":\n\n\"The Duchess of Devonshire, as Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, wore a magnificent costume. The skirt of gold tissue was embroidered all over in a star-like design in emeralds, sapphires, diamonds, and other jewels outlined with gold, the corners where it opened in front being elaborately wrought in the same jewels and gold to represent peacocks outspread tails. This opened to show an underdress of cream crepe de chine, delicately embroidered in silver, gold, and pearls and sprinkled all over with diamonds. The train, which was attached to the shoulders by two slender points and was fastened at the waist with a large diamond ornament, was a green velvet of a lovely shade, and was superbly embroidered in Oriental designs introducing the lotus flower in rubies, sapphires, amethysts, emeralds, and diamonds, with four borderings on contrasting grounds, separated with gold cord. The train was lined with turquoise satin. The bodice was composed of gold tissue to match the skirt, and the front was of crepe de chine hidden with a stomacher of real diamonds, rubies and emeralds and jewelled belt. A gold crown incrusted (sic) with emeralds, diamonds, and rubies, with a diamond drop at each curved end and two upstanding white ostrich feathers in the middle, and round the front festoons of pearls with a large pear shaped pearl in the centre falling on the forehead.\"\n\nOne of the most expensive costumes was worn by Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough who went as the French Ambassador to the Court of Catherine the Great. The velvet costume was made by the House of Worth and was embroidered in silver, pearls and diamonds with a waistcoat made out of gold and white damask. The price of the costume, which cost 5,000 francs, reportedly even shocked the Duke, who had famously married American heiress Consuelo Vanderbilt in 1895.\n\nThe ball was reproduced on the London stage in Drury Lane in September 1897 \"to the scandal of nobility and the amusement of the commoners.\" The ball was utilized as the setting for the last act of a new play entitled \"The White Heather\" by Cecil Raleigh and Henry Hamilton. \"The New York Times\" stated \"the very possessions of royalter were 'desecrated' by exhibition on the stage, for the managers, with enterprise almost America, had purchased from the costumers some of the most gorgeous habiliments worn at that revel.\" The play inspired the 1919 film, \"The White Heather\".\n\n\n"}

Bertram and mechanic Adolf Klausmann were rescued and hospitalised in Perth. Klausmann suffered significant long-term psychological effects from their ordeal. Books by Bertram regarding his adventures became best-sellers in Germany during 1933.\n\nIn 1934, Bertram joined the Nazi Party and the SA (\"Brownshirts\"). \n\nBertram's script for a drama set in an Australian gold mining town, was made into \"Frauen für Golden Hill\" (\"Women for Golden Hill\"), released in 1938.

{"id": "2749020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2749020", "title": "Heroes of Wrestling", "text": "Heroes of Wrestling\n\nHeroes of Wrestling was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event that took place on October 10, 1999 from the Casino Magic hotel and casino in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. The event was meant to be the first in a series of pay-per-views that would feature popular wrestling stars from the 1980s and early 1990s. Plans for the franchise were abandoned following the event, which suffered from a poor buy rate and several controversies, most notably a disastrous main event featuring an inebriated Jake Roberts.\n\nPlaying off the resurgence in popularity of pro wrestling at the time, Fosstone Productions president Bill Stone conceived a series of events consisting of wrestling stars from the 1980s and early 1990s fighting one another in a series of \"dream matches\". Stone booked the initial pay-per-view with the intent of having three more, run on a quarterly basis, if the initial target of 40,000 buys was reached.\n\nAlthough the event was heavily promoted, it was only purchased by 29,000 households. Additionally, the event itself was generally regarded to be of poor quality: \"Wrestling Observer\" rated it the worst major wrestling event of 1999, with its editor Dave Meltzer giving a rating of \"absolute zero\" to a tag team match featuring Luke Williams and Butch Miller facing Nikolai Volkoff and The Iron Sheik. Meltzer's colleague, Bryan Alvarez of \"Figure Four Weekly\", has repeatedly referred to this match as the worst he has ever seen and rated it \"minus more stars than there are in the universe\"\n\nMinor controversy initially erupted at the beginning of the broadcast due to a last-minute change of commentators. Gordon Solie, a well-respected figure in the wrestling world with several decades of experience delivering play-by-play, had been advertised as one of the event's commentators. Shortly before the event, Solie fell ill with the throat cancer to which he would succumb nine months later. No announcement was made of the change before the show, and neither Solie nor his illness were ever mentioned during the broadcast. Solie's replacement, Randy Rosenbloom, appeared to have little to no knowledge of professional wrestling, delivering what would come to be regarded as some of the poorest color commentary ever given at a professional wrestling event. Rosenbloom repeatedly made mistakes during the broadcast, such as misidentifying wrestlers' countries of origin, and having to be repeatedly corrected on basic wrestling terminology by his broadcast partners Dutch Mantell and Captain Lou Albano, such as when he called an arm drag performed by Marty Jannetty a \"reverse slam takedown\". A particular source of criticism was Rosenbloom's inability to identify a simple dropkick, repeatedly calling the maneuver such things as a \"flying kick,\" \"flying leg kick,\" and \"leg drop\".\n\nThe show is nominally remembered for its conclusion, originally slated to be a double-main event pitting Jake Roberts against Jim Neidhart, and King Kong Bundy against Yokozuna. Roberts' problems with drug and alcohol addiction had been well publicized in the preceding years, and his booking in the main event was meant to capitalize on the resurgence in popularity he had enjoyed as a result of his attempts at sobriety. Roberts' return to the ring was meant to be the high point of the evening, and the match responsible for generating the most publicity. However, Roberts suffered a relapse prior to the show and consumed a significant amount of alcohol before arriving. Prior to his match with Neidhart, Roberts had been scheduled to cut a promo in which he would taunt Neidhart. Due to his level of intoxication, Roberts' promo instead consisted of a slurred, incoherent rant consisting largely of wordplay based on the event's casino setting. One particular segment of the rant would go viral after it was posted on WrestleCrap:\n\nYou don't want to play cards with me because I'll cheat. Okay? I cheat. You wanna play 21? I've got 22. You want to play blackjack? I've got two of those, too! You wanna play ... Aces and eights, baby? I got too many of those, too!\n\nAfter the interview, Roberts staggered to the ring with his trademark snake. However, upon reaching the ring, Roberts put the snake down and attempted to return backstage; he then reversed course, returned to ringside, and began greeting fans. Before entering the ring, Roberts grabbed a female fan and had her rub her hands on his bare chest. Later, Roberts removed the snake from its bag and simulated masturbation with it. The event's producers cut to wide-shots of the crowd during the incident, so that at-home viewers were unaware what was happening in the ring. Roberts eventually collapsed in the middle of the ring with the snake draped over his body; the prone Roberts then began to attempt to kiss the snake.\n\nIn an effort to salvage the match, promoter Bill Stone decided on the fly to combine the main events into one tag team event and sent Bundy to team with Neidhart and Yokozuna to team with Roberts. Stone then sent a member of the production crew, Michael Henry, to ringside to consult with the wrestlers. Bundy pinned Roberts by hitting him with a splash after Roberts had staggered and fallen around the ring several times, despite Roberts not being the legal man in the ring. Yokozuna and Henry attempted to salvage the event and Roberts' reputation by trying to goad Roberts into attacking Henry, making his behavior appear scripted. Roberts was too inebriated to realize what was happening and remained oblivious to Yokozuna and Henry's attacks. Yokozuna then hit a Samoan drop on Henry to make the entire series of events appear scripted; while Yokozuna attacked Henry, Roberts began to disrobe in the middle of the ring and the producers cut the feed immediately thereafter.\n\n\n\n"}

For many traditions in Hinduism, Holi celebrates the killing of Holika by Vishnu in order to save Prahlad, a devotee of God Vishnu in the city of Multan Pakistan, and thus Holi gets its name. In olden days, people use to contribute a piece of wood or two for the Holika bonfire, and this represents Holika killing her brother Hiranya Kashipu.\n\nThe night before Holi, pyres are burnt in North India, Nepal and parts of South India in keeping with this tradition. The youth playfully steal all sorts of things and put them in Holika pyre.\n\nIt should also be noted that in some parts of India the day is actually called Holika Dehan . There are other activities associated with the story of Prahlad, but the burning of Holika is the one that we can most directly associate with Holi. Fire burnt on the eve of Holi (Holika Dahan) symbolizes the burning of Holika. The story as a whole is testament to the power of devotion (bhakta) over the evil represented by King Hiranyakashyapu, as Prahlad never lost his faith.\n\nDays before the festival people start gathering wood and combustible materials for the bonfire in parks, community centers, near temples and other open spaces. On top of the pyre is an effigy to signify Holika who tricked Prahalad into the fire. Inside homes, people stock up on color pigments, food, party drinks and festive seasonal foods such as \"gujiya\", \"mathri\", \"malpuas\" and other regional delicacies.\n\nOn the eve of Holi, typically at or after sunset, the pyre is lit, signifying Holika Dahan. The ritual symbolises the victory of good over evil. People sing and dance around the fire. People also perform parikrama of fire.\n\nThe next day people play Holi, the popular festival of colors.\n\nThe burning of Holika is the most common mythological explanation for the celebration of Holi. In different parts of India varying reasons are given for Holika's death but all agree that the incident occurred in the city of Mulasthana (modern Multan), Punjab. Among those are:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5133396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5133396", "title": "Jesus bloodline", "text": "Jesus bloodline\n\nThe Jesus bloodline is a hypothetical sequence of lineal descendants of the historical Jesus, often by Mary Magdalene, usually portrayed as his wife. Differing and contradictory versions of a Jesus bloodline hypothesis have been proposed in numerous books by authors such as Louis Martin (1886), Donovan Joyce (1973), Andreas Faber-Kaiser (1977), Barbara Thiering (1992), Margaret Starbird (1993), and various websites. Dan Brown's novel \"The Da Vinci Code\" used the premise for its plot line. The 2007 documentary \"The Lost Tomb of Jesus\" proposed that evidence existed to show that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and that their son was named Judah, based upon inscriptions found on ossuaries discovered in Jerusalem in 1980. Biblical scholar and author James Tabor has affirmed his belief in a married Jesus.\nHypothetical Jesus bloodlines should not be confused with the biblical genealogy of Jesus or the historical relatives of Jesus and their descendants, who are known as the \"Desposyni\".\n\nThe 13th-century Cistercian monk and chronicler Peter of Vaux de Cernay claimed it was part of Catharist belief that the earthly Jesus Christ had a relationship with Mary Magdalene, described as his concubine.\n\nEarly Mormon leaders Jedediah M. Grant, Orson Hyde, Joseph F. Smith and Orson Pratt stated it was part of their religious belief that Jesus Christ was polygamous, quoting this in their respective sermons. The Mormons also used an apocryphal passage attributed to the 2nd-century Greek philosopher Celsus: \"The grand reason why the gentiles and philosophers of his school persecuted Jesus Christ was because he had so many wives. There were Elizabeth and Mary and a host of others that followed him\". This appears to have been a summary of a garbled or second-hand reference to a quote from Celsus the Platonist preserved in the apologistic work Contra Celsum (\"Against Celsus\") by the Church Father Origen: \"such was the charm of Jesus' words, that not only were men willing to follow Him to the wilderness, but women also, forgetting the weakness of their sex and a regard for outward propriety in thus following their Teacher into desert places.\"\n\nThe French 19th-century socialist politician, Louis Martin (pseudonym of Léon Aubry, died 1900), in his 1886 book \"Les Evangiles sans Dieu\" described the historical Jesus as a turned atheist, who had married Mary Magdalene, and that both had travelled to the South of France, where they had a son.\n\nThe Jesus bloodline hypothesis which held that the historical Jesus had married Mary Magdalene and fathered a child with her was brought to the attention of the general public again in the 20th century by Donovan Joyce in his 1973 book \"The Jesus Scroll\". In his 1977 book \"Jesus died in Kashmir: Jesus, Moses and the ten lost tribes of Israel\", Andreas Faber-Kaiser explored the legend that Jesus met, married and had several children with a Kashmiri woman. The author also interviewed the late Basharat Saleem who claimed to be a Kashmiri descendant of Jesus. Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, and Henry Lincoln developed and popularized the hypothesis that a bloodline from Jesus and Mary Magdalene eventually became the Merovingian dynasty in their 1982 book \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\", in which they asserted: \n\nIn her 1992 book \"Jesus and the Riddle of the Dead Sea Scrolls: Unlocking the Secrets of His Life Story\", Barbara Thiering also developed a Jesus and Mary Magdalene bloodline hypothesis, basing her historical conclusions on her application of the so-called Pesher technique to the New Testament.\n\nIn her 1993 book \"The Woman with the Alabaster Jar: Mary Magdalen and the Holy Grail\", Margaret Starbird developed the hypothesis that Saint Sarah was the daughter of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and that this was the source of the legend associated with the cult at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer. She also noted that the name \"Sarah\" meant \"Princess\" in Hebrew, thus making her the forgotten child of the \"sang réal\", the blood royal of the King of the Jews.\n\nIn his 1996 book \"Bloodline of the Holy Grail: The Hidden Lineage of Jesus Revealed\", Laurence Gardner presented pedigree charts of Jesus and Mary Magdalene as the ancestors of all the European royal families of the Common Era. His 2000 sequel \"Genesis of the Grail Kings: The Explosive Story of Genetic Cloning and the Ancient Bloodline of Jesus\" is unique in claiming that not only can the Jesus bloodline truly be traced back to Adam and Eve but that the first man and woman were primate-alien hybrids created by the Anunnaki of ancient astronaut theory. The 2000 book \"Rex Deus: The True Mystery of Rennes-Le-Chateau and the Dynasty of Jesus\", Marylin Hopkins, Graham Simmans and Tim Wallace-Murphy developed a hypothesis based on a 1994 testimony by \"Michael Monkton\" (who claimed to be descended from Hugues de Payens), that a Jesus and Mary Magdalene bloodline was part of a shadow dynasty descended from twenty-four high priests of the Temple in Jerusalem known as \"Rex Deus\" – the \"Kings of God\".\n\nThe 2003 conspiracy fiction novel \"The Da Vinci Code\" by Dan Brown accepted some of the above hypotheses as being valid. Elements of some Jesus bloodline hypotheses were propounded by the 2007 documentary film \"The Lost Tomb of Jesus\" by Simcha Jacobovici focusing on the Talpiot Tomb discovery, which was also published as a book entitled \"The Jesus Family Tomb\". In 2007 psychic medium Sylvia Browne released the book \"The Two Marys: The Hidden History of the Mother and Wife of Jesus\", in which she tries to further validate the possibility of Jesus and Mary Magdalene producing a family.\n\nThe 2008 documentary \"Bloodline\" by Bruce Burgess, a filmmaker with an interest in paranormal claims, expands on the Jesus bloodline hypothesis and other elements of \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\". Accepting as valid the testimony of an amateur archaeologist codenamed \"Ben Hammott\" relating to his discoveries made in the vicinity of Rennes-le-Château since 1999; Burgess claims Ben has found the treasure of Bérenger Saunière: a mummified corpse, which they believe is Mary Magdalene, in an underground tomb they claim is connected to both the Knights Templar and the Priory of Sion. In the film, Burgess interviews several people with alleged connections to the Priory of Sion, including a Gino Sandri and Nicolas Haywood. A book by one of the documentary's researchers, Rob Howells, entitled \"Inside the Priory of Sion: Revelations from the World's Most Secret Society - Guardians of the Bloodline of Jesus\" presented the version of the Priory of Sion as given in the 2008 documentary, which contained several erroneous assertions, such as the claim that Plantard believed in the Jesus bloodline hypothesis. By 21 March 2012 Ben Hammott confessed and apologised on Podcast interview (using his real name Bill Wilkinson) that everything to do with the tomb and related artifacts was a hoax; revealing that the actual tomb was now destroyed, being part of a full sized set located in a warehouse in England.\n\nIn 2014 fringe investigative journalist Simcha Jacobovici and fringe religious studies historian Barrie Wilson suggested that a 6th century manuscript told the tale of Jesus and Mary Magdalene under the coding of \"Joseph\" and \"Aseneth\" This manuscript, called \"Joseph and Aseneth\", forms part of an anthology compiled by Pseudo-Zacharias Rhetor, so-named because it also includes the important Ecclesiastical History by the real Zacharias Rhetor. These documents are preserved as British Library Manuscript #17,202 along with other important works, e.g. The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, the finding of first century relics of Stephen and Nicodemus, and the Conversion of Constantine written by a bishop of Rome named Sylvester.\n\nAs Jacobovici and Wilson point out, there are two covering letters to \"Joseph and Aseneth\". One is by an anonymous individual who had found a small, very old Greek manuscript in a library belonging to the bishops who had come from Resh'aina. Being rusty in Greek, he asked his friend, Moses of Ingila, to translate the work, suspecting that it contained a hidden meaning. The second letter is by Moses of Ingila. He translated the work into Syriac, positioning it as a work of Wisdom whose meaning has to be carefully discerned, at the same time confirming the truth of mainstream Christianity in relation to Jesus Christ. He also indicated that it contains a hidden meaning. Along with the clues provided by the covering letters, the use of Christian terminology (\"Son of God,\" \"Bride of God\"), Eucharistic imagery and Syriac use of typology in which Old Testament figures prefigure New Testament ones, the authors argue that the work reflects a community which held that Jesus was married and had children. Using advanced digital imaging techniques, the authors restored the original Syriac text, providing a modern English translation of both \"Joseph and Aseneth\", and, for the first time ever, the two covering letters.\n\nAccording to Angela Standhartinger, Moses explained the story \"as an allegory of Christ's marriage to the soul\".\n\nIsraeli Biblical scholar, Rivka Nir wrote: \"…this is a serious-minded, thought-provoking and interesting book, giving expression to an excellent knowledge of early Christian sources and the ability to analyze and integrate them into a clear and comprehensible picture. The book abounds with historical surveys and enlightening discussions on its sources, terms, characters and various period-related aspects….This book will certainly occupy a highly important place in the scholarly quest for the historical Jesus, as it raises the fundamental question: how far can scholars go in this quest and to what extent are their conclusions founded\", but described the thesis as objectionable.\n\nThe book by Simcha Jacobovici and Barrie Wilson has been dismissed by mainstream Biblical scholarship. for example by Anglican theologian, Richard Bauckham,\n\nThe Church of England compared \"The Lost Gospel\" to a Monty Python sketch. The director of communications for the Archbishop's Council stated the book was an example of religious illiteracy and that ever since the publication of \"The Da Vinci Code\" in 2003, \"an industry had been constructed in which 'conspiracy theorists, satellite channel documentaries and opportunistic publishers had identified a lucrative income stream'.\"\n\n\"The Lost Gospel\" was described as historical nonsense by Markus Bockmuehl.\n\nThe following is a list of persons who have publicly claimed to be from a Jesus bloodline, or have had such a claim made about them:\n\nIn reaction to \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\", \"The Da Vinci Code\", and other controversial books, websites and films on the same theme, a significant number of individuals in the late 20th and early 21st centuries have adhered to a Jesus bloodline hypothesis despite its lack of substantiation. While some simply entertain it as a novel intellectual proposition, others hold it as an established belief thought to be authoritative and not to be disputed. Prominent among the latter are those who expect a direct descendant of Jesus will eventually emerge as a great man and become a messiah, a Great Monarch who rules a Holy European Empire, during an event which they will interpret as a mystical second coming of Christ.\n\nThe eclectic spiritual views of these adherents are influenced by the writings of iconoclastic authors from a wide range of perspectives. Authors like Margaret Starbird and Jeffrey Bütz often seek to challenge modern beliefs and institutions through a re-interpretation of Christian history and mythology. Some try to advance and understand the equality of men and women spiritually by portraying Mary Magdalene as being the apostle of a Christian feminism, and even the personification of the mother goddess or sacred feminine, usually associating her with the Black Madonna. Some wish the ceremony that celebrated the beginning of the alleged marriage of Jesus and Mary Magdalene to be viewed as a \"holy wedding\"; and Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and their alleged daughter, Sarah, to be viewed as a \"holy family\", in order to question traditional gender roles and family values. Almost all these claims are at odds with scholarly Christian apologetics, and have been dismissed as being New Age Gnostic heresies.\n\nNo mainstream Christian denomination has adhered to a Jesus bloodline hypothesis as a dogma or an object of religious devotion since they maintain that Jesus, believed to be God the Son, was perpetually celibate, continent and chaste, and metaphysically married to the Church; he died, was resurrected, ascended to heaven, and will eventually return to earth, thereby making all Jesus bloodline hypotheses and related messianic expectations impossible.\n\nMany fundamentalist Christians believe the Antichrist, prophesied in the Book of Revelation, plans to present himself as descended from the Davidic line to bolster his false claim that he is the Jewish Messiah. The intention of such propaganda would be to influence the opinions, emotions, attitudes, and behavior of Jews and philo-Semites to achieve his Satanic objectives. An increasing number of fringe Christian eschatologists believe the Antichrist may also present himself as descended from the Jesus bloodline to capitalize on growing adherence to the hypothesis in the general public.\n\nJesus bloodline hypotheses parallel other legends about the flight of disciples to distant lands, such as the one depicting Joseph of Arimathea traveling to England after the death of Jesus, taking with him a piece of thorn from the Crown of Thorns, which he later planted in Glastonbury. Historians generally regard these legends as \"pious fraud\" produced during the Middle Ages.\n\nThe Jesus bloodline hypothesis from the book \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\" is not contained in any of the \"Priory of Sion documents\" and was dismissed as fiction by Pierre Plantard in 1982 in a French radio interview, as well as by Philippe de Cherisey in a magazine article. However, Plantard's \"Priory of Sion\" documents prior to 1956 were found to be forgeries which were planted in French institutions to be later \"rediscovered\". Plantard only claimed that the Merovingians were descended from the Tribe of Benjamin, which contradicts the hypothesis of a Jesus bloodline as the missing link between the Merovingian line and the Davidic line from the Tribe of Judah. The notion of a direct bloodline from Jesus and Mary Magdalene, and its supposed relationship to the Merovingians (as well as their alleged modern descendants: House of Habsburg, Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg, Clan Sinclair, House of Stuart, House of Cavendish, House of Bourbon, House of Orléans and other noble families), is strongly dismissed as pseudohistorical by a qualified majority of Christian and secular historians such as Darrell Bock and Bart D. Ehrman, along with journalists and investigators such as Jean-Luc Chaumeil, who has an extensive archive on this subject matter.\n\nIn 2005, UK TV presenter and amateur archaeologist Tony Robinson edited and narrated a detailed rebuttal of the main arguments of Dan Brown and those of Baigent, Leigh, and Lincoln, \"The Real Da Vinci Code\", shown on Channel 4. The programme featured lengthy interviews with many of the main protagonists, and cast severe doubt on the alleged landing of Mary Magdalene in France, among other related myths, by interviewing on film the inhabitants of Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, the centre of the cult of Saint Sarah.\n\nThe Jesus bloodline hypothesis from the book \"Rex Deus: The True Mystery of Rennes-Le-Chateau and the Dynasty of Jesus\" hinges on the testimony of the authors' anonymous informant, \"Michael\", who claimed to be a \"Rex Deus\" scion. Evidence supporting the hypothesis was supposedly lost, and therefore cannot be independently verified, because Michael claimed that it was contained in his late father's bureau, which was sold by his brother unaware of its contents. Some critics point out the informant's account of his family history seems to be based on the controversial work of Barbara Thiering.\n\nRobert Lockwood, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh's director for communications, sees the notion of the Church conspiring to cover-up the truth about a Jesus bloodline as a deliberate piece of anti-Catholic propaganda. He sees it as part of a long tradition of anti-Catholic sentiment with deep roots in the American Protestant imagination but going back to the very start of the Reformation of 1517.\n\nAlthough Jesus bloodline hypotheses were not submitted to the judgment of the Jesus Seminar, a group of scholars involved in the quest for the historical Jesus from a liberal Christian perspective, they were unable to determine whether Jesus and Mary Magdalene had a matrimonial relationship due to the dearth of historical evidence. They concluded that the historical Mary Magdalene was not a repentant prostitute but a prominent disciple of Jesus and a leader in the early Christian movement. Bart D. Ehrman, who chairs the Department of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina, commented that, although there are some historical scholars who claim that it is likely that Jesus was married, the vast majority of New Testament and early Christianity scholars find such a claim to be historically unreliable.\n\nUltimately, the notion that a person living millennia ago has a small number of descendants living today is statistically improbable. Steve Olson, author of \"Mapping Human History: Genes, Race, and Our Common Origins\", published an article in \"Nature\" demonstrating that, as a matter of statistical probability:\n\nHistorian Ken Mondschein ridiculed the notion that the bloodline of Jesus and Mary Magdalene could have been preserved:\n\nChris Lovegrove, who reviewed \"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\" when first published in 1982, dismissed the significance of a Jesus bloodline, even if it were proven to exist despite all evidence to the contrary:\n"}
{"id": "2577361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2577361", "title": "Kapparot", "text": "Kapparot\n\nKapparot (, Ashkenazi transliteration: , ) is a customary , Jewish atonement ritual practiced by some Jews on the eve of Yom Kippur. This is a practice in which a chicken or money is waved over a person's head and the chicken is then slaughtered in accordance with halachic rules. (tzedakah).\n\n\"Kapparah\" (), the singular of \"kapparot\", means 'atonement' and comes from the Hebrew root k-p-r, which means 'to atone'.\n\nOn the afternoon before Yom Kippur, one prepares an item to be donated to the poor for consumption at the pre-Yom Kippur meal, recites the two biblical passages of and , and then swings the prepared charitable donation over one's head three times while reciting a short prayer three times.\n\nIn one variant of the practice of Kapparot, the item to be donated to charity is a rooster. In this case, the rooster would be swung overhead while still alive. After the Kapparot ritual is concluded, the rooster would be treated as a normal kosher poultry product, i.e., it would be slaughtered according to the laws of \"shechita\". It would then be given to charity for consumption at the pre-Yom Kippur meal. In modern times, this variant of the ritual is performed with a rooster for men and a hen for women.\n\nIn this case, the prayer recited translates as:\nIn a second variant of the practice of Kapparot, a bag of money is swung around the head and then given to charity.\n\nIn this case, the prayer recited translates as:\nThe practice of kapparot is mentioned for the first time by Amram Gaon of Sura Academy in Babylonia in 670 and later by Natronai ben Hilai, also of Sura Academy, in 853. Jewish scholars in the ninth century explained that since the Hebrew word means both \"man\" and \"rooster\", a rooster may substitute as a religious and spiritual vessel in place of a man.\n\nKapparot was strongly opposed by some rabbis, among them Nahmanides, Shlomo ben Aderet, and the Sephardi rabbi Joseph ben Ephraim Karo in the \"Shulchan Aruch\". According to the \"Mishnah Berurah\", his reasoning was based on the caution that it is similar to non-Jewish rites. \n\nThe Ashkenazi rabbi Moses Isserles disagreed with Karo and encouraged kapparot. In Ashkenazi communities especially, Rabbi Isserles' position came to be widely accepted, since Ashkenazi Jews will generally follow the halachic rulings of Rabbi Isserles where the Sephardic and Ashkenazic customs differ. It was also approved by Asher ben Jehiel (c. 1250–1327) and his son Jacob ben Asher (1269–1343) and other commentators. The ritual was also supported by Kabbalists, such as Isaiah Horowitz and Isaac Luria, who recommended the selection of a white rooster as a reference to and who found other mystic allusions in the prescribed formulas. Consequently, the practice became generally accepted among the Ashkenazi Jews and Hasidim of Eastern Europe. The \"Mishnah Berurah\" agrees with Rabbi Isserles, solidifying support for the practice among Lithuanian Jews as well. The Mishnah Berurah only supports the use of money (i.e., not a chicken) if there might be a problem with the slaughter due to haste or fatigue.\n\nIn the late 19th-century work \"Kaf Hachaim\", Yaakov Chaim Sofer approves of the custom for Sephardi Jews as well.\n\nSome Jews also oppose the use of chickens for Kapparot on the grounds of tza'ar ba'alei chayim, the principle banning cruelty to animals.\n\nOn Yom Kippur eve 2005, a number of caged chickens were abandoned in rainy weather as part of a kapparot operation in Brooklyn, New York; some of these starving and dehydrated chickens were subsequently rescued by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Jacob Kalish, an Orthodox Jewish man from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was charged with animal cruelty for the drowning deaths of 35 of these kapparot chickens. In response to such reports of the mistreatment of chickens, Jewish animal rights organizations have begun to picket public observances of kapparot, particularly in Israel.\n\nThe Kapparot ritual would seem to be constitutionally protected as an exercise of freedom of religion in the United States, based upon a 1993 Supreme Court of the United States decision in the case of \"Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah\". In that case, the court upheld the right of Santería adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision, \"Religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection\" (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Warren E. Burger in \"Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division\", ).\n\nIn October, 2017, public health and animal rights activists in New York City launched a campaign to compel NYC's Health Commissioner, Dr. Mary Bassett, to enforce seven public health codes violated during Kapporot. From October 2017 to May 2018, the activists disrupted four of her public speaking engagements and staged four protests in the lobby of the NYC Department of Health (DOH). The activists allege that Commissioner Bassett is turning a blind eye to the health code violations because the ultra-Orthodox Jews who practice the ritual represent a powerful voting bloc. A toxicology reported submitted to the court as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the DOH states that the ritual poses a risk to public health in the neighborhoods where it takes place. While Commissioner Bassett has not publicly acknowledged the toxicology report or the activists' claims about the health code violations, she has issued a public statement asserting that \"there remains no evidence that the use of chickens for Kaporos poses a significant risk to human health.\"\n\n\n"}

The referendum was initially planned for 15 November 2007, but was repeatedly delayed and ultimately never took place. \n\nThe referendum was mandated by Article 140 of the Constitution of Iraq. Article 140 required that before the referendum, measures had to be taken to reverse the Arabization policy employed by the Saddam Hussein administration during the Al-Anfal Campaign. Thousands of Kurds returned to Kirkuk following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The referendum was to decide whether enough had returned for the area to be considered Kurdish. \n\nKurdish resentment over the government's failure to implement Article 140 was one of the reasons for the 2017 Iraqi Kurdistan independence referendum, which posed the question, \"Do you want the Kurdistan Region and the Kurdistani areas outside the Region to become an independent state?\" The referendum led to episodes of Iraqi–Kurdish conflict and the government takeover of Kirkuk.\n\nFollowing the invasion of Iraq in 2003 by the United States-led coalition, the country was under the direct rule of the United States-appointed Coalition Provisional Authority, with advice from selected Iraqi leaders who sat on the Iraqi Governing Council. The IGC approved an interim constitution, the Law of Administration for the State of Iraq for the Transitional Period (Transitional Administrative Law, TAL), which established the framework for the drafting and approval of a permanent constitution.\n\nThe TAL included specific clauses providing for the return of and compensation for forced migrants and for the \"resolution of disputed territories including Kirkuk\" through arbitration:\n\nIn 2005, a permanent Constitution was approved which referred back to the TAL and set a deadline of the end of 2007 for completion:\n\nIn late 2007, the U.N. Special Representative for Iraq negotiated an extension of the deadline for six months. However, the federal parliament decided to refer the matter to the Constitutional Court to rule whether the article was now expired or how it should be implemented.\n\nThe government of Nouri al-Maliki appointed a \"Commission on the Normalisation of the Status of Kirkuk\" to implement the de-arabization program. The Justice Minister, Hashim Abderrahman al-Shibli, a secular Sunni Arab from the secular Iraqi National List coalition was appointed the head. A program of normalisation was to be followed by a census by July 2007 and a referendum in November 2007.\n\nIn April 2007, Turkish intelligence sources claimed that Kurdistan President Barzani had \"offered bribes to various Iraqi officials\" involved in the Commission, including $500,000 to al-Shibli. Turkey claimed that Iraqi Kurdistan was planning to annex Kirkuk \"\"illegally\", and that the rights of Iraqi Turkmen would be violated if Kirkuk joined Iraqi Kurdistan.\n\nShibli resigned as head of the Commission in March 2007, citing disagreements with his own coalition on Kirkuk. Raed Fahmy Jahid, another Sunni Arab from the INL was appointed his replacement in August 2007.\n\nIn February 2007, the Commission adopted a controversial plan, which gave Sunni Arabs $15,000 to relocate back to their towns of origin, plus a plot of land in their new home.\n\nIn September 2007, it was reported that the normalization program had been bogged down in technical difficulties. The Kurdish parties were reported to have agreed a delay to the timetable for the census and referendum.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Turkish government strongly opposed holding of the upcoming referendum in 2007, calling for it to be postponed. Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih said in a statement posted on the internet on 9 December 2006, \"The issue of Kirkuk will be resolved in accordance with the Iraqi Constitution Article 140. Consequently, this constitutional question will be resolved by the Iraqis themselves. No one can interfere in that.\" On 10 December, in a speech made at the International Institute of Strategic Studies in Manama, Bahrain, Turkish Defense Minister Vecdi Gonul warned the Iraqi government against imposing an \"unrealistic\" future on Kirkuk. Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari criticized Gonul, saying, \"You speak of Kirkuk as if it is a Turkish city. These are matters for Iraq to decide.\"\nThe Iraq Study Group of senior American politicians recommended that the referendum be delayed \"to avert communal violence given the very dangerous situation in Kirkuk\".\n\nIran called for a delay of two years for political reasons in early November 2007.\n\nSaudi Arabia reportedly offered the Iraqi Kurdish leaders $2 billion in exchange for delaying the process for ten years.\n\nIn June 2008 the UNAMI head, Staffan de Mistura recommended that the Akra District of Ninawa Governorate and the Makhmur District of Kirkuk Governorate be incorporated into Kurdistan but that the al-Hamdaniya area of Ninawa Governorate and the Mandali area of Diyala Governorate be excluded.

The theatre was the successor of the Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù, which became the Corfu city hall. It was destroyed during a Luftwaffe aerial bombardment in 1943. During its 41-year history it was one of the premier theatres and opera houses in Greece.\n\nThe Municipal theatre was built to accommodate the demands of a growing audience. The decision for its construction was taken in 1885, during the mayoralty of Georgios Theotokis, and construction started in 1893 by mayor Michael Theotokis. High construction \ncosts delayed its inaugural opening until 1902. The architect was the Italian Conrado Pergolesi who developed plans modelled after La Scala in Milan. The maximum height of the theatre was 39 meters; there was a gallery at the front entrance adorned by high columns of the Tuscan order. The entrance featured large purple columns and its high walls were decorated with frescoes of famous composers created by Italian artists. The upper floor was decorated by four Corinthian order semi-columns and a gable. The official emblem shield of Corfu stood in relief at the centre of the gable surrounded by a laurel wreath.\n\nThe auditorium included 64 decorated boxes arranged in three levels and a gallery for the general public at the top. The first box in the first row was reserved for the theatre committee. Behind this box, inside an office, the archives of Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo were kept. The first box of the second row was reserved for the Greek royal family. All boxes included gas lights at their bow. The commoners gathered at the top level in the gallery. There was a proscenium which accommodated the orchestra. The orchestra was mainly made up of locals and it performed 10 operas per cycle. Opera season started in September and ended on the Sunday before Ash Monday.\n\nThe stage curtain of the new theatre was inherited from its predecessor, Teatro di San Giacomo, and was created by an Italian artist. It depicted a scene from the \"Odyssey\" where Odysseus was welcomed by King Alcinous to the land of the Phaiakes.\n\nThe theatre was considered one of Europe's best, with great acoustics and richly decorated interiors depicting ancient Greek gods and musical themes, painted by Italian artists. It also functioned as a social gathering place where high society gathered for dances and balls. Its official opening date was 7 December 1902, with Wagner's opera \"Lohengrin\" as the inaugural performance. Kaiser Wilhelm II also attended performances while vacationing at his Achilleion palace. In 1907 the Old Philharmonic of Corfu rendered a symphony in a performance which received much acclaim from the audience.\n\nFrom 19 January 1916 through to 19 November 1918, the theatre also served as the place of assembly for the Serbian Parliament in exile, and the decision for the creation of the new united Kingdom of Yugoslavia was taken there. In 1923, refugees from Asia Minor were accommodated in the theatre boxes. \nDuring the first quarter of the twentieth century, many Italian operas were performed at the theatre. This tradition came to a halt following the bombardment of Corfu in 1923 by the Italians. After the bombardment the theatre featured Greek operas as well as Greek theatre performances by distinguished Greek actors such as Marika Kotopouli and Pelos Katselis.\n\nThe cost of the building escalated to about 1,000,000 British golden sovereigns, a huge amount at the time; its amortization was arranged for 1941. Two years later, on the night of 13 September 1943, the theatre was destroyed in a bombing raid by Hitler's Luftwaffe.\n\nThe archives of the theatre, including the historical San Giacomo archives, all valuables and art were destroyed in the bombing with the sole exception of the stage curtain, which was not in the premises the night of the bombing and thus escaped harm; among the losses are believed to have been numerous manuscripts of the work of Spyridon Xyndas, composer of the first opera in Greek. The remains of the building were considered to be without historical or other value and were condemned following a decision by the supervising architect Ioannis Kollas and civil engineers Georgios Linardos and Renos Paipetis. On 31 May 1952, mayor Stamatis Desyllas and the city council unanimously decided to demolish the theatre despite widespread public protests and legal challenges.\n"}
{"id": "4288088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4288088", "title": "Operation Hannibal", "text": "Operation Hannibal\n\nOperation \"Hannibal\" was a German naval operation involving the evacuation by sea of German troops and civilians from Courland, East Prussia, and the Polish Corridor from mid-January to May 1945 as the Red Army advanced during the East Prussian and East Pomeranian Offensives and subsidiary operations.\n\nThe Soviet East Prussian Offensive by the Red Army's 3rd Belarusian Front under General Ivan Chernyakhovsky commenced on January 13, 1945 and, with Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front, subsequently cut off East Prussia between January 23 and February 10, 1945. German Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz ordered General Admiral Oskar Kummetz, as Naval High Commander, Baltic, and Rear Admiral Konrad Engelhardt, head of the Kriegsmarine's shipping department, to plan and execute the \"Rettungsaktion\" (evacuation operation). Dönitz radioed a message to Gdynia in occupied Poland on January 23, 1945, to begin evacuations to ports outside of the Soviet area of operations. The operation was codenamed \"Hannibal\". Dönitz stated in his post-war memoirs that his aim had been to evacuate as many people as possible away from the Soviets.\n\nRight up until his suicide, Adolf Hitler insisted that the war go on. The flood of military personnel and German civilians eventually turned the operation into one of the largest evacuations by sea in history. Over a period of 15 weeks, somewhere between 494 and 1,080 merchant vessels of all types, including fishing boats and other craft, and utilizing Germany's largest remaining naval units, carried between 800,000 and 900,000 German civilians and 350,000 soldiers across the Baltic Sea to Germany and German-occupied Denmark. This was more than three times the number of people evacuated in the nine-day operation at Dunkirk.\n\nOperations commenced on January 23, 1945. On January 30, \"Wilhelm Gustloff\", \"Hansa\", and the whaling factory ship \"Walter Rau\" left the harbor at Gdynia in occupied Poland, bound for Kiel. \"Hansa\" was forced to return to port with mechanical trouble, but the \"Gustloff\", with more than 10,000 civilians and military personnel aboard, continued. She was torpedoed and sunk by the Soviet submarine \"S-13\" off the Pomeranian coast, with possibly as many as 9,500 fatalities. Those on \"Walter Rau\" eventually made it to Eckernförde.\n\nOn February 9, \"Steuben\" sailed from Pillau with between 3,000 and 4,000 mostly military personnel on board, heading for Swinemünde. She was also sunk by \"S-13\", just after midnight; only 300 survived.\n\nIn early March, a task force composed of the heavy cruiser \"Admiral Scheer\" accompanied by three destroyers and the \"Elbing\"-class torpedo boat were giving cover to a German bridgehead near Wollin. During that operation, naval small craft evacuated over 75,000 soldiers and civilians who had been isolated in that area. They were taken to larger warships and other transports lying offshore. While a number of these transports were sunk, large liners such as \"Deutschland\" got through and carried up to 11,000 soldiers and civilians each.\n\nDuring the night of April 4–5, a flotilla of small boats and landing craft evacuated over 30,000 soldiers and civilians from \"Oxhöfter Kämpe\" and took them to Hela. It is estimated that nearly 265,000 people were evacuated from Danzig (modern Gdańsk) to Hela during the month of April alone.\n\nOn April 15, another large convoy consisting of four liners and other transports left Hela with over 20,000 soldiers and civilians. On April 16, the \"Goya\" was torpedoed and sunk by \"L-3\", with the loss of over 6,000 lives; 183 survived.\nInitially, on his becoming Reich President on May 1, Karl Dönitz was determined to continue the war, going so far as to instruct Colonel General Carl Hilpert that combat troops would have priority in evacuation to Germany from the Courland Pocket. It wasn't until the afternoon of May 6, with British troops practically on his doorstep, that he gave up on that plan.\n\nFrom May 1 to May 8, over 150,000 people were evacuated from the beaches of Hela. At 21:00 on May 8, 1945, the last day of the war, a convoy consisting of 92 large and small vessels left the Latvian city of Liepāja () with 18,000 soldiers and civilians. While several hundred of those who had boarded small ships on the last day of the war or after were captured by Soviet MTBs, evacuations to the west continued for at least a week after all such movements were prohibited by the terms of the German surrender.\n\nShortages plagued the Operation with food and medicine being seen as primary issues for the Nazi administration, causing a trend of elderly and very young children to die on board the rescue ships. Other shortages included only a three-week supply of coal remaining for the sea transport tasks and only a ten-day supply for rail transports to move troops to the front, with fuel being at its lowest levels since the war began.\n\nIn addition to the \"Goya\", \"Wilhelm Gustloff\", and \"General von Steuben\", 158 other merchant vessels were lost during the 15-week course of Operation \"Hannibal\" (January 23 – May 8, 1945).\n"}

The main festival took place in Oakland, California, although sibling festivals were also held in New York City, Atlanta and London.\n\nThe festival was first held in August 2001 (and was known as \"Cypher\") as a part of the East Bay (Oakland) LGBT Pride, following the suggestion of East Bay (Oakland) Pride organizer Pete King. Though King was not a fan of hip hop music or culture, he was familiar with the numerous out queer hip hop artists performing in the San Francisco Bay Area and felt the growing scene was an important component of the LGBT arts community. In June 2001, King approached Juba Kalamka of the group Deep Dickollective about his ideas (including naming the event \"PeaceOUT\") and inquired as to the possibility of organizing the event.\n\nThough at first reticent as a result of what he viewed as racial and class antagonism toward hip hop at mainstream pride events, Kalamka eventually relented, which led to the organization of \"Cypher 2000:One\" by his Deep Dickollective bandmate Tim'm West and London-based DJ Christopher \"Mister Maker\" Harvey, who founded the Gayhiphop.com website in 2000.\n\nThe success of the event led to plans to create a larger scale event in 2002. East Bay Pride sponsored the event until its own dissolution after PeaceOUT 2003, at which time main financial sponsorship and organization was coordinated by Kalamka's micro-label Sugartruck Recordings and Matt Wobensmith of the zine and record label Outpunk and later the Queercorps imprint.\n\nAmong the performers who appeared at the festival were Deep Dickollective, Katastrophe, Tori Fixx, God-des and She, Deadlee, Jen-Ro, Jaycub Perez, Cazwell and soce, the elemental wizard. Numerous performances from the festival are featured in the documentary film \"Pick Up the Mic\", which premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2005.\n\nDespite initial plans to continue with PeaceOUT as a biannual event following the 2007 festival, Kalamka decided to close the event permanently in July 2008.

The Yellow River flooded constantly, and other natural disasters also occurred. At the same time the Yuan dynasty required considerable military expenditure to maintain its vast empire.\n\nThe bubonic plague (aka \"Black Death\") also contributed to the birth of the movement. Other groups or religious sects made an effort to undermine the power of the last Yuan Mongol rulers; these religious movements often warned of impending doom.\n\nThe Red Turban Army (紅巾軍) was originally started by followers of the White Lotus with a mix of Dharmic Chinese religions; such as Benzhuism, Bimoism, Buddhism, Confucism, Dongbaism, Mohism, Taoism, and Wuism; and Gnostic Assyrian religions; such as Manichaeism (明教 \"Míngjiào\"), Mandaeanism, Sabianism and Zoroastrianism; was founded by Guo Zixing (郭子興) to resist the Mongols. The name \"Red Turban\" was used because of their tradition of using red banners and wearing red turbans to distinguish themselves.\n\nThese rebellions began on a sporadic basis, first on the coast of Zhejiang when Fang Guozhen and his men assaulted a group of Yuan officials. After that, the White Lotus society led by Han Shantong in the north of the Yellow River became the centre of anti-Mongol sentiment. A few rebel groups crossed the Yalu River from their base in Liaoning to capture Pyongyang on the Korean Peninsula. This invasion was repelled by Goryeo, under generals Choe Yeong and Yi Seonggye.\n\nIn 1351 the society plotted an armed rebellion, but it was disclosed and Han Shantong was arrested and executed by the Yuan government. After his death Liu Futong (劉福通), a prominent member of the White Lotus, assisted Han's son, Han Lin'er (韓林兒), in succeeding his father and establishing the Red Turban Army. After that, several other Han rebels in the south of the Yangtze River revolted under the name of the Southern Red Turbans. Among the key leaders of the Southern Red Turbans were Xu Shouhui and Chen Youliang. The rebellion was also supported by the leadership of Peng Yingyu (彭瑩玉; 1338) and Zou Pusheng (鄒普勝; 1351).\n\nOne of the more significant Red Turban leaders was Zhu Yuanzhang. At first he followed Guo Zixing, and in fact married Guo's stepdaughter. After Guo's death, Zhu was seen as his successor and took over Guo's army.\n\nBetween 1356 and 1367 Zhu began a series of campaigns seeking to defeat his opponents in the Red Turbans. At first he nominally supported Han Lin'er to stabilize his northern frontier. Then he defeated rivals Chen Youliang, Zhang Shicheng and Fang Guozhen one by one. After rising to dominance, he drowned Han Lin'er. Calling to overthrow the Mongols and restore the Han Chinese, Zhu gained popular support.\n\nIn 1368 Zhu Yuanzhang proclaimed himself emperor in Yingtian, historically known as the Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty. The next year the Ming army captured Dadu, and the rule of the Mongol Yuan dynasty was officially over. China was unified once again under the Han Chinese.\n\nHistorical records commonly portray the Red Turban Army as dealing with captive Yuan officials and soldiers with considerable violence. In his work on violence in rural China, William T. Rowe writes:\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "5601289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5601289", "title": "Royalty Theatre", "text": "Royalty Theatre\n\nThe Royalty Theatre was a small London theatre situated at 73 Dean Street, Soho, which opened in 1840 as Miss Kelly's Theatre and Dramatic School and finally closed to the public in 1938. The architect was Samuel Beazley. The theatre's opening was ill-fated, and it was little used for a decade. It changed its name twice and was used by an opera company, amateur drama companies and for French pieces.\n\nIn 1861, it was renamed the New Royalty Theatre, and the next year it was leased by Mrs Charles Selby, who enlarged it from 200 seats to about 650. The theatre continued to change hands frequently. In the 1860s, it featured F. C. Burnand's burlesque of \"Black-Eyed Susan\", which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by W. S. Gilbert, \"The Merry Zingara\". The theatre was managed by Henrietta Hodson during the early 1870s, who also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's \"The Realm of Joy\" and \"Ought We to Visit Her?\" On 25 March 1875 the Royalty, under the direction of Selina Dolaro, enjoyed an historic success with \"Trial by Jury\".\n\nIn 1877, Kate Santley took control of the theatre, running it for nearly 30 years. She had the theatre rebuilt and it reopened in 1883. In this period, it featured opera-bouffes adapted from the French. M. L. Mayer and plays in French. It was increasingly hard for the theatre to compete with larger new London theatres. In 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama, presenting plays by Ibsen and George Bernard Shaw. When the theatre finally had a great success, with \"Charley's Aunt\" in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to a larger theatre. In 1895–96 the theatre underwent another renovation. Arthur Bourchier's \"The Chili Widow\" ran for over 300 nights. In the new century, Mrs. Patrick Campbell played at the theatre. After another renovation in 1906, Sarah Bernhardt led her own company in a season. In 1912, \"Milestones\", by Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblauch had over 600 performances. \"The Man Who Stayed at Home\" played for 584 performances.\n\nThe Co-Optimists played at the theatre after the war as did Noël Coward's \"The Vortex\". In 1932, \"While Parents Sleep\" was a hit. The theatre closed in 1938 and was demolished in 1953.\n\nThe actress Frances Maria \"Fanny\" Kelly (1790–1882), used the fortune saved from her highly popular career to establish a dramatic academy with a 200-seat theatre attached. The architect of the theatre was Samuel Beazley. The theatre and school were completed in 1837. Kelley's engineer friend, Rowland Macdonald Stephenson, persuaded her to build into the theatre new machinery that he had invented to move the stage and scenery; theoretically a significant step forward in theatre technology. It took more than two years to install the machinery in the theatre. The theatre was \"obscurely sited [and] perilously combustible\", but it had \"a relatively spacious stage, and Beazley's work in the auditorium was thought pretty.\" \"The Times\" described the fashionable little theatre as \"most elegantly fitted up and appointed, and painted in a light tasteful manner.\" \nIt turned out that the machinery was too heavy to be worked by people, and Stephenson had to use a horse. On the opening night, 25 May 1840, three pieces were presented: \"Summer and Winter\", by Morris Barnett; a melodrama, \"The Sergeant's Wife\"; and a farce, \"The Midnight Hour\". The opening was unsuccessful, and within a week the theatre was closed. Kelly's high admission charges of five or seven shillings did not help, but the main problem was that the tramping of the horse and the roar of the machinery drowned out the voices of the actors and caused the building to vibrate. The theatre had to be demolished to remove the machinery. After it was rebuilt, Kelly reopened the theatre in February 1841, at reduced prices, for a season of her own monologues, but then became ill. She sought to lease the theatre, but it was empty for long periods and was used mostly for amateur productions, including one of Charles Dickens's productions. Within a decade, Kelly had lost her entire fortune and was evicted from the property.\n\nIn January 1850 the theatre was reopened as the Royal Soho Theatre, after redecoration by W. W. Deane and S. J. Nicholl, changing its name to the New English Opera House from November 1850, and in the following year an entrance portico was built. Various types of productions played at the theatre, including English Grand Opera. Performances were mostly by amateurs, hiring the theatre at standard rates. At other times, as the Theatre Français, it attracted patrons chiefly among the foreigners in Soho.\nIn 1861, the direction of the theatre was assumed by Albina di Rhona, a Serbian ballerina and comic actress. She renamed it the New Royalty Theatre, and had it altered and redecorated by \"M. Bulot, of Paris, Decorator in Ordinary to his Imperial Majesty, Louis Napoleon\", with \"cut-glass lustres, painted panels, blue satin draperies and gold mouldings\". In the opening programme, di Rhona danced, the leader of the Boston Brass Band from America played a bugle solo, and a melodrama, \"Atar Gull\", was performed, with a 14-year-old Ellen Terry in the cast. Still, the reopening was not a success.\n\nIn 1862, the theatre was leased by, Mrs Charles Selby, who also ran an acting school. She enlarged the original theatre to accommodate about 650 people. She used it to showcase her pupils and occasionally rented it to others. The theatre continued to change hands frequently. It was managed, from 1866 to 1870, by Martha Cranmer Oliver, who featured mostly burlesques, including F. C. Burnand's burlesque of \"Black-Eyed Susan\", which ran for nearly 500 nights, and a burlesque by W. S. Gilbert, \"The Merry Zingara\". The theatre was managed by Henrietta Hodson during the early 1870s. She also produced mostly burlesques and comedies, including Gilbert's \"The Realm of Joy\" and \"Ought We to Visit her?\" In 1872, it became known as the Royalty Theatre and retained this name (although it was occasionally known as the New Royalty Theatre).\n\nOn 25 March 1875 the theatre, under the direction of Madame Selina Dolaro, enjoyed an historic success with \"Trial by Jury\", the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera produced by Richard D'Oyly Carte. It premiered together with Jacques Offenbach's \"La Périchole\" and another one-act farce, \"Cryptoconchoidsyphonostomata\". Carte soon moved his Gilbert and Sullivan company to another theatre. In January 1876 at the Royalty, Pauline Rita appeared under Carte's management as Gustave Muller in \"The Duke's Daughter\".\n\nIn 1877, Kate Santley \"seems to have acquired the head lease.\" She controlled the theatre for nearly 30 years. Carte joined forces with Santley in January 1877 to present \"Lischen and Fritzen\", Jacques Offenbach’s \"Orpheus in the Underworld\", and Carte's own operetta, \"Happy Hampstead\" written with his secretary, Frank Desprez. Later that year, the First Chief Officer of the London Fire Brigade strongly recommended that the theatre be closed. Santley had the theatre rebuilt, hiring architect Thomas Verity, who provided additional exits, and it reopened in 1883, with Santley receiving praise for the renovations. Many of the productions in these years were opera-bouffes adapted from the French. M. L. Mayer, formerly of the Gaiety Theatre, staged twice-yearly seasons of plays in French. The Coquelins and other luminaries of the Comédie-Française appeared here in the 1880s, when the Royalty was 'the recognized home of the Parisian drama.' The opening of Shaftesbury Avenue and of larger new theatres in that neighbourhood, including the Lyric Theatre and the Apollo Theatre, drew audiences away from the Royalty, and in the 1890s the Royalty was not prospering.\nIn 1891, the theatre started a policy of modern drama. Ibsen's \"Ghosts\" premièred, to predictable outrage, at the theatre, in a single private London performance on 13 March 1891. The Lord Chamberlain's Office censorship was avoided by the formation of a subscription-only Independent Theatre Society, which included Thomas Hardy and Henry James among its members. Again, for the Society, George Bernard Shaw premièred \"Widowers' Houses\", his first play, here the following year. When the theatre finally had a great success, with Brandon Thomas’s play \"Charley's Aunt\" in 1892, its popularity led to its transference after only a month to the larger Globe Theatre.\n\nIn 1895–96 the Royalty's manager was Arthur Bourchier, and the theatre underwent another renovation, by architect Walter Emden. Bourchier produced, among other plays, \"The Chili Widow\", an adaptation of his own that ran for over 300 nights. In 1899, the first production of the Incorporated Stage Society took place with the first performance of Shaw's \"You Never Can Tell\". In 1900–01 Mrs. Patrick Campbell hired the theatre and staged a succession of contemporary plays in which she starred, and in 1903–04 Hans Andresen and Max Behrend presented a successful season of German theatre. Also in 1904, the newly founded Irish National Theatre Society gave plays by W. B. Yeats and, in 1905, it presented an early performance of Synge's first play, \"The Shadow of the Glen\". In addition, Philip Carr's Mermaid Society produced Elizabethan and Jacobean plays.\n\nAgain, the theatre was threatened with closure by the authorities, but Santley had it rebuilt again in 1906 to meet safety requirements. After redecoration in French Regency style, which increased the capacity of the theatre to 657 seats, the Royalty reopened on 4 January 1906 with a season of Theatre Français directed by Gaston Mayer. Sarah Bernhardt led her own company in \"La Tosca, Phedre\" and \"La Dame aux Camelias\" in 1907. In 1911, J. E. Vedrenne and Dennis Eadie acquired the theatre, and in 1912, they staged \"Milestones\", by Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblauch (later Knoblock), which had over 600 performances. Owen Nares, Gladys Cooper Lynn Fontanne appeared at the theatre early in their careers. \"The Man Who Stayed at Home\" was a hit at the Royalty in 1914, playing for 584 performances. Henry Daniell starred as Bobby Gilmour in \"The Man from Toronto\" at the theatre in May 1918.\n\nA post-war success was the concert-party entertainment, \"The Co-Optimists\", first staged in 1921. The year 1924 saw the first West End production at the theatre of Noël Coward's \"The Vortex.\" \"Juno and the Paycock\" was mounted in 1925, and Ibsen's \"Pillars of Society\" played in 1926. Another hit for the Royalty was in 1932 with \"While Parents Sleep\". By 1936 the danger of fire from celluloid stores and other adjacent properties overrided the argument made to the Lord Chamberlain that the theatre had been on the site before the development of the inflammatory trades nearby. J. B. Priestley's \"I Have Been Here Before\" was the theatre's last success. The last performance was given at a matinee on 25 November 1938, by the Southern Cross Players.\n\nAlthough several schemes were considered for its rebuilding, but with the growing threat of war, the theatre remained empty and soon became derelict. It was damaged in the World War II Blitz. The Royalty was demolished in 1953 and a block of offices, Royalty House, was erected on the site.\n\nA modern Royalty Theatre was opened in the basement of an office block at Portugal Street near Aldwych in 1960. This was bought by the London School of Economics and renamed the Peacock Theatre in 1996. It is a lecture hall by day and a venue for the Sadler's Wells Theatre company by night.\n\n"}

The song was released as the fourth single from Jackson's 1979 album \"Off the Wall\". In 2004, the song appeared in \"The Ultimate Collection\". It peaked at number 10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, marking the first time any solo artist had ever achieved four Top 10 hits from one album. In America, it earned a million-selling Gold 45. Unlike the album's previous singles, which were all uptempo dance-oriented funk and disco songs, \"She's Out of My Life\" was an emotional ballad. The song has a tempo of 66 beats per minute, making it one of Jackson's slowest songs.\n\nThe song is about a painful breakup. It has been claimed that Bahler wrote the song about Karen Carpenter, whom Bahler had briefly dated. However, he has stated, \"The fact is, I had already written that song by the time Karen and I became romantic. That song was written more about Rhonda Rivera... Rhonda and I had been together for two years, and it was after we broke up that I started dating Karen.\"\n\nThe demo version of the song, which features Jackson singing with a guitar, was released on the second disc of the 2009 album \"Michael Jackson's This Is It\". The song has also been covered by a variety of artists, including Patti LaBelle, Ginuwine, 98°, S Club 7, Barbara Mandrell, Daniel Evans, Nina, Willie Nelson, Josh Groban, and Karel Gott.\n\nJones had originally intended to save the song for Frank Sinatra. However, he wanted Jackson to record material with more mature themes and \"feel the full range of his voice,\" so he decided to bring the song to Jackson's attention.\n\nA poignant moment in the song occurs near the end when Jackson begins to break down in tears as he sings the word \"life\". Although he had attempted to record the song's last few moments with emotional restraint, after numerous tries he continued to end the rendition the same - by breaking down in tears. Producer Quincy Jones subsequently let Jackson's tearful recording stand:\n\"She's Out of My Life\", I'd been carrying around for about three years—you can feel the pain in it, you know. And I held on to it and finally something said 'this is the right moment to give it to Michael'.\n\nAnd when we recorded it with Michael, I know it was an experience he'd never even thought about to sing in a song, 'cause it's a very mature emotion. And he cried at the end of every take, you know. We recorded about—I don't know—8-11 takes, and every one at the end, he just cried, and I said 'hey - that's supposed to be, leave it on there.'\n\n—Quincy Jones, \"Off the Wall\" 2001 Special Edition, \"Quincy Jones Interview 3\"\nIn Jackson's autobiography, \"Moonwalk\", he wrote that the song is about knowing that barriers separating him from others are seemingly easy to overcome, yet they cause him to miss out on what he really desires. He said that he cried from the sudden effect of the words because \"I had been letting so much build up inside me.\" Particularly it reminded him of his feeling of being \"so rich in some experiences while being poor in moments of true joy.\" He worried about this feeling showing up on the song, but also felt \"if it touched people's heartstrings, knowing that would make me feel less lonely.\" He described making \"Off the Wall\" as \"one of the most difficult periods of my life...I had very few close friends at the time and felt very isolated.\" He would walk through his neighborhood, hoping to meet people who didn't know who he was, so he could meet \"somebody who would be my friend because they liked me and needed a friend too, not because I was who I am.\"\n\nThe song peaked at #10 in the United States on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The single was even more successful in the UK and peaked at number 3 on the charts (the equivalent position reached by \"Off the Wall's\" debut single \"Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough\").\n\nGiven the popular response to his emotional rendition, the song remained in Jackson's live set for many years.\n\nAllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the song an \"overwrought ballad\" but praised Jackson's \"blindingly gifted\" singing on the track. Rolling Stone editor Stephen Holden praised: \"The singer's ultradramatic phrasing, which takes huge emotional risks and wins every time, wrings the last drop of pathos from Tom Bahler's tear-jerker, \"She's Out of My Life.\"\n\nA music video was produced to promote the song, which showed Michael in a blue-green shirt, dark pants, and sitting on a barstool with a spotlight shining behind him. The video uses a split screen technique to simultaneously show Jackson from two different angles during the second and third verses. It was directed by Bruce Gowers, who also directed a similar video for Jackson's previous single \"Rock with You.\" The video is shown far less frequently than Jackson's later videos, but it is included on the DVD box set \"Michael Jackson's Vision\", marking its first DVD release. It was parodied in the Dr. PC Man video \"Three Minutes Hour Life\".\n\nThe song was performed during The Jacksons' Triumph Tour and Victory Tour. It was also performed on Jackson's Bad World Tour, the Dangerous World Tour, and the Royal Brunei concert, which also turned out to be the final live performance of the song. The song was also rehearsed as a duet with a female backup vocalist for the first \"Michael Jackson & Friends\" charity concert in Seoul, South Korea, but cancelled for the final performance, which took place ten years to the day before Jackson's death.\n\nThe live performances of the song were featured on the \"\", \"\", and \"\" DVDs. Live audio is available in the \"Live at Wembley July 16, 1988\" CD, included as a bonus on \"Bad 25\", and the 1981 live album, \"The Jacksons Live!\"\n\nJackson would bring a female audience member up on stage with him while performing the song.\n\n\n\n\nJohnny Duncan and Janie Fricke recorded a duet version reworked as \"He's Out Of My Life\", and in 1980 their version reached the top 20 of the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart.\n\n\n\n"}

Front-running drivers from the series usually contested their local World Championship Grand Prix, as well as occasional European events, although they had little success at that level.\n\n1967 also saw a remarkable result by Rhodesian driver John Love with a 2.7 litre four-cylinder Cooper-Climax; Love, who was in his forties and, although seen as one of the finest drivers in Southern Africa, was not a major star, led and finished second in that year's South African Grand Prix. Love's Cooper was originally designed for the short races of the Tasman Series; to run a full Grand Prix Love added two auxiliary gas tanks. Unfortunately the auxiliary tanks' fuel pump failure forced him to refuel after having led most of the race.\n\nLove and Charlton both won the South African Formula One championship for six consecutive seasons, Love from 1964 to 1969 and Charlton from 1970 to 1975. In 1975 Ian Scheckter raced the Tyrrell 007 that had been campaigned by brother, Jody, in the previous year's world championship and won five of the seasons races, including four on the trot. However he only had one other points finish with fifth place at the False Bay \"100\" on 5 July giving him a points total for the season of 47. Charlton proved more consistent with three victories, five second positions to give him a points total for the season of 57. By winning the Natal Spring Trophy at Roy Hesketh Circuit on 1 September Charlton joined Rhodesian John Love as a six times winner of the South African National Drivers Championship. Charlton ended the South African Formula One Championship by winning the final race of the season, the Rand Spring Trophy at Kyalami on 4 October after the faster Scheckter retired with a driveshaft problem.\n\nPrimarily owing to cost and dwindling grids, the Formula One championship was replaced at the end of the 1975 season with Formula Atlantic. The South Africans had tried to build interest by padding the field with Formula 2 and Formula 5000 cars, but viewership was in a steady decline - not helped by a somewhat Byzantine points system. 1976 would see the start of the domination of South Africa's National Championship by Ian Scheckter. Indeed, had it not been for youthful exuberance Scheckter would have won the 1975 title. He won more races than Charlton, but Charlton was more consistent. Scheckter won the first four championship in a row for Lexington Racing before United Tobacco Company withdrew their teams (Lexington, Gunston and Texan). With Gunston returning in 1983, Scheckter returned to the Championship and won a further two championships to join Love and Charlton as six times winners.\n\n"}
{"id": "6154321", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6154321", "title": "The Elements: Fire", "text": "The Elements: Fire\n\n\"Fire\" is an unfinished instrumental written and produced by Brian Wilson for the Beach Boys' \"Smile\" project. It was intended to serve one part of \"The Elements\", a musical suite envisioned for \"Smile\". Believing that the recording contained pyrokinetic abilities, Wilson shelved the track indefinitely, then claiming for many years to have destroyed its master tapes.\n\nThe composition was revisited several months later when \"Fire\" was rerecorded with a minimized arrangement, renamed \"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter (W. Woodpecker Symphony)\", and then published for the Beach Boys' 1967 album \"Smiley Smile\". Under the title \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\", Wilson completed \"Fire\" as a solo artist in 2004 for \"Brian Wilson Presents Smile\". In 2011, the Beach Boys' original 1966 recording was released in several composite forms as \"The Elements: Fire (Mrs. O'Leary's Cow)\" for the compilation \"The Smile Sessions\".\n\nWilson was awarded the Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance, his first, for \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\".\n\nNamed for Catherine O'Leary of the Great Chicago Fire, \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\" was initially composed for the Beach Boys' unreleased album \"Smile\" as the first part of \"The Elements\" suite: Fire. In Brian Wilson's ghostwritten 1991 autobiography \"\", the circumstances of his second LSD trip were detailed. They were purported to have involved ego death as well as death by burning, which has led some to speculate that the track is a musical adaptation of this LSD trip. According to Wilson with Gold, \"It created a disturbing picture that mirrored the screams that had filled my head and plagued my sleep for years.\" In regard to the existence of its master tapes, \"Roughly two minutes of 'Fire' music still exists, locked in the Capitol vaults, where I hope it remains. Not because I still believe it possesses a negative power; that was merely a reflection of how disturbed I was at the time. I hope that segment remains unreleased simply because it's not good music.\"\n\nAt an earlier time, Wilson noted, \"It was sick. Weird chords, it wasn't the straight eight and all that. I started thinking, 'Oh God, I'm flipping here.' But I liked it.\" The music was considered an attempt at \"witchcraft\" by Wilson, who dismissed it simply a product of the group's excessive drug use. British rock journalist Nick Kent described the track as a \"dark, booming, reverb-drenched blur of sound.\" During the 1970s, writer Byron Preiss was lent an acetate disc of the track, calling it \"a mad, impressionistic piece that crept up on you with the emotional chill of a real fire.\" Author Bob Stanley named it a \"terrifying atonal cacophony\". According to \"Wouldn't it Be Nice\", \"the instrumental track was one long, eerie whine. It built slowly, like the beginning of a giant conflagration, and grew so intense it was possible to picture the kindling catching, spreading, and being whipped by the wind into a raging, out-of-control inferno ... The weirdest was the crash and crackle of instruments smoldering for the final time. Listening to the playback, I began to feel unnerved by the music, strange and eerie.\"\n\nPresent at the instrumental's tracking on November 28, 1966 was Danny Hutton, Frank J. Holmes, and Dennis Wilson, who filmed Brian as he produced the recording. Other attendants included wife-of-Brian Marilyn Wilson, sister-in-law Diane Rovell, and Beach Boys roadie Arnie Geller. Van Dyke Parks avoided this session \"like the plague\" due to what he perceived as Brian's regressive behavior during the period. It was recorded under unusual conditions. Wilson instructed Geller to purchase several dozen fire helmets at a local toy store so that everybody in the studio could don them during its recording. Wilson also had the studio's janitor bring in a bucket with burning wood so that the studio would be filled with the smell of smoke. After twenty-four takes, attempts by Wilson were made to record the crackling noises made by the burning wood and mix them into the track. An account of the famous \"Fire\" story was first reported and published in October 1967:\nAnother story which circulates involves Wilson attempting to set fire to the tapes only to find that they refuse to ignite, which further frightens him. Al Jardine explained from his point of view: \"I wasn't at that session but I think Carl was there. Yeah, there was the rumor that he burned all the tapes. You can’t burn tape, that’s just a myth. We tried it once, because of the rumor that Brian has burned the tapes, and I wanted to see if that would work. We were finishing a song for \"Surf’s Up\" and we had some outtakes from the album and I put a match to it, and it wouldn't burn. The tapes weren't burned, and needless to say they do exist for the \"Smile\" sessions.\"\n\nOn a 1978 \"Robert W. Morgan Special of the Week\" radio program, Dennis recalled how he had recently played the \"Fire\" tape for Brian, and that a day later, an electrical fire broke out at the Record Plant in Los Angeles, destroying the Studio C room.\n\nIn addition to \"Fire\" session highlights, a digital mashup of the Beach Boys' wordless \"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter\" vocals and the \"Fire\" backing track was eventually released in 2011 as disc 1, track 17 on \"The Smile Sessions\" box-set.\n\nAs a solo artist, Wilson revisited \"Fire\" under the title \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\". Still in fear of the track, Wilson left its string arrangement to collaborator Darian Sahanaja, who explained: \"I think that's the part that spooked him the most. I told him I'd deal with it.\" Wilson also instructed that the vocals be modeled from \"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter\". Although he ended up performing vocals, Wilson avoided attending his band's rehearsals of the track. Ultimately, this was to their relief, as a power outage occurred by happenstance in mid-rehearsal as though to signal a bad omen. Sahanaja speculates that if Wilson had been present for this occurrence, \"Smile\" would have been cancelled for the second time. \"Mrs. O'Leary's Cow\" was released in 2004 for \"Brian Wilson Presents Smile\".\n\n"}

Located at 282 Hope Street, its front door was originally round the corner in Cowcaddens Street. It currently accommodates 1,541 people. The theatre opened in 1867, adopting the name Theatre Royal two years later. It is also the birthplace of Howard & Wyndham Ltd, owners and managers of theatres in Scotland and England until the 1970s, created by its chairman Baillie Michael Simons in 1895. It was Simons who as a cultural entrepreneur of his day also promoted the building of Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and Glasgow's International Exhibitions of 1888 (the International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry) and 1901.\n\nThe theatre was opened in 1867 as the Royal Colosseum and Opera House by James Baylis. Baylis also ran the Milton Colosseum Music Hall at Cowcaddens Cross, and had opened the Scotia Music Hall , later known as the Metropole , in Stockwell Street in 1862. The Royal, and its shops and adjoining Alexandra Music Hall, were designed by George Bell of Clarke & Bell, who became the founding President of the Glasgow Institute of Architects.\n\nBaylis presented a range of performance activity in its auditorium: pantomimes, plays, comedies, harlequinades and opera. This early mention of opera seems significant given the theatre’s later role since 1975 as the home of Scottish Opera. Despite the financial importance of pantomime, then as now, opera in the time of Baylis was still viable as a commercial venture. The Mitchell Library`s archives record that other venues in Glasgow performed opera – in 1868 there were 76 performances of 23 different operas; and recent research increasingly underlines its presence down the years. Many operas, both famous and forgotten, had their Scottish premiere at the Theatre Royal. Certainly among surviving Scottish theatres, in this respect the Theatre Royal is head and shoulders above others even on the basis of a selective listing.\nIn 1869 Baylis leased the theatre to Glover & Francis who previously ran the old Theatre Royal in Dunlop Street, which had been demolished to make way for St Enoch railway station. William Glover brought the name Theatre Royal with him and its company of artistes, orchestra and stage staff, presenting drama, opera, revues and pantomime.\n\nIn 1879 the auditorium was destroyed by fire and was rebuilt to the classical French Renaissance design seen today of the renowned theatre architect Charles J. Phipps, creating three galleries instead of two and making the front door face Hope Street instead of Cowcaddens Road. It continued to accommodate about 3,000 people. It is now the largest surviving example of Charles Phipp's theatre work in Britain.\n\nIn the early 1880s a number of managers ran it until Baillie Michael Simons arranged for it to be made available to two actor managers, James Howard and Fred Wyndham, in 1888. They announced that in addition to plays, opera, musicals and summer revues it would be known above all as a pantomime house, their first being The Forty Thieves. The new company, Howard & Wyndham, went on to produce pantomimes across Britain for almost 80 years. Howard & Wyndham also presented from the 1930s onwards the famous Half Past Eight Shows which later became the record-breaking Five Past Eight Shows. They were not operators of music-halls nor presented variety, which was the forte of Moss Empires.\n\nIn 1895 the company became Howard & Wyndham Ltd, quoted on Stock Exchanges, and growing to own and operate the largest group of quality theatres in Scotland and England, with the Royal as its flagship. In the same year a fire destroyed the auditorium again, but was rebuilt six months later under the attention of Charles Phipps with few visible changes. Howard & Wyndham Ltd soon added to their stock of theatres by building the Frank Matcham designed King’s Theatre across the city centre in 1904.\n\nIn 1957, the theatre was sold to Scottish Television in a joint venture with Howard & Wyndham Ltd (who moved their own shows to their new flagship the Alhambra Theatre in Waterloo Street) for conversion of the Royal into a Scottish Television Theatre, studios and offices, becoming the main home for the commercial ITV network in central Scotland. Live performances in music, dance and comedy were transmitted across Scotland and networked to ITV areas south of the border. STV also transmitted concerts and operas from other venues and became the first and largest sponsors of Scottish Opera started by Sir Alexander Gibson in 1962\n\nIn 1974, Scottish Television moved to custom-built premises next door and offered the Theatre Royal to Scottish Opera who bought it with public support, converting it to become its home theatre and Scotland's first national opera house. A major rebuild and refurbishment ensued, involving the creation of an enlarged foyer, new main staircase, orchestra pit enlarged to accommodate 100 players, extended backstage areas and modernised dressing rooms. The auditorium was restored to its full glory and plasterwork once more in its original cream and gold and colour highlights, with the ornate ceiling picked out in its original colours of gold, cream and pale blue. William Morris wallpaper was added to the principal walls. It re-opened in October 1975 with a gala performance of \"Die Fledermaus\", televised live.\n\nA few months later the Theatre Royal also became the home theatre of Scottish Ballet started in 1969, and became the main home of the Scottish Theatre Company during its existence in the 1980s. It became a principal venue of the city's Mayfest Festival each year, and continues to attract visiting companies. Since 1977 it has been protected as a category A listed building of architectural and historic importance.\nIt is the largest example of Charles Phipps' architecture in Britain.\n\nIn 1997 a lottery-funded refurbishment allowed for extensive rewiring and redecoration. Cherry red walls, turquoise seating, and red and turquoise carpeting replaced the 1975 scheme. In 2005 Scottish Opera leased the theatre management to the Ambassador Theatre Group, although the building continues to be the performance home of Scottish Opera, and of Scottish Ballet.\n\nFunding from the Scottish Government, Heritage Lottery and others from 2012 onwards enabled Scottish Opera to build new foyers at the corner of Hope Street and Cowcaddens, partly on the site of the former Alexandra Music Hall. Costing £14m, it opened in December 2014 and is a largely elliptical building, containing new entrances, foyers, bars, cafe, hospitality areas, education space and heritage exhibition areas together with lifts to all levels, including an open roof terrace, and centred by an open spiral staircase.\n\nWhen winning the design competition, the architects Page & Park observed: \n\n\nNotes\n"}

In the synoptic gospels, Jesus sends two disciples ahead to \"the village over against\" them in order to retrieve a donkey (or, in Matthew, two animals: a donkey and a colt) that had been tied up but never ridden, and if questioned, to say that the donkey was needed by the Lord (or Master) but would be returned.\n\nJesus then rode the donkey into Jerusalem, with the three Synoptic gospels stating that the disciples had first put their cloaks on it (presumably to make it more comfortable). Matthew 21:7 maintains that the disciples laid their cloaks on both animals: \"they brought the donkey and the colt, laid their clothes on them, and set Him\" (or \"he sat\") \"on them\". Heinrich Meyer suggests that \"they spread their outer garments upon both animals, being uncertain which of them Jesus intended to mount\".\nIn as Jesus approaches Jerusalem, he looks at the city and weeps over it (an event known as Flevit super illam in Latin), foretelling the suffering that awaits the city.\n\nThe Gospels go on to recount how Jesus rode into Jerusalem, and how the people there laid down their cloaks in front of him and also laid down small branches of trees. The people sang part of : \"Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord. We bless you from the house of the Lord ...\".\n\nOn his entry into the city, Matthew's account suggests that Jesus evoked great excitement - \"all the city was moved\" - but also that Jesus may not have been known to the people of Jerusalem: the people of the city asked \"Who is this?\" and \"the multitudes\" (, \"hoi ochloi\") answered, \"This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee”.\n\nThe word \"moved\" in the Greek text is \"ἐσείσθη\" (\"eseisthē\"), derived from σεισμός (\"seismos\"). The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges suggests \"the word in the original is forcible, “convulsed” or “stirred” as by an earthquake, or by a violent wind\". Matthew uses the same word in when he suggests that the earth \"quaked\" at the time of Jesus' death.\n\nIn the Synoptic Gospels, this episode is followed by the Cleansing of the Temple episode and, in all four Gospels, Jesus performs various healings and teaches by way of parables while in Jerusalem until the Last Supper.\n\nTraditionally, entering the city on a donkey symbolizes arrival in peace, rather than as a war-waging king arriving on a horse.\n\nThe Synoptics (Mc chapter 14; Mt 26) refers to Jesus visiting the home of an unknown woman of Bethany, where she anointed his \"head\" with a precious oil, in forecast of his burial. The event was placed in the house of Simon the Leper (\"Simon\" in Luke), and dated after the entry in Jerusalem (Mc 11), before the sundown and preceding by two days the Passover.\n\nThe synoptics differ with the anointing of Jesus as referred in the John 12, who named Mary, sister of Lazarus, while anointing the \"feet\" of Jesus at a dinner in his honour in her home. Lastly, John dated the event at the day before first Jesus' entry in Jerusalem (less than two miles from Bethany, as in John 11), and six days preceding the Passover.\n\n refers to a passage from Book of Zechariah () and states:\n\nThe location of the Mount of Olives is significant in the Old Testament in that and stated that the Messiah would come to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives:\n\nThe triumphal entry and the palm branches, resemble the celebration of Jewish liberation in 1 Maccabees (13:51) which states:\n\nJesus' entry on a donkey has a parallel in which states that:\n\nThe symbolism of the donkey may also refer to the Eastern tradition that it is an animal of peace, versus the horse, which is an animal of war. Therefore, a king came riding upon a horse when he was bent on war and rode upon a donkey when he wanted to point out that he was coming in peace. Therefore, Jesus' entry to Jerusalem symbolized his entry as the Prince of Peace, not as a warmongering king.\n\n"}

The event is a program of the Utah Pride Center, and includes the state's second-largest parade, after the Days of '47 Parade.\n\nThe festival includes the parade, a film festival, the Dyke March, members of the Bear Clan, Leathermen, and the Sisters of bondage subcultures, an interfaith service by the Utah Pride Interfaith Coalition, 5K charity run, and related parties and receptions.\n\nParticipation in the festival cuts across a broad spectrum of Utahns. Past speakers during the celebration have ranged from Salt Lake City Mayor Rocky Anderson, who was quoted in support of same sex marriage, to Utah Rep. Jackie Biskupski, the state's first openly lesbian legislator (and now Salt Lake City's first openly lesbian mayor).\n\nThe festival's last day (Sunday) begins with the parade. Participants have included Mayor Ralph Becker, County Mayor Ben McAdams, a group of uniformed Boy Scouts, the largest group - Mormons Building Bridges, Mormons for Equality, the Provo Pride Council, Westminster College (Utah), and Weber State University. Over 140 organizations, sponsors, and religious groups participate. A large rainbow flag fills the street at the back of the parade.\n\nThe festival began in 1977 when the Salt Lake Coalition for Human Rights sponsored a three-day conference. (then called Gay Mormons United) was founded during this conference, on June 11. The 1978 keynote speakers were David Kopay, the first NFL player to come out of the closet, and U.S. Air Force Sgt. Leonard Matlovich, an ex-Mormon who was the first openly gay person to appear on the cover of \"Time\" magazine.\n\nUtah Pride Inc. was created in 1989 through 2004 as a project of the Gay and Lesbian Community Council of Utah. The project was renamed Pride of Utah in 2006.\n\nThe first Pride parade in the state was held June 27, 1990 at the state capitol building. It began on the steps of the capitol, went down Main street, and ended on South Temple at the Utah Museum of Contemporary Art (then the Salt Lake Art Center). It included a procession of 270. In 1991, the Utah Stonewall Center opened and Pride festivities moved to the Salt Lake County Fairgrounds in Murray, Utah. The parade attracted twice as many participants along with opposition by members of the Aryan Nation. The Pride Day Art Expo and Competition was created to award local artists with its Lesbian and Gay Pride Art Award and the Mapplethorpe Award.\n\nIn 1997, a football-field long pride flag was made to carry down the parade route. It was produced by Rev. Bruce Barton of the Metropolitan Community Church of Salt Lake City, UT along with a dozen helpers (including Jeff Freedman, Bruce Harmon, Carrie Gaylor, Lynn Gillman and Garth Snyder) whom called it, a \"tremendous symbol of pride and unity\". Completed the day of the parade (June 8 at 4:15 am), it was composed of 35 bolts of lightweight fabric in 6 colors, and took more than 80 hours to sew this 300 foot long flag. Over 100 marchers would hold the sides; people often threw donations onto the flag and children would run around underneath. In 2012, the original flag had seen better days and a new one from Colonial Flag was purchased for $5,000. It is 30x200 feet, made of nylon with hand holds every 18\". Also, UPC gifted Moab Pride their own 100' flag.\n\nIn 2004, an estimated 50,000 people attended, the largest since the festival began.

{"id": "33604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33604", "title": "War of the Spanish Succession", "text": "War of the Spanish Succession\n\nThe War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) was a European conflict of the early 18th century, triggered by the death of the childless Charles II of Spain in November 1700. His closest heirs were members of the Austrian Habsburg and French Bourbon families; acquisition of an undivided Spanish Empire by either threatened the European balance of power.\n\nCharles left an undivided Spanish Monarchy to Louis XIV's grandson Philip, who was proclaimed King of Spain on 16 November 1700. Disputes over separation of the Spanish and French crowns and commercial rights led to war in 1701 between the Bourbons of France and Spain and the Grand Alliance, whose candidate was Archduke Charles, younger son of Emperor Leopold.\n\nBy the end of 1706, Allied victories in Italy and the Low Countries forced the French back within their borders but they were unable to make a decisive breakthrough. Control of the sea allowed the Allies to conduct successful offensives in Spain, but lack of popular support for Archduke Charles meant they could not hold territory outside the coastal areas. \n\nWhen his elder brother Joseph died in 1711, Charles succeeded him as Emperor, undermining the primary driver behind the war, which was to prevent Spain being united with either France or Austria. The 1710 British election returned a new government committed to ending it and with the Allied war effort now dependent on British financing, this eventually forced the others to make peace. The war ended with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, followed in 1714 by the treaties of Rastatt and Baden.\n\nIn return for confirmation as King of Spain, Philip V renounced his place in the line of succession to the French throne, both for himself and his descendants; Spain retained the bulk of its possessions outside Europe, while its territories in Italy and the Netherlands were divided between Austria, Britain and Savoy. The Dutch Republic was granted its Barrier Fortresses, while France acknowledged the Protestant succession in Britain and agreed to end support for the Stuart exiles. \n\nIn the longer term, the commercial provisions of Utrecht confirmed Britain's status as the leading European maritime and commercial power. Others included the decline of the Dutch Republic as a first-rank power, the creation of a centralised Spanish state and the acceleration of the break-up of the Holy Roman Empire into larger and more powerful German principalities.\n\nIn 1665 Charles II became the last male Habsburg King of Spain; suffering from ill-health all his life, his death was anticipated almost from birth and his successor debated for decades. In 1670, England agreed to support the rights of Louis XIV to the Spanish throne in the Treaty of Dover, while the terms of the 1688 Grand Alliance committed England and the Dutch Republic to back Leopold.\n\nIn 1700, the Spanish Empire included possessions in Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, the Philippines and the Americas and though no longer the dominant great power, it remained largely intact. Since acquisition of the Empire by either the Austrian Habsburgs or French Bourbons would change the balance of power in Europe, its inheritance led to a war that involved most of the European powers. The 1700-1721 Great Northern War is considered a connected conflict, since it impacted the involvement of states such as Sweden, Saxony, Denmark–Norway and Russia.\n\nDuring the 1688-1697 Nine Years War, armies had increased in size from an average of 25,000 in 1648 to over 100,000 by 1697, a level unsustainable for pre-industrial economies. The 1690s also marked the lowest point of the Little Ice Age, a period of colder and wetter weather that drastically reduced crop yields. The Great Famine of 1695-1697 killed between 15-25% of the population in present-day Scotland, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Norway and Sweden, with an estimated two million deaths in France and Northern Italy. \n\nThe 1697 Treaty of Ryswick was therefore the result of mutual exhaustion and Louis XIV's acceptance that France could not achieve its objectives without allies. Leopold initially refused to sign and did so with extreme reluctance in October 1697; by now, Charles' health was clearly failing and with the Succession unresolved, the signatories viewed Ryswick as a pause in hostilities.\n\nUnlike France or Austria, the Crown of Spain could be inherited through the female line. This allowed Charles' sisters Maria Theresa (1638–1683) and Margaret Theresa (1651–1673) to pass their rights as rulers onto the children of their respective marriages with Louis XIV and Emperor Leopold.\n\nDespite being opponents in the recent Nine Years War, Louis XIV and William III of England now attempted to resolve the Succession by diplomacy. In 1685, Maria Antonia (1669–1692), daughter of Leopold and Margaret, married Maximillian Emanuel of Bavaria and they had a son, Joseph Ferdinand. The 1698 Treaty of the Hague or First Partition Treaty between France, Britain and the Dutch Republic made the six year old heir to the bulk of the Spanish Monarchy and divided its European territories between France and Austria.\n\nThe Spanish refused to accept the division of their Empire and on 14 November 1698, Charles published his Will, making Joseph Ferdinand heir to an independent and undivided Spanish monarchy. When he died of smallpox in February 1699, a new solution was required; this was provided by his mother Maria Antonia, who in 1685 transferred her claim to the Spanish throne to Leopold's sons, Joseph and Archduke Charles. This was of doubtful legality but France, Britain and the Netherlands used it to devise the 1700 Treaty of London; Archduke Charles became the new heir, with Spanish possessions in Europe split between France, Savoy and Austria.\n\nLeopold refused to agree the provisions of the Treaty giving France most of Italy while Spain continued to insist on an undivided monarchy. Charles amended his Will in favour of Archduke Charles but on 2 October, replaced him with Louis' grandson Philip, Duke of Anjou. If Philip refused, his younger brother, the duc de Berry was next, followed by Archduke Charles.\n\nCharles died on 1 November 1700 and Louis received the offer on 9th, giving him the option to accept or insist on the Treaty of London. The latter would in theory give the throne to Archduke Charles but if Leopold continued to refuse the territorial concessions, Louis could demand Britain and the Dutch join him in enforcing the Treaty, leaving Austria isolated. However, French diplomats advised the anti-French mood of the Habsburg court meant war either way, while Britain and the Dutch would neither fight for nor against Austria. On balance, this made it preferable to accept the offer and on 16 November, Philip of Anjou was proclaimed Philip V of Spain.\n\nWith most of his objectives achieved by diplomacy, Louis now made a series of moves that combined to make war inevitable.\nThe Tory majority in the English Parliament would not fight for Spain or the Dutch and preferred the provisions of Charles' will to the Partition Treaties. However, a foreign diplomat observed this was true 'so long as English commerce does not suffer.' Louis either failed to appreciate this or decided to ignore it and his actions gradually eroded Tory opposition.\n\nIn early 1701, Louis registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris Parlement, raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, the Spanish-controlled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy announced their support for Philip and accepted French troops. Combined with efforts to build an alliance between France and Imperial German states in Swabia and Franconia, these were challenges Leopold could not ignore.\n\nAt the same time, French garrisons took over Dutch-held 'Barrier' fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands, helped by the Spanish Viceroy and French ally Max Emanuel of Bavaria. This undid Dutch gains made at Ryswick and threatened their lucrative monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of Münster. It was also a concern to English merchants since control of the ports of Antwerp and Ostend allowed France to blockade the Channel at will. Combined with other French actions potentially damaging to English trade, this produced a clear majority for war and in May 1701, Parliament urged William to negotiate an anti-French alliance. \n\nOn 7 September, Leopold, the Dutch Republic and Britain signed the Treaty of The Hague renewing the 1689 Grand Alliance. Its provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier in the Spanish Netherlands, the Protestant succession in England and Scotland and an independent Spain but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne. \n\nWar became inevitable when the exiled James II died on 16 September and Louis reneged on his earlier recognition of the Protestant William III as King of England and Scotland by acknowledging the Catholic Stuart heir, James Francis Edward as King. When William died in March 1702, his successor Queen Anne confirmed her continuation of securing the Protestant succession and resisting French expansion. The Dutch did the same and on 15 May the Grand Alliance declared war on France, followed by the Imperial Diet on 30 September.\n\nEconomic: The importance of trade and economic interests to the participants is often under estimated; contemporaries viewed Dutch and English support for the Habsburg cause as primarily driven by a desire for access to the Spanish American markets.\n\nModern economics generally assumes a constantly growing market whereas the then dominant theory of Mercantilism viewed it as static. As a result, increasing your share of trade implied taking it from someone else, with the government's role being to restrict foreign competition. Trade was often used as a policy weapon; between 1690-1704, English import duties increased by 400%, while the 1651-1663 Navigation Acts were a major factor in the Anglo-Dutch Wars. On 6 September 1700, France banned the import of English manufactured goods like cloth and imposed prohibitive duties on a wide range of others.\n\nMilitary: the armies engaged in the Nine Years War often exceeded 100,000 men and proved too large for the pre-industrial economies of its participants. Those of 1701-1714 averaged around 35,000 - 50,000 but a dependence on water-borne transport accentuated the importance of rivers like the Rhine in Germany or the Adda in Northern Italy. Reliance on the local countryside for resupply limited operations in poor areas like Northern Spain; these factors confined campaigns to the same general areas.\n\nAlignment on reducing the power of France and securing the Protestant succession masked differences on how to achieve them. In general, the Tories favoured a mercantilist strategy of using the Royal Navy to attack French and Spanish trade while protecting and expanding their own; land commitments were viewed as expensive and primarily of benefit to others. The Whigs argued France could not be defeated by seapower alone, making a Continental strategy essential. Britain's financial strength made it the only member of the Alliance able to operate on all fronts against France.\n\nThe Dutch provided much of the manpower for the campaigns in the Low Countries; while Marlborough was accepted as the Allied commander, in the early years strategy in that theatre was subject to their approval. Dutch priorities were to re-stablish and strengthen the Barrier fortresses, retain control of the Scheldt estuary and gain access to trade in the Spanish Empire.\nDespite Austria being the seat of the Holy Roman Empire, Austrian and Imperial interests did not always coincide. For much of the war, the Austrian Habsburgs focused on securing their southern borders in northern Italy and suppressing Rákóczi's War of Independence in Hungary. Putting Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne was not an explicit objective for them. The crucial campaign in Spain was reliant on the so-called \"Maritime Powers\" (England and the Dutch Republic) and also a higher priority for them.\n\nBy formalising religious divisions within the Empire, the 1648 Peace of Westphalia weakened its integrity and by 1700, the larger German states were pursuing their own policies. Bavaria allied itself with France while as King of Poland, Augustus of Saxony was fully occupied by the Great Northern War. To gain Frederick of Prussia's support, Leopold recognised him as King, with Prussia made an equal member of the Grand Alliance. Elector George of Hanover was more reliable, given his position as heir to the British throne but the suspicion remained the interests of Hanover came first. The role played by many of the minor German states and neutrals like Denmark was primarily in hiring out their troops to members of the Grand Alliance.\n\nFrance Under Louis XIV, France was the most powerful state in Europe with revenue-generating capacities that far exceeded its rivals. Its geographical position provided enormous tactical flexibility, unlike Austria it had its own navy and as the campaigns of 1708-10 proved, even under severe pressure it could defend its borders. The Nine Years War had shown France could not impose its objectives without support but the alliance with Spain and Bavaria made a successful outcome far more likely. Apart from denying an undivided Spanish Monarchy to others, Louis' objectives were to secure his borders with Germany, weaken Austria and increase French commercial strength by access to the Americas trade.\n\nSpain Their key objective was as far as possible to preserve an undivided and independent Monarchy. During the 17th century, a series of wars with France drained military and financial resources, with the economy subject to long periods of low productivity and depression. The Spanish monarchy was a personal union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon, each with very different political cultures. The combination of weak central control, war and a depressed economy meant government finances were in perpetual crisis.\n\nSavoy During the Nine Years War, Savoy joined the Grand Alliance in 1690 before agreeing a separate peace with France in 1696. The Duchy was strategically important as it provided access to the southern borders of Austria and France. Philip's accession as King of Spain in 1701 placed Savoy between the Spanish-ruled Duchy of Milan and France, while the Savoyard County of Nice and County of Savoy were in Transalpine France and very difficult to defend.\n\nVictor Amadeus II allied with France in 1701 but his long-term goal was the acquisition of Milan; neither France, Austria or Spain would relinquish this voluntarily, leaving Britain as the only power that could. After the Royal Navy established control over the Western Mediterranean in 1703, Savoy changed sides.\n\nThe war was fought over the Spanish-ruled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy considered essential to the security of Austria's southern borders. In 1701, French garrisons occupied Milan and Mantua and Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy, allied with France, his daughter Maria Luisa marrying Philip V. In May 1701, an Imperial army under Prince Eugene of Savoy moved into Northern Italy; by February 1702, victories at Carpi, Chiari and Cremona forced the French behind the Adda river.\nVendôme, one of the best French generals, took command and was substantially reinforced; Prince Eugene managed a draw at the Battle of Luzzara but the French recovered most of the territory lost the year before. In October 1703, Victor Amadeus declared war on France; by May 1706, the French held most of Savoy except Turin while victories at Cassano and Calcinato forced the Imperialists into the Trentino valley\n\nHowever, in July 1706 Vendôme and any available forces were sent to reinforce France's northern frontier after the defeat at Ramillies. Reinforced by German auxiliaries, Prince Eugene marched on Turin and the siege was broken by the Battle of Turin on 7 September. Despite a minor French victory at Castiglione, the war in Italy was over; the Convention of Milan in March 1707 confirmed Austria's control of Milan and Mantua, with French troops given free passage back to France for redeployment elsewhere.\n\nAn attack by forces from Italy on the French base of Toulon was planned for 1707 but was postponed when 10,000 Imperial troops were diverted in June to seize the Spanish Bourbon Kingdom of Naples. The delays contributed to the failure of the siege of Toulon; by the end of 1707, fighting in Italy ceased apart from attempts by Victor Amadeus to recover his trans-Alpine territories of Nice and Savoy.\n\nThe first objective for the Grand Alliance in this theatre was to secure the Dutch frontiers, threatened by the alliance between France, Bavaria and Joseph Clemens, ruler of Liège and Cologne. During 1702, the Barrier fortresses were retaken along with Kaiserswerth, Venlo, Roermond and Liège. The 1703 campaign was marred by Allied conflicts over strategy; they failed to take Antwerp, while the Dutch defeat at Ekeren in June led to bitter recriminations.\n\nOn the Upper Rhine, Imperial forces under Louis of Baden remained on the defensive, although they took Landau in 1702. Over the course of 1703, French victories at Friedlingen, Höchstädt and Speyerbach with the capture of Kehl, Breisach and Landau directly threatened Vienna.\n\nIn 1704, Franco-Bavarian forces continued their advance with the Austrians struggling to suppress Rákóczi's revolt in Hungary. To relieve the pressure, Marlborough marched up the Rhine, joined forces with Louis of Baden and Prince Eugene and crossed the Danube on 2 July. Allied victory at Blenheim on 13 August forced Bavaria out of the war and the Treaty of Ilbersheim placed it under Austrian rule.\n\nAllied efforts to exploit their victory in 1705 foundered on poor co-ordination, tactical disputes and command rivalries, while Leopold's ruthless rule in Bavaria caused a brief but vicious peasant revolt. In May 1706 an Allied force under Marlborough shattered a French army at the Battle of Ramillies; as French numbers had been maximised by stripping garrisons from the Spanish Netherlands, the entire province fell to the Allies in under two weeks.\n\nThis eliminated French offensive capabilities for the rest of the war but despite taking key strongpoints like Lille, the Allies were unable to make a decisive breach in the French frontiers. An internal revolt in early 1708 led to the temporary loss of parts of the Spanish Netherlands; this was restored by victory at Oudenarde in July but the overall position remained largely unchanged from 1706.\n\nVictory in Spain was vital if Archduke Charles were to win the throne but the Habsburgs viewed Northern Italy and suppressing the Hungarian revolt as higher priorities. Anglo-Dutch involvement was driven by the mercantilist strategy of securing trade in the Mediterranean and gaining commercial access to the Spanish Empire. This made Spain more important to the Dutch and English than Austria and dependent on their support, a conflict that was never really solved.\n\nSpain was a union between the Crowns of Castile and Aragon, with Aragon then divided into the Principality of Catalonia plus the Kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sicily, Naples and Sardinia. Majorca, Naples, Sicily and Sardinia declared for Philip in 1701; a mixture of anti-Castilian and anti-French sentiment meant Catalonia, most of Aragon and Valencia supported Archduke Charles but this simplifies a very complex reality. \n\nAnglo-Dutch strategy required a naval base in the area; the attack on Cádiz in September 1702 ended in failure but victory at Vigo Bay in October persuaded Peter II of Portugal to abandon the Bourbons and join the Grand Alliance in May 1703. This gave the Allies access to Lisbon and in March 1704, the newly crowned Charles III of Spain arrived in Portugal to begin a land campaign.\n\nIn May 1704, a Bourbon army won a series of minor victories along the Spain/Portugal border, offset by the Allied capture of Gibraltar, a vital strategic possession. Attempts to retake it were defeated at the naval Battle of Málaga in August, with a land siege being abandoned in April 1705.\n\nIn June 1705, the 'Pact of Genoa' between Catalan representatives and England opened a second front in the north-east; the loss of Barcelona and Valencia left Toulon as the only major port available to the Bourbons in the Western Mediterranean. Philip tried to retake Barcelona in May 1706 but was repulsed, his absence allowing an Allied force from Portugal to enter Madrid and Zaragossa. The Allies could not be resupplied so far from their bases and had to withdraw; by November, Philip controlled Castile, Murcia and parts of Valencia.\n\nAttempts to regain the initiative in 1707 ended with Allied defeats at Almansa in April and Toulon in August, once again restricting Archduke Charles to Catalonia. The British capture of Menorca in 1708 combined with possession of Gibraltar gave them control of the Western Mediterranean. By the end of 1708, British objectives had largely been achieved, Portugal and the Dutch Republic were financially exhausted while Austria refused to commit significant resources to putting Charles on the throne of Spain.\n\nBy the end of 1708, the war had reached stalemate; the French had withdrawn from Northern Italy, with Austria gaining the Spanish possessions of Milan and Naples. In the Low Countries, Ramillies and Oudenarde gave the Maritime Powers control of the Spanish Netherlands and secured the borders of the Dutch Republic; in the Mediterranean, Britain's Royal Navy had achieved naval supremacy and permanent bases in Gibraltar and Menorca.\n\nHowever, France's frontiers remained largely intact while the Grand Alliance had been unable to make any lasting progress in Spain, where Philip proved to be far more popular with the Spanish than the Austrian candidate Archduke Charles. Many of the objectives originally set out by the Grand Alliance in 1701 had been achieved but the victories of 1706 made them overconfident, resulting in the continuation of a war most participants wanted to end but could not.\n\nFrance began peace talks with the Dutch in 1705, viewing them as the most likely to favour a quick end to the war; Ramillies increased this by removing the direct military threat to the Dutch Republic and highlighting Allied differences on the Spanish Netherlands. Ultimately, these made little progress since the Allies had agreed to negotiate jointly, not separately and they were unable to reach internal agreement on the terms.\n\nThe winter of 1708 in Europe was one of the coldest on record, with widespread crop failures and famine exacerbated in France and Spain by a British naval blockade of grain imports. The French re opened talks and in May 1709, the Allies presented the terms known as the Preliminaries of Hague; they included the demand Philip cede his throne to Archduke Charles without compensation and France assist in his removal by force if this was not done within two months. This assumed Philip would abdicate on request and the Spanish accept Archduke Charles while seriously under-estimating France's ability to resist. Louis was willing to abandon Spain but not make war on his own grandson; when it became public, the demand was considered so offensive that it strengthened French resolve to fight on.\n\nMarlborough now launched an offensive in Northern France which led to the Battle of Malplaquet on 11 September 1709 between an Allied army of 86,000 and a French of 75,000. Victory cost the Allies over 20,000 casualties, demonstrated the fighting ability of the French army remained intact and increased war-weariness both in Britain and the Dutch Republic, who suffered heavy losses. This was compounded by the Bourbon recapture of Alicante in April and the defeat of an Anglo-Portuguese force at La Gudina in May.\n\nLack of progress accentuated the reality that the Allies no longer shared clear objectives, highlighted by Dutch exclusion from an agreement between Britain and Archduke Charles for trading rights in Spanish America. The British government compensated with the 1709 First Barrier Treaty; this gave the Dutch effective control of the Spanish Netherlands but was seen as detrimental to British commerce and increased domestic opposition.\n\nThe Whigs won the 1708 British general election by arguing military victory was the quickest road to peace but failure in France was followed by the same in Spain. Archduke Charles re-entered Madrid in 1710 after victories at Almenar and Saragossa but lack of supplies forced him to retreat; 3,500 British troops surrendered at Brihuega on 8 December and while Villaviciosa on 10 December was a tactical draw, it confirmed Bourbon control of Spain. British financial power was essential for the Allies to continue but the pro-peace Tories won a landslide victory in the 1710 British election.\n\nNegotiations resumed in March 1710 at Geertruidenberg but broke down due to the continued insistence France expel Philip by force if he refused to abdicate. The new British government confirmed its commitment to the war to prevent a credit crisis and reassure its Allies; despite the capture of Bouchain in September, decisive victory in Northern France continued to elude the Allies while an expedition against Quebec in French North America ended in disaster.\n\nThe British political situation was simplified when Emperor Joseph died in April 1711 and Archduke Charles elected Emperor in October. The purpose of continuing the war was unclear, since union of Spain with Austria was as unwelcome as one with France and as the Tory propagandist Jonathan Swift pointed out, the 1701 Treaty made no reference to removing Philip. Even the Whigs had grown frustrated by the Habsburg tendency to put their interests first e.g. the 1707 Convention of Milan or the diversion of resources to capturing Naples in 1707.\n\nThe British secretly negotiated peace terms directly with France leading to the signing of the Preliminary Articles of London on 8 October 1711. These included French acceptance of the Act of Settlement and a guarantee the French and Spanish crowns would remain separate, while France undertook to ensure Spain ceded Gibraltar and Menorca and award the Asiento to Britain for 30 years. Together with a commitment to the Dutch Barrier, these would form the basis of the Treaty of Utrecht.\n\nDespite their annoyance at being excluded from the Anglo-French negotiations, the Dutch were financially exhausted by the enormous cost of the war and could not continue without British support. Charles VI rejected the idea of a peace conference; once the Dutch agreed to support it, he reluctantly agreed rather than be isolated but Habsburg opposition to the Treaty continued.\n\nWithin weeks of the conference opening, events threatened the basis of the peace agreed between Britain and France. First, the French presented proposals awarding the Spanish Netherlands to Max Emmanuel of Bavaria and a minimal Barrier, leaving the Dutch with little to show for their huge investment of money and men. Second, a series of deaths left Louis XIV's two year old great-grandson, the future Louis XV as heir, making Philip next in line and his immediate renunciation imperative.\n\nThe Dutch and Austrians fought on, hoping to improve their negotiating position but the British government issued 'Restraining Orders' to Marlborough's replacement, the Duke of Ormonde, instructing him not to participate in offensive operations against the French. These caused fury then and later with prominent Whigs urging the Hanoverian envoy in London to support military intervention by the future George I.\n\nPrince Eugene captured Le Quesnoy in June and besieged Landrecies but was defeated at Denain on 24 July; the French went on to recapture Le Quesnoy and many towns lost in previous years, including Marchines, Douai and Bouchain. The Dutch finally reached the end of their willingness and ability to continue the war.\nOn 6 June, Philip had announced his renunciation of the French throne; the British Tory government now offered the Dutch a revised Barrier Treaty, replacing that of 1709 which they rejected as overly generous. It was a significant improvement on the 1697 Barrier but ultimately subject to Austrian approval and the final terms were less beneficial.\nCharles withdrew from the Conference when France insisted on a guarantee that Austria would not seek to acquire Mantua or Mirandola; he was supported by George, Elector of Hanover, who wanted France to withdraw their support for the Stuart heir James Francis. This meant neither Austria or the Empire signed the Treaty of Utrecht of 11 April 1713 between France and the other Allies; Spain made peace with the Dutch in June, then Savoy and Britain on 13 July 1713.\n\nFighting continued on the Rhine but Austria was financially exhausted and after the loss of Landau and Freiburg in November 1713, Charles came to terms. The Treaty of Rastatt on 7 March 1714 confirmed Austrian gains in Italy, returned Breisach, Kehl and Freiburg, ended French support for the Hungarian revolt and agreed terms for the Dutch Barrier fortresses. Charles abandoned his claim to Strasbourg and Alsace and agreed to the restoration of the Wittelsbach Electors of Bavaria and Cologne, Max Emmanuel and Joseph Clemens. Article XIX of the treaty transferred sovereignty over the Spanish Netherlands to Austria. On 7 September, the Holy Roman Empire joined the agreement by the Treaty of Baden; although Catalonia and Majorca were not finally subdued by the Bourbons until June 1715, the war was over.\n\nThe Peace of Utrecht stipulated that \"because of the great danger which threatened the liberty and safety of all Europe, from the too close conjunction of the kingdoms of Spain and France, [...] one and the same person should never become King of both kingdoms.\" Some historians view this as a key point in the evolution of the modern nation state, while legal historian Randall Lesaffer also argues that it marks a significant milestone in the concept of collective security.\n\nBritain is usually seen as the main beneficiary, Utrecht marking its rise to becoming the primary European commercial power. It established naval superiority over its competitors, controlled the strategic Mediterranean ports of Gibraltar and Menorca, and gained commercial access to Spanish America. France accepted the Protestant succession, ensuring a smooth inheritance by George I in August 1714 and ended support for the Stuarts under the 1716 Anglo-French Treaty. Lastly, the war left all the participants with unprecedented levels of government debt but only Britain successfully financed it.\n\nPhilip was confirmed as King of Spain, which retained its independence and the majority of its Empire but ceded the Spanish Netherlands and most of their Italian possessions. The 1707 \"Nueva Planta\" decrees transferred powers to Madrid and largely abolished regional political structures. These reforms enabled Spain to recover remarkably quickly and only British naval power prevented them regaining Naples and Sicily in 1718.\n\nDespite its failure in Spain, Austria secured its position in Italy and Hungary and acquired the bulk of the Spanish Netherlands. Even after reimbursing the Dutch for most of the expenses associated with their Barrier, the increased tax revenues helped fund a significant expansion of Austrian military forces. The acquisition of maritime territories in the Netherlands and Italy increased the potential for conflict in an area where Austria had traditionally relied on others and Spain recaptured Sicily and Naples during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734.\n\nVictory in the Austro-Turkish War of 1716–18 continued the trend of Habsburg focus shifting away from Germany and into South-East Europe. Their hold over the Empire weakened, with Bavaria, Hanover, Prussia and Saxony increasingly acting as independent powers; in 1742, Charles of Bavaria became the first non-Habsburg Emperor in over 300 years.\n\nHistorian Robert A. Kann argues Austria's failure to fully benefit from its investment in the war was due to Charles VI's stubbornness and dynastic pride. Ensuring his daughter's succession in preference to his niece via the 1713 Pragmatic Sanction, drew Austria into peripheral conflicts like the 1733-1735 War of the Polish Succession, where most of the actual fighting took place on Austrian territory.\n\nThe Dutch Republic ended the war effectively bankrupt and the 1715 Barrier Treaty that had cost so much proved largely illusory. The forts were quickly overrun in 1740, Britain's promise of military support against an aggressor proving to be far more effective. The damage suffered by the Dutch merchant navy permanently affected their commercial and political strength and it was superseded by Britain as the pre-eminent European mercantile power.\n\nLouis XIV died on 1 September 1715, with his five-year-old great-grandson reigning as Louis XV until 1774; on his deathbed, he is alleged to have admitted 'I have loved war too well.' True or not, while the final settlement was far more favourable than the Allied offer of 1709, it is hard to see what Louis gained that had not already been achieved through diplomacy by February 1701. France remained strong but could not maintain its former dominance, particularly in relation to Britain; concern over this relative decline in military and economic terms was an underlying cause of the War of the Austrian Succession.\n\nWider implications include the beginning of the rise of Prussia and Savoy while many of the participants were involved in the 1700-1721 the Great Northern War, with Russia becoming a European power for the first time as a result. Finally, while colonial conflicts were relatively minor and largely confined to the North American theatre or the so-called Queen Anne's War, they were to become a key element in future wars.\n\n\n"}

The theatre is constructed within the masonry shell that used to house the gas holder proper. Built in 1883, it was designed by Martin Nyrop, also known for the design of the Copenhagen City Hall.\n\nThe gasworks of Østre Gasværk was opened in 1878 as the city's second gasworks, when the first Vestre Gasværk, a facility located at the site of the current Meatpacking District, no longer could satisfy the rapidly growing demand for gas. The gasometer now housing Østre Gasværk Teater was constructed in 1881-83 as the first of a series of expansions that four-doubled the capacity of the plant in the time up to the turn of the century. In 1970 it was shut down and was for a while used as a storage for decorations for the Royal Theatre, while awaiting demolition.\n\nFrom 1979, the building started a second life as a venue for various plays and performances. The first big own production was William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" directed by Peter Langdal in 1986. From 1992-98 the theatre had big success with musicals, including \"Les Misérables\", \"Miss Saigon\" and \"Atlantis\".\n\nIt has a rotating stage making scene shifts seamless and easy.\n\n\"Østre Gasværk\" is the title of a 1976 song by Gasolin'.\n"}
