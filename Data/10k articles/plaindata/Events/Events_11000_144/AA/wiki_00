Bruce Cameron, Cathryn Michon, Audrey Wells, Maya Forbes and Wally Wolodarsky, based on the 2010 novel of the same name by W. Bruce Cameron. The film stars Britt Robertson, KJ Apa, Juliet Rylance, John Ortiz, Kirby Howell-Baptiste, Peggy Lipton, Dennis Quaid and Josh Gad.\n\nThe film is a co-production between Amblin Entertainment, Reliance Entertainment, Walden Media and Pariah Entertainment Group. It was released by Universal Pictures on January 27, 2017, and grossed over $204 million worldwide.\n\nA week prior to the film's release, a video surfaced on TMZ showing footage taken from the set of the film, which showed a German Shepherd dragged and dipped into rushing water while visibly resisting. After initial backlash, it was determined the video had been deliberately edited to mislead viewers.\n\nA sequel, titled \"A Dog's Journey\", is scheduled for release on May 17, 2019.\n\nIn the 1950s, a feral puppy is born, wondering what life's true purpose is. Two weeks later, he is whisked away to the dog pound and quickly euthanized, wondering if \"fun\" truly is life's purpose.\n\nHis strong spirit is reborn and reincarnated as a newborn Retriever puppy in 1961. He leaves his cage at a puppy mill and is found by two garbage men who plan to sell him. They leave to drink, and the dog is spotted locked inside their pick-up truck by a young boy named Ethan and his mother, who rescue him from heatstroke. After they convince Ethan's father, the dog is allowed to stay and is renamed Bailey.\n\nBailey and Ethan bond quickly, especially over the summer when the family visits Ethan's maternal grandparents' farm, and Bailey now believes Ethan alone is his purpose. Years pass, and after several attempts at advancing in his job fail, Ethan's father has become a deadbeat alcoholic.\n\nOver the summer, Ethan goes to a fair with Bailey and meets Hannah, whom he quickly begins dating. Ethan and Hannah spend their summer happy together though their senior years are upcoming, but they plan to go to the same school; Ethan getting a football scholarship and Hannah following him on an academic one. When he goes home one night, Ethan's father is drunk and shouting at Ethan's mother. He turns on Ethan then and when his mother tries to keep them separated, he shoves her to the ground. Ethan orders his father to leave and never come back.\n\nLater, at a football game watched by scouts, Ethan is offered a full scholarship to Michigan State, but that night a vindictive classmate named Todd throws a lit firecracker into Ethan's house as a prank, which unintentionally results in a house fire. Bailey alerts Ethan, who goes to save his mother. Unable to get out of the door, they head out through his mother's bedroom window upstairs. Ethan first lowers her with her sheets to the neighbors below, then saves Bailey. However, he drops his rope and must jump, badly fracturing his leg and ending his athletic scholarship. Bailey attacks Todd, who is arrested by the police when firecrackers fall out of his pocket. Now, Ethan must go to an agricultural school where he will learn to take over his grandparents' farm. Falling into depression, Ethan breaks off his romance with Hannah before leaving for college, while Bailey stays with Ethan's grandparents. Sometime afterward, an aged Bailey is put to sleep at the veterinarian's office.\n\nBailey reincarnates into another dog life, a female German Shepherd police dog named Ellie, sometime in the late 1970s/early 1980s, while possessing full memories of his past lives. Ellie is partnered with a widowed officer named Carlos from the Chicago Police Department and works hard at \"seeking\" and \"finding\", now seeing the job as life's purpose. The two form a close relationship which ends after Ellie saves a kidnapped girl from drowning and is then fatally shot by the kidnapper.\n\nReborn again in the mid-1980s as a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, he forms a bond with an Atlanta college student named Maya who names him Tino. Maya is lonely, and Tino makes it his purpose to find her some happiness. She starts a relationship with a classmate named Al whom she begins seeing after Tino falls for Al's dog, a black and white Landseer named Roxie. Maya and Al marry and have 3 children. In love with Roxie, Tino is heartbroken when one day she does not return from the vet. As he lies sleeping, Tino thanks Maya for giving him one of his best lives.\n\nTino is again reborn and reincarnated, this time as a St. Bernard-Australian Shepherd mix, only to be taken in by a neglectful urban couple who name him Waffles. Waffles is dumped in an abandoned lot and sets off in search of a new life. He gradually makes his way to the country area where he spent summers as Bailey and joyfully reunites with his old master Ethan, who is now in his 50s, living a lonely life at his grandparents' old farm, which he now owns and runs. Ethan hands him over to the local animal shelter but soon has a change of heart and reclaims him, naming him Buddy. Buddy, sensing that he has finally found the true purpose of life, reunites Ethan with a widowed Hannah, and they get married.\n\nBuddy convinces Ethan that he is his beloved childhood pet by performing some tricks and responding to key phrases that were known only to the two of them many years ago. The dog in voiceover tells the viewer that life is about having fun; saving others; not getting caught in the past or regrets; finding someone to be with; and living for today.\n\nIn 2015, DreamWorks acquired the film rights for Cameron's novel. On May 8, 2015, it was announced Lasse Hallström would direct the film. On August 5, 2015, Britt Robertson and Dennis Quaid joined the cast. On September 18, 2015, Pooch Hall was cast in the film. On October 15, 2015, Bradley Cooper joined the cast to play the dog's inner voice. He was eventually replaced by Josh Gad. Principal photography began on August 17, 2015.\n\nIn December 2015, the film switched from a DreamWorks Pictures release to under the Amblin Entertainment banner as per Amblin Partners' newly enacted branded strategy. The film was released by Universal Pictures on January 27, 2017. Universal also distributed it overseas, except for countries where Mister Smith Entertainment handled international sales.\n\n\"A Dog's Purpose\" has grossed $64.5 million in the United States and Canada and $139.5 million in other territories for a worldwide gross of $204 million, against a production budget of $22 million.\n\nIn North America it was released alongside \"\" and \"Gold\", and was projected to gross $18–22 million from 3,050 theaters in its opening weekend, slightly lower than initial $27 million tracking had the film debuting to before boycotts against the film were called for. It made $466,000 from Thursday night previews and $5.3 million on its first day. It ended up debuting to $18.2 million, finishing second at the box office behind the second weekend of Universal's own \"Split\". The film dropped 40.6% in its second weekend, grossing $10.8 million and finishing third at the box office.\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 34% based on 137 reviews, and an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"A Dog's Purpose\" offers an awkward blend of sugary sentiment and canine suffering that tugs at animal-loving audiences' heartstrings with shameless abandon.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 43 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\n\"A Dog's Purpose\" was released on digital HD on April 18, 2017, and was followed by a release on Blu-ray and DVD on May 2, 2017, from Universal Pictures Home Entertainment. The film topped the home video sales chart for the week ending on May 7, 2017.\n\nOn January 18, 2017, a video surfaced on TMZ showing footage taken from the set of the film, which shows a German Shepherd named Hercules being dragged and dipped into rushing water while visibly resisting. After a cut in the video, the next clip shows the dog being submerged in the water at the other end of the tank while a voice on set can be heard shouting \"CUT IT!\", and various people are then seen rushing towards the dog. The American Humane Association, which ensures that animals are not harmed in entertainment productions, announced that its representative on set had been suspended over the incident, and that the incident was under further investigation. PETA called for a boycott of the film. Actor Josh Gad, who voices the dog in the movie, was not on set during the making of the film, but stated that he was \"shaken and sad to see any animal put in a situation against its will\". Director Lasse Hallström stated on Twitter that he \"did not witness\" the actions in the video, and was \"very disturbed\" by the footage. Due to the release of the video, Universal Pictures cancelled the film's scheduled January 19 Los Angeles premiere.\n\nAmblin Entertainment released a statement in regards to the incident, saying that \"on the day of the shoot, Hercules did not want to perform the stunt portrayed on the tape so the Amblin production team did not proceed with filming that shot\", and that \"Hercules is happy and healthy\". On February 4, 2017, the American Humane Association reported that an independent third-party animal-cruelty expert had concluded that safety measures on the set of the film were in place and the video had been deliberately edited to mislead the public.\n\nOn June 21, 2017, CEO of Amblin Entertainment Michael Wright announced that a sequel was in development. On August 26, 2018, Universal began production on the sequel, which will be directed by Gail Mancuso, and scheduled for release on May 17, 2019. In addition to Quaid and Gad reprising their roles, the cast will also include Marg Helgenberger, Betty Gilpin, Kathryn Prescott and Henry Lau.\n\n\n"}

It is designed and administered by the HLS Board of Student Advisers and has been in existence since 1911.\n\nAs currently structured, the official competition begins in the fall (usually October or November) of students' 2L year with a round-robin qualifying round. Each team at this stage consists of four participants, who each argue twice in teams of two. The four teams with the highest scores advance to the semi-finals in the spring. Each team is then allowed to add two participants, for a total of six people per team; two members of each team present oral argument in this round, typically before a panel of one federal appellate judge, one district judge, and one state court judge. In the competition's final round, held in the fall of the 3L year, the two remaining teams argue a case before a panel that usually consists of one U.S. Supreme Court justice and two judges from the United States courts of appeal. Prizes are awarded for the best brief, best oralist, and best overall team.\n\nThe competition originally was organized around the school's now-defunct law clubs. The competition occurs primarily in students' 2L year because the faculty found that, for students who did not finish at the very top of their first clear class, \"it [was hard] for them to take the same interest in their work, particularly in the work within the law clubs, participation in which depends entirely upon their own volition.\" Thus, to encourage students to continue working hard, the Ames finalists received prizes of $200 for first place and $100 for second place. After several years of a single-elimination tournament, the format changed to a round-robin that more closely resembles the current qualifying round structure.\n\nThe final round competition is one of the most popular events at the Law School each year, especially because a justice from the U.S. Supreme Court usually presides. The Ames Final Round has occasionally been televised on C-SPAN; for instance, the 1995 finals, featuring Justice Stephen Breyer as the presiding judge, is available online here.\n\nMany have found the Ames competition to be a demanding but rewarding experience. Chief Justice Mary Mullarkey of the Colorado Supreme Court, an Ames semi-finalist in her time at Harvard, wrote that \"what was most rewarding was the opportunity to work as a team with other students. We could debate, argue, and challenge each other as we analyzed the case and prepared the briefs. The process was much more satisfying than the routine of classroom lectures and solitary examinations. The Ames competition provided a realistic view of what practicing law could be like.\"\n\nPrevious notable winners include: \n\nRecent winners:\n\nhttp://www3.law.harvard.edu/orgs/bsa/past-winners/\n"}
{"id": "65169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65169", "title": "Antony and Cleopatra", "text": "Antony and Cleopatra\n\nAntony and Cleopatra (First Folio title: The Tragedie of Anthonie, and Cleopatra) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare. The play was performed first circa 1607 at the Blackfriars Theatre or the Globe Theatre by the King's Men.\nIts first appearance in print was in the Folio of 1623.\n\nThe plot is based on Thomas North's translation of Plutarch's \"Lives\" and follows the relationship between Cleopatra and Mark Antony from the time of the Sicilian revolt to Cleopatra's suicide during the Final War of the Roman Republic. The major antagonist is Octavius Caesar, one of Antony's fellow triumvirs of the Second Triumvirate and the first emperor of the Roman Empire. The tragedy is mainly set in Rome and Egypt and is characterized by swift shifts in geographical location and linguistic register as it alternates between sensual, imaginative Alexandria and a more pragmatic, austere Rome.\n\nMany consider Shakespeare's Cleopatra, whom Enobarbus describes as having \"infinite variety\", as one of the most complex and fully developed female characters in the playwright's body of work. She is frequently vain and histrionic enough to provoke an audience almost to scorn; at the same time, Shakespeare invests her and Antony with tragic grandeur. These contradictory features have led to famously divided critical responses. It is difficult to classify \"Antony and Cleopatra\" as belonging to a single genre. It can be described as a history play (though it does not completely adhere to historical accounts), as a tragedy (though not completely in Aristotelian terms), as a comedy, as a romance, and according to some critics, such as McCarter, a problem play. All that can be said with certainty is that it is a Roman play, and perhaps even a sequel to another of Shakespeare's tragedies, \"Julius Caesar\".\n\n\n\"Antony's party\"\n\n\n\"Octavius' party\"\n\n\n\"Sextus' party\"\n\n\n\"Cleopatra's party\"\n\n\n\"Other\"\n\nMark Antony – one of the triumvirs of the Roman Republic, along with Octavius and Lepidus – has neglected his soldierly duties after being beguiled by Egypt's Queen, Cleopatra. He ignores Rome's domestic problems, including the fact that his third wife Fulvia rebelled against Octavius and then died.\n\nOctavius calls Antony back to Rome from Alexandria to help him fight against Sextus Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas, three notorious pirates of the Mediterranean. At Alexandria, Cleopatra begs Antony not to go, and though he repeatedly affirms his deep passionate love for her, he eventually leaves.\n\nThe triumvirs meet in Rome, where Antony and Octavius put to rest, for now, their disagreements. Octavius' general, Agrippa, suggests that Antony should marry Octavius's sister, Octavia, in order to cement the friendly bond between the two men. Antony accepts. Antony's lieutenant Enobarbus, though, knows that Octavia can never satisfy him after Cleopatra. In a famous passage, he describes Cleopatra's charms: \"Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale / Her infinite variety: other women cloy / The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry / Where most she satisfies.\"\n\nA soothsayer warns Antony that he is sure to lose if he ever tries to fight Octavius.\n\nIn Egypt, Cleopatra learns of Antony's marriage to Octavia and takes furious revenge upon the messenger who brings her the news. She grows content only when her courtiers assure her that Octavia is homely: short, low-browed, round-faced and with bad hair.\n\nBefore battle, the triumvirs parley with Sextus Pompey, and offer him a truce. He can retain Sicily and Sardinia, but he must help them \"rid the sea of pirates\" and send them tributes. After some hesitation Sextus agrees. They engage in a drunken celebration on Sextus' galley, though the austere Octavius leaves early and sober from the party. Menas suggests to Sextus that he kill the three triumvirs and make himself ruler of the Roman Republic, but he refuses, finding it dishonourable. After Antony departs Rome for Athens, Octavius and Lepidus break their truce with Sextus and war against him. This is unapproved by Antony, and he is furious.\n\nAntony returns to Alexandria and crowns Cleopatra and himself as rulers of Egypt and the eastern third of the Roman Republic (which was Antony's share as one of the triumvirs). He accuses Octavius of not giving him his fair share of Sextus' lands, and is angry that Lepidus, whom Octavius has imprisoned, is out of the triumvirate. Octavius agrees to the former demand, but otherwise is very displeased with what Antony has done.\n\nAntony prepares to battle Octavius. Enobarbus urges Antony to fight on land, where he has the advantage, instead of by sea, where the navy of Octavius is lighter, more mobile and better manned. Antony refuses, since Octavius has dared him to fight at sea. Cleopatra pledges her fleet to aid Antony. However, during the Battle of Actium off the western coast of Greece, Cleopatra flees with her sixty ships, and Antony follows her, leaving his forces to ruin. Ashamed of what he has done for the love of Cleopatra, Antony reproaches her for making him a coward, but also sets this true and deep love above all else, saying \"Give me a kiss; even this repays me.\"\n\nOctavius sends a messenger to ask Cleopatra to give up Antony and come over to his side. She hesitates, and flirts with the messenger, when Antony walks in and angrily denounces her behavior. He sends the messenger to be whipped. Eventually, he forgives Cleopatra and pledges to fight another battle for her, this time on land.\n\nOn the eve of the battle, Antony's soldiers hear strange portents, which they interpret as the god Hercules abandoning his protection of Antony. Furthermore, Enobarbus, Antony's long-serving lieutenant, deserts him and goes over to Octavius' side. Rather than confiscating Enobarbus' goods, which Enobarbus did not take with him when he fled, Antony orders them to be sent to Enobarbus. Enobarbus is so overwhelmed by Antony's generosity, and so ashamed of his own disloyalty, that he dies from a broken heart.\n\nAntony loses the battle as his troops desert en masse and he denounces Cleopatra: \"This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.\" He resolves to kill her for the treachery. Cleopatra decides that the only way to win back Antony's love is to send him word that she killed herself, dying with his name on her lips. She locks herself in her monument, and awaits Antony's return.\nHer plan backfires: rather than rushing back in remorse to see the \"dead\" Cleopatra, Antony decides that his own life is no longer worth living. He begs one of his aides, Eros, to run him through with a sword, but Eros cannot bear to do it and kills himself. Antony admires Eros' courage and attempts to do the same, but only succeeds in wounding himself. In great pain, he learns that Cleopatra is indeed alive. He is hoisted up to her in her monument and dies in her arms.\n\nOctavius goes to Cleopatra trying to persuade her to surrender. She angrily refuses since she can imagine nothing worse than being led in chains through the streets of Rome, proclaimed a villain for the ages. She imagines that \"the quick comedians / Extemporally will stage us, and present / Our Alexandrian revels: Antony / Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see / Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness / I' th' posture of a whore.\" This speech is full of dramatic irony, because in Shakespeare's time Cleopatra really was played by a \"squeaking boy\" and Shakespeare's play does depict Antony's drunken revels.\n\nCleopatra is betrayed and taken into custody by the Romans. She gives Octavius what she claims is a complete account of her wealth but is betrayed by her treasurer, who claims she is holding treasure back. Octavius reassures her that he is not interested in her wealth, but Dolabella warns her that he intends to parade her at his triumph.\n\nCleopatra kills herself using the venomous bite of an asp, imagining how she will meet Antony again in the afterlife. Her serving maids Iras and Charmian also die, Iras from heartbreak and Charmian from another asp. Octavius discovers the dead bodies and experiences conflicting emotions. Antony's and Cleopatra's deaths leave him free to become the first Roman Emperor, but he also feels some sympathy for them. He orders a public military funeral.\n\nThe principal source for the story is an English translation of Plutarch's \"Life of Mark Antony,\" from the \"Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans Compared Together\". This translation, by Sir Thomas North, was first published in 1579. Many phrases in Shakespeare's play are taken directly from North, including Enobarbus' famous description of Cleopatra and her barge:\n<poem>\nI will tell you.\nThe barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,\nBurn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;\nPurple the sails, and so perfumed that\nThe winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,\nWhich to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made\nThe water which they beat to follow faster,\nAs amorous of their strokes. For her own person,\nIt beggar'd all description: she did lie\nIn her pavilion—cloth-of-gold of tissue—\nO'er-picturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature: on each side her\nStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\nWith divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem\nTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\nAnd what they undid did.\n</poem>\n\nThis may be compared with North's text:\n\nHowever, Shakespeare also adds scenes, including many portraying Cleopatra's domestic life, and the role of Enobarbus is greatly developed. Historical facts are also changed: in Plutarch, Antony's final defeat was many weeks after the Battle of Actium, and Octavia lived with Antony for several years and bore him two children: Antonia Major, paternal grandmother of the Emperor Nero and maternal grandmother of the Empress Valeria Messalina, and Antonia Minor, the sister-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, mother of the Emperor Claudius, and paternal grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger.\n\nMany scholars believe it was written in 1606–07, although some researchers have argued for an earlier dating, around 1603–04. \"Antony and Cleopatra\" was entered in the Stationers' Register (an early form of copyright for printed works) in May 1608, but it does not seem to have been actually printed until the publication of the First Folio in 1623. The Folio is therefore the only authoritative text we have today. Some scholars speculate that it derives from Shakespeare's own draft, or \"foul papers\", since it contains minor errors in speech labels and stage directions that are thought to be characteristic of the author in the process of composition.\n\nModern editions divide the play into a conventional five-act structure but, as in most of his earlier plays, Shakespeare did not create these act divisions. His play is articulated in forty separate \"scenes\", more than he used for any other play. Even the word \"scenes\" may be inappropriate as a description, as the scene changes are often very fluid, almost montage-like. The large number of scenes is necessary because the action frequently switches between Alexandria, Italy, Messina in Sicily, Syria, Athens, and other parts of Egypt and the Roman Republic. The play contains thirty-four speaking characters, fairly typical for a Shakespeare play on such an epic scale.\n\nMany critics have noted the strong influence of Virgil's first-century Roman epic poem, the \"Aeneid\", on Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\". Such influence should be expected, given the prevalence of allusions to Virgil in the Renaissance culture in which Shakespeare was educated. Moreover, as is well-known, the historical Antony and Cleopatra were the prototypes and antitypes for Virgil's Dido and Aeneas: Dido, ruler of the north African city of Carthage, tempts Aeneas, the legendary exemplar of Roman \"pietas\", to forego his task of founding Rome after the fall of Troy. The fictional Aeneas dutifully resists Dido's temptation and abandons her to forge on to Italy, placing political destiny before romantic love, in stark contrast to Antony, who puts passionate love of his own Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, before duty to Rome. Given the well-established traditional connections between the fictional Dido and Aeneas and the historical Antony and Cleopatra, it is no surprise that Shakespeare includes numerous allusions to Virgil's epic in his historical tragedy. As Janet Adelman observes, \"almost all the central elements in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" are to be found in the \"Aeneid\": the opposing values of Rome and a foreign passion; the political necessity of a passionless Roman marriage; the concept of an afterlife in which the passionate lovers meet.\" However, as Heather James argues, Shakespeare's allusions to Virgil's Dido and Aeneas are far from slavish imitations. James emphasizes the various ways in which Shakespeare's play subverts the ideology of the Virgilian tradition; one such instance of this subversion is Cleopatra's dream of Antony in Act 5 (\"I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony\" [5.2.75]). James argues that in her extended description of this dream, Cleopatra \"reconstructs the heroic masculinity of an Antony whose identity has been fragmented and scattered by Roman opinion.\" This politically charged dream vision is just one example of the way that Shakespeare's story destabilises and potentially critiques the Roman ideology inherited from Virgil's epic and embodied in the mythic Roman ancestor Aeneas.\n\nCleopatra, being the complex figure that she is, has faced a variety of interpretations of character throughout history. Perhaps the most famous dichotomy is that of the manipulative seductress versus the skilled leader. Examining the critical history of the character of Cleopatra reveals that intellectuals of the 19th century and the early 20th century viewed her as merely an object of sexuality that could be understood and diminished rather than an imposing force with great poise and capacity for leadership.\n\nThis phenomenon is illustrated by the famous poet T.S. Eliot's take on Cleopatra. He saw her as \"no wielder of power,\" but rather that her \"devouring sexuality...diminishes her power\". His language and writings use images of darkness, desire, beauty, sensuality, and carnality to portray not a strong, powerful woman, but a temptress. Throughout his writing on Antony and Cleopatra, Eliot refers to Cleopatra as material rather than person. He frequently calls her \"thing\". T.S. Eliot conveys the view of early critical history on the character of Cleopatra.\n\nOther scholars also discuss early critics' views of Cleopatra in relation to a serpent signifying \"original sin\". The symbol of the serpent \"functions, at the symbolic level, as a means of her submission, the phallic appropriation of the queen's body (and the land it embodies) by Octavius and the empire\". The serpent, because it represents temptation, sin, and feminine weakness, is used by 19th and early 20th century critics to undermine Cleopatra's political authority and to emphasise the image of Cleopatra as manipulative seductress.\n\nThe postmodern view of Cleopatra is complex. Doris Adler suggests that, in a postmodern philosophical sense, we cannot begin to grasp the character of Cleopatra because, \"In a sense it is a distortion to consider Cleopatra at any moment apart from the entire cultural milieu that creates and consumes Antony and Cleopatra on stage. However the isolation and microscopic examination of a single aspect apart from its host environment is an effort to improve the understanding of the broader context. In similar fashion, the isolation and examination of the stage image of Cleopatra becomes an attempt to improve the understanding of the theatrical power of her infinite variety and the cultural treatment of that power.\" So, as a microcosm, Cleopatra can be understood within a postmodern context, as long as one understands that the purpose for the examination of this microcosm is to further one's own interpretation of the work as a whole. Author L.T. Fitz believes that it is not possible to derive a clear, postmodern view of Cleopatra due to the sexism that all critics bring with them when they review her intricate character. He states specifically, \"Almost all critical approaches to this play have been coloured by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading.\" One seemingly anti-sexist viewpoint comes from Donald C. Freeman's articulations of the meaning and significance of the deaths of both Antony and Cleopatra at the end of the play. Freeman states, \"We understand Antony as a grand failure because the container of his Romanness \"dislimns\": it can no longer outline and define him even to himself. Conversely, we understand Cleopatra at her death as the transcendent queen of \"immortal longings\" because the container of her mortality can no longer restrain her: unlike Antony, she never melts, but sublimates from her very earthly flesh to ethereal fire and air.\"\n\nSome postmodern critics also believe that the view of Cleopatra is constantly shifting and can be interpreted in many new and sometimes exciting ways. Francesca T. Royster suggests that contemporary interpretations of Cleopatra consider her African-American traits: \"Cleopatra has 'soul'—she provides the proof that there is a locatable black aesthetic transcendent of time and place.\"\n\nThese constant shifts in the perception of Cleopatra are well represented in a review of Estelle Parsons' adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\" at the Interart Theatre in New York City. Arthur Holmberg surmises, \"What had at first seemed like a desperate attempt to be chic in a trendy New York manner was, in fact, an ingenious way to characterise the differences between Antony's Rome and Cleopatra's Egypt. Most productions rely on rather predictable contrasts in costuming to imply the rigid discipline of the former and the languid self-indulgence of the latter. By exploiting ethnic differences in speech, gesture, and movement, Parsons rendered the clash between two opposing cultures not only contemporary but also poignant. In this setting, the white Egyptians represented a graceful and ancient aristocracy—well groomed, elegantly poised, and doomed. The Romans, upstarts from the West, lacked finesse and polish. But by sheer brute strength they would hold dominion over principalities and kingdoms.\" This assessment of the changing way in which Cleopatra is represented in modern adaptations of Shakespeare's play is yet another example of how the modern and postmodern view of Cleopatra is constantly evolving.\n\nCleopatra is a difficult character to pin down because there are multiple aspects of her personality that we occasionally get a glimpse of. However, the most dominant parts of her character seem to oscillate between a powerful ruler, a seductress, and a heroine of sorts. Power is one of Cleopatra's most dominant character traits and she uses it as a means of control. This thirst for control manifested itself through Cleopatra's initial seduction of Antony in which she was dressed as Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and made quite a calculated entrance in order to capture his attention. This sexualised act extends itself into Cleopatra's role as a seductress because it was her courage and unapologetic manner that leaves people remembering her as a \"grasping, licentious harlot\". However, despite her \"insatiable sexual passion\" she was still using these relationships as part of a grander political scheme, once again revealing how dominant Cleopatra's desire was for power. Due to Cleopatra's close relationship with power, she seems to take on the role of a heroine because there is something in her passion and intelligence that intrigues others. She was an autonomous and confident ruler, sending a powerful message about the independence and strength of women. Cleopatra had quite a wide influence, and still continues to inspire, making her a heroine to many.\n\nThe relationship between Egypt and Rome in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" is central to understanding the plot, as the dichotomy allows the reader to gain more insight into the characters, their relationships, and the ongoing events that occur throughout the play. Shakespeare emphasises the differences between the two nations with his use of language and literary devices, which also highlight the different characterizations of the two countries by their own inhabitants and visitors. Literary critics have also spent many years developing arguments concerning the \"masculinity\" of Rome and the Romans and the \"femininity\" of Egypt and the Egyptians. In traditional criticism of \"Antony and Cleopatra\", \"Rome has been characterised as a male world, presided over by the austere Caesar, and Egypt as a female domain, embodied by a Cleopatra who is seen to be as abundant, leaky, and changeable as the Nile\". In such a reading, male and female, Rome and Egypt, reason and emotion, and austerity and leisure are treated as mutually exclusive binaries that all interrelate with one another. The straightforwardness of the binary between male Rome and female Egypt has been challenged in later 20th-century criticism of the play: \"In the wake of feminist, poststructuralist, and cultural-materialist critiques of gender essentialism, most modern Shakespeare scholars are inclined to be far more skeptical about claims that Shakespeare possessed a unique insight into a timeless 'femininity'.\" As a result, critics have been much more likely in recent years to describe Cleopatra as a character that confuses or deconstructs gender than as a character that embodies the feminine.\n\nIn \"Antony and Cleopatra\", Shakespeare uses several literary techniques to convey a deeper meaning about the differences between Rome and Egypt. One example of this is his schema of the container as suggested by critic Donald Freeman in his article, \"The rack dislimns.\" In his article, Freeman suggests that the container is representative of the body and the overall theme of the play that \"knowing is seeing.\" In literary terms a schema refers to a plan throughout the work, which means that Shakespeare had a set path for unveiling the meaning of the \"container\" to the audience within the play. An example of the body in reference to the container can be seen in the following passage:\n\n<poem>\nNay, but this dotage of our general's\nO'erflows the measure . . .\nHis captain's heart,\nWhich in the scuffles of great fights hath burst\nThe buckles on his breast, reneges all temper\nAnd is become the bellows and the fan\nTo cool a gypsy's lust. (1.1.1–2, 6–10)\n</poem>\n\nThe lack of tolerance exerted by the hard-edged Roman military code allots to a general's dalliance is metaphorised as a container, a measuring cup that cannot hold the liquid of Antony's grand passion. Later we also see Antony's heart-container swells again because it \"o'erflows the measure.\" For Antony, the container of the Rome-world is confining and a \"measure,\" while the container of the Egypt-world is liberating, an ample domain where he can explore. The contrast between the two is expressed in two of the play's famous speeches:\n\n<poem>\nLet Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch\nOf the ranged empire fall! Here is my space!\nKingdoms are clay!\n</poem>\n\nFor Rome to \"melt is for it to lose its defining shape, the boundary that contains its civic and military codes. This schema is important in understanding Antony's grand failure because the Roman container can no longer outline or define him—even to himself. Conversely we come to understand Cleopatra in that the container of her mortality can no longer restrain her. Unlike Antony whose container melts, she gains a sublimity being released into the air.\n\nIn her article \"Roman World, Egyptian Earth\", critic Mary Thomas Crane introduces another symbol throughout the play: The four elements. In general, characters associated with Egypt perceive their world composed of the Aristotelian elements, which are earth, wind, fire and water. For Aristotle these physical elements were the centre of the universe and appropriately Cleopatra heralds her coming death when she proclaims, \"I am fire and air; my other elements/I give to baser life,\" (5.2.289-90). Romans, on the other hand, seem to have left behind that system, replacing it with a subjectivity separated from and overlooking the natural world and imagining itself as able to control it. These differing systems of thought and perception result in very different versions of nation and empire. Shakespeare's relatively positive representation of Egypt has sometimes been read as nostalgia for an heroic past. Because the Aristotelian elements were a declining theory in Shakespeare's time, it can also be read as nostalgia for a waning theory of the material world, the pre-seventeenth-century cosmos of elements and humours that rendered subject and world deeply interconnected and saturated with meaning. Thus this reflects the difference between the Egyptians who are interconnected with the elemental earth and the Romans in their dominating the hard-surfaced, impervious world.\n\nCritics also suggest that the political attitudes of the main characters are an allegory for the political atmosphere of Shakespeare's time. According to Paul Lawrence Rose in his article \"The Politics of \"Antony and Cleopatra\"\", the views expressed in the play of \"national solidarity, social order and strong rule\" were familiar after the absolute monarchies of Henry VII and Henry VIII and the political disaster involving Mary Queen of Scots. Essentially the political themes throughout the play are reflective of the different models of rule during Shakespeare's time. The political attitudes of Antony, Caesar, and Cleopatra are all basic archetypes for the conflicting sixteenth-century views of kingship. Caesar is representative of the ideal king, who brings about the Pax Romana similar to the political peace established under the Tudors. His cold demeanour is representative of what the sixteenth century thought to be a side-effect of political genius Conversely, Antony's focus is on valour and chivalry, and Antony views the political power of victory as a by-product of both. Cleopatra's power has been described as \"naked, hereditary, and despotic,\" and it is argued that she is reminiscent of Mary Tudor's reign—implying it is not coincidence that she brings about the \"doom of Egypt.\" This is in part due to an emotional comparison in their rule. Cleopatra, who was emotionally invested in Antony, brought about the downfall of Egypt in her commitment to love, whereas Mary Tudor's emotional attachment to Catholicism fates her rule. The political implications within the play reflect on Shakespeare's England in its message that Impact is not a match for Reason.\n\nCritics have often used the opposition between Rome and Egypt in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" to set forth defining characteristics of the various characters. While some characters are distinctly Egyptian, others are distinctly Roman, some are torn between the two, and still others attempt to remain neutral. Critic James Hirsh has stated that, \"as a result, the play dramatises not two but four main figurative locales: Rome as it is perceived from a Roman point of view; Rome as it is perceived from an Egyptian point of view; Egypt as it is perceived form a Roman point of view; and Egypt as it is perceived from an Egyptian point of view.\"\n\nRome from the Roman perspective: According to Hirsh, Rome largely defines itself by its opposition to Egypt. Where Rome is viewed as structured, moral, mature, and essentially masculine, Egypt is the polar opposite; chaotic, immoral, immature, and feminine. In fact, even the distinction between masculine and feminine is a purely Roman idea which the Egyptians largely ignore. The Romans view the \"world\" as nothing more than something for them to conquer and control. They believe they are \"impervious to environmental influence\" and that they are not to be influenced and controlled by the world but vice versa.\n\nRome from the Egyptian perspective: The Egyptians view the Romans as boring, oppressive, strict and lacking in passion and creativity, preferring strict rules and regulations.\n\nEgypt from the Egyptian perspective: The Egyptian World view reflects what Mary Floyd-Wilson has called geo-humoralism, or the belief that climate and other environmental factors shapes racial character. The Egyptians view themselves as deeply entwined with the natural \"earth\". Egypt is not a location for them to rule over, but an inextricable part of them. Cleopatra envisions herself as the embodiment of Egypt because she has been nurtured and moulded by the environment fed by \"the dung, / the beggar's nurse and Caesar's\" (5.2.7–8). They view life as more fluid and less structured allowing for creativity and passionate pursuits.\n\nEgypt from the Roman perspective: The Romans view the Egyptians essentially as improper. Their passion for life is continuously viewed as irresponsible, indulgent, over-sexualised and disorderly. The Romans view Egypt as a distraction that can send even the best men off course. This is demonstrated in the following passage describing Antony.\n\n<poem>\nBoys who, being mature in knowledge,\nPawn their experience to their present pleasure,\nAnd so rebel judgment.\n</poem>\n\nUltimately the dichotomy between Rome and Egypt is used to distinguish two sets of conflicting values between two different locales. Yet, it goes beyond this division to show the conflicting sets of values not only between two cultures but within cultures, even within individuals. As John Gillies has argued \"the 'orientalism' of Cleopatra's court—with its luxury, decadence, splendour, sensuality, appetite, effeminacy and eunuchs—seems a systematic inversion of the legendary Roman values of temperance, manliness, courage\". While some characters fall completely into the category of Roman or Egyptian (Octavius as Roman, Cleopatra Egyptian) others, such as Antony, cannot chose between the two conflicting locales and cultures. Instead he oscillates between the two. In the beginning of the play Cleopatra calls attention to this saying\n\n<poem>\nHe was dispos'd to mirth, but on the sudden\nA Roman thought hath strook him.\n</poem>\n\nThis shows Antony's willingness to embrace the pleasures of Egyptian life, yet his tendency to still be drawn back into Roman thoughts and ideas.\n\nOrientalism plays a very specific, and yet, nuanced role in the story of Antony and Cleopatra. A more specific term comes to mind, from Richmond Barbour, that of proto-orientalism, that is orientalism before the age of imperialism. This puts Antony and Cleopatra in an interesting period of time, one that existed before the West knew much about what would eventually be called the Orient, but still a time where it was known that there were lands beyond Europe. This allowed Shakespeare to use widespread assumptions about the \"exotic\" east with little academic recourse. It could be said that Antony and Cleopatra and their relationship represent the first meeting of the two cultures in a literary sense, and that this relationship would lay the foundation for the idea of Western superiority vs. Eastern inferiority. The case could also be made that at least in a literary sense, the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra was some people's first exposure to an inter-racial relationship, and in a major way. This plays into the idea that Cleopatra has been made out to be an \"other\", with terms used to describe her like \"gypsy\". And it is this otherization that is at the heart of the piece itself, the idea that Antony, a man of Western origin and upbringing has coupled himself with the Eastern women, the stereotypical \"other\".\n\nFeminist criticism of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" has provided a more in-depth reading of the play, has challenged previous norms for criticism, and has opened a larger discussion of the characterization of Egypt and Rome. However, as Gayle Greene so aptly recognises, it must be addressed that \"feminist criticism [of Shakespeare] is nearly as concerned with the biases of Shakespeare's interpretors – critics, directors, editors – as with Shakespeare himself.\"\n\nFeminist scholars, in respect to \"Antony and Cleopatra\", often examine Shakespeare's use of language when describing Rome and Egypt. Through his language, such scholars argue, he tends to characterise Rome as \"masculine\" and Egypt as \"feminine.\" According to Gayle Greene, \"the 'feminine' world of love and personal relationships is secondary to the 'masculine' world of war and politics, [and] has kept us from realizing that Cleopatra is the play's protagonist, and so skewed our perceptions of character, theme, and structure.\" The highlighting of these starkly contrasting qualities of the two backdrops of \"Antony and Cleopatra\", in both Shakespeare's language and the words of critics, brings attention to the characterization of the title characters, since their respective countries are meant to represent and emphasise their attributes.\n\nThe feminine categorization of Egypt, and subsequently Cleopatra, was negatively portrayed throughout early criticism. The story of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" was often summarised as either \"the fall of a great general, betrayed in his dotage by a treacherous strumpet, or else it can be viewed as a celebration of transcendental love.\" In both reduced summaries, Egypt and Cleopatra are presented as either the destruction of Antony's masculinity and greatness or as agents in a love story. Once the Women's Liberation Movement grew between the 1960s and 1980s, however, critics began to take a closer look at both Shakespeare's characterization of Egypt and Cleopatra and the work and opinions of other critics on the same matter.\n\nJonathan Gil Harris claims that the Egypt vs. Rome dichotomy many critics often adopt does not only represent a \"gender polarity\" but also a \"gender hierarchy\". Critical approaches to \"Antony and Cleopatra\" from the beginning of the 20th century mostly adopt a reading that places Rome as higher in the hierarchy than Egypt. Early critics like Georg Brandes presented Egypt as a lesser nation because of its lack of rigidity and structure and presented Cleopatra, negatively, as \"the woman of women, quintessentiated Eve.\" Egypt and Cleopatra are both represented by Brandes as uncontrollable because of their connection with the Nile River and Cleopatra's \"infinite variety\" (2.2.236).\n\nIn more recent years, critics have taken a closer look at previous readings of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" and have found several aspects overlooked. Egypt was previously characterised as the nation of the feminine attributes of lust and desire while Rome was more controlled. However, Harris points out that Caesar and Antony both possess an uncontrollable desire for Egypt and Cleopatra: Caesar's is political while Antony's is personal. Harris further implies that Romans have an uncontrollable lust and desire for \"what they do not or cannot have.\" For example, Antony only desires his wife Fulvia after she is dead:\n\n<poem>\nThere's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:\nWhat our contempt doth often hurl from us,\nWe wish it ours again; the present pleasure,\nBy revolution lowering, does become\nThe opposite of itself: she's good, being gone:\nThe hand could pluck her back that shov'd her on.\n</poem>\n\nIn this way, Harris is suggesting that Rome is no higher on any \"gender hierarchy\" than Egypt.\n\nL. T. Fitz outwardly claims that early criticism of \"Antony and Cleopatra\" is \"colored by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading.\" Fitz argues that previous criticisms place a heavy emphasis on Cleopatra's \"wicked and manipulative\" ways, which are further emphasised by her association with Egypt and her contrast to the \"chaste and submissive\" Roman Octavia. Finally, Fitz emphasises the tendency of early critics to assert that Antony is the sole protagonist of the play. This claim is apparent in Brandes argument: \"when [Antony] perishes, a prey to the voluptuousness of the East, it seems as though Roman greatness and the Roman Republic expires with him.\" Yet Fitz points out that Antony dies in Act IV while Cleopatra (and therefore Egypt) is present throughout Act V until she commits suicide at the end and \"would seem to fulfill at least the formal requirements of the tragic hero.\"\n\nThese criticisms are only a few examples of how the critical views of Egypt's \"femininity\" and Rome's \"masculinity\" have changed over time and how the development of feminist theory has helped in widening the discussion.\n\nRelativity and ambiguity are prominent ideas in the play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature of many of the characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.\n\nA major theme running through the play is opposition. Throughout the play, oppositions between Rome and Egypt, love and lust, and masculinity and femininity are emphasised, subverted, and commented on. One of Shakespeare's most famous speeches, drawn almost verbatim from North's translation of Plutarch's \"Lives\", Enobarbus' description of Cleopatra on her barge, is full of opposites resolved into a single meaning, corresponding with these wider oppositions that characterise the rest of the play:\n\n<poem>The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,\nBurn'd on the water...\n...she did lie\nIn her pavilion—cloth-of-gold of tissue—\nO'er-picturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature: on each side her\nStood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,\nWith divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem\nTo glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,\nAnd what they undid did. (Act 2, Scene 2)</poem>\n\nCleopatra herself sees Antony as both the Gorgon and Mars (Act 2 Scene 5, lines 118-19).\n\nThe play is accurately structured with paradox and ambivalence in order to convey the antitheses that make Shakespeare's work remarkable.\nAmbivalence in this play is the contrasting response of one's own character. It may be perceived as opposition between word and deed but not to be confused with \"duality.\" For example, after Antony abandons his army during the sea battle to follow Cleopatra, he expresses his remorse and pain in his famous speech: \n<poem>\nAll is lost; \nThis foul Egyptian hath betrayed me: \nMy fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder\nThey cast their caps up and carouse together \nLike friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore! 'tis thou \nHast sold me to this novice; and my heart \nMakes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;\nFor when I am revenged upon my charm, \nI have done all. Bid them all fly; begone. [Exit SCARUS] \nO sun, thy uprise shall I see no more: \nFortune and Antony part here; even here\nDo we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts \nThat spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave \nTheir wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets \nOn blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd, \nThat overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:\nO this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,— \nWhose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home; \nWhose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,— \nLike a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose, \nBeguiled me to the very heart of loss.\nWhat, Eros, Eros! [Enter CLEOPATRA] Ah, thou spell! Avaunt! (IV.12.2913–2938)\n</poem>\n\nHowever, he then strangely says to Cleopatra: \"All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss. Even this repays me\"(3.12.69–70). Antony's speech conveys pain and anger, but he acts in opposition to his emotions and words, all for the love of Cleopatra. Literary critic Joyce Carol Oates explains: \"Antony's agony is curiously muted for someone who has achieved and lost so much.\" This irony gap between word and deed of the characters results in a theme of ambivalence. Moreover, due to the flow of constant changing emotions throughout the play: \"the characters do not know each other, nor can we know them, any more clearly than we know ourselves\". However, it is believed by critics that opposition is what makes good fiction. Another example of ambivalence in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" is in the opening act of the play when Cleopatra asks Anthony: \"Tell me how much you love.\" Prominent professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Tzachi Zamir, points out: \"The persistence of doubt is in perpetual tension with the opposing need for certainty\" and he refers to the persistence of doubt that derives from the contradiction of word and deed in the characters.\n\nBetrayal is a recurring theme throughout the play. At one time or another, almost every character betrays their country, ethics, or a companion. However, certain characters waver between betrayal and loyalty. This struggle is most apparent among the actions of Cleopatra, Enobarbus, and most importantly Antony. Antony mends ties with his Roman roots and alliance with Caesar by entering into a marriage with Octavia, however he returns to Cleopatra. Historian Diana E. E. Kleiner points out \"Anthony's perceived betrayal of Rome was greeted with public calls for war with Egypt\". Although he vows to remain loyal in his marriage, his impulses and unfaithfulness with his Roman roots is what ultimately leads to war. It is twice Cleopatra abandons Antony during battle and whether out of fear or political motives, she deceived Antony. When Thidias, Caesar's messenger, tells Cleopatra Caesar will show her mercy if she will relinquish Antony, she is quick to respond:\n\n<poem>\n\"Most kind messenger,\nSay to great Caesar this in deputation:\nI kiss his conqu'ring hand. Tell him I am prompt\nTo lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel.\" (III.13.75–79)\n</poem>\n\nShakespeare critic Sara Deats says Cleopatras betrayal fell \"on the successful fencing with Octavius that leaves her to be \"noble to [herself]\". However, she quickly reconciles with Antony, reaffirming her loyalty towards him and never truly submitting to Caesar. \nEnobarbus, Antony's most devoted friend, betrays Antony when he deserts him in favour for Caesar. He exclaims, \"I fight against thee! / No: I will go seek some ditch wherein to die\" (IV. 6. 38–39). Although he abandoned Antony, critic Kent Cartwright claims Enobarbus' death \"uncovers his greater love\" for him considering it was caused by the guilt of what he had done to his friend thus adding to the confusion of the characters' loyalty and betrayal that previous critics have also discovered. Even though loyalty is central to secure alliances, Shakespeare is making a point with the theme of betrayal by exposing how people in power cannot be trusted, no matter how honest their word may seem. The characters' loyalty and validity of promises are constantly called into question. The perpetual swaying between alliances strengthens the ambiguity and uncertainty amid the characters loyalty and disloyalty.\n\nAs a play concerning the relationship between two empires, the presence of a power dynamic is apparent and becomes a recurring theme. Antony and Cleopatra battle over this dynamic as heads of state, yet the theme of power also resonates in their romantic relationship. The Roman ideal of power lies in a political nature taking a base in economical control. As an imperialist power, Rome takes its power in the ability to change the world. As a Roman man, Antony is expected to fulfill certain qualities pertaining to his Roman masculine power, especially in the war arena and in his duty as a soldier:\n<poem>\nThose his goodly eyes,\nThat o'er the files and musters of the war\nHave glowed like plated mars, now bend, now turn\nThe office and devotion of their view\nUpon a tawny front. His captain's heart,\nWhich in the scuffles of greatness hath burst\nThe buckles on his breast, reneges all tempers,\nAnd is becomes the bellows and the fan\nTo cool a gipsy's lust.\n</poem>\n\nCleopatra's character is slightly unpin-able, as her character identity retains a certain aspect of mystery. She embodies the mystical, exotic, and dangerous nature of Egypt as the \"serpent of old Nile\". Critic Lisa Starks says that \"Cleopatra [comes] to signify the double-image of the \"temptress/goddess\". She is continually described in an unearthly nature which extends to her description as the goddess Venus.\n\n<poem>\n...For her own person,\nIt beggared all description. She did lie\nIn her pavilion—cloth of gold, of tissue—\nO'er-picturing that Venus where we see\nThe fancy outwork nature.\n</poem>\n\nThis mysteriousness attached with the supernatural not only captures the audience and Antony, but also, draws all other characters' focus. As a center of conversation when not present in the scene, Cleopatra is continually a central point, therefore demanding the control of the stage. As an object of sexual desire, she is attached to the Roman need to conquer. Her mix of sexual prowess with the political power is a threat to Roman politics. She retains her heavy involvement in the military aspect of her rule, especially when she asserts herself as \"the president of [her] kingdom will/ Appear there for a man.\" Where the dominating power lies is up for interpretation, yet there are several mentions of the power exchange in their relationship in the text. Antony remarks on Cleopatra's power over him multiple times throughout the play, the most obvious being attached to sexual innuendo: \"You did know / How much you were my conqueror, and that / My sword, made weak by my affection, would / Obey it on all cause.\"\n\nUse of language in power dynamics\n\nManipulation and the quest for power are very prominent themes not only in the play but specifically in the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra. Both utilise language to undermine the power of the other and to heighten their own sense of power.\n\nCleopatra uses language to undermine Antony's assumed authority over her. Cleopatra's \"'Roman' language of command works to undermine Antony's authority.\" By using a Romanesque rhetoric, Cleopatra commands Antony and others in Antony's own style. In their first exchange in Act I, scene 1, Cleopatra says to Antony, \"I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.\" In this case Cleopatra speaks in an authoritative and affirming sense to her lover, which to Shakespeare's audience would be uncharacteristic for a female lover.\n\nAntony's language suggests his struggle for power against Cleopatra's dominion. Antony's \"obsessive language concerned with structure, organization, and maintenance for the self and empire in repeated references to 'measure,' 'property,' and 'rule' express unconscious anxieties about boundary integrity and violation.\" (Hooks 38) Furthermore, Antony struggles with his infatuation with Cleopatra and this paired with Cleopatra's desire for power over him causes his eventual downfall. He states in Act I, scene 2, \"These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,/Or lose myself in dotage.\" Antony feels restrained by \"Egyptian fetters\" indicating that he recognises Cleopatra's control over him. He also mentions losing himself in dotage – \"himself\" referring to Antony as Roman ruler and authority over people including Cleopatra.\n\nCleopatra also succeeds in causing Antony to speak in a more theatrical sense and therefore undermine his own true authority. In Act I, scene 1, Antony not only speaks again of his empire but constructs a theatrical image: \"Let Rome and Tiber melt, and the wide arch/Of the ranged empire fall... The nobleness of life/Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair/And such a twain can do't – in which I bind/On pain of punishment the world to weet/We stand up peerless.\" Cleopatra immediately says, \"Excellent falsehood!\" in an aside, indicating to the audience that she intends for Antony to adopt this rhetoric.\n\nYachnin's article focuses on Cleopatra's usurping of Antony's authority through her own and his language, while Hooks' article gives weight to Antony's attempts to assert his authority through rhetoric. Both articles indicate the lovers' awareness of each other's quests for power. Despite awareness and the political power struggle existent in the play, Antony and Cleopatra both fail to achieve their goals by the play's conclusion.\n\nThe performance of gender\n\n\"Antony and Cleopatra\" is essentially a male-dominated play in which the character of Cleopatra takes significance as one of few female figures and definitely the only strong female character. As Oriana Palusci says in her article \"When Boys or Women Tell Their Dreams: Cleopatra and the Boy Actor\", \"Cleopatra constantly occupies the centre, if not of the stage, certainly of the discourse, often charged with sexual innuendos and disparaging tirades, of the male Roman world\". We see the significance of this figure by the constant mention of her, even when she is not on stage.\n\nWhat is said about Cleopatra is not always what one would normally say about a ruler; the image that is created makes the audience expect \"to see on stage not a noble Sovereign, but a dark, dangerous, evil, sensual and lewd creature who has harnessed the 'captain's heart\". This dangerously beautiful woman is difficult for Shakespeare to create because all characters, male or female, were played by men. Phyllis Rackin points out that one of the most descriptive scenes of Cleopatra is spoken by Enobarbus: \"in his famous set speech, Enobarbus evokes Cleopatra's arrival on the Cynus\". It is an elaborate description that could never possibly be portrayed by a young boy actor. It is in this way that \"before the boy [playing Cleopatra] can evoke Cleopatra's greatness, he must remind us that he cannot truly represent it\". The images of Cleopatra must be described rather than seen on stage. Rackin points out that \"it is a commonplace of the older criticism that Shakespeare had to rely upon his poetry and his audience's imagination to evoke Cleopatra's greatness because he knew the boy actor could not depict it convincingly\".\n\nThe constant comments of the Romans about Cleopatra often undermine her, representing the Roman thought on the foreign and particularly of Egyptians. From the perspective of the reason-driven Romans, Shakespeare's \"Egyptian queen repeatedly violates the rules of decorum\". It is because of this distaste that Cleopatra \"embodies political power, a power which is continuously underscored, denied, nullified by the Roman counterpart\". To many of Antony's crew, his actions appeared extravagant and over the top: \"Antony's devotion is inordinate and therefore irrational\". It is no wonder, then, that she is such a subordinated queen.\n\nAnd yet she is also shown as having real power in the play. When threatened to be made a fool and fully overpowered by Octavius, she takes her own life: \"She is not to be silenced by the new master, she is the one who will silence herself: 'My resolution and my hands I'll trust/ None about Caesar' (IV. 15.51–52)\". From this, connections can be made between power and the performance of the female role as portrayed by Cleopatra.\n\nInterpretations of crossdressing within the play\n\nScholars have speculated that Shakespeare's original intention was to have Antony appear in Cleopatra's clothes and vice versa in the beginning of the play. This possible interpretation seems to perpetuate the connections being made between gender and power. Gordon P. Jones elaborates on the importance of this detail:\n\nSuch a saturnalian exchange of costumes in the opening scene would have opened up a number of important perspectives for the play's original audience. It would immediately have established the sportiveness of the lovers. It would have provided a specific theatrical context for Cleopatra's later reminiscence about another occasion on which she \"put my tires and mantles on him, whilst / I wore his sword Philippan\" (II.v.22–23). It would have prepared the ground for Cleopatra's subsequent insistence on appearing \"for a man\" (III.vii.18) to bear a charge in the war; in doing so, it would also have prepared the audience for Antony's demeaning acquiescence in her usurpation of the male role.\n\nThe evidence that such a costume change was intended includes Enobarbus' false identification of Cleopatra as Antony:\n<poem>\nDOMITIUS ENOBARBUS: Hush! here comes Antony.\nCHARMIAN: Not he; the queen.\n</poem>\n\nEnobarbus could have made this error because he was used to seeing Antony in the queen's garments. It can also be speculated that Philo was referring to Antony cross-dressing in Act 1, scene 1:\n<poem>\nPHILO: Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,\nHe comes too short of that great property\nWhich still should go with Antony.\n</poem>\n\nIn the context of cross-dressing, \"not Antony\" could mean \"when Antony is dressed as Cleopatra.\"\n\nIf Shakespeare had indeed intended for Antony to crossdress, it would have drawn even more similarities between Antony and Hercules, a comparison that many scholars have noted many times before. Hercules (who is said to be an ancestor of Antony) was forced to wear Queen Omphale's clothing while he was her indentured servant. The Omphale myth is an exploration of gender roles in Greek society. Shakespeare might have paid homage to this myth as a way of exploring gender roles in his own.\n\nHowever, it has been noted that, while women dressing as men (i.e., a boy actor acting a female character who dresses as a man) are common in Shakespeare, the reverse (i.e., a male adult actor dressing as a woman) is all but non-existent, leaving aside Antony's debated case.\n\nCritics' interpretations of boys portraying female characters\n\n\"Antony and Cleopatra\" also contains self-references to the crossdressing as it would have been performed historically on the London stage. For instance, in Act Five, Scene Two, Cleopatra exclaims, \"Antony/ Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness/ I'th' posture of a whore\" (ll. 214–217). Many scholars interpret these lines as a metatheatrical reference to Shakespeare's own production, and by doing so comments on his own stage. Shakespeare critics such as Tracey Sedinger interpret this as Shakespeare's critique of the London stage, which, by the perpetuation of boy actors playing the part of the woman, serves to establish the superiority of the male spectator's sexuality. The male-male relationship, some critics have offered, between the male audience and the boy actor performing the female sexuality of the play would have been less threatening than had the part been played by a woman. It is in this manner that the London stage cultivated in its audience a chaste and obedient female subject, while positioning male sexuality as dominant. Shakespeare critics argue that the metatheatrical references in \"Antony and Cleopatra\" seem to critique this trend and the presentation of Cleopatra as a sexually empowered individual supports their argument that Shakespeare seems to be questioning the oppression of female sexuality in London society. The crossdresser, then, is not a visible object but rather a structure \"enacting the failure of a dominant epistemology in which knowledge is equated with visibility\". What is being argued here is that the cross-dressing on the London stage challenges the dominant epistemology of Elizabethan society that associated sight with knowledge. The boy actors portraying female sexuality on the London stage contradicted such a simple ontology.\n\nCritics such as Rackin interpret Shakespeare's metatheatrical references to the crossdressing on stage with less concern for societal elements and more of a focus on the dramatic ramifications. Rackin argues in her article on \"Shakespeare's Boy Cleopatra\" that Shakespeare manipulates the crossdressing to highlight a motif of the play—recklessness—which is discussed in the article as the recurring elements of acting without properly considering the consequences. Rackin cites the same quote, \"Antony/ Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness/ I'th' posture of a whore\" to make the argument that here the audience is reminded of the very same treatment Cleopatra is receiving on Shakespeare's stage (since she is being portrayed by a boy actor) (V.ii.214–217). Shakespeare, utilizing the metatheatrical reference to his own stage, perpetuates his motif of recklessness by purposefully shattering \"the audience's acceptance of the dramatic illusion\".\n\nOther critics argue that the crossdressing as it occurs in the play is less of a mere convention, and more of an embodiment of dominant power structures. Critics such as Charles Forker argue that the boy actors were a result of what \"we may call androgyny\". His article argues that \"women were barred from the stage for their own sexual protection\" and because \"patriarchally acculturated audiences presumably found it intolerable to see English women—those who would represent mothers, wives, and daughters—in sexually compromising situations\". Essentially, the crossdressing occurs as a result of the patriarchally structured society.\n\nThe textual motif of empire within \"Antony and Cleopatra\" has strong gendered and erotic undercurrents. Antony, the Roman soldier characterised by a certain effeminacy, is the main article of conquest, falling first to Cleopatra and then to Caesar (Octavius). Cleopatra's triumph over her lover is attested to by Caesar himself, who gibes that Antony \"is not more manlike/ Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy/ More womanly than he\" (1.4.5–7). That Cleopatra takes on the role of male aggressor in her relationship with Antony should not be surprising; after all, \"a culture attempting to dominate another culture will [often] endow itself with masculine qualities and the culture it seeks to dominate with feminine ones\"—appropriately, the queen's romantic assault is frequently imparted in a political, even militaristic fashion. Antony's subsequent loss of manhood seemingly \"signifies his lost Romanness, and Act 3, Scene 10, is a virtual litany of his lost and feminised self, his \"wounder chance\". Throughout the play, Antony is gradually bereaved of that Roman quality so coveted in his nostalgic interludes—by the centremost scenes, his sword (a plainly phallic image), he tells Cleopatra, has been \"made weak by his affection\" (3.11.67). In Act 4, Scene 14, \"an un-Romaned Antony\" laments, \"O, thy vile lady!/ She has robb'd me of my sword,\" (22–23)—critic Arthur L. Little Jr. writes that here \"he seems to echo closely the victim of raptus, of bride theft, who has lost the sword she wishes to turn against herself. By the time Antony tries to use his sword to kill himself, it amounts to little more than a stage prop\". Antony is reduced to a political object, \"the pawn in a power game between Caesar and Cleopatra\".\n\nHaving failed to perform Roman masculinity and virtue, Antony's only means with which he might \"write himself into Rome's imperial narrative and position himself at the birth of empire\" is to cast himself in the feminine archetype of the sacrificial virgin; \"once [he] understands his failed virtus, his failure to be Aeneas, he then tries to emulate Dido\". \"Antony and Cleopatra\" can be read as a rewrite of Virgil's epic, with the sexual roles reversed and sometimes inverted. James J Greene writes on the subject: \"If one of the seminally powerful myths in the cultural memory of our past is Aeneas' rejection of his African queen in order to go on and found the Roman Empire, than it is surely significant that Shakespeare's ... depicts precisely and quite deliberately the opposite course of action from that celebrated by Virgil. For Antony... turned his back for the sake of his African queen on that same Roman state established by Aeneas\". Antony even attempts to commit suicide for his love, falling short in the end. He is incapable of \"occupying the... politically empowering place\" of the female sacrificial victim. The abundant imagery concerning his person—\"of penetration, wounds, blood, marriage, orgasm, and shame\"—informs the view of some critics that the Roman \"figures Antony's body as queer, that is, as an open male body... [he] not only 'bends' in devotion' but... bends over\". In reciprocal contrast, \"in both Caesar and Cleopatra we see very active wills and energetic pursuit of goals\". While Caesar's empirical objective can be considered strictly political, however, Cleopatra's is explicitly erotic; she conquers carnally—indeed, \"she made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;/ He plough'd her, and she cropp'd\" (2.2.232–233). Her mastery is unparalleled when it comes to the seduction of certain powerful individuals, but popular criticism supports the notion that \"as far as Cleopatra is concerned, the main thrust of the play's action might be described as a machine especially devised to bend her to the Roman will... and no doubt Roman order is sovereign at the end of the play. But instead of driving her down to ignominy, the Roman power forces her upward to nobility\". Caesar says of her final deed, \"Bravest at the last,/ She levelled at our purposes, and, being royal,/ Took her own way\" (5.2.325–327).\n\nArthur L. Little, in agitative fashion, suggests that the desire to overcome the queen has a corporeal connotation: \"If a black—read foreign—man raping a white woman encapsulates an iconographic truth... of the dominant society's sexual, racial, national, and imperial fears, a white man raping a black woman becomes the evidentiary playing out of its self-assured and cool stranglehold over these representative foreign bodies\". Furthermore, he writes, \"Rome shapes its Egyptian imperial struggle most visually around the contours of Cleopatra's sexualised and racialised black body—most explicitly her \"tawny front\", her \"gipsy's lust\", and her licentious climactic genealogy, \"with Phoebus' amorous pinches black\". In a similar vein, essayist David Quint contends that \"with Cleopatra the opposition between East and West is characterised in terms of gender: the otherness of the Easterner becomes the otherness of the opposite sex\". Quint argues that Cleopatra (not Antony) fulfils Virgil's Dido archetype; \"woman is subordinated as is generally the case in \"The Aeneid\", excluded from power and the process of Empire-building: this exclusion is evident in the poem's fiction where Creusa disappears and Dido is abandoned... woman's place or displacement is therefore in the East, and epic features a series of oriental heroines whose seductions are potentially more perilous than Eastern arms\", i.e., Cleopatra.\n\n\"Antony and Cleopatra\" deals ambiguously with the politics of imperialism and colonization. Critics have long been invested in untangling the web of political implications that characterise the play. Interpretations of the work often rely on an understanding of Egypt and Rome as they respectively signify Elizabethan ideals of East and West, contributing to a long-standing conversation about the play's representation of the relationship between imperializing western countries and colonised eastern cultures. Despite Octavius Caesar's concluding victory and the absorption of Egypt into Rome, \"Antony and Cleopatra\" resists clear-cut alignment with Western values. Indeed, Cleopatra's suicide has been interpreted as suggesting an indomitable quality in Egypt, and reaffirming Eastern culture as a timeless contender to the West. However, particularly in earlier criticism, the narrative trajectory of Rome's triumph and Cleopatra's perceived weakness as a ruler have allowed readings that privilege Shakespeare's representation of a Roman worldview. Octavius Caesar is seen as Shakespeare's portrayal of an ideal governor, though perhaps an unfavourable friend or lover, and Rome is emblematic of reason and political excellence. According to this reading, Egypt is viewed as destructive and vulgar; the critic Paul Lawrence Rose writes: \"Shakespeare clearly envisages Egypt as a political hell for the subject, where natural rights count for nothing.\" Through the lens of such a reading, the ascendancy of Rome over Egypt does not speak to the practice of empire-building as much as it suggests the inevitable advantage of reason over sensuality.\n\nMore contemporary scholarship on the play, however, has typically recognised the allure of Egypt for \"Antony and Cleopatra\"s audiences. Egypt's magnetism and seeming cultural primacy over Rome have been explained by efforts to contextualise the political implications of the play within its period of production. The various protagonists' ruling styles have been identified with rulers contemporary to Shakespeare. For example, there appears to be continuity between the character of Cleopatra and the historical figure of Queen Elizabeth I, and the unfavourable light cast on Caesar has been explained as deriving from the claims of various 16th-century historians.\n\nThe more recent influence of New Historicism and post-colonial studies have yielded readings of Shakespeare that typify the play as subversive, or challenging the status quo of Western imperialism. The critic Abigail Scherer's claim that \"Shakespeare's Egypt is a holiday world\" recalls the criticisms of Egypt put forth by earlier scholarship and disputes them. Scherer and critics who recognise the wide appeal of Egypt have connected the spectacle and glory of Cleopatra's greatness with the spectacle and glory of the theatre itself. Plays, as breeding grounds of idleness, were subject to attack by all levels of authority in the 1600s; the play's celebration of pleasure and idleness in a subjugated Egypt makes it plausible to draw parallels between Egypt and the heavily censored theatre culture in England. In the context of England's political atmosphere, Shakespeare's representation of Egypt, as the greater source of poetry and imagination, resists support for 16th century colonial practices. Importantly, King James' sanction of the founding of Jamestown occurred within months of \"Antony and Cleopatra\"s debut on stage. England during the Renaissance found itself in an analogous position to the early Roman Republic. Shakespeare's audience may have made the connection between England's westward expansion and \"Antony and Cleopatra\"s convoluted picture of Roman imperialism. In support of the reading of Shakespeare's play as subversive, it has also been argued that 16th century audiences would have interpreted \"Antony and Cleopatra\"s depiction of different models of government as exposing inherent weaknesses in an absolutist, imperial, and by extension monarchical, political state.\n\nOne of the ways to read the imperialist themes of the play is through a historical, political context with an eye for intertextuality. Many scholars suggest that Shakespeare possessed an extensive knowledge of the story of Antony and Cleopatra through the historian Plutarch, and used Plutarch's account as a blueprint for his own play. A closer look at this intertextual link reveals that Shakespeare used, for instance, Plutarch's assertion that Antony claimed a genealogy that led back to Hercules, and constructed a parallel to Cleopatra by often associating her with Dionysus in his play. The implication of this historical mutability is that Shakespeare is transposing non-Romans upon his Roman characters, and thus his play assumes a political agenda rather than merely committing itself to a historical recreation. Shakespeare deviates from a strictly obedient observation of Plutarch, though, by complicating a simple dominant/dominated dichotomy with formal choices. For instance, the quick exchange of dialogue might suggest a more dynamic political conflict. Furthermore, certain characteristics of the characters, like Antony whose \"legs bestrid the ocean\" (5.2.82) point to constant change and mutability. Plutarch, on the other hand, was given to \"tendencies to stereotype, to polarise, and to exaggerate that are inherent in the propaganda surrounding his subjects.\"\n\nFurthermore, because of the unlikelihood that Shakespeare would have had direct access to the Greek text of Plutarch's \"Parallel Lives\" and probably read it through a French translation from a Latin translation, his play constructs Romans with an anachronistic Christian sensibility that might have been influenced by St. Augustine's \"Confessions\" among others. As Miles writes, the ancient world would not have been aware of interiority and the contingence of salvation upon conscience until Augustine. For the Christian world, salvation relied on and belonged to the individual, while the Roman world viewed salvation as political. So, Shakespeare's characters in \"Antony and Cleopatra\", particularly Cleopatra in her belief that her own suicide is an exercise of agency, exhibit a Christian understanding of salvation.\n\nAnother example of deviance from the source material is how Shakespeare characterises the rule of Antony and Cleopatra. While Plutarch singles out the \"order of exclusive society\" that the lovers surrounded themselves with – a society with a specifically defined and clear understanding of the hierarchies of power as determined by birth and status – Shakespeare's play seems more preoccupied with the power dynamics of pleasure as a main theme throughout the play. Once pleasure has become a dynamic of power, then it permeates society and politics. Pleasure serves as a differentiating factor between Cleopatra and Antony, between Egypt and Rome, and can be read as the fatal flaw of the heroes if \"Antony and Cleopatra\" is a tragedy. For Shakespeare's \"Antony and Cleopatra\", the exclusivity and superiority supplied by pleasure created the disconnect between the ruler and the subjects. Critics suggest that Shakespeare did similar work with these sources in \"Othello\", \"Julius Caesar\", and \"Coriolanus\".\n\n\"Antony and Cleopatra\" was never intended to be a tragedy; instead, Shakespeare gave the illusion of the tragedy as the two protagonists set out to become the heroes of the play and neither succeeded. Antony and Cleopatra are seen to have a passionate love for each other up till their demise as both are seen ending their lives for the other. Although the couple was seen as a pair that could not live without the other, it does not take much to be able to point out that the basis of their relationship lies on manipulation and lust. Enobarbus was able to see this as he never believed their love was true but instead a contradiction. Cleopatra always wanted Antony to be in the palm of her hands, to always be in control of his emotions and would thus manipulate him by dancing whenever he was sad or fake a sickness if he were to be happy. This makes Antony only chase after Cleopatra even more in a never-ending cycle. They both try to be much more than they are and show their enemies and the world that they are invincible. Rather than them sacrificing themselves for the other, the two protagonists set out to become the hero of the play and to show that being the last one standing, no hand will bring them down but their own. They did not die for love but for the fame that would come behind that sacrifice and in the end are seen as being noble and self-sacrificing. It does not end in a tragedy but in a bittersweet and almost happy ending.\n\nBoth of the lovers' fates are interwoven yet they deceive the other in a fight for dominance that Cleopatra wins for a while as the audience and other characters throughout the play know completely what is going on in the play filled with dramatic irony. Enobarbus once again knows of Antony's unrelenting attachment to Cleopatra and Cleopatra's mind games while the audience knows Cleopatra isn't dead as Antony kills himself over her. They both spent their whole lives trying to achieve higher fame than the other and became notorious for their lust. They are their own Gods and live separate from those that they call normal and watch. The play progresses into the protagonists decline in fame, leaving them to pursue a sure way into that immortality they coveted. They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a small price to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.\n\nThe concept of luck, or Fortune, is frequently referenced throughout \"Antony and Cleopatra\", portrayed as an elaborate \"game\" that the characters participate in. An element of Fate lies within the play's concept of Chance, as the subject of Fortune/Chance's favour at any particular moment becomes the most successful character. Shakespeare represents Fortune through elemental and astronomical imagery that recalls the characters' awareness of the \"unreliability of the natural world\". This calls into question the extent to which the characters' actions influence the resulting consequences, and whether the characters are subject to the preferences of Fortune or Chance. Antony eventually realises that he, like other characters, is merely \"Fortune's knave,\" a mere card in the game of Chance rather than a player. This realization suggests that Antony realises that he is powerless in relation to the forces of Chance, or Fortune. The manner in which the characters deal with their luck is of great importance, therefore, as they may destroy their chances of luck by taking advantage of their fortune to excessive lengths without censoring their actions, Antony did. Scholar Marilyn Williamson notes that the characters may spoil their Fortune by, \"riding too high\" on it, as Antony did by ignoring his duties in Rome and spending time in Egypt with Cleopatra. While Fortune does play a large role in the characters' lives, they do have ability to exercise free will, however; as Fortune is not as restrictive as Fate. Antony's actions suggest this, as he is able to use his free will to take advantage of his luck by choosing his own actions. \nLike the natural imagery used to describe Fortune, scholar Michael Lloyd characterises it as an element itself, which causes natural occasional upheaval. This implies that fortune is a force of nature that is greater than mankind, and cannot be manipulated. The 'game of chance' that Fortune puts into play can be related to that of politics, expressing the fact that the characters must play their luck in both fortune and politics to identify a victor. The play culminates, however, in Antony's realization that he is merely a card, not a player in this game.\n\nThe motif of \"card playing\" has a political undertone, as it relates to the nature of political dealings. Caesar and Antony take action against each other as if playing a card game; playing by the rules of Chance, which sways in its preference from time to time. Although Caesar and Antony may play political cards with each other, their successes rely somewhat on Chance, which hints at a certain limit to the control they have over political affairs. Furthermore, the constant references to astronomical bodies and \"sublunar\" imagery connote a Fate-like quality to the character of Fortune, implying a lack of control on behalf of the characters. Although the characters do exercise free will to a certain extent, their success in regard to their actions ultimately depends on the luck that Fortune bestows upon them. The movement of the \"moon\" and the \"tides\" is frequently mentioned throughout the play, such as when Cleopatra states that, upon Antony's death, there is nothing of importance left \"beneath the moon.\" The elemental and astronomical \"sublunar\" imagery frequently referred to throughout the play is thus intertwined with the political manipulation that each character incites, yet the resulting winner of the political \"game\" relies in part on Chance, which has a supreme quality that the characters cannot maintain control over, and therefore must submit to.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50164132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50164132", "title": "Böhmermann affair", "text": "Böhmermann affair\n\nThe Böhmermann affair (also known as Erdogate) was a political affair following an experimental poem on German satirist Jan Böhmermann's satire show \"Neo Magazin Royale\" in late March 2016 that deliberately insulted Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan using profane language.\n\nDays after a music video titled \"Erdowie, Erdowo, Erdoğan\" in another German satire show had infuriated Erdoğan, prompting Ankara to summon the German ambassador, Böhmermann went on to find the line between satire, which is protected by freedom of speech legislation, and \"abusive criticism\" () of a foreign state leader (Lèse-majesté), which still was a punishable offense in Germany at that time. Explicitly acknowledging this experiment to be deliberately offensive and \"forbidden\", Böhmermann went on to present a poem that not only harshly criticized Erdoğan for his human rights record, but was also liberally seasoned with profanity.\n\nAfter the show was aired on German public television channel ZDFneo, the Turkish government released a verbal note demanding that the German government begin criminal prosecution of Böhmermann. German Chancellor Angela Merkel further escalated the situation by apologizing for Böhmermann's \"intentionally hurtful\" poem – later she called this \"a mistake\". On 15 April Merkel announced in a press conference that the German government had approved Böhmermann's criminal prosecution, but would abolish the respective paragraph 103 of the German penal code before 2018. Intense criticism followed the Chancellor's decision, with speculation that she decided to allow the prosecution in order to protect Germany's refugee deal with Turkey. The case was dropped in October 2016.\n\nEarlier in March, the satirical music video \"Erdowie, Erdowo, Erdoğan\" by German satire show \"extra 3\" had infuriated Turkish President Erdoğan, prompting Ankara to summon the German ambassador.\n\nIn his show, Böhmermann announced he would try to illustrate what is the line between legitimate criticism such as the \"extra 3\" video, which is protected by freedom of speech legislation, and \"abusive criticism\" () of a foreign state leader, which at that time in Germany was a punishable offense. Openly acknowledging that his experiment would be deliberately offensive, and standing in front of a Turkish flag and a portrait of Erdoğan, Böhmermann presented an experimental poem that not only harshly criticized Erdoğan for his human rights record, but also contained profanity.\n\nBöhmermann, among other things, called Erdoğan \"the man who beats girls\", and said that he loved to \"fuck goats and suppress minorities, kick Kurds, hit Christians, and watch child pornography.\" Much of the rest of the poem is devoted to associating Erdoğan with various less accepted forms of sexuality. Böhmermann deliberately played with the limits of satire and said several times that this form of abusive criticism was not allowed in Germany.\n\nThis edition of Böhmermann's show \"Neo Magazin Royale\" was aired on 31 March 2016 on public television channel ZDF neo.\n\nThe ZDF channel distanced itself from the poem and deleted it from the program which can be seen in its internet archives \"Mediathek\". Few days later, ZDF director Thomas Bellut announced the support for \"Neo Magazin Royale\" and the presenter. On 16 April, the channel assured the \"full legal protection\" for Böhmermann throughout the judicial procedures.\n\nThe Turkish government released a verbal note in which it demands the criminal prosecution of Böhmermann. According to the law, the government has to approve the demand for criminal prosecution by the foreign government, before criminal proceedings can be started because of §103/104 StGB. In addition, Erdogan himself made a complaint against Böhmermann as a private person because of the alleged insulting. The Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey, Numan Kurtulmuş, called the poem a \"serious crime against humanity\".\n\n20 people lodged a complaint because of his poem named \"\" (abusive criticism). The instituted proceedings by the prosecutor's office for \"insulting of organs and representatives of foreign states\" are based on principle §103 and §104 in the German penal code.\n\nAfter a phone call with the Turkish Prime Minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, Chancellor Angela Merkel criticised the poem as \"intentionally hurtful\" (\"bewusst verletzend\"), and prosecutors in Mainz planned to consult the federal Justice Ministry on whether to launch criminal proceedings.\n\nOn 15 April, Merkel announced in a press conference that the German government approves a criminal prosecution of Böhmermann, though confirming reports of disagreement between a number of her coalition government's ministries and her office. Merkel said, it was \"not the business of the government\" to make a decision in this case, but of the justice. Considering the particular paragraph of the German criminal code \"unnecessary,\" she however announced legal steps would be taken towards scrapping it by 2018. Thomas Oppermann, leader of coalition partner SPD's Bundestag faction, criticised the decision: \"I think this decision is wrong\", he said. In the past days, there had been dissent in this question between the SPD-led Foreign Office and the Bundeskanzleramt. It was also reported that Merkel herself had changed her mind several times.\n\nAll SPD ministers voted against the decision in the federal government. Nevertheless, Merkel's vote for the prosecution of Böhmermann was decisive. The opposition parties in the Bundestag, Alliance '90/The Greens and Die Linke, as well as the FDP party sharply criticised the decision. On 22 April Merkel herself called her criticism of the poem as \"intentionally hurtful\" a \"mistake\" about which she was \"annoyed\", while defending the decision to allow criminal proceedings against Böhmermann.\n\nDuring a Bundestag debate on 12 May 2016, the CDU MP Detlef Seif read the whole poem to demonstrate that it is an insult of the Turkish president, causing the outrage of several other MPs. \"Put yourself in Erdogan's position and think about how you would feel\", Seif added in support of Angela Merkel. Böhmermann reacted with a Twitter post demanding the lifting of immunity of Seif.\n\nOn 10 April the CEO of publishing house Axel Springer SE, Mathias Döpfner, made a plea for \"solidarity with Jan Böhmermann\". He compared Böhmermann's poem to the works of Martin Kippenberger. Also he referred to Michel Houellebecq's \"Submission\" and accused the German government of kowtowing to Turkey. On 9 May it was reported by Deutsche Presseagentur, that Erdoğan had sued also Döpfner. He applied for a preliminary injunction. It was reported that the court did not approve it, but Erdoğans lawyer wanted to turn to the next instance. In addition, Erdoğan had applied for a preliminary injunction against film director Uwe Boll, which was granted. Now Boll isn't allowed to call Erdoğan a \"moronic little wimp\" anymore. Höcker compared the criticism of Erdoğan with a \"mass rape\".\n\nThe \"Washington Post\" editorial board harshly criticized the German government's reaction in a featured commentary titled \"Will Ms. Merkel defend free expression?\" The editors hold both the \"anachronistic law\" and the \"morally dubious\" refugee deal with Turkey, accountable for what they consider Merkel's countenancing Turkish president \"Erdoğan's bullying inside Germany\". They fear Merkel's \"waffling\" would encourage regimes around the world trying to suppress free speech both outside their borders and within.\n\nDouglas Murray of \"The Spectator\" ran a competition for offensive poems about Erdoğan, promising £1,000 as first prize. The winner was Boris Johnson, Conservative MP and former Mayor of London, who is one-eighth Turkish.\n\nFormer Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis wrote on Twitter: \"Europe first lost its soul (agreement with Turkey on refugees), now it is losing its humour. Hands off @janboehm!\" In a satirical letter to president Erdoğan, the mayor of Tübingen, Boris Palmer (Alliance '90/The Greens), assured the president of his \"solidarity\" and demanded the extradition of Böhmermann to Turkey. \"Cut off Böhmermann's testicles, so he never makes fun of presidents with a short dick again\", he wrote. The letter is signed \"most respectfully, Boris Palmer\".\n\nA YouGov poll revealed on 12 April, that a majority of the Germans supported Böhmermann's position. 48 percent of the pollees found the poem appropriate, 29 percent view it as undue. A great majority (66 percent) opposed the deletion of the poem on the ZDF website as well as Merkel's criticism of the poem as \"intentionally hurtful\" (68 percent). Only 15 percent support a criminal investigation, 77 percent objected it. In the meantime, more than 240,000 people signed a petition for Böhmermann at Change.org. A further poll by Infratest dimap for the German ARD broadcaster published on 17 April showed that 65 percent of the Germans considered Merkel's decision to allow criminal proceedings against Böhmermann as \"wrong\", 28 percent supported it. Also Merkel's personal popularity fell, 45 percent were satisfied with her work, while 56 percent were dissatisfied, an all-time low for her in this legislative period.\n\nIn an open letter several artists and actors expressed solidarity with Böhmermann on 13 April. Among them were the actors Matthias Brandt, Katja Riemann, Jan Josef Liefers, Peter Lohmeyer, the TV presenter Klaas Heufer-Umlauf, writer Thea Dorn and pianist Igor Levit. \"Discussions about and criticism of Jan Böhmermann's Erdoğan poem belong in the newspaper arts sections of the country and not in a courtroom in Mainz\", they wrote.\n\nOn 22 April 2016, Bruno Kramm, leader of Berlin's branch of the German Pirate Party, was arrested by the German police for reading the poem written by Jan Boehmermann in front of the Turkish embassy.\n\nA 20 April 2016 \"Dagbladet\" editorial said that \"People in Norway have been appalled that the German chancellor Angela Merkel has brought to life a dormant law to help Turkey's president (...) Therefore we support the initiative from SV-politicians Audun Lysbakken, Bård Vegar Solhjell and Heikki Holmås to remove a similar dormant law from the Norwegian penal code. Next week in parliament the SV-trio will propose a change in the penal code's paragraph 184a\".\n\nThe Netherlands announced to abolish the punishment for \"insulting of foreign heads of state\" as a reaction to the affair.\n\nIn 2016 NRK's website uploaded a video by NRK Satiriks; the video was linked from the website's home page, by the title of the video, \"Erdogan admits to following a goat home: – But nothing happened\".\n\nOn 12 April it was reported that Böhmermann is under police protection, because he was threatened by supporters of Erdoğan. The filming of upcoming editions of \"Neo Magazin Royale\" has been suspended until May 2016 due to \"massive media reporting and the focus on the programme and the presenter\". Böhmermann had also temporarily suspended his radio show \"Sanft & Sorgfältig\" on Sundays and was not present at the Grimme-Preis (Grimme Awards), where he was awarded for his Varoufakis video.\n\nOn 8 April Böhmermann asked Peter Altmaier, Federal Minister of the German Chancellery, for succor. \"I would like to live in a country where the exploration of the limits of satire is allowed, desired and the subject of a civil society debate\", he wrote on Twitter. He wouldn't ask for help, but desired to plead for \"considering my artistic approach and my position, even if it is contentious\", Böhmermann added. Altmaier wrote back, that he wanted to answer, when he was back in Berlin, but didn't respond anymore since then. Furthermore, Böhmermann engaged the well known media lawyer Christian Schertz, who criticized Merkel and the German federal government among others for not respecting the separation of powers in Germany. Böhmermann himself on 16 April announced a 4-week pause of his TV and radio activities, which was confirmed by his channel ZDF.

{"id": "407151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=407151", "title": "Dancesport", "text": "Dancesport\n\nDancesport denotes competitive ballroom dancing, as contrasted to social or exhibition dancing. In the case of wheelchair dancesport, at least one of the dancers is in a wheelchair.\n\nDancesport events are sanctioned and regulated by dancesport organizations at the national and international level, such as the World DanceSport Federation.\n\nThe name was invented to help competitive ballroom dancing gain Olympic recognition. The physical demand of dancesport has been the subject of scientific research.\n\nThe first unofficial world championship took place in 1909, and the first formation team was presented in 1932 by Olive Ripman at the Astoria Ballroom, London. Dancesport was first broadcast on TV in 1960.\n\nThe term \"dancesport\" applies to the International Style, as well as American Style of competitive ballroom. It includes the following categories:\n\nThese categories apply to both individual couples and formation dance.\n\nThe World Dance Council (WDC) is a registered limited company, and the legal successor to the International Council of Ballroom Dancing (ICBD), which was formed in 1950 in Edinburgh. The WDC operates through a general council and two committees:\n\nIn 2007 the WDC Amateur League was created. This organisation runs a number of competitions and has its own world ranking system for amateur dancers.\n\nEach member country in the WDC has its own national organisation, such as the British Dance Council, which acts as a forum for the many interested parties in that country. The national bodies decide on their delegates to the WDC.\n\nThe World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), formerly the International DanceSport Federation (IDSF), is the international governing body of dancesport, as recognised by the \"International Olympic Committee\" (IOC).\n\nFounded in 1957 as the \"International Council of Amateur Dancers\" (ICAD), it took up the name IDSF in 1990. In 2011 it was renamed to WDSF to emphasise the global character of the organization.\n\nIn the past, the focus of the IDSF was on administering amateur dancers and competitions. However, in 2010 the IDSF Professional Division was created (formerly known as the IPDSC), which extended this focus to professional dancesport.\n\nWDSF members are not permitted to dance in competitions unless they are granted by the WDSF, or one of its member federations.\n\nThere are a wide variety of dance competitions. They range from the well known Blackpool Dance Festival, an event open to all, to competitions conducted exclusively for university students, such as those hosted by the Inter Varsity Dance Association in the UK.\n\nAmateur competitions commonly include events that group dancers by age, experience, or both. For example, events might group young dancers by age, such as: juvenile (<12yrs), junior (12-16yrs), and youth (16-19yrs). Events may sometimes cover a wide range of ages, with groupings such as: under 21yrs, adult, senior I (Over 35yrs), senior II (Over 45yrs), senior III (Over 55yrs, and senior IV (Over 65yrs).\n\nCompetitors may also be grouped by experience level, with categories such as Beginner, Novice, Intermediate, Pre-Amateur and Amateur. These generally correspond to the number of the dances to be performed in the competition, with Beginners performing one dance, and those at Amateur level performing five. In some competitions these are categorized into grades from A to E, with \"A\" the equivalent of the Amateur level, and \"E\" corresponding to the \"Beginner\" level.\n\nWDSF governing bodies in different countries have the flexibility to decide on the dance area size for competitions held in the country.\n\nIn December 2011, the WDSF Open and the Australian Nationals were held at the Hisense Arena located within the Olympic park in Melbourne. The floor was at 84 by 37.7 meters which was 7.61 times the size of what WDSF requires.\n\nThe World Dance Council (WDC) rules for international competitions are lengthy and detailed. The music for competitions is kept confidential until the event. The music always follows a strict tempo and, for a couples competition, it will have a duration of no less than 90 seconds, and no more than two minutes.\n\nSome elementary competitions are restricted to \"basic\" steps, but international competitions are open as to choreography, within the limits of the traditional style of the individual dances. Only the Viennese waltz has defined choreography: it is limited to seven well-specified figures. Lifts are not permitted, except for Show Dance titles. The tempo for each dance is defined. In the finals, couples are marked under the skating system and judged by timing, footwork, rise and fall, alignment, direction and floor craft. Competitors must meet World Anti-Doping Agency rules.\n\nAfter a long campaign, the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), formerly IDSF, was recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the sole representative body for dancesport, on September 5, 1997. At that point, many dance organisations changed their titles to incorporate the word \"sport\". This recognition gives the IDSF, potentially, a unique status. The WDSF website shows letters and certificates from the IOC that recognise dancesport as an eligible sport for inclusion pursuant to rule 29 of the Olympic Charter.\nOn its website, the IDSF gives an upbeat appraisal of the chances of dancesport being included in a future summer Olympic Games. However, dancesport has not been included as an official event at the Olympics since its recognition, and there are many who doubt that it ever will. The 2008 Beijing Olympics did not include ballroom dancing and neither did the 2012 London Olympics. However, it was announced in December 2016 that the dancesport discipline of breakdancing would form part of the programme for the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics, with men's, women's and mixed-team events included in a one-on-one battle format.\n\nBallroom dancing is a partnered activity with a male and female counterpart. Over the years, competitive ballroom dancing has evolved so much in its choreography, requiring a higher level of athleticism. Many individuals that spectate or dance socially often underestimate the physical attributes and demands of ballroom dancing. In order to compete at a world level, elite competitive dancers undergo rigorous training to help and enhance their competition performance. These dancers seem to perform at such a high level of energy expenditure that a deeper understanding of these energy demands may help build specific training programs used to sustain a high quality dance performance consistent over a few rounds of a competition.\n\nIn 1988, an Australian study was conducted to determine the heart rate and estimated energy expended during ballroom dancing. Professors Blanksby and Reidy of the Department of Human Movement and Recreation Studies at the University of Western had ten competitive ballroom dance couples simulate a dancesport competition, dancing their competitive routines in either the Latin American or Standard division. After administrating all required laboratory tests (in order to record their height, weight, body fat percentage, fat free mass and the resting/maximal heart rate and VO2 values), the couples danced a five-dance final, given a 15 to 20 second break between each dance. Throughout the final their heart rates were telemetered and recorded. The purpose of this study was to estimate the energy requirements from heart rates acquired during competition simulation and previously recorded measures of VO2 and HR.\n\nThe average heart rate for male dancers in Standard was 170 beats min and 168 beats min in the Latin American. Females elicited 179 beats min and 177 beats min respectively. Astrand and Rodahl (1977) classify any exercise being extremely heavy if it results in a heart rate above 150 beats min. They also classify an exercise as extremely heavy if oxygen consumption is higher than 2.0L min. All but the females in the Standard dance sequence didn’t exceed an oxygen consumption level of 2.0L min. Finally, the energy expenditure for male athletes was estimated to be 54.1 ± 8.1 kJ min for Standard and 54.0± 9.6kJ min in the Latin American dances. For females it was 34.7 ± 3.8 kJ min and 36.1 ± 4.1 kJ min respectively.\n\nTwo other similar experiments were conducted exhibiting very similar results and analyses.<ref name=\"Massidda, M. M., Cugusi L. C., Ibba M. I., Tradori l. t., Calò C, M, December 11, 2011 206&rft_id=info:pmid/22211197&rft.externalDocID=22211197\"></ref> In all three of the experiments, significant differences in the energy expenditure between the male and female athletes were noticed. Generally males had a higher energy expenditure than their female counterparts. This is evident due to the anthropometric differences between the two sexes and the oxygen transport capacity.\n\nComparing the mean gross energy expenditures (in kJ min) between ballroom dancing and other sports, it is evident that competitive dancing is equally as demanding in comparison to other sporting activities such as basketball (35.83 kJ min) or cross-country running (44.37kJ min) (Consolazioetal,1963), and that ballroom dancing requires a cardiovascular system to be able to work at a high energy level in order to match the given physiological strain.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "448616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=448616", "title": "Dogger Bank incident", "text": "Dogger Bank incident\n\nThe Dogger Bank incident (also known as the North Sea Incident, the Russian Outrage or the Incident of Hull) occurred on the night of 21/22 October 1904, when the Baltic Fleet of Imperial Russian Navy mistook a British trawler fleet from Kingston upon Hull in the Dogger Bank area of the North Sea for an Imperial Japanese Navy force and fired on them. Russian warships also fired on each other in the chaos of the melée. Three British fishermen died and a number were wounded. One sailor and a priest aboard a Russian cruiser caught in the crossfire were also killed. The incident almost led to war between Britain and Russia.\n\nThe Russian warships involved in the incident were en route to the Far East, to reinforce the 1st Pacific Squadron stationed at Port Arthur, and later Vladivostok, during the Russo-Japanese War. Because of the fleet's alleged sightings of balloons and four enemy cruisers the day previously, coupled with \"the possibility that the Japanese might surreptitiously have sent ships around the world to attack\" them, the Russian admiral, Zinovy Rozhestvensky, called for increased vigilance, issuing an order that \"no vessel of any sort must be allowed to get in among the fleet\".\nIt was known that enemy intelligence had been heavily active in the region. Torpedo boats, a recent development of the major navies, had the potential to damage and sink large warships, and were very difficult to detect, causing psychological stress on sailors at war.\n\nSimilar accidents and rumours affected the Russian fleet: there was a general fear of attack, with widespread rumours that a fleet of Japanese torpedo boats were stationed off the Danish coast, talk of the Japanese having mined the seas, and alleged sightings of Japanese submarines. Before the Dogger Bank incident, the nervous Russian fleet fired on fishermen carrying consular dispatches from Russia to them, near the Danish coast, without causing any damage due to their poor gunnery.\n\nAfter navigating a non-existent minefield, the Russian fleet sailed into the North Sea. The disaster of 21 October began in the evening, when the captain of the supply ship \"Kamchatka\" (Камчатка), which was last in the Russian line, took a passing Swedish ship for a Japanese torpedo boat and radioed that he was being attacked. Later that night, during fog, the officers on duty sighted the British trawlers, interpreted their signals incorrectly and classified them as Japanese torpedo boats, despite being more than from Japan. The Russian warships illuminated the trawlers with their searchlights and opened fire. The British trawler \"Crane\" was sunk, and its captain and first mate were killed. Four other trawlers were damaged, and six other fishermen were wounded, one of whom died a few months later. As the trawlers had their nets down, they were unable to flee and, in the general chaos, Russian ships shot at each other: the cruisers \"Aurora\" and \"Dmitrii Donskoi\" were taken for Japanese warships and bombarded by seven battleships sailing in formation, damaging both ships and killing a chaplain and at least one sailor and severely wounding another. During the pandemonium, several Russian ships signalled torpedoes had hit them, and on board the battleship \"Borodino\" rumours spread that the ship was being boarded by the Japanese, with some crews donning life vests and lying prone on the deck, and others drawing cutlasses. More serious losses to both sides were only avoided by the extremely low quality of Russian gunnery, with the battleship \"Oryol\" reportedly firing more than 500 shells without hitting anything. After twenty minutes' firing the fishermen saw a blue light signal on one of the warships, the order to cease firing.\n\nThe incident led to a serious diplomatic conflict between Russia and Britain, which was particularly dangerous due to the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. In the aftermath some British newspapers called the Russian fleet 'pirates' and Admiral Rozhestvensky was heavily criticised for not leaving the British sailors lifeboats. The editorial of the morning's \"Times\" was particularly scathing: \nThe Royal Navy prepared for war, with 28 battleships of the Home Fleet being ordered to raise steam and prepare for action, while British cruiser squadrons shadowed the Russian fleet as it made its way through the Bay of Biscay and down the coast of Portugal. Under diplomatic pressure, the Russian government agreed to investigate the incident, and Rozhestvensky was ordered to dock in Vigo, Spain, where he left behind those officers considered responsible (as well as at least one officer who had been critical of him). From Vigo, the main Russian fleet then approached Tangiers, Morocco, and lost contact with the \"Kamchatka\" for several days. The \"Kamchatka\" eventually rejoined the fleet and claimed that she had engaged three Japanese warships and fired over 300 shells: the ships she had actually fired at were a Swedish merchantman, a German trawler, and a French schooner. As the fleet left Tangiers, one ship accidentally severed the city's underwater telegraph cable with her anchor, preventing communications with Europe for four days.\n\nDue to concerns that the draught of the newer battleships (which had proven to be considerably greater than designed) would prevent their passage through the Suez Canal, the fleet separated after leaving Tangiers on November 3, 1904. The newer battleships and a few cruisers proceeded around the Cape of Good Hope under command of Admiral Rozhestvensky while the older battleships and lighter cruisers made their way through the Suez Canal under the command of Admiral von Felkerzam. They planned to rendezvous in Madagascar and both sections of the fleet successfully completed this part of the journey. The fleet then proceeded to the Sea of Japan where it was soundly defeated in the Battle of Tsushima.\n\nOn 25 November 1904, the British and the Russian governments signed a joint agreement in which they agreed to submit the issue to an international commission of inquiry whose proceedings were to be based on the Hague Convention. The International Commission met in Paris from 9 January to 25 February 1905. The report produced by the International Commission concluded that: \"the commissioners declare that their findings, which are therein formulated, are not, in their opinion, of a nature to cast any discredit upon the military qualities or the humanity of Admiral Rojdestvensky, or of the personnel of his squadron\". It also concluded as follows: \"the commissioners take pleasure in recognising, unanimously, that Admiral Rozhestvensky personally did everything he could, from beginning to end of the incident, to prevent trawlers, recognised as such, from being fired upon by the squadron\".\n\nRussia voluntarily paid a compensation of £66,000 to the fishermen. In 1906 the Fisherman's Memorial was unveiled in Hull to commemorate the deaths of the three British sailors. The approx. 18 feet high statue shows the dead fisherman George Henry Smith and carries the following inscription:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1061449", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1061449", "title": "Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II", "text": "Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II\n\nThe evacuation of civilians in Britain during the Second World War was designed to protect people, especially children, from the risks associated with aerial bombing of cities by moving them to areas thought to be less at risk. Operation Pied Piper, which began on 1 September 1939, officially relocated more than 3.5 million people. There were further waves of official evacuation and re-evacuation from the south and east coasts in June 1940, when a seaborne invasion was expected, and from affected cities after the Blitz began in September 1940. There were also official evacuations from the UK to other parts of the British Empire, and many non-official evacuations within and from the UK. Other mass movements of civilians included British citizens arriving from the Channel Islands, and displaced people arriving from continental Europe.\nThe Government Evacuation Scheme was developed during summer 1938 by the Anderson Committee and implemented by the Ministry of Health. The country was divided into zones, classified as either \"evacuation\", \"neutral\", or \"reception\", with priority evacuees being moved from the major urban centres and billeted on the available private housing in more rural areas. Each zone covered roughly a third of the population, although several urban areas later bombed had not been classified for evacuation. In early 1939, the reception areas compiled lists of available housing. Space was found for about 2000 people, and the government also constructed camps which provided a few thousand additional spaces.\n\nIn summer 1939, the government began to publicise its plan through the local authorities. They had overestimated demand: only half of all school-aged children were moved from the urban areas instead of the expected 80%. There was enormous regional variation: as few as 15% of the children were evacuated from some urban areas, while over 60% of children were evacuated from Manchester, Belfast and Liverpool. The refusal of the central government to spend large sums on preparation also reduced the effectiveness of the plan. In the event over 3,000,000 people were evacuated.\n\nAlmost 3.75 million people were displaced, with around a third of the entire population experiencing some effects of the evacuation. In the first three days of official evacuation, 1.5 million people were moved: 827,000 children of school age; 524,000 mothers and young children (under 5); 13,000 pregnant women; 70,000 disabled people and over 103,000 teachers and other 'helpers'. Children were parted from their parents.\n\nGoods as well as people were evacuated; organisations or departments departed the cities. Art treasures were sent to distant storage: The National Gallery collection spent the war at the Manod Quarry near Ffestiniog, North Wales. The Bank of England moved to the small town of Overton, Hampshire and in 1939–40 moved 2,154 tons of gold to the vaults of the Bank of Canada in Ottawa. The BBC moved variety production to Bristol and Bedford and moved senior staff to Wood Norton near Evesham, Worcestershire. Many senior Post Office staff were relocated to Harrogate. Some private companies moved head offices or their most vital records to comparative safety away from major cities.\n\nGovernment functions were also evacuated. Under \"Plan Yellow\", some 23,000 civil servants and their paperwork were dispatched to available hotels in the better coastal resorts and spa towns. Other hotels were requisitioned and emptied for a possible last-ditch \"Black Move\" should London be destroyed or threatened by invasion. Under this plan, the nucleus of government would relocate to the West Midlands—the War Cabinet and ministers would move to Hindlip Hall, Bevere House and Malvern College near Worcester and Parliament to Stratford-upon-Avon. Winston Churchill was to relocate to Spetchley Park whilst King George VI and other members of the royal family would take up residence at Madresfield Court near Malvern.\n\nSome strained areas took the children into local schools by adopting the First World War expedient of \"double shift education\"—taking twice as long but also doubling the number taught. The movement of teachers also meant that almost a million children staying home had no source of education.\n\nIn 1939 the British Government passed the Camps Act 1939 which established the National Camps Corporation as a body to design and build residential camps for young people, which could provide opportunities for outdoor learning and also act as evacuation centres in the event of war. The architect T. S. Tait was responsible for the design of the buildings, which included accommodation for over 200 children and staff, recreational halls, wash blocks and a dining hall/kitchen complex. These camps were replicated in over thirty different rural locations around the country. During the war years, they acted as safe refuges for city children. After the war the ownership of the sites was transferred to the local authorities. Over the years most of these sites have been lost, but the best preserved example today is Sayers Croft at Ewhurst, Surrey. The dining hall and kitchen complex is protected as a Grade II listed building because of the importance of Tait's work, and because of the painted murals depicting the life of the many evacuees. Evacuation Centres were also set up by the Foster Parent Plan (FPP) for Children Affected by War, later renamed Plan international. One evacuated school was sponsored by the FPP in Knutsford, Cheshire, with each child being financially supported by an American citizen. One female pupil was sponsored by Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt.\n\nThe Children's Overseas Reception Board (CORB) approved 24,000 children for evacuation overseas. Between June and September 1940, 1,532 children were evacuated to Canada, mainly through the Pier 21 immigration terminal; 577 to Australia; 353 to South Africa and 202 to New Zealand. The scheme was cancelled after the was torpedoed on 17 September 1940, killing 77 of the 90 CORB children aboard. However, in 1940 and 1941 about 14,000 children were evacuated privately to overseas relatives or foster families, including 6,000 to Canada and 5,000 to the United States.\n\nA second evacuation effort started during and after the fall of France. From 13 to 18 June 1940, around 100,000 children were evacuated (in many cases re-evacuated). Efforts were made to remove the vulnerable from coastal towns in southern and eastern England facing German-controlled areas. By July, over 200,000 children had been moved; some towns in Kent and East Anglia evacuated over 40% of the population. Also, some 30,000 people arrived from continental Europe and from 20 to 24 June 25,000 people arrived from the Channel Islands. As thousands of Guernsey school children arrived in northern England with their teachers, some were allowed to re establish their schools in empty buildings. Guernsey's Forest School reopened in a church hall in Cheadle Hulme, Cheshire where it operated until August 1945.\n\nOne of the speediest moves was accomplished by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway when it transferred its headquarters out of London. The company took over The Grove, on the estate of the Earl of Clarendon in Hertfordshire. This was made ready as offices and a number of huts built in the surrounding park. On 1 September 1939, it was decided to move in and the transfer was completed before war was declared two days later. Within three days some 3,000 of the staff were based at the new headquarters.\n\nMen of German (and later Italian) origin were interned from 12 May 1940. Many interned were refugees from Nazi Germany. By July, almost all of these men under 70 were held in military camps, mainly on the Isle of Man. At first, unnecessary mistreatment was common, but conditions soon improved. For many interned persons, conditions in the camps were not especially unpleasant.\nWhen the Blitz began in September ,1940, there were clear grounds for evacuation. Free travel and billeting allowance were offered to those who made private arrangements. They were also given to children, the elderly, the disabled, pregnant women, the ill and those who had lost their homes (some 250,000 in the first six weeks in London). By the combination of all the state and private efforts, London's population was reduced by almost 25%. As bombing affected more towns, \"assisted private evacuation\" was extended. However, not all evacuated children, mothers and teachers were safe in the areas to which they had been evacuated. Air raids, unexploded bombs, military vehicles and military minefields posed risks to the evacuees wherever they were posted.\nLondon proved resilient to bombing despite the heavy bombardment. The destruction in the smaller towns was more likely to provoke panic and spontaneous evacuations. The number of official evacuees rose to a peak of 1.37 million by February 1941. By September, it stood at just over one million. By the end of 1943, there were just 350,000 people officially billeted. Still, the V-1 flying bomb attacks from June 1944 provoked another significant exodus from London. Up to 1.5 million people left by September — only 20% were \"official\" evacuees.\n\nFrom September 1944, the evacuation process was officially halted and reversed for most areas except for London and the East coast. Returning to London was not officially approved until June 1945. In March 1946, the billeting scheme was ended, with 38,000 people still without homes.\n\nThe movement of urban children of all classes to unfamiliar rural locations, without their parents, had a major impact. The Evacuees Reunion Association was formed with the support of the Imperial War Museum. It provides opportunities for former evacuees to contribute and share evacuation experiences and for researchers to request information such as the long-term effects of evacuation upon children.\n\nThe evacuation spawned a whole literature of children's and young adult fiction. The convenience of the setting for the writer is clear, allowing the child heroes to have adventures in a strange, new world. Some of the authors, like Nina Bawden, had themselves experienced evacuation.\nNovels for adults featuring evacuation and evacuees are:\n\n\nNon-fiction:\n\n\nOther:\n\n\n\n\n"}

Short films of various genres produced by students with an assistance of Laboratory of Electronic and Multimedia Application (LEMMA) are showcased during one festival evening. The festival is held in the building of the Faculty of Informatics and since 2016 also in the University Cinema Scala. Each year 800–1000 visitors attend to see the new student projects. Initially, the festival was supervised by the dean of the Faculty of Informatics, since 2011 by the mayor of Brno as well.\n\nA short films no longer than eight minutes can take part in the festival. The films have to be produced by students of Masaryk University in the last three years. Most of the films are made in the current academic year, in the courses \"Základy filmové řeči\" (Basics of film discourse) and \"Produkce audiovizuálního díla\" (Production of audiovisual artefacts) lectured by Petr Sojka, Robert Král and Radovan Hakl. In these courses students learn basic filmmaking knowledge, starting with ideas and story for the film, creating screenplays, filming, production and postproduction. Students also handle acting, sounds, costumes and makeup by themselves.\n\nEvery year about twenty films are presented. The best of them are awarded in two categories: Professional jury's choice and Visitor's choice awards. The winners are awarded the Filmobolos trophy and win prizes from sponsors of the festival.\n\nThe festival is organized by students themselves. Every year a new motto and visual style is presented in the form of posters, pamphlets and DVDs. Students have to raise money from various sponsors, they handle public relations, create a trailer and propagation materials, and take care of the official website and social media.\n\nOrganization of the first film festival in 2001 was motivated by the faculty's new possibility of digital video processing and students' interest in making their own films.\n\nThe fourth year of festival (2004) was promoted and sponsored for the first time. The beginning of festival was connected with the release of 10th anniversary of Faculty of Informatics DVD.\n\nThe fifth year (2005) was attended by more than 500 visitors.\n\nIn 2006 the festival offered various film genres such as documentary films, sci-fi, thriller and comedy. The absolute winner was \"Relace\" (Broadcast), a film by Stanislav Hrabí.\n\nYear after, in 2007, a film called \"Krajina za duhou\" (The Land Over the Rainbow) by Lukáš Horáček was chosen as the winner of the Visitor's choice award. The Jury chose a romantic film \"Neznámý\" (Stranger) by Martina Mičovičová and Michal Oravec as the best.\n\nIn 2008 the festival took place during Dies Academicus, in the light of Masaryk University's anniversary. Actors from JAMU also took part this year and thus cooperation with other faculties had begun.\n\nThe winner of 9th year was Martin Kacvinský with his film \"Vir CRT-2116 a jeho přemožitel\" (CRT-2116 Virus and His Defeater). In the bonus section, lecturer Robert Král introduced his film \"Doprdelesvěta!\" \n\nIn the 10th year the festival was visited by over 700 people. The first prize was awarded to a comedy by Michaela Miovská and Martin Bakeš named \"Nebylo nebylo – Jak by asi vypadaly pohádky, kdyby zmizeli kladní hrdinové\" (Not Once Upon a Time – How Would It Look Like If There Were No Heroes). The jury chose stop-motion film \"(L)egoist\" by Miroslav Kolárik as their film of choice. \n\nIn 2011 films were presented with English subtitles for the first time. The winners were \"Mrkvička\" (A Carrot) — an animation by Jiří Starý, and a stop-motion film \"Don't Stay Outside\" by Tomáš Kněžek.\n\nMotto of the 12th festival was \"Film máme v krvi\" (Film Is in Our Blood). This year's winner was Radek Gomola with his 90's RPG-stylized stop-motion film \"Epic Quest I\". The jury chose fake Wikipedia documentary \"Lež.org\" (Lie.org) by Radim Urbášek and Tomáš Hůsek as the best one.\n\nThe 13th festival was stylized in the like of Hollywood blockbusters. Black (brown) comedy \"Shit Happened\" by Jan Kutil won the Visitor's choice award. \"Jana,\" a documentary drama based on real events which happened during the Prague Spring, by Zdeňka Sitová was awarded Jury's choice award. \n\n\"...a přece se točí!\" (...and yet it's being shot!) was the motto of the 14th festival held on May 15, 2014 during the 95th anniversary of Masaryk University. This year both awards went to Jan Pater and his comedy \"Výjimka v překladu\" (Exception in the Translation), which made fun of the number of Slovak students in Czech colleges, mainly in Brno. \n\nThe 15th festival was held on May 15, 2015. This year's motto was \"Střih!\" (Cut!) as a homage to all film editors. Modern interpration of a classic Greek myth \"Pygmalion\", a comedy of the same name directed by Tomáš Schmidl, was awarded the Jury's choice award. The visitor's choice award went to \"Shitman: A New Hero Is Born\" — a parody of Hollywood blockbuster trailers, directed by Samuel Briškár. \n\nThe 16th festival was held on May 20, 2015. For the first time ever, the screenings took place at the Faculty of Informatics and simultaneously at the University cinema Scala in Brno. The motto was slightly provocational, asking people whether they would want to experience the films themselves — \"Chceš to taky?\" (Do you want it too?). The visitor's choice award went to \"Vysněná Domácnost\" (Dreamed Household) — a comedy by M. Humaj. The Jury's choice award was given to \"cute_cats.avi\", an experimental piece by J. Szlauer and J. Špiřík.\n\nOn May 17, 2017, the 17th festival - the second one, which was screened at both Faculty of Informatics and University cinema Scala, took place. The number of people attending this year was speculated to be the highest among festivals so far\n, as people came to \"Move the Picture\" (this year's motto). The winner of the visitor's choice award was \"Gin\", a short philosophically-comedic sketch by František Kovařík. The Jury's choice award went to \"Co se dělo ve škole?\" (What happened in school?), a multi-genred sketch directed by Lýdie Palečková.\n\n18th festival took place on 18th May, 2018. Like every year, there were screening of short films from students of Masaryk University as well as graduates. The festival screening took place at two locations simultaneously - at Faculty of Informatics and University cinema Scala. The winner of the visitor's price was Pavel Čadek's \"Nelajkla mi status\" and the Jury's choice award won film \"Šelma\". \n\n"}

The song tells the story of Nelson being booed off the stage at a concert at Madison Square Garden.\n\nOn October 15, 1971, Richard Nader's Rock 'n Roll Revival concert was given at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The playbill included many greats of the early rock era, including Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, and Bobby Rydell.\n\nNelson came on stage dressed in the then-current fashion, wearing bell-bottoms and a purple velvet shirt, with his hair hanging down to his shoulders. He started playing his older songs like \"Hello Mary Lou\", but then he played the Rolling Stones' \"Country Honk\" (a country version of their hit song \"Honky Tonk Women\") and the crowd began to boo. While some reports say that the booing was caused by police action in the back of the audience, Nelson took it personally and left the stage. He watched the rest of the concert backstage and did not reappear on stage for the finale.\n\n\"Garden Party\" tells of various people who were present, frequently in an oblique manner (\"Yoko brought her Walrus\", referring to Yoko Ono and John Lennon), with a chorus:\n\nBut it's all right now, I've learned my lesson well<br>\nYou see, you can't please everyone, so you've got to please yourself\nOne more reference in the lyrics pertains to a particularly mysterious and legendary audience member: \"Mr. Hughes hid in Dylan's shoes, wearing his disguise\". The Mr. Hughes in question was ex-Beatle George Harrison, who was a next-door neighbor and good friend of Nelson's. Harrison used \"Hughes\" as his traveling alias, and \"hid in Dylan's shoes\" most likely refers to an album of Bob Dylan covers that Harrison was planning but never recorded. \"Wearing his disguise\" also suggests that Harrison traveled incognito.\n\nThe phrases \"Out stepped Johnny B. Goode / Playing guitar, like a-ringing a bell\" refer to Chuck Berry and his song, \"Johnny B. Goode\".\n\n\n\"Garden Party\" reached number six on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart in the fall of 1972; it was Nelson's last top 40 hit on the pop charts. The song also topped the \"Billboard\" easy listening chart for two weeks and reached number 44 on Billboard's Country Singles chart.\n\nCountry singer Johnny Lee recorded a cover version of the song in the late 1970s, entitled \"Country Party\", with slightly altered lyrics. Dwight Yoakam has also performed it live in concert. In 2000 Tarsha Vega sampled \"Garden Party\" in her song \"Be Ya Self\" for the soundtrack for The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. \n\nThe UK band, Smokie, recorded a cover of the song.\n\nIn 2009, John Fogerty recorded the song with the Eagles' Don Henley and Timothy B. Schmit, for his \"The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again\" album.\n\nIn 2012, Adam Young of Owl City covered the song and released it to his SoundCloud and personal blog followers. The song was pulled off of SoundCloud in late 2015, but can still be found on YouTube.\n\nOn December 31, 2012, Phish opened their New Year's Eve concert with the song at Madison Square Garden. Phish bassist and singer Mike Gordon, who sang lead on the tune, wore a shirt very reminiscent of the one George Harrison wore on the cover of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\".\n\nGary Pig Gold recorded his own personal take on the song, which reflected an encounter with Rick himself and appeared, in 2013, on Pop Garden Radio's Legacy: A Tribute to Rick Nelson Volume 1 CD.\n\nTesla guitarist Frank Hannon covered the song, assisted by Matthew and Gunnar Nelson, on his 2018 solo album \"From One Place to Another Vol. 1\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is one of the leading contributions to historical analysis of the causes of World War I, and along with this work \"War of Illusions\" \"(Krieg der Illusionen)\" gave rise to the \"Fischer Thesis\" on the causes of the war. The title translates as \"Grab for World Power\". or \"Bid for World Power\". Essentially Fischer attempts to link together a continuum of German belligerence in their \"grab for power\" weaving it all together into a cohesive theme of German \"Weltpolitik\".\n\n\"Griff nach der Weltmacht\" was published in October 1961. It was published in Britain under the title \"Germany's Aims in the First World War\" in 1967, translated by C.A. Macartney with an introduction by James Joll.\nThe book included a memorandum by the then German Chancellor Bethmann-Hollweg dated 9 September 1914 which set out a plan for Germany to dominate Europe.\n\nFischer argued that Germany had a policy of deliberately provoking war during July 1914 and that during the war Germany developed a set of annexationist war aims similar to those of Adolf Hitler during the Second World War. On publication, the book caused controversy in West Germany as it challenged the view that Hitler was an aberration by emphasising the continuity in German foreign policy in 1914 and 1939. The book was also controversial for challenging the established view that Germany did not bear the primary responsibility for outbreak of the war, the so-called \"war guilt lie\". Fischer also claimed that German elites had wanted war since as early as 1902.\n\nThe historian John Moses stated in his 1975 work \"The Politics of Illusion\" that \"No serious German historian today can venture to pit himself against the evidence compiled by the Fischer school.\" Fischer inspired several disciples, including the historian Imanuel Geiss. However, Fischer was ridiculed by conservative German historians who created a backlash against his ideas. The most notable critic was conservative historian and patriot Gerhard Ritter, who is said to have broken down in tears when lecturing on Fischer's line of argument in \"Griff nach der Weltmacht\". Fischer's ideas were welcomed by historians in communist East Germany; Fritz Klein considered Fischer's views to be uncontroversial.\n\nMombauer argues that Fischer's work led to greater discussion of the Holocaust by German history professors. A number of German and British historians find the assertions of Fischer a glaring oversimplification of how the First World War developed, arguing that is decidedly disingenuous given the complexity of the situation as a whole - especially since parts of the evidence for German war aims (i.e. belligerence) from before the Great War were collected amid the fringe writings of Pan-Germans or were parceled together from Kaiser Wilhelm's rantings; none of which constituted official state policy.\n\nStephen A. Schuker, writing in 2015, notes that although Fischer's book aroused great controversy when it was published, \"Fischer's work made its way. Refinements by Immanuel Geiss, John Röhl, Holger Afflerbach, Annika Mombauer, and others have confirmed the essentials\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28052117", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28052117", "title": "Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy", "text": "Guangzhou Television Cantonese controversy\n\nIn July 2010, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Guangzhou Committee, in a written proposal to mayor of Guangzhou Wan Qingliang, suggested increasing Mandarin programming on Guangzhou Television's main and news channels. The proposal sparked widespread controversy, met with fierce criticism in Cantonese-speaking cities including Guangzhou and Hong Kong, which eventually triggered a mass protest in the former city. In a formal response, Guangzhou TV rejected the proposal, citing \"historic causes and present demands\" as reasons for Cantonese-Mandarin bilingualism.\n\nBeijing made Mandarin the nation's sole official language in 1982, leading to bans on other languages at many radio and television stations. This status was confirmed by the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Standard Spoken and Written Chinese Language, which went into effect on January 1, 2001. This law implements the provision in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China that the state promotes nationwide use of the language.\n\nDue to Mandarin's status as the official language, use of the country's other languages in television as well as radio and film is rigorously restricted by the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT). Permission from national or local authorities is required for using a dialect as the primary programming language at radio and television stations.\n\nIn 1988, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, predecessor of the SARFT, approved the use of Cantonese by Guangdong TV in GDTV Pearl River Channel and Guangzhou TV as a countermeasure against the influence of Hong Kong television in the Pearl River Delta region. TVS-* (TVS2 in Guangdong) is another major channel in China offering Cantonese programming and is the only Cantonese channel permitted to be broadcast worldwide via satellite.\n\nDespite having been approved for use in local television, Cantonese still faces restrictions and challenges in other aspects of social activities, which contributes to the decline of the language, particularly in the younger generations.\n\nIn elementary and secondary schools, the medium of instruction is mandated by law to be Mandarin. Use of Mandarin is also ubiquitously promoted in schools. In contrast, few, if any, local schools offer classes on Cantonese, although this is not explicitly forbidden by law.\n\nIn the past few years, there have been a number of newspaper reports about students in Guangzhou being punished for speaking Cantonese in school and even outside the classroom. One elementary school in Yuexiu, Guangzhou reportedly requires students to speak Mandarin not only in classes but also during their spare time, and threatens to deduct points from their records if they fail to comply. This has caused some children to become reluctant to learn and use Cantonese or unable to understand or communicate in Cantonese at times.\n\nAlso contributing to the decline is the influx of migrant population into Guangzhou as a result of the city's economic and developmental advantages in the country. The migrant worker population in China is estimated to be a huge 250 million, with most of them in big cities like Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. Guangdong is the major destination of migrant workers in China, there is estimated to be over 20 million migrant workers. According to authorities, a big part of the migrant workers in Guangdong province come from Hunan. Increase of non-Cantonese-speaking population in the city leads to an increased number of non-Cantonese-speaking teachers in schools, forcing students to speak Mandarin on more occasions than Cantonese. Non-Cantonese speakers' name-callings online during debates, such as calling Cantonese as language for \"barbarian\", \"uncivilized\", \"uneducated\" people etc., has further deepened the hostility between the two groups.\n\nGuangxi, the neighbor province, used to be a Cantonese-speaking area, especially in the capital Nanning. Since the promotion of Putonghua from the 1990s, the number of Cantonese speakers has been dropped to less than 30% according to an unofficial statistic years later, most of who are the elder generations.\nBesides the decline of Cantonese in Guangzhou, there is also fear of Cantonese declining in Hong Kong. Stephen Matthews, an associate professor of linguistics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong commented that \"It is difficult to calculate the timing but in the medium- to long run, Cantonese is an endangered language\". He added \"It might survive for 50 years or so but after 50 years it may well be on its way out\". Thomas Lee, professor of linguistics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong doesn't believe the situation is as stark, but maintains that Cantonese needs to stay in the mainstream education or it will end up like Shanghainese, now spoken by less than 50% of the Shanghainese people.\nEven as far away as overseas, the Chinatowns have seen Cantonese being pushed out by Mandarin, reflecting different immigration patterns. Peter Kwong, professor of Asian American studies at Hunter College in New York City commented that \"Mandarin's ascent comes with the realignment of power in Chinese-American communities, where the recent (non-Cantonese) immigrants are gaining economic and political clout\".\n\nIn 2009, Guangzhou TV shifted its Financial Channel from Cantonese to Mandarin at a cost of 30 million yuan. Following the transition, viewership of the channel plummeted from 0.34 to 0.09. The main channel's lunchtime news program reverted to Cantonese in January 2010 due to low ratings.\n\nPrior to submission of the proposal to the local government, in June 2010, the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee conducted an online survey on GZTV's broadcasting on its website. In response to a question concerning increasing Mandarin programming, of the 30,000 respondents, among whom two thirds were Guangzhou natives, a dominating 79.5% opposed the increase in favor of maintaining the current Cantonese-to-Mandarin ratio, while only a meager 19.5% were in support.\n\nIn spite of opposition expressed through the survey, in July 2010, the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee officially submitted a proposal titled \"Suggestions on Further Enhancing Construction of Asian Games Soft Environment\" to Guangzhou mayor Wan Qingliang, which explicitly voiced that Guangzhou TV should increase Mandarin programming by either adopting Mandarin as its primary programming language or converting all prime-time programs into using Mandarin and serving reruns in Cantonese.\n\nIn explaining the rationale for the proposal, the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee cited allowing satellite broadcasting of Guangzhou TV programs, an idea supported by 82.1% of the respondents in the online survey, as the main reason. Among municipal television stations of the five Major Cities named by the Chinese Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, Guangzhou TV is the only one whose main channel is not broadcast nationwide via satellite, because the majority of its programs are in Cantonese, while Mandarin programming is one of the requirements of SARFT approval for nationwide broadcasting. The CPPCC Guangzhou Committee also asserted that only if Guangzhou TV achieved nationwide broadcasting would Guangzhou live up to its status as a Chinese Major City, and it would also facilitate more people to know about Guangzhou.\n\nResponses to the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee's proposal were generally negative, especially those from local citizens and netizens; only a minority of reactions were positive. In response to media interviews, local citizens expressed concerns about the possibility of Cantonese being lost, particularly in the younger generations, although there were also more optimistic and neutral opinions.\nNetizens created artworks that satirized the proposal and promoted Cantonese. Some made a sarcastic poster mimicking that of the movie \"Echoes of the Rainbow\". The title of the poster, \"Echoes of the Cantonese\" (, literally \"The Cantonese Stealer\"), has the same pronunciation as that of the movie in both Cantonese and Mandarin. Some others made a poster taking the style of propaganda posters that were popular before the 1990s, with text reading \"Cantonese speak Cantonese, if you can't understand Cantonese, go home\".\n\nOn July 11, 2010, a group of youngsters carried out a flashmob-style gathering in the People's Park in Guangzhou to promote Cantonese, singing famous 1980s Cantopop.\n\nOn July 25, 2010, a crowd of about 10,000 gathered at 5pm in the surroundings of Guangzhou Metro's Jiangnanxi Station in a protest to criticize the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee's proposal and support Cantonese. Organizers of the activity had informed local police in advance, but were forced by the authorities to cancel it. People, however, gathered regardless.\n\nDuring the gathering, the crowd shouted slogans promoting Cantonese, including the battle cry of a famous Cantonese general, Yuan Chonghuan, and mocking at Ji Keguang, who was believed to be the most active supporter in the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee; they also sang \"Glorious Years\" by Beyond. Despite its size, the crowd stayed peaceful and maintained order.\n\nLocal police were dispatched to the scene and exercised restraint throughout, and there was no physical clashes between the protesters and the police. The crowd was dispersed at 6:30pm, when dusk fell and it started to rain.\n\nHan Zhipeng, a member of the CPPCC Guangzhou Committee, expressed his opposition after release of the proposal, saying, \"Cantonese is the carrier of Lingnan culture, and the mother tongue of Guangdong people; it is also a bond connecting overseas Chinese, for most of them speak only Cantonese.\" He further suggested introducing a new Mandarin channel instead of reducing Cantonese programming.\n\nZeng Zhi, director of GZTV's General Editor Office, questioned satellite broadcasting as a motivation for GZTV shifting to Mandarin, saying that nationwide broadcasting was a complicated and difficult issue, and might not be attained even if Cantonese was ditched.\n\nChen Yang, who is celebrated by local television audience for his blunt criticism of government policies and behaviors when hosting \"News Eyes\" for GZTV since the show's inception in February 2004 until being forced to leave in December 2008, sighed, \"Cantonese is in degeneracy... Behind a dialect forced into extinction there must be a weakened culture.\"\n\nZhan Bohui, honorary director of Jinan University's Chinese Dialect Research Centre, defended the proposal, declaring that increasing Mandarin was to cater to the migrant population in Guangzhou, to whom Cantonese was unintelligible.\n\nJi Keguang, the most prominent proponent of the proposal, when requested for comment on the 90% agreement to Cantonese programming in the online survey, responded with \"They need guidance\", which eventually put him at the center of criticism from local citizens and netizens. Ji also downplayed the feasibility of introducing a new Mandarin channel as he believed that a new channel would be very costly and lack time to mature before the 2010 Asian Games.\n\nWang Yang, secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guangdong Committee, noted in a session of the committee on July 16, 2010 that the important upcoming work was \"education, to enlighten and culture the people with education\". The remark was interpreted by the Hong Kong-based \"Apple Daily\" as the authorities maintaining a hard-line stance against popular calls to protect Cantonese.\n\nSu Zhijia, deputy secretary of the CPC Guangzhou Committee, explicitly denied the existence of \"popularizing Putonghua while abolishing Cantonese\" in an interview with Guangzhou TV on July 20, 2010, saying that the government had no intentions to abandon or weaken Cantonese. Meanwhile, he still encouraged local citizens to master Mandarin and use the language on formal occasions and in public places, reflecting the government's policy of promoting it.\n\nIn a formal response, Guangzhou TV rejected the proposal, citing \"historic causes and present demands\" as reasons for Cantonese-Mandarin bilingualism.\n\nGuangzhou city hall deputy Ouyang Yongsheng responded by saying \"Cantonese dialect is Cantonese people's native tongue and is also Lingnan area's dialect. Guangzhou according to law, according to rule, according to heart, according to reason would never do something to 'promote Putonghua while abolishing Cantonese'.\" Other terms which gained popularity among netizens include 'the fall of Cantonese'. A suspect from Hubei was arrested for instigating the event with ulterior motives.\n\nOn 1 August 2010 hundreds of people gathered in People's Park, Guangzhou. About 20 people were taken away by police. Three of them were journalists from Now TV, two from Cable TV and one from Reuters. Others gave the figure at 3000 people attending the Guangzhou rally with 7 journalists arrested. A protester asked a police officer why he was carried away for protecting his own culture as he was not breaking any laws. Another person in the rally said he has never seen that many police in his entire life. About 200 people attended another rally in Hong Kong at the same time in Southorn Playground in Wan Chai.\n\nAt the end of August a 24-year-old female from native Guangzhou was revealed to have started the campaign with her friends on July 11 asking Cantonese speakers to sing Cantonese songs. Government officials called her home and warned her not to take part in any campaign. At the time she believe the campaign should continue.\n\nOn 18 and 19 September 2010, Hong Kong activist Cai Shufang and blogger Zhong Shuangyu led the global Cantonese supporting assembly. However, because of the preparation by the Chinese government, the assembly only been held on time in Hong Kong and United States.\n\nYet in December 2011, the Government of Guangdong promoted a new rule that took effect on 1 March 2012, stating that all government workers, teachers, conference holders and TV/radio host were to use Mandarin rather than dialects such as Cantonese in public appearances, and any Cantonese (or Hakka or Teochew) language TV or radio shows will be broadcast only after permission is granted by the government. This once again brought controversy to Guangzhou Television. However, authorities said this rule still permits usage of Cantonese or other dialects in daily life or public appearances.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6074313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6074313", "title": "Instrument of Jesus' crucifixion", "text": "Instrument of Jesus' crucifixion\n\nThe instrument of Jesus' crucifixion (known in Latin as \"crux\", in Greek as \"stauros\") is generally taken to have been composed of an upright wooden beam to which was added a transom, thus forming a \"cruciform\" or T-shaped structure.\n\nMost Christian denominations present the Christian cross in this form, and the tradition of the T-shape can be traced to early Christianity and the Church fathers. However, some scholars of the late 19th century have maintained that it was in reality a simple stake (\"crux simplex\").\n\nThe Koine Greek terms used in the New Testament of the structure on which Jesus died are \"stauros\" (σταυρός) and \"xylon\" (ξύλον). Those words, which can refer to many different things, do not indicate the precise shape of the structure. Scholars have long known that the Greek word \"stauros\" and the Latin word \"crux\" did not uniquely mean a cross. They have known too that the words had that meaning also, and so have not considered necessarily incorrect the traditional picture of a cross with transom.\n\nThe ambiguity of the terms was noted by Justus Lipsius in his \"De Cruce\" (1594), Jacob Gretser in his \"De Cruce Christi\" (1598) and Thomas Godwyn in his \"Moses and Aaron\" (1662).\n\nJohn Pearson, Bishop of Chester (c. 1660) wrote in his commentary on the Apostles' Creed that the Greek word \"stauros\" originally signified \"a straight standing Stake, Pale, or Palisador\", but that, \"when other transverse or prominent parts were added in a perfect Cross, it retained still the Original Name\", and he declared: \"The Form then of the Cross on which our Saviour suffered was not a simple, but a compounded, Figure, according to the Custom of the \"Romans\", by whose Procurator he was condemned to die. In which there was not only a straight and erected piece of Wood fixed in the Earth, but also a transverse Beam fastned unto that towards the top thereof\".\n\nJustus Lipsius invented a specific terminology to distinguish different forms of what could be called a cross or \"crux\". His basic twofold distinction was between the \"crux simplex\" (a simple stake) and the \"crux compacta\" (a composite of two pieces of wood). The victim could be affixed to the \"crux simplex\" or could be impaled on it. Lipsius then subdivided the \"crux compacta\" into three types: the \"crux decussata\" (X-shaped), \"crux commissa\" (T-shaped) and \"crux immissa\" (†-shaped).\n\nLipsius himself, as also Gretser and Godwyn, held that Jesus was nailed not to a \"crux simplex\", but to a \"crux immissa\". However, W. E. Vine and E. W. Bullinger, as well as Henry Dana Ward, considered that the \"cross\" (Greek \"stauros\", in its original sense literally an upright pale or stake) had no crossbar, and that the traditional picture of Jesus on a cross with a crossbar was incorrect.\n\nIn his 1871 study of the history of the cross, Episcopal preacher Henry Dana Ward accepted as the only form of the gibbet on which Jesus died \"a pale, a strong stake, a wooden post\".\nAnglican theologian E. W. Bullinger, in \"The Companion Bible\" (which was completed and published in 1922, nine years after his 1913 death), was emphatic in his belief that \"stauros\" never meant two pieces of timber placed across one another at any angle, \"but always of one piece alone ... There is nothing [of the word \"stauros\"] in the Greek of the N.T. even to imply two pieces of timber.\" Bullinger wrote that in the catacombs of Rome Christ was never represented there as \"hanging on a cross\" and that the cross was a pagan symbol of life (the ankh) in Egyptian churches that was borrowed by the Christians. He cited a letter from English Dean John William Burgon, who questioned whether a cross occurred on any Christian monument of the first four centuries and wrote: \"The 'invention' of it in pre-Christian times, and the 'invention' of its use in later times, are truths of which we need to be reminded in the present day. The evidence is thus complete, that the Lord was put to death upon an upright stake, and not on two pieces of timber placed in any manner.\"\n\nWith regard to the \"primary\" or \"original\" meaning of the Greek word σταυρός, William Edwy Vine (1873–1949) wrote in his \"Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words\", published in 1940: \"\"stauros\" denotes, primarily, 'an upright pale or stake'. On such malefactors were nailed for execution. Both the noun and the verb stauroo, 'to fasten to a stake or pale', are originally to be distinguished from the ecclesiastical form of a two beamed cross\". He said the shape of the ecclesiastical form of a two-beamed cross \"had its origin in ancient Chaldea, and was used as the symbol of the god Tammuz (being the shape of the mystic Tau, the initial of his name) in Chaldea and nearby lands, including Egypt\". He added that third-century churches, which by then had departed from certain doctrines of the Christian faith, accepted pagans into the faith in order to increase their prestige and allowed them to retain their pagan signs and symbols. \"Hence the Tau or T, in its most frequent form, with the cross-piece lowered, was adopted to stand for the 'cross' of Christ.\" This association of the cross symbol with Tammuz had already been made by Abram Herbert Lewis in his 1892 book \"Paganism Surviving in Christianity\".\n\nAndreas J. Köstenberger (2004) notes that traditional academic reconstruction of the cross has first Jesus, then Simon of Cyrene bear the \"stauros,\" i.e. only the horizontal crossbar, Latin \"patibulum\". Yet when Simon carries the patibulum to Golgotha, the crossbar is then hoisted to the stake to make the traditional crucifix shape. Schröter (1997) notes that the lack of references in ancient sources, aside from Plautus (\"The Charcoal Woman\" 2 and \"The Braggart Warrior\" 2.4.6-7) and Plutarch (\"Moralia\" 554AB), to \"bearing the cross\" implies that a criminal carrying his own patibulum was not very common.\n\nJames B. Torrance in the article \"Cross\" in the \"New Bible Dictionary\" writes that the Greek word for \"cross\" (stauros; verb stauroō; Lat. crux, crucifigo, \"I fasten to a cross\") means primarily an upright stake or beam, but also allows the construction that Jesus and Simon of Cyrene carried a patibulum to Golgotha.\n\nIn applying the word \"stauros\" to the crossbeam, these writers indicate that the complete structure on which Jesus died was not a single upright post but formed what is normally called a cross.\n\nRaymond Edward Brown remarks that in the canonical gospels \"not a word is reported about the form of the cross, about how he was affixed, about the amount of the pain\", but excludes the use for Jesus of a \"crux simplex\", \"since he carried a cross[beam] to the place of execution\".\n\n\"The Greek-English Lexicon\" of Liddell and Scott reports that the meaning of the word \"σταυρός\" in the early Homeric form of Greek, possibly of the eighth to sixth century BC, and also in the writings of the fifth-century BC writers Herodotus and Thucydides and the early-4th century BC Xenophon, is \"an upright pale or stake\" used to build a palisade or \"a pile driven in to serve as a foundation\" It reports that in the writings of the first-century BC Diodorus Siculus, first-century AD Plutarch and early second-century Lucian—as well as in , , —the word \"σταυρός\" is used to refer to a cross, either as the instrument of crucifixion or metaphorically of voluntary suffering; \"its form was indicated by the Greek letter T\". It also reports that Plutarch used the word with regard to a pale for impaling a corpse. Of the writers whom Liddell and Scott gives as using \"σταυρός\" to mean a cross, the \"New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology\" holds that in Diodorus Siculus the word probably means a stake for hanging. Plutarch (in \"An vitiositas ad infelicitatem sufficiat\") distinguishes crucifixion on a \"stauros\" from impalement on a \"skolops.\"\n\nJoel B. Green, in \"The Cambridge Companion to Jesus\", says the evidence of the manner of Jesus' death is far more ambiguous than is generally realised. Literary sensibilities in Roman antiquity did not promote graphic descriptions of the act of crucifixion, and even the Gospels report simply, \"They crucified him,\" adding no further detail. According to Green, the Romans were slaves to no standard technique of crucifixion: \"In describing the siege of Jerusalem by the Roman army, for example, Josephus reports that ‘the soldiers out of rage and hatred amused themselves by nailing their prisoners in different positions’ (J.W. 5.449–51). Elsewhere we learn that victims of crucifixion might be fixed to the stake in order to die, or impaled after death as a public display. They might be fixed to the cross with nails or with ropes. That Jesus was nailed to the cross is intimated in several texts (John 20.25; Acts 2.23; Col 2.14; Gos. Pet. 6.21; Justin Dial. 97). Nor can we turn to archaeological evidence for assistance.\"\n\nProfessor Robin M. Jensen, in her book entitled \"The Cross: History, Art, and Controversy,\" says that ‘\"stauros\" (Latin = \"crux\") did not necessarily imply [a cross]. Historically both Greek and Latin words simply referred to an upright stake to which those condemned to death might be bound or tied until they suffocated to death. The conventional picture of a Latin cross (\"crux immissa\") has been challenged over the centuries as some scholars and even Christian communities have argued instead that Christ died on a T-shaped cross (\"crux comissa\") or even upon a simple stake (\"crux simplex\").’\n\nIn his book \"Crucifixion in Antiquity\", Gunnar Samuelsson declares that, while the New Testament terminology is in itself not conclusive one way or another for the meaning of the word, \"[t]here is a good possibility that σταυρός, when used by the evangelists, already had been charged with a distinct denotation − from Calvary. When, e.g., Mark used the noun it could have meant 'cross' in the sense in which the Church later perceived it. [...] The Gospel accounts probably show that σταυρός \"could\" signify \"cross\" in the mentioned sense, but they do not show that it always did so.\" In his Q and A page he adds: \"(The Gospels) do not describe the event in length [...] The non-detailed accounts of the Gospels do not, however, contradict the traditional understanding. So the traditional understanding of the death of Jesus is correct, but we could acknowledge that it is more based on the eyewitness accounts than the actual passion narratives.\"\n\n\"The New International Dictionary of New Testament Theology\", dealing specifically with the crucifixion of Jesus, says it is most likely that the \"stauros\" had a transverse in the form of a crossbeam. \"Secular sources do not permit any conclusion to be drawn as to the precise form of the cross, as to whether it was the \"crux immissa\" (†) or \"crux commissa\" (T). As it was not very common to affix a \"titlos\" (superscription, loanword from the Lat. \"titulus\"), it does not necessarily follow that the cross had the form of a \"crux immissa\".\"\n\nThe authors say there were two possible ways of erecting the \"stauros\", which would probably have been not much higher than the height of a man. The condemned man could be fastened to the cross lying on the ground at the place of execution, then lifted up on it. Alternatively, it was probably usual to have the stake implanted in the ground before the execution. The victim was tied to the crosspiece and was hoisted up with the horizontal beam and made fast to the vertical stake. They say that as this was the simpler form of erection, and the carrying of the crossbeam (\"patibulum\") was probably a form of punishment for slaves, the \"crux commissa\" may be taken as the normal practice.\nOther reference works contend the cross was \"a post with a cross-beam\" (\"Theological Dictionary of the New Testament\"), \"the form usually seen in pictures, the \"crux immissa\" (Latin cross †), ... in which the upright beam projects above the shorter crosspiece\" (\"International Standard Bible Encyclopedia\"); and \"most likely the \"crux immissa\" (the traditional † depiction) or the \"crux commissa\" (a T-shaped cross)\" (John R. Donahue and Daniel J. Harrington, \"The Gospel of Mark\"). Donahue and Harrington suggest: \"The victim was first affixed to the crossbeam (\"patibulum\") with ropes and/or nails through the wrists or forearms. Then the crossbeam was fitted on the vertical beam and the victim was lifted up and set on a peg or \"seat\" on the vertical beam and perhaps also on a footrest. The idea was to prolong the agony, not to make the victim more comfortable.\"\n\nThe question of the nature of the foundation for the cross used to crucify Jesus, is related to whether Jesus carried only the patibulum or the full cross (patibulum and stipes) to Golgotha - as to whether the upright stipes was a permanent fixture on Golgotha, or whether there was a permanent, or specially prepared reinforced hole for the base of the stipes. This also relates to the height of the cross, where estimates vary from to in height.\n\nSome theories suggest 3 nails were used to fasten victims while others suggest 4 nails. Throughout history, larger numbers of nails have been hypothesized, at times as high as 14 nails. The placing of the nails in the hands, or the wrists is also uncertain. Another theory suggests that the Greek word for hand also includes the forearm and that the nails were placed near the radius and ulna of the forearm. Ropes may have also been used to fasten the hands in addition to the use of nails.\n\nAnother issue has been the use of a \"hypopodium\" as a standing platform to support the feet, given that the hands may not have been able to support the weight. In the 20th century, forensic pathologist Frederick Zugibe performed a number of crucifixion experiments by using ropes to hang human subjects at various angles and hand positions.\n\nIn the Hebrew Bible Deuteronomy 21:23 states that \"cursed of God is everyone who hangs on a tree\". In the Septuagint this became ἐπὶ ξύλου (\"epi xylou\"). The word ξύλον (\"xylon\") can mean anything made of wood, even something as complex as the Trojan horse, and applies also to a tree, even a living one, such as that described in the Book of Revelation 22:2 as the tree of life bearing fruit every month and whose leaves serve for healing. This word is used in the New Testament to refer to that on which Jesus died: Peter's 3 uses of \"xylon\" (in English Bibles \"tree\") compared to Paul who only uses \"xylon\" \"piece of wood\" once.\n\nIn Greek texts the word \"xylon\" could be used for any object made of wood, including in varying contexts, gallows, stocks, pales and stakes. Therefore, the traditional Christian cross with a horizontal crossbeam would also be called \"xylon\". In Liddell and Scott, the meanings of the word \"ξύλον\" are classified under five headings: :I. wood cut and ready for use, firewood, timber (in these senses the word is usually in the plural); :II. piece of wood, log, beam, post or an object made of wood, such as a spoon, the Trojan horse, a cudgel or club, an instrument of punishment (a collar for someone's neck, stocks to confine his feet or to confine his neck, arms and legs, a gallows to hang him, or a stake to impale him), a table, a bench as in the theatre; :III. a tree :IV. a blockhead or a stubborn person; :V. a measure of length.\n\nIn English also, the words \"tree\" and \"timber\" are applied to Christ's cross envisaged as with transom: a hymn sung at the Good Friday veneration of the cross has the refrain: \"Faithful \"Cross\" the Saints rely on, Noble \"tree\" beyond compare! [...] Sweet the \"timber\", sweet the iron, Sweet the burden that they bear!\"\n\nApart from meaning a stake, the word \"stauros\" was also used by writers of the early Christian period to refer to a construction with transom.\n\nUsing the Greek word σταυρός in its verbal form, the Jewish historian Josephus too, writing of the siege of Jerusalem in AD 70, recounted that the Jews caught outside the city walls \"were first whipped, and then tormented with all sorts of tortures, before they died, and were then crucified before the wall of the city … the soldiers, out of the wrath and hatred they bore the Jews, nailed those they caught, \"one after one way, and another after another\", to the crosses, by way of jest.\"\n\nDionysius of Halicarnassus, who lived at the time of the birth of Jesus, described how those condemned to crucifixion were led to the place of execution:\nDionysius here uses the Greek word \"xylon\" (ξύλον) for the horizontal crossbeam (the \"patibulum\") used in Roman crucifixions; he describes how the hands of the condemned man were tied to it (\"χεῖρας ἀποτείναντες ἀμφοτέρας [...] προσδήσαντες\") for him to be whipped while being led to the place of execution.\n\nThe mid-2nd-century diviner Artemidorus spoke of crucifixion as something that occurred on a cross that had breadth as well as height: \"Since he is a criminal, he will be crucified \"in his height and in the extension of his hands\"\" (Oneirocritica 1:76).\n\nLucian of Samosata (121-180) describes the crucifixion of the mythical Prometheus by nailing him to a precipice on the Caucasus \"with his hands outstretched (ἐκπετασθεὶς τὼ χεῖρε) from crag to crag.\"\n\nAlthough there is discussion about the meaning or meanings that the words σταυρός and \"crux\" had at that time, and about the shape or shapes that such gibbets had, Christians of the first centuries are unanimous in describing the particular structure on which Jesus died as having a transom, not as a simple upright.\n\nThe pseudepigraphic Epistle of Barnabas, which scholars suggest may have been before the end of the 1st century, and certainly earlier than 135, whether the writer was an orthodox Christian or not, described the shape people at the time attributed to the device on which Jesus died: the comparisons it draws with Old Testament figures would have had no validity for its readers if they pictured Jesus as dying on a simple stake. Referring to what he saw as Old Testament intimations of Jesus and his cross, he likened the cross to the letter T (the Greek letter tau, which had the numeric value of 300), thus describing it as having a crossbeam. He also wrote, with regard to : \"The Spirit saith to the heart of Moses, that he should \"make a type of the cross and of Him that was to suffer\", that unless, saith He, they shall set their hope on Him, war shall be waged against them for ever. Moses therefore pileth arms one upon another in the midst of the encounter, and standing on higher ground than any \"he stretched out his hands\", and so Israel was again victorious.\"\n\nCelsus (as quoted by Origen Contra Celsum, II:36) and Origen himself uses the verb \"ἀνασκολοπίζω\", which originally meant \"to impale\", of the crucifixion of Jesus. It was considered synonymous with \"σταυρῶ\", which also seems to have originally meant \"to impale\", and was applied also to the gibbet of Jesus' execution; but the shape of the gibbet is compared by Origen to that of the letter Τ. The final words of the \"Trials in the Court of Vowels\",\"Δίκη Φωνηέντων\", 12.4-13 found among the works of Lucian, also identify the shape of the σταυρός with that of the letter Τ. And, as already mentioned, in \" Prometheus on Caucasus\" Lucian describes Prometheus as crucified \"with his hands outstretched\".\n\nThe 2nd-century Odes of Solomon, probably by a heterodox Christian, includes the following: \"I extended my hands and hallowed my Lord, /For the expansion of my hands is His sign. /And my extension is the upright cross (σταυρός).\"\n\nJustin Martyr (100–165) explicitly says the cross of Christ was of two-beam shape: \"That lamb which was commanded to be wholly roasted was a symbol of the suffering of the cross which Christ would undergo. For the lamb, which is roasted, is roasted and dressed up in the form of the cross. For one spit is transfixed right through from the lower parts up to the head, and one across the back, to which are attached the legs of the lamb.\"\n\nLike the Epistle of Barnabas, Justin saw the stretched-out hands of Moses in the battle against Amalek as foreshadowing the cross of Jesus: \"If he gave up any part of this sign, which was an imitation of the cross (σταυρός), the people were beaten, as is recorded in the writings of Moses; but if he remained in this form, Amalek was proportionally defeated, and he who prevailed prevailed by the cross (σταυρός). For it was not because Moses so prayed that the people were stronger, but because, while one who bore the name of Jesus (Joshua) was in the forefront of the battle, he himself made the sign of the cross (σταυρός).\"\n\nIn his First Apology, 55 Justin refers to various objects as shaped like the cross of Christ: \"The sea is not traversed except that trophy which is called a sail abide safe in the ship … And the human form differs from that of the irrational animals in nothing else than in its being erect and having the hands extended, and having on the face extending from the forehead what is called the nose, through which there is respiration for the living creature; and this shows no other form than that of the cross (σταυρός).\"\nThe apocryphal Acts of Peter, of the second half of the 2nd century, attaches symbolic significance to the upright and the crossbeam of the cross of Jesus: \"What else is Christ, but the word, the sound of God? So that the word is the upright beam (\"to orthon xulon\") whereon I am crucified. And the sound is that which crosseth it (\"to plagion\"), the nature of man. And the nail which holdeth the cross-tree unto the upright in the midst thereof is the conversion and repentance of man.\"\n\nIrenaeus, who died around the end of the 2nd century, speaks of the cross as having \"five extremities, two in length, two in breadth, and one in the middle, on which [last] the person rests who is fixed by the nails.\"\n\nHippolytus of Rome (170 – 235 AD), writing about the blessing Jacob obtained from his father Isaac (), said: \"The skins which were put upon his arms are the sins of both peoples, which Christ, when \"His hands were stretched forth on the cross\", fastened to it along with Himself.\"\n\nIn his Octavius, Marcus Minucius Felix (? — c. 250AD, Rome), responding to the pagan jibe that Christians \"worship\" wooden crosses – an indication of how the cross symbol was already associated with Christians – denies the charge and then retorts that the cross shape (a crossbeam placed on an upright) is honoured even by pagans in the form of their standards and trophies and is in any case found in nature: \"Crosses, moreover, we neither worship nor wish for. You, indeed, who consecrate gods of wood, adore wooden crosses perhaps as parts of your gods. For your very standards, as well as your banners; and flags of your camp, what else are they but crosses gilded and adorned? Your victorious trophies not only imitate the appearance of a simple cross, but also that of a man affixed to it. We assuredly see the sign of a cross, naturally, in the ship when it is carried along with swelling sails, when it glides forward with expanded oars; and when the military yoke is lifted up, it is the sign of a cross; and when a man adores God with a pure mind, with hands outstretched. Thus the sign of the cross either is sustained by a natural reason, or your own religion is formed with respect to it.\"\n\nIn language very similar to that of Minucius Felix, Tertullian, too, who distinguished between \"stipes\" (stake) and \"crux\" (cross), noted that it was the cross that people associated with Christianity. And he indicated that the shape of the cross is that of the letter T: \"The Greek letter Tau and our own letter T is the very form of the cross, which (God) predicted would be the sign on our foreheads\", and compared it to the shape of a bird with outstretched wings.\n\nThe anti-Christian arguments thus cited in the \"Octavius\" of Minucius Felix, chapters IX and XXIX, and Tertullian's \"Apology\", 16 show that the cross symbol was already associated with Christians in the 2nd century. Tertullian could designate the body of Christian believers as \"crucis religiosi\", \"i.e.\" \"devotees of the Cross\". In his book \"De Corona\", written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the sign of the cross.\n\nSo closely associated with Christ was the cross that Clement of Alexandria, who died between 211 and 216, could without fear of ambiguity use the phrase \"τὸ κυριακὸν σημεῖον\" (the Lord's sign) to mean the cross, when he repeated the idea, current as early as the Epistle of Barnabas, that the number 318 (in Greek numerals, ΤΙΗ) in was a foreshadowing (a \"type\") of the cross (T, an upright with crossbar, standing for 300) and of Jesus (ΙΗ, the first two letter of his name ΙΗΣΟΥΣ, standing for 18).\n\nFor other 2nd-century instances of the use of the cross, in its familiar form, as a Christian symbol, see the references in the Jewish Encyclopedia article on the cross:\n\nThe significance of the remains of Jehohanan, a man crucified in Palestine in the 1st century, has been interpreted in different ways, and in any case does not prove that Jesus was executed in the same way.\n\nThe Alexamenos graffito, which was once thought to be the earliest surviving pictorial representation of a crucifixion and has been interpreted as mockery of a Christian, shows a cross as an instrument of execution. Its date is uncertain: some have posited for it a date as early as 85, but it may be as late as the 3rd century, and even thus prior to AD 300.\n\nWhat now appears to be the most ancient surviving image of a Roman crucifixion is a graffito found in a taberna (an inn for wayfarers) in Puteoli, dating from the time of Trajan (98–117) or Hadrian (117–138). The cross has the T shape.\n\nIn Christian art Jesus is generally depicted as carrying a whole cross - patibulum and stipes.\n\nJehovah's Witnesses assert that the device used for Jesus' execution was a simple upright stake, and that the cross was adopted as a Christian symbol only under the 4th-century emperor Constantine the Great. The \"New World Translation\" of the Bible therefore uses the phrase \"torture stake\" to translate the Greek word σταυρός (\"stauros\") at Matthew 27:40, Mark 15:30 and Luke 23:26.\n\nA study edition of the \"New World Translation\" reproduces an illustration from a work by 16th century philologist Justus Lipsius showing a man suspended by the wrists on a \"crux simplex (ad affixionem)\" or upright pole. However, it omits Lipsius' other illustrations of such executions showing a traditional-style cross with cross-bar, in particular that which Lipsius considered to correspond to that of the execution of Jesus. James Penton, professor emeritus of history at the University of Lethbridge, Canada, comments: \"By showing but one illustration from Justus Lipsius' \"De cruce libri tres\" [...] Watch Tower scholars falsely leave the impression that Lipsius thought that Jesus was put to death in that way. In fact, Lipsius gives sixteen illustrations of impalement, thirteen of which show stakes with some sort of cross member.\"\n\n"}

First convicted of a 1974 murder, he was released in 1990 as an example of rehabilitation. He became a journalist and minor celebrity, but within months started killing again. After being convicted of an additional nine murders, he committed suicide by hanging himself in prison.\n\nUnterweger was born in 1950 to Theresia Unterweger, a Viennese barmaid and waitress, and an unknown American soldier whom she met in Trieste, Italy. Some sources describe his mother as a prostitute. His mother was jailed for fraud while pregnant but was released and travelled to Graz, where he was born. After his mother was arrested again in 1953, Unterweger was sent to Carinthia to live with his grandfather and his wife.\n\nUnterweger was in and out of prison during his youth for petty crimes, and for assaulting a local prostitute. Between 1966 and 1975 he was convicted sixteen times, mostly for sexual assault; he spent most of those nine years in jail.\n\nIn 1974, Unterweger murdered 18-year-old German citizen Margaret Schäfer by strangling her with her own bra, and in 1976 he was arrested and sentenced to life in prison. While in prison, Unterweger wrote short stories, poems, plays, and an autobiography, \"Purgatory or The Trip to Prison – Report of a Guilty Man\", that later served as the basis for a documentary.\n\nIn 1985, a campaign to pardon and release Unterweger from prison began. Austrian President Rudolf Kirchschläger refused the petition when presented to him, citing the court-mandated minimum of fifteen years in prison. Writers, artists, journalists and politicians mostly Socialists agitated for a pardon, including the author and 2004 Nobel Prize winner Elfriede Jelinek, Günter Grass, Peter Huemer and the editor of the magazine \"Manuskripte\", Alfred Kolleritsch.\n\nUnterweger was released on 23 May 1990, after the required minimum fifteen years of his life term. Upon his release, his autobiography was taught in schools and his stories for children were performed on the radio. Unterweger himself hosted television programs which discussed criminal rehabilitation, and worked as a reporter for the public broadcaster ORF, where he reported on stories concerning the very murders for which he was later found guilty.\n\nLaw enforcement later found that Unterweger killed a sex worker named Blanka Bockova in Czechoslovakia, and seven more in Austria in 1990 (Brunhilde Masser, 39; Heidi Hammerer, 31; Elfriede Schrempf, 35; Silvia Zagler, 23; Sabine Moitzl, 25; Karin Eroglu-Sladky, 25; Regina Prem, 32) in the first year after his release, all garroted with their bras. In 1991, Unterweger was hired by an Austrian magazine to write about crime in Los Angeles, California, and the differences between U.S. and European attitudes to prostitution. Unterweger met with local police, even going so far as to participate in a ride-along of the city's red light districts. During Unterweger's time in Los Angeles, three sex workers Shannon Exley, Irene Rodriguez, and Peggy Booth were beaten, sexually assaulted with tree branches, and strangled with their own brassieres.\n\nIn Austria, Unterweger was suggested as a suspect for the sex worker murders. In the absence of other suspects, the police took a serious look at Unterweger and kept him under surveillance until he went to the U.S. ostensibly as a reporter observing nothing to connect him with the murders.\n\nPolice in Graz eventually had enough evidence to issue a warrant for his arrest, but Unterweger had left by the time they entered his home. After law enforcement agencies chased him and his girlfriend, Bianca Mrak, through Switzerland, France, and the United States, he was finally arrested by the FBI in Miami, Florida, on 27 February 1992. While a fugitive, he had called the Austrian media to try to convince them of his innocence. He was extradited to Austria on 27 May 1992, and charged with 11 homicides, including one which had occurred in Prague and three in Los Angeles. The jury found him guilty of nine murders by a 6:2 majority (sufficient for a conviction under Austrian law at the time). On 29 June 1994, Unterweger was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.\n\nThat night, he committed suicide at Graz-Karlau Prison by hanging himself with a rope made from shoelaces and a cord from the trousers of a track suit, using the same knot that was found on all the strangled prostitutes.\n\nBased on psychiatric examination, Austrian psychiatrist Dr. Reinhard Haller diagnosed him with narcissistic personality disorder in 1994.\n\nPrior to his death, Unterweger asserted his intention to seek an appeal, therefore, under Austrian law, his guilty verdict was not considered legally binding after his death.\n\nIn a 2008 performance, actor John Malkovich portrayed Unterweger's life in a performance for one actor, two sopranos, and period orchestra entitled \"Seduction and Despair,\" which premiered at Barnum Hall in Santa Monica, California. A fully staged version of the production, entitled \"The Infernal Comedy\" premiered in Vienna in July 2009. The show has since been performed throughout Europe, North America and South America.\n\nIn 2015, Elisabeth Scharang directed a film called \"Jack\" about Unterweger.\n\nBroad Green Pictures is also developing a film \"Entering Hades\" starring Michael Fassbender.\n\nThe story of the police investigation, pursuit and prosecution of Unterweger is the subject of an episode of \"The FBI Files\" titled \"Killer Abroad\" (Season 2, Episode 14). He is also the subject of an episode of Biography titled \"Poet of Death\".\n\nAustrian musician Falco's controversial song \"Jeanny (Part-I)\" depicts a murder and rapist's thoughts, and its promotional video contains a number of references to crime scenes both real and fictional; while the \"news break\" in it (which is also heard in the song) refers in an oblique way to Unterweger, who was still in jail at the time of the single's release.\n\nThe ID Channel's true crime series Horror at the Cecil Hotel's premiere episode 1402 told Unterweger's story. The episode aired on Monday October 16, 2017.\n\nThe song \"The Legendary Jack\", is based in the strangler's life.\n"}

On 18 August 1998 at 3.00 a.m., massive landslides wiped away the entire village of Malpa in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand, then in Uttar Pradesh in Kali Valley of Higher Kumaon division of the Himalayas. The rockfall started on 16 August bringing down huge rocks which initially killed three mules. A total of 221 people died, including 60 Hindu pilgrims traveling to Tibet as part of \"Kailash Manas Sarovar Yatra\". One noted death was that of the Indian dancer Protima Bedi. The rockfall continued till 21 August. As the area lies in a seismic zone, the earthquakes of 1979 and 1980 may have been the underlying cause, as was attributed by a report of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology.\nThe landslide generated around one million cubic meters of rock fall and debris flow. This debris partially blocked the Sharda River. The landslide prevailed mostly due to steep, almost vertical, slopes of rock above the valley. In addition to the slopes, the proximity of the rock mass to major tectonic plates, major rainfall into the porous rock, and stress on the rock formations all contributed to the landslide. Natural disasters in the area have been attributed to ″unplanned construction and urbanization on the ﬂuvial and un-consolidated materials produced by active faults/thrusts in various sectors.″\n\nThe slide demonstrated the distressed state of rock in the Himalayan region because of the drift of the Indian plate northward.\n"}

{"id": "10095918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10095918", "title": "New York Fashion Week", "text": "New York Fashion Week\n\nNew York Fashion Week, held in February and September of each year, is a semi-annual series of events (generally lasting 7–9 days) when international fashion collections are shown to buyers, the press, and the general public. It is one of four major fashion weeks in the world, collectively known as the \"Big 4,\" along with those in Paris, London and Milan. The Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) created the modern notion of a centralized “New York Fashion Week” in 1993, although cities like London were already using their city’s name in conjunction with the words “fashion week” in the 1980s. NYFW is based on a much older series of events called “Press Week,” founded in 1943.\n\nIt has consisted of numerous branded events, such as Olympus Fashion Week New York and MADE Fashion Week, and many independent fashion productions around town.\n\nProducers of New York Fashion Week include IMG, The SOCIETY Fashion Week, FTL Moda in conjunction with Fashion Week Online, Style 360, Art Hearts Fashion, Style Fashion Week, and ASC Fashion week among others.\n\nA centralized calendar of citywide events (including those affiliated with WME/IMG) is kept by the CFDA, and was acquired from calendar founder Ruth Finley. Another calendar is kept by Fashion Week Online.\n\nThe economic impact of New York Fashion Week is estimated at $887 million.\n\nThe first New York Fashion Week was created in 1943 by Eleanor Lambert, press director of the American fashion industry’s first promotional organization, the New York Dress Institute.\n\nThe event, the world's first organized fashion week, was called \"Press Week\", and was created to attract attention away from French fashion during World War II, when fashion industry insiders were unable to travel to Paris to see French fashion shows. It was also meant to showcase American designers for fashion journalists, who had neglected U.S. fashion innovations.\n\nPress Week was a success, and fashion magazines like \"Vogue\", which were normally filled with French designs, increasingly featured American fashion.\n\nBy the mid-1950s, the event was known as \"Press Week of New York\". Spring 1951 (held February 1951) was the 16th Annual Press Week of New York.\n\nIn 1993, the CFDA, led by president Stan Herman and executive director Fern Mallis, consolidated the citywide events known as \"New York Fashion Week\" by staging them in a cluster of white tents in Bryant Park. The event was branded with the trademark \"7th on Sixth.\"\n\nIn 2001, \"7th on Sixth\" was sold to IMG.\n\nIn 2004, the camera company Olympus became a sponsor of IMG's events, which were then renamed \"Olympus Fashion Week.\"\n\nIn 2007, Mercedes-Benz became title sponsor of the IMG-produced events, adding New York to its roster of international \"Mercedes-Benz fashion weeks,\" and dubbing it \"MB Fashion Week New York.\"\n\nIn 2010, IMG/Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week New York left the Bryant Park tents, relocating to the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nIn September 2011, New York designers began live-streaming runway shows, following London, who began in February 2010. Streams were originally offered on YouTube, and later on other sites.\n\nIn 2013, IMG and its New York Fashion Week events were sold to William Morris Endeavor (WME) and Silver Lake Partners for $2.3 billion.\n\nIn 2014, the CFDA acquired FashionCalendar.com from Ruth Finley, who had managed it (originally in paper, then digital format) for more than 60 years.\n\nIn January 2015, Mercedes-Benz announced its departure as title sponsor from WME/IMG's events. Producer Kanye West announced he would gladly take over sponsorship of the event.\n\nIn March 2015, WME/IMG announced that it had acquired MADE Fashion Week, which takes place during WME/IMG's events.\n\nIn 2015, IMG's events were moved from Lincoln Center to Spring Studios.\n\nFollowing the loss of Bryant Park and later Lincoln Center as hosting site for New York Fashion Week, the event is no longer held in one central location. Locations have included a waterfront carnival, converted railway terminals and a former post office.\n\nIn February 2014, Dr. Danielle Sheypuk became the first wheelchair-using model to appear in a show for New York Fashion Week; she modeled for designer Carrie Hammer.\n\nIn September 2014, Karen Crespo became the first quadruple-amputee to walk at New York Fashion Week, also for Carrie Hammer.\nOn December 12, 2014, a New York state court approved a settlement in a lawsuit by community activists over whether allowing the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week tents in Damrosch Park was a violation of the public trust doctrine. In accordance with the settlement, the City of New York, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts agreed not to renew their contract with IMG. As a result, the February 2015 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week was the last one staged in Damrosch Park.\n\nThe fall/winter 2015 shows took place from February 12–19. In that week, actress Jamie Brewer became the first woman with Down syndrome to walk the red carpet at New York Fashion Week, which she did for designer Carrie Hammer.\n\nThe spring/summer 2016 shows took place from September 10–17, 2015 at two new locations, Skylight at Moynihan Station in Midtown and Skylight Clarkson Square in SoHo. The economic impact of these shows was estimated to be $900 million and attendance was approximately 125,000 people.\n\nIn December 2015, the CFDA announced that it had hired the Boston Consulting Group to study revising the format of New York Fashion Week to adapt to changes brought about by social media. One option being explored is to bifurcate the event, with private showroom appointments of next season's designs for buyers and public fashion shows displaying in-season merchandise for consumers.\n\nThe first New York Fashion Week dedicated menswear shows, called \"New York Fashion Week: Men's,\" were produced by the CFDA in 2015.\n\nFall/winter 2016 events took place February 11–18, 2016 at a variety of locations around New York City, including Skylight Moynihan, Skylight Clarkson, Chelsea Piers, MADE Studios, and showrooms around town.\n\nThe season ended with a number of designers either experimenting with, or planning to adopt, a \"see now, buy now model,\" with items available from the runway immediately after (or even during) the show, rather than six months later. The charge was led by brands such as Burberry, although experiments in the format can be traced back to earlier shows by designers such as Diane von Furstenberg.\n\nSpring/summer 2017 events will be held September 8–15, 2016. (Fashion weeks are traditionally named for the season the clothes will appear at retail, six months after the events, although the trend may be changing due to fundamental shifts in the retail cycle.)\n\nThe advent of \"see now, buy now\" shopping is expected to further transform fashion week, as collections become \"in season\" and select items are offered from the runway in real time.\n\nFall/winter took place February 5-8, 2018, and spring/summer 2019 will take place September 6-14, 2018. In February, major venues were Spring Studios, among others.\n\nAdmission to shows at New York Fashion Week is typically in the form of accreditation, with specific events by invitation only.\n\nIn spite of CFDA's claim to run the \"official\" New York Fashion Week calendar, and as further purported by publications such as \"Women's Wear Daily\", it has been pointed out in publications such as \"The Fashion Law\" that CFDA has \"little, in any, legal rights in the NYFW name\". Therefore, trademark rights remain unclear, at best.\n\nIn 2013 Fashion Week Inc., founded by Trisha Paravas, registered the trademarks “New York Fashion Week,” “NYFW”, and “NYFW The Runway Shows” to use in conjunction with the production of its consumer-based fashion shows. On June 28, 2016 Fashion Week Inc. filed a lawsuit for $10 million against CFDA and WME-IMG for trademark counterfeiting, trademark infringement, false designation of origin, dilution, and unfair competition.\n\nOn August 12, 2016, the court denied Fashion Week Inc.'s motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Koeltl held that CFDA and WME-IMG made \"a persuasive argument that the terms 'New York Fashion Week' and NYFW have been associated with them and not with [Fashion Week Inc.] who has attempted to cash in on the decades of publicity for New York Fashion Week that [Fashion Week Inc.] had nothing to do with.\" The court also noted that \"the evidence shows that [Fashion Week Inc.] produced at most two shows while using the trademark 'New York Fashion Week', and has produced no shows since registering NYFW in December 2015. \"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10957463", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10957463", "title": "New York Mining Disaster 1941", "text": "New York Mining Disaster 1941\n\n\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" is the debut American single by the British pop group the Bee Gees, released on 14 April 1967. It was written by Barry and Robin Gibb. Barring a moderately successful reissue of their Australian single \"Spicks and Specks,\" it was the first single release of the group's international career and their first song to hit the charts in both the UK and the US. It was produced by Ossie Byrne with their manager Robert Stigwood as executive producer. The song was the first track of side two on the group's international debut album, \"Bee Gees' 1st.\" This was the first single with Australian drummer Colin Petersen as an official member of the band.\n\nOn 3 January 1967, the Gibb brothers, with their parents and Byrne, set sail from Australia to England on the ship Fairsky, reaching Southampton on 6 February. The brothers performed on board in exchange for passage. Later, the Gibb brothers auditioned for Stigwood; they passed, and they signed to Robert Stigwood Organisation on 24 February. \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" was their first song that was written in 1967.\n\nThe first recording session of the Bee Gees after returning to England was a second version of \"Town of Tuxley Toymaker, Part 1,\" a song recorded by Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas, but was first recorded by Jon Blanchfield in Australia. Kramer's version was recorded on 4 March 1967 in IBC Studios, London, with the Gibb brothers on background vocals.\n\nBarry and Robin Gibb wrote the song while sitting on a darkened staircase at Polydor Records following a power cut. The echo of the passing lift inspired them to imagine that they were trapped in a mine. The song recounts the story of a miner trapped in a cave-in. He is sharing a photo of his wife with a colleague (\"Mr. Jones\") while they hopelessly wait to be rescued. According to the liner notes for their box-set \"Tales from the Brothers Gibb\" (1990), this song was inspired by the 1966 Aberfan mining disaster in Wales. According to Robin, there actually had also been a mining disaster in New York in 1939, but not in 1941.\n\nIn the second and third verses, the lyrical lines get slower and slower, as if to indicate that life is about to end for the miners. On the second chorus, the drums get louder. On the second verse, when Robin sings the line \"I keep straining my ears to hear a sound,\" a violin was featured in response on Robin's line.\n\nOn 7 March, the Bee Gees recorded \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" in six takes, along with three other songs: \"I Can't See Nobody,\" \"Red Chair, Fade Away,\" and \"Turn of the Century.\" The orchestra and some other parts were added on 13 March. \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" was done first, and it may have already been nominated as the first single on the strength of the Polydor demo.\n\nThe song begins in the chord of A minor; as Maurice explained: \"There's a lot of weird sounds on this song like the Jew's harp, the string quartet, and of course the special way that Barry plays that guitar chord. Because of his tuning when he plays the minor at the beginning of the song which is different from a conventional A minor, it's a nice mixture when I play my conventional tuning together with Barry's tuning because his open D and mine are different.\" Barry said, \"It's Hawaiian tuning, there they play the same way I do. I got a guitar for my ninth birthday and the guy who lived across the road from us just came back from Hawaii and he was the one who taught me that tuning, that's how it started and I never changed.\"\n\nRobin Gibb took both leading and backing vocals, singing the high harmony while Barry sang the low harmony on the first and second verse:\n\nMaurice Gibb recalled in a June 2001 interview with \"Mojo\" magazine: \"The opening chord doesn't sound like a conventional A minor. Barry was using the open D tuning he'd been taught when he was nine, and I was playing it in conventional tuning. It gives an unusual blend. People went crazy trying to figure out why they couldn't copy it.\"\n\nRobin Gibb recalled to \"The Mail on Sunday\" on November 1, 2009: \"We recorded this at London's IBC studio because it was dark and emulated a mining shaft. The result was a very lonely sound.\"\n\nAt the time, rumours circulated that the Bee Gees were The Beatles recording under a pseudonym (the Bee Gees' name was alleged to be code for \"Beatles Group\"), in part because the record referenced NEMS Enterprises (Brian Epstein's management agency, which had just been joined by Bee Gees' manager Robert Stigwood). The song is unusual in that the lyrics do not contain the song's title, though the originally planned title, \"Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones,\" does appear in the chorus.\n\nAtco distributed promos with a blank label and the suggestion that it was an English group whose name started with B. Many DJs thought it was a new Beatles song and played the song heavily. Atco also retitled the song \"New York Mining Disaster 1941 (Have You Seen My Wife, Mr. Jones?)\" to make sure people could find it in the shops.\n\nBeatles lead guitarist George Harrison met Maurice Gibb at a party several years later, and told him that he had bought a copy of \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" because he thought it sounded so much like The Beatles. Maurice's response to Harrison was that the resemblance \"was unintentional\" and Harrison said, \"I knew that, I admire your work.\" Barry Gibb explained about this song:\n\n\"If you sounded like the Beatles and also could write a hit single, then the hype of the machine would go into action, and your company would make sure people thought you sounded like the Beatles or thought you were the Beatles. And that sold you, attracted attention to you. It was good for us because everyone thought it was the Beatles under a different name.\"\n\nRobin Gibb explained about this track:\n\"...all the DJs on radio stations in the US picked it up immediately thinking it was the Beatles, and it was a hit on that basis. It established us in those early years. It helped our following record which was nothing like the Beatles.\"\n\nThe success of this song owes a lot more to the perseverance of Robert Stigwood than he has previously been given credit for. \"We had quite a hard time at getting the Bee Gees played. We weren't all totally convinced that Stigwood was picking the right song to plug, but at the end of the day, he was a forceful character. All of these guys were... Chas Chandler (manager of Jimi Hendrix) was the same, Kit Lambert (manager of The Who) was the same. They all argued their case with passion, you know, they lived it, they were like that,\" conceded Polydor's Alan Bates. When the \"Disc & Music Echo\" reported \"widespread rumours\" that this song had been written by Lennon and McCartney, Robin countered with, \"Rubbish! We've always written our own songs. I've been writing since I was ten, before Lennon and McCartney were even on stage. People can say what they like. If they don't believe us, they can ask The Beatles.\"\n\nBassist Maurice Gibb, though, had previously said that \"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" was in fact influenced by the Beatles:\n\n\"New York Mining Disaster 1941\" was a total rip-off of The Beatles, we were so influenced by them. In fact it started a mystery [in the USA] about us, because they started playing [it] and saying, 'They're this new group from England that begins with a B and finished with an s' so they all said, 'Ah, it's The Beatles, not naming it, they're doing that trick again.' The disc jockey would play it and play it and play it and, 'Guess who it is?' and people would guess, and they wouldn't get the answer. I heard [the idea] came actually from Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler. To us it was an honour, to actually think we were as good as The Beatles.\"\n\nOn the video, the band only features four members (but Vince Melouney later joined the band), Barry playing his guitar, Maurice playing his Rickenbacker 4001, Robin Gibb on vocals and drummer Colin Petersen wears a hat.\n\nThe group found time to record their first BBC session at Playhouse Theatre, Northumberland Avenue, London, with producer Bill Bebb, on which they performed this song, with the songs \"In My Own Time,\" \"One Minute Woman,\" and \"Cucumber Castle.\" When the BBC Light Programme's \"Saturday Club\" presented by Brian Matthew was broadcast on April 22, it was noted that there were \"rave reviews from the audition panel.\" On the song's promotional clip, the band only feature four members (the three Gibb brothers and drummer Colin Petersen) The group (Barry, Robin, Maurice, Colin and Vince) made their first British TV appearance on \"Top of the Pops\" performing this song on May 11 and were rather awe-struck at the company they were keeping. On 20 May 1967, the group performed this song on \"Beat-Club,\" a German TV program.\n\nThe Bee Gees performed this song on 21 July 1967 at the Stockholm Palladium, Stockholm, Sweden., 12 August 1967 at The Civic Hall, Wolverhampton, England and Christ the King College at Newport, England on 27 September 1967. Since 1967, the song has been part of every Bee Gees concert, eventually becoming part of their acoustic medley performed during the middle of the concert. It was also performed on the show \"Beat-Club\" in Germany, on that performance Robin wears a hat and plays violin. It was performed by the group in 1973 on \"The Midnight Special\" with Barry and Maurice on rhythm guitar.\n\n\nThe session was engineered by Carlos Olms and produced by Robert Stigwood.\n\nThe 1969 David Bowie song \"Space Oddity\" owes a debt to the style, arrangement and lyrics of \"New York Mining Disaster 1941.\" Like \"New York Mining Disaster 1941,\" \"Space Oddity\" is about a trapped man who is doomed to die, and the song is similarly structured as a series of statements addressed to another person. \"'Space Oddity' was a Bee Gees type song,\" Bowie’s colleague John \"Hutch\" Hutchinson has said. \"David knew it, and he said so at the time, the way he sang it, it’s a Bee Gees thing.\" As Marc Bolan explained: \"I remember David playing me 'Space Oddity' in his room and I loved it and he said he needed a sound like the Bee Gees, who were very big then.\"\n\nPaul McCartney said: \"It was the 'Mining Disaster' song that [Robert Stigwood] played me. I said 'sign them, they're great!' And they went on to be even greater.\"\n\nThe Japanese Novelist Haruki Murakami made \"New York Mining Disaster\" the title of one of his short stories. The piece was included in his collection \"Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman\".\n\n\n"}

The group is known for intervening in assaults by mobs in Cairo's Tahrir Square and is one of several that have begun to organize against sexual harassment of women in Tahrir since the 2011 Egyptian revolution.\n\nAlthough sexual harassment in the streets of Egypt predates the 2011 revolution, and is thought to have been a tactic of the Mubarak-era state used against female activists since 2005, reported cases of group sexual assaults during demonstrations in Tahrir square have been on the rise since 2011. The first to gain international attention was South African reporter Lara Logan, who was sexually assaulted by a gang of men on 11 February 2011, the night of Mubarak's resignation. It has been reported that at least 25 women were sexually assaulted in Tahrir during protests in January 2013 on the occasion of the revolution's two-year anniversary. In accounts collected by OpAntiSh and other groups and some published in social media, women describe being stripped, beaten, molested and raped.\n\nWhile some attacks appear to be spontaneous and stem from mob mentality, OpAntiSH activists believe that at least some of the sexual assaults are planned and carried out by organized gangs, to keep women from participating in the revolution's protests in Tahrir square. They point to the timing and patterns of the attacks and persistence of the harassers when confronted. Dalia Abdel Hameed, of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR) has said, “The easiest way to punish women in this country is through sexuality. In a culture that blames the victim, women start to believe that they shouldn’t go to the square.”\n\nOpAntiSH was established in November 2012 by volunteers, including those affiliated with Mosireen, an Egyptian revolutionary media group. OpAntiSH first appeared in Tahrir Square on 30 November 2012, during protests against President Mohamed Morsi's constitutional declaration, alongside groups like Banat Misr Khatt Ahmar (Egypt’s Girls Are a Red Line), which was founded earlier in 2012. OpAntiSH's campaigns against sexual harassment are supported by a coalition of organizations like Harassmap, which collects and maps crowd-sourced data about sexual harassment in Egypt, and Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, a human rights organization founded in 2002. OpAntiSH's slogan is \"A safe square for all.\" The group continues to gather new volunteers, some joining to help protect others after being rescued from sexual assault themselves.\n\nOpAntiSH uses a variety of methods to combat sexual harassment, in attempts to remove barriers to women's participation in street protests by keeping them physically and emotionally safe. Volunteers in the group conduct outreach and publicity to raise awareness of sexual harassment, and provide legal, medical, and psychological support as well as safe houses that can be used for recovery by women who have been assaulted. Hotline numbers are passed out on days of major protests. When assaults are reported, requests for help are routed using social media to teams of men and women carrying flares and spare clothing. These teams spread out across the square to rescue women as assaults are taking place, particularly during major demonstrations such as the one marking the two-year anniversary of the 2011 revolution on 25 January 2013. Because activists rescuing others are also in danger of assault, OpAntiSH estimates it needs at least 6 groups of 15 volunteers to spread protection across the square.\n\nVolunteers in the rescue squads are trained in an approach that has been developed based on the experience of mob assaults in Tahrir and past rescue efforts led by other individuals and groups in the square. OpAntiSH instructs rescuers to keep calm and avoid the use of force if possible, in order to diffuse mobs involved in the attack and minimize trauma to victims. The teams form a human chain around the woman being attacked, a female volunteer moves in to help clothe the victim, and group works together to bring her to safety.\n\nOpAntiSH believes that women's participation is important in rescue efforts both to engage with harassers and offer support to victims. “The solution is not just for men to defend us. We, too, have to participate. I believe it’s a women’s fight,” Reem Labib, one of the group's female activists, has said.\n\n\n"}

It will be held between July 26th and August 9th, 2018 marking the start of its 25th anniversary celebration.\n\nIn 1994, the idea of a chamber music festival in Ottawa came to life to remedy the meager availability of live classical music during the summer months and fill the city’s churches with splendid sounds. Ottawa Chamberfest started life as the Ottawa International Chamber Music Festival with 22 concerts in two churches and was an immediate hit. Growing steadily over the years, the 2011 edition of Ottawa Chamberfest presented almost 100 concerts, attracting over 80,000 listeners and is the largest chamber music festival of its kind in the world.\n\nThe members of the Juno award-winning Gryphon Trio (cellist Roman Borys, violinist Annalee Patipatanakoon and pianist Jamie Parker) are the Artistic Programming Directors for Ottawa Chamberfest.\n\nAmong those who performed in the 2011 edition of the festival were Jan Lisiecki, Isabel Bayrakdarian, Simone Dinnerstein, Marc-André Hamelin, Julie Nesrallah, Yehonatan Berick, National Arts Centre Orchestra, The Swingle Singers, Nexus (ensemble), Trio con Brio Copenhagen, New Zealand String Quartet, TorQ Percussion Quartet and more.\n\nPast performers include Paul Merkelo, Patrick Wedd, Guy Fouquet, Musica Camerata, Stéphane Lemelin, the Borodin String Quartet, the Beaux Arts Trio, the Tokyo String Quartet, Martin Beaver, Penderecki Quartet, Paul Stewart, Martin Chalifour, Monica Whicher, Jennifer Swartz, and Gino Quilico,Quartango, Neil Gripp, Richard Raymond, the St. Lawrence Quartet, Mayumi Seiler, Keller Quartet, and Adaskin String Trio.\n\nAlthough the concerts are primarily traditional classical music, the scope has evolved to include music by pop and jazz composers and also music from non-European countries. The concerts of a typical day would have several different types of music. For Ottawa Chamberfest 2011, performances are divided into several Concert Series.\n\nThe concert venues are generally churches or cultural facilities in the heart of downtown Ottawa. The confirmed venues for Ottawa Chamberfest 2011 are:\n\nIn previous years the University of Ottawa was also a regular venue. The Festival has also used, on occasion, Southam Hall in the National Arts Centre for special gala concerts.\n\nApart from the annual summer festival, which is the Ottawa Chamber Music Society's major event, the Society also organizes activities throughout the year. The Concert Series takes place from fall to spring offering approximately six concerts per season. There is also the Family Music Fair - a free day of musical activities for all to enjoy. An annual online auction raises money for the Society's operations.\n\n"}

The term \"paper organization\" is used in two different contexts, that of the military and that of the labor movement.\n\nFor the military, a unit which is not combat-ready due to a planned or unplanned lack of men or basic equipment, but which remains in existence on the books, is called a \"paper organization.\" Such a rating of an organization is a regular part of the planning process and the term is not pejorative.\n\nIn the trade union and radical political movements, a \"paper organization\" is a group ostensibly in existence for a specific purpose, but which remains a phantom. For example, a single individual might claim to represent a non-existing local unit of a national organization in attempt to gain admission as a delegate and thus help \"pack\" a national convention in favor of a particular faction. Such a phantom unit would be called a \"paper organization.\" Alternatively, the term can be used with regards to a single-interest group with an impressive name but no greater existence than a letterhead and a mailing address, and no concrete existence in fact. Some so-called Communist front groups were an example of this latter form of \"paper organization.\"\n\n"}

A public inauguration ceremony took place on Monday, January 21, 2013, at the United States Capitol building.\n\nThe inauguration theme was \"Faith in America's Future\", a phrase that draws upon the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the completion of the Capitol dome in 1863. The theme also stressed the \"perseverance and unity\" of the United States and echoed the \"Forward\" theme used in the closing months of Obama's reelection campaign. The inaugural events held in Washington, D.C. from January 19 to 21, 2013 included concerts, a national day of community service on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the swearing-in ceremony, luncheon and parade, inaugural balls, and the interfaith inaugural prayer service. The presidential oath was administered to Obama during his swearing-in ceremony on January 20 and 21, 2013 by Chief Justice of the United States John G. Roberts.\n\nIn his second inauguration address, Obama proclaimed that \"while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth\". He called for laws to combat climate change, enactment of immigration reform and gun control. Obama stated that more progress was needed on human rights and civil rights (including racial minority rights, women's rights, and LGBT rights). He vowed to promote democracy abroad and stated that the United States must \"be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice\" around the world. Additionally, the president vowed to keep existing alliances strong, emphasized the economic recovery and the end of wars, and stated that \"no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation\". During the speech, Obama linked the Seneca Falls Convention, Selma to Montgomery marches and Stonewall riots.\n\nApproximately one million people attended the inauguration, and millions more watched from around the world.\n\nThe inauguration was planned primarily by two committees: the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies and the 2013 Presidential Inaugural Committee. The committee began construction of the inaugural platform on September 20, 2012.\n\nThe swearing-in ceremony and the inaugural luncheon for President Obama and Vice President Biden were planned by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, a committee composed of United States Senators Charles Schumer of New York, committee chair, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Harry Reid of Nevada, and United States Representatives John Boehner of Ohio, Eric Cantor of Virginia and Nancy Pelosi of California. The committee is overseen by the U.S. Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\nMilitary support to the 57th inauguration was coordinated by Joint Task Force National Capital Region, providing musical military units, marching bands, color guards, ushers, firing details, and salute batteries.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, Louie Giglio was selected to deliver the benediction at the ceremony. Giglio at first accepted, but then withdrew in response to a controversy over a mid-1990s sermon \"in which he called on Christians to fight the \"aggressive agenda\" of the gay-rights movement\". The substitution of Rev. Luis Leon, pastor of Saint John's Church near the White House, was announced on January 15.\n\nMyrlie Evers-Williams, widow of civil rights activist Medgar Evers delivered the invocation.\n\nOn January 8, 2013, Richard Blanco was named the inaugural poet for Barack Obama's second inauguration, the fifth person to play that role. He is the first immigrant, first Latino, first gay person, and the youngest to be inaugural poet.\n\nThe 2013 Presidential Inaugural Committee organized several other inauguration-related events at the direction of the President and Vice President of the United States, such as the concerts, parade, balls and prayer service. The co-chairs of the committee were former Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush, along with Ambassador Matthew Barzun, Eva Longoria, Jane Stetson and Frank White. Other positions were held by Jim Messina, who oversaw the Inaugural parade, Stephanie Cutter, Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, Julianna Smoot, Rufus Gifford and Patrick Gaspard.\n\nOn the evening of January 19, 2013, Michelle Obama and Jill Biden hosted the \"Kids' Inaugural: Our Children. Our Future.\" event at the Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. Katy Perry, Usher, and members of the cast of \"Glee\" honored military families in concert. Other celebrity participants included Mindless Behavior, Far East Movement, and Nick Cannon, who served as emcee for the event. In keeping with the service theme of the day, Michelle Obama issued a call for children to become engaged in public service by volunteering in homeless shelters, visiting seniors, or writing letters to U.S. troops.\n\nSince 1937, the 4-year term of the President and Vice President have ended and begun at noon on January 20, as prescribed by the Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Because January 20, 2013, fell on a Sunday, both Obama and Biden were officially sworn in privately, and then again the following day in a public ceremony. This was the seventh time since the start of James Monroe's second term in office, in 1821, that the oath of office was officially administered in a Sunday private ceremony. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to the President on January 20 in the Blue Room at the White House. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor administered the oath to the Vice President on the same date at Number One Observatory Circle, the official residence of the Vice President. While reciting his oath, Biden's hand rested upon a Bible that had been in his family since 1893 and which he had used in every swearing-in ceremony since entering the U.S. Senate in 1973. Obama used a Bible owned by the family of First Lady Michelle Obama when he took his oath of office.\n\nThe public inaugural ceremony took place at the West Front of the United States Capitol on January 21, 2013. The ceremony opened with the playing of pre‑recorded music and a live performance of the Fifth-grade chorus from Public School 22, followed by \"The President's Own\" United States Marine Band. Senator Charles Schumer, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, acted as the day's Master of Ceremonies.\n\nMyrlie Evers-Williams, the widow of slain civil-rights leader Medgar Evers, delivered the invocation, followed by a performance of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" by the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir. Vice President‑elect Biden took his oath from Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor. After completing his oath of office as the Vice President, Biden received in his honor the first playing of four ruffles and flourishes and the march \"Hail, Columbia\" by members of the armed forces. This was followed by a performance of \"America the Beautiful\" by James Taylor.\n\nAfter the performance of \"America the Beautiful\", Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office to President‑elect Obama. After he had completed the oath of office as the President, Obama received in his honor the 21-gun salute and the first playing of four ruffles and flourishes and the march \"Hail to the Chief\" by members of the armed forces. Following the salute, Obama delivered his inaugural address to the crowds as the President of the United States at 11:53 AM Eastern Time, which was 2,137 words long and took 18.5 minutes to deliver, this was then followed by a performance by vocalist Kelly Clarkson, who sang \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\". Poet Richard Blanco then delivered the inaugural poem, followed by Rev. Luis Leon, who delivered the benediction. Vocalist Beyoncé concluded the ceremony with a performance of the United States national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\".\n\nDuring the public inaugural ceremony at the United States Capitol on January 21, Associate Justice Sotomayor administered the oath to Vice President Joe Biden, and then Chief Justice Roberts administered the Presidential oath to President Barack Obama minutes after Vice President Biden received his oath. At the public inaugural ceremony, Vice President Biden was sworn in using the Biden family Bible, while President Obama was sworn in using two Bibles owned by Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr. President Obama became the 17th U.S. president to be re-elected for a second term of office.\n\nAfter Barack Obama had recited the oath of office, where Obama had placed his left hand on Bibles owned by American civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr and President Abraham Lincoln, delivered his inaugural address. The inaugural address had a length of 2,137 words and President Obama took 18.5 minutes to deliver it between 11:53 a.m. and 12:12 p.m. In a speech \"heavy on broad rhetoric and light on policy specifics\" as noted by the \"Washington Post\" Obama's second inaugural speech was regarded as laying out a broad liberal or progressive agenda, supporting gay rights and climate change reform. Obama, who \"largely eschewed foreign policy except to recommend engagement over war, and instead focused on addressing poverty and injustice at home\", delved in broad strokes into the United States past and its future as he called on ordinary Americans to \"shape the debates of our time.\" Rejecting the belief that in America \"freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few\" and arguing that \"preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action\" Obama said \"now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle or substitute spectacle for politics or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act.\"\n\nBarack Obama used the opening words of the U.S. Constitution's preamble \"We, the people\" to suggest how to reconcile America's founding truths and the current discord and dysfunction of its embittered political system. He also referenced America's Declaration of Independence stating that our inalienable rights, such as Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, may be self-evident, but never have been self-executing. Obama again invoked the Declaration of Independence by telling his audience: \"What makes us exceptional, what makes us America, is our allegiance to an idea articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago: We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\"\n\nObama went on, saying \"all of us are created equal\" and that the shared equality of the American people guided the United States \"through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall\"—linking the Seneca Falls Convention, Selma to Montgomery marches and Stonewall riots as key moments in women's rights activism, the civil rights movement, and the LGBT rights movement in the United States together.\n\nAdditional words indicated a commitment to LGBT rights: \"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law—for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\" These words made Obama the first president to use the word \"gay\" as a reference to sexual orientation in an inaugural address. Some analysts interpreted his statement as a reaffirmation of President Obama's previously stated support for same-sex marriage. Others noted that all nine justices of the Supreme Court were seated nearby when Obama linked gay and lesbian rights to two other groups whom the court treats with special consideration: women and racial minorities.\n\nPresident Obama also spoke firmly about climate change, immigration reform, and gun control, and argued that they represented important issues for this generation to solve. Noting that \"none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms\" Obama stated that his administration \"will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.\" He also argued that America must lead in this area: \"The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries - we must claim its promise.\" \"That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God.\"\n\nObama commented on the role of government that \"Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time — but it does require us to act in our time.\" And he added while the American people never gave up their skepticism of a strong federal government, they also never believed that the government can fix all ills. In order to prepare America for a rapidly changing world U.S. President Barack Obama stressed the need for the political leaders of America to act in common cause. The president argued that \"now decisions are upon us and we cannot afford delay.\" Obama also made what appeared to be an oblique reference to the partisan battles between himself, the Republican-controlled House and the Senate - where Democrats have control but do not have a filibuster-proof majority. In reference to the unalienable rights of Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness Obama declared in the context of the partisan battles that \"[b]eing true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness.\" Obama said that the politically gridlocked capital — and, implicitly, the Republicans who have fought his ideas during the 2012 U.S. Presidential election — was moving too slowly at a critical moment. \"We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate,\" Obama said. \"We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.\" Obama added that \"the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction -- and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service.\"\n\nThe president also addressed the issue of wealth inequality in the United States noting that America \"cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well, and a growing many barely make it.\" \"We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American, she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own,\" he declared. Obama spoke of the need to reduce America's health care costs and America's deficit, but he repudiated that America must choose between \"caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.\" \"The commitments we make to each other — through Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security — these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us,\" Obama said. \"They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.\"\n\nWhile praising U.S. Armed Forces members for their bravery and strength, Obama asserted that \"enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.\" This statement was made in the foreign policy section of his inaugural address in which Obama promised diplomacy of engagement backed with military steel, but he did not dwell on specific crises like Iran. \"We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully - not because we are naive about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear.\" He also declared the United States \"must be a source of hope for the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice...\" and stand for \"human dignity and justice.\" Barack Obama also challenged those who favor aggressive use of the powerful U.S. military, calling them to remember the policies of presidents past. \"We are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war, who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends, and we must carry those lessons into this time as well,\" said Obama. Obama vowed America \"will remain the anchor of strong alliances\" and it will support democracy around the world.\n\nThe inaugural address made at several points references to famous speeches of America's former leaders. Barack Obama referenced Martin Luther King's I Have a Dream speech by noting that \"we cannot walk alone.\" Obama also made several references to past presidential inaugurations. He referenced the country's civil war experience and its slavery history with allusions to phrases used by Abraham Lincoln: \"Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free.\" This was an allusion to \"until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword\" from Abraham Lincoln's second inauguration address. The Inaugural address of John F. Kennedy was also referenced. Obama's \"this generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience\" and later description of \"brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle\" was an allusion to Kennedy's line of a \"new generation of Americans—born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace.\" Obama's assertion that America is willing to negotiate with its adversaries \"not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear\" was reminiscent of Kennedy's words that \"civility is not a sign of weakness … Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate.\"\n\nBarack Obama described the American state of affairs with references to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as well as the 2007–2009 recession in the United States as follows: \"This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. America's possibilities are limitless.\" Obama then added a collective call to action: \"My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it - so long as we seize it together.\" Noting that \"Decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay\" Obama stressed the need of shielding the weak, the poor and those lacking health care and demanded equality for all races and gay rights, and security from gun crime for children. In the \"Washington Post\", Chris Cillizza stated in this context that Obama's overall inaugural message was \"That we are all in this together and that we will ultimately be judged by how we treat the lowest among us.\" Cillizza pointed to five sentences of Obama's speech which contained not only Obama's agenda for his second term but also \"outlined what he wanted his second term to be—and to mean\":\n\nRichard Blanco read a poem he wrote for the occasion, \"One Today\". One critic called it \"a rare break from the staid custom of ceremony that the rest of the afternoon brought\" and another described it as \"art meant to orient, to reconfirm collective identity in a time of recent tragedy... an optimistic, careful piece meant to encourage, a balm.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of his inaugural address, Obama walked back into the Capitol building, then turned for a moment to look out at the National Mall, filled with hundreds of thousands of flag-waving Americans. He said to those close to him: \"I want to take a look one more time. I'm not going to see this again.\" Shortly afterward, he signed the Capitol's guest book.\n\nThen, in the President's Room of the U.S. Capitol, with the bipartisan congressional leadership looking on, Obama signed documents submitting the nominations of his nominees for several Cabinet posts, the secretaries of State, Defense and Treasury and the head of the CIA.\n\nObama then dined on bison and lobster with select members of Congress and guests in the Capitol's National Statuary Hall before returning to the White House in the inaugural parade.\n\nThe inaugural parade route ran along Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. from the U.S. Capitol, ending at the north face of the White House. During most of the parade, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama traveled in the armored limousine. The President and First Lady exited their limousine, walking on Pennsylvania Avenue for portions of the parade. Vice President Biden, and his wife Jill, also walked the parade route.\n\nIn a departure from the number of evening balls for the first Obama inauguration, only two official inaugural balls were held to on January 21 celebrate the second inauguration. President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama attended the Commander-In-Chief's Ball held for members of the U.S. military and attended the Inaugural Ball, an invitation-only public gala held as a unified celebration for all Americans. Both inaugural balls were held on January 21 at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC. Jennifer Hudson serenaded the Obamas as they danced to Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together\" during both the Commander-in-Chief's Ball and the Inaugural Ball. Other performers who were scheduled to perform at the inaugural balls included Alicia Keys, Black Violin, Brad Paisley, Far East Movement, Fun, members of the \"Glee\" cast, John Legend, Maná, Smokey Robinson, Soundgarden, and Stevie Wonder.\n\nOn January 22, a private staff-only inaugural ball was held for White House aides and administration staff, Obama for America campaign staff, and the Inaugural Committee staff, was held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, a tradition started by the President and First Lady during the 2009 inauguration to express thanks for the work of the staff. Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett provided entertainment for the group.\n\nPresident Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama led the group in the chant, \"fired up, ready to go\" that was carried over from the 2008 and 2012 election campaigns. President Obama expressed gratitude and honored the aides and campaign staff for their work, telling the group that \"'it makes [him] know that America's future is in good hands' ... 'as long as all of you understand the immense and incredible power that you possess when you work together, when you join voices.'\"\n\nDuring the staff inaugural ball, President Obama also paid tribute to Alex Okrent, a 29-year-old campaign staffer who died after collapsing at the 2012 Obama campaign headquarters in Chicago. Proceeds from ticket sales for the staff inaugural ball, where tickets sold at $10.00 apiece, were used to support a memorial fund for Okrent.\n\nPresident Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, Vice President Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, gathered at the Washington National Cathedral on January 22, 2013, for a national day of prayer. The prayer service was attended by dignitaries and guests of diverse faiths for a day of prayers, readings, and musical performances. As in the case of the prayer service for the 2009 inauguration, the theme of the interfaith worship service reflected inclusiveness and religious diversity, ranging from a mix of Protestant pastors, female Rabbi, Hindu, and Muslim religious leaders to Catholic and Episcopal bishops. Featured speakers at the prayer service included religious leaders from the National African American Clergy Network, Islamic Society of North America, in addition to the Metropolitan Community Churches that served as a spiritual refuge and place of worship for gay Christians.\n\nThe loudest response from the audience at the National Mall coincided with Obama's remarks supporting equal pay for women and equal treatment for sexual minorities, when he stated that America's journey to equality is incomplete \"until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts,\" and \"until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.\" Obama \"made history\" said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin when Obama connected the struggle of gay couple to the equal rights movement writ large. \"By lifting up the lives of LGBT families for the very first time in an inaugural address, President Obama sent a clear message to LGBT young people from the Gulf Coast to the Rocky Mountains that this country's leaders will fight for them until equality is the law of the land,\" Griffin said in a release. This was however rejected by Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, which has led campaigns against legalizing same-sex marriage. Brown said gay couples are \"already treated equally under the law.\" \"They have the same civil rights as anyone else; they have the right to live as they wish and love whom they choose,\" he said in a release. \"What they don't have is the right to redefine marriage for all of society.\"\n\nObama's second inaugural speech was regarded as laying out a broad liberal or progressive agenda, supporting gay rights and climate change reform. David Gergen, professor of public service and director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, for example, called the speech \"the strongest embrace of 20th-century liberalism since Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society. And Brian Balogh, a professor of history at the University of Virginia's Miller Center, added that Obama's second inaugural address mattered in comparison to previous second inaugural speeches \"because future historians will mark it as the moment that Obama explained why he is a progressive. The programs that Obama called for were characteristically liberal: reaffirming the social safety net, equal pay for women, etc. Nothing new here -- just the Obama classic. What differed this time, and what this moment was made for (to twist the president's own words) was articulating the progressive rationale for these programmatic ends. \"Preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action,\" Obama proudly told the nation.\" The \"Washington Post\"'s Zachary A. Goldfarb, who covers economic policy and the White House for the Post, rejected the notion that Obama's speech was liberal. He wrote: \"Obama did not advance a liberal agenda. A consequential one, certainly, but one that reflects centrist views or center-left ones at most. The agenda seems liberal only when judged against the liberal-conservative divide we're used to in Washington. [...] Obama's inaugural speech sounded liberal because he offered the kind of robust defense of government's role in the nation's life that has seldom been heard from Democratic politicians after President Bill Clinton declared in 1996 that \"the era of big government is over.\"\"\n\nRepublican congressional leaders had a muted, bipartisan response to Obama's second inaugural address and expressed their hope for cooperation between their party and Obama. \"There are plenty of areas of disagreement but there are also some things that, fundamentally, we agree on -- and that is this country is one of opportunity,\" House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said. He added that there were partisan differences over \"the way we get there to help everybody. ... Hopefully, we can bridge those differences.\" Cantor however warned, that, if Obama follows what Cantor called a liberal agenda, then that agenda it's not designed to bring Republicans and the president together. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stated in a written statement that every four years on Inaugural Day America shows the world that its major political parties can disagree with civility and mutual respect. McConnell wrote that Obama's speech was a \"fresh start\" to address the issue of federal spending and debt: \"Republicans are eager to work with the president on achieving this common goal and we firmly believe that divided government provides the perfect opportunity to do so. Together, there is much we can achieve.\" He also praised Obama's speech as \"a really good speech. People can criticize President Obama about a lot of things. But not his ability to communicate. I think he communicated to the American people a message of hope, a message of action and I liked it very much.\"\n\nOther Republicans were critical of Obama. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan said Obama mischaracterized Republicans' position on federal entitlement programs. \"No one is suggesting that what we call our earned entitlements – entitlements you pay for, like payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security – are putting you in a 'taker' category.\" Ryan contended that Obama made a \"switcheroo\" in his speech by suggesting that Republicans have referred to beneficiaries of those programs as \"takers.\" In reality, he said, that term refers to recipients of welfare and other non-\"earned\" entitlements. U.S. Senator Mike Lee, a frequent Obama critic, expressed his opinion that Obama chose not to unite the country, but to divide the American people. \"This is not the approach of a leader attempting to find solutions to problems but rather the tactics of a partisan trying to pick political fights. His vision for the next four years is clear: defend a broken system, ignore the fiscal crisis, and drive future generations further into debt.\" Other Republicans like John McCain (\"I didn't hear any conciliatory remarks\") and \"pundits from the D.C. establishment\" also complained about Obama's speech. \"The Washington Post\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Dana Milbank, for example, wrote that Obama's address \"was less an inaugural address for the ages than a leftover campaign speech combined with an early draft of the State of the Union address.\"\n\nWhile Professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University Julian Zelizer called the speech a \"powerful oration for a contentious moment in national politics\", Georgetown University professor Donna Brazile called it \"a deeply moving and patriotic speech\" and \"one of the most effective usages of the founding documents' principles as a supporting narrative -- drawing us from the past to the present to the future\" by \"a president sharing with the nation his values most personal and vision most spiritual.\" Oxford University historian Timothy Stanley wrote that Obama, compared to \"one of those \"bring us together\", delivered \"a more policy specific speech that reflected the difficult, partisan reality of 2013.\" Obama's moral commitment to gay rights - expressed in the words \"for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well\" was \"controversial but admirably courageous.\" For Maria Cardona, a former senior adviser to Hillary Clinton, \"Obama's message is still one of hope and change. [...] He gave his supporters hope he will continue to fight for them. He gave all Americans the assurance the country will continue to change for the better.\"\n\nSenior political columnist for \"Newsweek\" and \"The Daily Beast\" John Avlon lauded Obama for \"an audacious speech to the extent that Obama sought to reclaim politicized concepts like American exceptionalism from their conservative contexts, making the case that the combination of diversity and opportunity makes the American Dream possible for each new generation.\" But Avlon also criticed Obama writing that \"the scope of the speech was sprawling and dotted with policy references more suited to a State of the Union address. It was not tightly framed or focused on a single concept, nor was there a single clear phrase that summed up the speech, at least at first listen.\"\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter former deputy chief speechwriter Gordon Stewart wrote that Obama's \"magnificent\" second inaugural address was far better than his first inaugural address. Stewart lauded that Obama for emerging \"as a leader who has stopped splitting differences and is prepared to make choices and fight for them.\" According to Stewart both Obama's supporters and opponents have a clearer idea what Obama will do in his second term. Former CNN producer and correspondent Frida Ghitis complained that Obama devoted nearly all his inaugural speech to domestic issues and said that international disengagement isn't an option for American. According to Ghitis the aspirations Obama \"expressed for America are the ones he should express for our tumultuous planet.\" She expressed her hopes that Obama \"can remember America's leadership position and devote more attention to those around the world who see it as a source of inspiration and encouragement.\" After neglecting to mention a single foreign country by name during his address, The Economist concluded that Obama's \"second term will have little emphasis on foreign affairs.\"\n\nGergen noticed that Obama stressed equality in the tradition of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address and Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\". According to Gergen the speech Obama's was \"firmest attempt to build upon Lincoln and King - and in effect, his address made him their modern heir.\" President Obama's green jobs adviser in 2009, Van Jones, called Obama's speech \"offered the best rebuttal to date\" since \"President Ronald Reagan launched an era of anti-government politics with his first inaugural address.\". Comparing Reagan and Obama, Van Jones wrote: \"Instead of \"government is the problem,\" the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune. Instead of pinning blame for every social problem on the size of government, the president recognized both individual responsibility and the role of community in giving each child the opportunity to succeed.\" Van Jones noted both presidents invoked famous places of American history in their inaugural addresses but differed substantially in these places. While Reagan chose places of battles, Obama \"tied Stonewall in with Selma and cemented his declaration that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights are civil rights.\" David Rothkopf, CEO and editor-at-large of the FP Group (publishers of Foreign Policy magazine), wrote that Obama rightly demanded equal rights for gays and equal pay for women. According to Rothkopf Obama's words sketched an America better than what the Founding Fathers of the United States imagined. Rothkopf wrote: \"The great beauty of the speech was not in any particular phrase, but in that the man in question and the country he leads were in so many ways far beyond what the Founders could have imagined. And that, despite our natural tendency to glorify our origins, that this America was in virtually every way better than the one they offered up to us.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "265508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265508", "title": "Shadowlands (play)", "text": "Shadowlands (play)\n\nShadowlands is a play by William Nicholson. It was first shown as a television film in 1985, directed by Norman Stone and produced by David M. Thompson for BBC Wales. It was later adapted for the stage, premiering on Broadway in 1990 and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play. A third version was released in 1993 as a feature film directed by Richard Attenborough.\n\nThe play is about the relationship between Oxford don and author, C. S. Lewis and the American writer Joy Gresham. It began life as a script entitled \"I Call it Joy\" written for Thames Television by Brian Sibley and Norman Stone. Sibley was credited on the BBC film as \"consultant\" and went on to write the book \"Shadowlands: The True Story of C. S. Lewis and Joy Davidman\".\n\nThe story follows Lewis as he meets an American fan, Joy Gresham, whom he befriends and eventually marries. The story also deals with his struggle with personal pain and grief: Lewis preaches that one should endure suffering with patience, but finds that the simple answers he had preached no longer apply when Joy becomes afflicted with cancer and eventually dies.\n\nThe original television film starred Joss Ackland as Lewis, with Claire Bloom as his wife Joy Gresham. It won BAFTA Awards in 1986 for Best Play and Best Actress (Bloom).\n\nIt was subsequently adapted for the stage, opening at the Theatre Royal in Plymouth on 5 October 1989 before transferring to the Queen's Theatre in London on 23 October 1989, running until 8 September 1990. The stage version and subsequent movie gave Joy Davidman only one stepson instead of two. The production was directed by Elijah Moshinsky and starred Nigel Hawthorne as Lewis with Jane Lapotaire as Joy. It won Best Play in the Evening Standard Awards for 1990. Lapotaire was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress for her stage performance.\n\nHawthorne successfully took the role of Lewis to Broadway, playing at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre from November 1990 to April 1991 and again directed by Moshinsky.

{"id": "99293", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99293", "title": "Shape of the universe", "text": "Shape of the universe\n\nThe shape of the universe is the local and global geometry of the universe. The local features of the geometry of the universe are primarily described by its curvature, whereas the topology of the universe describes general global properties of its shape as of a continuous object. The shape of the universe is related to general relativity, which describes how spacetime is curved and bent by mass and energy.\n\nCosmologists distinguish between the observable universe and the global universe. The observable universe consists of the part of the universe that can, in principle, be observed by light reaching Earth within the age of the universe. It encompasses a region of space that currently forms a ball centered at Earth of estimated radius . This does not mean the universe is 46 billion years old; in fact, the universe is believed to be 13.8 billion years old, but space itself has also expanded, causing the size of the observable universe to be as stated. (However, it is possible to observe these distant areas only in their very distant past, when the distance light had to travel was much less). Assuming an isotropic nature, the observable universe is similar for all contemporary vantage points.\n\nThe global shape of the universe can be described with three attributes:\nThere are certain logical connections among these properties. For example, a universe with positive curvature is necessarily finite. Although it is usually assumed in the literature that a flat or negatively curved universe is infinite, this need not be the case if the topology is not the trivial one.\n\nThe exact shape is still a matter of debate in physical cosmology, but experimental data from various independent sources (WMAP, BOOMERanG, and Planck for example) confirm that the observable universe is flat with only a 0.4% margin of error. Theorists have been trying to construct a formal mathematical model of the shape of the universe. In formal terms, this is a 3-manifold model corresponding to the spatial section (in comoving coordinates) of the 4-dimensional spacetime of the universe. The model most theorists currently use is the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) model. Arguments have been put forward that the observational data best fit with the conclusion that the shape of the global universe is infinite and flat, but the data are also consistent with other possible shapes, such as the so-called Poincaré dodecahedral space and the Sokolov–Starobinskii space (quotient of the upper half-space model of hyperbolic space by 2-dimensional lattice).\n\nAs stated in the introduction, there are two aspects to consider:\nThe observable universe can be thought of as a sphere that extends outwards from any observation point for 46.5 billion light years, going farther back in time and more redshifted the more distant away one looks. Ideally, one can continue to look back all the way to the Big Bang; in practice, however, the farthest away one can look using light and other electromagnetic radiation is the cosmic microwave background (CMB), as anything past that was opaque. Experimental investigations show that the observable universe is very close to isotropic and homogeneous.\n\nIf the observable universe encompasses the entire universe, we may be able to determine the structure of the entire universe by observation. However, if the observable universe is smaller than the entire universe, our observations will be limited to only a part of the whole, and we may not be able to determine its global geometry through measurement. From experiments, it is possible to construct different mathematical models of the global geometry of the entire universe all of which are consistent with current observational data and so it is currently unknown whether the observable universe is identical to the global universe or it is instead many orders of magnitude smaller than it. The universe may be small in some dimensions and not in others (analogous to the way a cuboid is longer in the dimension of length than it is in the dimensions of width and depth). To test whether a given mathematical model describes the universe accurately, scientists look for the model's novel implications—what are some phenomena in the universe that we have not yet observed, but that must exist if the model is correct—and they devise experiments to test whether those phenomena occur or not. For example, if the universe is a small closed loop, one would expect to see multiple images of an object in the sky, although not necessarily images of the same age.\n\nCosmologists normally work with a given space-like slice of spacetime called the comoving coordinates, the existence of a preferred set of which is possible and widely accepted in present-day physical cosmology. The section of spacetime that can be observed is the backward light cone (all points within the cosmic light horizon, given time to reach a given observer), while the related term Hubble volume can be used to describe either the past light cone or comoving space up to the surface of last scattering. To speak of \"the shape of the universe (at a point in time)\" is ontologically naive from the point of view of special relativity alone: due to the relativity of simultaneity we cannot speak of different points in space as being \"at the same point in time\" nor, therefore, of \"the shape of the universe at a point in time\". However, the comoving coordinates (if well-defined) provide a strict sense to those by using the time since the Big Bang (measured in the reference of CMB) as a distinguished universal time.\n\nThe curvature is a quantity describing how the geometry of a space differs locally from the one of the flat space. The curvature of any locally isotropic space (and hence of a locally isotropic universe) falls into one of the three following cases:\n\nCurved geometries are in the domain of Non-Euclidean geometry. An example of a positively curved space would be the surface of a sphere such as the Earth. A triangle drawn from the equator to a pole will have at least two angles equal 90°, which makes the sum of the 3 angles greater than 180°. An example of a negatively curved surface would be the shape of a saddle or mountain pass. A triangle drawn on a saddle surface will have the sum of the angles adding up to less than 180°.\n\nGeneral relativity explains that mass and energy bend the curvature of spacetime and is used to determine what curvature the universe has by using a value called the density parameter, represented with Omega (). The density parameter is the average density of the universe divided by the critical energy density, that is, the mass energy needed for a universe to be flat. Put another way,\n\nOne can experimentally calculate this to determine the curvature two ways. One is to count up all the mass-energy in the universe and take its average density then divide that average by the critical energy density. Data from Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) as well as the Planck spacecraft give values for the three constituents of all the mass-energy in the universe – normal mass (baryonic matter and dark matter), relativistic particles (photons and neutrinos), and dark energy or the cosmological constant:\n\nΩ ≈ 0.315±0.018\n\nΩ ≈ 9.24×10\n\nΩ ≈ 0.6817±0.0018\n\nΩ= Ω + Ω + Ω= 1.00±0.02\n\nThe actual value for critical density value is measured as ρ= 9.47×10 kg m. From these values, within experimental error, the universe seems to be flat.\n\nAnother way to measure Ω is to do so geometrically by measuring an angle across the observable universe. We can do this by using the CMB and measuring the power spectrum and temperature anisotropy. For an intuition, one can imagine finding a gas cloud that is not in thermal equilibrium due to being so large that light speed cannot propagate the thermal information. Knowing this propagation speed, we then know the size of the gas cloud as well as the distance to the gas cloud, we then have two sides of a triangle and can then determine the angles. Using a method similar to this, the BOOMERanG experiment has determined that the sum of the angles to 180° within experimental error, corresponding to an Ω ≈ 1.00±0.12.\n\nThese and other astronomical measurements constrain the spatial curvature to be very close to zero, although they do not constrain its sign. This means that although the local geometries of spacetime are generated by the theory of relativity based on spacetime intervals, we can approximate \"3-space\" by the familiar Euclidean geometry.\n\nThe Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) model using Friedmann equations is commonly used to model the universe. The FLRW model provides a curvature of the universe based on the mathematics of fluid dynamics, that is, modeling the matter within the universe as a perfect fluid. Although stars and structures of mass can be introduced into an \"almost FLRW\" model, a strictly FLRW model is used to approximate the local geometry of the observable universe. Another way of saying this is that if all forms of dark energy are ignored, then the curvature of the universe can be determined by measuring the average density of matter within it, assuming that all matter is evenly distributed (rather than the distortions caused by 'dense' objects such as galaxies). This assumption is justified by the observations that, while the universe is \"weakly\" inhomogeneous and anisotropic (see the large-scale structure of the cosmos), it is on average homogeneous and isotropic.\n\nGlobal structure covers the geometry and the topology of the whole universe—both the observable universe and beyond. While the local geometry does not determine the global geometry completely, it does limit the possibilities, particularly a geometry of a constant curvature. The universe is often taken to be a geodesic manifold, free of topological defects; relaxing either of these complicates the analysis considerably. A global geometry is a local geometry plus a topology. It follows that a topology alone does not give a global geometry: for instance, Euclidean 3-space and hyperbolic 3-space have the same topology but different global geometries.\n\nAs stated in the introduction, investigations within the study of the global structure of the universe include:\n\nOne of the presently unanswered questions about the universe is whether it is infinite or finite in extent. For intuition, it can be understood that a finite universe has a finite volume that, for example, could be in theory filled up with a finite amount of material, while an infinite universe is unbounded and no numerical volume could possibly fill it. Mathematically, the question of whether the universe is infinite or finite is referred to as boundedness. An infinite universe (unbounded metric space) means that there are points \"arbitrarily\" far apart: for any distance , there are points that are of a distance at least apart. A finite universe is a bounded metric space, where there is some distance such that all points are within distance of each other. The smallest such is called the diameter of the universe, in which case the universe has a well-defined \"volume\" or \"scale.\"\n\nAssuming a finite universe, the universe can either have an edge or no edge. Many finite mathematical spaces, e.g., a disc, have an edge or boundary. Spaces that have an edge are difficult to treat, both conceptually and mathematically. Namely, it is very difficult to state what would happen at the edge of such a universe. For this reason, spaces that have an edge are typically excluded from consideration.\n\nHowever, there exist many finite spaces, such as the 3-sphere and 3-torus, which have no edges. Mathematically, these spaces are referred to as being compact without boundary. The term compact basically means that it is finite in extent (\"bounded\") and complete. The term \"without boundary\" means that the space has no edges. Moreover, so that calculus can be applied, the universe is typically assumed to be a differentiable manifold. A mathematical object that possesses all these properties, compact without boundary and differentiable, is termed a closed manifold. The 3-sphere and 3-torus are both closed manifolds.\n\nThe curvature of the universe places constraints on the topology. If the spatial geometry is spherical, i.e., possess positive curvature, the topology is compact. For a flat (zero curvature) or a hyperbolic (negative curvature) spatial geometry, the topology can be either compact or infinite. Many textbooks erroneously state that a flat universe implies an infinite universe; however, the correct statement is that a flat universe that is also simply connected implies an infinite universe. For example, Euclidean space is flat, simply connected, and infinite, but the torus is flat, multiply connected, finite, and compact.\n\nIn general, local to global theorems in Riemannian geometry relate the local geometry to the global geometry. If the local geometry has constant curvature, the global geometry is very constrained, as described in Thurston geometries.\n\nThe latest research shows that even the most powerful future experiments (like SKA, Planck..) will not be able to distinguish between flat, open and closed universe if the true value of cosmological curvature parameter is smaller than 10. If the true value of the cosmological curvature parameter is larger than 10 we will be able to distinguish between these three models even now.\n\nResults of the \"Planck\" mission released in 2015 show the cosmological curvature parameter, Ω, to be 0.000±0.005, consistent with a flat universe.\n\nIn a universe with zero curvature, the local geometry is flat. The most obvious global structure is that of Euclidean space, which is infinite in extent. Flat universes that are finite in extent include the torus and Klein bottle. Moreover, in three dimensions, there are 10 finite closed flat 3-manifolds, of which 6 are orientable and 4 are non-orientable. These are the Bieberbach manifolds. The most familiar is the aforementioned 3-torus universe.\n\nIn the absence of dark energy, a flat universe expands forever but at a continually decelerating rate, with expansion asymptotically approaching zero. With dark energy, the expansion rate of the universe initially slows down, due to the effect of gravity, but eventually increases. The ultimate fate of the universe is the same as that of an open universe.\n\nA flat universe can have zero total energy.\n\nA positively curved universe is described by elliptic geometry, and can be thought of as a three-dimensional hypersphere, or some other spherical 3-manifold (such as the Poincaré dodecahedral space), all of which are quotients of the 3-sphere.\n\nPoincaré dodecahedral space, a positively curved space, colloquially described as \"soccerball-shaped\", as it is the quotient of the 3-sphere by the binary icosahedral group, which is very close to icosahedral symmetry, the symmetry of a soccer ball. This was proposed by Jean-Pierre Luminet and colleagues in 2003 and an optimal orientation on the sky for the model was estimated in 2008.\n\nA hyperbolic universe, one of a negative spatial curvature, is described by hyperbolic geometry, and can be thought of locally as a three-dimensional analog of an infinitely extended saddle shape. There are a great variety of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and their classification is not completely understood. Those of finite volume can be understood via the Mostow rigidity theorem. For hyperbolic local geometry, many of the possible three-dimensional spaces are informally called \"horn topologies\", so called because of the shape of the pseudosphere, a canonical model of hyperbolic geometry. An example is the Picard horn, a negatively curved space, colloquially described as \"funnel-shaped\".\n\nWhen cosmologists speak of the universe as being \"open\" or \"closed\", they most commonly are referring to whether the curvature is negative or positive. These meanings of open and closed are different from the mathematical meaning of open and closed used for sets in topological spaces and for the mathematical meaning of open and closed manifolds, which gives rise to ambiguity and confusion. In mathematics, there are definitions for a closed manifold (i.e., compact without boundary) and open manifold (i.e., one that is not compact and without boundary). A \"closed universe\" is necessarily a closed manifold. An \"open universe\" can be either a closed or open manifold. For example, in the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker (FLRW) model the universe is considered to be without boundaries, in which case \"compact universe\" could describe a universe that is a closed manifold.\n\nIf one applies Minkowski space-based special relativity to expansion of the universe, without resorting to the concept of a curved spacetime, then one obtains the Milne model. Any spatial section of the universe of a constant age (the proper time elapsed from the Big Bang) will have a negative curvature; this is merely a pseudo-Euclidean geometric fact analogous to one that concentric spheres in the \"flat\" Euclidean space are nevertheless curved.\nSpatial geometry of this model is an unbounded hyperbolic space.\nThe entire universe is contained within a light cone, namely the future cone of the Big Bang. For any given moment of coordinate time (assuming the Big Bang has ), the entire universe is bounded by a sphere of radius exactly .\nThe apparent paradox of an infinite universe contained within a sphere is explained with length contraction: the galaxies farther away, which are travelling away from the observer the fastest, will appear thinner.\n\nThis model is essentially a degenerate FLRW for . It is incompatible with observations that definitely rule out such a large negative spatial curvature. However, as a background in which gravitational fields (or gravitons) can operate, due to diffeomorphism invariance, the space on the macroscopic scale, is equivalent to any other (open) solution of Einstein's field equations.\n\n"}

The emails themselves are often a form of training, but such testing is normally done in conjunction with prior training; and often followed up with more training elements. This is especially the case for those who \"fail\" by opening any email attachments, or clicking on any included weblinks - or if they were tricked into entering any credentials.\n\nThere is wide acceptance within the IT security field that technical measures alone cannot stop all malicious email attacks, and that good training of staff is necessary. Simulated phishing allows the direct measurement of staff compliance, and when run regularly, can measure progress in user behavior. Phishing simulation is recommended by various official agencies, who often provide guidelines for designing such policies. Phishing simulations are sometime compared to fire drills in giving staff regular practice in correct behaviour.\n\nSuch campaigns need to be authorised at an appropriate level, and carried out professionally. If such a technique is used carelessly it may breach laws, attract law suits and antagonise or traumatise staff. \n\nHowever, if employees are advised of a change to policy such that: \"the company reserves the right to send deceptive \"simulated phishing\" email to staff from time to time to gauge staff security awareness and compliance\", and training and guidance has been given in advance then such problems should not occur. Some organisations may choose to require users to give their consent by opting-in, and others may allow staff the option to opt-out.\n\nThe standard advice is that \"failing' staff not be shamed in any way, but it is appropriate and reasonable to provide supportive followup training.\n\nSome techniques, which might be effective and in use by malicious actors, will be normally be avoided in simulated phishing for ethical or legal reasons. These would include emails with content likely to cause distress to the recipient,\nor the use of third party trademarks; although it is also sometimes argued that this is covered by \"fair use\".\n\nSuch testing can be done in a number of ways. \n\nBecause organisations generally have a set of multi-layered defences in place to prevent actual malicious phishing, simulations will often require some whitelisting to be put in place at email gateways, anti-virus software and web proxies to allow email to reach user desktops and devices and to be acted upon.\n\nMost advice is that testing should be at done several times per year, to give staff practice in responding correctly, and to provide management feedback on the progress in staff identifying and reporting potentially dangerous email.\n\n"}

It features performances by some of the most popular groups largely of the alternative rock and metal spectrum. Other than 2008 and 2016, the event has taken place every year since its 1996 inception. SnoCore is marketed towards the winter sports culture.\n\nJohn Boyle and Rick Bonde established SnoCore as an entertainment opportunity for fans during the year's slow point in live music, the winter season. It would also serve as an excuse for bands to perform for Western mountain resort towns and go snowboarding. SnoCore originally focused predominately on punk and ska groups and routed through ski communities. But as it became a national tour, SnoCore aimed toward hard rock and heavy metal and engaged larger, more traditional concert venues. In late 1997, ARTISTdirect principals Marc Geiger and Don Muller, the former having also co-founded Lollapalooza, purchased the tour from Boyle. They still make a point to schedule dates in a number of resort towns despite having strayed somewhat from its original concept.\n\nCorresponding with its name, SnoCore features large video screens playing footage of freestyle snowboarding and skiing between performances. Local shops have set up at concerts and local resorts have tied in with them. However, SnoCore does not feature sideshows as showcased at the Warped Tour and remains strictly a musical festival. The tour commonly hosts a sponsor; examples include Airwalk in 1997, Levi's in 1999, and Winterfresh in 2005.\n\nOn March 10, 1998, Foil Records released the \"Sno-Core Compilation\" which features various bands that have partaken in the festival. In 2001, SnoCore split into two tours: the funk/jam based SnoCore Icicle Ball and the hard rock/heavy metal based SnoCore Rock. This carried on once more the following year.\n\nDuring the 2006 tour, stomach flu ran its course through all participating bands. Most severely affected was Seether frontman Shaun Morgan who, rather than cancel altogether, opted to perform acoustic sets for their last few shows. This alternative met with high approval from fans and influenced the group to release their first acoustic album, \"One Cold Night\".\n\nSaliva was scheduled to co-headline the 2009 tour but frontman Josey Scott needed more time to recover from a recent ulcer surgery. As a result, the band intended to cancel the first two weeks and substitute Scott with Walt Lafty of Silvertide beginning April 17. Ultimately, they decided in the interest of the fans to drop out entirely. This made the 2009 band lineup the leanest in SnoCore history.\n\nJägermeister sponsored the first Canadian SnoCore tour in 2010.

It is located on the Piazza De Ferrari.\n\nThe hall is named for Duke Carlo Felice, and dates from 24 December 1824, when the Most Excellent Department of Theatres was established. On 31 January 1825, local architect Carlo Barabino submitted his design for the opera house which was to be built on the site of the church of San Domenico. The Dominican monks were moved elsewhere without delay or ceremony, and the first stone of the new building was laid on 19 March 1826.\n\nThe inaugural performance of Bellini's \"Bianca e Fernando\" took place on 7 April 1828, even though the structure and decoration were not quite finished. The auditorium accommodated an audience of about 2,500 in five tiers (each with 33 boxes), a gallery above, and standing room in the orchestra pit. The acoustics were considered among the best of the time.\n\nFor nearly forty years from 1853, Verdi spent the winter in Genoa, but he had few strong professional ties with the Teatro Carlo Felice. In 1892, Genoa commemorated the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of America and to celebrate the occasion the Carlo Felice was renovated and redecorated at a cost of 420,000 lire (nearly £17,000). Verdi was approached to compose a suitable opera, but he declined the honour, making the excuse that he was too old. Alberto Franchetti's opera \"Cristoforo Colombo\" premiered at the Carlo Felice on 6 October 1892.\n\nThe hall was altered many times in the years 1859-1934, and remained remarkably unscathed by war until 9 February 1941 when a shell fired by a British warship hit the roof, leaving a large hole open to the sky and destroying the ceiling of the auditorium which had been a unique example of 19th-century rococo extravagance, its main feature being a wide circle of angels, cherubs and other winged creatures in brightly painted high relief.\n\nFurther damage was sustained on 5 August 1943 when incendiary bombs started a backstage fire which destroyed all scenery and wooden fittings, but did not reach the main auditorium. Unfortunately additional damage was caused by looters who stripped the back of the theatre of every possible scrap of metal they could find. Finally, an air raid in September 1944 caused the destruction of the front of the theatre leaving virtually only the outside walls and the corridors behind the tiers of boxes standing. What had been the most richly beautiful of opera houses had become a skeleton of bare walls and roofless porticos.\n\nReconstruction plans began immediately after the war's close. The first design by Paolo Antonio Chessa (1951) was rejected; the second by Carlo Scarpa was approved in 1977 but brought to a halt by his untimely death. Aldo Rossi ultimately provided today's design, in which portions of the original facade have been recreated but the interior is entirely modern. The hall officially reopened in June 1991, with a main hall holding up to 2,000 seats and a smaller auditorium holding up to 200 seats.\n\nThe theatre is the main location of the concert seasons of Giovine Orchestra Genovese, a concert society founded in Genoa in 1912.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "418820", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=418820", "title": "The Turk", "text": "The Turk\n\nThe Turk, also known as the Mechanical Turk or Automaton Chess Player (, \"chess Turk\"; ), was a fake chess-playing machine constructed in the late 18th century. From 1770 until its destruction by fire in 1854 it was exhibited by various owners as an automaton, though it was eventually revealed to be an elaborate hoax. Constructed and unveiled in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen (Hungarian: Kempelen Farkas; 1734–1804) to impress the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, as well as perform the knight's tour, a puzzle that requires the player to move a knight to occupy every square of a chessboard exactly once.\n\nThe Turk was in fact a mechanical illusion that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The device was later purchased in 1804 and exhibited by Johann Nepomuk Mälzel. The chess masters who secretly operated it included Johann Allgaier, Boncourt, Aaron Alexandre, William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger, but the operators within the mechanism during Kempelen's original tour remain a mystery.\n\nKempelen was inspired to build the Turk following his attendance at the court of Maria Theresa of Austria at Schönbrunn Palace, where François Pelletier was performing an illusion act. An exchange afterward resulted in Kempelen promising to return to the Palace with an invention that would top the illusions.\nThe result of the challenge was the Automaton Chess-player, known in modern times as the Turk. The machine consisted of a life-sized model of a human head and torso, with a black beard and grey eyes, and dressed in Ottoman robes and a turban – \"the traditional costume\", according to journalist and author Tom Standage, \"of an oriental sorcerer\". Its left arm held a long Ottoman smoking pipe while at rest, while its right lay on the top of a large cabinet that measured about three-and-a-half feet (110 cm) long, two feet (60 cm) wide, and two-and-a-half feet (75 cm) high. Placed on the top of the cabinet was a chessboard, which measured eighteen inches square. The front of the cabinet consisted of three doors, an opening, and a drawer, which could be opened to reveal a red and white ivory chess set.\n\nThe interior of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to clockwork. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open at the same time one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as brass structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.\n\nNeither the clockwork visible to the left side of the machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the operator inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.\n\nThe chessboard on the top of the cabinet was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the operator inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the operator to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.\n\nAs a further means of misdirection, the Turk came with a small wooden coffin-like box that the presenter would place on the top of the cabinet. While Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a later owner of the machine, did not use the box, Kempelen often peered into the box during play, suggesting that the box controlled some aspect of the machine. The box was believed by some to have supernatural power; Karl Gottlieb von Windisch wrote in his 1784 book \"Inanimate Reason\" that \"[o]ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten the tales she had been told in her youth … went and hid herself in a window seat, as distant as she could from the \"evil spirit,\" which she firmly believed possessed the machine\".\n\nThe interior also contained a pegboard chess board connected to a pantograph-style series of levers that controlled the model's left arm. The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously move the arm of the Turk over the chessboard on the cabinet. The range of motion allowed the operator to move the Turk's arm up and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk's hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the operator by using a simple candle, which had a ventilation system through the model. Other parts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for the Turk to make various facial expressions. A voice box was added following the Turk's acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say \"Échec!\" (French for \"check\") during matches.\n\nAn operator inside the machine also had tools to assist in communicating with the presenter outside. Two brass discs equipped with numbers were positioned opposite each other on the inside and outside of the cabinet. A rod could rotate the discs to the desired number, which acted as a code between the two.\n\nThe Turk made its debut in 1770 at Schönbrunn Palace, about six months after Pelletier's act. Kempelen addressed the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet, allowing members of the audience to inspect the machine. Following this display, Kempelen would announce that the machine was ready for a challenger.\n\nKempelen would inform the player that the Turk would use the white pieces and have the first move. Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it threatened its opponent's queen, and three times upon placing the king in check. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent's move. Louis Dutens, a traveller who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine \"by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her\". Kempelen made it a point to traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and lodestones to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first person to play against the Turk was Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, an Austrian courtier at the palace. Along with other challengers that day, he was quickly defeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played aggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.\n\nAnother part of the machine's exhibition was the completion of the knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the operator with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.\n\nThe Turk also had the ability to converse with spectators using a letter board. The operator, whose identity during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown, was able to do this in English, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in Leipzig and published it in 1789 as \"Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung\" (or \"On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica\"). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and its secret workings.\n\nFollowing word of its debut, interest in the machine grew across Europe. Kempelen, however, was more interested in his other projects and avoided exhibiting the Turk, often lying about the machine's repair status to prospective challengers. Von Windisch wrote at one point that Kempelen \"refused the entreaties of his friends, and a crowd of curious persons from all countries, the satisfaction of seeing this far-famed machine\". In the decade following its debut at Schönbrunn Palace the Turk only played one opponent, Sir Robert Murray Keith, a Scottish noble, and Kempelen went as far as dismantling the Turk entirely following the match. Kempelen was quoted as referring to the invention as a \"mere bagatelle\", as he was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue work on steam engines and machines that replicated human speech.\n\nIn 1781, Kempelen was ordered by Emperor Joseph II to reconstruct the Turk and deliver it to Vienna for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia and his wife. The appearance was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of Europe for the Turk, a request to which Kempelen reluctantly agreed.\nThe Turk began its European tour in 1783, beginning with an appearance in France in April. A stop at Versailles preceded an exhibition in Paris, where the Turk lost a match to Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne, the . Upon arrival in Paris in May 1783, it was displayed to the public and played a variety of opponents, including a lawyer named Mr. Bernard who was a second rank in chess ability. Following the sessions at Versailles, demands increased for a match with François-André Danican Philidor, who was considered the best chess player of his time. Moving to the Café de la Régence, the machine played many of the most skilled players, often losing (e.g. against Bernard and Verdoni), until securing a match with Philidor at the Académie des Sciences. While Philidor won his match with the Turk, Philidor's son noted that his father called it \"his most fatiguing game of chess ever!\" The Turk's final game in Paris was against Benjamin Franklin, who was serving as ambassador to France from the United States. Franklin reportedly enjoyed the game with the Turk and was interested in the machine for the rest of his life, keeping a copy of Philip Thicknesse's book \"The Speaking Figure and the Automaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected\" in his personal library.\n\nFollowing his tour of Paris, Kempelen moved the Turk to London, where it was exhibited daily for five shillings. Thicknesse, known in his time as a skeptic, sought out the Turk in an attempt to expose the inner workings of the machine. While he respected Kempelen as \"a very ingenious man\", he asserted that the Turk was an elaborate hoax with a small child inside the machine, describing the machine as \"a complicated piece of clockwork ... which is nothing more, than one, of many other ingenious devices, to misguide and delude the observers\".\n\nAfter a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk travelled to Leipzig, stopping in various European cities along the way. From Leipzig, it went to Dresden, where Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz viewed the Turk and published his findings in \"Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung\", along with illustrations showing his beliefs about how the machine operated. It then moved to Amsterdam, after which Kempelen is said to have accepted an invitation to the Sanssouci palace in Potsdam of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia. The story goes that Frederick enjoyed the Turk so much that he paid a large sum of money to Kempelen in exchange for the Turk's secrets. Frederick never gave the secret away, but was reportedly disappointed to learn how the machine worked. This story is almost certainly apocryphal; there is no evidence of the Turk's encounter with Frederick, the first mention of which comes in the early 19th century, by which time the Turk was also incorrectly said to have played against George III of England. It seems most likely that the machine stayed dormant at Schönbrunn Palace for over two decades, although Kempelen attempted unsuccessfully to sell it in his final years. Kempelen died at the age of 70 on 26 March 1804.\n\nFollowing the death of Kempelen, the Turk remained unexhibited until 1805 when Kempelen's son decided to sell it to Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a Bavarian musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of metronome, had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 francs; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.\n\nUpon acquiring the Turk, Mälzel had to learn its secrets and make some repairs to get it back in working order. His stated goal was to make explaining the Turk a greater challenge. While the completion of this goal took ten years, the Turk still made appearances, most notably with Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nIn 1809, Napoleon I of France arrived at Schönbrunn Palace to play the Turk. According to an eyewitness report, Mälzel took responsibility for the construction of the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon before the start of the match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a shawl around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.\n\nIn 1811, Mälzel brought the Turk to Milan for a performance with Eugène de Beauharnais, the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais enjoyed the machine so much that he offered to purchase it from Mälzel. After some serious bargaining, Beauharnais acquired the Turk for 30,000 francs – three times what Mälzel had paid – and kept it for four years. In 1815, Mälzel returned to Beauharnais in Munich and asked to buy the Turk back. Two versions of how much he had to pay exist, eventually working out an agreement. One version appeared in the France Letter \"Palamede\". The complete story does not make a lot of sense since Mälzel visited Paris again, and he also could import his \"Conflagration of Moscow\".\n\nFollowing the repurchase, Mälzel brought the Turk back to Paris where he made acquaintances of many of the leading chess players at Café de la Régence. Mälzel stayed in France with the machine until 1818, when he moved to London and held a number of performances with the Turk and many of his other machines. In London, Mälzel and his act received a large amount of press, and he continued improving the machine, ultimately installing a voice box so the machine could say \"Échec!\" when placing a player in check.\n\nIn 1819, Mälzel took the Turk on a tour of the United Kingdom. There were several new developments in the act, such as allowing the opponent the first move and eliminating the king's bishop's pawn from the Turk's pieces. This pawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.\n\nThe appearances of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, and he continued by taking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in New York City that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel's problem was finding a proper operator for the machine, having trained an unknown woman in France before coming to the United States. He ended up recalling a former operator, William Schlumberger, from Alsace in Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.\n\nUpon Schlumberger's arrival, the Turk debuted in Boston, Mälzel spinning a story that the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the Boston players were much better opponents. This was a success for many weeks, and the tour moved to Philadelphia for three months. Following Philadelphia, the Turk moved to Baltimore, where it played for a number of months, including losing a match against Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. The exhibition in Baltimore brought news that two brothers had constructed their own machine, the Walker Chess-player. Mälzel viewed the competing machine and attempted to buy it, but the offer was declined and the duplicate machine toured for a number of years, never receiving the fame that Mälzel's machine did and eventually falling into obscurity.\n\nMälzel continued with exhibitions around the United States until 1828, when he took some time off and visited Europe, returning in 1829. Throughout the 1830s, he continued to tour the United States, exhibiting the machine as far west as the Mississippi River and visiting Canada. In Richmond, Virginia, the Turk was observed by Edgar Allan Poe, who was writing for the \"Southern Literary Messenger\". Poe's essay \"Maelzel's Chess Player\" was published in April 1836 and is the most famous essay on the Turk, even though many of Poe's hypotheses were incorrect (such as that a chess-playing machine must always win).\n\nMälzel eventually took the Turk on his second tour to Havana, Cuba. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of yellow fever, leaving Mälzel without a operator for his machine. Dejected, Mälzel died at sea in 1838 at the age of 66 during his return trip, leaving his machinery with the ship captain.\n\nUpon the return of the ship on which Mälzel died, his various machines, including the Turk, fell into the hands of a friend of Mälzel's, the businessman John Ohl. He attempted to auction off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought it himself for $400. Only when John Kearsley Mitchell from Philadelphia, Edgar Allan Poe's personal physician and an admirer of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk change hands again. Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.\n\nAs interest in the Turk outgrew its location, Mitchell and his club chose to donate the machine to the Chinese Museum of Charles Willson Peale. While the Turk still occasionally gave performances, it was eventually relegated to the corners of the museum and forgotten about until 5 July 1854, when a fire that started at the National Theater in Philadelphia reached the Museum and destroyed the Turk. Mitchell believed he had heard \"through the struggling flames ... the last words of our departed friend, the sternly whispered, oft repeated syllables, 'echec! echec!!\n\nJohn Gaughan, an American manufacturer of equipment for magicians based in Los Angeles, spent $120,000 building his own version of Kempelen's machine over a five-year period from 1984. The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a computer running a chess program.\n\nWhile many books and articles were written during the Turk's life about how it worked, most were inaccurate, drawing incorrect inferences from external observation.\n\nIt was not until Dr. Silas Mitchell's series of articles for \"The Chess Monthly\" that the secret was fully revealed. Mitchell, son of the final private owner of the Turk, wrote that \"no secret was ever kept as the Turk's has been. Guessed at, in part, many times, no one of the several explanations ... ever solved this amusing puzzle\". As the Turk was lost to fire at the time of this publication, Silas Mitchell felt that there were \"no longer any reasons for concealing from the amateurs of chess, the solution to this ancient enigma\".\n\nThe most important biographical history about the Chess-player and Mälzel was presented in \"The Book of the First American Chess Congress\", published by Daniel Willard Fiske in 1857. The account, \"The Automaton Chess-Player in America,\" was written by Professor George Allen of Philadelphia, in the form of a letter to William Lewis, one of the former operators of the chess automaton.\n\nIn 1859, a letter published in the \"Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch\" by William F. Kummer, who worked as a operator under John Mitchell, revealed another piece of the secret: a candle inside the cabinet. A series of tubes led from the lamp to the turban of the Turk for ventilation. The smoke rising from the turban would be disguised by the smoke coming from the other candelabra in the area where the game was played.\n\nLater in 1859, an uncredited article appeared in \"Littell's Living Age\" that purported to be the story of the Turk from French magician Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin. This was rife with errors ranging from dates of events to a story of a Polish officer whose legs were amputated, but ended up being rescued by Kempelen and smuggled back to Russia inside the machine.\n\nA new article about the Turk did not turn up until 1899, when \"The American Chess Magazine\" published an account of the Turk's match with Napoleon Bonaparte. The story was basically a review of previous accounts, and a substantive published account would not appear until 1947, when \"Chess Review\" published articles by Kenneth Harkness and Jack Straley Battell that amounted to a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new diagrams that synthesized information from previous publications. Another article written in 1960 for \"American Heritage\" by Ernest Wittenberg provided new diagrams describing how the operator sat inside the cabinet.\n\nIn Henry A. Davidson's 1945 publication \"A Short History of Chess\", significant weight is given to Poe's essay which erroneously suggested that the player sat inside the Turk figure, rather than on a moving seat inside the cabinet. A similar error would occur in Alex G. Bell's 1978 book \"The Machine Plays Chess\", which falsely asserted that \"the operator was a trained boy (or very small adult) who followed the directions of the chess player who was hidden elsewhere on stage or in the theater…\"\n\nMore books were published about the Turk toward the end of the 20th century. Along with Bell's book, Charles Michael Carroll's \"The Great Chess Automaton\" (1975) focused more on the studies of the Turk. Bradley Ewart's \"Chess: Man vs. Machine\" (1980) discussed the Turk as well as other purported chess-playing automatons.\n\nIt was not until the creation of Deep Blue, IBM's attempt at a computer that could challenge the world's best players, that interest increased again, and two more books were published: Gerald M. Levitt's \"The Turk, Chess Automaton\" (2000), and Tom Standage's \"The Turk: The Life and Times of the Famous Eighteenth-Century Chess-Playing Machine\", published in 2002. The Turk was used as a personification of Deep Blue in the 2003 documentary \"\".\n\nOwing to the Turk's popularity and mystery, its construction inspired a number of inventions and imitations, including Ajeeb, or \"The Egyptian\", an American imitation built by Charles Hopper that President Grover Cleveland played in 1885, and Mephisto, the self-described \"most famous\" machine, of which little is known. The first imitation was made while Mälzel was in Baltimore. Created by the Brothers Walker, the \"American Chess Player\" made its debut in May 1827 in New York. El Ajedrecista was built in 1912 by Leonardo Torres y Quevedo as a chess-playing automaton and made its public debut during the Paris World Fair of 1914. Capable of playing rook and king versus king endgames using electromagnets, it was the first true chess-playing automaton, and a precursor of sorts to Deep Blue.\n\nThe Turk was visited in London by Rev. Edmund Cartwright in 1784. He was so intrigued by the Turk that he would later question whether \"it is more difficult to construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make all the variety of moves required in that complicated game\". Cartwright would patent the prototype for a power loom within the year. Sir Charles Wheatstone, an inventor, saw a later appearance of the Turk while it was owned by Mälzel. He also saw some of Mälzel's speaking machines, and Mälzel later presented a demonstration of the speaking machines to the researcher and his teenage son. Alexander Graham Bell obtained a copy of a book by Wolfgang von Kempelen on speaking machines after being inspired by seeing a similar machine built by Wheatstone; Bell went on to file the first successful patent for the telephone.\n\nA play, \"The Automaton Chess Player\", was presented in New York City in 1845. The advertising, as well as an article that appeared in \"The Illustrated London News\", claimed that the play featured Kempelen's Turk, but it was in fact a copy of the Turk created by J. Walker, who had earlier presented the Walker Chess-player.\n\nRaymond Bernard's silent feature film \"The Chess Player\" (\"The Chess Player\", France 1927) weaves elements from the real story of the Turk into an adventure tale set in the aftermath of the first of the Partitions of Poland in 1772. The film's \"Baron von Kempelen\" helps a dashing young Polish nationalist on the run from the occupying Russians, who also happens to be an expert chess player, by hiding him inside a chess playing automaton called the Turk, closely based on the real Kempelen model. Just as they are about to escape over the border, the Baron is summoned to Saint Petersburg to present the Turk to the empress Catherine II. In an echo of the Napoleon incident, Catherine attempts to cheat the Turk, who wipes all the pieces from the board in response.\n\nThe Turk has also inspired works of literary fiction. In 1849, just a few years before the Turk was destroyed, Edgar Allan Poe published a tale \"Von Kempelen and His Discovery\". Ambrose Bierce's short story \"Moxon's Master\", published in 1909, is a morbid tale about a chess-playing automaton that resembles the Turk. In 1938, John Dickson Carr published \"The Crooked Hinge\", a locked-room mystery in his line of Dr. Gideon Fell detective novels. Among the puzzles presented included an automaton that operates in a way that is unexplainable to the characters. Gene Wolfe's 1977 science fiction short story \"The Marvellous Brass Chessplaying Automaton\" also features a device very similar to the Turk. Robert Loehr's 2007 novel \"The Chess Machine\" (published in the UK as \"The Secrets of the Chess Machine\") focuses on the man inside the machine. F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre's 2007 story \"The Clockwork Horror\" reconstructs Edgar Allan Poe's original encounter with Mälzel's chess-player, and also establishes (from contemporary advertisements in a Richmond newspaper) precisely when and where this encounter took place.\n\nWalter Benjamin alludes to the Mechanical Turk in the first thesis of his \"Theses on the Philosophy of History\" (\"Über den Begriff der Geschichte\"), written in 1940.\n\nIn 2005, Amazon.com launched the Amazon Mechanical Turk. The Web-based software application coordinates programming tasks with human intelligence, inspired in part by the way Kempelen's Turk operated. The program is designed to have humans perform tasks with which computers struggle, such as color comparisons.\n\n\n"}

The first two coaches of the passenger train overturned onto their sides and three passengers were killed; 17 passengers and the driver were injured.\n\nThe passenger train had passed a signal at 'danger' after the driver had suffered a transient episode of amnesia, brought about by a rare medical condition. As a result, he had cancelled the AWS warnings at the signals approaching Wembley without realising.\n\nShortly after 18:00 a Freighter train, 4D62, the 16:00 from Willesden to Holyhead consisting of electric locomotive 86006, locomotive 85035 and 20 loaded Freighter vehicles was signalled from a goods line on to the Down Slow line just to the south of Wembley Central Station. The train attempted to negotiate the crossovers that led from the goods line to the Down Slow line when its eleventh wagon was struck by an eight-car electric multiple-unit passenger train, 2A85, the 17:54 from Euston to Bletchley, consisting of two 4-car Class 310 electric multiple-units. The resulting impact led to the deflection of the passenger train to its left towards the adjacent Fast lines with the remaining coaches derailed and overturned onto their sides apart from the rearmost coach.\n\nEmergency services were quickly called to the scene and arrived within twelve minutes. The resulting collision caused damage to track, signalling and overhead line equipment with the debris blocking all main lines into and out of Euston. Three passengers died, with a further seventeen passengers, including the driver of the passenger train, taken to a nearby hospital, with two detained. One detained passenger was released on 15 October and the other on 1 November.\n\nThe Down Fast line was restored at 18:22 on 12 October and later closed to traffic on 14 October to enable repairs to be completed. The Up Slow line was restored at 18:54 on 13 October and the Down Slow Line was restored on 06:00 on 15 October.\n\nA formal inquiry was ordered under the Regulation of Railways Act 1871 and was conducted by the Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways who opened the inquiry. Evidence was heard in public in London on 9 November and addressed the question of whether the freight train was moving or stationary at the moment of impact.\n\nThe investigation turned its attention to the medical board when it was discovered that the driver Ronald Armstrong (born 25 July 1921) was found to have an unusual medical history. Armstrong regularly informed the board about suffering episodes of irregular disturbed vision that occurred three to four times a year without warning. Armstrong said he did not have such an episode when driving a train although he did suffer disturbed vision while driving his car.\n\nArmstrong had also suffered from morning headaches which dated back many years which often occurred when getting up. Although the symptoms were dull, never severe and frontal in situation, he slept well but tended to wake in the early hours. He also suffered from bouts of indigestion, which was treated with bicarbonate of soda. Armstrong also suffered from panic attacks with an episode occurring before the accident. One medical condition he no longer suffered from was breathlessness and he also lost his sense of smell 18 months before the accident occurred.\n\n"}
{"id": "102848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102848", "title": "White Ship", "text": "White Ship\n\nThe White Ship (real name: , Latin documents ) was a vessel that sank in the English Channel near the Normandy coast off Barfleur, on 25 November 1120. Only one of those aboard survived. Those who drowned included William Adelin, the only legitimate son and heir of King Henry I of England, his half-sister Matilda, his half-brother Richard and also Richard d'Avranches, 2nd Earl of Chester. William Adelin's death led to a succession crisis and a period of civil war in England known as the Anarchy.\n\nThe \"White Ship\" was a newly refitted vessel captained by Thomas FitzStephen (\"Thomas filz Estienne\"), whose father Stephen FitzAirard (\"Estienne filz Airard\") had been captain of the ship \"Mora\" for William the Conqueror when he invaded England in 1066. Thomas offered his ship to Henry I of England to use it to return to England from Barfleur in Normandy. Henry had already made other arrangements, but allowed many in his retinue to take the \"White Ship,\" including his heir, William Adelin; his illegitimate son Richard of Lincoln; his illegitimate daughter Matilda FitzRoy, Countess of Perche; and many other nobles. According to chronicler Orderic Vitalis, the crew asked William Adelin for wine and he supplied it to them in great abundance. By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board although some had disembarked due to the excessive drinking before the ship sailed.\n\nThe ship's captain, Thomas FitzStephen, was ordered by the revellers to overtake the king's ship, which had already sailed. The \"White Ship\" was fast, of the best construction and had recently been fitted with new materials, which made the captain and crew confident they could reach England first. But when it set off in the dark, its port side struck a submerged rock called \"Quillebœuf\", and the ship quickly capsized. William Adelin got into a small boat and could have escaped but turned back to try to rescue his half-sister, Matilda, when he heard her cries for help. His boat was swamped by others trying to save themselves, and William drowned along with them. According to Orderic Vitalis, only two survived by clinging to the rock that night. One was Berold (Beroldus or Berout), a butcher from Rouen; the second, Godfrey, the son of Gilbert of Laigle (\"Godefroi de l'Aigle\"), eventually drowned. The chronicler further wrote that when Thomas FitzStephen came to the surface after the sinking and learned that William Adelin had not survived, he let himself drown rather than face the King.\n\nOne legend holds that the ship was doomed because priests were not allowed to board it in the customary manner. For a complete list of those who did or did not travel on the \"White Ship\", see Victims of the \"White Ship\" disaster.\n\nA direct result of William Adelin's death was the period known as the Anarchy. The \"White Ship\" disaster had left Henry I with only one legitimate child, a second daughter named Matilda. Although Henry I had forced his barons to swear an oath to support Matilda as his heir on several occasions, a woman had never ruled in England in her own right. Matilda was also unpopular because she was married to Geoffrey V, Count of Anjou, a traditional enemy of England's Norman nobles. Upon Henry's death in 1135, the English barons were reluctant to accept Matilda as queen regnant.\n\nOne of Henry I's male relatives, Stephen of Blois, the king's nephew by his sister Adela, usurped Matilda as well as his older brothers William and Theobald to become king. Stephen had allegedly planned to travel on the \"White Ship\" but had disembarked just before it sailed; Orderic Vitalis attributes this to a sudden bout of diarrhea \n\nAfter Henry I's death, Matilda and her husband Geoffrey of Anjou, the founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, launched a long and devastating war against Stephen and his allies for control of the English throne. The Anarchy dragged from 1135 to 1153 with devastating effect, especially in southern England.\n\nContemporary historian William of Malmesbury wrote: \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53672954", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53672954", "title": "Wrestling Jerusalem", "text": "Wrestling Jerusalem\n\nWrestling Jerusalem is a one-person play exploring the Israeli–Palestinian conflict as well as wider themes about identity and social division. Devised and performed by actor Aaron Davidman, it features seventeen characters of widely different backgrounds and ideological viewpoints. A fundamental emotional theme of the drama is the connected nature of sudden life experiences, with the performer describing the influence of events such as the construction of the West Bank barrier wall and American anti-Zionist demonstrations. Multiple comparisons take place beyond social divisions; an example of such a blurred moment being the move from performing a Jewish song in Hebrew to the saying of an Islamic prayer. The drama premiered in 2014 at the Intersection for the Arts complex in San Francisco, California.\n\nAaron Davidman is a Jewish-American actor who identifies as a socio-political \"progressive\", and he drew upon the occurrences during the many trips that he'd personally taken to Israel over the years. \"Wrestling Jerusalem\" takes inspiration from his attempt to emotionally comprehend the multiple perspectives that he's encountered, many of them filled with anxiety and sorrow about traumatic experiences. The Israeli–Palestinian conflict weighs heavily on the contents of the drama.\n\nThe one-person show features Davidman performing as a wide variety of individuals that vary in not just nationality but also age, occupation, religion, and other such classes, displaying highly contrasting viewpoints. The uncomfortable nature of Israeli security efforts, compared directly to features found in concentration camps, is explored as well as the horror of witnessing protesters yelling \"Death to the Jews\" in American anti-Zionist demonstrations. Life experiences between characters become blurred in several instances, such as when Davidman switches from performing a Jewish song in Hebrew to the saying of an Islamic prayer.\n\nIn one particular moment, the performer takes the role of an Israeli doctor commenting on the various sufferings that the character has witnessed. The doctor displays a disinterest in weighing what particular group of people has endured more, remarking that \"I do not compare levels of trauma\". Davidman declares, \"It is irrelevant. Trauma is trauma.\"\n\nThe play had an 'Off Broadway' run in 2016.
