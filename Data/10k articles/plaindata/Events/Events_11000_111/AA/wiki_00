These acts were repealed in full where they had no other purpose than establishing the relevant observance, and otherwise repealed only in relation to the observance.\n\nThe political and religious aspects of Anglican identity began to separate after Catholic emancipation culminated in the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. In the 1850s, moves to increased religious toleration included the Liberty of Religious Worship Act 1855 and the Jews Relief Act 1858. These changes were reflected in June and July 1858, when the House of Lords and House of Commons respectively passed resolutions making loyal addresses to Queen Victoria to remove certain \"occasional forms of prayer\" from the Book of Common Prayer. These prayers were re-specified by royal proclamation after each new monarch's accession. The Queen-in-Council agreed to consider the matter. After some delay for legal advice, on 17 January 1859 the queen issued a new proclamation removing the prayers. However, the observances which the prayers fulfilled were mandated by various Acts of Parliament; so a bill, initially called the Occasional Forms of Prayer Bill, was introduced in February 1859 to repeal the provisions which were no longer being enforced. Whereas the 1858 petitions had related only to observances in the English Book of Common Prayer, the 1859 bill additionally deleted the 23 October prayer from the Irish Book of Common Prayer. In the House of Lords the bill was renamed the \"Anniversary Days Observance Bill\". It received royal assent on 25 March.\n\nThe 1859 act was itself repealed as spent by the Statute Law Revision Act 1875.\n\nIn the House of Lords, the 1858 resolution was supported by most bishops; the Archbishop of Canterbury and bishops of London, of Oxford, and of Cashel spoke in favour, while the Bishop of Bangor opposed it. The Anglo-Catholic liturgist Vernon Staley in 1907 described the deletions as \"ultra vires\" because they were done without first obtaining the consent of the Convocations of Canterbury and York; he called them \"a distinct violation of the compact between Church and Realm, as set forth in the Act of Uniformity which imposed the Book of Common Prayer in 1662\".\n\n\n"}

The concept is Hardin’s interpretation of the closely related phenomenon known as the tragedy of the commons, and is referred to in political discourse as \"privatizing profits and socializing losses.\"\n\nThe CC–PP Game originally appeared in Hardin’s book titled \"Filters against Folly: How To Survive Despite Economists, Ecologists, and the Merely Eloquent\" which was published in 1986.\n\nPlayers of the CC–PP Game aim to commonize the costs (or externalities) generated by their activities across the wider community, while privatizing all profits (financial or otherwise) to themselves. The individual does not broadcast that they are playing the game in order to continue profiting.\n\nHardin related the CC–PP Game to ecological problems such mining, groundwater overdraft, cattle ranching and other actions that cause the depletion of natural resources or an increase in pollution.\n\nThe CC–PP Game is used to explain how individuals utilize public goods, specifically scarce natural resources. These goods include resources such as clean air, rivers, forests and groundwater. These are public goods because they are both non-excludable and non-rival. It is very difficult to assign property rights to public goods, which results in many people using the resource and the resource's subsequent depletion or the tragedy of the commons.\n\nHardin uses the original conception of the commons as a \"village pasture used for grazing sheep or cattle in preindustrial England.\" The pasture was a public space for any villager to use to grave their livestock. Villagers gained profit from each additional animal on the pasture, but did not have to pay the costs of the animals depleting the grass. The village as a whole took on the cost of overgrazing the pasture. This represented the CC–PP Game for Hardin in which the incentive to create individual profit was greater than the cost of overgrazing the field since it was spread out between many individuals.\n\nIn a more modern example of the CC–PP Game, Hardin attributes the desertification of the Sahel desert to \"unmanaged access and overuse.\"\n\nJohn D. Aram summarized the tragedy of the commons and the CC–PP Game stating, “Tragic macro effects result from a structure of micro incentives that allows unmanaged access to a fixed resource.”\n\nThe CC–PP Game is an example of a non-cooperative equilibrium or Nash Equilibrium in which the parties in the game do not cooperate and are incentivized to deplete natural resources, resulting in an inefficient outcome.\n\nThe CC–PP Game refers to the market for a scarce natural resource, for example groundwater. Groundwater is scarce because it can be extracted from the ground at a much higher rate than it can be replenished naturally. In addition, clean groundwater in many areas is limited. Groundwater is a natural resource that can be difficult to assign property rights to and is needed by all individuals.\n\nPrivate firms as well as everyday consumers will extract groundwater for their own use. Private firms gain profits from using the water to produce a good or directly selling the water. Individual consumers gain utility or satisfaction from drinking the water or using it in their homes. Both the private firm and the individual have an incentive to take water from the ground and receive a gain in utility from taking that water (privatized profits). The water supply is diminished, resulting in a tragedy of the commons and a loss of utility for everyone that uses the groundwater (communized costs). Since an individual user does not have to pay for the cost of water depletion, but is still gaining the utility or profit from using the water, the individual will continue to use the water. Every individual will come to this same conclusion and the natural resource will be depleted.\n\nThis can be seen in a pay-off matrix. Where there are two individuals making separate choices to defect by privatizing benefits and commonizing costs, or to cooperate and refrain from personal gain in order to preserve a resource. If Individual A decides to preserve water while Individual B does not then Individual A will only receive $20 while Individual B gains $80. This is true vice versa if Individual B decides to preserve water and Individual A decides to extract. Both individuals have an incentive to defect and extract water to gain $50, so as rational consumers they will extract water. However, if neither party extracted water then they would actually gain $50 more in profit. This is a case of the Prisoner’s Dilemma. However, unlike the Prisoner’s Dilemma that only has two people, CC–PP Game is an aggregate of many individuals, making it harder to see the effects of a single person’s decisions.\n\nFisheries are a prime example of the CC–PP Game. Companies gain a profit for every fish that they catch and are incentivized to continue catching fish. However, their overfishing depletes the amount of fish in the ocean, hurting the environment and other individuals. All individuals pay for the cost of a decrease in the amount of fish.\n\nMining companies participate in the CC–PP Game by depleting their worker’s health. Hardin argues that the owners of mining companies profit from their workers, while workers suffer the negative health effects of mining such as respiratory damage, chronic lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, black lung disease, and poisoning by radon gas in uranium mines. Hardin states, \"Until the development of nationalized schemes of compensation in the twentieth century the costs of deteriorated health were \"paid\" by the miner himself, partly in medical bills but even more in reduced capacity to work and enjoy life.\"\n\nHardin also included \"intangible assets\" such as “worker safety, stabilizing the cost of healthcare, and economic efficiency\" as instances of tragedy of the commons. These assets can also deteriorate if individuals choose to privatize benefits and communize costs.\n\nHardin proposed several solutions to the CC–PP Game in his books and essays.\n\nIn Hardin’s early works, he expressed his belief that they only way to protect natural resources was by limiting individual’s freedoms. He stated that preserving the commons would only be possible by “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.” Today, this would be considered command and control regulation. Hardin believed that individuals needed regulation or systems in place to force them to stop depleting resources. He rejected the option of people volunteering to not ruin common goods because of individual's lack of will power and lack of incentives to limit themselves. He believed that voluntary self-restraint was not a solution to avoiding the tragedy of the commons.\n\nHowever later in his career, Hardin argued that a strict individual responsibility could preserve the commons. He described systems of accountability for policy makers in order to preserve the commons for their constituents. This puts the responsibility for preserving the commons onto the political system.\n\nIdeally Hardin wanted all costs and benefits to be privatized. John D. Aram argues that Hardin would be in favor of a flat tax structure and elimination of public subsidies.\n\n\n"}

This attention to realism generally extends to the worn and displayed, and to behavior displayed to each other and especially to the public; indeed, many public demonstrations attempt to recreate Roman military drills, marches, and even stage mock battles.\n\nRoman reenactment groups usually welcome women and children, in an effort to both accommodate entire families and to portray Roman civilian life. Additionally, it is not unknown for older male reenactors (who might have previously played Roman legionaries) to portray consuls, senators, or even a Roman emperor. \n\nThe Roman Army did not remain static and, whilst sometimes demonstrating these changes in displays of the evolving equipment and appearance of the legionary, most groups also focus on a particular time period. The most popular period is probably the 1st-2nd century, with legionaries wearing the characteristic segmented armour illustrated on Trajan's Column. However, some groups portray the Late Roman legion, after the army reforms of Diocletian.\nA minority of groups depict the eastern continuance of the empire after the fall of Rome in the west, known popularly as the Byzantine Empire.\n\nRoman reenacting is popular in both the United States and Europe.\n\nA smaller subset of Roman reenactors attempt to recreate Roman gladiator troupes. Some of these groups are part of larger Roman reenactment groups, and others are wholly independent, though they might participate in larger demonstrations of Roman reenacting or historical reenacting in general. These groups usually focus on portraying mock gladiatorial combat in as accurate a manner as possible.\n\nGreek reenacting groups concentrate mostly on classical era hoplites, though the Archaic, Hellenistic and Mycenaean eras are becoming popular as well. Most reenactors focus on Greek hoplites and tend to depict the classical era, particularly the period around the Peloponnesian wars, but accurate depictions of Greeks in the earlier Mycenaean and other eras has becoming increasingly more common, especially the era of Persian War and reenactments of the Macedonian phalanx. Aside from groups, there are also individuals who sometimes reenact the heroes of ancient Greece.\n\nInternational conventions are now being held, with the first being in Watford, Britain in the summer of 2006.\n\nSome groups stage mock battles such as the Spartan warband that equips its members with durable aspis and other period equipment, reenacting Phalanx formation tactics to their fullest extent by depicting two hoplite squads of reenactors clashing with each other. The Spartan Army is very popular as a theme, as can be evidenced by the group called The Hellenic Warriors, who appear at museums, schools, and universities on the east coast of the United States.\n\nGreek reenacting is popular in the United States, Europe and Australia and whose members from around the world will gather at the 2010 International Ancient Greek Hoplite Festival.\n\nContinenal and insular Celts and Gauls are the subjects of some reenacting groups, with a focus on anything from tribal warfare to even domestic re-enactment of Pre-Roman Celtic societies. Many specific tribes are being re-enacted, as are important events such as battles and festivals. Typically, Celtic groups are sister groups to a Roman legion, and are sometimes created originally to portray the Roman invasion of Gaul under Julius Caesar.\n\n"}
{"id": "29441521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29441521", "title": "Control fraud", "text": "Control fraud\n\nControl fraud occurs when a trusted person in a high position of responsibility in a company, corporation, or state subverts the organization and engages in extensive fraud for personal gain. The term \"control fraud\" was coined by William K. Black to refer both to the acts of fraud and to the individuals who commit them.\n\nThe concept of control fraud is based on the observation that the CEO of a company is uniquely placed to remove the checks and balances on fraud within a company such as through the use of selective hiring and firing. These tactics can position the executive in a way that allows him or her to engage in accountancy fraud and embezzle money, hide shortfalls or otherwise defraud investors, shareholders, or the public at large. A control fraud will often obtain \"investments that have no readily ascertainable market value\", and then shop for appraisers that will assign unrealistically high values and auditing firms that will bless the fraudulent accounting statements.\n\nSome control frauds are reactive in the sense that they turn to fraud only after concluding that the business will fail. Opportunistic control frauds, by contrast, are attracted to a criminogenic environment where it is harder to detect fraud, e.g., as a result of deregulation.\n\nAn example would be when an insolvent company publishes accounts showing massive profits. This will cause the stock to rise beyond its actual value, and those exercising the control fraud will cash in their stocks before the reality is known by others. Additionally, companies can lobby for changes to weaken the law or accompanying regulation. This can be particularly effective with large campaign contributors like Charles Keating, who with other control frauds in the United States League of Savings Institutions, was able to get his own people placed on the board of the primary regulatory agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB). With the assistance of people like Speaker of the House Jim Wright and the Keating Five, he was able to convert Lincoln Savings and Loan Association into a Ponzi scheme, making millions for himself, while suppressing the investigative and regulatory functions of the FHLBB. Eventually, the Ponzi collapsed, as all Ponzis must, but with a massive cost to the taxpayers and unsecured investors. \n\nControl fraud can also occur in a political situation, for example by the leader of a country who can use their position to embezzle public funds and turn the country into a kleptocracy.\n\nExamples of control fraud include Enron, the savings and loan crisis, and Ponzi schemes such as that of Bernard Madoff.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "15905434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15905434", "title": "Credit card hijacking", "text": "Credit card hijacking\n\nCredit card hijacking is a form of credit card fraud and the term is used when a person’s credit card is used by an unauthorized person (e.g. a thief or overaggressive vendor) to buy goods or services. The credit card owner usually has trouble reasserting control over the card, because usually he or she doesn't find out immediately, and the owner must distinguish legitimate purchases from illegitimate in a credible manner.\n\nThe first form of credit card hijacking is basically identity theft, which is the deliberate use of another person's identity. Identity theft is usually the result of serious breaches of privacy and often involves the victim compromising a great deal of financial and personal information allowing the thief to charge an existing credit card account or open up new credit card accounts in the name of the victim. Methods of identity theft for credit card hijacking have involved mail interception or skimming of credit card data. The growth of online subscriptions and transactions have also brought along a variety of different phishing and the use of spyware and botnets.\n\nRadio-frequency identification RFID uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. There have been several demonstrations on how credit card fraud can committed through RFID scanners. Although the possibility of credit fraud using an RFID scanner is rare, it is possible for it to happen. There are more occurrences with credit card fraud that happen through PoS or point of sale that has been compromised with malware. The malware is typically installed by someone who hacks into the system from another location if not always, installed through hacking by. Another well known tactic for credit card fraud is the placement of skimmers on an ATM by the person or persons committing the credit fraud. \n\nAnother form of credit card hijacking is the continued charging of a person’s credit card for a subscription to goods or services no longer desired by the credit card owner. This type of credit card hijacking was pioneered by major ISPs, credit monitoring services and online dating services, are perfectly legal, and are still common today in a wide range of subscription based goods and services. Credit card hijacking of this type came about as online subscription based marketers realized that traditional subscription systems, such as the annual subscriptions that paper magazines use, were an impediment to enrolling customers. For instance, a subscription that is US$24.95 per month, is US$299.40 annually. By breaking the subscription period into small units like months or quarters, and allowing direct monthly charging of the subscriber’s credit card, the psychological and economic conflicts subscribers see are greatly reduced. \n\nThe issue which makes one subscription system a hijacking of the credit card is not how often it's billed, but the organization creating barriers that make it more difficult for subscriptions to be cancelled. Organizations which use credit card hijacking as part of their marketing strategy make online registration for the subscription easy, enforce default automatic renewal policies. In comparison to traditional subscription based system such as paper magazines where the subscriber has to periodically proactively reauthorize the subscription. Instead of an automatic renewal. The most common subscription exit barrier is to not provide any online subscription cancellation mechanism at all, but to instead require the user to cancel by telephone or by \"on-line chats\". Such organizations often add the additional barrier of making any subscription cancellation information difficult for the user to even find, thus creating an additional delay in the subscription cancellation. This is very common with internet service providers, who know the psychological barrier to making the call, which the subscriber anticipates will be unpleasant, is very high. It also allows the marketing organization to talk the subscriber into changing their minds and not cancelling the subscription. Another common subscription cancellation barrier is to have a relatively long subscription period, a no refund policy, and to require the user upon cancellation to forfeit all money covering the present subscription period. This is very common with online dating services. \n\nThis second form of credit card hijacking was created by marketers who recognized that subscription based services generally have relatively low periodic billing amounts which will generally go unnoticed on any given credit card statement. So what happens is that long after the user loses interest in the subscription, they forget to cancel the subscription and because the periodic billing is so low, they don’t tend to notice it on their credit card statement.\n\nA simple solution to this problem is to call the credit card company, request a new card with a different account number, and cancel the previous account. They will transfer the debt amount from the old account to the new account. This makes companies that have the credit card information unable to continue charging the credit card of the person. \n\nNegative option billing is the practice of sending goods automatically and billing the recipient unless the recipient is proactive in declining the goods before they are sent. Negative option billing reverses the usual direction of sales transactions. It assumes that unless you say 'no', you've agreed to have bought the goods. This is the common practice used in book clubs, record clubs, and magazine subscriptions with automatic renewal. Some practitioners of negative option billing prefer to call it \"advance consent marketing\".\n\nIf a customer cancels services provided by a vendor, the vender would be committing fraud if they bill for services not provided (for example internet access). Some venders avoid this problem by billing monthly for a \"membership\", even though no services are used by the former customer.

It features a vast array of concerts, opera, dance, drama, visual arts and roundtable discussions on science.\n\nThe \"Two Worlds\" in the name of the festival comes from Gian Carlo Menotti's intention to have the worlds of American and European culture facing each other in his event; this concept would then be strengthened by the fact that it was held in conjunction with its \"twin\", the Spoleto Festival USA held annually in May/June in Charleston, South Carolina. That twinning lasted some 15 years and, after growing disputes between the Menotti family and the board of Spoleto Festival USA, in the early 1990s a separation occurred. Under Menotti's direction in 1986, a third installment in the Spoleto Festival series was held in Melbourne, Australia. Melbourne's Spoleto Festival changed its name to the Melbourne International Festival of the Arts in 1990.\n\nFollowing Menotti's death in 2007, changes occurred in the administration with the result that the Italian Minister of Cultural Affairs appointed a new Artistic Administrator who continues to run the Festival.\n\nBecause Spoleto was a small town, where real estate and other goods and services were at the time relatively inexpensive, and also because there are two indoor theatres, a Roman theatre, and many other spaces, it was chosen by Menotti as the venue for an arts festival. It is also fairly close to Rome, with good rail connections.\n\nFollowing Menotti's death in February 2007, the city administrations of Spoleto and Charleston started talks to re-unite the two festivals, which resulted in the Mayor of Spoleto, Massimo Brunini, attending the opening ceremony of Spoleto Festival USA in May 2008.\n\nHowever, at the time of the 2007 Festival, the President and Artistic Director was Menotti's adopted son, Francis \"Chip\" Menotti and, in the fall of 2007, the Italian Minister of Cultural Affairs, Francesco Rutelli—after unsuccessful negotiations with Menotti—removed him from his position and named Giorgio Ferrara new artistic director of the festival. This has resulted in continuing controversy between representatives of the \"old\" and \"new\" managements of the Festival, as exemplified by the maintenance of a website critical of the former management, which can be seen below.\n\n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

It was organized by the newspaper \"Hürriyet\". In 1960s, most of the Turkish popular music melodies were either songs from west Europe with Turkish lyrics or traditional Turkish folk melodies played with western instruments. The goal of the contest was to encourage the development of popular Turkish music either by new compositions or by using domestic sources.\nMore formally, Hürriyet announced the goal of the contest as \"Redirecting Turkish music using technique and style of the western music as well as the instruments of the western music\" \n\nAltın Mikrofon was a milestone in Turkish music. Although Hürriyet gave up organizing the contest after 1968, two other newspapers tried to continue: \"Günaydın\" in 1972 and Saklambaç in 1979. But these later contests unlike the earlier contests, didn’t attracted much attention and they too gave up. The results of these were as follows:\n\n"}

The musical ran on Broadway in 1979.\n\n\"I Remember Mama\" originated as a memoir by Kathryn Forbes titled \"Mama's Bank Account\". It was adapted for the stage by John Van Druten as a play, which ran on Broadway from 1944 to 1946. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II were the producers. It was filmed in 1948, and served as the basis for a 1950s television series, titled \"Mama\". Every incarnation basically was the same, a series of heartwarming vignettes centering on a family of Norwegian immigrants living in San Francisco in the early 20th Century. At its core is the oldest daughter, Katrin, who yearns to be a published writer and conspires to meet renowned author Dame Sybil Fitzgibbons, a guest at the Fairmont Hotel, for professional advice and guidance. It is through Katrin's eyes the struggles, hopes, and dreams of the Hansens unfold.\n\nThe musical adaptation was beset with problems from the beginning. Rodgers and Charnin had composed a full score before the libretto was written, so they ended up having to replace a significant number of songs throughout rehearsals. The original director, Charnin, was replaced by Cy Feuer after tryouts in Philadelphia, with producer Alexander H. Cohen saying \"they had to go 'for radical surgery' \". The original choreographer, Graciela Daniele, was replaced by Danny Daniels.\n\nThe musical, produced by Alexander H. Cohen and Hildy Parks opened on Broadway on May 31, 1979 at the Majestic Theatre, where it closed on September 2 after 108 performances and 40 previews. Directed by Cy Feuer, the opening cast featured Liv Ullmann, George Hearn, Dolores Wilson, and George S. Irving.\nThe spectacular and clever set was designed by the late David Mitchell (of \"Annie\" fame).\n\nBy 1979, Broadway audiences had become accustomed to edgier musicals such as \"Sweeney Todd\" and \"Evita\". Critics found \"Mama\" to be old-fashioned and corny, and all were quick to describe the musically disinclined Ullmann as miscast. \"The New York Times\" reviewer wrote: \"At the end of its much-postponed and choppy progress...this big and expensive musical had buried most of the strengths it possesses under a mass of cliches and a pervading, forced cuteness... Miss Ullman is unsuited to it.\"\n\nShow business insiders dubbed the Rodgers' production \"I Dismembered Mama.\" A different musical version starring Celeste Holm played several regional theaters and was better received by audiences and reviewers alike but was prevented from coming to New York.\n\nAdvance box office sales, particularly for matinée performances, had been strong enough to keep the show alive in its early weeks, but attendance quickly dropped in numbers dramatic enough to warrant closing. It was Rodgers' last musical.\n\nAn original cast album was never recorded, but a studio recording with Hearn and Irving reprising their stage roles and Sally Ann Howes replacing Ullmann was released in 1985.\n\nThe first Canadian production of the musical came in 2004. Produced by the Toronto Civic Light Opera Company, the production was designed and directed by Joe Cascone. Starring Caroline Moro-Dalicandro as Mama, David Haines as Papa, Larry Westlake as Uncle Chris and Andrea Strayer as Katrin. This production took a few minor liberties with the script and score, but was a very big success for the company. The show ran over the Christmas season and garnered rave reviews and tremendous audience reception. Quoted one member of the original Broadway production staff, \"The show is a hit at last!\"\n\n\n"}

It dates back to the 16th century.\n\nIn Europe, beginning in the 15th century, people fasted as a way of remembering famines, plagues and wars. The Swiss Federal Diets of 1480 and 1483 talked about national Fast Days of penitence and thanksgiving but in the end, left these to the cantons. With no federal law, fast days became pilgrimages, processions, litanies and fasts.\n\nIn 1522 Huldrych Zwingli, who helped stir Protestant Reformation in Switzerland, said fasting laws were only human notions which had nothing to do with the Holy Writ. Nonetheless, the plagues of Basle (1541) and Berne (1565 and 1577) were followed by days of penitence and fasting, asking God for clemency and mercy.\n\nGeneva was a cradle of Protestantism and the Reformation. There was a Geneva-wide fast in the beginning of October 1567 as a sign of friendship with Protestants undergoing persecution in Lyon, France and this was most likely the first \"Jeûne genevois\" (Genevan fast). Five years later, news of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and the slaughter of several thousand Huguenots beginning on 24 August 1572 triggered a fast throughout Geneva on the following 3 September, which could be why the date of later yearly fasts was shifted back by almost a month.\n\nBy 1640, through sway of the reformed cantons, the fast had become yearly and was carried on even after the Genevan revolution of 1792. \"Jeûne genevois\" later became a patriotic holiday, symbolizing both Geneva's proud identity and its Protestantism. By the beginning of the Helvetic Republic folklore had thoroughly linked \"Jeûne genevois\" with the widely remembered St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and fasting in Geneva as the slaughter of whole Protestant families carried on throughout France.\n\nIn 1831 the Federal Diet decreed a \"Jeûne Fédéral\" (federal fast) for all cantons, fixing the date at 8 September. This was later made the third Sunday in September but for Geneva, which fixed the day of its own \"Jeûne genevois\".\n\nIn 1869 Geneva decreed that the holiday was no longer official, but \"Jeûne genevois\" was celebrated unofficially until 1965, slowly losing its religious significance. On 1 August 1966 it was again declared a public holiday and the date fixed as the Thursday following the first Sunday of September.\n\nThe religious fasting of \"Jeûne genevois\" is not widely followed. Banks and post offices along with many shops, restaurants and bars close for the day. However, unlike Thanksgiving in the U.S., which also falls on a Thursday, a four-day weekend is not usually taken and most businesses are open on Friday.\n\nPlum pie(\"tarte aux pruneaux\") is often served as dessert in Geneva homes on \"Jeûne genevois\". Any knowledge as to how this tradition began seems to have been lost, although it may have come about as a means to allow women and housekeepers a way to spend the day in prayer, having cooked plum pies the day before (area plums being in season), with these plum pies the only food eaten in many Geneva households on \"Jeûne genevois\".\n\n \n"}

He was an anti-war activist from 1991, and remained a prominent speaker until late in his life.\n\nHarada was born in the village of Asajawa in Nagano Prefecture on 11 August 1916. After completing school, he joined the Imperial Japanese Navy's naval infantry force in 1933, aged 17. He later transferred to the Navy's aviation branch, and graduated first in the 35th pilot training class in February 1937. Harada was posted to China in October that year during the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not involved in any aerial combat. While in China he witnessed Japanese military personnel indiscriminately killing Chinese civilians in the mistaken belief that they were soldiers in disguise. In December he took part in the strike on the which led to increased tensions with the United States. Harada was sent back to Japan in January 1938, and subsequently served in several training positions.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Pacific War, Harada was a Mitsubishi A6M Zero pilot assigned to the aircraft carrier \"Sōryū\", which formed part of the 1st Air Fleet. In this role, he took part in the 1st Air Fleet's series of operations during the initial months of the war. On 7 December 1941, he flew protective patrols over the fleet during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and did not see any combat. Harada also escorted the aircraft which attacked the Australian port of Darwin on 19 February 1942. During the Indian Ocean raid, he was confirmed to have shot down three British fighters over Colombo on 5 April, and claimed another two as \"probables\". Four days later, he downed two British Bristol Blenheim light bombers which were attempting to attack the Japanese fleet.\n\nDuring the Battle of Midway, Harada shot down either three or five American aircraft. He landed on the last surviving Japanese aircraft carrier, \"Hiryū\", after \"Sōryū\" was sunk by United States aircraft. Harada was in the air at the time of \"Hiryū\"s sinking later in the battle, and was rescued by a warship after ditching into the sea.\n\nIn July 1942, Harada was reassigned to the aircraft carrier \"Hiyō\". In early October of that year, the carrier departed Japan to take part in the Guadalcanal Campaign. On 17 October, Harada formed part of the escort for a force of torpedo bombers which were attempting to attack targets on Guadalcanal. American Grumman F4F Wildcats attacked this force, and while Harada probably downed a Wildcat, his aircraft was badly damaged. His plane crash-landed near the Japanese base at Rekata Bay on Santa Isabel Island, and Harada had to dig himself out from underneath the wreckage of his plane with his bare hands. Harada was later returned to Japan on board a hospital ship.\n\nOne of Harada's arms was badly injured in the crash, which ended his career as a combat pilot. He subsequently served as a flying instructor, and late in the war trained Kamikaze pilots. By the end of hostilities, he held the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) and had flown for 8,000 hours. The number of aircraft Harada is credited with shooting down differs among sources; in 2011 Ikuhiko Hata, Yasuho Izawa and Christopher Shores wrote that he \"was credited with nine confirmed victories\", while a 2015 \"New York Times\" article states that he downed 19 Allied aircraft.\n\nFollowing World War II, Harada initially worked as a dairy farmer, but suffered from nightmares in which he saw the faces of the American airmen he had downed during the war. In 1965, he founded a nursery for children with his wife after she asked him \"if you want to atone for the lives you have taken, what better way is there than to nurture new lives?\" The couple opened a kindergarten in 1969. He continued as a principal of the kindergarten until his retirement. In a 2013 interview with \"The Australian\" Harada said:\n\nThe first incarnation of my life was as a ruthless killer. I still live with a sense of sin over those I killed. I chased them and shot them down—such a horrible thing to do. Now, I go to the kindergarten every day and interact with the children. I want to nurture kind and considerate hearts in all of them. Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who is believed to have been the pilot who shot down his plane. As part of his travels Harada visited Santa Isabel Island, where he located the wreckage of his fighter and brought a section of it back to Japan.\n\nHarada was an anti-war activist from 1991. He began giving public talks about his combat experiences and the need to avoid wars that year after overhearing young Japanese discussing the bombing which took place during the Gulf War as if it formed part of a video game. In 2015, \"The New York Times\" reported that Harada, aged 98, was a \"highly sought-after public speaker\", who was motivated by a desire to pass on his experiences as a warning to the current generations of Japanese who he believed were unaware of the nature of warfare. He opposed efforts by conservative members of the Japanese government to change the country's pacifist constitution, saying that \"these politicians were born after the war, and so they don’t understand it must be avoided at all costs. In this respect, they are like our prewar leaders\". A documentary named \"Each and Every Battlefield\" covering Harada's life was released in Japan in March 2015.\n\nHarada died in Nagano on 3 May 2016. He was believed to have been the last surviving Japanese combat pilot who had taken part in the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n"}

LANcouver is a \"BYOC\" (Bring Your Own Computer) event, which means that everyone attending brings their own PC desktop or laptop. Network resources (such as switches and network cable) and power connections are supplied and connected by the administrators on-site during the event, who also host the various servers required for playing LAN based games such as Team Fortress 2, , and Unreal Tournament. LANcouver organizers have also been responsible for running tournaments at other events such as GottaCon 2012.\n\nLANcouver 6 was a registered World Cyber Games qualifying event, and hosted qualifying tournaments for the national championships.

In early 2011, that year's LANcouver event was announced, making it the first time that a year was given to the title rather than a number. LANcouver 2011 was the 7th event and was planned to be much larger than all previous events, while also incorporating other game types not played on computers such as Xbox 360 tournaments, Warhammer 40,000 events, and and other TCG (trading card game) events.\nLANcouver 2011 was held at the Great Northern Way Campus; another first for the event is that it was hosted in the City of Vancouver proper and not a suburb.\n\nThe main PC gaming events for LANcouver 2011 were , and League of Legends. Console events were held as well, with the following main tournaments: Marvel vs Capcom 3, & Super Smash Bros.

Sponsors included ASUS (Presenting), NCIX (Retail Sponsor), Kingston Technology, Antec, Shaw Cablesystems, Compu2000, ROCCAT, and more.\n\nThe event was host to three major tournaments: League of Legends (5v5), StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty (1v1) and Counter-Strike Global Offensive (5v5). The top Canadian StarCraft II player received a trip to Toronto for 2012's World Championship Series qualifier, and competed to win a spot on Team Canada for the World Finals later that year, in addition to a top-end ASUS gaming notebook.\n\nAttendance was approximately 175 out of 200 BYOC spots, and over 150 spectators attended throughout the weekend.\n\nIn March 2013, LANcouver organizers revealed that the 9th event would be held at the NCIX Warehouse in Richmond, BC, and that the event would also be title sponsored by NCIX. The departure from the Richmond Olympic Oval allows for several key factors from 2012 to be addressed, such as the lack of darkness during nighttime hours. It was also announced that NCIX would be holding a Warehouse Sale simultaneously, with early ticket purchasers for LANcouver getting early access to the NCIX sale.\n\nTournaments in 2013 included League of Legends, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, StarCraft, and others. New for 2013 were VIP seats, advertised as being in a \"special seating area\" and with features like privacy curtains, reduced noise, better seating and complementary refreshments. Other new features included a live broadcast of the LANcouver University panel sessions, improved networking, and an increase in prizing for the entire event. Nvidia's Shield Portable handheld gaming system had its Western Canada debut at LANcouver, and attendees were able to try the new system before it went on sale.\n\nIn April 2014, rumours surfaced that LANcouver organizers had been planning a special 10th anniversary for 2014. The event would also be the 10th since founding. Speculations included a 350-seat BYOC, multi-genre gaming, console tournament, or even live finals for a major international eSports event. In late 2014 it was revealed that LANcouver would miss out on hosting an event for that year, with a followup to be provided in 2015. In Spring of 2015 it was revealed that a 10th LANcouver event is in full planning for late 2015. Several reasons were given for the lack of an event in 2014, mainly concerning the organizer's personal schedule (LANcouver is run by one person) as well as difficulty securing an adequate venue within budget requirements.\n\n"}

He is an ancestor of one branch of the Lee (or Rhee) family today in both South and North Korea. \n\nLý was born in 1174, the seventh son of Emperor Lý Anh Tông (who reigned from 1138–75) and his consort Le My Nga. He was appointed the Great National Tutor.\n\nIn 1225, Trần Thủ Độ overthrew the Lý Dynasty by introducing his nephew Trần Cảnh to the imperial court to serve the incumbent Empress Lý Chiêu Hoàng, he then orchestrated a political marriage between Trần Cảnh and Lý Chiêu Hoàng and thereafter forced Lý Chiêu Hoàng to abdicate in favour of her husband Trần Cảnh. This marked the end of the Lý Dynasty and the beginning of the Trần Dynasty. With the Trần family having just gained the throne, Trần Thủ Độ ordered the massacre of the Lý family members and forced all of its descendants to change their surname to Nguyen, and sent them to the northern mountainous areas.\n\nIn 1226, (Kien Trung's year of the Second Trần Dynasty of Thai Tong), in order to avoid further bloodshed by the Trần family, Lý Long Tường, together with 6000 mandarins and servants departed from the Than Phu (now Thanh Hóa Province) estuary and fled to the South China Sea in three large ships. They carried relics with them, including the imperial crown, imperial costumes, and the heaven imperial sword (). After a month on the high seas, they were forced to land in Taiwan due to a typhoon. When Lý Long Tường decided to leave, his son Ly Long Hien was severely ill and had to stay in Taiwan together with 200 mandarins, followers and servants. Lý Long Tường continued northwards to Ongjin County and then on to Haeju, Hwanghae in the Yellow Sea. Legend has it that the Korean king Kojong of the Goryeo Dynasty (1192–1259) had dreamt of a grand phoenix flying from the south and landing in his nation. Therefore, he ordered the local government of Hae-ju to give the Vietnamese royal refugees a red-carpeted welcome and allow them to live in a manor in his country.\n\nLý Long Tường and his companions started their culture of fishing and breeding. He also opened a school for literature (poetry, rhythmical prose and worship rituals) and a school to teach martial arts - the art of war. Thousands of local students joined his two schools.\n\nIn 1232, an army of the Mongol Empire led by General Sartai launched an attack on Korea by both sea and land. The troops, using the waterways, attacked Hwang-hae but were defeated by the army and the local inhabitants led by Ly Long Tuong. Ly Long Tuong always rode a white horse and as a result, was dubbed the \"White Horse General.\"\n\nIn 1253, the Mongol army led by the great Khan Möngke launched a second attack on Korea. The Yuan-Mongol army, led by Tang Ji, attacked Hwang-hae overland and by using the waterways. Lý Long Tường, although by then over 70 years old, led the army and the local inhabitants to victory after a five-month campaign. As a result of this important triumph, the Korean king renamed Jin-san () Hwa-san () and appointed Ly Long Tuong Hwa-san gun (花山君). The location of the Mongol army surrender was called the Gate of Surrender Acceptance (; \"Su-hang-mun\"). The Korean king also had a pillar erected here to honour Ly Long Tuong. (The pillar can still be seen today).\n\nWhen Lý Long Tường died, he was buried at the foot of Mount Di A near Panmunjeom (). The mountain peak (Kwang-dea) where Lý Long Tường always sat to look southwards and cried is now called the \"Peak of Nostalgia\" ().\n\nToday, there are some 1500 households in North Korea and 600 in South Korea with connections to Lý Long Tường. A descendant of Lý Long Tường, Lee Chang Kun (Ly Xuong Can), and Ly Sang Joon (Ly Tung Tuan, the Founder of Golden Bridge Finance Group) visits Lý's temple in Dinh Bang village in Bắc Ninh Province every year with his family living and sends money to help in the reconstruction of the temple. He has also invested in local projects and together with this family took up Vietnamese citizenship in 2010. His son born in 1997 was named Ly Viet Quoc. At the end of 1995, a report on Lý Long Tường was broadcast by South Korean TV channel KBS.\n\nAlso, Lý Long Tường is the founder of one of the Korean clan, Hwasan Lee clan.\n\n"}

It began as a nod to the Capital's expanding cityscape, populated by young families with links across the globe, and blossomed throughout the 1990s and early 2000s to an event reflecting the more than 170 unique nationalities that comprise our population. The festival has become one of the most successful multicultural festivals in Australia. The festival is held over three days during February each year. \n\nThe Festival is supported by the ACT Government and is administered by the Community Participation Group, Multicultural Affairs, a division of the ACT Government Community Services Directorate.\n\nIn 1981, the ACT Ethnic Communities Council held the first festival celebrating cultural diversity, a one-day event in Civic to celebrate Australia Day. By 1988, the festival had grown to host about 40 international food stalls, music and dancing. That year it was held in the Civic end of Ainslie Avenue, and along London Circuit in front of Civic Square, and also included a parade led by Chinese lion dancers.\n\nIn 1997, the newly established ACT Office of Multicultural Affairs staged the first week-long Festival as a means of celebrating Canberra and Australia's cultural diversity. In 2010, the Festival became a three-day event and remains that duration.\n\nIn 2012, the festival hosted a record 350 stalls. The 2012 festival was also the first to allow cultural kava use, as a trial. The ACT Government announced in 2013 that the kava trial had been a success and there would be a permanent lifting of the ban on the drink at the National Multicultural Festival.\n\nThe \"Out In Canberra\" People's Choice Awards in 2013 named the National Multicultural Festival Favourite Attraction and Event.\n\nWeather at the festival is usually hot and dry, with organisers handing out 18,000 bottles of water to patrons at the 2014 festival.\n\nThe festival has grown over time to become one of the most successful multicultural festivals in Australia. The 2014 event reportedly injected $5 million into the ACT economy and contributed to an additional 10,000 overnight stays in Canberra by interstate and international visitors.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2009, the Fringe Festival was a free event forming part of the Multicultural Festival. In 2009, then Minister for Multicultural Affairs John Hargreaves announced that the Multicultural Festival would be reduced to a three-day event and the Fringe Festival moved to become a part of the National Folk Festival.\n\nThe 2013 National Multicultural Festival was the first to take place in conjunction with a fringe festival since 2009. The 2013 Fringe ran for just one night; its budget was allocated from ACT Government arts funding on a competitive basis.\n\nIn 2014 the Fringe Festival continued; that year, the Fringe Festival was directed by Jorian Gardner, who the ACT Arts and Multicultural Affairs Minister Joy Burch selected for the position without a competitive selection process.\nJorian Gardner hosted, among other performances, a Hitler-themed burlesque strip-tease featuring a female dancer dressed as Hitler with gold wings performing to the song \"Gangnam Style\". The performance attracted significant controversy, with ACT Opposition Leader Jeremy Hanson calling for Arts and Multicultural Minister Joy Burch to resign or be sacked for hiring the man who oversaw the performance, and opposition multicultural affairs spokesperson Giulia Jones labeling the performance offensive and racist.\n\n"}

Those supporting Israel generally also expressed concern for the loss of life and injuries to civilians. Criticism included the death and injuries of civilians, the disproportionate response, and the execution of the raid.\n\n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was in Canada during the incident, expressed regret for the loss of life, and said that the event represents a clear case of self-defense of the IDF soldiers, he expressed his \"full backing\" for the military raid and cancelled a scheduled trip to the United States to meet with U.S. President Barack Obama. A spokesman for the Prime Minister was quoted as saying that Netanyahu, \"feels he has to be home to deal with this\". he told a press conference that had Israel not stopped the flotilla from breaking the blockade and entering the Gaza Strip illegally, hundreds of more flotillas would arrive carrying weapons. He stood his ground defending the raid and said Israel will never apologize for the incident. In an address to the country, on 2 June he said \"Israel faces hypocrisy and a biased rush to judgment.\" He further noted that in five of the six vessels in the flotilla, the boarding procedure ended without casualties. \"The only difference was with one ship, where extremist Islamic activists, supporters of terrorism, waited for our troops on the deck with axes and knives.\"\n\nAfter the boarding took place, Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said that the flotilla of ships \"was an armada of hate and violence\". He added that the flotilla attempt to reach Gaza was \"a premeditated and outrageous provocation\" and claimed that its organizers had ties not only to Hamas, but also to global Jihad, and al Qaida.\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman called the international community \"two faced\" and said Israel was being condemned for its military acts of defense. Lieberman was said to have been \"reminding\" the UN Secretary General that in the past month alone over 500 people were killed in various incidents in Thailand, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq and India, which had allegedly been \"ignored\" while Israel was being condemned for its \"unmistakably defensive actions\". Israel later rescinded its criticism of India.\n\nOpposition leader Tzipi Livni said that the coalition and the opposition are united in support of the defense forces, and that she is ready to assist the government in the political and explanatory aspects of the flotilla incident. She, however, disagreed with what she considered Netanyahu's lack of policy: \"The world is certainly hypocritical, but that doesn't absolve us from forming a policy. This is more than an isolated incident. Anything that happened when Israel had a different standing in world opinion would have had a different result. Now, any isolated incident becomes a global drama, and it's becoming worse. We are reaching the stage when Israel's ability to defend itself will no longer exist.\" She said the lack of policy in the aftermath of the incident would jeopardize Israel's legitimacy and backing from the international community, which she says for years had insisted on not recognizing Hamas until it recognizes Israel and accepts past agreements, and had accepted the closure of Gaza while \"it was clear that Israel wanted an agreement with pragmatic forces, with the legitimate Palestinian government.\" She also said that IDF soldiers acted appropriately, and supports setting up an internal investigation committee with the United States.\n\nAmbassador to the U.K., Ron Prosor, said: \"It's obvious – and I won't beat around the bush on this – that this wasn't successful and I think it clearly took up an issue that should have been solved differently.\" [However, the] other side [behaved] appallingly. [Israel was in a] war situation with terrorists. The loss of life was tragic and I’m not just saying that. When you look at the footage ... it's obvious that the reaction is self—defence to try and save your life.\"\n\nThe Israeli high court rejected a petition seeking to overrule Attorney-General Yehuda Weinstein's decision to halt the police investigation into the attack. On 3 June, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the soldiers responded in self-defense, and that the Gaza blockade and the raid of the ships were legal.\n\nMinister of Strategic Affairs Moshe Ya'alon, a former IDF chief of staff, announced that the operation was a failure and instead of distributing citations Israel was busy trying to understand why basic operating protocol was not implemented.\n\n Turkish Deputy Prime Minister, Bülent Arınç said \"In the name of the Turkish people and of our government, we strongly condemn these attacks,\" and he announced that Turkey canceled an U-19 football game against Israel. He added that no one should think that Turkey would declare war on Israel.\n\nPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that the raid was \"state terror\" and decided to return from a state visit to Chile. Erdoğan spoke to the AKP Group at the Turkish Parliament, he said \"Turkey's friendship is as strong as its animosity.\" He also strongly rebuked Israel's action saying even pirates had a code of conduct. Erdoğan upped the ante, in a speech to legislators saying Israel should be \"punished\" for its \"bloody massacre\" amid a warning that no one should test Turkey's patience. He said \"It is no longer possible to cover up or ignore Israel's lawlessness. The international community must from now on say 'enough is enough'. Dry statements of condemnation are not enough ... There should be results.\" He said the Israeli action was an attack \"on international law, [and] the conscience of humanity and world peace\". He even said that Israel acts as it does because it has powerful friends. He called for Israel to lift the \"inhuman siege\" of the Gaza Strip, which he referred to as an \"open-air prison\", and announced that he was considering sending the Turkish Navy to escort any future flotillas or to visit Gaza himself, in order to break the blockade. He also urged the international community to impose sanctions on Israel.\n\nPresident Abdullah Gül said, \"From now on, Turkish-Israeli ties will never be the same. This incident has left an irreperable and deep scar.\" He also said, \"Turkey will never forgive this attack.\" Gül compared Israel's actions to those of al-Qaeda, and demanded that Israel apologize and pay compensation, and also urged Israel to thoroughly investigate the incident and lift the blockade of Gaza.\nA Turkish Foreign Ministry statement condemned Israel, and the foreign ministry was reported to have summoned the Israeli ambassador to lodge a protest. Turkey recalled its ambassador from Israel. Foreign Minister, Ahmet Davutoğlu told the UN Security Council that Israel has \"lost all legitimacy\" as a result of the raid. He called those who died \"martyrs\". He said, \"It is no longer possible to cover up or ignore Israel's lawlessness. It is time for the international community to say 'enough is enough'.\" He also said that Turkey was ready to normalise ties if the blockade on Gaza was lifted because \"it was time calm replaces anger.\" That, in turn, was accompanied with statement saying the injured would stay in Tel Aviv hospital under the care of a Turkish doctor, \"We will not leave them (the wounded) to the mercy of anyone.\" The Parliament of Turkey unanimously adopted a resolution calling for the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on Israel, and called the attack a \"blatant violation of the UN Charter and international law\".\n\nİlker Başbuğ, Chief of the Turkish Armed Forces held a phone conversation with Gabi Ashkenazi, the Israeli Chief of Staff and called the raid unacceptable and indicated such actions could hold very serious consequences. Turkey said that all future aid vessels would be escorted by the Turkish Navy.\n\nLeaders of opposition parties in Turkey also condemned the raid on Turkish ships. The leader of MHP, Devlet Bahçeli, said the attack was an aggression that should be never accepted by the Turkish nation.\n\nKemal Kılıçdaroğlu, chairman of the Republican People's Party (CHP), supported Turkish government's efforts for a UN Security Council resolution to condemn Israeli government and he said \"We said we have given our support to the prime minister, as he said the attacks would not be left without a response. We said the CHP would support solutions which are concordant with our national interests.\" However, he also criticized the Turkish government and told Turkish television, \"The European Union and the United States consider Hamas a terror organization. We must be careful.\" He demanded that the government release communications with Israel prior to the incident, suggesting it allowed the flotilla to proceed despite knowing that violence was likely. Erdogan dismissed Kılıçdaroğlu as an Israeli \"advocate\" after Kılıçdaroğlu recited Torah's the eighth commandment, which says 'Do not steal' and the ninth commandment says 'Do not lie'.\n\n called an emergency meeting on 1 June to discuss what it called Israel's \"terrorist act\" against the flotilla. Secretary General of the Arab League, Amr Moussa, stated, \"we condemn this crime, taken against a humanitarian mission and people. They were trying to help people. They were not on a military mission. Everyone should condemn this.\"\n\n\nIn a joint-statement, Syrian President Bashar al—Assad and Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri \"condemn[ed] the heinous crime committed by Israel through the brutal attacks on unarmed civilians on board the Freedom Flotilla\". While warning that Israel's \"violations of basic humanitarian norms and international laws threatens to plunge the Middle East into a war which will not only affect the region\". After reconfirming bonds with Turkey and harshly criticizing the Israeli siege, al-Assad joint Ergodan in proposing a new initiative aimed at having the blockade on Gaza lifted \"once and for all\". His plan involved \"a number of political ideas for regional and international activity aimed at lifting the siege\". Qatar is slated to take part in the initiative's implementation. At the conference, Erdogan urged Arab nations to unite and step-up efforts to end Israel's blockade on the Gaza Strip. He said \"Are we going to remain silent over the murder of nine people? We can't\nturn a blind eye to this banditry in international waters. This can't continue as it is. Peace and stability will not come to the region as long as the blockade of Gaza persists. Painful experience has made it clear that no [regional] country will fully achieve prosperity and security as long as the Palestinian-Israeli conflict remains unresolved.\"\n\n\nThe Secretary General of the Organization of American States said \"Nothing can justify excessive use of military force to attack, with serious loss of human lives, to a disarmed civil convoy.\" Also he warned of a violence increase risk in the Middle East, Mr. José Miguel Insulza asked \"to avoid actions which can means to increase the situation that, once again, threatens seriously the peace process in the Middle East\".\n\n\n\nA summit at the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia a statement agreed to by 21 of the 22 participants at the conference (Israel being the 22nd) read \"All member states, except one, expressed their grave concern and condemnation for the actions undertaken by the Israeli Defence Forces.\" In response Turkish President Abdullah Gul said the near-unanimous condemnation showed Israel was isolated and that it \"will suffer the consequences for its mistake against Turkey\".\n\nThe President of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek called it \"an unjustified attack\" and said, \"it is a clear and unacceptable breach of international law, especially the fourth Geneva Convention. We demand that Israel explain its actions immediately, with the utmost transparency, and guarantee full accountability by co-operating with any full inquiry that is to be set up.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The priest of the temple, while taking procession between the fort and temple three times in the evening, hangs from the tip of the long, lean wooden stick (measuring 60 feet), raised high into the sky. The priest possessed by the goddess would himself tell a few days before, where this \"manu\" is available; from there only, this has to be procured. Hanging from the upper end of the stick, which is raised high into the sky, is a very risky exercise, but the grace of the Goddess, it is believed, saves the priest from falling. It is organized in the month of September or October (Dasara) of every year. It is a stupendous event attended by two to three lakhs of people from the neighboring towns and villages. The Rajas of Vizianagaram would be overseeing this event. The APSRTC runs about 250 buses from different parts of the state to facilitate transport of devotees to Vizianagram to attend this festival.\n\nIt was during 1757, when the king Puspati Peda Vijaya Rama Raju of Vizianagaram was busy in the Battle of Bobbili, second Anand has taken the charge of crown and died in the year 1760. His wife also died along with him in Sati (practice). Then the wife of Peda Vijaya Rama Raju, Rani Chandrayamma has adopted Vijaya Rama Raju who belongs to Vizianagaram dynasty as per history.\n\nIf we go through the history of 104 temples constructed by Vizianagar Sanstan some history of those temples can be known by virtue of their location. But there is no specific history about the Sri Pydithalli Ammavaru temple constructed by this sanstan. But as per rumours or by some stories it is seen that Pydithalli Ammavaru is a Grama Devata of Vizianagaram. Some say that this Ammavaru is a sister of Maharanis of Vizianagaram. But there are many evidences that Pydithalli Ammvaru belongs to Vizianagaram dynasty. Even though there are no perfect proofs regarding birth and other details of Pydimamba, as per the peoples saying, after completion of Bobbili battle after Vijayadasimi on the next Tuesday and idol was found in the west side of Pedda Cheruvu of Vizianagaram. It is known Pyidimamaba, the village goddess of Vizianagaram.\n\nIt was in 1750 when the French leader Marquis de Bussy-Castelnau was staying with entire battalion near Hyderabad. Many soldiers have died due to some disease (Masuchi). He was running with financial crisis. Peda Vijaya Rama Raju of Vizianagaram helped him to overcome financial crisis and rebuild his battalion. In 1756 Bussy visited Rajahmundry. It is heard that Vijaya Rama Raju has given a warm welcome to Bussy by going in front at Rajahmundry.\n\nAt that time Bobbili Maharajas were ruling with full power. There are some differences between Bobbili Maharajas and Vizianagaram Rajas regarding power. Because of those differences and some reasons Battle of Bobbili started in 23 January 1757. During the battle entire Bobbili fort got destroyed and many Bobbili soldiers died in the battle. The wife of Vijaya Rama Raju and Sister Sri. Pydimamba tried to stop the battle by hearing the news and were not succeeded. By that time only Sri Pydimamba sister of Vijayaramaraju was suffering from Masuchi disease. While she was in the puja of Goddess she came to know that Vijayaramaraju is in trouble. She wanted to inform her brother regarding this and tried to convey the message through Vizianagaram soldiers, but every one was in the battle. She started with Patiwada Appalanaidu to convey the message in a horse cart. But, by that time, she got the news that his brother Vijaya Rama Raju died in the hands of TandrapapaRayudu. She felt unconscious. Patiwada Applanaidu sprinkled water over her face and she came to conscious stage and told Appalanaidu that she will not live more. She is going to engross her soul in Goddess. Her statue will be found at the west bank of Pedda Cheruvu (A pond located at the heart of Vizianagaram lies on the west side of Vizianagaram Fort). The fishermen found the idol of Pydimamba and constructed a temple called Vanam Gudi for goddess, at Vizianagaram Railway Station which was the first temple for Pydimamba, the second temple is located at three lamps junction.\n\nEvery year on the first Tuesday passing Vijayadasami Sirimanu Utsav is being celebrated. Sirimanu means a big tree. It is believed that approximately 15 days before\n\nof Sirimanu Utsav goddess Pydimamba would come in the dream of temple Pujari and tell him where the Sirimanu for this year is located. Pujari would go in search of sirimanu and will cut the sirimanu with performing puja etc. That sirimanu can be located anywhere. The owner must agree to cut his tree for Utsav. That tree will be shaped neatly into Sirimanu and will be placed over the chariot. This sirimanu will be brought to Three Lanters junction around 2:00 pm. At around temple Pujari will make darshan of Goddess and will sit on the Sirimanu chariot. This sirimanu will move 3 times to Vizianagaram fort and temple between 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm. The Vizianagaram rajahs will sit on the top of the fort and watch the Utsav. Pujari will be given new clothes by Rajas and puja is performed. In front of Srimanu there will be a chariot in the shape of White elephant.\n\nMany people do not know about the White Elephant moving in front of Sirimanu chariot. But in the olden days Maharajas used to sit on a white elephant and participate in Sirimanu Utsav. Now as per the present situation white elephant statue is being moved in front of Sirimanu as a part of tradition.\n\nSri Pydimamba died before getting married. So five Married women were made sit on the Anjali chariot which is on the front of Sirimanu as a part of tradition. As five married women are sitting on this chariot, this is called Anjali chariot. Secondly along with this sirimanu Paladhara, an umbrella made with fishing nets decorated with flowers and fruits is important.\n\nAs per history when Goddess statue will be found in west side of pedda cheruvu, Patiwda Appalanaidu has tried to bring the statue out by calling professional swimmers of Yata Veedhi. They agreed to bring the statue out with out taking money on putting a condition that their people will participate with srimanu utasav with umbrella made of fishing nets. Patiwada Appalanaidu agreed to their condition and made the rajas convinced for allowing them to participate in Sirimanothsavam.\n\n\n"}

He became a captain and regimental supply officer in October, and subsequently, with the rank of major, commanded the 2nd Battalion from January to May 1918, Company F from May to July, and finally the 1st Battalion from July 1918.\n\nFarrell participated in the Battle of Cantigny, the Aisne-Marne Offensive, the Battle of Montdidier-Noyon and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. The 1st Engineers' main role was maintenance of the roads and construction of bridges in the 1st Division area, although detachments also employed Bangalore torpedoes to clear paths through barbed wire. However, during the Argonne battle, Farrell's 1st Battalion was committed to the line as infantry. For his leadership in the action that followed, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. His citation read:\n\nFarrell was also awarded the Croix de guerre with palm for his actions, and the 1st Battalion received a citation from Major General Charles Summerall, the commander of V Corps. After the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, the 1st Engineers participated in the occupation of the Rhineland, with Farrell's 1st Battalion basing itself at Ebernhahn. The 1st Engineers returned to the United States in August and September 1919. After the war, Farrell joined the Regular Army. He served as an instructor at the Engineer School at Camp A. A. Humphreys from 1921 to 1924, and then at the United States Military Academy at West Point until 1926.\n\nFarrell resigned from the Regular Army in 1926, but remained in the reserves. The Governor of New York, Al Smith, appointed Farrell as Commissioner of Canals and Waterway for the State of New York. He was head of construction and engineering of the New York State Department of Public Works from 1930 until 1941. He was considered as a possible candidate to replace Frederick Stuart Greene as Superintendent of Public Works, but Greene did not retire. The Great Depression led to a vast expansion of public works activity, both nationally and in New York. Major projects in New York included the 1939 New York World's Fair and the construction of LaGuardia Airport.\n\nFarrell returned to active duty in February 1941 with the rank of lieutenant colonel to act as then-Colonel Leslie R. Groves, Jr.'s executive officer in the Operations Branch of the Construction Division under the Office of the Office of the Quartermaster General. At this point, the US Army was about to embark on a national mobilization, and it was the task of the Construction Division of the Quartermaster Corps to prepare the necessary accommodations and training facilities for the vast army that would be created. The enormous construction program had been dogged by bottlenecks, shortages, delays, spiralling costs, and poor living conditions at the construction sites. Newspapers began publishing accounts charging the Construction Division with incompetence, ineptitude, and inefficiency. Farrell and Groves worked out new, simplified procedures for centralized procurement that provided the flexibility needed to get projects done on time with the accountability that such enormous expenditures demanded. He was awarded the Legion of Merit for his services.\n\nIn September 1943, the Chief of Army Service Forces, Lieutenant General Brehon B. Somervell, created a special India Committee to coordinate activities in the China-Burma-India theater with those of Army Service Forces back home. Farrell, now a colonel, was appointed to the committee to oversee construction. The creation of a line of communications from India to China would be the largest engineer undertaking of the war. A number of new units were trained in the United States specifically for the task. In a reorganization later that year, Farrell became Chief Engineer of the Services of Supply in the China-Burma-India theater. In December he also became head of its Construction Division.\n\nFarrell, who was promoted to brigadier general in January 1944, organized his command into two divisions and six districts. He was in charge of the work inside India; construction of the Ledo Road itself was the responsibility of Colonel Lewis A. Pick. In addition to this work, Farrell had to support Operation Matterhorn, the deployment of B-29 bombers to China and India, which involved the construction and expansion of a series of air bases. The B-29s required runways that were almost twice the size of those for the older B-17s, and he was forced to divert his resources to construct a oil pipeline to the Matterhorn airfields.\n\nTo bridge the fast-following rivers of northern Burma, Pick and Farrell selected the H-20 Portable Steel Highway Bridge. Production of these had been discontinued in favor of the Bailey bridge, but Farrell's technical arguments won out and the Corps of Engineers had to reinstate production of the H-20. In view of these difficulties, Farrell obtained Bailey bridges from British sources. In the end, all the major bridges beyond the Irrawaddy River would be Baileys. He also made the decision, controversial in Washington, to shift the terminus of the oil pipeline from Calcutta to Chittagong in order to avoid crossing the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers, and the dangers of concentrating too many vulnerable installations in the Calcutta area. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.\n\nIn December 1944, the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, ordered Groves, now the Director of the Manhattan Project, to find a deputy. Stimson was concerned about what would happen if Groves became incapacitated. \"You can have any officer in the Army,\" Stimson told Groves, \"no matter who he is, or what duty he is on.\" Groves told Colonel Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, that his first choice would be Farrell. Nichols replied: \"He would be my first choice too.\" \"Site Y\" was the code name for the remote Los Alamos County, New Mexico facilities that housed the main group of researchers and was responsible for final assembly of the bombs.\n\nFarrell was briefed on the physics of the atomic bomb by Robert Oppenheimer, and he made several extended tours of the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, which had been chosen as the site for the Trinity test. On signing a receipt for the plutonium from Oak Ridge, Farrell commented: \n\nFarrell observed the Trinity (nuclear test) with Oppenheimer from the control dugout located from the test tower. In his report on the test to President Truman on 21 July 1945, Farrell stated: .\nFarrell assumed special responsibility for combat operations. He served on the target committee, acting as its chairman when Groves was absent. In July 1945, Farrell arrived on Guam to coordinate the project with the local commanders. One of his tasks was to brief General of the Army Douglas MacArthur. Farrell was joined by Rear Admiral William R. Purnell, who represented the Military Liaison Committee, and Captain William S. Parsons, the commander of Project Alberta. They became, informally, the \"Tinian Joint Chiefs\", with decision-making authority over the nuclear mission.\n\nFarrell notified Groves that the Little Boy bomb would be ready for use on or about 3 August, weather permitting. In the space of a week on Tinian, four B-29s crashed and burned on the runway. Parsons became very concerned. If a B-29 crashed with a Little Boy, the fire could cook off the explosive and detonate the weapon, with catastrophic consequences. Parsons raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with Farrell, who agreed that it might be a good idea. Farrell asked Parsons if he knew how to do it. \"No sir, I don't\", Parsons conceded, \"but I've got all afternoon to learn.\" After the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August, Farrell, along with Generals Carl Spaatz, Nathan Twining, Barney Giles and James H. Davies, debriefed Parsons, the aircrews and the observers, and sent Groves a detailed report.\n\nFarrell brought forward the date for the next attack because good weather was only predicted until 9 August. He signed the Fat Man bomb, \"To Hirohito, with love and kisses, T. F. Farrell.\" The bomb was loaded on the B-29 \"Bockscar\". During pre-flight inspection, a fuel pump was found to be faulty, meaning that of fuel in the bomb bay tank could not be used, although it would have to be carried. Farrell took the difficult decision to continue the mission, in view of the worsening weather. This was only the first of a number of problems that faced the mission crews that day, but the mission was carried out successfully.\n\nThe surrender of Japan on 14 August precluded further attacks. Groves had already directed Farrell to prepare teams to inspect the effects of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Farrell had begun assembling the required personnel and equipment. Farrell arrived in Hiroshima by air on 8 September as part of a group, equipped with portable geiger counters, that was headed by himself, and also included Brigadier General James B. Newman, Jr from the US Army Air Forces, Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator, and Colonel Stafford L. Warren, the head of the Manhattan District's Medical Section. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October. They were greatly impressed by both the damage done by the atomic bombs, and the extensive Japanese preparations for the Allied invasion that had been planned prior to the surrender.\n\nFarrell was promoted to the rank of major general in October 1945. He remained Deputy Commander of the Manhattan Project until he retired from active service in April 1946. He was appointed chairman of the New York City Housing Authority by Mayor William O'Dwyer on Robert Moses's recommendation. In the aftermath of the war, providing public housing, especially for returning veterans, was a major priority for the city. Unlike other projects of the time, New York City public housing was not racially segregated. Writing in 1950, Farrell declared, \"New York's public housing projects demonstrate that Negroes and whites can live together.\"\n\nHe served as a member of the evaluation board for Operation Crossroads, and was an advisor to Bernard Baruch, the United States' representative on the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission. In 1950, during the Korean War, Farrell returned to active duty with the Army once more, and served with the Defense Production Administration. In July 1951, he was transferred to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), the successor organization to the Manhattan Project, where he became the Assistant General Manager for Manufacturing. In this role, he oversaw a vast increase in the Commission's production capabilities. The construction of new reactors at the Hanford and Savannah River Sites would eventually triple the production of nuclear weapons.\n\nFarrell left the AEC and active duty Army again in February 1952. He subsequently worked as a consultant for the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority on projects such as the Cross Bronx Expressway. From 1960 to 1964, he worked on the preparations for the 1964 New York World's Fair.\n\nHis children were Thomas, Barbara, Peter, Patricia, and Stephen. Thomas graduated from West Point in the class of 1942, received the Silver Star Medal and the Distinguished Service Cross, and reached the rank of captain before being killed at Anzio on 25 February 1944. An Army port repair ship, the \"Thomas F. Farrell Jr.\", was named in his honor. Peter graduated from West Point in the class of 1950. He served with the Army in the Vietnam War, where he commanded the 6th Battalion, 56th Air Defense Artillery during the Tet Offensive. He retired from the Army in 1978 with the rank of colonel. Farrell's daughter, Barbara Vucanovich, was the first woman from Nevada to be elected to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1983 to 1997. His granddaughter, Patricia Dillon Cafferata, served as Nevada State Treasurer from 1983 to 1987. Farrell died at Saint Mary's Hospital in Reno, Nevada, on 11 April 1967. His wife Ynez had died the year before. Ironically, the man who had spent a lifetime building things was principally remembered for the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1706779", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1706779", "title": "Tofiq Bahramov", "text": "Tofiq Bahramov\n\nTofiq Bahramov (; ; 29 January 1925 – 26 March 1993), in England often incorrectly referred to as \"the Russian linesman\", was a Soviet footballer and football referee from Azerbaijan.\n\nHe was notable for being the linesman who helped to award a contentious goal for England in the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final against West Germany. As a referee earlier in the tournament, he drew attention for denying a Swiss goal in a first-round game between Switzerland and Spain.\n\nAfter his death in 1993, Azerbaijan's then national stadium was renamed the Tofiq Bahramov Stadium in his honour.\n\nBahramov was originally a footballer playing for Neftchi Baku, but a serious leg injury prevented him from continuing his playing career and he became a referee. He was elected onto the FIFA panel of referees in 1964. In the 1966 World Cup he officiated as a linesman for both the opening match and the Final, and refereed a first round match. In the 1970 World Cup he officiated at three matches including a semi-final. In 1972, he refereed the first leg of the UEFA Cup Final between the English clubs Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur. After retiring as a referee, he subsequently served for some years as general secretary of the Football Federation of Azerbaijan.\n\nIn the 1966 World Cup Final, with the score at 2–2 and after 11 minutes of the first period of extra time, Geoff Hurst of England fired a shot on goal which bounced off the crossbar sharply downwards, hit the ground, and then spun backwards away from the goal. There were some moments of indecision by referee Gottfried Dienst before he noticed that Bahramov, who was the linesman at that end of the ground, was signalling to him. Eventually, Dienst awarded a goal to England, who went on to win the game 4–2.\n\nThe decision to award the third England goal is still debated. In England, it is commonly believed that the decision was correct, while in Germany it is commonly said that Bahramov made a mistake, and the goal has entered the German vernacular, as any situation in which a ball hits the crossbar and is reflected downwards, landing just before or behind the goal line, is described as a \"Wembley-Tor\". After the match, many newspapers referred to the \"Russian linesman\" who awarded the goal, as Azerbaijan was part of the Soviet Union at the time, and the nickname stuck to the point where his real name was all but forgotten.\n\nAccording to the Laws of the Game, for a goal to be awarded, the ball must cross the goal line, with its full diameter behind the full width of the line. The Germans argue that if that were the case, the ball would likely have bounced from there into the net, not out on the field as it did. In addition, German players claimed to have seen chalk dust, which would indicate it was not a goal. The English counter by saying that the put on the ball after hitting the crossbar could just as likely have caused the ball to bounce behind the line and then back out of the goal—as had happened in a later match between the two countries. Roger Hunt claimed to have seen the ball bounce behind the line.\n\nWhen Bahramov wrote his memoirs, he stated that he believed the ball had bounced back not from the crossbar, but from the net, so the further movement of the ball was already insignificant, and not visible for him either. Bahramov loved refereeing and the game of football in general, and described football matches as,\n\nduels...full of unforeseen turns and even real miracles. And who does not want to be a magician if even for just 90 minutes?\n\nA 1996 study by Ian Reid and Andrew Zisserman (University of Oxford) came to the conclusion that the ball was at least 6 cm away from being a goal. Contrary to this however, on 4 January 2016, a review of the goal on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football concluded that the ball did in fact cross the line.\n\nThe Azerbaijan national stadium in Baku is named the Tofiq Bahramov Stadium in his honour. It was renamed in 1993, shortly after Azeri independence and Bahramov's death, having previously been named after the Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin.\n\nWhen England were drawn in the same group as Azerbaijan in qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, a ceremony was held prior to the meeting at the stadium to honor his memory, with attendees including Geoff Hurst, Michel Platini and Sepp Blatter. A statue of him was also unveiled at the ceremony and he became the first referee to have a stadium named after him. During the same visit, his son Bahram Bahramov met representatives of the English fans and expressed his pleasure that the famous \"Russian linesman\" of 1966 had finally regained his true nationality. \"Now that Azerbaijan is independent it’s very right for him to be remembered as a member of the Azeri nation. People like Tofiq Bahramov are only born once in a hundred years.”\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9896437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9896437", "title": "Too big to fail", "text": "Too big to fail\n\nThe \"too big to fail\" theory asserts that certain corporations, particularly financial institutions, are so large and so interconnected that their failure would be disastrous to the greater economic system, and that they therefore must be supported by government when they face potential failure. The colloquial term \"too big to fail\" was popularized by U.S. Congressman Stewart McKinney in a 1984 Congressional hearing, discussing the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's intervention with Continental Illinois. The term had previously been used occasionally in the press.\n\nProponents of this theory believe that some institutions are so important that they should become recipients of beneficial financial and economic policies from governments or central banks. Some economists such as Paul Krugman hold that economies of scale in banks and in other businesses are worth preserving, so long as they are well regulated in proportion to their economic clout, and therefore that \"too big to fail\" status can be acceptable. The global economic system must also deal with sovereign states being too big to fail.\n\nOpponents believe that one of the problems that arises is moral hazard whereby a company that benefits from these protective policies will seek to profit by it, deliberately taking positions (see asset allocation) that are high-risk high-return, as they are able to leverage these risks based on the policy preference they receive. The term has emerged as prominent in public discourse since the 2007–08 global financial crisis. Critics see the policy as counterproductive and that large banks or other institutions should be left to fail if their risk management is not effective. Some critics, such as Alan Greenspan, believe that such large organisations should be deliberately broken up: \"If they're too big to fail, they're too big\". More than fifty prominent economists, financial experts, bankers, finance industry groups, and banks themselves have called for breaking up large banks into smaller institutions.\n\nIn 2014, the International Monetary Fund and others said the problem still had not been dealt with. While the individual components of the new regulation for systemically important banks (additional capital requirements, enhanced supervision and resolution regimes) likely reduced the prevalence of TBTF, the fact that there is a definite list of systemically important banks considered TBTF has a partly offsetting impact.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke also defined the term in 2010: \"A too-big-to-fail firm is one whose size, complexity, interconnectedness, and critical functions are such that, should the firm go unexpectedly into liquidation, the rest of the financial system and the economy would face severe adverse consequences.\" He continued that: \"Governments provide support to too-big-to-fail firms in a crisis not out of favoritism or particular concern for the management, owners, or creditors of the firm, but because they recognize that the consequences for the broader economy of allowing a disorderly failure greatly outweigh the costs of avoiding the failure in some way. Common means of avoiding failure include facilitating a merger, providing credit, or injecting government capital, all of which protect at least some creditors who otherwise would have suffered losses. ... If the crisis has a single lesson, it is that the too-big-to-fail problem must be solved.\"\n\nBernanke cited several risks with too-big-to-fail institutions:\n\nPrior to the Great Depression, U.S. consumer bank deposits were not guaranteed by the government, increasing the risk of a bank run, in which a large number of depositors withdraw their deposits at the same time. Since banks lend most of the deposits and only retain a fraction in the proverbial vault, a bank run can render the bank insolvent. During the Depression, hundreds of banks became insolvent and depositors lost their money. As a result, the U.S. enacted the 1933 Banking Act, sometimes called the Glass–Steagall Act, which created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to insure deposits up to a limit of $2,500, with successive increases to the current $250,000. In exchange for the deposit insurance provided by the federal government, depository banks are highly regulated and expected to invest excess customer deposits in lower-risk assets.\n\nIn contrast to depository banks, investment banks generally obtain funds from sophisticated investors and often make complex, risky investments with the funds, speculating either for their own account or on behalf of their investors. They also are \"market makers\" in that they serve as intermediaries between two investors that wish to take opposite sides of a financial transaction. The Glass-Steagall Act separated investment and depository banking until its repeal in 1999. Prior to 2008, the government did not explicitly guarantee the investor funds, so investment banks were not subject to the same regulations as depository banks and were allowed to take considerably more risk.\n\nInvestment banks, along with other innovations in banking and finance referred to as the shadow banking system, grew to rival the depository system by 2007. They became subject to the equivalent of a bank run in 2007 and 2008, in which investors (rather than depositors) withdrew sources of financing from the shadow system. This run became known as the subprime mortgage crisis. During 2008, the five largest U.S. investment banks either failed (Lehman Brothers), were bought out by other banks at fire-sale prices (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch) or were at risk of failure and obtained depository banking charters to obtain additional Federal Reserve support (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). In addition, the government provided bailout funds via the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008.\n\nFed Chair Ben Bernanke described in November 2013 how the Panic of 1907 was essentially a run on the non-depository financial system, with many parallels to the crisis of 2008. One of the results of the Panic of 1907 was the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.\n\nBefore 1950, U.S. federal bank regulators had essentially two options for resolving an insolvent institution: 1) closure, with liquidation of assets and payouts for insured depositors; or 2) purchase and assumption, encouraging the acquisition of assets and assumption of liabilities by another firm. A third option was made available by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950: providing assistance, the power to support an institution through loans or direct federal acquisition of assets, until it could recover from its distress.\n\nThe statute limited the \"assistance\" option to cases where \"continued operation of the bank is essential to provide adequate banking service\". Regulators shunned this third option for many years, fearing that if regionally or nationally important banks were thought generally immune to liquidation, markets in their shares would be distorted. Thus, the assistance option was never employed during the period 1950–1969, and very seldom thereafter. Research into historical banking trends suggests that the consumption loss associated with National Banking Era bank runs was far more costly than the consumption loss from stock market crashes.\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act was passed in 1991, giving the FDIC the responsibility to rescue an insolvent bank by the least costly method. The Act had the implicit goal of eliminating the widespread belief among depositors that a loss of depositors and bondholders will be prevented for large banks. However, the Act included an exception in cases of systemic risk, subject to the approval of two-thirds of the FDIC Board of Directors, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Treasury Secretary.\n\nBank size, complexity, and interconnectedness with other banks may inhibit the ability of the government to resolve (wind-down) the bank without significant disruption to the financial system or economy, as occurred with the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008. This risk of \"too big to fail\" entities increases the likelihood of a government bailout using taxpayer dollars.\n\nThe largest U.S. banks continue to grow larger while the concentration of bank assets increases. The largest six U.S. banks had assets of $9,576 billion as of year-end 2012, per their 2012 annual reports (SEC Form 10K). For scale, this was 59% of the U.S. GDP for 2012 of $16,245 billion. The top 5 U.S. banks had approximately 30% of the U.S. banking assets in 1998; this rose to 45% by 2008 and to 48% by 2010, before falling to 47% in 2011.\n\nThis concentration continued despite the subprime mortgage crisis and its aftermath. During March 2008, JP Morgan Chase acquired investment bank Bear Stearns. Bank of America acquired investment bank Merrill Lynch in September 2008. Wells Fargo acquired Wachovia in January 2009. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley obtained depository bank holding company charters, which gave them access to additional Federal Reserve credit lines.\n\nBank deposits for all U.S. banks ranged between approximately 60–70% of GDP from 1960 to 2006, then jumped during the crisis to a peak of nearly 84% in 2009 before falling to 77% by 2011.\n\nThe number of U.S. commercial and savings bank institutions reached a peak of 14,495 in 1984; this fell to 6,532 by the end of 2010. The ten largest U.S. banks held nearly 50% of U.S. deposits as of 2011.\n\nSince the full amount of the deposits and debts of \"too big to fail\" banks are effectively guaranteed by the government, large depositors and investors view investments with these banks as a safer investment than deposits with smaller banks. Therefore, large banks are able to pay lower interest rates to depositors and investors than small banks are obliged to pay.\n\nIn October 2009, Sheila Bair, at that time the Chairperson of the FDIC, commented:\n\nA study conducted by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that the difference between the cost of funds for banks with more than $100 billion in assets and the cost of funds for smaller banks widened dramatically after the formalization of the \"too big to fail\" policy in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2008. This shift in the large banks' cost of funds was in effect equivalent to an indirect \"too big to fail\" subsidy of $34 billion per year to the 18 U.S. banks with more than $100 billion in assets.\n\nThe editors of Bloomberg View estimated there was an $83 billion annual subsidy to the 10 largest United States banks, reflecting a funding advantage of 0.8 percentage points due to implicit government support, meaning the profits of such banks are largely a taxpayer-backed illusion.\n\nAnother study by Frederic Schweikhard and Zoe Tsesmelidakis, estimated the amount saved by America's biggest banks from having a perceived safety net of a government bailout was $120 billion from 2007 to 2010. For America's biggest banks the estimated savings was $53 billion for Citigroup, $32 billion for Bank of America, $10 billion for JPMorgan, $8 billion for Wells Fargo, and $4 billion for AIG. The study noted that passage of the Dodd–Frank Act—which promised an end to bailouts—did nothing to raise the price of credit (i.e., lower the implicit subsidy) for the \"too-big-too-fail\" institutions.\n\nOne 2013 study (Acharya, Anginer, and Warburton) measured the funding cost advantage provided by implicit government support to large financial institutions. Credit spreads were lower by approximately 28 basis points (0.28%) on average over the 1990–2010 period, with a peak of more than 120 basis points in 2009. In 2010, the implicit subsidy was worth nearly $100 billion to the largest banks. The authors concluded: \"Passage of Dodd–Frank did not eliminate expectations of government support.\"\n\nEconomist Randall S. Kroszner summarized several approaches to evaluating the funding cost differential between large and small banks. The paper discusses methodology and does not specifically answer the question of whether larger institutions have an advantage.\n\nDuring November 2013, the Moody's credit rating agency reported that it would no longer assume the eight largest U.S. banks would receive government support in the event they faced bankruptcy. However, the GAO reported that politicians and regulators would still face significant pressure to bail out large banks and their creditors in the event of a financial crisis.\n\nSome critics have argued that \"The way things are now banks reap profits if their trades pan out, but taxpayers can be stuck picking up the tab if their big bets sink the company.\" Additionally, as discussed by Senator Bernie Sanders, if taxpayers are contributing to rescue these companies from bankruptcy, they \"should be rewarded for assuming the risk by sharing in the gains that result from this government bailout\".\n\nIn this sense, Alan Greenspan affirms that, \"Failure is an integral part, a necessary part of a market system.\" Thereby, although the financial institutions that were bailed out were indeed important to the financial system, the fact that they took risk beyond what they would otherwise, should be enough for the Government to let them face the consequences of their actions. It would have been a lesson to motivate institutions to proceed differently next time.\n\nThe political power of large banks and risks of economic impact from major prosecutions has led to use of the term \"too big to jail\" regarding the leaders of large financial institutions.\n\nOn March 6, 2013, United States Attorney General Eric Holder testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the size of large financial institutions has made it difficult for the Justice Department to bring criminal charges when they are suspected of crimes, because such charges can threaten the existence of a bank and therefore their interconnectedness may endanger the national or global economy. \"Some of these institutions have become too large,\" Holder told the Committee, \"It has an inhibiting impact on our ability to bring resolutions that I think would be more appropriate,\" contradicting earlier written testimony from a deputy assistant attorney general who defended the Justice Department's \"vigorous enforcement against wrongdoing\". Holder has financial ties to at least one law firm benefiting from \"de facto\" immunity to prosecution, and prosecution rates against crimes by large financial institutions are at 20-year lows.\n\nFour days later, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard W. Fisher and Vice-President Harvey Rosenblum co-authored a \"Wall Street Journal\" op-ed about the failure of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to provide for adequate regulation of large financial institutions. In advance of his March 8 speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Fisher proposed requiring breaking up large banks into smaller banks so that they are \"too small to save,\" advocating the withholding from mega-banks access to both Federal Deposit Insurance and Federal Reserve discount window, and requiring disclosure of this lack of federal insurance and financial solvency support to their customers. This was the first time such a proposal had been made by a high-ranking U.S. banking official or a prominent conservative. Other conservatives including Thomas Hoenig, Ed Prescott, Glenn Hubbard, and David Vitter also advocated breaking up the largest banks, but liberal commentator Matthew Yglesias questioned their motives and the existence of a true bipartisan consensus.\n\nIn a January 29, 2013 letter to Holder, Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Charles Grassley (R-IA) had criticized this Justice Department policy citing \"important questions about the Justice Department's prosecutorial philosophy\". After receipt of a DoJ response letter, Brown and Grassley issued a statement saying, \"The Justice Department's response is aggressively evasive. It does not answer our questions. We want to know how and why the Justice Department has determined that certain financial institutions are 'too big to jail' and that prosecuting those institutions would damage the financial system.\"\n\nKareem Serageldin pleaded guilty on November 22, 2013 for his role in inflating the value of mortgage bonds as the housing market collapsed, and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison. As of April 30, 2014, Serageldin remains the \"only Wall Street executive prosecuted as a result of the financial crisis\" that triggered the Great Recession.\n\nThe proposed solutions to the \"too big to fail\" issue are controversial. Some options include breaking up the banks, introducing regulations to reduce risk, adding higher bank taxes for larger institutions, and increasing monitoring through oversight committees.\n\nMore than fifty economists, financial experts, bankers, finance industry groups, and banks themselves have called for breaking up large banks into smaller institutions. This is advocated both to limit risk to the financial system posed by the largest banks as well as to limit their political influence.\n\nFor example, economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote in 2009 that: \"In the United States, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, large banks have been responsible for the bulk of the [bailout] cost to taxpayers. America has let 106 smaller banks go bankrupt this year alone. It's the mega-banks that present the mega-costs ... banks that are too big to fail are too big to exist. If they continue to exist, they must exist in what is sometimes called a \"utility\" model, meaning that they are heavily regulated.\" He also wrote about several causes of the crisis related to the size, incentives, and interconnection of the mega-banks.\n\nThe United States passed the Dodd–Frank Act in July 2010 to help strengthen regulation of the financial system in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis that began in 2007. Dodd–Frank requires banks to reduce their risk taking, by requiring greater financial cushions (i.e., lower leverage ratios or higher capital ratios), among other steps.\n\nBanks are required to maintain a ratio of high-quality, easily sold assets, in the event of financial difficulty either at the bank or in the financial system. These are capital requirements. Further, since the 2008 crisis, regulators have worked with banks to reduce leverage ratios. For example, the leverage ratio for investment bank Goldman Sachs declined from a peak of 25.2 during 2007 to 11.4 in 2012, indicating a much-reduced risk profile.\n\nThe Dodd–Frank Act includes a form of the Volcker Rule, a proposal to ban proprietary trading by commercial banks. Proprietary trading refers to using customer deposits to speculate in risky assets for the benefit of the bank rather than customers. The Dodd–Frank Act as enacted into law includes several loopholes to the ban, allowing proprietary trading in certain circumstances. However, the regulations required to enforce these elements of the law were not implemented during 2013 and were under attack by bank lobbying efforts.\n\nAnother major banking regulation, the Glass–Steagall Act from 1933, was effectively repealed in 1999. The repeal allowed depository banks to enter into additional lines of business. Senators John McCain and Elizabeth Warren proposed bringing back Glass-Steagall during 2013.\n\nEconomist Willem Buiter proposes a tax to internalize the massive costs inflicted by \"too big to fail\" institution. \"When size creates externalities, do what you would do with any negative externality: tax it. The other way to limit size is to tax size. This can be done through capital requirements that are progressive in the size of the business (as measured by value added, the size of the balance sheet or some other metric). Such measures for preventing the New Darwinism of the survival of the fittest and the politically best connected should be distinguished from regulatory interventions based on the narrow leverage ratio aimed at regulating risk (regardless of size, except for a de minimis lower limit).\"\n\nOn November 4, 2011, a policy research and development entity, called the Financial Stability Board, released a list of 29 banks worldwide that they considered \"systemically important financial institutions\"—financial organisations whose size \"and role\" meant that any failure could cause serious systemic problems. Of the list, 16 are based in Europe, nine in North America, and four in Asia:\n\nMore than fifty notable economists, financial experts, bankers, finance industry groups, and banks themselves have called for breaking up large banks into smaller institutions. (See also Divestment.)\n\nSome economists such as Paul Krugman hold that economies of scale in banks and in other businesses are worth preserving, so long as they are well regulated in proportion to their economic clout, and therefore that \"too big to fail\" status can be acceptable. The global economic system must also deal with sovereign states being too big to fail. Krugman wrote in January 2010 that it was more important to reduce bank risk taking (leverage) than to break them up.\n\nEconomist Simon Johnson has advocated both increased regulation as well as breaking up the larger banks, not only to protect the financial system but to reduce the political power of the largest banks.\n\nOne of the most vocal opponents in the United States government of the \"too big to fail\" status of large American financial institutions in recent years has been Elizabeth Warren. At her first U.S. Senate Banking Committee hearing on February 14, 2013, Senator Warren pressed several banking regulators to answer when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and stated, \"I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial.'\" Videos of Warren's questioning, centering on \"too big to fail\", became popular on the internet, amassing more than 1 million views in a matter of days.\n\nOn March 6, 2013, United States Attorney General Eric Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Justice Department faces difficulty charging large banks with crimes because of the risk to the economy. Four days later, Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard W. Fisher wrote in advance of a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference that large banks should be broken up into smaller banks, and both Federal Deposit Insurance and Federal Reserve discount window access should end for large banks. Other conservatives including Thomas Hoenig, Ed Prescott, Glenn Hubbard, and David Vitter also advocated breaking up the largest banks.\n\nOn April 10, 2013, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde told the Economic Club of New York \"too big to fail\" banks had become \"more dangerous than ever\" and had to be controlled with \"comprehensive and clear regulation [and] more intensive and intrusive supervision\".\n\nRon Suskind claimed in his book \"Confidence Men\" that the administration of Barack Obama considered breaking up Citibank and other large banks that had been involved in the financial crisis of 2008. He said that Obama's staff, such as Timothy Geithner, refused to do so. The administration and Geithner have denied this version of events.\n\nMervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England during 2003–2013, called for cutting \"too big to fail\" banks down to size, as a solution to the problem of banks having taxpayer-funded guarantees for their speculative investment banking activities. \"If some banks are thought to be too big to fail, then, in the words of a distinguished American economist, they are too big. It is not sensible to allow large banks to combine high street retail banking with risky investment banking or funding strategies, and then provide an implicit state guarantee against failure.\"\n\nAlistair Darling disagreed; \"Many people talk about how to deal with the big banks – banks so important to the financial system that they cannot be allowed to fail, but the solution is not as simple, as some have suggested, as restricting the size of the banks\". As well, Alan Greenspan said that \"If they're too big to fail, they're too big,\" suggesting U.S. regulators to consider breaking up large financial institutions considered \"too big to fail\". He added, \"I don't think merely raising the fees or capital on large institutions or taxing them is enough ... they'll absorb that, they'll work with that, and it's totally inefficient and they'll still be using the savings.\" \n\nGallup reported in June 2013 that: \"Americans' confidence in U.S. banks increased to 26% in June, up from the record low of 21% the previous year. The percentage of Americans saying they have \"a great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in U.S. banks is now at its highest point since June 2008, but remains well below its pre-recession level of 41%, measured in June 2007. Between 2007 and 2012, confidence in banks fell by half—20 percentage points.\" Gallup also reported that: \"When Gallup first measured confidence in banks in 1979, 60% of Americans had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in them—second only to the church. This high level of confidence, which hasn't been matched since, was likely the result of the strong U.S. banking system established after the 1930s Great Depression and the related efforts of banks and regulators to build Americans' confidence in that system.\"\n\nIn the USA, the banking industry spent over $100 million lobbying politicians and regulators between January 1 and June 30, 2011. Lobbying in the finance, insurance and real estate industries has risen annually since 1998 and was approximately $500 million in 2012.\n\nPrior to the 2008 failure and bailout of multiple firms, there were \"too big to fail\" examples from 1763 when Leendert Pieter de Neufville in Amsterdam and Johann Ernst Gotzkowsky in Berlin failed, and from\nthe 1980s and 1990s. These included Continental Illinois and Long-Term Capital Management.\n\nAn early example of a bank rescued because it was \"too big to fail\" was the Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company during the 1980s.\n\nThe Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company experienced a fall in its overall asset quality during the early 1980s. Tight money, Mexico's default (1982) and plunging oil prices followed a period when the bank had aggressively pursued commercial lending business, Latin American syndicated loan business, and loan participation in the energy sector. Complicating matters further, the bank's funding mix was heavily dependent on large certificates of deposit and foreign money markets, which meant its depositors were more risk-averse than average retail depositors in the US.\n\nThe bank held significant participation in highly speculative oil and gas loans of Oklahoma's Penn Square Bank. When Penn Square failed in July 1982, the Continental's distress became acute, culminating with press rumors of failure and an investor-and-depositor run in early May 1984. In the first week of the run, the Fed permitted the Continental Illinois discount window credits on the order of $3.6 billion. Still in significant distress, the management obtained a further $4.5 billion in credits from a syndicate of money center banks the following week. These measures failed to stop the run, and regulators were confronted with a crisis.\n\nThe seventh-largest bank in the nation by deposits would very shortly be unable to meet its obligations. Regulators faced a tough decision about how to resolve the matter. Of the three options available, only two were seriously considered. Even banks much smaller than the Continental were deemed unsuitable for resolution by liquidation, owing to the disruptions this would have inevitably caused. The normal course would be to seek a purchaser (and indeed press accounts that such a search was underway contributed to Continental depositors' fears in 1984). However, in the tight-money financial climate of the early 1980s, no purchaser was forthcoming.\n\nBesides generic concerns of size, contagion of depositor panic and bank distress, regulators feared the significant disruption of national payment and settlement systems. Of special concern was the wide network of correspondent banks with high percentages of their capital invested in the Continental Illinois. Essentially, the bank was deemed \"too big to fail,\" and the \"provide assistance\" option was reluctantly taken. The dilemma then became how to provide assistance without significantly unbalancing the nation's banking system.\n\nTo prevent immediate failure, the Federal Reserve announced categorically that it would meet any liquidity needs the Continental might have, while the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) gave depositors and general creditors a full guarantee (not subject to the $100,000 FDIC deposit-insurance limit) and provided direct assistance of $2 billion (including participations). Money center banks assembled an additional $5.3 billion unsecured facility pending a resolution and resumption of more-normal business. These measures slowed, but did not stop, the outflow of deposits.\n\nIn a United States Senate hearing afterwards, the then Comptroller of the Currency C. T. Conover defended his position by admitting the regulators will not let the largest 11 banks fail.\n\nLong-Term Capital Management L.P. (LTCM) was a hedge fund management firm based in Greenwich, Connecticut that utilized absolute-return trading strategies combined with high financial leverage. The firm's master hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Portfolio L.P., collapsed in the late 1990s, leading to an agreement on September 23, 1998 among 14 financial institutions for a $3.6 billion recapitalization (bailout) under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.\n\nLTCM was founded in 1994 by John W. Meriwether, the former vice-chairman and head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers. Members of LTCM's board of directors included Myron S. Scholes and Robert C. Merton, who shared the 1997 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for a \"new method to determine the value of derivatives\". Initially successful with annualized returns of over 40% (after fees) in its first years, in 1998 it lost $4.6 billion in less than four months following the Russian financial crisis requiring financial intervention by the Federal Reserve, with the fund liquidating and dissolving in early 2000.\n\nIn March 2013, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions announced that Canada's six largest banks, the Bank of Montreal, the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, were too big to fail. Those six banks accounted for 90% of banking assets in Canada at that time. It noted that \"the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are considered, and relative importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the sixth bank (National).\"\n\nDespite the government's assurances, opposition parties and some media commentators in New Zealand say that the largest banks are too big to fail and have an implicit government guarantee.\n\nThe previous British Chancellor (finance minister) George Osborne has threatened to break up banks which are too big to fail.\n\nThe too-big-to-fail idea has led to legislators and governments facing the challenge of limiting the scope of these hugely important organisations, and regulating activities perceived as risky or speculative—to achieve this regulation in the UK, banks are advised to follow the UK's Independent Commission on Banking Report.\n\n\nBanking collapse:\n\nGeneral:\n\nWorks:\n\n"}

Although a 1940 Tour de France had been announced earlier, the outbreak of the war made it impossible for it to be held. After that, some attempts were made by the Germans during the war to have a Tour de France to maintain the sense of normality, but \"l'Auto\", the organising newspaper, refused. Some other races were run as a replacement.\n\nAfter World War II, \"l'Auto\" was closed for collaborating with the Germans. The rights to organise the Tour went to the French government. As two newspapers were interested in these rights, they each organised a small Tour of five stages; the race run by \"L'Équipe\" was considered the more successful, so \"L'Équipe\" was allowed to organise the 1947 Tour de France.\n\nAlready before the war, the political situation in Europe had its influence on the Tour de France. Political reasons caused Italy, Germany and Spain to refuse to send teams to France for the 1939 Tour de France. The 1938 Tour de France winner, Gino Bartali, was among those affected. Henri Desgrange, the original race organizer, and Jacques Goddet, his deputy and replacement, announced plans for a Tour de France in August 1940.\n\nHenri Desgrange planned a Tour for 1940, after war had started but before France had been invaded. The route, approved by military authorities, included a route along the Maginot Line. Teams would have been drawn from military units in France, including the British, who would have been organised by a journalist, Bill Mills. The plans were dropped after the German invasion. The records and paperwork of the Tour were taken south to keep them safe but were never seen again. Desgrange died in August 1940, and his successor, Jacques Goddet, initially wanted to organise the Tour during the war, arguing that sport should remain neutral.\n\nIn 1941, the newspaper \"Paris-Soir\", run by Germans, tried to persuade \"l'Auto\" to coorganize the Tour, but Goddet did not accept.\n\nThe German Propaganda Staffel wanted the Tour to be run and offered facilities otherwise denied, in the hope of maintaining a sense of normality. They offered to open the borders between German-occupied France in the north and the nominally independent Vichy France in the south, so that \"l'Auto\" could organize a Tour, together with \"La France Socialiste\", but Goddet refused. He was, in any case, in little position to run a race of that scale because many of the staff had left \"L'Auto\"'s office in Paris to go south.\n\n\"La France Socialiste\", run by Jean Leulliot, Goddet's former colleague at \"L'Auto\", did not have the same reluctance, and organized the race on its own. Leulliot, who had been manager of the French team that won the Tour in 1937, had become head of sport at \"La France Socialiste\" which, despite its name, was a right-wing paper that sympathized with the Germans. Leulliot assembled sixty-nine riders for the race, the Circuit de France, which ran from 28 September to 4 October 1942. Over six stages and , it went from Paris to Paris via Le Mans, Poitiers, Limoges, Clermont-Ferrand, St-Étienne, Lyon and Dijon.\n\nOne of the riders, Émile Idée, told the writer and cyclist Jean Bobet that he had been threatened with the Gestapo if he didn't take part. Bobet said: \"I asked him to repeat it to see if I had understood. I was stunned [\"dans la tête ça fait tilt\"]!\"\n\nThe Circuit de France was organized between 28 September 1942 and 4 October 1942 by \"La France Socialiste\" in both the occupied zone and Vichy France, to give a feeling of nationality. The race had six multinational teams, and was won by François Neuville. The inexperience of the organizers, combined with bad weather and logistical problems, made the race a disaster. Although there were plans to hold the race again in 1943, it was never held.\n\nThe mountains classification was won by Pierre Brambilla.\n\nThe 1943 Tour de France was not held, but instead, \"L'Auto\" organized a readers' poll in 1943 to name the perfect team for a Tour de France, were one to be run. More than 10,000 took part.\n\nIn 1943, \"l'Auto\" ran what it called the \"Grand Prix du Tour de France\", the paper's assessment of the greatest riders calculated using their placings in single-day races, all organised by \"l'Auto\". At the end of the season, a yellow jersey was given to the cyclist with the best overall classification. The winner was Jo Goutorbe. Even though The Grand Prix du Tour de France was organized by Jacques Goddet, he made it clear that it was not an official Tour de France.\nThe Grand Prix du Tour de France 1943 consisted of the following races:\n\nIn 1944, the Grand Prix du Tour de France was done again, but it was not completed because the liberation of France stopped the races from being run. Maurice De Simpelaere was the leader at the time the races were interrupted.\n\nAfter the liberation of France in 1944, \"L'Auto\" was closed and its belongings, including the Tour de France were sequestrated by the state for having published articles too close to the Germans. All rights to the Tour were therefore owned by the government. Jacques Goddet was allowed to publish another daily sports paper, \"L'Équipe\", but there was a rival candidate to run the Tour: a consortium of the magazines \"Sports\" and \"Miroir Sprint\". Each organised a candidate race. \"L'Équipe\" and \"Le Parisien Libéré\" had \"La Course du Tour de France\", (\"The Race of the Tour de France\" – as close as they dared come to calling the race by its original name), and \"Sports\" and \"Miroir Sprint\" had \"La Ronde de France\". Both were five-stage races, the longest the government would allow because of shortages.\n\nFrom 10 July to 14 July 1946, the Ronde de France was organized. The cyclists were divided in commercial teams, but the commercial teams were each allowed to field two teams, one composed of French cyclists and one of foreign cyclists. It was won by Giulio Bresci, who also won two stages and the mountains classification.\n\nThe Course du Tour de France (), also known as Monaco–Paris was organised in 1946 by Le Parisien Libéré together with l'Equipe. The race had many things familiar to the old Tours de France: there were six national teams and five regional French teams, and the leader in the race was also given a yellow jersey.\nThe race was won by French cyclist Apo Lazarides. The mountains classification was won by Jean Robic.\n\nThe Course du Tour de France, \"L'Équipe\"'s race, was better organised and appealed more to the public because it featured national teams which had been so successful before the war, when French cycling was at a high. In late 1946, both organisers intended to organise their race again in 1947, this time at the same time. The UCI then decided in December 1946 to give \"L'Équipe\" the right to organize the 1947 Tour de France. After their main rival \"Sports\" objected to this, the rights were instead given to La Societé du Parc du Princes, because this was thought to be a neutral choice. In early 1947, it became clear that the organisation of the Tour de France was difficult financially without a newspaper and, in June 1947, one month before the 1947 Tour de France would start, the Societé du Parc du Princes transferred the rights to \"L'Equipe\".\n\nÉmile Besson, communist sports writer and a member of the Resistance from 1943 when he was 17, called \"L'Équipe\"'s victory political. Besson, who was a member of the national study into French sport under the Occupation, set up by Marie-George Buffet when she was sports minister between 1997 and 2002, said:\nIt was a bit much to have given them the right to run the Tour again after all that [referring to \"L'Auto\"'s pro-German attitude and closure]. Goddet had the keys to the Velodrome d'Hiver when [the Germans wanted it] in the round-up of Jews in July 1942. After the Liberation, the battle between Left and Right had the Tour as one of its prizes.\n\nGoddet had to defend his wartime behaviour at an inquiry in Algiers. He pointed to the way he had allowed Resistance workers to print anti-German tracts at his newspaper and called Émilien Amaury in his defence. Amaury had a blameless record in the Resistance. He was also a right-wing businessman; his ideals close to Goddet's. It was with Amaury and his paper, \"Le Parisien Libéré\", that Goddet ran La Course du Tour de France. It was Amaury's reputation that landed Goddet the Tour. That, says Besson, and because the rival candidate was two magazines with a communist background and President Charles de Gaulle was determined to limit communist influence. De Gaulle had spent much of his time during the war trying to prevent communist domination of the Resistance. Communists held many key positions in France just before and after Liberation but De Gaulle refused even to thank them for their work. Albert Bourlon, who won the 14th stage of the 1947 Tour de France, told Jean Bobet that he was convinced that his membership of the Communist Party denied him access to the race afterwards.\n\nAmaury eventually took control of both the paper and the Tour de France, and as of 2012 is still the organiser of the Tour de France, under the name Amaury Sport Organisation.\n\nJean Leulliot was tried for his role in organising races under German patronage but he was cleared after fellow journalists, including Goddet, spoke in his favour.\n\n"}

The parish lies on the coast of the Bristol Channel. The village is east of Combe Martin, at an elevation of 180 metres, separated from the coast by high cliffs.\n\nThe village was mentioned in the Domesday Book as \"Trendesholt\". The name is of Old English origin, and appears to mean \"hill-spur of a circular hill named Trendel\".\n\nThe small parish church is dedicated to St Peter. The church dates from the 15th century, and is a Grade II* listed building.\n\nIt is in the Shirwell deanery of the Church of England. James Hannington, a future saint and a martyr, took charge of the parish church in 1873.\n\nIn 1973 a small ecologically-themed free rock festival was held on a clifftop site near Trentishoe, titled the Trentishoe Whole Earth Fayre (possibly following a minuscule 1972 festival of which records are sparse). The 'International Times', in 1973, noted \"The Trentishoe bash, kicking off on July 9th and running for a couple of weeks, looks like kindling a similar flame to that ignited by the Glastonbury Fayre\".

{"id": "28371067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28371067", "title": "Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope", "text": "Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope\n\nThe Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) is a NASA infrared space observatory currently under development. WFIRST was recommended in 2010 by United States National Research Council Decadal Survey committee as the top priority for the next decade of astronomy. On February 17, 2016, WFIRST was approved for development and launch.\n\nWFIRST is based on an existing 2.4 m wide field-of-view telescope and will carry two scientific instruments. The Wide-Field Instrument is a 288-megapixel multi-band near-infrared camera, providing a sharpness of images comparable to that achieved by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) over a 0.28 square degree field of view, 100 times larger than that of the HST. The Coronagraphic Instrument is a high-contrast, small field-of-view camera and spectrometer covering visible and near-infrared wavelengths using novel starlight-suppression technology.\n\nThe design of WFIRST is based on one of the proposed designs for the Joint Dark Energy Mission between NASA and DOE. WFIRST adds some extra capabilities to the original JDEM proposal, including a search for extra-solar planets using gravitational microlensing. In its present incarnation (2015), a large fraction of its primary mission will be focused on probing the expansion history of the Universe and the growth of cosmic structure with multiple methods in overlapping redshift ranges, with the goal of precisely measuring the effects of dark energy, the consistency of general relativity, and the curvature of spacetime.\n\nOn February 12, 2018, development on the WFIRST mission was proposed to be terminated in the President's FY19 budget request, due to a reduction in the overall NASA astrophysics budget and higher priorities elsewhere in the agency. In March 2018 Congress approved funding to continue making progress on WFIRST until at least September 30, 2018, in a bill stating that Congress \"rejects the cancellation of scientific priorities recommended by the National Academy of Sciences decadal survey process\". In testimony before Congress in July 2018, NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine proposed slowing down the development of WFIRST in order to accommodate a cost increase in the James Webb Space Telescope, which would result in decreased funding for WFIRST in 2020/2021.\n\nThe original design of WFIRST (Design Reference Mission 1), studied in 2011–2012, featured a diameter unobstructed three-mirror anastigmat telescope.\nIt contained a single instrument, a visible to near-infrared imager/slitless prism spectrometer. In 2012, another possibility emerged: NASA could use a second-hand National Reconnaissance Office telescope made by Harris Corporation to accomplish a mission like the one planned for WFIRST. NRO offered to donate two telescopes, the same size as the Hubble Space Telescope but with a shorter focal length and hence a wider field of view. This provided important political momentum to the project, even though the telescope represents only a modest fraction of the cost of the mission and the boundary conditions from the NRO design may push the total cost over that of a fresh design. This mission concept, called WFIRST-AFTA (Astrophysics Focused Telescope Assets), was matured by a scientific and technical team; this mission is now the only present NASA plan for the use of the NRO telescopes.\nThe WFIRST baseline design includes a coronagraph to enable the direct imaging of exoplanets.\n\nWFIRST has had a number of different implementations studied (including the Joint Dark Energy Mission-Omega configuration, an Interim Design Reference Mission featuring a 1.3m telescope, Design Reference Mission 1 with a 1.3m telescope, Design Reference Mission 2, with a 1.1m telescope, and several iterations of the AFTA 2.4m configuration). In the most recent report, WFIRST was considered for both geosynchronous and L2 orbits. Appendix C documents the disadvantage of L2 vs. geosynchronous in the data rate and propellant, but the advantages for improved observing constraints, better thermal stability, and more benign radiation environment at L2. Some science cases (such as exoplanet microlensing parallax) are improved at L2, and the possibility of robotic servicing at either of the locations requires further study.\n\nThe project is led by a team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The Project Scientist for WFIRST from its inception until his death in 2017 was Neil Gehrels, who was succeeded by Jeffrey Kruk; the Project Manager is Kevin Grady; the Program Scientist is Dominic Benford; the Program Executive is John Gagosian; the Formulation Science Working Group is chaired by Gehrels with Deputy Chairs David Spergel and Jeremy Kasdin.\n\nOn November 30, 2018 NASA announced it had awarded the contract for the telescope. This was for a part called the Optical Telescope Assembly or OTA, and runs to 2025. This is in conjunction with the Goddard Space Flight Center for which the OTA is planned for delivery as part of this contract.\n\nThe science objectives of WFIRST aim to address cutting-edge questions in cosmology and exoplanet research, including:\n\nWFIRST will have two instruments. The Wide-Field Instrument (WFI) is a 288-megapixel camera with a 0.28 square degree field of view providing multi-band near-infrared (0.7 to 2.0 micrometers) imaging using a HgCdTe focal-plane array with a pixel size of 110 milliarcseconds. The detector array will be composed of H4RG-10 detectors provided by Teledyne. It includes a grism for wide-field slitless spectroscopy and an integral field spectrograph for small-field spectroscopy. The second instrument is a high contrast coronagraph covering shorter wavelengths (0.4 to 1.0 micrometers) using novel starlight-suppression technology. It is intended to achieve a part-per-billion suppression of starlight to enable the detection of planets only 0.1 arcseconds away from their host stars.\n\nIn fiscal year 2014, Congress provided $56 million for WFIRST, and in 2015 Congress provided $50 million. The fiscal year 2016 spending bill provided $90 million for WFIRST, far above NASA's request of $14 million, allowing the mission to enter the \"formulation phase\" in February 2016. On February 18, 2016, NASA announced that WFIRST had formally become a project (as opposed to a study), meaning that the agency intends to carry out the mission as baselined; at that time, the \"AFTA\" portion of the name was dropped as only that approach is being pursued. WFIRST is on a plan for a mid-2020s launch. The total cost of WFIRST is expected at more than $2 billion; NASA's 2015 budget estimate was around $2.0 billion in 2010 dollars, which corresponds to around $2.7 billion in real year (inflation-adjusted) dollars. In April 2017, NASA commissioned an independent review of the project to ensure that the mission scope and cost were understood and aligned. The review acknowledged that WFIRST offers \"groundbreaking and unprecedented survey capabilities for dark energy, exoplanet, and general astrophysics\", but directed the mission to \"reduce cost and complexity sufficient to have a cost estimate consistent with the $3.2B cost target set at the beginning of Phase A.\" NASA announced the reductions taken in response to this recommendation, and that WFIRST would proceed to its mission design review in February 2018 and begin Phase B by April 2018. NASA confirmed that the changes made to the project had reduced its estimated life cycle cost to $3.2B and that the Phase B decision was on track for completion on April 11, 2018.\n\nThe Trump administration's proposed FY2019 budget would terminate WFIRST, citing higher priorities within NASA and the increasing cost of this telescope. The proposed cancellation of the project was met with criticism by professional astronomers, who noted that the American astronomical community had rated WFIRST the highest-priority space mission for the 2020s in the 2010 Decadal Survey. The American Astronomical Society expressed \"grave concern\" about the proposed cancellation, and noted that the estimated lifecycle cost for WFIRST had not changed over the previous two years. However, on March 22-23, Congress approved a FY18 WFIRST budget in excess of the administration's budget request for that year and stated that Congress \"rejects the cancellation of scientific priorities recommended by the National Academy of Sciences decadal survey process\", and further directed NASA to develop new estimates of WFIRST’s total and annual development costs. Later, the President announced he had signed the bill March 23.\n\nSpace agencies from four nations and regions, namely CNES, DLR, ESA, and JAXA are currently in discussion with NASA to provide various components and science support for WFIRST. NASA has expressed interest in ESA contributions to the spacecraft, coronagraph and ground station support. For the coronagraph instrument, contributions from Europe and Japan are being discussed. A contribution from Germany's Max Planck Institute for Astronomy is under consideration, namely the filter wheels for the star-blocking mask inside the coronagraph. The Japanese space agency JAXA is proposing to add an polarization module for the coronagraph, plus a polarization compensator. An accurate polarimetry capability on WFIRST may strengthen the science case for exoplanets and planetary disks, which shows polarization. In addition to these potential partnerships, Australia has offered ground station contributions for the mission.\n\nIn May 2018, NASA awarded a multi-year contract to Ball Aerospace to provide key components for the Wide Field Instrument on WFIRST. In June 2018, NASA awarded a contract to Teledyne Scientific and Imaging to provide the infrared detectors for the Wide Field Instrument. On November 30, 2018 NASA announced it had awarded the contract for Optical Telescope Assembly.\n\n"}

Much of his work is focused on the body. He repeatedly links the attractive with the repulsive, creating work that holds within it inherent contradictions – one does not know whether to stare, be seduced, or to look away. As the critic Robert Enright wrote in the art magazine \"Border Crossings\", \"Delvoye is involved in a way of making art that reorients our understanding of how beauty can be created\". Wim Delvoye has an eclectic oeuvre, exposing his interest in a range of themes, from bodily function, and scatology to the function of art in the current market economy, and numerous subjects in between. He lives and works in Brighton, UK.\n\nDelvoye was raised in Wervik, a small town in West Flanders, Belgium. He did not have a religious upbringing but has been influenced by the Roman Catholic architecture that surrounded him. In a conversation with Michaël Amy of the \"New York Times\", Delvoye stated, \"I have vivid memories of crowds marching behind a single statue as well as of people kneeling in front of painted and carved altarpieces… Although I was barely aware of the ideas lurking behind these types of images, I soon understood that paintings and sculptures were of great importance\".\n\nGrowing up, Delvoye attended exhibitions with his parents, and his love of drawing eventually led him to art school, the Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Ghent). Delvoye has said that the pessimistic expectations for Belgian art students freed him, essentially making him realize that he “had nothing to lose”. Shortly thereafter, Delvoye began painting over wallpaper and carpets, coloring in the existing patterns and defying the tendency towards free expression vibrant in the art world at the time.\n\nDelvoye considers himself an originator of concepts—he is attracted initially to the theory behind pieces, instead of the act of painting itself. After 1990, specialists directed by Delvoye have executed most of his work. In 1992, Delvoye received international recognition with the presentation of his “Mosaic” at Documenta IX, a symmetrical display of glazed tiles featuring photographs of his own excrement. The organizer of Documenta IX, Jan Hoet claimed, “The strength of Wim Delvoye lies in his ability to engineer conflict by combining the fine arts and folk art, and playing seriousness against irony.” Three of his most well known projects are “Cloaca”, “Art Farm”, and a series of Gothic works.\n\nDelvoye is perhaps best known for his digestive machine, \"Cloaca\", which he unveiled at the Museum voor Hedendaagse Kunst, Antwerp, after eight years of consultation with experts in fields ranging from plumbing to gastroenterology. As a comment on the Belgians’ love of fine dining, \"Cloaca\" is a large installation that turns food into feces, allowing Delvoye to explore the digestive process. In his large mechanism, food begins at a long, transparent bowl (mouth), travels through a number of machine-like assembly stations, and ends in hard matter which is separated from liquid through a cylinder. Delvoye collects and sells the realistically smelling output, suspended in small jars of resin at his Ghent studio. When asked about his inspiration, Delvoye stated that everything in modern life is pointless. The most useless object he could create was a machine that serves no purpose at all, besides the reduction of food to waste. \"Cloaca\" has appeared in many incarnations including: \"Cloaca Original\", \"Cloaca - New & Improved\", \"Cloaca Turbo\", \"Cloaca Quattro\", \"Cloaca N° 5\", and \"Personal Cloaca\". Delvoye also sold specially printed toilet paper as a souvenir of the exhibit. In 2016, 5 rolls from the 2007 Mudam Luxembourg exhibit were offered for re-sale for US$300 through an online vendor.\n\nPreviously, Delvoye claimed that he would never sell a \"Cloaca\" machine to a museum as he could never trust that the curator would maintain the installation properly. However, after two years of discussion with David Walsh, Delvoye agreed to construct a custom \"Cloaca\" built specifically for the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Tasmania. The new installation is suspended from the museum ceiling in a room custom-built for it.\n\nThough Delvoye started tattooing pig skins taken from slaughterhouses in the United States in 1992, he began to tattoo live pigs in 1997. Delvoye was interested in the idea that “the pig would literally grow in value,\" both in a physical and economic sense. He ultimately moved the operation to an Art Farm in China in 2004. The pigs have been inked with a diverse array of designs, including the trivial, such as skulls and crosses, to Louis Vuitton designs, to designs dictated by the pig's anatomy\". In an interview with \"ArtAsiaPacific's\" Paul Laster, Delvoye described the process of tattooing a live pig, \"we sedate it, shave it and apply Vaseline to its skin\".\n\nDelvoye is additionally well known for his “gothic” style work. In 2001, Delvoye, with the help of a radiologist, had several of his friends paint themselves with small amounts of barium, and perform explicit sexual acts in medical X-ray clinics. He then used the X-ray scans to fill gothic window frames instead of classic stained glass. Delvoye suggests that radiography reduces the body to a machine. When he was not an active participant, Delvoye observed from a computer screen in another room, allowing the subjects enough distance to perform normally, although Delvoye has described the whole operation as \"very medical, very antiseptic\". Delvoye also creates oversized laser-cut steel sculptures of objects typically found in construction (like a cement truck), customized in seventeenth-century Flemish Baroque style. These structures juxtapose \"medieval craftsmanship with Gothic filigree\". Delvoye brings together the heavy, brute force of contemporary machinery and the delicate craftsmanship associated with Gothic architecture.\n\nIn a 2013 show in New York City, Delvoye showed intricate laser-cut works combining architectural and figurative references with shapes such as a Möbius band or a Rorschach inkblot.\n\n\n"}
