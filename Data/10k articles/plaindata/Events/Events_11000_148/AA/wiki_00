The Philadelphia Warriors of the Eastern Division faced the Chicago Stags of the Western Division for the inaugural championship, with Philadelphia having home court advantage. Hall of Fame inductee Joe Fulks played for the Warriors in the series. Following the 1948–49 season (the BAA's third season of play), the BAA and the National Basketball League merged to create the National Basketball Association.\n\nPhiladelphia was not the Eastern Division champion but advanced to the championship round by winning a four-team playoff among the Eastern and Western Division runners-up. Meanwhile, the Eastern and Western Division champions, Washington Capitols and Chicago Stags, played one long series to determine the other finalist, a best-of-seven series that Chicago won 4–2. In the runners-up bracket, Philadelphia and New York from the East had first eliminated St. Louis and Chicago from the West, then faced each other, all in best-of-three series. The format was repeated in 1948, and generated another champion from the runners-up bracket.\n\nThe five games of the final series were played in seven days, with no days off between consecutive games in the same city (twice). Division champions Washington and Chicago had played the six games of their semifinal series from April 2 to 13, although they too took no days off between consecutive games in the same city (twice). In total, the entire playoff tournament lasted a total of 20 days.\n\n\"Warriors win series 4–1\"\n\nAround 7,900 people attended Game 1. The Warriors led at halftime 34–20. Fulks then scored 29 points in the second half, including 21 in the fourth quarter. Angelo Musi, a guard out of Temple University, scored 19 points himself for Philadelphia as well. The Stags took an astounding 129 shots, but only knocked down 26 of them, a 20.2 shooting percentage which made it easy for the Warriors to win, 84–71.\n\nFulks was not the scorer he was in Game 1, but he did not have to be, because five other Warrior players scored in double figures, including 18 points from forward Howie Dallmar and 16 from guard/forward Fleishman. Chicago did take a brief 69-68 lead until Philadelphia center Art Hillhouse came alive in the fourth quarter. He scored 7 out of the last 10 points for the Warriors, en route to a second Philadelphia win, 85–74.\n\nWith less than a minute remaining, Dallmar snapped an 80–80 tie by nailing a jump shot to seal the very first championship for the Warriors.\n\n"}

One small building was set on fire during the incident and several people were injured.\nThe Iranian government publicly condemned the violence.\n\nThe British government had imposed numerous sanctions on Iran regarding concerns over the nature of Iran's nuclear program. Following the release of a November 2011 International Atomic Energy Agency report that documented weaponisation elements of Iran's nuclear activities, the British government banned all financial institutions in the United Kingdom doing business with their counterparts in Iran, including Iran's central bank. Iran responded by approving a bill to downgrade its ties with the United Kingdom, including a requirement for both countries to withdraw their respective ambassadors. This was not the first time that Iran has called for downgrading ties with the United Kingdom.\n\nAbout 1,000 people gathered near the embassy to demand that the British ambassador be sent home immediately. The rally began quietly, but some participants stormed the building, breaking down the door, throwing around papers and replacing the British flag with an Iranian one. The Iranian security forces initially did not intervene as protesters entered the British Embassy. Protesters removed the mission's flag and ransacked offices. The protesters chanted, \"Death to America\", \"Death to England\" and \"Death to Israel\", among other slogans.\n\nAccording to the British Ambassador to Iran Dominick Chilcott, protesters rampaged through the embassy building, destroying paintings and furniture, spraying graffiti, smashing windows and starting fires. Seven embassy staff were seized by protesters but were eventually escorted out by police. The protesters also stole mobile phones and computers.\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron described the incursion as \"outrageous and indefensible\" and demanded that Iran immediately ensure the safety of all British Embassy personnel. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the \"irresponsible action\" had put the safety of diplomats and their families at risk and caused extensive damage to embassy property. Some anti-UK students had gathered at the front of Gholhak Garden in the north of Tehran. They also pulled down a picture of the Queen and burned an embassy vehicle, as well as US, Israeli and UK flags. The protesters said they wanted to shut down the embassy. Protesters also targeted Gholhak Garden, a British diplomatic compound in northern Tehran whose ownership has been a source of contention between Iranian and UK officials. Iran expressed regret over the attacks and police arrested 12 protesters.\n\nIranian state media agencies and certain international news sources described the protests as a reaction of students against Britain's anti-Iran policies. The demonstrators themselves issued an official statement, declaring, \"Our actions are a spontaneous reaction of revolutionary students and were not ordered by any state organ.\"\n\nIn a statement to the House of Commons on 30 November, Foreign Secretary William Hague said: \"Iran is a country where Opposition leaders are under house arrest, more than 500 people have been executed so far this year and where genuine protest is ruthlessly stamped on. The idea that the Iranian authorities could not have protected our Embassy or that this assault could have taken place without some degree of regime consent is fanciful\".\n\nSome analysts, media sources and Iranian opposition groups assert that the attack was orchestrated by the Iranian authorities, hence the strong British reaction. Al Jazeera's correspondent in Tehran, Dorsa Jabbari, reported that the Iranian police and various ministries had prior knowledge of the protest, which was organised by the student arm of the Basij.\n\nPolice reportedly \"stood back and let the protestors make their way into the compound\". In the words of \"The Economist\", \"This was the centre of the capital city . . . If the police had wanted to stop this, they could have flooded the compound with officers and rescued the British. The police, and whoever was pulling the strings behind the attack, chose not to intervene for a long while\".\n\nJabbari stated, \"Any such action of this scale can never be independent in the Islamic Republic\". Dominick Chilcott told the BBC, Iran is a country in which such action is only taken \"with the acquiescence and the support of the state\".\n\nThe École Française de Téhéran (Tehran's French school) is located on property of the British embassy. It had its classes in session as the embassy attack occurred. Several windows at the German Embassy School Tehran (DBST), near the British embassy, were destroyed, and the French school, the German school, and the British School of Tehran (BST) closed indefinitely. The school board of trustees of the BST voted to have the school permanently disestablished, with the end date being 31 December 2011. The DBST acquired the assets of the BST and established an international section in the former BST buildings.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry expressed regret over the attack, calling it \"unacceptable\" and said that it happened \"despite the efforts made by the Iranian Law Enforcement Police and reinforcement of the embassy guards\". Iranian police arrested 12 protesters in connection with the attack.\n\nTwo Iranian opposition student groups, Tahkim Vahdat and Advar Tahkim, issued statements criticising the attack. Tahkim Vahdat said that those behind it were \"not true representative of Iranian students, they were affiliated with the authorities in power\".\n\nIran's Deputy Police Chief Brigadier General Ahmad Reza Radan announced that police have started investigations into the details of the protests, in which angry self-driven protesters raided and occupied the British embassy and its garden in Northern Tehran.\n\nIranian MP Parviz Sorouri, a senior member of the Majlis National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said that \"the British government's hasty decision to close down the Iranian Embassy in London has created a new situation for both sides. But the Iranian government will do its utmost to stand up for the rights of Iranian citizens living in Britain through the establishment of an interests section in London\".\nSubsequently, the Sultanate of Oman agreed to act as a protecting power, representing the interests of Iran through its embassy in London.\n\nFollowing the incident, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office issued a statement saying that \"we are outraged by this. It is utterly unacceptable and we condemn it\". Later that evening David Cameron described the Iranian Government's failure to protect the embassy as a \"disgrace\". On 30 November 2011, during a speech to the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary William Hague announced that the Iranian Ambassador to the Court of St. James's, his ambassadorial staff and other Iranian diplomats had 48 hours to leave the United Kingdom. The foreign secretary also announced that he had closed the British Embassy, and its staff and dependants had left Tehran. This brought the United Kingdom's relations with Iran to their lowest level, and both the Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister had warned of far more \"serious consequences\" towards Iran, for its failure to uphold its international obligations in line with the Vienna Convention.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told the BBC's Sarah Rainsford that the UK's relationship with Iran had \"taken a very serious knock\" but that \"It doesn't mean we're cutting off all diplomatic relations with Iran. It doesn't mean we are in any way lessening our determination to try to find a diplomatic solution to the nuclear question, which is immensely important to Europe and the whole world, and we will continue to work tirelessly to find a negotiated solution\".\n\nIn November 2013, Iran and the UK agreed to end the protecting power arrangements of Sweden and Oman and appointed non-resident \"charge d'affaires\" to conduct bilateral relations between London and Tehran. \nIn June 2014, the UK announced that it intended to reopen its embassy in Tehran once practical arrangements had been completed and predicted that Iran would reopen its embassy in London.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council condemned the attacks \"in the strongest terms\".\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described the attacks as an \"affront\" to the international community. US Vice-President Joe Biden said he had no evidence the attack on the British embassy in Tehran was orchestrated by Iranian authorities, but it was another example of why the country was a \"pariah\".\n\nFrance, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands recalled their ambassadors to discuss the diplomatic matter, with Austria stating they are considering a similar decision.\n\nWhile not recalling its own ambassador, Sweden summoned the Iranian Ambassador to the Swedish Foreign Ministry. Germany offered to act as a protecting power for the United Kingdom's diplomatic duties in Iran; Sweden took on those diplomatic duties as of July 2012. Hungary declined to recall its Ambassador to Iran following a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on 1 December, saying it would cripple normal day-to-day operations due to its limited staff. However the Hungarian government joined its European allies in condemning the incident.\n\nRussia condemned the attack, stating that the actions were \"unacceptable and deserve condemnation\". China did not criticise Iran by name but stated that \"the relevant action runs counter to international law and basic norms of international relations and should be handled appropriately.\"\n\nOn 7 September 2012, Canada closed its embassy in Iran and declared all remaining Iranian diplomats in Canada \"personae non gratae\", ordering them to leave the country within five days.\n\nIn August 2015, nearly four years after the closure of the British Embassy in Tehran, and only weeks after reaching a nuclear deal with Iran, it was announced by Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in a joint press conference with British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond at the Foreign Ministry in Tehran that the embassy will be reopened as soon as possible. The new round of relations between the two nations are on the account of the JCPOA and in anticipation of strategic relations in the course of coming years. However, a number of Iranian students and people protested against the reopening of the British embassy on Sunday morning in the presence of Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond according to Fars News Agency. \n\n\n"}

Leading the nominees were Justin Timberlake and Macklemore & Ryan Lewis with six, followed by Bruno Mars, Miley Cyrus, and Robin Thicke with four. Justin Timberlake was the big winner on the night with four awards, including Video of the Year for \"Mirrors\" and the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Bruno Mars and Taylor Swift were also among the winners of the night. The ceremony drew a total of 10.1 million viewers.\n\nThe show featured Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke's raunchy and sexually-driven performance for the medley of their songs \"We Can't Stop\" and \"Blurred Lines\", which received negative reactions from critics and mixed reactions from fans and fellow celebrities. The most watched performance of the night was Justin Timberlake's 15-minute medley number, which included a mini-reunion with NSYNC, leading up to his acceptance speech for the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.\n\n\nList of presenters:\n\nNominees were announced on July 17, 2013.

The performance began with Cyrus performing \"We Can't Stop\" in bear-themed attire. Following this, Thicke entered the stage and Cyrus stripped down to a skin-colored two-piece latex outfit while they performed \"Blurred Lines\" in a duet. Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant pedicured foam finger and twerked against him.\n\nAn article published in \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described the performance as \"crass\" and \"reminiscent of a bad acid trip\". The performance was described by \"XXL\" critic B. J. Steiner as a \"trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment\", while the BBC said Cyrus stole the show with a \"raunchy performance\". Katy Kroll of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine wrote in 2014, \"there were dancing teddy bears, an overused foam finger, an unflattering flesh-colored bikini, some very obvious groping and twerking – lots and lots of twerking. For lack of a better term, it was a hot mess.\" A \"Telegraph\" article described Cyrus' actions as her going into \"overdrive [...] trying to kill off her Disney millstone, \"Hannah Montana\"\".\n\nThe performance generated 306,100 tweets per minute on Twitter, Cyrus' performance resulted in a gain of over 213,000 Twitter followers, 226,000 likes on Facebook, and 90,000 downloads of her new single, \"Wrecking Ball\", within days of the controversial performance. This amounted to a total 112% increase in Cyrus' social media activity. The performance topped Twitter during the East Coast telecast, with Timberlake behind with 219,800 tweets per minute at its peak. The most-mentioned performers on Twitter were Cyrus (4.5 million), Timberlake (2.9 million) and Lady Gaga (1.9 million).\n\n"}

The company developed many long-haul fiber optic routes, primarily along railroad rights of way, consisting of both dark fiber and lit fiber. These long-haul routes included Chicago to New Orleans, Chicago to Denver, Chicago to Detroit, Chicago to New York, Seattle to Los Angeles, and Denver to San Francisco. In 2011, the company was acquired by Zayo Group.\n\nThe company was founded as Pacific Fiber Link, L.L.C. on February 5, 1998 as a subsidiary of Ledcor Industries of Canada, a member of the Ledcor Group of Companies, owned by the Lede family. It commenced business operations on May 31, 1998.\n\nAs the fiber optic telecommunications industry boomed, one of the greatest impediments to rapid growth for the telecoms was the acquisition of the rights of way within which to lay the fiber optic cables. The Ledes came up with a solution to this problem and negotiated a deal with the Canadian National Railway to install the cable in the railroad's rights of way alongside the tracks. The company made significant contributions to the linear construction industry by inventing and patenting the Railplow, that is mounted on a flatbed railcar and used to rapidly excavate a trench alongside railroad tracks, install conduits used for housing fiber optic cables, then backfilling the trench and completing the construction and installation process within a very short span of time. This technology enabled 360networks to rapidly lay out a North American fiber optic network throughout Canada and the United States along and within numerous railroad rights of way. The patent for the Railplow was transferred to a subsidiary of the two companies and 360networks received a royalty-free, exclusive license for the use of the Railplow, giving it a significant advantage over some of its competitors that also utilized rail corridors.\n\nInitially, the company focused on building a fiber optic route from Seattle to Sacramento. In 1999, it changed its name to Worldwide Fiber Networks, Inc. and its focus toward a global network. \n\nNot long thereafter, the company again changed its name to 360networks (USA), Inc., to better describe its 360-degree focus on a global network.\n\nGreg Maffei, the former chief financial officer of Microsoft, was hired as the chief executive officer of the company.\n\nThe company received investments from Michael Dell, Nathan Myhrvold, Liberty Media, and News Corp.\n\nIn April 2000, during the dot-com bubble, the company became a public company via an initial public offering, raising C$2.4 billion (US$1.45 billion) and giving the company a market capitalization of C$20.6 billion.\n\nIn May 2000, the company acquired 1 million square feet of space to house computer networking equipment in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Dallas for $144 million in cash and stock.\n\nIn August 2000, the company acquired 11,000 miles of fiber optic infrastructure from Call-Net Enterprises Incorporated for $162.5 million.\n\nIn November 2000, the company had a market capitalization of $13 billion, despite only $234 million in revenue for the first six months of 2000.\n\nIn May 2001, the company received a license to own infrastructure in Japan.\n\nIn early June 2001, the company skipped a debt payment.\n\nOn June 28, 2001, the company filed bankruptcy in Canada and the United States.\n\nIn October 2002, WL Ross & Co acquired 12.5% of the company.\n\nIn November 2002, the company emerged from bankruptcy. The company also acquired Group Telecom.\n\nIn May 2003, the company acquired the U.S. communications business of Dynegy. \n\nIn November 2003, the company sold assets to Qwest.\n\nIn January 2004, the company bought the assets of Touch America out of bankruptcy.\n\nIn May 2004, the company sold its Canadian assets to Bell Canada for C$275 million.\n\nIn July 2005, Greg Maffei vacated his position as CEO to work for Oracle Corporation, but remained chairman.\n\nIn December 2011, the company was acquired by Zayo Group.\n"}

Alabama Together spent months repeatedly reaching out to Representative Rogers, sending emails, writing letters, making calls, and leaving messages with his local and D.C. offices. Alabama Together offered five meeting-date options during the congressional recess and offered to send the questions ahead of time, but Representative Rogers refused to acknowledge the invitation. The forum continued in his absence, and residents and voters addressed a video camera with their concerns about Representative Rogers' failure to represent the interests of his constituents. Representative Rogers refused to participate in a similar event in Montgomery in February 2017.\n\nAlabama Together helps organize political marches, including a March for Science, in Auburn, Alabama in April 2017.

The main event of the show saw Dragón Rojo, Jr. defend the CMLL World Middleweight Championship against NWA World Historic Welterweight Champion La Sombra. The event commemorated the completion of Arena Coliseo on April 2, 1943, built by CMLL owner and founder Salvador Lutteroth. The show aired live on the Mexican television channel Terra.\n\nThe event featured six professional wrestling matches, in which some wrestlers are involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines and others are teamed up with no particular backstory leading up to the match. Wrestlers themselves portray either villains (referred to as \"\"Rudos\" in Mexico) or fan favorites (\"Tecnicos\"\" in Mexico) as they compete in matches with pre-determined outcomes.\n\nprofessional wrestling promoter Salvador Lutteroth began promoting wrestling, or \"Lucha libre\" events in Arena Modelo in 1933 as he founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL). The building served as the main venue for Lutteroth's promotion from 1933 until the early 1940s when the success of \"Lucha Libre\" meant that Arena Model was becoming too small to accommodate the weekly shows. Lutteroth financed the building of a new arena with $40,000 that he had won in the national lottery. The building would sit on the location of \"República de Perú\" 77 in the Cuauhtémoc and was designed by Architect Francisco Bullman. Upon its completion in 1943 it was the first sports building in Mexico to have built in Air Conditioning. The building would hold 8,863 spectators for wrestling or boxing events and quickly gained the nickname the \"Lagunilla Funnel\" due to the design of the spectators stands in regards to the ring in the middle. The venue began hosting Boxing events only a few months after opening and for years would run both wrestling and boxing events throughout the year. The venue served as the main building for EMLL, hosting their Anniversary shows starting with their 10th Anniversary show in 1943 through their 22nd Anniversary show in 1955. From 1956 and forward Arena Coliseo became a secondary venue for EMLL, with the newly constructed Arena México taking over as the venue for all of EMLL's major shows. In 1979, for unknown reasons EMLL held their 46th Anniversary Show in Arena Coliseo instead of Arena México, marking the last major EMLL event held there. In the weeks leading up to the 70th anniversary of Arena Coliseo CMLL began promoting the history of the arena, detailing its rich history of both boxing and wrestling as well as its role in Women's wrestling in Mexico, the championship matches that had taken place in the arena over the years and the large number of \"Luchas de Apuestas\" matches that had taken place on the premises and finally the deaths of boxers and wrestlers in the actual arena.\n\nThe main event of the show would see reigning CMLL World Middleweight Champion Dragón Rojo, Jr. defend his championship against challenger La Sombra in a Best two-out-of three falls match. The two wrestlers had faced off multiple times in the past, most recently on January 20, 2013 during a CMLL/New Japan Pro Wrestling co-promoted show in Japan called \"Fantastica Mania\" 2013. During the show La Sombra won the NWA World Historic Welterweight Championship from Dragón Rojo, Jr.\n\nThe fourth and fifth match of the show featured matches contested under best two-out-of-three falls six-man tag team rules and in each case featured one team representing CMLL and one team representing \"Los Independientes\", or the Independent circuit that were not under contract with CMLL. Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. had worked CMLL's 2013 \"Homenaje a Dos Leyendas\" only a few weeks earlier, against Universo 2000 and the two independent, \"old school\" wrestlers found themselves on opposite sides once again. Rayo teamed up with CMLL regulars Atlantis and Diamante Azul while Universo 2000 teamed up with his brother Máscara Año 2000 and Ray Mendoza, Jr. On February 21, 2013, CMLL held a press conference to officially announce that the \"Homenaje a Dos Leyendas\" would pay tribute to Rayo de Jalisco (\"The Lighting from Jalisco\") and brought out Rayo's son, Rayo de Jalisco, Jr., as part of the announcement. Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. had not worked for CMLL since 2010 but made a special appearance due to the company honoring his father. During the press conference Rayo de Jalisco, Jr.'s long time rival Universo 2000 interrupted Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. and the two ended up challenging each other to a match that would take place at the 2013 \"Homenaje a Dos Leyendas\", although the exact nature of the match was not announced at the time. The rivalry between the two wrestlers hailed back to at least 1997 where Universo 2000 defeated both Cien Caras and Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. to win the CMLL World Heavyweight Championship. After being masked since his debut in 1985 Universo 2000 lost a \"Lucha de Apuesta\" match to El Canek in the main event of the 71st Anniversary Show, on September 17, 2004, the match also included Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. and Dr. Wagner, Jr. and originally came about due to the Universo 2000/Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. rivalry. Following his unmasking Universo 2000 won the 2004 \"Leyenda de Azul\" (Blue legend tournament). In subsequent years both Universo 2000 and Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. left CMLL. In 2005 Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. suffered another serious injury, he injured both his knees in a match against Universo 2000's brother Máscara Año 2000, where his legs got caught on the ropes as he jumped out of the ring and he tore ligaments in both knees. The injury kept him out of the ring for almost half a year but in the end Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. was able to make a full recovery and return to the ring. The incident was used by several promoters as well as Rayo de Jalisco, Jr. himself to create more interest in matches between himself and Universo 2000, Cien Caras and Máscara Año 2000.At the \"Homenaje a Dos Leyendas\" show Rayo de Jalisco, Jr., Shocker, and Rush defeated the team of Universo 2000, Mr. Niebla and El Terrible by disqualification when Universo 2000 cheated. Ray Mendoza, Jr.'s appearance at the show was the subject of some controversy as he had held an official Retirement show a few weeks before, only to show up at the special CMLL event. He later explained that his poorly attended retirement show had ended up costing him $38,000 of his own money and thus felt he was forced to work this match to make some of the money back that he had lost.\n\nThe fourth match of the night would feature CMLL wrestlers Averno, Blue Panther, and Shocker team up to take on the \"Old-school\" team of Black Terry, Negro Navarro, and Villano IV. This match did not have a particular backstory, instead it paired up some CMLL wrestlers who were said to be working the classical mat style wrestling, especially Blue Panther, with three independent circuit workers who worked the same style of wrestling. The third match of the night was an all-female \"torneo cibernetico\" elimination match where the last women in the ring would be awarded the \"Trofeo Arena Coliseo 70 Aniversario\" cup. The match had the \"tecnica\" team of Marcela, Estrellita, Goya Kong, Dalys La Caribeña and Silueta take on the \"ruda\" team of La Amapola, Princesa Sugey, Princesa Blanca, Zeuxis, Tiffany. Estrellita and La Amapola had been on opposite sides of a long running feud that led to a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match between the two at the 2013 \"Homenaje a Dos Leyendas\" show two weeks prior. The match was won by Estrellita and La Amapola was forced to have all her hair shaved off after the match. The Arena Coliseo 70th Anniversary Show marked the first time the two faced off since the \"Apuestas\" match. The second match of the night centered on the rivalry between Metálico and El Hijo del Signo as they were on opposite sides of a six-man tag team match. Metálico teamed up with fellow \"tecnicos\"Hombre Bala, Jr. and Super Halcón, Jr. while Hijo del Signo partnered up with Nosferatu and Taurus for the match. El Hijo del Signo had begun targeting the masked Metálico in the week prior to the show, playing up the brash, arrogant rookie character that he portrayed, stating that Metálico was simply too old and useless. During their matches against each other Hijo del Signo would often go out of his way to attack Metálico, often tearing Metálico's mask apart or using other underhanded tactics to win. The opening match was announced as rookie \"tecnicos\" Oro, Jr. and Soberano, Jr. would take on Espanto, Jr. and Guerrero Negro, Jr., with all four wrestlers being part of the \"Generacion\" 2012 class of wrestlers to graduate from the CMLL wrestling school.\n\nDuring the show CMLL officials gave an award to one of the fans in attendance as he had also attended the first Arena Coliseo show 70 years prior. Oro, Jr. was originally announced for the opening match, but was replaced by Metatrón later on without any explanation given. Metatrón and Soberano, Jr. defeated Espanto, Jr. and Guerrero Negro, Jr. two falls to one. During the second match of the night the storyline between Hijo del Signo and Metálico took center stage as most of the action centered on the two. In the second fall Hijo del Signo pulled Metálico's mask off, hoping to use the distraction to gain a pinfall, but instead he was disqualified when the referee saw the blatant rulebreaking by El Hijo del Signo.\n\nThe independent wrestlers were well received by the Arena Coliseo crowd, cheering especially for the portions of the match where Blue Panther and Negro Navarro wrestled against each other. The match ended when Averno forced Black Terry to submit and Blue Panther forced Villano IV to submit to win the third fall. Afterwards the fans showed their appreciation of the match by throwing money into the ring, causing both Panther and Navarro to actually go into the seats to collect more money after the match. Both Panther and Navarro teased that they were going to continue to fight, which drew a favorable response from the crowd. Before the fifth match of the night Ray Mendoza, Jr. took the microphone and announced to the crowd that this would actually be his last match as a professional wrestler. Rayo de Jalisco and his team won both the second and third fall to win the entire match. In the main event the challenger La Sombra and the champion Dragón Rojo, Jr. quickly split the first two falls between them, tied up at 1–1. The third fall was longer than both the previous falls combined and finally saw Dragón Rojo, Jr. successfully defend the championship when he forced La Sombra to submit.\n"}

Alyssa Milano and Jack Scalia played the main characters in this movie for CBS. The movie aired the same night and time as ABC's movie, \"The Amy Fisher Story\", though ABC's movie was much higher rated in the TV ratings and critically praised.\n\nPhyllis Lyons, Leo Rossi, and Lawrence Tierney portrayed Buttafuoco's relatives.\n\nSet on Long Island, the film opens with Joey Buttafuoco (Jack Scalia) playing drums, driving under influence of cocaine, fleeing from the cops and visiting his mother's grave. At home, his wife Mary Jo (Phyllis Lyons) awaits his return, disappointed in his drug back lapse. After she threatens to leave him if he does not quit using drugs, Joey decides to enter rehab. Six weeks later, he is a renewed man, promising his wife he is now the person again she fell in love with. Three years later, in the summer of 1991, he works in an auto repair shop, and meets 17-year-old Amy Fisher (Alyssa Milano), who begs Joey to repair her car without telling her parents. Joey agrees, even though he is a close acquaintance of her father Elliot (Jack Kehler). Amy frequently crashes her car, prompting her to make multiple visits to Joey. It does not take long before she starts coming on to him, making hints of her promiscuous past despite her young age. Even though he does not respond to her affection, Joey does not especially push her away and constantly pays her special attention.\n\nOne day at the carnival with her friend Lizzy (Georgia Emelin), Amy notices Joey and surprises him with a kiss. Joey is startled and immediately leaves. After he is gone, Amy claims to Lizzy that she has been dating him for a while now. The next day, Joey finds out that Elliot has filed a complaint with the police after Amy has claimed that Joey gave her herpes. Joey sets out to the Fisher residence to set things straight, and Amy eventually admits that she lied about the situation. Joey is outraged, though does not inform his wife, fearing that it will affect their marriage. Later, at a cafe, Joey assures Amy that he has no interest in leaving his wife and children, and ignores her when she shows to him that she is wearing his car repair shop t-shirt. By now, Amy is madly in love with Joey and thinks that the only thing holding them apart is Mary Jo. She hires a contract killer to kill Mary Jo - paying him $600 and allowing him to sleep with her - though the young man eventually chickens out.\n\nSix months later, she shows up at the Buttafuoco residence once again and claims to Mary Jo that Joey is having an affair with her \"16-year-old sister\", showing him Joey's car repair shop t-shirt to \"prove\" her claim. When Mary Jo refuses to believe her, Amy takes out her gun and shoots Mary Jo in the head. Later at the hospital, Joey is informed that his wife's situation is critical and that she might be paralyzed for the rest of her life, if she does not die. Amy, meanwhile, sets out to her boyfriend Paul (Michael Bowen), who is in a relationship with another woman, for comfort. Back in the hospital, a severely injured Mary Jo informs Joey and the detectives that her attacker owned his repair shop t-shirt. Joey then realizes Amy shot Mary Jo. Following her arrest, Amy claims that she and Joey both conspired to kill Mary Jo, enabling them to spend their life together. Joey denies any of Amy's claims, and swears to the cops that he was never involved with her. In the media, Joey is frequently mentioned as an adulterer and conspirer, causing even Mary Jo to question her husband.\n\nEven though he is advised to not set out to the media, Joey decides to make an official report after the media releases a sex tape of Amy and an older man. It is claimed that Joey forced her into a life of prostitution, and that the older man of the tape was one of her clients. In prison, Amy continues to make love claims to Joey, now through letters. During the court case, Amy's bail is set at $2 million, the highest in New York state history, and Joey is tarnished by reporters. He tries to stand by his wife, but Mary Jo is confused by all the \"evidence\" that's coming up in court, \"proving\" Joey is guilty. She blames him for not being able to protect her, though she does not leave him.\n\nBy August 1992, bail for Amy is made by a TV network working to adapt her story. Joey's life falls more apart when he is informed that the entire Buttafuoco family will lose the auto repair shop if it is proven that he had an affair with Amy (the pressure causes his father to have a heart attack). The Buttafuocos want to allow Amy to have a plea bargain, or else her attorney will destroy the family company. Even though Mary Jo objects to the situation, reminding her family that she is the victim here, Amy is allowed a deal in court: she will receive 5 to 15 years for \"reckless assault\". Pleas of \"attempted murder\" among others are dropped, so the D.A. can come after Joey Buttafuoco for statutory rape. Soon after, a video tape is released in which Amy brags about her plea, and asks Paul to marry her. The tape allows the Buttafuocos to clear their name, while Amy receives the maximum sentence of 15 years in prison.\n\n\nBy the time the film was first aired, \"Casualties of Love\" received a fair share of media attention, due to the film being one of three about Amy Fisher and Joey Buttafuoco to be aired on the same night by three different TV networks. Filming took place in November and December 1992, and the film was promoted as the TV version that told Joey Buttafuoco's side of the story. USA Network bought the film's rights in 1992, and commented on the production: \"This particular movie was very attractive. The topic is just so hot right now.\" \"Casualties of Love\" did not live up to a common television film budget of $2 million. Due to the popularity of its story, the film had a much higher budget.\n\nThe film was known for being Alyssa Milano's first \"adult role\" which shed her \"nice girl image\" she gained from appearing in \"Who's the Boss?\" from 1984 to 1992. The producers cast her after seeing her portrayal as a teenage prostitute in the independent film \"Where the Day Takes You\" (1992). Milano was very enthusiastic when she found out she got the role, saying: \"There's nothing grittier than playing Amy Fisher.\" On her character, Milano commented: \"Our version was the one from Joey Buttafuoco's point of view: That she was a lunatic. Since then, we've learned that his version wasn't all true. But it was really challenging to make her believable, because everybody had already seen her on TV and they knew what she looked like and how she moved. I think that movie was the least \"Alyssa\" of anything I've done.\" Of all the three Amy Fisher films, Milano was glad that she was picked for \"Casualties of Love\", because it was the one where Amy Fisher was portrayed the most as a \"psycho\", which allowed her to practice her acting skills.\n\nThe film was shot between November 23 and December 16, 1992.\n"}

In Ireland there are county and provincial competitions leading to the All-Ireland Fleadh. In Britain there are regional, then national stages of qualification for the All-Ireland. North America has two regional qualifying Fleadh Cheoil. The Mid-Atlantic Fleadh covers the Eastern Seaboard, eastern Canada and the Maritimes. The Midwest Fleadh covers the rest of North America from Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Atlanta and Detroit to San Francisco.\n\nCompetitions are divided into the following age categories: under 12, 12–15, 15–18, and over 18 (senior).\n\nThe first national festival of Irish traditional music was held in Mullingar in 1951. At its inaugural meeting in September 1951, CCÉ came up with the title of Fleadh Cheoil, aiming to make this a great national festival of traditional music. The fleadh has been held in many different venues.\n\nIn the years that followed, the number of would-be competitors grew so large that qualifying stages had to be arranged at county and provincial levels. Since then, Fleadh Nua (the new fleadh), Fleadh na Breataine (an All-Britain fleadh) and regional fleadhanna in Britain, and two major fleadhanna in the USA have also become annual CCÉ events.\n\nFrom its beginning, the goal of the Fleadh Cheoil was to establish standards in Irish traditional music through competition. The fleadh developed as a mainly competitive event, but it also included many concerts, , parades, and sessions.\n\nToday, nearly 55 years on, fleadhanna at each level provide a platform and a meeting place for the thousands of musicians, singers and dancers who carry on the tradition. Around 20,000 performers compete in fleadhanna each year.\n\nThe largest fleadh to date was 2013 in Derry, an event which attracted 430,000 people. This fleadh was notable as it was the first All-Ireland Fleadh to be staged in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe 2008 festival was held in Tullamore, County Offaly and attracted an estimated crowd of 250,000 people making it Ireland's largest festival, music or otherwise. The Fleadh came to Sligo in 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe 2016 festival was held in Ennis, County Clare and attracted an estimated crowd of 400,000 people over the nine days from 14 to 22 August. Among the visitors to the 2016 Fleadh was President Michael D Higgins, who went to school near Ennis. 10,000 musicians took part in 2016, with 6,000 of them participating in 180 All-Ireland competitions. An estimated €38 million was spent as 80,000 visitors were in Ennis at any one time. There were 28 concerts, with five held in the 2,000-seater Shannon Aerodome at Tim Smythe Park in the town. \nThe 2017 Fleadh Cheoil returned to Ennis from 13 to 21 August. The 2017 festival was opened by Michael Flatley, and over 450,000 people attended over nine days, peaking at 100,000 for the Saturday.\n\nAccording to CCÉ's official rules for 2005:\n\nThere are also competitions for the following ensembles: duet, trio, céilí band, instrumental group (), accordion band, pipe band, and miscellaneous ensemble.\n\nThe full rule set, which may change from year to year, is available from CCÉ web site in the Press Room section. Comhaltas has a constitution () in the Irish language.\n\nTowns and cities wishing to host Fleadh Cheoil na hÉireann must submit several applications to Ardchomhairle an Chomaltais – the highest committee within CCÉ. Certain members of the Ardchomhairle then inspect the applicant towns and the locations that have been proposed as competition venues, before coming to a final decision several weeks after the preceding fleadh, usually in September. Once a town has been chosen to host the Fleadh, it undertakes to host the festival for two consecutive years. However, Comhaltas has the right to deny any the successful town the Fleadh for the second year if poor venues, organisational problems, etc. are demonstrated on the town's first year of hosting. On 10 September 2011, the 2012 All-Ireland Fleadh Cheoil was awarded to Cavan, County Cavan, for the third year in succession. The other towns who applied for the 2012 festival were Ennis, County Clare; and Sligo, County Sligo. The Fleadh was held in Derry in 2013, the first time that it was held in Northern Ireland. One of the primary reasons for holding the Fleadh in Derry was due to that city being awarded the UK City of Culture for 2013. In 2014, it was confirmed that the Fleadh Cheoil would be held in Sligo for 2014 and 2015. Ennis hosted the Fleadh in August 2016 and 2017, with Drogheda hosting in 2018 and 2019.\n\n\n"}

There does not appear to be an exact definition for who the Horsemen are, but they are usually described as terrorists, drug dealers, pedophiles, and organized crime. Other sources use slightly different descriptions but generally refer to the same types of criminals. The term was coined by Timothy C. May in 1988, who referred to them as \"child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc.\" when discussing the reasons for limited civilian use of cryptography tools. Among the most famous of these is in the Cypherpunk FAQ, which states:\n\nThe term seems to be used less often in discussions about online criminal activity, but more often in discussions about the negative, or chilling effects such activity has had on regular users' daily experiences online.\nIt is also used frequently to describe the political tactic \"Think of the children\". A message from the same mailing list states:\n\nThe four supposed threats may be used all at once or individually, depending on the circumstances:\n\nIn 2013, the director of the Safe Internet League (a voluntary censorship group in Russia) claimed that pedophiles, perverts, drug dealers “and other creeps” were using the Tor anonymity software, as a reason why the software should be outlawed. This list did not mention terrorists or money-launderers directly, but did use the catch-all phrase \"other creeps\" that potentially includes them.\n\nIn 2015, the UK Conservative party claimed that their proposed “new communications data legislation will strengthen our ability to disrupt terrorist plots, criminal networks and organised child grooming gangs”, echoing the \"child pornographers, terrorists, drug dealers, etc.\" quote of Timothy C. May.\n\nLater in 2015, Gamma Group released a statement claiming that their surveillance technology is used \"against terrorist threats, drug cartels, other major organised crime, and paedophile rings.\" as justification for concerns that it was being used to target opposition politicians and media groups in Uganda. With money-laundering treated as a major organised crime, this quote matches very closely with the list given in the Cypherpunk FAQ.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "842990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=842990", "title": "Great Moon Hoax", "text": "Great Moon Hoax\n\nThe \"Great Moon Hoax\" refers to a series of six articles that were published in \"The Sun\", a New York newspaper, beginning on August 25, 1835, about the supposed discovery of life and even civilization on the Moon. The discoveries were falsely attributed to Sir John Herschel, one of the best-known astronomers of that time.\n\nThe story was advertised on August 21, 1835, as an upcoming feature allegedly reprinted from \"The Edinburgh Courant\". The first in a series of six was published four days later on August 25.\n\nThe headline read:\n\nThe articles described fantastic animals on the Moon, including bison, goats, unicorns, bipedal tail-less beavers and bat-like winged humanoids (\"Vespertilio-homo\"\") who built temples. There were trees, oceans and beaches. These discoveries were supposedly made with \"an immense telescope of an entirely new principle.\"\n\nThe author of the narrative was ostensibly Dr. Andrew Grant, the travelling companion and amanuensis of Sir John Herschel, but Grant was fictitious.\n\nEventually, the authors announced that the observations had been terminated by the destruction of the telescope, by means of the Sun causing the lens to act as a \"burning glass,\" setting fire to the observatory.\n\nAuthorship of the article has been attributed to Richard Adams Locke (1800–1871), a reporter who, in August 1835, was working for \"The Sun\". Locke publicly admitted to being the author in 1840, in a letter to the weekly paper \"New World\". Still, rumours persisted that others were involved. Two other men have been noted in connection with the hoax: Jean-Nicolas Nicollet, a French astronomer travelling in America at the time (though he was in Mississippi, not New York, when the Moon-hoax issues appeared), and Lewis Gaylord Clark, editor of \"The Knickerbocker\", a literary magazine. However, there is no good evidence to indicate that anyone but Locke was the author of the hoax.\n\nAssuming that Richard A. Locke was the author, his intentions were probably, first, to create a sensational story which would increase sales of \"The Sun\", and, second, to ridicule some of the more extravagant astronomical theories that had recently been published. For instance, in 1824, Franz von Paula Gruithuisen, professor of Astronomy at Munich University, had published a paper titled \"Discovery of Many Distinct Traces of Lunar Inhabitants, Especially of One of Their Colossal Buildings.\" Gruithuisen claimed to have observed various shades of color on the lunar surface, which he correlated with climate and vegetation zones. He also observed lines and geometrical shapes, which he felt indicated the existence of walls, roads, fortifications, and cities.\n\nHowever, a more direct object of Locke's satire was Rev. Thomas Dick, who was known as \"The Christian Philosopher\" after the title of his first book. Dick had computed that the Solar System contained 21,891,974,404,480 (21.9 trillion) inhabitants. In fact, the Moon alone, by his count, would contain 4,200,000,000 inhabitants. His writings were enormously popular in the United States, his fans including intellectual luminaries such as Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nAccording to legend, \"The Sun\"s circulation increased dramatically because of the hoax and remained permanently greater than before, thereby establishing \"The Sun\" as a successful paper. However, the degree to which the hoax increased the paper's circulation has certainly been exaggerated in popular accounts of the event. It was not discovered to be a hoax for several weeks after its publication and, even then, the newspaper did not issue a retraction.\n\nHerschel was initially amused by the hoax, noting that his own real observations could never be as exciting. He became annoyed later when he had to answer questions from people who believed the hoax was serious.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe claimed the story was a plagiarism of his earlier work \"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall.\" His editor at the time was Richard Adams Locke. He later published \"The Balloon-Hoax\" in the same newspaper.\n\nPoe had published his own Moon hoax in late June 1835, two months before the similar Locke Moon hoax, in the \"Southern Literary Messenger\" entitled \"Hans Phaall – A Tale,\" later republished as \"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall.\" The story was reprinted in the \"New York Transcript\" on September 2–5, 1835, under the headline \"Lunar Discoveries, Extraordinary Aerial Voyage by Baron Hans Pfaall.\" Poe described a voyage to the Moon in a hot-air balloon, in which Pfaall lives for five years on the Moon with lunarians and sends back a lunarian to earth. The Poe Moon hoax was less successful because of the satiric and comical tone of the account. Locke was able to upstage Poe and to steal his thunder. In 1846, Poe would write a biographical sketch of Locke as part of his series \"The Literati of New York City\" which appeared in \"Godey's Lady's Book\".\n\nThe hoax, as well as Poe's \"Hans Pfaall\", are mentioned by characters in Jules Verne's \"From the Earth to the Moon\".\n\nNate DiMeo's historical podcast \"The Memory Palace\" dedicated an episode to the Great Moon Hoax entitled \"The Moon in the Sun.\"\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Rugby School. His father was a Paymaster-Commander in the Royal Navy and he was great-grandson of Sir Henry Ayers, a Premier of South Australia for whom Ayers Rock was named. Fowler's family moved to Adelaide in South Australia in 1920, before returning to the UK in 1924 so Fowler could attend Rugby School. He returned to Australia in 1933, before enlisting in the Royal Australian Air Force in 1936, and then transferring to the Royal Air Force (RAF).\n\nFowler was granted a short-service commission in the RAF as a pilot officer on 19 February 1937. He was trained at No 6 Flying Training School at Netheravon before being posted to 3 Squadron on 22 May 1937. He then served as a fighter pilot with 615 Squadron commanded by Squadron Leader Joseph Kayll, flying the Gloster Gladiator. He joined the Squadron in October 1939 before converting to Hawker Hurricanes in May 1940.\n\nFowler and 615 Squadron arrived in France in November 1939 as part of the Air Component of the BEF. When the German invasion of the west commenced on 10 May 1940, the Squadron was still converting onto Hurricanes, although they were in action from the very start. Fowler made his first 'kill' on 12 May 1940 when he shot down a Bf 109. This was also the Squadron's first kill. He was credited with shooting down a Dornier Do 17 on 14 May 1940 as well, followed by another Bf 109 the next day. During the same engagement he was also shot down. He bailed out and landed in the Ardennes Forest where he met some French soldiers retreating from the front line. However the next day, 16 May, the group was surrounded and forced to surrender. As a result, Fowler became a prisoner of war.\n\nHe was promoted to flight lieutenant on 3 September 1940 whilst in captivity.\n\nFowler was sent to Dulag Luft transit camp at Oberursel before being transferred to Stalag Luft I at Barth, arriving there on 5 July 1940.\n\nBy November 1941, Fowler was acting as a distributor of Red Cross parcels. During his time in captivity Fowler had been making a bogus German uniform out of various bits of material and a civilian suit, smuggling them into the parcel office which was outside the main prisoners' compound. On 5 November 1941, he dressed in his bogus German uniform from the parcel office and climbed over the lightly guarded perimeter fence. Outside the camp he changed into his civilian suit. He managed to reach Sassnitz and attempted to stow away on a Swedish ship; but whilst at the docks he was arrested by a German policeman. He was returned to Stalag Luft I and sentenced to 14 days solitary confinement, before being transferred to the 'escape proof' camp Oflag IV-C at Colditz Castle, arriving on 1 December 1941.\n\nPete Tunstall claims that Fowler, whilst at Barth, was the first in WWII to use the term 'goons' to describe the guards, referencing a well-known comic strip. Tunstall claims the term caught like wildfire through all the prison camps in Germany. \"Goons up\" became a warning cry for approaching guards, \"goon boxes\" described the machine gun towers, any manmade uniforms used to escape were called \"goon skins,\" and their favourite recreation of winding the guards up become known as \"goon baiting.\"\n\nDuring his time at Colditz, Fowler took part in 'goon baiting', which involved harassing and annoying the German guards as much as possible, under the able direction of Douglas Bader. For this, Fowler - as many others - spent time in solitary confinement.\nDuring August 1942 an escape plan was prepared for a party of officers moving through a short tunnel which started in the German Stabsfeldwebel's (sergeant major) office located near the prisoner's sick quarters. The starting location was chosen because it was a place unlikely to be thoroughly searched. Fowler was involved from the outset. The prisoners picked the office's lock and over a few nights built a tunnel which led from under the Stabsfeldwebel's desk to a clothing store with access to the outside. The tunnel was partly constructed by Captain Pat Reid.\n\nFrom the clothing store the prisoners were to leave the castle disguised as a work party removing clothes from the store, four to be dressed as Polish orderlies, one disguised as a German officer, the other as a German NCO. The six officers were Fowler, Captain Lulu Lawton (British Army), Lieutenant Geoff Wardle (Royal Navy) and three Dutch officers, Lt Beitz, Lt Donkers and Lt Damiaen Joan van Doorninck. The escape took place on 9 September 1942. All went well as the six escapers and two assistants entered the office during the previous evening and opened up the tunnel. However, around midnight there was an alarm and the Germans searched the castle. Fortunately for the prisoners, the office door had been relocked and this satisfied the searchers that nobody had entered the office. After entering the clothing store the tunnel was sealed to allow later use (it was discovered the following day during the search for the missing officers). At 0730 the escape party left the store, timed to be shortly after the change of the German sentries; the idea being that the new sentries would be unaware of who had already entered the store. The party, led by van Doorninck (dressed as the German NCO), proceeded past several sentries and using a forged pass, left the castle unaccosted.\n\nOutside the camp the party changed into civilian clothes and separated, Fowler travelling with van Doornick. They travelled on foot to Penig (about 31 km) and from there by train to Plauen via Zwickau. They caught the train to Stuttgart where they stayed overnight in a small hotel. The next day they caught a train to Tuttlingen and walked to the Swiss border. En route they were stopped by an SS policeman, but their forged papers were sufficient to pass inspection. They crossed into Switzerland at 0130 on 13 September 1942, and were taken to the British legation at Bern. The other four escapers were recaptured close to Colditz.\n\nFowler left Switzerland on 25 January 1943 and with Major Ronald B. Littledale, who had escaped from Colditz with Pat Reid, travelled across unoccupied France into Spain on 30 January 1943. They were arrested by the Spanish authorities later the same day. They were taken to a military prison at Figueras and held in filthy and cramped conditions until 22 February 1943. They were then taken to the British Consul in Barcelona from where they travelled to Gibraltar, arriving on 25 March 1943. Fowler returned to the UK shortly afterwards.\n\nFor his successful escape, Fowler was awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 14 December 1943.\n\nOn reaching the UK, Fowler was promoted to squadron leader, and posted to the Armament Test Squadron at Boscombe Down to act as a test pilot. He was killed during an air test flying a Hawker Typhoon on 26 March 1944, and was buried at Durrington cemetery.\n\n"}
{"id": "5082226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5082226", "title": "Hindenburg disaster", "text": "Hindenburg disaster\n\nThe \"Hindenburg\" disaster occurred on May 6, 1937, in Manchester Township, New Jersey, United States. The German passenger airship LZ 129 \"Hindenburg\" caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at Naval Air Station Lakehurst. On board were 97 people (36 passengers and 61 crewmen); there were 36 fatalities (13 passengers and 22 crewmen, 1 worker on the ground).\n\nThe disaster was the subject of spectacular newsreel coverage, photographs, and Herbert Morrison's recorded radio eyewitness reports from the landing field, which were broadcast the next day. A variety of hypotheses have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The event shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era.\n\nAfter opening its 1937 season by completing a single round-trip passage to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in late March, the \"Hindenburg\" departed from Frankfurt, Germany, on the evening of May 3, on the first of 10 round trips between Europe and the United States that were scheduled for its second year of commercial service. American Airlines had contracted with the operators of the \"Hindenburg\" to shuttle the passengers from Lakehurst to Newark for connections to airplane flights.\n\nExcept for strong headwinds that slowed its progress, the Atlantic crossing of the \"Hindenburg\" was otherwise unremarkable until the airship attempted an early-evening landing at Lakehurst three days later on May 6. Although carrying only half its full capacity of passengers (36 of 70) and crewmen (61, including 21 crewman trainees) for the accident flight, the \"Hindenburg\" was fully booked for its return flight. Many of the passengers with tickets to Germany were planning to attend the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London the following week.\n\nThe airship was hours behind schedule when it passed over Boston on the morning of May 6, and its landing at Lakehurst was expected to be further delayed because of afternoon thunderstorms. Advised of the poor weather conditions at Lakehurst, Captain Max Pruss charted a course over Manhattan Island, causing a public spectacle as people rushed out into the street to catch sight of the airship. After passing over the field at 4:00 p.m., Captain Pruss took passengers on a tour over the seasides of New Jersey while waiting for the weather to clear. After finally being notified at 6:22 p.m. that the storms had passed, Pruss directed the airship back to Lakehurst to make its landing almost half a day late. However, as this would leave much less time than anticipated to service and prepare the airship for its scheduled departure back to Europe, the public was informed that they would not be permitted at the mooring location or be able to visit aboard the \"Hindenburg\" during its stay in port.\n\nAround 7:00 p.m. local time, at an altitude of , the \"Hindenburg\" made its final approach to the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. This was to be a high landing, known as a \"flying moor\", because the airship would drop its landing ropes and mooring cable at a high altitude, and then be winched down to the mooring mast. This type of landing maneuver would reduce the number of ground crewmen, but would require more time. Although the high landing was a common procedure for American airships, the \"Hindenburg\" had only performed this maneuver a few times in 1936 while landing in Lakehurst.\n\nAt 7:09, the airship made a sharp full-speed left turn to the west around the landing field because the ground crew was not ready. At 7:11, it turned back toward the landing field and valved gas. All engines idled ahead and the airship began to slow. Captain Pruss ordered aft engines full astern at 7:14 while at an altitude of , to try to brake the airship.\n\nAt 7:17, the wind shifted direction from east to southwest, and Captain Pruss ordered a second sharp turn starboard, making an s-shaped flightpath towards the mooring mast. At 7:18, as the final turn progressed, Pruss ordered 300, 300 and 500 kg of water ballast in successive drops because the airship was stern-heavy. The forward gas cells were also valved. As these measures failed to bring the ship in trim, six men (three of whom were killed in the accident) were then sent to the bow to trim the airship.\n\nAt 7:21, while the \"Hindenburg\" was at an altitude of , the mooring lines were dropped from the bow; the starboard line was dropped first, followed by the port line. The port line was overtightened as it was connected to the post of the ground winch. The starboard line had still not been connected. A light rain began to fall as the ground crew grabbed the mooring lines.\n\nAt 7:25 p.m., a few witnesses saw the fabric ahead of the upper fin flutter as if gas was leaking. Others reported seeing a dim blue flame – possibly static electricity, or St Elmo's Fire – moments before the fire on top and in the back of the ship near the point where the flames first appeared. Several other eyewitness testimonies suggest that the first flame appeared on the port side just ahead of the port fin, and was followed by flames which burned on top. Commander Rosendahl testified to the flames in front of the upper fin being \"mushroom-shaped\". One witness on the starboard side reported a fire beginning lower and behind the rudder on that side. On board, people heard a muffled detonation and those in the front of the ship felt a shock as the port trail rope overtightened; the officers in the control car initially thought the shock was caused by a broken rope.\n\nAt 7:25 p.m. local time, the \"Hindenburg\" caught fire and quickly became engulfed in flames. Eyewitness statements disagree as to where the fire initially broke out; several witnesses on the port side saw yellow-red flames first jump forward of the top fin near the ventilation shaft of cells 4 and 5. Other witnesses on the port side noted the fire actually began just ahead of the horizontal port fin, only then followed by flames in front of the upper fin. One, with views of the starboard side, saw flames beginning lower and farther aft, near cell 1 behind the rudders. Inside the airship, helmsman Helmut Lau, who was stationed in the lower fin, testified hearing a muffled detonation and looked up to see a bright reflection on the front bulkhead of gas cell 4, which \"suddenly disappeared by the heat\". As other gas cells started to catch fire, the fire spread more to the starboard side and the ship dropped rapidly. Although there were cameramen from four newsreel teams and at least one spectator known to be filming the landing, as well as numerous photographers at the scene, no known footage or photograph exists of the moment the fire started.\n\nWherever they started, the flames quickly spread forward first consuming cells 1 to 9, and the rear end of the structure imploded. Almost instantly, two tanks (it is disputed whether they contained water or fuel) burst out of the hull as a result of the shock of the blast. Buoyancy was lost on the stern of the ship, and the bow lurched upwards while the ship's back broke; the falling stern stayed in trim.\nAs the tail of the \"Hindenburg\" crashed into the ground, a burst of flame came out of the nose, killing nine of the 12 crew members in the bow. There was still gas in the bow section of the ship, so it continued to point upward as the stern collapsed down. The cell behind the passenger decks ignited as the side collapsed inward, and the scarlet lettering reading \"Hindenburg\" was erased by flames as the bow descended. The airship's gondola wheel touched the ground, causing the bow to bounce up slightly as one final gas cell burned away. At this point, most of the fabric on the hull had also burned away and the bow finally crashed to the ground. Although the hydrogen had finished burning, the \"Hindenburg\"'s diesel fuel burned for several more hours.\n\nThe time that it took from the first signs of disaster to the bow crashing to the ground is often reported as 32, 34 or 37 seconds. Since none of the newsreel cameras were filming the airship when the fire started, the time of the start can only be estimated from various eyewitness accounts and the duration of the longest footage of the crash. One careful analysis by NASA's Addison Bain gives the flame front spread rate across the fabric skin as about at some points during the crash, which would have resulted in a total destruction time of about 16 seconds (245m/15 m/s=16.3 s).\n\nSome of the duralumin framework of the airship was salvaged and shipped back to Germany, where it was recycled and used in the construction of military aircraft for the \"Luftwaffe\", as were the frames of the LZ 127 \"Graf Zeppelin\" and LZ 130 \"Graf Zeppelin II\" when both were scrapped in 1940.\n\nIn the days after the disaster, an official board of inquiry was set up at Lakehurst to investigate the cause of the fire. The investigation by the US Commerce was headed by Colonel South Trimble Jr, while Dr. Hugo Eckener led the German commission.\nThe disaster was well-documented because of the combination of many news crews having been on site at the time of the airship exploding and the significant extent of newsreel coverage and photographs, as well as Herbert Morrison's eyewitness radio report for station WLS in Chicago, which was broadcast the next day. Heavy publicity about the first transatlantic passenger flight of the year by Zeppelin to the United States attracted a large number of journalists to the landing. (The airship had already made one round trip from Germany to Brazil that year.)\n\nMorrison's broadcast remains one of the most famous in history. Parts of it were later dubbed onto newsreel footage, giving the impression that the words and film were recorded together. His plaintive, \"Oh, the humanity!\" has been widely used in popular culture.\n\nThe iconic newsreel footage was shot by four newsreel camera teams: Pathé News, Movietone News, Hearst News of the Day, and Paramount News. Al Gold of Fox Movietone News later received a Presidential Citation for his work. One of the most widely circulated photographs of the disaster (see photo at top of article), showing the airship crashing with the mooring mast in the foreground, was photographed by Sam Shere of International News Photos. When the fire started he did not have the time to put the camera to his eye and shot the photo \"from the hip\". Murray Becker of the Associated Press photographed the fire engulfing the airship while it was still on even keel using his 4 x 5 Speed Graphic camera. His next photograph (see right), shows flames bursting out of the nose as the bow telescoped upwards. In addition to professional photographers, spectators also photographed the crash. They were stationed in the spectators' area near Hangar No. 1, and had a side-rear view of the airship. Customs broker Arthur Cofod Jr. and 16 year-old Foo Chu both had Leica cameras with high speed film, allowing them to take a larger number of photographs than the press photographers. Nine of Cofod's photographs were printed in \"LIFE\" magazine while Chu's photographs were shown in the \"New York Daily News\".\nThe newsreels and photographs, along with Morrison's passionate reporting shattered public and industry faith in airships and marked the end of the giant passenger-carrying airships. Also contributing to the downfall of Zeppelins was the arrival of international passenger air travel and Pan American Airlines. Heavier-than-air aircraft regularly crossed the Atlantic and Pacific much faster than the 130 km/h (80 mph) speed of the \"Hindenburg\". The one advantage that the \"Hindenburg\" had over such aircraft was the comfort that she afforded her passengers, much like that of an ocean liner.\n\nIn contrast to the media coverage in the United States, media coverage of the disaster in Germany was more subdued. Although some photographs of the disaster were published in newspapers, the newsreel footage was not released until after World War II. Additionally, German victims were memorialized in a similar manner to fallen war heroes, and grassroots movements to fund zeppelin construction (as the case with the \"LZ4\" crash in 1908) was expressly forbidden by the Nazi government.\n\nThere had been a series of other airship accidents prior to the \"Hindenburg\" fire; many were caused by bad weather. The \"Graf Zeppelin\" had flown safely for more than 1.6 million kilometers (1.0 million miles), including the first circumnavigation of the globe by an airship. The Zeppelin company's promotions had prominently featured the fact that no passenger had been injured on any of its airships.\n\nDespite the sheer ferocity of the colossal fire, many of the crew members and passengers survived, but the majority of them were severely burned. Of the 36 passengers and 61 crewmen, 13 passengers and 22 aircrewmen died. Also killed was one ground crewman, the civilian linesman Allen Hagaman. Ten passengers and 16 crewmen died in the crash or in the fire. The majority of the victims were burnt to death, while others died jumping from the airship at an excessive height, or as a consequence of either smoke inhalation or falling debris. Six other crewmembers, three passengers and Allen Hagaman died in the following hours or days, mostly as a consequence of the burns.\n\nThe majority of the crewmen who died were up inside the ship's hull, where they either did not have a clear escape route or else were close to the bow of the ship, which hung burning in the air for too long for most of them to escape death. Most of the crew in the bow died in the fire, although at least one was filmed falling from the bow to his death. Most of the passengers who died were trapped in the starboard side of the passenger deck. Not only was the wind blowing the fire toward the starboard side, but the ship also rolled slightly to starboard as it settled to the ground, with much of the upper hull on that part of the ship collapsing outboard of the starboard observation windows, thus cutting off the escape of many of the passengers on that side. To make matters worse, the sliding door leading from the starboard passenger area to the central foyer and the gangway stairs (through which rescuers led a number of passengers to safety) jammed shut during the crash, further trapping those passengers on the starboard side. Nonetheless, some did manage to escape from the starboard passenger decks. By contrast, all but a few of the passengers on the port side of the ship survived the fire, with some of them escaping virtually unscathed. Although the most famous airship disaster, it was not the worst. Just over twice as many (73 of 76 on board) had perished when the helium-filled U.S. Navy scout airship crashed at sea off the New Jersey coast four years earlier on April 4, 1933.\n\nSome of the survivors were saved by luck. Werner Franz, the 14-year-old cabin boy, was initially dazed by the \nrealization that the ship was on fire. As he stood near the officer's mess where he had been putting away dishes moments before, a water tank holding ballast above him burst open, and he was suddenly soaked. This snapped him back to his senses, as he later told interviewers, and also put out the fire around him. He then made his way to a nearby hatch through which the kitchen had been loaded with provisions before the flight, and dropped through it just as the forward part of the ship was briefly rebounding into the air. He began to run toward the starboard side, but stopped and turned around and ran the other way, because the flames were being pushed by the wind in that direction. He made it clear of the wreck with no injuries, and was the last surviving crew member when he died at the age of 92 on August 13, 2014. The last surviving passenger is Werner G. Doehner (b. 1928), a retired electrical engineer who was an eight-year-old child traveling with his parents, brother, and sister at the time of the accident. His father and sister died in the disaster.\n\nWhen the control car crashed onto the ground, most of the officers leapt through the windows, but became separated. First Officer Captain Albert Sammt found Captain Max Pruss trying to re-enter the wreckage to look for survivors. Pruss's face was badly burned, and he required months of hospitalization and reconstructive surgery, but he survived.\n\nCaptain Ernst Lehmann escaped the crash with burns to his head and arms and severe burns across most of his back. He died at a nearby hospital the next day.\n\nWhen passenger Joseph Späh, a vaudeville comic acrobat, saw the first sign of trouble he smashed the window with his movie camera with which he had been filming the landing (the film survived the disaster). As the ship neared the ground he lowered himself out the window and hung onto the window ledge, letting go when the ship was perhaps 20 feet above the ground. His acrobat's instincts kicked in, and Späh kept his feet under him and attempted to do a safety roll when he landed. He injured his ankle nonetheless, and was dazedly crawling away when a member of the ground crew came up, slung the diminutive Späh under one arm, and ran him clear of the fire.\n\nOf the 12 crewmen in the bow of the airship, only three survived. Four of these 12 men were standing on the mooring shelf, a platform up at the very tip of the bow from which the forwardmost landing ropes and the steel mooring cable were released to the ground crew, and which was directly at the forward end of the axial walkway and just ahead of gas cell #16. The rest were standing either along the lower keel walkway ahead of the control car, or else on platforms beside the stairway leading up the curve of the bow to the mooring shelf. During the fire the bow hung in the air at roughly a 45-degree angle and flames shot forward through the axial walkway, bursting through the bow (and the bow gas cells) like a blowtorch. The three men from the forward section who survived (elevatorman Kurt Bauer, cook Alfred Grözinger, and electrician Josef Leibrecht) were those furthest aft of the bow, and two of them (Bauer and Grözinger) happened to be standing near two large triangular air vents, through which cool air was being drawn by the fire. Neither of these men sustained more than superficial burns. Most of the men standing along the bow stairway either fell aft into the fire, or tried to leap from the ship when it was still too high in the air. Three of the four men standing on the mooring shelf inside the very tip of the bow were actually taken from the wreck alive, though one (Erich Spehl, a rigger) died shortly afterwards in the Air Station's infirmary, and the other two (helmsman Alfred Bernhard and apprentice elevatorman Ludwig Felber) were reported by newspapers to have initially survived the fire, and then to subsequently have died at area hospitals during the night or early the following morning.\nHydrogen fires are notable for being less destructive to immediate surroundings than gasoline explosions because of the buoyancy of H, which causes heat of combustion to be released upwards more than circumferentially as the leaked mass ascends in the atmosphere; hydrogen fires are more survivable than fires of gasoline or wood. The hydrogen in the \"Hindenburg\" burned out within about 90 seconds.\n\nAt the time of the disaster, sabotage was commonly put forward as the cause of the fire, initially by Hugo Eckener, former head of the Zeppelin Company and the \"old man\" of German airships. In initial reports, before inspecting the accident, Eckener mentioned the possibility of a shot as the cause of the disaster, because of threatening letters that had been received, but did not rule out other causes. Eckener later publicly endorsed the static spark hypothesis. At the time on a lecture tour in Austria, he was awakened at about 2:30 in the morning (8:30 p.m. Lakehurst time, or approximately an hour after the crash) by the ringing of his bedside telephone. It was a Berlin representative of the \"New York Times\" with news that the \"Hindenburg\" \"exploded yesterday evening at 7 p.m. above the airfield at Lakehurst.\" By the time he left the hotel the next morning to travel to Berlin for a briefing on the disaster, the only answer that he had for the reporters waiting outside to question him was that based on what he knew, the \"Hindenburg\" had \"exploded over the airfield\"; sabotage might be a possibility. However, as he learned more about the disaster, particularly that the airship had burned rather than actually \"exploded\", he grew more and more convinced that static discharge, rather than sabotage, was the cause.\n\nCommander Charles Rosendahl, commander of the Naval Air Station at Lakehurst and the man in overall charge of the ground-based portion of the \"Hindenburg's\" landing maneuver, also came to believe that the \"Hindenburg\" had been sabotaged. He laid out a general case for sabotage in his 1938 book \"What About the Airship?\", which was as much an extended argument for the further development of the rigid airship as it was an historical overview of the airship concept.\n\nAnother proponent of the sabotage hypothesis was Max Pruss, commander of the \"Hindenburg\" throughout the airship's career. Pruss flew on nearly every flight of the \"Graf Zeppelin\" until the \"Hindenburg\" was ready. In a 1960 interview conducted by Kenneth Leish for Columbia University's Oral History Research Office, Pruss said early dirigible travel was safe, and therefore he strongly believed that sabotage was to blame. He stated that on trips to South America, which was a popular destination for German tourists, both airships passed through thunderstorms and were struck by lightning but remained unharmed.\n\nMost members of the crew refused to believe that one of them would commit an act of sabotage, insisting only a passenger could have destroyed the airship. A suspect favored by Commander Rosendahl, Captain Pruss, and others among the \"Hindenburg's\" crew, was passenger Joseph Späh, a German acrobat who survived the fire. He brought with him a dog, a German shepherd named Ulla, as a surprise for his children (Ulla did not survive the crash). He reportedly made a number of unaccompanied visits to feed his dog, who was being kept in a freight room near the stern of the ship. Those who suspected Späh based their suspicions primarily on those trips into the ship's interior to feed his dog, that according to some of the stewards Späh had told anti-Nazi jokes during the flight, recollections by stewards that Späh had seemed agitated by the repeated delays in landing, and that he was an acrobat who could conceivably climb into the airship's rigging to plant a bomb.\n\nIn 1962, A. A. Hoehling published \"Who Destroyed the Hindenburg?\", in which he rejected all theories but sabotage, and named a crew member as the suspect. Eric Spehl, a rigger on the Hindenburg who died in the fire, was named as the saboteur. Ten years later, Michael MacDonald Mooney's book \"The Hindenburg\", which was based heavily on Hoehling's sabotage hypothesis, also identified Spehl as the saboteur; Mooney's book was made into the movie \"The Hindenburg,\" the producers of which were sued by Hoehling for plagiarism; but Hoehling lost because he had presented his sabotage hypothesis as historical fact, and one cannot claim ownership of historical facts.\n\nHoehling claimed the following in naming Spehl as the culprit:\n\nHoehling's (and later Mooney's) hypothesis goes on to say that it is unlikely that Spehl wanted to kill people, and that he intended the airship to burn after the landing. However, with the ship already over 12 hours late, Spehl was unable to find an excuse to reset the timer on his bomb.\n\nIt has been suggested that Adolf Hitler himself ordered the \"Hindenburg\" to be destroyed in retaliation for Eckener's anti-Nazi opinions.\n\nSince the publication of Hoehling's book, most airship historians, including Dr. Douglas Robinson, have dismissed Hoehling's sabotage hypothesis because no solid evidence was ever presented to support it. No pieces of a bomb were ever discovered (and there is no evidence in existing documentation that the sample collected from the wreckage, and determined to be residue from a dry cell battery, was found anywhere near the stern of the airship), and on closer examination, the evidence against Spehl and his girlfriend turned out to be rather weak. Additionally, it is unlikely that Rigger Knorr would not remain at cell 4 to further assess the purported damage claimed by Kubis. In an interview with the TV show Secrets & Mysteries, Hoehling himself asserted it was only his theory and also suggested a short-circuit could be another potential cause of the fire. Additionally, Mooney's book has been criticized as having numerous fictional elements, and it has been suggested that the plot was created for the then-upcoming 1975 film. Although Mooney alleges that three \"Luftwaffe\" officers were aboard to investigate a potential bomb threat, there is no evidence they were on board to do so, and military observers were present on previous flights to study navigational techniques and weather forecasting practices of the airship crew.\n\nHowever, opponents of the sabotage hypothesis argued that only speculation supported sabotage as a cause of the fire, and no credible evidence of sabotage was produced at any of the formal hearings. Eric Spehl died in the fire and was therefore unable to refute the accusations that surfaced a quarter of a century later. The FBI investigated Joseph Späh and reported finding no evidence of Späh having any connection to a sabotage plot. According to his wife, Evelyn, Späh was quite upset over the accusations – she later recalled that her husband was outside their home cleaning windows when he first learned that he was suspected of sabotaging the \"Hindenburg,\" and was so shocked by the news that he almost fell off the ladder on which he was standing.\n\nNeither the German nor the American investigation endorsed any of the sabotage theories. Proponents of the sabotage hypothesis argue that any finding of sabotage would have been an embarrassment for the Nazi regime, and they speculate that such a finding by the German investigation was suppressed for political reasons. However, it has also been suggested that numerous crewmen subscribed to the sabotage hypothesis because they refused to accept any flaws with the airship or pilot error.\n\nSome more sensational newspapers claimed that a Luger pistol with one round fired was found among the wreckage and speculated that a person on board committed suicide or shot the airship. However, there is no evidence suggesting an attempted suicide or official report confirming the presence of a Luger pistol. Initially, before inspecting the scene himself, Eckener mentioned the possibility for a shot as the cause of the disaster, because of threatening letters they received. At the German enquiry Eckener discounted a shot – among many possibilities – as the cause as nearly impossible and highly improbable.\n\nHugo Eckener argued that the fire was started by an electric spark which was caused by a buildup of static electricity on the airship. The spark ignited hydrogen on the outer skin.\n\nProponents of the static spark hypothesis point out that the airship's skin was not constructed in a way that allowed its charge to be distributed evenly throughout the craft. The skin was separated from the duralumin frame by non-conductive ramie cords which had been lightly covered in metal to improve conductivity but not very effectively, allowing a large difference in potential to form between the skin and the frame.\n\nIn order to make up for the delay of more than 12 hours in its transatlantic flight, the \"Hindenburg\" passed through a weather front of high humidity and high electrical charge. Although the mooring lines were not wet when they first hit the ground and ignition took place four minutes after, Eckener theorised that they may have become wet in these four minutes. When the ropes, which were connected to the frame, became wet, they would have grounded the frame but not the skin. This would have caused a sudden potential difference between skin and frame (and the airship itself with the overlying air masses) and would have set off an electrical discharge – a spark. Seeking the quickest way to ground, the spark would have jumped from the skin onto the metal framework, igniting the leaking hydrogen.\n\nIn his 1964 book \"LZ-129 Hindenburg,\" Zeppelin historian Dr. Douglas Robinson points out that although ignition of free hydrogen by static discharge had become a favored hypothesis, no such discharge was seen by any of the witnesses who testified at the official investigation into the accident back in 1937. He goes on to write:\n\nUnlike other witnesses to the fire whose view of the port side of the ship had the light of the setting sun behind the ship, Professor Heald's view of the starboard side of the ship against a backdrop of the darkening eastern sky would have made the dim blue light of a static discharge on the top of the ship more easily visible.\n\nHarold G. Dick was Goodyear Zeppelin's representative with Luftschiffbau Zeppelin during the mid-1930s. He flew on test flights of the \"Hindenburg\" and its sister ship, the \"Graf Zeppelin II.\" He also flew on numerous flights in the original \"Graf Zeppelin\" and ten round-trip crossings of the north and south Atlantic in the \"Hindenburg.\" In his book \"The Golden Age of the Great Passenger Airships Graf Zeppelin & Hindenburg,\" he observes:\n\nIn addition to Dick's observations is the fact that during the \"Graf Zeppelin II's\" early test flights, measurements were taken of the airship's static charge. It is clear that Dr. Ludwig Durr and the other engineers at Luftschiffbau Zeppelin took the static discharge hypothesis seriously and considered the insulation of the fabric from the frame to be a design flaw in the \"Hindenburg.\" Thus, the German Inquiry concluded that the insulation of the outer covering caused a spark to jump onto a nearby piece of metal, thereby igniting the hydrogen. In lab experiments, using the \"Hindenburg's\" outer covering and a static ignition, hydrogen was able to be ignited but with the covering of the LZ 127 \"Graf Zeppelin,\" nothing happened. These findings were not well-publicized and covered up, perhaps to avoid embarrassment of such an engineering flaw in the face of the Third Reich.\n\nA variant of the static spark hypothesis, presented by Addison Bain, is that a spark between inadequately grounded fabric cover segments of the \"Hindenburg\" itself started the fire, and that the spark had ignited the \"highly flammable\" outer skin. The \"Hindenburg\" had a cotton skin covered with a finish known as \"dope\". It is a common term for a plasticised lacquer that provides stiffness, protection, and a lightweight, airtight seal to woven fabrics. In its liquid forms, dope is highly flammable, but the flammability of dry dope depends upon its base constituents, with, for example, butyrate dope being far less flammable than cellulose nitrate. Proponents of this hypothesis claim that when the mooring line touched the ground, a resulting spark could have ignited the dope in the skin.\n\nAn episode of the Discovery Channel series \"Curiosity\" entitled \"What Destroyed the \"Hindenburg\"?\", which first aired in December 2012, investigated both the static spark theory and St. Elmo's Fire, as well as sabotage by bomb. The team, led by British aeronautical engineer Jem Stansfield and American airship historian Dan Grossman, concluded that the ignition took place above the hydrogen vent just forward of where Mark Heald saw St. Elmo's Fire, and that the ignited hydrogen was channelled down the vent where it created a more explosive detonation described by crew member Helmut Lau. \"What Destroyed the \"Hindenburg\"?\" was aired as a standalone documentary on the UK's Channel 4 in March 2013.\n\nA. J. Dessler, former director of the Space Science Laboratory at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and a critic of the incendiary paint hypothesis (see below), favors a much simpler explanation for the conflagration: lightning. Like many other aircraft, the \"Hindenburg\" had been struck by lightning several times in its years of operation. This does not normally ignite a fire in hydrogen-filled airships due to the lack of oxygen. However, airship fires have been observed when lightning strikes the vehicle as it vents hydrogen as ballast in preparation for landing. The vented hydrogen mixes with the oxygen in the atmosphere, creating a combustible mixture. The \"Hindenburg\" was venting hydrogen at the time of the disaster.\n\nHowever, witnesses did not observe any lightning storms as the ship made its final approach.\n\nOn the 70th anniversary of the accident, \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" carried an article with yet another hypothesis, based on an interview of ground crew member Robert Buchanan. He had been a young man on the crew manning the mooring lines.\n\nAs the airship was approaching the mooring mast, he noted that one of the engines, thrown into reverse for a hard turn, backfired, and a shower of sparks was emitted. After being interviewed by Addison Bain, Buchanan believed that the airship's outer skin was ignited by engine sparks. Another ground crewman, Robert Shaw, saw a blue ring behind the tail fin and had also seen sparks coming out of the engine. Shaw believed that the blue ring he saw was leaking hydrogen which was ignited by the engine sparks.\n\nDr. Eckener rejected the idea that hydrogen could have been ignited by an engine backfire, postulating that the hydrogen could not have been ignited by any exhaust because the temperature is too low to ignite the hydrogen. The ignition temperature for hydrogen is , but the sparks from the exhaust only reach . The Zeppelin Company also carried out extensive tests and hydrogen had never ignited. Additionally, the fire was first seen at the top of the airship, not near the bottom of the hull.\n\nMost current analyses of the fire assume ignition due to some form of electricity as the cause. However, there is still much controversy over whether the fabric skin of the airship, or the hydrogen used for buoyancy, was the initial fuel for the resulting fire.\n\nThe incendiary paint theory (IPT) was proposed in 1996 by retired NASA scientist Addison Bain, stating that the doping compound of the airship was the cause of the fire, and that the \"Hindenburg\" would have burned even if it were filled with helium. The hypothesis is limited to the source of ignition and to the flame front propagation, not to the source of most of the burning material, as once the fire started and spread the hydrogen clearly must have burned (although some proponents of the incendiary paint theory claim that hydrogen burned much later in the fire or that it otherwise did not contribute to the rapid spread of the fire). The incendiary paint hypothesis asserts that the major component in starting the fire and feeding its spread was the canvas skin because of the compound used on it.\n\nProponents of this hypothesis argue that the coatings on the fabric contained both iron oxide and aluminum-impregnated cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) which remain potentially reactive even after fully setting. Iron oxide and aluminum can be used as components of solid rocket fuel or thermite. For example, the propellant for the Space Shuttle solid rocket booster includes both \"aluminum (fuel, 16%), (and) iron oxide (a catalyst, 0.4%)\". The coating applied to the Hindenburg's covering did not have a sufficient quantity of any material capable of acting as an oxidizer, which is a necessary component of rocket fuel, however, oxygen is also available from the air.\n\nBain received permission from the German government to search their archives and discovered evidence that, during the Nazi regime, German scientists concluded the dope on the \"Hindenburg's\" fabric skin was the cause of the conflagration. Bain interviewed the wife of the investigation's lead scientist Max Dieckmann, and she stated that her husband had told her about the conclusion and instructed her to tell no one, presumably because it would have embarrassed the Nazi government. Additionally, Dieckmann concluded that it was the poor conductivity, not the flammability of the doping compound, that led to the ignition of hydrogen. However, Otto Beyersdorff, an independent investigator hired by the Zeppelin Company, asserted that the outer skin itself was flammable. In several television shows, Bain attempted to prove the flammability of the fabric by igniting it with a Jacob's Ladder. Although Bain's fabric ignited, critics argue that Bain had to correctly position the fabric parallel to a machine with a continuous electric current inconsistent with atmospheric conditions. In response to this criticism, the IPT therefore postulates that a spark would need to be parallel to the surface, and that \"panel-to-panel arcing\" occurs, where the spark moves between panels of paint isolated from each other. A.J. Dessler, a critic of the IPT, points out a static spark does not have sufficient energy to ignite the doping compound, and that the insulating properties of the doping compound prevents a parallel spark path through it. Additionally, Dessler contends that the skin would also be electrically conductive in the wet and damp conditions before the fire.\n\nCritics also argue that port side witnesses on the field, as well as crew members stationed in the stern, saw a glow inside Cell 4 before any fire broke out of the skin, indicating that the fire began inside the airship or that after the hydrogen ignited, the invisible fire fed on the gas cell material. Newsreel footage clearly shows that the fire was burning inside the structure.\n\nProponents of the paint hypothesis claim that the glow is actually the fire igniting on the starboard side, as seen by some other witnesses. From two eyewitness statements, Bain asserts the fire began near cell 1 behind the tail fins and spread forward before it was seen by witnesses on the port side. However, photographs of the early stages of the fire show the gas cells of the \"Hindenburg's\" entire aft section fully aflame, and no glow is seen through the areas where the fabric is still intact. Burning gas spewing upward from the top of the airship was causing low pressure inside, allowing atmospheric pressure to press the skin inwards.\n\nOccasionally the \"Hindenburg\"'s varnish is incorrectly identified as, or stated being similar to, cellulose nitrate which, like most nitrates, burns very readily. Instead, the cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB) used to seal the zeppelin's skin is rated by the plastics industry as combustible but nonflammable. That is, it will burn if placed within a fire but is not readily ignited. It should also be noted that not all fabric on the Hindenburg burned. For example, the fabric on the port and starboard tail fins was not completely consumed. That the fabric not near the hydrogen fire did not burn is not consistent with the \"explosive\" dope hypothesis.\n\nThe TV show \"MythBusters\" explored the incendiary paint hypothesis. Their findings indicated that the aluminum and iron oxide ratios in the Hindenburg's skin, while certainly flammable, were not enough on their own to destroy the zeppelin. Had the skin contained enough metal to produce pure thermite, the \"Hindenburg\" would have been too heavy to fly. The MythBusters team also discovered that the \"Hindenburg\"'s coated skin had a higher ignition temperature than that of untreated material, and that it would initially burn slowly, but that after some time the fire would begin to accelerate considerably with some indication of a thermite reaction. From this, they concluded that those arguing against the incendiary paint theory may have been wrong about the airship's skin not forming thermite due to the compounds being separated in different layers. Despite this, the skin alone would burn too slowly to account for the rapid spread of the fire, as it would have taken four times the speed for the ship to burn. The MythBusters concluded that the paint may have contributed to the disaster, but that it was not the sole reason for such rapid combustion.\n\nThe theory that hydrogen was ignited by a static spark is the most widely accepted theory as determined by the official crash investigations. Offering support for the hypothesis that there was some sort of hydrogen leak prior to the fire is that the airship remained stern-heavy before landing, despite efforts to put the airship back in trim. This could have been caused by a leak of the gas, which started mixing with air, potentially creating a form of oxyhydrogen and filling up the space between the skin and the cells. A ground crew member, R.H. Ward, reported seeing the fabric cover of the upper port side of the airship fluttering, \"as if gas was rising and escaping\" from the cell. He said that the fire began there, but that no other disturbance occurred at the time when the fabric fluttered. Another man on the top of the mooring mast had also reported seeing a flutter in the fabric as well. Pictures that show the fire burning along straight lines that coincide with the boundaries of gas cells suggest that the fire was not burning along the skin, which was continuous. Crew members stationed in the stern reported actually seeing the cells burning.\n\nTwo main theories have been postulated as to how gas could have leaked. Dr. Eckener believed a snapped bracing wire had torn a gas cell open (see below), while others suggest that a maneuvering or automatic gas valve was stuck open and gas from cell 4 leaked through. During the airship's first flight to Rio, a gas cell was nearly emptied when an automatic valve was stuck open, and gas had to be transferred from other cells to maintain an even keel. However, no other valve failures were reported during the ship's flight history, and on the final approach there was no indication in instruments that a valve had stuck open.\n\nAlthough proponents of the IPT claim that the hydrogen was odorized with garlic, it would have been detectable only in the area of a leak. Once the fire was underway, more powerful smells would have masked any garlic odor. There were no reports of anyone smelling garlic during the flight, but no official documents have been found to prove that the hydrogen was even odorized.\n\nOpponents of this hypothesis note that the fire was reported as burning bright red, while pure hydrogen burns blue if it is visible at all, although there were many other materials that were consumed by the fire which could have changed its hue.\n\nSome of the airshipmen at the time, including Captain Pruss, asserted that the stern heaviness was normal, since aerodynamic pressure would push rainwater towards the stern of the airship. The stern heaviness was also noticed minutes before the airship made its sharp turns for its approach (ruling out the snapped wire theory as the cause of the stern heaviness), and some crew members stated that it was corrected as the ship stopped (after sending six men into the bow section of the ship). Additionally, the gas cells of the ship were not pressurized, and a leak would not cause the fluttering of the outer cover, which was not seen until seconds before the fire. However, reports of the amount of rain the ship had collected have been inconsistent. Several witnesses testified that there was no rain as the ship approached until a light rain fell minutes before the fire, while several crew members stated that before the approach the ship did encounter heavy rain. Albert Sammt, the ship's first officer who oversaw the measures to correct the stern-heaviness, initially attributed to fuel consumption and sending crewmen to their landing stations in the stern, though years later, he would assert that a leak of hydrogen had occurred. On its final approach the rainwater may have evaporated and may not completely account for the observed stern-heaviness, as the airship should have been in good trim ten minutes after passing through rain. Dr. Eckener noted that the stern heaviness was significant enough that 70,000 kilogram·meter (506,391 foot-pounds) of trimming was needed.\n\nAlthough Captain Pruss believed that the \"Hindenburg\" could withstand tight turns without significant damage, proponents of the puncture hypothesis, including Hugo Eckener, question the airship's structural integrity after being repeatedly stressed over its flight record.\n\nThe airship did not receive much in the way of routine inspections even though there was evidence of at least some damage on previous flights. It is not known whether that damage was properly repaired or even whether all the failures had been found. During the ship's first return flight from Rio, \"Hindenburg\" had once lost an engine and almost drifted over Africa, where it could have crashed. Afterwards, Dr. Eckener ordered section chiefs to inspect the airship during flight. However, the complexity of the airship's structure would make it virtually impossible to detect all weaknesses in the structure. In March 1936, the \"Hindenburg\" and the \"Graf Zeppelin\" made three-day flights to drop leaflets and broadcast speeches via loudspeaker. Before the airship's takeoff on March 26, 1936, Ernst Lehmann chose to launch the \"Hindenburg\" with the wind blowing from behind the airship, instead of into the wind as per standard procedure. During the takeoff, the airship's tail struck the ground, and part of the lower fin was broken. Although that damage was repaired, the force of the impact may have caused internal damage. Only six days before the disaster, it was planned to make the \"Hindenburg\" have a hook on her hull to carry aircraft in a similar way to what the US Navy did with the USS \"Akron\" and the USS \"Macon\". However, the trials were unsuccessful as the biplane hit the \"Hindenburg\"s trapeze several times. The structure of the airship may have been further affected by this incident.\n\nNewsreels, as well as the map of the landing approach, show the \"Hindenburg\" made several sharp turns, first towards port and then starboard, just before the accident. Proponents posit that either of these turns could have weakened the structure near the vertical fins, causing a bracing wire to snap and puncture at least one of the internal gas cells. Additionally, some of the bracing wires may have even been substandard. One bracing wire tested after the crash broke at a mere 70% of its rated load. A punctured cell would have freed hydrogen into the air and could have been ignited by a static discharge (see above), or it is also possible that the broken bracing wire struck a girder, causing sparks to ignite hydrogen. When the fire started, people on board the airship reported hearing a muffled detonation, but outside, a ground crew member on the starboard side reported hearing a crack. Some speculate the sound was from a bracing wire snapping.\n\nEckener concluded that the puncture hypothesis, due to pilot error, was the most likely explanation for the disaster. He held Captains Pruss and Lehmann, and Charles Rosendahl responsible for what he viewed as a rushed landing procedure with the airship badly out of trim under poor weather conditions. Pruss had made the sharp turn under Lehmann's pressure; while Rosendahl called the airship in for landing, believing the conditions were suitable. Eckener noted that a smaller storm front followed the thunderstorm front, creating conditions suitable for static sparks.\n\nDuring the US inquiry, Eckener testified that he believed that the fire was caused by the ignition of hydrogen by a static spark:\n\nHowever, the apparent stern heaviness during the landing approach was noticed thirty minutes before the landing approach, indicating that a gas leak resulting from a sharp turn did not cause the initial stern heaviness.\n\nThe 2001 documentary \"Hindenburg Disaster: Probable Cause\" suggested that 16-year-old Bobby Rutan, who claimed that he had smelled \"gasoline\" when he was standing below the \"Hindenburg\"'s aft port engine, had detected a diesel fuel leak. During the investigation, Commander Charles Rosendahl dismissed the boy's report. The day before the disaster, a fuel pump had broken during the flight, but the chief engineer testified that the pump had been replaced. The resulting vapor of a diesel leak, in addition to the engines being overheated, would have been highly flammable and could have self-combusted.\n\nHowever, the documentary makes numerous mistakes into assuming that the fire began in the keel. First, it implies that the crewmen in the lower fin had seen the fire start in the keel and that Hans Freund and Helmut Lau looked towards the front of the airship to see the fire, when Freund was actually looking rearward when the fire started. Most witnesses on the ground reported seeing flames at the top of the ship, but the only location where a fuel leak could have a potential ignition source is the engines. Additionally, while investigators in the documentary suggest it is possible for a fire in the keel to go unnoticed until it breaks the top section, other investigators such as Greg Feith consider it unlikely because the only point diesel comes into contact with a hot surface is the engines.\n\nRegardless of the source of ignition or the initial fuel for the fire, there remains the question of what caused the rapid spread of flames along the length of the airship. Here again the debate has centered on the fabric covering of the airship and the hydrogen used for buoyancy.\n\nProponents of both the incendiary paint hypothesis and the hydrogen hypothesis agree that the fabric coatings were probably responsible for the rapid spread of the fire. The combustion of hydrogen is not usually visible to the human eye in daylight, because most of its radiation is not in the visible portion of the spectrum but rather ultraviolet. Thus what can be seen burning in the photographs cannot be hydrogen. However, black-and-white photographic film of the era had a different light sensitivity spectrum than the human eye, and was sensitive farther out into the infrared and ultraviolet regions than the human eye. And while hydrogen tends to burn invisibly, the materials around it, if combustible, would change the color of the fire.\n\nThe motion picture films show the fire spreading downward along the skin of the airship. While fires generally tend to burn upward, especially including hydrogen fires, the enormous radiant heat from the blaze would have quickly spread fire over the entire surface of the airship, thus apparently explaining the downward propagation of the flames. Falling, burning debris would also appear as downward streaks of fire.\n\nThose skeptical of the incendiary paint hypothesis cite recent technical papers which claim that even if the airship had been coated with actual rocket fuel, it would have taken many hours to burn – not the 32 to 37 seconds that it actually took.\n\nModern experiments that recreated the fabric and coating materials of the \"Hindenburg\" seem to discredit the incendiary fabric hypothesis. They conclude that it would have taken about 40 hours for the \"Hindenburg\" to burn if the fire had been driven by combustible fabric. Two additional scientific papers also strongly reject the fabric hypothesis. However, these claims do not agree with the results the MythBusters achieved on the \"Hindenburg\" special of their TV show.\n\nThe most conclusive proof against the fabric hypothesis is in the photographs of the actual accident as well as the many airships which were not doped with aluminum powder and still exploded violently. When a single gas cell explodes, it creates a shock wave and heat. The shock wave tends to rip nearby bags which then explode themselves. In the case of the Ahlhorn disaster on January 5, 1918, explosions of airships in one hangar caused the explosions of others in three adjoining hangars, wiping out all five Zeppelins at the base.\n\nThe photos of the \"Hindenburg\" disaster clearly show that after the cells in the aft section of the airship exploded and the combustion products were vented out the top of the airship, the fabric on the rear section was still largely intact, and air pressure from the outside was acting upon it, caving the sides of the airship inward due to the reduction of pressure caused by the venting of combustion gases out the top.\n\nThe loss of lift at the rear caused the airship to nose up suddenly and the back to break in half (the airship was still in one piece), at that time the primary mode for the fire to spread was along the axial gangway which acted as a chimney, conducting fire which burst out the nose as the airship's tail touched the ground, and as seen in one of the most famous pictures of the disaster.\n\nThe actual site of the \"Hindenburg\" crash is at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, renamed by the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) as Naval Air Engineering Station (NAES) Lakehurst (or \"Navy Lakehurst\" for short), it is marked with a chain-outlined pad and bronze plaque where the airship's gondola landed. It was dedicated on May 6, 1987, the 50th anniversary of the disaster. Hangar No.1, which still stands, is where the airship was to be housed after landing. It was designated a Registered National Historic Landmark in 1968. Pre-registered tours are held through the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society.\n\n\nNotes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n\n\n\n"}

It specialises in lightweight content, traditional stories, and uncontroversial family content, including puzzles and recipes. It was launched on 26 November 1902 by John M. Walshe of People Newspapers, and originally cost just 1d.\n\nFor the first half of 2007, the magazine had an average circulation of 40,905, according to the Audited Bureau of Circulations. The People Newspaper Group (which also included the \"Wicklow People\", the \"Wexford People\" and the \"Waterford People\") is now owned by the Irish media giant Independent News and Media.\n\nThe magazine was designed to offer \"wholesome Irish Catholic fare\" to challenge the appearance of British newspapers in Ireland like the \"News of the World\" (which were denounced as \"scandal-sheets\" that lowered the moral tone of late 19th century/early 20th century Ireland). The magazine's appearance coincided with a broad stressing of Irish identity as a reaction to British imports. Among the other examples were the creation of the Gaelic Athletic Association to promote Gaelic games and to halt the growth of soccer and rugby (1880s), the appearance of the Gaelic League to promote the Irish language (1893), and the growth in the \"Irish-Ireland\" movement reflected in the creation of the Abbey Theatre to promote Irish arts (1904) and the creation by Arthur Griffith in 1904 of Cumann na nGaedheal to protest at the visit of King George V and his queen, Mary of Teck.\n\n\"Ireland's Own\" saw its role as projecting an image of Ireland free from \"alien\" influence, hence a content free from anything perceived as \"scandalous\" or \"anti-Catholic\". A critic described such magazines as offering \"a formula for 'healthy fireside reading' combining patriotism, pietism and national news with a minimum of foreign coverage or intellectual speculation.\" The concept of such a magazine is traced back to the series of pietistic family magazines launched by James Duffy in the mid-19th century.\n\nIts current editor, Phil Murphy, on the occasion of its centenary, described it with the words:\n\nIn terms of overall design and content, \"Ireland's Own\" is regularly described by critics as \"outdated\" and \"old-fashioned\", with its reliance on nostalgia that rarely reflects present realities. Its look and content has barely changed since the 1950s. Its demise has long been predicted, given its disproportionate appeal to the two segments presumed weakest to guarantee its future: elderly readers in rural Ireland, and those who have low disposable incomes. However, it remains a constant presence in the publishing market. One explanation for this is that the magazine taps into the younger nostalgia market who grew up with \"Ireland's Own\" and have a desire for familiarity and to rediscover a simpler Ireland in the face of monumental changes in Ireland. [citation needed]\n\nIts Christmas 2003 edition contained a series of articles, both fact and fiction, on such topics as \"Gathering the Holly\", \"Who is Father Christmas?\", \"The Christmas Fairy\" and \"Christmas Long Ago\".\n\nIn contrast to most Irish magazines, \"Ireland's Own\" is not Dublin-based but is edited in Wexford.\n\n\"Ireland's Own\" celebrated its centenary in 2002.\n\n"}

He also attended community college. In the late 1970s, he was a student at the University of Wyoming before dropping out when he didn't perform well on the cross country team.\n\nIn September 1985, Hogue, now 25 years old, stole the identity of a deceased infant and enrolled as a student at Palo Alto High School as Jay Mitchell Huntsman, a 16-year-old orphan from Nevada. On October 7, 1985, Hogue entered the Stanford Invitational Cross Country Meet. Hogue ran far ahead of the field and won the race, but did not report to the officials' table, arousing suspicion. Jason Cole, a reporter covering the event for the now-defunct \"Peninsula Times-Tribune,\" uncovered Hogue's identity theft, and Hogue left town.\n\nIn 1987, Hogue applied to Princeton University, using the alias Alexi Indris-Santana, a self-taught orphan from Utah, where he was then living. Hogue's application materials claimed that he had lived outdoors in the Grand Canyon, raising sheep and reading philosophers. Princeton invited Hogue to attend Princeton in the fall of 1988, but he deferred admission for one year, telling Princeton his mother was dying. In reality, Hogue had pled guilty to possessing stolen bicycle equipment, and had been sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nHogue served nine months before being paroled from Utah State Prison in March 1989. Having also received a financial aid award from Princeton, he immediately left for Princeton, in violation of the terms of his parole. For the next two years, he lived as Santana, was a member of the track team, and was admitted into the Ivy Club, one of Princeton's most exclusive eating clubs.\n\nHis real identity was exposed when Renee Pacheco, a former classmate from his days as \"Jay Huntsman\" at Palo Alto High School, recognized him. She contacted reporter Jason Cole, who exposed Hogue a second time. On February 26, 1991, Hogue was arrested in class and charged with forgery, theft, and falsifying records. In October 1992, Hogue pled guilty to third-degree theft for taking more than $22,000 in scholarship money and was sentenced to nine months in jail. Hogue served 134 days in jail.\n\nAt some point in 1992, Hogue was briefly employed by the Harvard Mineralogical Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a part-time cataloguer. At the time, Hogue was taking a course in mineralogy at the Harvard Extension School. In April 1993, the museum discovered that gems, mineral specimens, microscopes, and other items worth $50,000 had gone missing, and suspected Hogue as the result of a tip.\n\nOn May 10, 1993, police arrested Hogue in Somerville, Massachusetts and charged him with grand larceny. On May 26, 1993, Harvard police returned to Hogue's Somerville apartment and recovered $600 in electronic equipment reported stolen from a New Jersey electronics firm where Hogue worked in the summer of 1992. In June 1993, Hogue was charged with two counts of larceny and one count of receiving stolen property by the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office. Hogue's theft was one of the largest in the history of the Harvard University Police Department.\n\nHogue violated the conditions of his parole by returning to Princeton and hanging around the campus using the name Jim MacAuthor; he had not officially enrolled, but had attended social functions and eaten in the cafeteria. After a graduate student recognized him, he was arrested on February 19, 1996, and taken into custody by the Princeton Borough Police – who later released him on his own recognizance. He was later incarcerated in the Mercer County Correctional Center on a conviction for defiant trespass.\n\nHogue was released from prison in 1997 and vanished from the public eye. In 1999, Jesse Moss, a director making a documentary film about Hogue, tracked him down in Aspen, Colorado and secured his cooperation. The completed documentary, entitled \"Con Man\", was released in 2003. During this period, Hogue was arrested at least twice for theft.\n\nIn January, 2005, police with a warrant searched Hogue's home in San Miguel County, Colorado, finding 7,000 items, worth over $100,000, stolen from nearby homes where Hogue had worked as a remodeller and repairman. The stolen goods \"packed his house and a small secret compartment he'd built.\" He was apprehended in Tucson, Arizona on February 4, 2006 by Deputy United States Marshal Richard J. Tracy Jr. and deputies from the Pima County, Arizona Sheriff's department while Hogue was sitting in a Barnes & Noble cafe, surfing the internet.\n\nOn March 12, 2007, Hogue pleaded guilty to theft, in return for limiting his sentence and dropping additional charges. He was released on probation in 2012.\n\nOn November 3, 2016, Hogue was arrested in Aspen on a misdemeanor theft warrant from Boulder County, Colorado. Aspen police discovered Hogue living in an illegally constructed, camouflaged shack on Aspen Mountain, and possibly in the midst of building a second illegal structure on the mountain. Hogue gave a false name when apprehended and may be charged with criminal impersonation.\n\n\n"}

Some sources cite Kolbin's ethnicity as Russian, others as Chuvash.\n\nThe events lasted from 16 December until 19 December 1986. The protests began in the morning of 17 December, as a student demonstration attracted thousands of participants as they marched through Brezhnev Square (present-day Republic Square) across to the CPK Central Committee building. As the result, internal troops and OMON forces entered the city, violence erupted throughout the city. In the following days, protests spread to Shymkent, Taldykorgan, and Karaganda.\n\nThe primary reason for the peaceful student demonstrations that started in the early morning of 17 December was the dismissal of the long-serving First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, Dinmukhamed Kunaev (1964–1986) on 16 December and the appointment of Gennady Kolbin (1986–1989) as the First Secretary. Kolbin was unpopular as he had not previously lived or worked in Kazakhstan.\n\nAccording to Gorbachev's memoir, after the 27th Party Congress of December 1986, he met with Kunaev and discussed Kunaev's resignation. Kunaev expressed his desire to retire and proposed the appointment of someone without previous links to the Kazakh Communist Party in his place to stop advancement of Nursultan Nazarbayev (later and also the current President of Kazakhstan) in the party ranks. Kunaev, in his own book, said that Gorbachev never asked him about his replacement and only said \"a good comrade will be 'sent'\".\n\nDemonstrations started in the morning of 17 December 1986 as 200–300 students gathered in front of the Central Committee building on Brezhnev Square to protest the decision of the CPSU to appoint Kolbin rather than an ethnic Kazakh. The number of protesters increased to 1,000–5,000 as students from universities and institutes joined the crowd on Brezhnev Square.\n\nTASS reported, \n\nA group of students, incited by nationalistic elements, last evening and today took to the streets of Alma-Ata expressing disapproval of the decisions of the recent plenary meeting. Hooligans, parasites and other antisocial persons made use of this situation and resorted to unlawful actions against representatives of law and order. They set fire to a food store and to private cars and insulted townspeople.\n\nMeetings were held at factories, schools, and other institutions to condemn these actions.\n\nWitnesses reported that the rioters were given vodka, narcotics and leaflets, indicating that the riots were not spontaneous. They disagreed with the characterization of the riot as related to nationalism or independence; they said it was a protest over Gorbachev's appointing an outsider to head the state.\n\nAs a response, the CPK Central Committee ordered troops from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, \"druzhiniki\" (volunteers), cadets, policemen, and the KGB to cordon the square and videotape the participants. The situation escalated around 5 p.m., as troops were ordered to disperse the protesters. Clashes between the security forces and the demonstrators continued throughout the night in the square and in different parts of Almaty.\n\nThe second day, protests turned into civil unrest as clashes in the streets, universities and dormitories between troops, volunteers, and militia units, and Kazakh students turned into a wide-scale armed confrontation. The clashes were not controlled until the third day. The Almaty events were followed by smaller protests and demonstrations in Shymkent, Pavlodar, Karaganda and Taldykorgan.\n\nEstimates of the number of protesters vary.\n\nInitial reports from Moscow said that about 200 people were involved in the riots. Later reports from the Kazakh SSR authorities estimated that the riots drew 3,000 people.\n\nOther estimates are of at least 30,000 to 40,000 protesters, with 5,000 arrested and jailed, and an unknown number of casualties. Jeltoqsan leaders say over 60,000 Kazakhs participated in the protests nationwide.\n\nIn Karaganda, 54 students were excluded from the universities, and five students were prosecuted.\n\nAccording to the Kazakh SSR government, there were two deaths during the riots, including a volunteer police worker and a student. Both of them had died from blows to the head. About 100 others were detained and several others were sentenced to terms in labor camps.\n\nSources cited by the US Library of Congress claim that at least 200 people died or were summarily executed soon after. Some accounts estimate casualties at more than 1,000.\n\nThe writer Mukhtar Shakhanov claimed that a KGB officer testified that 168 protesters were killed. The Jeltoqsan events formed the basis of the main platforms of the Azat and Alash political parties and the Jeltoqsan movement that developed in independent Kazakhstan.\n\nKazakh students Kayrat Ryskulbekov and Lazat Asanova were among the victims.\n\nIn the March 1991 referendum, the population of Kazakhstan overwhelmingly voted to preserve the Soviet system. 89.2% of the population participated in the vote, of which 94.1% voted in favour.\nAfter the aborted coup d'état in August, the Soviet government in Kazakhstan declared independence on 16 December 1991 as the last republic to declare independence. The Soviet Union itself disintegrated ten days later.\n\nOn 18 September 2006, the Dawn of Liberty monument, dedicated to the 20th anniversary of Jeltoqsan, was opened with a solemn ceremony in Almaty. In the 21st century, Jeltoqsan has come to be regarded as the symbol of Kazakhstan's struggle for independence. The monument has three-parts: two pylons of intricate shapes symbolizing the breach and conflict of past and future, the explosion of the nation's consciousness and downfall of ideological canons, and the triumph of liberty and independence of the state.\n\nDinmukhamed Kunaev died in 1993 at the age of 82. An avenue and an institute in Almaty were named after him, as well as an avenue in the city centre of Astana, designated as the capital in 1997.\n\n\n"}

These organizations follow the teachings of Ramakrishna, the 19th century Indian mystic and figure in the Hindu Renaissance.\n\nThe event commemorates the day on January 1, 1886, when his followers believe that Ramakrishna revealed himself to be an Avatar, or God incarnate on earth. It is held each January 1. Although the observances are held in many locations, the most significant celebration takes place at Cossipore Garden House or Udyanbati near Kolkata (then called Calcutta), present Ramakrishna Math, a branch of Ramakrishna Order, the place where Ramakrishna spent last days of his life. It is classified as one of the \"Lord's special festivals\" by followers of Ramakrishna.\n\nIn India on January 1, 2010, as in other years, \"Devotees from all over the country thronged the famed Kali Temple at Dakshineshwar for Kalpataru Utsav, which is celebrated on this day every year.\" \nIndia's Eastern Railway scheduled two special trains on January 1, 2010, to carry the crowds to Kali Temple. The event includes providing medical care, blankets and clothing to the poor.\n\nThe first Kalpataru Day, January 1, 1886, was \"an event of unusual consequence and meaning\" in the life of Ramakrishna and his followers. Ramakrishna was suffering from throat cancer at that time, and his health was declining. He and his closest followers had moved to a garden house in the northern Calcutta neighbourhood of Cossipore. January 1 was a relatively good day for him, and he took a walk in the garden. There, he asked one of his followers, Girish, a question he had often asked before, \"Who do you say that I am?\" Girish responded that he believed that Ramakrishna was \"God incarnate, come to Earth out of mercy for humankind\". Ramakrishna replied, \"What more shall I say? May you be awakened.\" Ramakrishna then entered an \"ecstatic state\" and began touching all of his followers. Those he touched reported experiencing a variety of new states of consciousness, including vivid visions. For one, Vaikuntha, the visions persisted and interfered with daily life, so that he feared that he might be going insane.\n\nOne disciple, Ramachandra Dutta, explained that Ramakrishna had, in effect become Kalpataru (also called \"Kalpavriksha\"), the \"wish-fulfilling tree\" of Sanskrit literature and Hindu mythology. Dutta named the commemoration of this mystical event \"Kalpataru Day\" as a result. This event \"carried meanings and memories of cosmic import for the disciples\" and also prepared them for Ramakrishna's death\", which occurred only a few months later, on August 16, 1886.\n\nNone of Ramakrishna's monastic disciples were present during this event. Most having spent the night in meditation and keeping watch over the ailing Ramakrishna were taking rest, while others took the opportunity to clean Ramakrishna's room, bedding, etc. One of these disciples was Saratchandra Chakravarty, later known as Swami Saradananda. Having witnessed the day's event from the rooftop of Ramakrishna's residence, Saradananda later commented that \"Kalpataru Day\" is a misnomer, since the mythological wish-fulfilling tree (Kalpataru) grants anything, good or bad, and Ramakrishna gave only what was spiritually beneficial . Saradananda rather referred to the event as \"the bestowal of freedom from fear on all devotees by revealing himself\" \n\n"}

The conference was held in two sessions, the first from 23 February to 6 March, the second from 20 April to 2 June 1948.\n\nThe reason for summoning the conference was that the Foreign Secretary Conference 15 December 1947 between the four victorious nations United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union had ended without result in the German question. The recent Communist takeover in Czechoslovakia made it urgent for the western allies to help create a democratic (West) Germany.\nThe Soviet Union was not invited to the London Conference.\n\nThe conference conclusions were later called London recommendations.

These legends include claims about the food and allegations of discrimination by the company.\n\nIn the late 1980s, rumours persisted in the United Kingdom that McDonald's was covertly funding the Provisional IRA via NORAID. The source of these rumours was eventually traced to a CNN talkshow in which the company was praised for its generosity in providing funding for employees via Individual Retirement Accounts, or IRAs.\n\nLarge companies have been the subject of rumors that they substitute unusual or unethical substances in their products, usually to decrease costs. McDonald's is not immune to such claims.\n\nDating back to at least 1978, this rumor claims that McDonald's restaurants use earthworms in their hamburgers.\n\nOne belief is that McDonald's uses cow eyeballs in its products, permitting it to brand them as \"100% beef\". However, the USDA mandates that all beef by-products, including cow eyeballs, be appropriately labeled. McDonald's, has asserted that its products contain \"100% pure USDA inspected beef; no additives, no fillers, no extenders.\" In addition, cow eyeballs are actually more expensive than the more commonly eaten cow parts, due to demand from scientific institutions for experiments.\n\nA related claim is that McDonald's buys its meat from a company called \"100% beef\", making it possible for McDonald's to call beef by-products and soy products \"100% beef\".. During the McLibel case it was found that once imported beef was cleared by the authorities it lost its country of origin identity and gained the status of \"U.S. graded beef\", so this claim may have emerged from the lack of effective country of origin labelling in the U.S.\n\nAround March–April, 2000, an Internet rumor spread via e-mail in Brazil claimed that McDonald's meat was actually made from a genetically modified animal maintained in a laboratory. The e-mail stated that \"the few who saw it assure it is a very unpleasant sight: they have no limbs or horns, no bones (undeveloped cartilage instead), no eyes, no tail and no fur; its head is about the size of a Baseball; they are fed through tubes connected directly into their stomach\".\n\nThe e-mail carries on saying that \"some irreversible health damage can be done by eating this meat, resulting in diseases who manifest themselves in a way similar to AIDS, and have symptoms related to Alzheimer's Disease\" and ends encouraging the reader to boycott McDonald's until it sells actual beef. The urban legend has also been attributed to other fast-food chains and animal products, such as KFC and mutant chickens.\n\nThis rumor is a plot point of the science fiction novel \"The Space Merchants\", by Frederik Pohl (w/CM Kornbluth).\n\nThis rumor is that McDonald's uses pig fat in its milkshakes, ice cream, and fried potatoes. McDonald's provides complete ingredient lists for all of its products on each of its regional websites: this includes unidentified fats within the ice cream used to make soft serve cones and sundaes. McDonald's Australia, however, specifically mentions that \"there is definitely no lard or pig fat in the McDonald's Soft Serve.\" This rumor should not be confused with the fact that McDonald's has in the past used beef tallow as its frying oil.\n\nThere is a rumor in Australia that McDonald's Apple Pies were made of choko, not apples. This eventually led them to emphasize the fact that real Granny Smith apples are used in McDonald's pies.\n\nRumors in 2011 proclaimed an image shows a McDonald's sign announcing a $1.50 surcharge for African-American customers. This was proven to be a hoax.\n\nFake news websites since 2015 have purported that McDonald's restaurants in Colorado are converting children's playgrounds to lounges for on-premises cannabis consumption. The story has been disavowed by a McDonald's spokesperson.\n\n"}

{"id": "33154381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33154381", "title": "New Theatre Royal", "text": "New Theatre Royal\n\nThe New Theatre Royal is a Victorian Grade II* listed theatre in the heart of Portsmouth, England, with a capacity of 667. The theatre building was constructed in 1854 as Landport Hall. It was converted to a theatre two years later. It was rebuilt in 1884 by Charles J. Phipps and again in 1900 by Frank Matcham.\n\nThe Theatre reopened in October 2015 after a £4.7M refurbishment project.\n\nThe present site was built to replace a theatre located in the High Street (now designated \"old Portsmouth\". The theatre features in Charles Dickens' novel \"Nicholas Nickleby\". A popular music hall, it hosted performances by Niccolò Paganini and Franz Liszt and Mr Keane the leading actor manager of the early nineteenth century. It closed in 1854 and was demolished in 1856 with a number of other buildings to allow for the construction of a military establishment, the Cambridge Barracks. This building now houses Portsmouth Grammar School, a fee paying independent school. The three-arch entrance to the school occupies the location of the theatre. The city archives contain an 1824 poster/playbill of a performance of The Merchant of Venice starring Mr Keane and paintings of the exterior and interior of the theatre. These show the theatre to have been a low building with no windows and a door with a Grecian portico typical of larger houses of the era.The interior was rectangular with two tiers of boxes along each wall and standing in the pit. It would have had a smaller audience capacity than the theatre which replaced it. The illustration of the Portsmouth Theatre by Phiz in Nicholas Nickleby is true to reality though not to scale.\n\nExtract from 'Nicholas Nickleby'\n\n\"They groped their way through a dark passage, and, descending a step or two, threaded a little maze of canvas screens and paintpots, and emerged upon the stage of the Portsmouth Theatre.\n'Here we are,' said Mr Crummles.\nIt was not very light, but Nicholas found himself close to the first entrance on the prompt side, among bare walls, dusty scenes, mildewed clouds, heavily daubed draperies, and dirty floors. He looked about him; ceiling, pit, boxes, gallery, orchestra, fittings, and decorations of every kind,--all looked coarse, cold, gloomy, and wretched.\n'Is this a theatre?' whispered Smike, in amazement; 'I thought it was a blaze of light and finery.'\n'Why, so it is,' replied Nicholas, hardly less surprised; 'but not by day, Smike—not by day.' \"\n\nNicholas Nickleby Charles Dickens 1838–39\n\nDickens was born in Portsmouth and visited the theatre in 1838 to research Nicholas Nickleby. He was not only a brilliant writer but a consummate performer and would-be actor. His readings were legendary and made him a 19th-century celebrity. There is a belief that he may have performed at the Portsmouth Theatre but this is unlikely. His descriptions in Nicholas Nickleby show that in addition to the auditorium he visited the stage and back stage but his career as a public performer began some ten years into his literary success and long after its publication. He is known to have performed in Portsmouth later but at St Peter's Hall. Sadly, he did not perform at the current theatre and there is no evidence of his visiting it though it is possible.\n\nIn the same year the old theatre was demolished, Mr Henry Rutley opened a new venue on the present site. Rutley (born Newcastle 1816) was an impresario and circus proprietor who had arrived in Portsmouth in 1854 and purchased the Swan Tavern in Commercial Road and the adjoining Landport Hall, a raquet court. He converted the hall to accommodate equestrian displays and applied to the magistrates for permission to construct a new theatre on the site. The magistrates, believing theatres places of ill-repute, granted a licence for a limited period with the condition that there was no direct access from the tavern. A door to the hall, bricked in during building, was temporarily uncovered during renovation work in 2004. The Theatre Royal opened on 29 September 1856 with a production entitled 'A New Way to Pay Old Debts'. Rutley managed the venue with J W Boughton as his assistant and was highly successful. In a typical week the theatre would host two plays a night with matinees at the weekend. Rutley died of 'dropsy'in 1874. His grave can be seen in Highland Road Cemetery in Southsea. Boughton became manager of the theatre in 1876 and, after the death of Rutley's successor J C Hughes, took over control of the Portsmouth Theatres Company in 1882. Rutley's widow eventually sold the theatre to him.\n\nBoughton decided on a major rebuild demolishing and replacing the theatre with the present building which re-opened on 4 August 1884 with Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Princess Ida\". He engaged the most famous theatre architect of the day, C J Phipps, who had earlier built London’s Gaiety, Theatre Royal and Haymarket theatres among others. The new building had a four tier auditorium (stalls or pit, dress circle, upper circle and gods). The theatre reflected the rigid social distinctions of the day. The 6-door frontage led to the dress circle to accommodate the wealthy. Patrons in the other floors entered by single doors to the side of the main foyer. Seating capacity was under 1000 but there was space for standing patrons with refreshment bars on each level. The stage was 40 ft deep with a 30 ft proscenium, fly tower and traps.\n\nPhipps also designed the Empire Theatre (aka Empire Palace Theatre) in Edinburgh Road, built by Corke of Fratton, which opened in 1891. A two-tiered music hall with a small stage, it was a milestone in design for public safety. Phipps' Exeter Theatre Royal had been destroyed in a fire shortly after opening in 1886. The Empire was a radical improvement in build quality and design. The Empire struggled to compete with the Royal, Princes and Kings. A plan in the early 1900s to build a 'super theatre' on the site today occupied by the \"Zurich\" offices was rejected by magistrates and the Empire was extensively redecorated and reopened with Marie Lloyd in 1913. It continued to stage variety shows, even when the other venues converted to screening films, but the quality of these declined to the extent that it ended staging \"We never clothe 'em\" shows, soft core striptease. The Empire was demolished to make way for a supermarket in 1958. It is said that the Empire Company applied unsuccessfully to lease the Theatre Royal.\n\nThe continued success of the theatre led Boughton to decide to enlarge the stage and he engaged Frank Matcham to renovate the building and build a 65 ft stage in 1900.\n\nMatcham was arguably the greatest theatre architect in UK history. His buildings are loved by a variety of artistes as the ideal place to perform. He built over a hundred and fifty theatres across the country including the Tower Ballroom Blackpool, Sadlers Wells and the London Palladium, his greatest success. (The exact number is not known as much of the Matcham archive was destroyed in the WW2 bombing of London.) A brilliant and innovative architect, Matcham perfected increasingly larger floors of seating without supporting pillars, shaped to allow full view of the stage from all seats. He developed 'raked' stages (built at an incline toward the audience) to improve vision from the upper circle and gods, and decorative mouldings and shaped frontage to the balcony fronts that encouraged better acoustics. Matcham constructed the stage and auditorium area to form a natural bell chamber to project and amplify. Comedian Jimmy Tarbuck has said of the Palladium that you can \"feel the sound roll around the theatre\". Matcham's genius was to create palaces of entertainment which were not only opulent and beautiful but efficient and intimate both for audience and performer.\n\nMatcham enlarged the Theatre Royal stage, rebuilt the dress circle and modified the upper circle and added a cast iron conservatory to the front of the building to allow more patrons into the dress and upper circle bars. The Theatre Royal stage featured a \"run-on\" or \"stage-roller\", a large treadmill that allowed horses and vehicles to appear to move on stage. It was a feature of the annual pantomime and it is believed that two racing chariots appeared in a production of Ben Hur shortly after the renovation.\n\nBoughton's success led him to engage Matcham to build two more theatres in Portsmouth, the Prince's Theatre in Lake Road and Kings Theatre in Southsea. The Kings opened in 1907 and is still operating. The Princes Theatre was of a similar structure to the Theatre Royal with a similar cast iron conservatory. It was destroyed in a daylight bombing raid on the city in 1942 during a children's cinema matinee. The three theatres constituted the Portsmouth Theatres Company with a common repertory troupe.\n\nOther surviving Phipps-Matcham theatres include the Tivoli Aberdeen,\n\nMost of the famous performers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries appeared at the Theatre Royal. Sir Henry Irving and his leading lady and mistress, Ellen Terry, appeared many times both individually and together. Sarah Bernhardt performed there on several occasions, including her legendary appearances in later life when in a wheelchair. She left her signature on the wall of the dressing rooms (it was retrieved after the fire in 1972). Marie Lloyd was also a regular. Laurel and Hardy appeared before fame in Hollywood and Oliver Hardy chose the theatre as the venue for his birthday party in 1954. Similarly Morecombe and Wise were among many twentieth-century variety stars who appeared early in their career. Irving died on tour in a Bradford hotel in 1905 but his last complete set of performances was completed two weeks earlier at the Theatre Royal Portsmouth. Ellen Terry was appearing there the week he died. During some of performances his private secretary and theatre manager, Abraham ('Bram') Stoker - author of his biography and of the classic Gothic novel \"Dracula\" - worked in the offices backstage.\n\nAt its height from the Victorian to pre-WW2 eras, theatres provided a dynamic programme of entertainment to the communities they served typically, boasting \"two shows nightly\" with weekend matinees. Like cinemas, the evening programme ran a major and supporting show. As the Victorian wealthy liked to dine late after a trip to the theatre, the main performance started at 7.30 and the support (shorter and usually less demanding such as a light drama or farce) opened afterwards. Audiences could pay to attend either or both performances. With three venues in Portsmouth from the 1900s to the second world war, the city had a stunning level of entertainment choice and provision.\n\nProgramming also provides an insight into the talent and workload of the acting profession. In most weeks, the performances would change with as many as three distinct programmes of shows. Posters from the 1860s show an actor taking the lead in Hamlet followed by the lead in a farce at the start of the week, and the lead role in different plays at the weekend, a formidable memory load.\n\nFrom Shakespeare's time onward, theatre was subject to control and censorship partially out of its moral reputation and partially through recognition of its influence as the world's first form of mass communication. In the eighteenth century legislation insisted that drama could only be performed by theatres that had been granted a royal charter or licence (1737) making them 'patent' theatres. This dispensation entitled them to be known as \"Theatre Royal\" and display a royal insignia. This accounts for the fact that this is the most common name for 19th-century theatres across the UK. The original 'Portsmouth Theatre was not patented when Dickens wrote Nicholas Nickleby but gained authorisation at some point thereafter. The patent and title passed to Rutley's theatre in 1856 probably because he reassured the local magistrates that his theatre would be unlike the several 'dubious' places of entertainment then in the city and designed for \"middle class families\".\n\nThere is no clear evidence of when or why people began to refer to the theatre as 'New'. From 1856 to 1976 the theatre was official the Theatre Royal. At some point the 'New' was informally added. Evidence from local newspapers held in the theatres archive at the Victoria and Albert Museum confirm that this was in use by the middle of the century and either began when Rutley's building replaced the one in the High Street or when the CJ Phipps building replaced Rutley's. The frontage of the theatre says both \"Theatre Royal\" and \"New Theatre Royal\" indicating that the name was in use by the time CJ Phipps was contracted to design the present building. Archived material indicates that each name was used on material such as programmes.\n\nThe Theatre Royal officially became New Theatre Royal when the present trust was incorporated in 1976.\n\nBy the 1920s, radio and cinema led to the decline in attendances and, coupled with economic depression and war costs, theatres began to close or convert to film screening. These including the Prince's and Kings. The Theatre Royal was home to a repertory company, The Denville Players, until 1932 when it too had a projection room installed and became a cinema. Portsmouth was subject to extensive damage during the WW2 blitz. The neighbouring Guildhall was gutted by fire and the Prince's destroyed by a direct hit during an afternoon matinee for children but the Royal escaped unharmed. It continued as a cinema until 1948 when it reverted to a variety theatre. According to local academic and musician David Allen, the theatre was the venue for the first live rock 'n' roll performance in the UK in 1954.\n\nAdditional competition from television continued to force closures across the country and the Theatre Royal was eventually forced to shut in 1955. In 1956 Bernard Delfont's 'Brilliant Summer Revue' starring David Nixon was in the Theatre Royal for a Summer Season. In 1957 it opened as a repertory theatre under local impresario Hector Ross but this was short lived and from 1960 it operated only as a bingo hall and a venue for wrestling. For a brief period a young Australian, Robert Stigwood, was Ross's assistant. In the 1960s Stigwood would become one of the leading impresarios in popular music.\n\nIn 1966 the owners of the theatre, Portsmouth Theatres Company, sought permission from the council to over-ride its 'listed' status and demolish it. The council agreed, describing the theatre as \"an eyesore in the centre of our fine city.\" A pressure group was formed to oppose this, leading to a council decision in which the proposal was beaten by only one vote!\n\nThe empty building began to attract vandals. In 1968 squatters occupied it and valuable brass fittings and roof lead were stolen. The continuing decay and damage led to the formation of the Theatre Royal Society which pressured to defend and preserve the building. This campaign included the locally born actor Brian Murphy who had starred in 'The Boyfriend' and is now a patron of the theatre. The society became the New Theatre Royal trust in 1976.\n\nIn 1971 the controversial director, Ken Russell chose the theatre as the location for a film version of the hit musical \"The Boyfriend\". The play written by Sandy Wilson had been a stage hit in the UK and USA. A love story set on the Riviera in the 1920s, it uses Shakespearean techniques of false identity and final revelation. Russell, who wanted to make a parody of the work of Busby Berkley, added a story twist by setting it amongst a run-down repertory company with the love story on stage mirrored in one off. He chose the ballet dancer Christopher Gable and the model Twiggy for the lead roles backed by an ensemble cast of experienced stage actors including Barbara Windsor, Brian Murphy, Murray Melvin, Georgina Hale and dancer Tommy Tune. Vladek Sheybal played a visiting impresario and there was a cameo role for Glenda Jackson (not listed in the credits). A young composer, Peter Maxwell Davies, adapted the score.\n\nRussell (who would go on to produce a film version of The Who album \"Tommy\" in Portsmouth) shot most of the film on location in the empty theatre and adjoining streets giving it an eerie sense of period and reality. It was to be the Victorian theatre's last performance.\n\nThe following year, 1972, children entered the theatre and lit fireworks setting the stage on fire. A member of the public alerted a patrolling policeman to the smoke but by the time the fire brigade arrived the rear of the theatre was ablaze. Early in the fire the ropes of the safety curtain burned through causing it to fall into place saving the auditorium. (Ironically, the curtain had been faulty and temperamental for many years and regularly refused to operate.) The stage, fly tower and the entire building behind the proscenium arch was destroyed.\n\nOnce again, demolition was proposed but the Theatre Royal Society was there to oppose the plan. Amongst those who campaigned to save the theatre was the actor Brian Murphy who had appeared in \"The Boyfriend\". Murphy was born on the Isle of Wight and spent his childhood in Portsmouth.\n\nIn 1975, volunteers were allowed back into the building to start the long process of repair and renovation and a trust was formally established to care for the theatre. The New Theatre Royal (Portsmouth) Limited was registered in 1976 with a subsidiary trading company, NTR Trading Limited, as regulations did not allow charities to retail. The Theatre Royal was finally officially the New Theatre Royal. Leading figures in the restoration and rebirth included local teacher John Offord and Jean Salisbury who was made a \"Cultural Champion\" by the Minister for Sport and Culture in 2010.\n\nThe theatre was gradually repaired, largely by volunteers, and slowly came back into operation. In 1984 a small temporary stage was built over the orchestra pit in front of the proscenium arch. Productions were largely restricted to amateur performances.\n\nDamage to the theatre extended beyond the fire in 1972. Thieves stole valuable brass fittings and other artefacts in the 60's. In the 70's thieves with a van stole auditorium doors which had been removed for renovation whilst volunteers worked in the theatre. In the early 70's artefacts, papers and records including a large collection of posters were moved from the managers office for safekeeping. (The offices and dressing rooms along with the Strand lighting unit were situated to the 'audience' left of the stage behind the White Swan and survived the fire. They were demolished in 1980.) These records were transferred too an empty shop nearby in Guildhall Walk. Two years later, the entire content of the shop were found to have disappeared. Neither the volunteers or the owner of the shop had authorised or knew of their removal. These items were never retrieved.\n\nSarah Bernhardt left her signature on the wall of the dressing room. This was retrieved after the fire and is now in the possession of the trust.\n\nIn the early 'noughties', builders renovating a house in Southsea found a number of posters from the Rutley theatre under floorboards. Most dated from the 1860s. They were sold to Langford Antiques in Albert Road Southsea where they were framed and sold. Several were purchased for the theatre trust.\n\nIn 2003, faced with on-going financial stringency, the Board of Trustees commissioned the Boyden Report which advised a short closure and re-launch and the appointment of an experienced professional director. Shortly after this appointment, the Project Director of a local social enterprise (The Portsmouth and SE Hampshire Partnership) which had been entrusted with finding suitable projects for £1m from the Onyx environmental trust, added the NTR as a last minute addition to the shortlist. The theatre was awarded £440,000, the largest single grant given by the Onyx Trust. With additional funding, the Matcham cast iron portico was renovated, central heating and a new pit bar installed, and original vintage seating in the stalls which had previously been used on the set of Baz Luhrmann's \"Moulin Rouge\". A larger stage was built in front of the proscenium. To accommodate this, the frontage of the lower boxes had to be removed. Investigation revealed that these were prefabricated and fitted using large bolts. They were stored beneath the stage until eventually reinstatement when the new stage house was built. An external lighting rig was erected over the open stage.\n\nThe renovation led to a dynamic programme development endorsed by the trust board. Drama, stand up comedy, music and dance became features of each season whilst work with local schools and community groups was expanded. The trust developed links with the university of Portsmouth, a funder with the city council. The New Theatre Royal gained prominence on the cultural scene of the city. However, performances were still restricted by the lack of a proper stage and get-in and limited seating capacity. Inevitably, lack of operating finance became problematic again necessitating a period known as \"NTR Lite\" with less risky but less exciting programing.\n\nShortly after the recruitment of a new executive (artistic) director, the trust embarked upon the most challenging an exciting period since the remodelling by Matcham.\n\nThe board of trustees appointed a sub-committee to investigate and advise on the options for capitalising on its vacant \"back lot\". The outcome was a plan to rebuild the stage and back stage accommodation in addition to teaching facilities for the university. In 2009, London-based architects Peynore and Prasad were contracted to design the building and a professional fundraiser was appointed to raise the estimated £4m cost to the trust. A fund raising programme \"Let's Make It Great\" began at the opening of 2010 with a weekend finishing with a gala performance MC'd by comedian and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig and headlined by the actor Sheila Hancock, chancellor of the university. Broadcaster and musician Paul Jones and actor Christopher Timothy were among the cast list which included popular and classical music, comedy, opera and dance. At the end of the evening, Sheila Hancock accepted the invitation to become the patron of the theatre.\n\nIn May 2010, the theatre hosted the first screening in nearly three decades of \"The Boyfriend\", an honour it shared in the same week with the Verona Film Festival. The screening was preceded by an interview with the director Ken Russell and cast members Twiggy, Brian Murphy, Georgina Hale and Murray Melvin and the score composer Sir Peter Maxwell Davis, former Master of the Queens Music. The interview was hosted by local television personality Sally Taylor. Following this event, Twiggy, Sir Peter and Brian Murphy agreed to join Sheila Hancock as patrons.\n\n"}

It was described in full in December 2003 by the Israeli newspaper \"Yedioth Ahronoth\", though news reports had circulated about the plot since January 1999. The plan was conceived as retaliation for Iraqi Scud missile attacks during the Gulf War.\n\nWhen Saddam's uncle, Khairallah Talfah, was discovered to be terminally ill, the Israelis investigated the possibility of using a commando team to ambush the funeral party. A commando team from the Israeli Army's elite Sayeret Matkal special forces unit was to be inserted into Iraq from Jordan, where they would travel to the funeral near Tikrit and kill Saddam with TV-guided \"Midras\" missiles.\n\nA rehearsal for the operation took place on November 5, 1992 in the Negev desert. The operation's execution was just two days away. However, in the rehearsal, Israeli commandos accidentally fired live rounds into a convoy simulating the target, killing five of their fellow Sayeret Matkal commandos and wounding six more. The head of the IDF, Ehud Barak, had been watching the rehearsal at the time.\n\nThe plan was cancelled. Israeli press reports described the incident as a \"training accident.\" Israeli censors tried to prevent Israeli newspapers from publishing the fact that the head of military intelligence, Uri Sagi, had witnessed the accident, but the censors relented a few weeks later. On November 24, the American newspaper \"The Miami Herald\" reported that the soldiers involved in the accident had been rehearsing a plan to kill Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. The \"New York Times\", \"The Times\", and the \"Independent\" also reported on the apparent attempt against Nasrallah, and the Israeli military censor complained the reporters from all newspapers involved had violated censorship laws.\n\nSeven years later, Operation Bramble Bush II once again targeted Saddam. Mossad agents had scouted locations in Iraq for the ambush of the Iraqi leader. However, as before, the plan was scrapped, this time due to both the U.S. and Britain's Operation Desert Fox and concerns that the assassination could harm the Israeli-Arab peace process.\n"}

Founded in 2005, the festival often takes place the weekend after Labor Day and features food vendors, live music, and information booths. The event has always been free to attend.\n\nAccording to Paul Stanford, founder and director of the event:\n\nThe Portland Hempstalk Festival is an annual, two-day event. Hempstalk was first held in Portland, Oregon's Tom McCall Waterfront Park in downtown Portland in 2005 and 2006, with about 10,000 visitors each of the first two years.\n\nIn 2007, nearly 20,000 people attended the third annual Hempstalk festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park. While organizers insisted smoking would not be tolerated, the smell of marijuana lingered in the air and some festival goers chose to consume various forms of cannabis foods. No festival attendees were arrested. Originally slated for Tom McCall Waterfront Park, the event was temporarily canceled by Portland Parks & Recreation due to \"unspecified 'problems' the city encountered with the event in the past two years there.\" According to the Hempstalk official site, after being denied a permit at Waterfront Park based upon the city's ruling, the previous location was already booked and the City Parks & Recreation Department \"refused to issue a permit to use a different park, citing unsubstantiated claims that minors were drinking beer in the park... and widespread marijuana smoking was taking place (not in public view and only by medical marijuana patients).\" Hempstalk officials deny these claims. Due to limited space, officials had doubts about hosting the event at Sellwood Riverfront Park in the future.\n\nIn 2008, the festival was held in Eastbank Festival Plaza, organized by Paul Stanford of The Hemp and Cannabis Foundation (THCF). In addition to the usual events and activities featured, the two-day event offered educational panels to inform attendants about industrial hemp, the legal use of marijuana, and answer any other questions they may have.\n\nOn September 12–13, 2009, the Portland Hempstalk Festival moved to Kelley Point Park, in the far Northwest corner of Portland, Oregon, at the confluence of the Columbia River and the Willamette River. 40,000 people attended over two days. Music was performed by Native American political activist, poet and songwriter John Trudell and his band, Bad Dog, Folk Uke (Amy Nelson and Cathy Guthrie, daughters of Willie Nelson and Arlo Guthrie), the Herbivores, Rocker T, the Human Revolution, Binghi & the Seventh Seal, State of Jefferson, Marquee, Pass Margo and Tim Pate. Speakers included famed author and activist, Jack Herer, making his fifth Hempstalk appearance. Herer had a heart attack and collapsed moments after giving a speech on Saturday, September 12. He was in critical condition in a Portland area hospital for a month and moved to a Eugene, Oregon nursing home in early October 2009 for further recovery.\n\nOther Hempstalk speakers have included National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) founder Keith Stroup, NORML director Allen St. Pierre, THCF and CRRH director and author of the Oregon Cannabis Tax Act Paul Stanford, Oregon NORML director Madeline Martinez, Chris Conrad, Mikki Norris, comedian and writer Ngaio Bealum, Green Party 2012 presidential candidate, Jill Stein, author Bill Drake, Dr. Tod Mikuriya, Dr. Phillip Leveque, Seattle Hempfest director Vivian McPeak, and medical marijuana pioneer, Dennis Peron.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1791642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1791642", "title": "Railway spine", "text": "Railway spine\n\nRailway spine was a nineteenth-century diagnosis for the post-traumatic symptoms of passengers involved in railroad accidents.\n\nThe first full length medical study of the condition was John Eric Erichsen's classic book, \"On Railway and Other Injuries of the Nervous System\". For this reason, railway spine is often known as Erichsen's disease.\n\nRailway collisions were a frequent occurrence in the early 19th century. Exacerbating the problem was the fact that railway cars were flimsy, wooden structures with no protection for the occupants.\n\nSoon a group of people started coming forward who claimed that they had been injured in train crashes, but had no obvious evidence of injury. The railroads rejected these claims as fake.\n\nThe nature of symptoms caused by \"railway spine\" was hotly debated in the late 19th century, notably at the meetings of the (Austrian) Imperial Society of Physicians in Vienna, 1886. Germany's leading neurologist, Hermann Oppenheim, claimed that all railway spine symptoms were due to physical damage to the spine or brain, whereas French and British scholars, notably Jean-Martin Charcot and Herbert Page, insisted that some symptoms could be caused by hysteria (now known as conversion disorder).\n\nErichsen observed that those most likely to be injured in a railway crash were those sitting with their backs to the acceleration. This is the same injury mechanism found in whiplash. As with automobile accidents, railway and airplane accidents are now known to cause posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychosomatic symptoms in addition to physical trauma.\n\n"}

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologised for the incident in March 2013, which he said was necessitated by the Syrian civil war. The incident also drew attention to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, which was condemned. Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon called for a full investigation and urged Israel to provide a full explanation. Many countries called for an international investigation and civilian protests erupted around the world.\nFour countries downgraded their diplomatic relations with Israel and/or withdrew ambassadors: Ecuador, Nicaragua, South Africa, and Turkey. Twelve Latin American countries condemned Israeli actions: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. Israel had developed significant bilateral relationships with seven of them. Twenty-three European countries condemned or protested Israeli actions: Albania, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Israel was widely condemned in the Arab world. Thirteen non-Arab Asian countries condemned Israeli actions: Brunei, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Maldives, North Korea, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Uzbekistan. Israel was also condemned by: Australia, Kenya, New Zealand and South Africa. Eighteen countries expressed regret over the loss of life: Israel, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Canada, Czech Republic, Croatia, Egypt, Estonia, Greece, Holy See, India, Ireland, Japan, Sri Lanka, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay. Unofficial responses included civilian protests against Israeli action following reports of the deaths aboard the \"MV Mavi Marmara\".\n\nThe Turkish government and the İHH were also criticised. Several journalists accused Turkey of aligning itself with Iran, Syria, Hamas and Hezbollah, and expressed concern over the contribution of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and his government to fueling public rage. Pro-Israeli rallies took place in Los Angeles, Miami, Vienna, Great Britain, Brussels and Israel.\n\n\nAfrican Union (\"See below\").\n\nThe Southeast European Cooperation Process, at a meeting of the 13 member countries in June 2010, condemned Israel's raid and demanded an impartial, independent and internationally credible investigation.\n\n\nThe Australian Jewish Democratic Society said, \"Unless the Israeli government can convincingly back up its claims that the Gaza aid convoy was not a project for delivering humanitarian aid to Gaza, but in reality a front for violent action, it invites the condemnation of everyone who supports negotiated conflict resolution and reinforces the view that Israel's professed support for human rights is a sham.\"\n\nB'Tselem demanded that an independent and effective investigation conducted by non-military officials be launched immediately. B'Tselem stated that among the issues that needed investigating are whether proportionate force was used, whether the soldiers were trained and equipped to cope with this type of event, what open-fire regulations were given to soldiers, and whether alternative options were considered.\n\nJews for Justice for Palestinians said, \"Jews For Justice For Palestinians (the largest alternative voice of Jews in the UK or Europe) utterly condemns Israel's aggressive military interception of the peaceful Free Gaza aid flotilla. We hold Israel responsible for the tragic deaths and injuries which this action caused.\"\n\nGerman Jewish group Jewish Voices for a Just Peace decided to send a boat with school supplies and humanitarian aid to break the Gaza blockade. Kate Katzenstein-Leiterer, a leader of the group, said instead that they wanted to help preserve the State of Israel by showing that its current policies were wrong. Due to excessive interest, the group subsequently decided to arrange a second vessel.\n\nRabbi Dovid Feldman of Neturei Karta said: \"Authentic Orthodox Jewry worldwide decries unequivocally the cold-blooded slaughter carried out by the Zionist occupational forces against innocent, peaceful and freedom-loving noble activists committed to peace and human rights. This brutal attack took place in international waters on ships bearing humanitarian aid for our brethren, the Palestinian residents in the besieged Gaza Strip. It was an explicitly illegal act which breaches, in a serious manner, basic G-dly human rights, justice and law. This kind of behavior is, unfortunately, only to be expected from the Zionists. Their state's entire existence was built from the very start on Heresy, robbery and murder. They oppressed, murdered and expelled an entire people from its land.\" Adding, \"We find it imperative to clearly declare that the State of 'Israel' does not represent the Jewish people, and certainly not the Jewish religion. They have no right to speak in our name, nor in the name of the holy Torah. They profane the Holy Land with their abominations, slaughters and countless other actions that emanate from this illegitimate State. Furthermore, the actual existence of this State is illegitimate as the holy Torah strictly and explicitly forbids any Jewish rule over the Holy Land.\" Neturei Karta protests took place in Ottawa, Montral, Washington, D.C., New York City, Jerusalem and London. Neturei Karta Rabbis visited the injured in Turkey.\n\n\n\nThroughout 31 May, demonstrators gathered in the Middle East, Europe, North America and South Asia following the attack.\n\nIn Turkey, more than ten thousand people gathered to protest in Taksim Square in central Istanbul on the night of 31 May 2010. Hundreds of protesters then tried to storm the Israeli consulate in Istanbul. A second day of protests took place across Turkey; protestors marched in front of Istanbul's Israeli consulate, and several people were arrested in Ankara after encountering police in front of the Israeli Embassy there. On 1 June, Azerbaijani protesters gathered outside the Turkish embassy in Baku to condemn the Israeli attack. The protesters were carrying the Azerbaijani and Turkish flags. They also carried placards saying \"Israel is a barbarian\" and \"Israel is a murderer,\" and chanted slogans such as \"Azerbaijan and Turkey: one nation, two states\", \"Turkey's grief is Azerbaijan's grief\" and \"Down with Israel\". The protesters stated their support for the Turkish government and people.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, leftist and rightist demonstrators clashed on 5 June 2010, as more than 6,000 citizens gathered to protest the Israeli raid against the aid convoy.\n\nDuring a demonstration at a checkpoint between Israel and the West Bank, which involved stone-throwing by Palestinian youths, Israeli soldiers fired tear gas canisters at demonstrators. An art student from New York, who according to a witness was not involved in any violence, lost an eye when one of the canisters fractured parts of her skull.\n\nIn the Arab world, thousands marched in condemnation on the streets of Baghdad. Thousands of Egyptians also rallied to request that Cairo's Israeli ambassador be expelled and that the government open the Gaza border. There were also demonstrations in Damascus, Amman, and Beirut. While Palestinians in the West Bank clashed with Israeli security forces who responded with tear gas. Several hundred Arab protestors in Israel were arrested in Umm al-Fahm as the demonstrations turned violent. Protests were also held in the Arab cities of Acre, Sakhnin, Arabe and Shfaram, although there was no violence reported. A spontaneous demonstration also took place in Nazareth as Israeli security forces prepared to face an anticipated wave of violence. Demonstration were also held in Sana'a.\n\nOn 1 June 2010, in Malaysia, a man performed a personal protest before the United States embassy at Jalan Tun Razak when he \"slashed himself with a penknife on the thighs and chest\" to express his disapproval of the Israeli attack. He was bundled away to a hospital before the knife reached his neck. Protests were held across Pakistan by journalists, political parties, and college students. The Lahore Press Club called for the release of all detained persons, and called the raid an \"act of terrorism\". They accused Israel of violating international law, and demanded an urgent explanation of the matter. They also demanded the Pakistani government to secure the release of the Pakistanis arrested. Protests were also held in Jakarta and other cities across Indonesia. Demonstrations were being organised in New Delhi and other Indian cities to condemn the action.\n\nIn Greece, thousands of protesters marched on the Israeli Embassy in Athens, sparking clashes with police, the deployment of tear gas, five arrests and many injuries. Tear gas was also used in Paris to disperse the thousands of people who waved Palestinian and Turkish flags beside the Israeli Embassy. Twenty-one cities in Sweden, including Gothenburg and Malmö, held demonstrations, with thousands of protesters clutching Palestinian flags as they marched on the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm, while speakers expressed their \"disgust and dismay\". In Norway, approximately 2,000 demonstrators gathered peacefully in front of the Israeli Embassy in Oslo, while chanting slogans and calling for a \"boycott of Israel\" and closure of the Israeli Embassy. In Italy, there were protests in many cities, including Rome, where one speaker said the situation was \"extremely serious and has no precedent whatsoever in the history of international diplomacy\". In the United Kingdom, over a thousand protesters rallied outside Downing Street and barricaded Whitehall on 31 May.

Similar scenes were seen in Australia, where thousands gathered across the country to protest against the Israeli raid and the ongoing blockade of Gaza.\n\nOn 4 June, there were protests in Ireland and Malaysia. The Israeli embassy in Dublin was blockaded by dozens of people, causing its closure for the day but authorities deemed it a peaceful protest and no arrests were made. Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was among protesters who gathered outside the US embassy along Jalan Tun Razak in Kuala Lumpur, disrupting traffic for several hours. On 5 June further demonstrations were organised in the United Kingdom, with the Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign leading a three-thousand strong march in Edinburgh. In London thousands marched from Downing Street to the Israeli embassy to express their outrage at Israeli actions.\n\nOn 7 June 2010, approximately 200 mostly Muslim students threw stones at a group of Israelis while chanting \"Murderers\", and subsequently broke the window of the police car that they took refuge in. One of the Israelis was injured. The incident occurred at the start of the Spain-Israel Chamber of Commerce's conference at Madrid's Autonomous University. Following the violence, the university called off the conference due to safety concerns. According to Spanish media, the organizers had changed the conference's venue at the last minute due to concerns about potential violence but the protestors discovered the new location and stormed in while chanting, \"Murderers, murderers. Get out of Gaza\" and \"Freedom to the Palestinian people\".\n\nMany pro-Israeli rallies took place within the country, including by Sderot residents, in Qiryat Shmona and student rallies in the Technion, University of Haifa, Ben Gurion University, Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University. The rallies included hundreds of demonstrators waving the flag of Israel and chanting slogans in support of the IDF and Shayetet 13. A large and fierce protest was held in front of the Turkish embassy, which included slogans such as \"Shayetet 13, we are with you,\" \"We are all the IDF,\" \"Cold weapons kill.\" Protesters also accused Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of \"supporting terrorism\" and equated him with Osama Bin-Laden and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. They also chanted, \"The [Gaza] flotilla is burning,\" while carrying signs reading, \"Ahmadinejad=Erdogan\". The organizers of the embassy protest described themselves as young zionists.\n\nIn Los Angeles about 1000 demonstrators were protesting in front of the Turkish Consulate on 1 June in support of Israel. A Jewish high school student was seen walking through a crowd of anti-Israeli protesters alone, carrying a large Israeli flag. Police officers feared for his safety, and escorted him to protect him from potential attacks. On 6 June, demonstrators rallied to show solidarity with Israel at the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles. Notable attendees included Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Republican gubernatorial candidate Steve Poizner, actor Jon Voight, Republican Senate contender Chuck DeVore, Representative Brad Sherman and Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Los Angeles City Controller Wendy Greuel, City Council members Paul Koretz and Janice Hahn, Judea Pearl, and David Pine of Americans for Peace Now.

On 6 June, a rally was held in Brussels.\n\nThe National Union of Israeli Students planned to send a Kurdish Freedom Flotilla. According to Boaz Torporovsky, President of the Student Union, the plan is to send a flotilla of ships \"to deliver much-needed humanitarian assistance to the Kurds of Turkey\".\n\nIsraeli Arab members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, received numerous death threats after the incident. A bus driver hired by the Israeli military to transport soldiers put up a sign on the bus saying: \"Shayetet 13, shame on you. Why did you kill so few?\"\n\nA Rasmussen Reports national telephone poll in the United States of 1000 voters found that 49% of respondents blame pro-Palestinian activists on the Gaza bound aid ships for the deaths that resulted. 19% blamed Israel and 32% were not sure. 51% of those polled thought that Israel should allow an international investigation into the incident, while 25% agreed with Israel's refusal.\n\nA Yougov survey found that 55% of the Britons polled believed Israel had overreacted, 27% didn't know and 18% thought they'd acted in self-defence. When asked about an international investigation, an overwhelming 74% believed it should be conducted by an international group. 4% thought it should be led by Israel, 12% didn't know, and 11% thought an inquiry shouldn't be held as it was a distraction from peace negotiations.\n\nJewish Voices for a Just Peace, a group of German Jews belonging to the European Jews for a Just Peace that plans to send a boat with humanitarian aid to break the Gaza blockade, has received a large number of request to travel with the ship, and is searching for a second vessel to accommodate additional participants.\n\nIn Ireland, Lord Mayor of Cork Dara Murphy opened a book of condolence.\n\nFour trucks carrying tents, blankets and 13 power generators were donated by Russia and Oman.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting at the request of Turkey, during which the Turkish foreign minister stated \"Israel must be held accountable for its crimes\" (prior to the meeting, the Palestinian ambassador to the UN called for an independent Security Council investigation). While the British ambassador said Israel should end the Gaza blockade and take steps for an investigation, the US deputy permanent representative supported the Israeli position that humanitarian aid should have gone by \"accepted international mechanisms\", and the Israeli deputy permanent representative said the flotilla was not humanitarian but had a mission of breaking the blockade.\n\nThe United States directly intervened to prevent the United Nations Security Council's statement, which requested an \"impartial\" investigation of the deaths and condemned those \"acts\" that led to it, from resembling that drafted by Turkey, the Palestinians and Arab states, which called for condemnation \"in the strongest terms\" and an independent international inquiry. 12 hours of negotiations were required to come up with a statement that suited all.\n\nAs a result of the emergency meeting that went into the early hours of the morning, the council agreed condemn the acts that resulted in the deaths and injuries aboard the \"Mavi Marmara\". They also called for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards. This was different from what Turkey and the Arab states were demanded – an independent international investigation—leaving open the possibility of who would conduct the investigation.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution by 32 votes to 3, with a number of abstentions, in which it condemned in the strongest terms the outrageous attack by the Israeli forces that resulted in the killing and injuring of many innocent civilians from different countries, and decided to dispatch an independent international fact finding mission to investigate violations of international law resulting from the Israeli attack.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28659519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28659519", "title": "Respect (The Bill)", "text": "Respect (The Bill)\n\n\"Respect\" is the two-part series finale of the United Kingdom's longest-running police procedural television drama series, \"The Bill\". The episodes were written by David Harsent and directed by Reza Moradi, and aired on ITV1 on 24 and 31 August 2010. The series finale, and the final scene, were specially written to include all 17 current cast members.\n\n\"The Bill\" was a long-running police drama set in and around the fictional Sun Hill police station in south London. The show's focus was on the work and lives of the officers, led by Superintendent Jack Meadows (Simon Rouse) and Inspector Dale \"Smithy\" Smith (Alex Walkinshaw). Much of the officers' time is spent on the fictional Jasmine Allen estate, the setting for much of \"Respect\".\n\nSmithy is called to the Jasmine Allen Estate where he discovers a dying teenager, identified as Liam Martin, who has been stabbed by gang members. Investigations into his murder lead the team to Jasmine Harris (Faye Daveney), a previous informant of DC Mickey Webb (Chris Simmons). Investigations reveal that she lured Liam to where he was killed and she is arrested. In interview, Jasmine leads officers to Carlos Miller (Lewis Chase), who is arrested and claims that he killed Liam in self-defence. Jasmine is released on bail, against the advice of DC Webb, who believes that she is in danger from other gang members. Upon her return to the estate, a gang of boys forces Jasmine into a warehouse, where she is beaten and gang raped. A gunshot is heard, and the episode concludes with police arriving at the scene.\n\nFollowing the murder of Liam Martin and the gang-rape of Jasmine Harris for talking to the police, uniformed officers arrive at the flat of Gary Wilson (Darragh Mortell), where they arrest him and Colin Simmons (Jumayne Hunte). As Meadows and Detective Inspector Neil Manson (Andrew Lancel) question the suspects, Smithy visits Jasmine in hospital, where she refuses to give a statement and prosecute. Due to a lack of evidence, the team are forced to release Simmons, Wilson and Carlos Miller. Jasmine is discharged from hospital, and still refuses to give a statement. However, as the team sees fit to give up, much to the anger of Mickey, CSE Eddie Olosunje (Jason Barnett) discovers that the gunshot fired at the end of the previous episode was fired upwards, and so possibly to alert passers-by, and to stop the gang-rape. Due to CCTV footage, the officers believe that gang member, Derek Bailey (Femi Wilhelm) fired the shot, and set out to find him as a potential witness. They pull in courier, Ruby Collier (Shahnequa Duprey). She initially refuses to help them, but sends Mickey a text message that leads uniform to Bailey's location. Sergeant Stone (Sam Callis) ascends to the top storey, where he discovers Bailey dying from a gunshot wound, inflicted by Gary Wilson, who holds Stone at gunpoint, when he attempts to help Bailey. Armed police officers arrive, and prepare to fire at Stone, who tussels with Wilson. A gunshot is heard, but nobody is harmed. Bailey is taken to hospital, and Wilson is arrested. After talking to Smithy and Mickey, Jasmine finally agrees to a statement, which helps to convict Wilson and the others of gang-rape. However, Jack is able to elicit a confession to Liam Martin's murder from Gary Wilson.\n\n\"Respect\" concludes at a press conference, at which Meadows briefs reporters on the investigation and Wilson's confession. He finishes and rises to leave, before changing his mind and giving an impromptu speech on respect. He tells the assembled reporters and police officers that \"somewhere along the line, someone changed the meaning. You earn respect these days through violence. Power. Fear. Money. The blade of a knife.\" He goes on to praise his team, Smith and Stone in particular, concluding that \"today was one of the good days\". The scene changes to a walkthough Sun Hill with Mickey handing witness statements to Stevie, then he and Terry pinch Eddie's bag of crisps. After teasing Mel and Kirsty, Smithy and Stone leave the police station to get a pint and they ask Mickey if he would like to join them. After lying to Max about going to the pub, Jo, Roger, Ben, and Leon bring in a stag party from the Bellcot Arms. As the two depart, Smithy has the last ever line, \"Yeah, come on. Let's do it!\", a nod to the pilot episode \"Woodentop\", which opens with PC Jim Carver telling himself \"OK Carver, let's do it!\". The final shot is of the exterior of Sun Hill station, with Neil and Grace, holding hands as they leave, and Jack going to his car to drive home, and a dedication message to the men and women of the Metropolitan Police Service past and present appears, before the credits roll, to a mixture of the new theme music, and the original one, \"Overkill\".\n\nTo \"sign off\" the series, the producers considered that they could \"blow everything up\" but ruled that out because they wanted to do something that \"celebrated what The Bill has always been about which is ordinary people wearing a uniform and taking responsibility for society\". The producers decided that they wanted to symbolise that \"life goes on\" and end the series with \"their heads held high\".\n\nIn the finale, Callum Stone (Sam Callis) has to chase a suspect using one of the panda cars whilst Inspector Smith (Alex Walkinshaw) follows on foot. The dangerous parts of the car pursuit were carried out by stuntman Andy Smart, once Smart had finished filming, small car-mounted cameras filmed Callis driving before the shots were then cut together with those filmed by Smart. Later, when he finds hostage Derek Bailey, Stone comes face-to-face with Gary Wilson, the armed criminal responsible for Jasmine's rape and Liam Martin's murder. The Bill does not use extras for any scenes involving armed police; so, for this scene, the armed police surrounding the flat were played by \"men who have been trained in the use of firearms and know what they're doing with a gun\". The show has a stock of thirty replica weapons identical to those used by the Metropolitan Police although they are incapable of firing any shots. To prepare for the scene, a bag of fake blood is wrapped around the hostage's stomach and is punctured shortly before filming begins so when the actor clutches his stomach it will look as if he is bleeding.\n\nThe idea for the series finale came after research showed that rape is used to punish girl gang members. Series Producer Tim Key says \"That is what \"The Bill\" has always done. It's held a mirror up to modern society and we wanted it to be like that right up until the final shot.\"\n\nThe final location shoot for the finale was carried out at a derelict estate in London which is due to be demolished. \"The Bill\" was always filmed on location in London whenever possible, \"to keep the show authentic\". Executive Producer Johnathan Young says \"We feel that London is a part of the show, it's a character within the show and we've really encouraged directors to look for graphic locations that give you a real sense of being part of a big metropolis\". Examples of these would include police chases by boat along the River Thames and helicopters aiding searches.\n\nThe police uniforms used in \"The Bill\" are authentic so when not in use they are locked away. The uniforms were originally bought from the police who agreed to buy the uniforms back when the series ended.\n\nThe final scene was a long take, filmed using a hand-held camera and featured 70 people in total. Of the final scene, Keys said that the producers knew they had to do \"something special\" but also wanted to show that \"life goes on\". To film the final scene, the cameraman had to keep the camera steady when following the characters going through the police station and then outside into the rear yard of the station where he stepped into a crane which then lifts to reveal the front of Sun Hill station. The shows producers were also included in the final scene, and played the part of journalists at the press conference hosted by Jack Meadows which Keys described as being \"eerie\" because \"you were sat there on the front row listening to Simon making a very moving speech that sums up the show and his time in it\".\n\nCritics were generally impressed with \"Respect\". \"The Belfast Telegraph\" called it \"hard-hitting and poignant—a gritty two-parter that ensured the much-loved show went out with a bang.\" The reviewer went on to suggest that the episode was \"a subtle two-fingers salute to the men in suits\" at ITV who made the decision to cancel \"The Bill\", a sentiment shared by Sam Wollaston of \"The Guardian\", who suggested that the Superintendent Jack Meadows' final speech, on the subject of respect, may have been partly directed at the \"ITV top brass\". Benji Wilson, writing for \"The Daily Telegraph\", compared \"The Bill\" to \"the pensioner who still turns up for work\", saying that viewers \"tend to appreciate \"The Bill\" simply for staggering on and on, rather than for the quality of its output\", though went on to call \"Respect\" \"a hugely potent – and distinctly British – piece of drama.\"\n\nIn Australia, the two parts of \"Respect\" were shown on 9 and 16 October respectively. Both instalments ranked first in their timeslot and fifth for the day.\n\n"}
{"id": "2649323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2649323", "title": "Runaways (musical)", "text": "Runaways (musical)\n\nRunaways is a musical which was written, composed, choreographed and directed by Elizabeth Swados, about the lives of children who run away from home and live on the city streets. The characters were taken from workshops conducted by Swados with real-life runaways in the late 1970s.\n\nSwados took her idea for a musical with the theme of running away \"from home, from a boyfriend, from a predator... from yourself\" to Joseph Papp, who agreed to produce it. She looked for the children who would be in the musical in various places in New York City, such as a community center, and \"little by little, we built a world where runaways came together, told their stories, and acted out the hardships they endured.\" Swados did research for her project as she gathered the cast, and some in the cast were actual runaways. The show was done in a series of songs, monologues, scenes, poems, and dances.\n\nThe musical premiered off-Broadway on February 21, 1978 at the Public Theater Cabaret as presented by the New York Shakespeare Festival. It moved to Broadway at the Plymouth Theatre on May 13, 1978 and closed on December 31st, 1978 after 12 previews and 274 performances. The director and choreographer was Elizabeth Swados, with scenic design by Douglas W. Schmidt and Woods Mackintosh, costume design by Hilary Rosenfeld, and lighting design by Jennifer Tipton. In 2007, a re-worked concert version of the show produced by Jamie McGonnigal and directed by Rodney Hicks played at Joe's Pub.\nThe orchestra consisted of Piano and Toy Piano, String Bass, Congas, Timbales, Bongos, Bell Sirens and Others, Trap Set, Triangle, Glass and Ratchet, Saxophone and Flutes, and Guitar (played by Elizabeth Swados).\n\nThe musical was presented in 2016 as part of New York City Center's Encores! Off-Center's concert series. It was done under the artistic direction of Jeanine Tesori and the direction of Sam Pinkleton. It was performed July 6 to 9, with a cast of 25 young performers between the ages of 12-20: Frenie Acoba, Sumaya Bouhbal, Kenneth Cabral, Maxwell Cabral, Taylor Caldwell, Sophia Anne Caruso, Xavier Casimir, Joshua DeJesus, Adleesa Edwards, Aidan Gemme, Reyna Guerra, Matthew Gumley, Christina Jimenez, Kylie McNeill, Cele Pahucki, Sam Poon, Siena Rafter, Claudia Ramirez, Ren, Mj Rodriguez, Deandre Sevon, Jeremy Shinder, Ripley Sobo, Chris Sumpter and Maxwell Vice. Elizabeth Swados was supposed to have been involved with this production, had she not died earlier in 2016. Tesori said: \"Since we can’t do 'Runaways' with her, we’ll now do it for her.\"\n\n\n28 \"multi racial, multi ethnic\" children explore the \"fragmented\" life of the runaway in an inner city. Through songs, monologues and poems the children examine and explain why they are runaways. They are abused, come from broken families, or are in an orphanage. The children show a range of emotions, and are seen as victims but also \"perpetrators\". They \"plead with their families and society 'Let Me Be A Kid Again.'\"\n\n\nAccording to Cecil A. Smith, \"It was a novel show, even for a period of musical theatre that sought novelty. Angry, disturbing, and ultimately too prosaic for sustained musical flight, it was complete proof that Elizabeth Swados had new plans for the musical and that she had the talent to realize them.\n\nHarold Clurman wrote: \"Though the show offers a number of attractive features, only a few of them are actually congruent with its theme...There are...a few charming numbers: one of them is called 'Enterprise' derisive of our national fetish...The Swados music is utilitarian rather than lyrically or dramatically expressive-it is employed, as in the Japanese or Chinese theatres, as sound to call attention to signal moments...Even if I had liked more of the numbers than I did, I would still have thought 'too much show!' \".\n\n\"The New York Times\" reviewer wrote of the Public Theater production that the show was an \"inspired musical collage... [it] takes a harsh and uncompromising look at the world of runaways, but it is written and performed with great compassion.\" The music is \"disco, salsa, country and western and blues...Not just the songs, but the soliloquies and poems - some of them contributed by members of the cast - are also deeply personal...In all aspects 'Runaways' is a triumph.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "22551858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22551858", "title": "SIEV 36", "text": "SIEV 36\n\nSIEV 36 (Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel 36) was a vessel from Indonesia that exploded and sank off Ashmore Reef, Australia on 16 April 2009. The vessel, carrying 47 refugees and two crew, was intercepted by the Royal Australian Navy patrol boat early on 15 April. A boarding party secured the vessel, but failed to locate two canisters of petrol. Although it was intended to take the crew and passengers to Christmas Island for processing, a notice informing the crew that their vessel may be returned to Indonesia was presented, and the passengers were kept in the dark about their destination. While waiting for transportation to arrive, \"Albany\" and SIEV 36 sailed in a holding pattern, with the Indonesian boat taken in tow overnight. A second patrol boat, , arrived that evening, and was directed to provide a boarding party and take care of the vessel starting at 06:00 on 16 April.\n\n\"Childers\" boarding party arrived aboard SIEV 36 at 06:15. Shortly after, the passengers found the notice, and, assuming that they would be sent back to Indonesia, became agitated. Salt was poured into the boat's diesel engine, stalling it, and one of the petrol canisters was spread on the deck. Reinforcements were sent from \"Childers\" to restore control, and boarded shortly before the petrol was ignited; the resulting explosion tore the boat apart. RHIBs from the two patrol boats focused on recovering the nine Australian Defence Force personnel first, then began recovering others. Five passengers were killed, and many of the survivors were heavily burned; the two patrol boats sailed to the tanker \"Front Puffin\", from where the wounded were heli-lifted to hospitals ashore.\n\nAn investigation by the Northern Territory Police concluded in October 2009, finding that one or more of the refugees had spread and ignited the petrol, but charges could not be laid as there was no enough evidence to identify the individuals responsible. A separate investigation by the Northern Territory Coroner criticised the RAN for not finding the petrol canisters, failing to confiscate ignition sources, and the lack of information provided about the refugee's destination, although praised the actions of several Australian personnel in the aftermath of the explosion. The coroner found the crew as the cause of the sabotaged engine and the passengers as starting the fire, but was unable to identify individuals because of collusion by those involved to hide the information from the inquiry. Commendations were issued to all military personnel involved in the incident. One refugee was charged with obstructing the actions of two sailors trying to confiscate a lighter from him shortly before the explosion, and the two Indonesian crew were imprisoned for five years on people-smuggling charges.\n\nEarly on 15 April, the RAN patrol boat intercepted the diesel-powered fishing boat off Ashmore Reef. A boarding party was sent at 09:43, and boarded the vessel, designated \"Suspected Illegal Entry Vessel 36\" (the 36th vessel to enter Australian waters while carrying asylum seekers or other unauthorised arrivals since the 2001 Tampa Affair), without incident. The boat was carrying 46 Afghans, an Iraqi, and two Indonesian crew: all male adults. One of the passengers was able to serve as an interpreter, and spent the day helping the Australians by translating instructions and directions, and explaining the actions of the navy boarders. Although sabotage was a risk with SIEVs (in previous incidents, unauthorised arrivals had damaged their vessels or threatened to do so in an attempt to force authorities to take them to Australia), the passengers were allowed to keep cigarette lighters and matches, as removing peoples' ability to smoke would cause unnecessary agitation. The boarding party searched the vessel, but failed to identify a petrol-fuelled bilge pump and its fuel can, or a spare petrol canister in the bow hold.\n\nThe leader of the boarding party gave one of the Indonesian crew a K-6-4 notice, a mandatory notice stating the penalties for people smuggling, and which included text advising the crew to \"consider immediately returning to Indonesia with your passengers\". Although the passengers were to be taken to Christmas Island for processing, standard procedure was to only tell them that they would be taken to \"Australian authorities\". \"Albany\"s commander was advised that the amphibious warfare ship would arrive to collect those aboard SIEV 36 in about three days; anchoring the two vessels in Ashmore Lagoon or using the patrol boat to deliver them to Christmas Island were both ruled out, so a steaming party was embarked and the two vessels began sailing in a holding pattern. That evening, SIEV 36 was taken in tow by \"Albany\", in order to provide better surveillance and support during the night. Around the same time, arrived to provide support: the two captains agreed that \"Childers\" would spend the night on anti-fishing patrols, then return around 06:00 to relieve \"Albany\" on close surveillance of SIEV 36.\n\nThe handover occurred on schedule, although officers aboard \"Childers\" were concerned that this was occurring almost two hours before sunrise. The replacement boarding party reached SIEV 36 at 06:15, and by 07:10, the towline to \"Albany\" had been dropped, and the vessel was following \"Childers\" under its own power. Although the leader of the new boarding party had been informed that there was an interpreter aboard, he did not use the man to relay directions or explain actions.\n\nShortly after the \"Childers\" boarding party arrived, the interpreter found the K-6-4 notice and told the others that this meant they would be forced back to Indonesia. The situation quickly deteriorated, with passengers shouting abuse at the Indonesian crew and the Australian steaming party. The military personnel aboard began indicating that SIEV 36 would be heading to Christmas Island, not Indonesia, but a few minutes later, the boat's engine stopped.\n\nAs the engine died the head of the boarding party began to smell petrol, and at 07:29, he radioed \"Childers\" for assistance. Shortly after the engine stopped, one of the passengers took the petrol canister from the forward hold and spread its contents over the deck. Another passenger began waving a cigarette lighter around, and two Australians grabbed him. A reinforcement boarding party arrived from \"Childers\" at 07:44, bringing the number of Australian personnel aboard SIEV 36 to nine.\n\nShortly after the explosion, \"Childers\" began dropping life rafts and flotation devices into the water, and lowered nets to assist anyone climbing aboard. However, most of the passengers were unable to swim the short distance to the floats or the patrol boat, and stayed on the burning wreck until one of the Australians began urging them into the water.\n\nIn the water, the RHIBs' priority were the Australian military personnel, to the point where while trying to pull a Royal Australian Air Force medic from the water, a member of the boat crew kicked at an Afghani man to stop him from preventing her rescue. By 07:58, all nine personnel had been recovered. Both Indonesian crew were rescued, along with 42 of the passengers. Three bodies were recovered, with another two never found.\n\nAt 09:58, \"Childers\" left the scene to transport the worst-burned survivors to Darwin. Shortly after, the ship was told to divert to \"Front Puffin\", a tanker permanently moored in the Timor Sea as a gas processing platform, where helicopters would relay the wounded to hospitals ashore: cutting a 25-hour voyage down to 4 hours. The patrol boat reached \"Front Puffin\" at 14:14, with the first burn victims lifted aboard the tanker about 20 minutes later, a helicopter bearing eight doctors arriving around sunset. \"Albany\", which had remained at the explosion site for another hour before departing, arrived later.\n\nThe 42 surviving passengers were all found to be legitimate asylum seekers, and granted permanent protection visas in October 2009.\n\nOn 6 May 2009, the Commander Joint Operations, Lieutenant General Mark Evans, AO, DSC, appointed Brigadier Don Higgins, AM, as an Inquiry Officer, pursuant to the provisions of the \"Defence (Inquiry) Regulations 1985\", to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the arrival, apprehension and boarding of SIEV 36, and the response of ADF personnel to the explosion in SIEV 36 (but not the cause or circumstances of the explosion itself). Brigadier Higgins was assisted by two Assistant Inquiry Officers, Commander Bob Heffey, CSM, RAN, the then Commanding Officer, HMAS CAIRNS, who had significant patrol boat experience, and Lieutenant Commander Paul W. Kerr, RANR, a Navy legal officer with significant inquiry experience. Brigadier Higgins' Report contained nine Findings and 59 Recommendations, including recommendations for recognition of particular personnel. The Report concluded:\n\nNorthern Territory Police investigation concluded in October 2009. They concluded that one or more of the passengers spread petrol and ignited it, causing the explosion. Charges could not be laid because there was not enough evidence to identify individuals, with the possibility that the perpetrator(s) were among those killed, or alternately, those who knew the truth were concealing it. The two Indonesian crew were sentenced to five years imprisonment on people-smuggling charges, while the passenger who fought with the Australians trying to confiscate his lighter was charged with obstructing the sailors' actions.\n\nMost of the passengers denied or made claims of forgetfulness about what they had told the police shortly after the incident, hampering the efforts of the following inquiry. The Northern Territory Coroner concluded that the Australian personnel failed in their duties on several counts, by not finding and securing the petrol canisters, not confiscating ignition sources, and not informing the passengers of their intended destination. He believed that the K-6-4 notice was inflammatory, and its presentation was inappropriate in the situation (despite it being mandated for all SIEVs). The inquiry found that those aboard the SIEV had planned to incapacitate the boat: the crew by pouring salt into the diesel engine, and the passengers by spreading and igniting petrol, but the coroner was unable to identify individuals responsible for the petrol ignition because the passengers \"colluded with each other and decided as a group to lie to this Inquest\". The coroner recommended that three of the Australian personnel be recognised for their actions during the explosion's aftermath and the voyage to \"Front Puffin\"; the Australian Defence Force took it a step further, with six personnel awarded individual commendations, and both ships' companies receiving group commendations.\n\n"}

The first 32 issues were published by the founder of the journal, Mirza Jahangir Khan (1870-1908), an Iranian author and journalist. With its liberal as well as revolutionary orientation \"Sur-e Esrafil\" contributed significantly to support the Constitutional Revolution. The editor published articles criticising strongly the high-class and the social situation of the country that time and discussing controversial between conservatives and modern religion. But the journal became well-known and famous due to its literary satirical elements. Ali Akbar Dehkhoda (1879-1956) was responsible for the satirical articles of the column „Charand-o Parand“ („Nonsense“). He had a simple linguistic style in contrast to the rather literary style addressing the educated people. In this way he wanted to reach the majority of the population and to address the daily problems of the common people.\n\nDuring the repressions and on the command of Mohammad Ali Shah the journal was finally suspended in June 1908. Mirza Jahangir Khan was arrested and executed. In January 1909 \"Sur-e Esrafil\" was revived under Dekhoda who published further 3 issues of the journal from Switzerland.\n\n"}

The Festival's format centers around its Hip-Hop Performance Day and includes a variety of affiliated hip hop cultural events that occur in the days leading up to the festival. Besides its music programming, the festival also features a \"Family Day\" segment that has music, performances, demonstrations and seminars from a host of family centric organizations.\n\nIn 2012, the Festival continued its new format of programming with “Busta & Friends” and topped Festival history with a record-breaking 30,000+ in attendance (20,000 on its Performance Day). Busta Rhymes & Friends would feature classic hits performed with Spliff Star and a surprise line-up that included Buckshot of Black Moon, Smif –N-Wessun, Lil’ Fame of M.O.P., Slick Rick, Reek Da Villain. The icing on the cake was a Leaders Of The New School reunion with Charlie Brown and Dinco D which was 19 years in the making. The night ended with L.O.N.S performing “Scenario” and bringing Phife and Q-Tip (musician) out just as the cops killed the power.\n\nAccording to Time Out, \"(The BHF is) (d)ifferent from the bigger hip-hop packages like Rock the Bells that will be touring the U.S. all summer, this is a show that seems purely for New York, and it affords an opportunity for the artists to give back... Local businesses also showed their support, with booths ranging from Brooklyn Brewery to FLUD Watches and Hoodman Clothing.\" In 2010, NY1 interviewed Hip-Hop artist Torae who said \"It's just awesome, you know, for new, upcoming artists like myself to be out here and perform with legends and get to touch people from young to old, every race.\" Steele (rapper) of the hip-hop duo Smif-N-Wessun added \"It's packed -- no violence -- so it dispels all the myths that hip-hop brings violence and stuff. It's beautiful out there, it's young kids out there, it's older people out there. It's people from all walks.\" \n\nThe BHF is owned by Brooklyn Bodega, which uses the proceeds from the festival to support year-round cultural programming including but not limited to: the blogazine and online home BrooklynBodega.com, and most recently The Bodega Agency, our boutique marketing and branding operation.\n\nThe Festival has been held yearly since 2005 when it was founded by Wes Jackson, entrepreneur and current Executive Director and President of Brooklyn Bodega and co-founders, Gregory Trani and Douglas Nettingham.

{"id": "7955522", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7955522", "title": "The Cat in the Hat (TV special)", "text": "The Cat in the Hat (TV special)\n\nThe Cat in the Hat is an American animated musical television special first aired on CBS on July 4, 1971, based on the 1957 Dr. Seuss children's book of the same name, and produced by DePatie–Freleng Enterprises. With voices by Allan Sherman and prolific vocal performer Daws Butler, this half-hour special is a loose adaptation with added musical sequences.\n\nAs the story opens, it is too rainy and cold to play outside, so Sally and Conrad sit bored and look out the window. Their mom announces her departure, tells them to have fun, and says she'll return at 3:30 sharp. While their mom is out at a job interview, they have no other choice but to wish they had something to do.\n\nThe mysterious, quirky Cat in the Hat suddenly enters with a bump and fools around a bit. The family goldfish named \"Karlos K. Krinklebine\", demands that he must leave, but instead the Cat plays a game which he calls \"Up, Up, Up, With a Fish\", placing the fishbowl on top of a stack of bubbles. The children notice that the Cat is making the house a little untidy, and Conrad recalls their mom's projected return at 3:30. Noting their objections, the Cat bows to the voice of the majority and dejectedly states he's going to Siberia. Immediately after leaving, however, the Cat bursts back in claiming that his \"moss-covered three-handled family gredunza\" has been stolen. The Cat accuses Karlos of being the thief, and sings a ballad about the loss of his treasured keepsake.\n\nThe Cat then leads the kids on a search for the missing gredunza using his method of \"Calculatus Eliminatus,\" in which random numbers and letters are drawn anywhere the gredunza should be to mark that they have already checked there. This makes a mess of everything, and Karlos once again demands that the Cat must leave. Ostensibly to gain sympathy, the Cat sings a pessimistic song to convey his low self-esteem, then puts Karlos to sleep by singing a lullaby. Having made a miraculous recovery from his bout of depression, the Cat brings out Thing One and Thing Two to aid in the search for the gredunza, singing to the kids that they can find \"anything under the sun.\" Instead of being productive, however, the Things play a variety of sports using Karlos's fishbowl, noting that every house they visit has a pessimistic fish who \"always tries to flatten the fun\". Karlos becomes angry and accuses the Cat of not being a real cat, and his hat of not being a real hat. But the Cat indignantly asserts his legitimacy by singing his name in several languages, some real and some fictional. The tune becomes so catchy that everyone, even Karlos, joins in and contributes, telling the Cat that in Russian he is a \"chapka in a shlyapa\". (An interesting point to note is that in the Russian portion of the song, the Cat describes himself as a \"chapka in a shlyapa\", which translates to \"\"hat\" in a hat\"; in Russian, the most common word for \"cat\" is \"koschka\".)\n\nAs the song ends, Karlos spots Mom coming home. The Cat exits, leaving behind an extremely messy house. He quickly returns, however, using a motorized vehicle to tidy things up. He then departs, hinting that he may return someday. Just as he departs through the back door, Mom walks in through the front door; she asks the kids how their day was, and then tells them that she just saw a cat in a hat \"going down the street with a moss-covered three-handled family gredunza\". The exact identity of the item has never been revealed, but this indicates that the gredunza was never really lost, and the Cat simply wanted an excuse to have more fun. Sally and Conrad look out the window much as they did at the beginning of the special, and watch as the Cat walks off to his next adventure.\n\nThe plot of the special differs significantly from the original book. Among the many deviations, the sequence in the book where the Cat balances all sorts of objects while standing on a ball, only to overdo it and come crashing down, is left out. The closest equivalent is the fishbowl and bubbles sequences.\n\nAlso differing is the role of Thing 1 and Thing 2; in the original book, they were simply things the Cat brought along to demonstrate fun, but in this special, they are commissioned to help find the cat's \"moss-covered three-handled family gredunza.\" The vocabulary used in the special is also of a higher level than the book, though still in Seuss' trademark rhyme.\n\nThe special was originally released as a VHS videocassette on the CBS/Fox Video label's Playhouse Video imprint in 1989. It was later released as part of the \"Dr. Seuss Sing-Along Classics\" release from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment with CBS Video and Fox Kids Video in the mid 90's. It was later released on DVD by Universal Studios Home Entertainment on October 7, 2003. Warner Home Video released the special on Blu-ray and DVD on August 7, 2012.\n\nAlthough the original book's sequel \"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back\" did not receive an animated adaptation, the character went on to appear in several more Dr. Seuss specials. In 1973, there came \"Dr. Seuss on the Loose\", where Sherman reprised his role as The Cat in the Hat. Here, The Cat in the Hat appeared in bridging sequences where he introduced animated adaptations of three other Dr. Seuss stories: \"The Sneetches\", \"The Zax\" and \"Green Eggs and Ham\". In 1982's \"The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat\", the character, now voiced by Mason Adams (Sherman had died shortly after \"Dr. Seuss on the Loose\" finished production), meets the title character of \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas!\" and sets out to reform his new green adversary. In 1995, the Cat appeared again, this time with the voice of Henry Gibson, to narrate \"Daisy-Head Mayzie\", a special based on a posthumously published Dr. Seuss book. In 1997, a puppet version of the Cat starred in \"The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss\", where he was voiced by Bruce Lanoil and Martin P. Robinson. \"The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!\", an educational animated series based on the \"Random House Library\" series, premiered in September 2010; the Cat is voiced by Martin Short.\n\n\nThe production began at Chuck Jones' MGM Animation Studio in the late 1960s after the studio had finished \"The Phantom Tollbooth\" and another Dr. Seuss special, \"Horton Hears a Who!\". After MGM stopped animation production and closed down its animation department for good in 1970, production was moved to DePatie–Freleng Enterprises (marking the company's first Dr. Seuss television special), which was run by Jones' fellow Warner Bros. Cartoons alumnus Friz Freleng and WB's last original production executive David DePatie.\n\nAlthough Chuck Jones and his staff were retained by DePatie–Freleng in the production of the special, Jones left the studio and did not work on any other Seuss projects after \"The Cat in the Hat\". Other staff members that have worked with Jones such as Dean Elliott and Maurice Noble eventually stopped working on Seuss projects also. DePatie and Freleng were credited together as executive producers, while Jones was credited as producer with Seuss (under his actual name). For the next three Dr. Seuss animation specials, Freleng and Seuss (again using his real name) were credited as producers, although separately.\n\nDePatie–Freleng animated a new Cat in the Hat Productions logo for this special, which would be used in the next three specials. The pace and rhyming sequences of several of the songs (particularly \"Calculatus Eliminatus\") led many to believe that they were composed by Sherman, since they closely resemble his earlier song parodies, however only Seuss is credited.\n\n"}

The song also appeared on the band's first full-length album, \"Frogstomp\" (27 March 1995). It won the 1995 ARIA Music Award for Single of the Year and Highest Selling Single. The track was written by the band's lead vocalist, lead guitarist and front man, Daniel Johns, and their drummer-percussionist, Ben Gillies. It was produced and engineered by Phil McKellar at national radio station, Triple J's studios for SBS-TV's show, \"Nomad\", which aired on 16 June 1994. After the broadcast the band were signed to the Murmur label – a Sony Music subsidiary – which subsequently issued the \"Tomorrow\" EP.\n\n\"Tomorrow\" became a breakthrough hit for Silverchair when it reached number one on the ARIA Singles Chart in October and remained at the top position for six weeks. In the United States a re-recorded version was issued in the following year and also peaked at number one on both the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks and the Album Rock Tracks charts; it made No. 28 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Airplay chart. In the United Kingdom, the song made No. 59 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1995. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, \"Tomorrow\" won three awards in the categories 'Single of the Year', 'Highest Selling Single' and 'Breakthrough Artist – Single'; they won two further awards for \"Frogstomp\".\n\nBen Gillies (on drums and percussion) and Daniel Johns (on lead vocals and lead guitar) co-wrote \"Tomorrow\" when they were performing with Chris Joannou (on bass guitar) as Innocent Criminals. Innocent Criminals entered YouthRock, a competition for school-based bands, in 1994. Early in that year they recorded demos of \"Acid Rain\", \"Cicada\", \"Pure Massacre\" and \"Tomorrow\" at Platinum Sound Studios. Johns recalled making the demos \"[w]e had just recorded that at a really cheap studio ... It cost about $75. We weren't in there for more than an hour. The version we entered went for about six minutes\".\n\nIn April 1994, the band won a national band competition called Pick Me, using their demo of \"Tomorrow\". The competition was conducted by the SBS TV show \"Nomad\" and Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) alternative radio station Triple J.\n\nAs part of the prize, Triple J recorded the song and ABC filmed a video, which was aired on 16 June. For the video's broadcast, they had changed their name to Silverchair (styled as silverchair until 2002). On 16 September, their Triple J recording of \"Tomorrow\" was released as a four-track extended play with \"Acid Rain\", \"Blind\", and \"Stoned\". From late October, it spent six weeks at number-one on the ARIA Singles Chart. It also reached number one on the New Zealand Singles Chart in February 1995.\n\nIn 1995, a re-recorded version of \"Tomorrow\" (and a new music video) was made for the United States market, becoming the most played song on US modern rock radio that year. In the US it peaked at number one on both the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks and the Album Rock Tracks charts; it made No. 28 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Airplay chart.\n\nWhen asked about where the inspiration for \"Tomorrow\" came from, Johns said: That was on a TV show. There was this poor guy taking a rich guy through a hotel to experience the losses of the less fortunate than him. The rich guy is just complaining because he just wants to get out and the poor guy is saying you have to wait till tomorrow to get out. That's one of our least serious songs but it still has meaning to it.\n\nTwo different music videos were released to promote \"Tomorrow\". The original version was directed by Robert Hambling for SBS-TV show \"Nomad\", which was produced and directed from 1992 to 1994 by Kerry Negara. It was broadcast on 16 June 1994 as part of the group's prize for winning the Pick Me competition.\n\nThe second version was shown in the US and is directed by Mark Pellington. This video has been described as similar to the music video for the Pearl Jam song \"Jeremy\", also directed by Pellington. Like the \"Jeremy\" video, the US \"Tomorrow\" video includes: harsh lighting, especially on the face; various disturbing images, such as a pig eating money and shots of a spider-like creature; quick shifting between random images; and handwritten notes. The US version of \"Tomorrow\" received high rotation on MTV, which \"led to an abundance of radio requests\".\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the song made No. 59 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1995.\n\nOn 20 October 1995, at the ARIA Music Awards, \"Tomorrow\" won three categories: 'Single of the Year', 'Highest Selling Single' and 'Breakthrough Artist – Single'; the group won two further awards for their work on the related album, \"Frogstomp\". At the ceremony they performed a cover version of Radio Birdman's \"New Race\" with Tim Rogers (of You Am I) joining them on stage. Their trophies were collected by Josh Shirley, the young son of \"Frogstomp\"s producer, Kevin Shirley.\n\nAllmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the \"angst-ridden single\" as \"from the standard grunge formula\".\n\nIn February 2004 Australian rock musician Scott Owen of The Living End was asked for \"the most influential Australian music release\" and answered that it was Silverchair's \"Tomorrow\", he explained \"it taught kids that if you give it a go you have the chance to take on the world\".\n\nOn 9 December 1995 \"Tomorrow\" and \"Pure Massacre\" were performed by Silverchair on \"Saturday Night Live\", hosted by David Alan Grier.\n\n\"Tomorrow\" was used in \"The Mystery of Morning Wood\", an episode on season six of \"Beavis and Butt-head\". At the start of the episode the two main characters are singing Boston's \"More Than a Feeling\", then concluded that the song was stupid and ended by stating how the video fails to disturb them.\n\nThe song is a downloadable track on \"Rock Band\" and \"Guitar Hero World Tour\".\n\nThe song \"Stoned\" from the Australian single release features in the 1995 film \"Mallrats\". A re-recorded version of \"Blind\" was in the 1996 movie \"The Cable Guy\" along with its soundtrack.\n\nAustralian band Silverpram released a parody version of \"Tomorrow\", titled \"Frogstamp\", in 1995. The lyrics of the parody were centred around the young age of the Silverchair band members at the time, with the chorus lyrics changed to \"I turn four tomorrow.\" The single peaked at #72 on the Australian ARIA singles chart.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2163006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2163006", "title": "Unlawful assembly", "text": "Unlawful assembly\n\nUnlawful assembly is a legal term to describe a group of people with the mutual intent of deliberate disturbance of the peace. If the group is about to start the act of disturbance, it is termed a rout; if the disturbance is commenced, it is then termed a riot. In Britain, the offence was abolished in 1986.\n\nBy the 19th century, \"unlawful assembly\" was the term used in English law for an assembly of three or more persons with intent to commit a crime by force, or to carry out a common purpose (whether lawful or unlawful), in such a manner or in such circumstances as would in the opinion of firm and rational men endanger the public peace or create fear of immediate danger to the tranquillity of the neighborhood. In the Year Book of the third year of Henry VII's reign assemblies were referred to as not punishable unless \"in terrorem populi domini regis\". It was suggested that legislation first became necessary at a time when it was usual for those landed proprietors who were on bad terms with one another to go to market at the head of bands of armed retainers. An assembly, otherwise lawful, was not made unlawful if those who take part in it know beforehand that there will probably be organized opposition to it, and that it may cause a breach of the peace. All persons may, and must if called upon to do so, assist in dispersing an unlawful assembly. An assembly which was lawful could not be rendered unlawful by proclamation unless the proclamation was one authorized by statute. Meetings for training or drilling, or military movements, were unlawful assemblies unless held under lawful authority from the Crown, the Lord-lieutenant, or two justices of the peace.\n\nAn unlawful assembly which has made a motion towards its common purpose was termed a \"rout\", and if the unlawful assembly should proceed to carry out its purpose, e.g. begin to demolish a particular enclosure, it became a \"riot\". All three offences were misdemeanors in English law, punishable by fine and imprisonment. The offence was abolished by the Public Order Act 1986.\n\nThe common law as to unlawful assembly extended to Ireland, subject to special legislation. The law of Scotland included unlawful assembly under the same head as rioting.\n\nSection 144 is a section of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which prohibits assembly of five or more persons, holding of public meetings, and carrying of firearms and can be invoked for up to two months. It also gives the magistracy the power to issue order absolute at once in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger. With the introduction of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) in 1976, Section 144 has ceased to operate in the metropolitan jurisdiction in Bangladesh.\n\nUnder Part II of the Canadian Criminal Code (Offences Against Public Order), Unlawful Assemblies and Riots is when the assembly of three or more persons who cause fear and on reasonable grounds disturb peace in the neighborhood is against the law.\n\nThe Public Order Ordinance (chapter 245 of the laws of Hong Kong) defines \"unlawful assembly\" (§18) as an assembly of three or more persons conducting themselves in a \"disorderly, intimidating, insulting or provocative manner intended or likely to cause a person reasonably to fear that the persons so assembled will conduct a breach of the peace or will by such conduct provoke other persons to commit a breach of the peace\". Persons taking part in unlawful assemblies can be punished with up to five years' imprisonment (if indicted) or a level 2 fine (HK$5000) and imprisonment for two years (on summary conviction).\n\nSection 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) of 1973 empowers an executive magistrate to prohibit an assembly of more than four persons in an area. According to 141-149 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the maximum punishment for engaging in rioting is rigorous imprisonment for 3 years and/or fine. Every member of an unlawful assembly can be held responsible for a crime committed by the group. Obstructing an officer trying to disperse an unlawful assembly may attract further punishment.\n\nIn about 1861, Officer Raj-Ratna E.F. Deboo IPS was the designer and architect of section 144, which reduced overall crime in that time in the state of Baroda. He was recognized for his initiative and awarded a gold medal by the Maharaja Gaekwad of Baroda for putting Section 144 in place and reducing overall crime.\n\nThe section was used for the first time in 1861 by the British Raj, and thereafter became an important tool to stop all nationalist protests during the Indian independence movement, and its use in independent India remains controversial as little has changed. It is often used to prevent freedom of expression by peaceful protests or demonstrations, even the law does not use the terms, though it does mention \"riot\". Section 144 applies during riots and election proceeding after the declaration of election.\n\n\nSee also: http://law.jrank.org/pages/11014/Unlawful-Assembly.html\n"}

Yakutia is the largest region of Russia. The winter temperatures sometimes reach −60 °C, while the summer is very short, lasting only three months. The holiday is celebrated in the middle of June, at the beginning of summer.\n\nThe Sakha Yhyakh festival (literally meaning \"abundance\") is related to a cult of a solar deity, with a fertility cult. Before the German invasion of the Soviet Union it was held on 22 June, the longest day of the year. Hoever, after 1941, as the date of Yhyakh had coincided with the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, it began to be celebrated in the period between 10 and 25 June.\n\nAncient Sakha celebrated the New Year at the Yhyаkh festival. Its traditions include women and children decorating trees and tethering posts with \"salama\" (nine bunches of horse hair hung on horse-hair ropes). The oldest man, wearing white, opens the holiday. He starts the ritual by sprinkling kymys on the ground, feeding the fire. He prays to the Ai-ii spirits for the well-being of the people who depend on them and asks the spirits to bless all the people gathered.\n\nAfterwards, people sing and dance \"Ohuakhai\" (see below), play national games, eat national dishes, and drink kymys.\n\nDuring years of stagnation, the traditional ceremony was almost forgotten. Nevertheless, the 21st century saw a revival of Sakha culture, including Yhyakh. Until 1990, when the first Yhyakh was held in Yakutsk, traditionally accurate celebrations were only held in a few regions of the republic.\n\nThe Ohuokhai (Оhуохай) dance has its roots in the period when the Sakha people lived further south and were cattle-breeders, termed \"sun worshippers\". It is a native dance that combines three forms of art: dancing, singing and poetry. The Sakha word for \"dance\", \"yungkyu\" (Yңкүү) comes from the verb \"ungk\" (Yң, \"to worship\").\n\nThe Ohuokhai is a simultaneous round dance and song. Dancers form a circle and dance, arm in arm, hand in hand, with the left foot put forward, while making rhythmical, graceful movements with their bodies, legs, feet and arms. A lead singer improvises the lyrics and the other dancers repeat them. This Ohuokhai leader has a special talent not only for singing but also, what is more important, for poetic improvisation. There song leaders compete at the national Yhyakh festival for the best poetic expression, best song and biggest circle.\n\nPoetic improvisation of the Ohuokhai represents one of the richest and oldest genres of Sakha folklore.\n\nThe melody of the Ohuokhai is put to many types of music, from marching tunes to operas. Kylyhakh is the special singing technique of vocal cord vibration. This technique gives a unique national Sakha colouring highly appreciated by experts in \"throat singing\". The Ohuokhai plays an important role in the development of the musical and choreographic arts.\n\nA famous folk singer, poet and composer, Sergey Zverev from the Suntarsky region added many new elements in the expressiveness of the movements.\n\n"}
