{"id": "169515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169515", "title": "1940 Summer Olympics", "text": "1940 Summer Olympics\n\nThe 1940 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XII Olympiad, were originally scheduled to be held from September 21 to October 6, 1940, in Tokyo, Japan. They were rescheduled for Helsinki, Finland, to be held from July 20 to August 4, 1940, but were ultimately cancelled due to the outbreak of World War II. Helsinki eventually hosted the 1952 Summer Olympics and Tokyo the 1964 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe campaign to choose a city for 1940 began in 1932, with Barcelona, Rome, Helsinki, and Tokyo participating. Tokyo city officials suggested a campaign as a means of international diplomacy following Japan's alienation from the League of Nations due to the Mukden Incident, in which Japan occupied Manchuria and created the puppet state of Manchukuo.\n\nWhile both Tokyo officials and International Olympic Committee (IOC) representatives were behind the campaign, the national government, which was ever more interested in military matters, did not have any strong supporters for such a diplomatic gesture. In 1936, Tokyo was chosen in a surprise move, making it the first non-Western city to win an Olympic bid.\n\nDuring the 1930 Far Eastern Games in Tokyo, Indian participants were spotted flying the flag of their independence movement rather than the flag of British India. This caused a complaint from the British Olympic Association. In 1934 Japan attempted to invite European colonies to the Far Eastern Games.\n\nThe main stadium was to be Meiji Jingu Stadium, later used at the 1964 Summer Olympics. The Olympic Village was to be built on the present sites of Kinuta Park or Todoroki Gorge. A schedule was drawn up, and guidelines were printed in four languages. Monthly magazines and posters were printed and distributed internationally. Construction began on some buildings, and arrangements were made with hotels, travel agents, and airlines for easy access.\n\nWhen the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out on July 7, 1937, Kono Ichiro, a member of the Diet (legislature), immediately requested that the Olympics be forfeited. The 1938 Far Eastern Games were also cancelled, but Japan's IOC delegates persisted under a belief that the war would soon be over. Amid the intensification of the war, the feasibility of both the Summer Olympics and the 1940 Winter Olympics grew increasingly questionable to other countries, who suggested a different site be chosen and spoke of the possibility of boycotting the Games were they to proceed in Japan.\n\nIn March 1938, the Japanese provided reassurances to the IOC at the organization's Cairo conference that Tokyo would still be able to serve as the host city. However, many Diet members in Japan had already openly questioned hosting the Olympics in wartime, and the military was unreasonably demanding that the organizers build the venues from wood because they needed metals for the war front. In July, a legislative session was held to decide the matters of the Summer and Winter Olympics and the planned 1940 World's Fair all at once. The World's Fair was only \"postponed\", under a belief that Japan would be able to wrap up the war, but the Olympics could not be moved and was canceled.\n\nKōichi Kido, who would later be instrumental in the surrender of Japan in 1945, announced the forfeiture on July 16, 1938. He closed his speech saying, \"When peace reigns again in the Far East, we can then invite the Games to Tokyo and take that opportunity to prove to the people of the world the true Japanese spirit.\" This would come to pass in 1964.\n\nDespite the cancellation of the 1940 Olympics, the Tokyo organizing committee released its budget for the Games. In a departure from standard practice, the budget included all capital outlays as well as direct organizing costs. The total budget was ¥20.1 million, one-third of which would have been paid by the Tokyo metropolitan government.\n\nThe IOC then awarded the Games to Helsinki, Finland, the city that had been the runner-up in the original bidding process. The Games were then scheduled to be staged from July 20 to August 4, 1940. The Olympic Games were suspended indefinitely following the outbreak of World War II (Winter War in particular) and did not resume until the London Games of 1948.\n\nWith the Olympics cancelled, the major international athletics event of the year turned out to be the annual Finland-Sweden athletics international, held at the new Helsinki Olympic Stadium, exceptionally held as a triple international among Finland, Sweden and Germany.\nGliding was due to be an Olympic sport in the 1940 Games after a demonstration at the Berlin Games in 1936. The sport has not been featured in any Games since, though the glider designed for it, the DFS Olympia Meise, was produced in large numbers after the war.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan hosted the 1940 East Asian Games in Tokyo, with six participating nations. Helsinki eventually held the 1952 Summer Olympics, while Tokyo held the 1964 Summer Olympics and will hold the 2020 Summer Olympics.\n\nDuring August 1940, prisoners of war celebrated a \"special Olympics\" called the \"International Prisoner-of-War Olympic Games\" at Stalag XIII-A in Langwasser, near Nuremberg, Germany. An Olympic flag, 29 by 46 cm in size, was made of a Polish prisoner's shirt and, drawn in crayon, it featured the Olympic rings and banners for Belgium, France, Great Britain, Norway, Poland, and the Netherlands. A feature film, \"Olimpiada '40\", produced by the director Andrzej Kotkowski in 1980 tells the story of these games and of one of the prisoners of war, Teodor Niewiadomski.\n\nHad the 1940 Summer Games been held, a never-before used method of bringing the Olympic Flame from Nazi Germany to Japan was proposed - by air delivery, in the purpose-built Messerschmitt Me 261 \"Adolfine\" long-range aircraft, which was designed to have a maximum range of some 11,024 km (6,850 mi) unrefueled.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34053322", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34053322", "title": "2011–12 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis", "text": "2011–12 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis\n\n2011–2012 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis was a dispute between Sir Michael Somare and Peter O’Neill. Both claimed to be Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea. \n\nO’Neill had been elected by parliament as prime minister on 2 August 2011 and Sir Michael Somare claimed the post on the basis of a Supreme Court ruling on 12 December 2011. Article 142(2) of the Constitution provides that the Prime Minister is appointed \"by the Head of State, acting in accordance with a decision of the Parliament.\" The Queen’s role is executed by the Governor General. The Governor General had therefore to decide on the actual wish of parliament: the opinion identified by O’Neill or the wish as defined by the Supreme Court. \n\nThe situation raised important constitutional issues. The actual crisis cannot be understood as a question of law in the first place. It was part of a longer standing power struggle between opposition and government. O’Neill won that struggle and remained the facto in power after the court ruling. It laid the foundation for his dominance in the PNG political arena. Somare did not admit defeat. The 2012 election, however, gave a clear victory to O’Neill. Somare accepted the outcome and he even supported the election of O’Neill as prime minister. The conflict flared up again during the O’Neill/Dion government period from 2012 to 2017.\n\nThe government of Michael Somare was already challenged before the constitutional crisis. The opposition had tried to mount a motion of no confidence since 2009. This was blocked by the speaker, Geoffrey Nape, through adjourning parliament before the motion could be tabled. Somare’s reputation was also dented by a leadership tribunal in 2009. That tribunal, however, treated him lightly. During the tribunal he appointed Sam Abal as acting Prime Minister. Abal was again acting Prime Minister when Somare was hospitalized in Singapore in March 2011. The position of Prime Minister became particularly opaque when Arthur Somare, a son of Michael Somare and an MP as well, announced in June 2011 on behalf of the family that Somare had spent three weeks in intensive care and could not be expected to resume work as prime minister. Arthur Somare positioned himself in this way for the post. The legality and validity of this statement was challenged immediately as Michael Somare had not been heard himself.\n\nIn this uncertain situation the opposition mounted another motion of no confidence. The success of such a motion was not certain at all. The government of Michael Somare had been established with the support of a large majority in parliament (86 out of 109 votes). Somare had already lost the support of some MPs when the Supreme Court loosened the restrictions on MPs to change sides. A previous attempt to mount a vote of no confidence by breakaway ministers and MPs led by Puka Temu had been unsuccessful. Somare's majority could only be confidently challenged if there was a revolt in his party, the National Alliance (NA). It was also vital that the Speaker would change sides, as he had obstructed previous attempts. When the speaker did so and allowed an open vote for a new government, the parties supporting the Somare government split. NA divided in a breakaway group itself under the leadership of DonPolye (21 MPs), opposed to a group that remained loyal to Sam Abal and Michael Somare (20 MPs). \n\nThe revolt proved successful. Peter O’Neill became the new Prime Minister with the support of 70MPs out of a 109-member parliament. However, O’Neill's People’s National Congress (PNC) had only six seats in parliament. PNC had supported the Somare government since 2007. Belden Namah and Mekere Morauta of the main opposition PNG party led the revolt, but they did not become prime minister. Namah, the leader of the opposition, became deputy Prime Minister. He had also been part of the Somare government. Don Polye, who had led the revolt in NA, became the Minister for Finance and the Treasury. He had been strongly tipped for the post of Prime Minister. It was thus to a large extent a revolt from within. \n\nMekere Morauta on the contrary had been the prime opponent of the Somare government. He did not become involved in the ensuing struggles surrounding the legality of the first O’Neill government. Instead, he used this position to fight a vigorous cleanup campaign of public enterprises in which he attacked especially the heritage of his predecessor, Arthur Somare.\n\nThe government of Somare/Abal was not defeated by a motion of no confidence. In that case the position of O’Neill would have been unequivocally covered by law. It is puzzling that instead, the Speaker had allowed a motion to declare the post of Prime Minister vacant because of illness. That possibility was covered in the Constitution in section 142(5,c) on the grounds: \"that two medical practitioners appointed by the National Authority responsible for the registration or licensing of medical practitioners have jointly reported in accordance with an Act of the Parliament that, in their professional opinions, the Prime Minister is unfit, by reason of physical or mental incapacity, to carry out the duties of his office.\" Parliament had approached the Papua New Guinea Medical Board for such a mission to Singapore at the beginning of Somare’s hospitalization. Nothing came of that. \n\nThe next possibility envisioned concerned the absence of a Member of Parliament, and because the PM is an MP in a Westminster parliamentary system, this is therefore applicable to the Prime Minister. The relevant section 104 (d) of the Constitution reads: \"if he is absent, without leave of the Parliament, during the whole of three consecutive meetings of the Parliament unless Parliament decides to waive this rule upon satisfactory reasons being given\".\n\nSomare had been absent since March but his reasons were accepted by parliament and he was granted leave until May 2012. Parliament then withdrew this leave. However, in early September Somare returned to PNG and declared that he was willing and able to finish his term of prime minister. On 6 September he made a brief appearance in the chamber and therefore the rule of missing three consecutive meetings no longer applied. On 9 December, Parliament amended the law to state that an absence of ninety days would make a parliamentary seat vacant. The Supreme Court would give a judgment on the legality of the O’Neill government on 12 December 2011. \n\nThe Supreme Court came unequivocally down on the side of Somare. There was no legal vacancy in the office of Prime Minister when O’Neill was elected. The Speaker’s decision to declare a vacancy in Somare’s parliamentary seat in East Sepik was similarly unconstitutional and void. Somare should have been reinstated as Prime Minister. \n\nThe factual situation did not change: O’Neill remained in charge. The Supreme Court heard the case again in May 2012 and came again down in favor of O’Neill. The deputy speaker accepted the Supreme court ruling, but declared the seat again immediately vacant on the ground that Somare had been absent for 90 days. He referred to the change in law that parliament had passed on 9 December just before the Supreme Court's decision. O’Neill was therefore again elected as Prime Minister.\n\nThe Supreme Court ignored the change of law of 9 December 2011. It was also not valid on 12 December, as the Speaker of Parliament still had to certify the change of law. This brought to the fore the issue of constitutional law. The Constitution stresses separation of powers. According to those on the side of O’Neill, this implies that the Court cannot exercise executive decision making. The constitutional court can only judge on the constitutionality of a law or general measure. In this case, they were seen to encroach on the power of parliament. The legal battle was a conflict on the sovereignty of parliament.\n\nThe essence of the PNG constitutional crisis in 2011-2012 was thus whether parliament was supreme or whether the separation of powers implied that parliament was under control of the judiciary. This was not in the first place a legal battle, but a political one. It was a struggle for political support. The O’Neill/Namah government obtained that support immediately in August 2011. The PM and cabinet were recognized by the Crown through the Governor-General, Michael Ogio. It also immediately gained international recognition, and the approval of Australia was especially vital. \n\nThere remained some pockets that were loyal to Michael Somare. For example, the court case challenging the legality of the O’Neill/Namah government was opened by the Provincial government of East Sepik, the home base of the Somare family. Nevertheless, the O’Neill/Namah government seemed safe. The judgment of the Supreme Court on 12 December 2011 was therefore a shock. \n\nSomare immediately announced a new cabinet and had his cabinet sworn in by the Governor General. Somare himself did in his opinion not need to be sworn in, as that had happened already when he became PM again in 2007. Parliament protested strongly against this. Ogio was suspended and the speaker of parliament, Jeffrey Nape, became acting Governor General. Nape then swore in O’Neill and his cabinet. Civil society organisations, especially churches, offered to mediate. O’Neill refused on the ground that it is up to parliament to form the government and not forces outside the chamber. \n\nSomare did not come into parliament and was with his cabinet in an Ela Beach hotel. He had the support of about 20 MPs. \n\nOgio was therefore supporting a government that did not have a majority on parliament and his position became thus untenable. He changed his mind and supported the O’Neill government. Parliament ended his suspension.\n\nThe dispute was about the power of parliament, but this does not mean that the conflict was fought with parliamentary procedures. For example, MPs stormed the house of the Governor-General when he supported Somare. It is thus not surprising that control over the police was one of the main issues during the stalemate. Somare immediately appointed Fred Yakasa as police commander. Yakasa controlled the armed response unit of the police. That unit had remained loyal to Somare and had prevented O’Neill from entering the Governor-General’s office (government house). O’Neill relied on his own appointment: Thomas Kulunga. Yakasa turned to the courts and got a restraining order that he was not to be harassed. The threat of arrest was no longer there, but Kulunga disarmed Yakasa’s unit a few days later.\n\nO’Neill had control over parliament, the public service, the police and the army. Nevertheless, Somare did not accept his defeat. At the end of January he walked into parliament showing the court order and demanding a seat. O’Neill replied with a threat of arrest. \n\nThe control over the army was challenged towards the end of January. A retired army officer, Colonel Yaura Sasa, claimed to have been appointed as army commander by Somare. He stormed the main barracks in Port Moresby with a group of soldiers, and took the army commander Frances Agwi hostage. Sasa presented his intervention as an attempt to mediation: he wanted to force both parties to return to parliament and forge a consensus. Vice president Belden Namah, a former ex army officer, announced the arrest of 15 of the 30 soldiers involved as well as the arrest of Sasa.\n\nThe fight to control the judiciary was the most bitter fight of the O’Neill government. It was originally fought on grounds that were not germane to the issue of legitimacy of the O’Neill government. The National Executive Council has no power over the appointment of judges; that is a prerogative of the Legal and Judicial Services Commission. The NEC (Cabinet), however, has the power of appointment over the Chief Justice and it used these powers during the constitutional crisis. \n\nChief Sir Injia Salamo was dismissed in early November on various grounds of personal misbehaviour. The main claim was stealing from the estate of a deceased judge entrusted to the courts. This was one month before the Supreme Court had to rule over the constitutionality of the O’Neill/Nama government. The Supreme Court reacted with a charge of contempt of court for the attorney general Alan Marat and the deputy PM Belden Namah. The police commander followed this up and detained them briefly. The move against Injia Salamo was made under the leadership of the deputy Prime minister, Belden Namah. \n\nO’Neill was at the time out of the country and declared himself not in sympathy, but he assuaged the situation by declaring that under the constitution the Chief Justice could continue to sit on the bench despite disciplinary procedures against him. The NEC withdrew the charges. \n\nThe Supreme Court comprising all five judges met on 12 December 2011 and decided that the seat of PM as well as of MP in East Sepik were not vacant and O’Neill’s position was unlawful. The court came down in the case against O’Neill with a three to two majority. \n\nThe Governor General proceeded to recognise the Somare government while parliament continued to support O’Neill. The court decision was ignored by the O’Neil government and ultimately the Governor General also gave in. The government was not satisfied and pursued the conflict with the Supreme Court further. In February there was another attempt to suspend the Chief Justice on grounds of personal misbehaviour, and a panel of judges was mentioned to look at misconduct by Injia Salomo. This charge was stayed shortly thereafter by the National Court. Despite this, Salomo was forcibly arrested on 6 March and charged. The National Court met on 13 March on the case and permanently stayed the charges, as these were flawed.\n\nThereafter the government tried a new tack to get rid of the Supreme Court judges, and announced a Judicial Conduct Bill that brought disciplining the judiciary effectively under political control instead of under the control of the Judicial Service Commission. Very soon after enacting the law two Supreme Court judges, Injia and Nicholas Kiriwom, were mentioned for disciplinary action to the Governor-General. Kiriwom had organised a protest meeting against the treatment of Injia. This led to widespread protests in the country, such as a massive student protest march. \n\nThe Supreme Court proceeded to hear the case again as to whether O’Neill was the lawful prime minister. The government asked Injia and another justice to recuse themselves from the case because of personal interests in the case. That, similar to the arrest under the Judicial Conduct Bill, would have reduced the votes against O’Neill to a single one.\n\nAt the end of May 2012 the Supreme Court decided and came down again in favour of Somare, this time with three out of five judges while two withheld judgment. Belden Namah, the deputy PM, stormed the court and took Injia Solomon and Nichlas Kirwonto in detention. The government charged them with sedition on the accusation that they had created chaos in the country.\n\nIn the meantime elections were looming and these would be the definite determinant who would rule PNG. That line was strongly taken by the new Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Bob Carr. There were strong forces to postpone the elections. Parliament of PNG even voted for a delay of six months. However, the decision to hold elections was in the hands of the Electoral Commission. There was widespread protest against this proposal. The plan to postpone was shelved. By the time the second Supreme Court decision was taken, parliament was dissolved and electioneering was in full swing.\n\nPeter O’Neill’s party obtained most seats in the 2012 and 2017 elections and therefore he had the right to form a government. A clear majority coalition in parliament elected him as prime minister in both cases. He faced many legal challenges on governance grounds, which he successfully deflected. The only case where the executive was defeated was over the challenge over the Manus Island detention centre, which the courts declared unconstitutional. \n\nHowever, that did not challenge the right of O’Neill to his position. The power structure established during the constitutional crisis of 2011-2012 proved to be enduring: a politician who has the support of a clear majority in parliament can dominate over the whole government apparatus, including the courts.\n\nSomare's National Alliance Party was truncated from 20 to 6 seats in 2012. It was a surprise that he supported the coalition behind O’Neill despite his great enmity with O’Neill before the election. Somare never did really accept his defeat in 2011. He reached an out of court settlement of one million Australian dollars as indemnity for his illegal removal from office in 2011. \n\nIn November 2014 Somare withdrew his support for the ruling coalition. He advocated that Peter O’Neill should face a leadership tribunal because of his handling of the controversial UBS loan to acquire equity in the Oil Search company. In November 2016 he resigned from the National Alliance Party. Almost immediately after that he proclaimed jointly with his old foe Mekere Morauta the need for investigation of O’Neill’s handling of the UBS loan by international and local agencies because of the alleged fraudulent nature of the deal. \n\nSomare decided no longer to stand for office in the 2017 election and retired from politics. His most prominent son Arthur had lost his Sepik seat in 2012 and did not run in 2017. Dulianan Somare Brash, his youngest daughter, contested the West Sepik regional seat that had been secure for Michael Somare in his whole career; she lost. The constitutional crisis led to a decline of the Somare clan that may be final.\n\nThe National Alliance Party (NA) survived the split in 2011. It still gains most of its seats in the highlands, but it became a very different entity. It survived the departure of the Somare family, and in the 2017 elections they were the second largest party. \n\nThe loyalists to Somare succeeded in the expulsion of Don Polye and his friends. Polye founded the True Heritage Empowerment Rural Party (THE). THE party was second in the 2012 elections, with 12 seats. Polye became treasury minister but fell foul of O’Neill. Polye, as minister of the treasury, refused to sign the UBS loan to buy back the OilSearch shares that had ben lost in a previous financial deal. Polye considered it economically disastrous and the procedure unconstitutional: parliament needed to be consulted. Peter O'Neill sacked Polye and appointed himself as minister of the treasury. Polye did therefore not resign but was sacked. In the 2017 elections Polye lost his seat and THE party gained only three seats. \n\nBelden Namah, the deputy prime minister, was relegated to the opposition after 2012. He has since been the accused in several court cases and tribunals. \n\nMekere Morauta resigned from politics in 2012, but came back to challenge O'Neill. He won his seat, but the grand coalition against O’Neill did not come off.\nO’Neill has dominated the political competition since 2011 and the other protagonists in the constitutional crisis have been overshadowed.\n"}

In his monthly column in \"Encore Magazine\", columnist Harvey Shore referred to the festival as \"Australia's first horror film festival [it] recognises the past and gives the horror genre a platform for the future.\" In an article in Sydney's \"Drum Media\" magazine, journalist Liz Guiffre refers to the horror festival as \"a one of a kind in our parts\".\n\nThe festival was founded in 2006, by Dean Bertram, Lisa Mitchell, and Grant Bertram. It was originally a short film festival, but has since expanded to include feature films and horror themed music videos. Indeed, now that the festival runs for a longer duration, the festival's name, \"A Night of Horror\", is actually something of a misnomer (the 2008 festival actually ran for ten days and nights). The principal screening venue for the 2008 festival was the Dendy Newtown Cinema. Additional special events included a horror filmmaking forum, a zombie walk, and a number of horror-themed parties.\n\nIn addition to the principal annual event in Sydney, a \"best of\" program of films from the festival tours within Australia and internationally. Some of these screenings take place at other festivals under the \"A Night of Horror\" banner, and have included programs at: It Came From Lake Michigan Film Festival, Weekend de la Peur, and Revelation Perth International Film Festival.\n\nIn 2007, A Night of Horror International Film Festival also programmed a special selection of Canadian produced horror films for Possible Worlds: Sydney's Canadian Film Festival (which took place at the Chauvel Cinema, Paddington).\n\nThe festival is competitive and films compete for several awards and prizes.

Following the death of Ali's grandson Abu Hashim in 703, the leadership of the Alid cause was vacant, and several candidates vied for it: one party claimed that Abu Hashim had transferred his rights to the Abbasid Muhammad ibn Ali, while another faction wanted to proclaim Abdallah ibn Amr al-Kindi as the next imam. The latter, however, proved unsatisfactory, and Abdallah ibn Mu'awiya was chosen instead.\n\nAbdallah claimed not only the imamate, but maintained that, according to K.V. Zetterstéen, \"both the godhead and the prophetic office were united in him, because the spirit of God had been transferred from the one Imam to the other and had finally come to him\". Consequently, his followers embraced the concept of reincarnation and rejected the resurrection of the dead.\n\nIn October 744, Abdallah and his followers rebelled in Kufa, and joined by other Alid sympathizers (especially Zaydis), took control of the city and expelled its governor. The reaction of the governor of Iraq, Abdallah ibn Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, however, was swift, and he marched on Kufa. Most of the citizens deserted the Alid cause, but the Zaydi contingent fought with enough determination to allow Abdallah to withdraw from Kufa, first to al-Mada'in and thence to Jibal. \n\nDespite his defeat at Kufa, volunteers opposed to the Umayyad regime continued to flock to his banner, including remnants of the Kharijites defeated by Marwan II and some Abbasid followers. Taking advantage of the turmoils of the Third Fitna and the burgeoning Abbasid Revolution in Khurasan, which debilitated the Umayyad government, he managed to extend his control over large parts of Persia, including most of Jibal, Ahwaz, Fars and Kerman. He established his residence first at Isfahan and then at Istakhr. \n\nFinally, Marwan II dispatched an army under Amir ibn Dubara against Abdallah. The Alid's forces were utterly defeated at Marw al-Shadhan in 747, and his rule over Persia collapsed. Abdallah himself managed to flee to Khurasan, where the Abbasid leader Abu Muslim executed him.\n\nSome of his followers refused to believe his death, and believed that he would return as the \"mahdi\", forming the sect known as the \"Janahiyya\". Others, the so-called \"Harithites\", believed that he was reincarnated in the person of Ishaq ibn Zayd ibn al-Harith al-Ansari.\n"}

The incumbent coalition, consisting of the FLN of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and the RND of Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, held on to power after winning a majority of seats. The Islamist parties of the Green Algeria Alliance lost seats.\n\nFollowing events in the Arab Spring, Algeria faced initial large scale protests but have since dwindled.\n\nAn election in 1991 that resulted in a plurality for the Islamic Salvation Front was annulled by the military amid fears of an Islamist takeover causing the Algerian Civil War.\n\nThe Workers' Party (PT) announced its participation on 29 February. Louisa Hanoune has previously clarified that the party had worked with the Socialist Forces Front and would look towards an alliance between the two parties. Louisa Hanoune has become the most popular woman in Algeria after the party came second in the Algerian presidential election, 2009. Hanoune said the party's manifesto would be similar to previous elections, including improved employment opportunities, equal rights for women, the elimination of the Algerian Family Code, making Tamazight the second official language, eliminating laws that condemn people for their religion, sexuality or other discriminatory acts and make Algeria a pioneer in production. She also criticized the creation of new parties that have emerged in January and has asked who funds these new parties.\n\nThe National Rally for Democracy has announced its participation in the election. Ahmed Ouyahia is the party's general secretary and the incumbent prime minister. Ouyahia and Hanoune exchanged strong words in the Algerian media. Hanoune complained about his decision of the military record to the voters, showing that as evidence of possible fraud.\n\nThe Socialist Forces Front (FFS) has announced its participation on 29 February. Hocine Aït Ahmed wrote to the National Council saying that \"participation in these elections is a tactical necessity for the FFS, which falls in line with (its) construction strategy of peaceful democratic alternative to this despotic regime, corrupt and destructive. [The purpose of the party] does not lie in a quota of seats to reach [but] in mobilising political[ly] and peaceful[ly] in our party and our people.\"\nThe party had boycotted the two previous elections because of what it called systematic electoral fraud in favour of the ruling parties.\n\nSo far, the National Liberation Front (FLN) has not made any official publication of who will be their prime ministerial candidate. The FLN is the biggest party in Algeria and includes President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. There are rumours that its candidate representing the FLN will be Khalida Toumi, the incumbent Minister of Culture.\n\nOn 8 March, three Algerian Islamist parties (Movement of Society for Peace, Islamic Renaissance Movement and the Movement for National Reform) formed the Green Algeria Alliance. Its secretary general is Bouguerra Soltani. Sultani said that the purpose of this alliance is to consolidate the voter base of the three political parties.\n\nThe Socialist Forces Front decided to forgo a decision to boycott the election after international monitors were invited to observe the process. However former Prime Minister Sid Ahmed Ghozali urged a boycott on the grounds that the election would be \"a foregone conclusion. Social media was abuzz with many of the country's youth calling for an abstention from voting.\n\nAlgeria allowed foreign electoral monitors for the election. The monitors would include the Carter Center, the National Democratic Institute and other NGOs from the European Union and the Arab League. Overall, there were over 500 international observers. The government also called the election the \"Algerian Spring\" billing it as the freest election in over 20 years.\n\nAlmost 22 million are eligible to vote for 44 parties following legalisation of most parties this year. Voter turnout was expected to be low, possibly less than 35% from the last election. Bouteflika called for a high participation. The turnout was 42.36%.\n\nInterior Minister Daho Ould Kablia announced the result saying that \"the election has reinforced the Algerian people's attachment to the values of peace and stability.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe new parliament's opening session was boycotted by 49 MPs from the Green Algeria Alliance and 11 MPs from two other parties on the grounds that they claimed the election was fraudulent and \"a return to the era of single party rule. \nWe decided to withdraw from the first session of the National Assembly and protest officially against the results of the ballot.\" Lakhdar Benkhelaf of the Islamist Front for Justice and Development, a part of the Political Front for the Safeguard of Democracy, said the boycott was \"a question of principle.\"\n"}

R. Ramanna and produced by B. S. Moorthy. The film's script was written by Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy. The soundtrack was composed by G. Ramanathan and T. R. Papa. The film stars T. M. Soundararajan in the titular role, with M. R. Radha, B. S. Saroja, Sharadha, C. Lakshmi Rajyam and Master Raghunath in supporting roles.\n\nArunagiri (T. M. Soundararajan) was born in the town of Thiruvannamalai in Tami Nadu. Arunagiri was attracted to the pleasures of the flesh and spent his youth in pursuing a life of debauchery. He frequently visited the devadasi Maragatham (C. Lakshmi Rajyam). His sister Aadhi Lakshmi (B. S. Saroja) tries to reform her brother, Arunagiri, so she arranged his marriage with Gnana Valli (Sharadha). Arunagiri was feeling unhappy in his married life. He neglects his wife and continues in his bad ways. He persuades his sister to sell all their property and their house to get money for his dissipation. He reduces himself, his wife and sister to dire poverty. His sister gave him whatever money she earned herself, to make her brother happy. It was said that since he was used to enjoying his life in debauchery, he started to suffer from leprosy and people were avoiding him.\n\nThere came a time when his sister had no money to meet his demands for his depraved life. Arunagiri said he was going to end his life because of this. To prevent Arunagiri from killing himself, his sister says that he should sell her in order to have money for prostitutes. Since he had leprosy, prostitutes could avoid him and if that were the case, Arunagiri's sister says she will offer herself to him, to stop Arunagiri from committing suicide. Hearing this shocks him to the core and changes his outlook. Till that time, he was uncaring about the consequences to his family because of his depraved lifestyle. Arunagiri feels guilty and attempts suicide by jumping off a temple tower, when Lord Murugan himself, disguised as a pious young man saves him, cures his leprosy, shows him a path of religious devotion and initiates him to compose the Thiruppugazh, an anthology of songs dedicated to Lord Murugan.\n\n\n\nThe familiar tale of Arunagirinathar had been made into a film twice in 1937 and was produced for the third time in 1964, after a few decades by the noted director T. R. Ramanna for \"Baba Art Productions\". Sharadha, the multilingual actress played his wife and M. R. Radha and R. S. Manohar played two egotistical persons who face defeat at the hands of the saint. C. Lakshmi Rajyam, a dancer, played the role of the vamp. The brilliant music, particularly the hymn \"Mutthai Tharu\" was much acclaimed.\n\nMusic was composed by G. Ramanathan and T. R. Papa. Lyrics were written by T. K. Krishnasamy. Randor Guy stated in \"The Hindu\": \"The first offering begins with \"Mutthai Tharu\".This hymn with tongue-twisting lyrics in Tamil is difficult to even read at leisure and T. M. Soundararajan created history by recording it in a single take!\". It is composed in raaga \"Shanmugapriya\".\n\nT. M. Soundararajan recalls that the tune was composed by T. R. Papa and before the recording he called on the religious preacher Kirupanandha Variyar, who explained every word of the song and T. M. Soundararajan had rehearsals for an entire day before he recorded it. An amazing performance indeed, not surprisingly the song is one of the immortal melodies of Tamil cinema.\n\n"}

{"id": "17038658", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17038658", "title": "BYU Ballroom Dance Company", "text": "BYU Ballroom Dance Company\n\nThe BYU Ballroom Dance Company originates in the Department of Dance of the College of Fine Arts and Communications at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. It has been a part of BYU for nearly 50 years and competes and performs throughout the world.\n\nFor years BYU offered dance classes that included several genres, but with a specific focus on social dance. BYU's dance company didn't exist until 1953 when Alma Heaton joined the faculty as a recreation professor. Heaton came to BYU having taught social dance for a nationally recognized dance studio, and it seemed logical to continue that instruction at the university level. Heaton's work set the stage for BYU to become a leader in ballroom dance. The Ballroom Dance program has been growing ever since and is now the largest collegiate ballroom dance program in the world. In 1960 Benjamin F. de Hoyos (a BYU professor in the BYU College of Health and Human Performance) founded the Ballroom Dance Company and was the director for 10 years. Following de Hoyos, Roy and June Mavor directed the company from 1970 to 1975 when Emerson Lyman and his wife LeGene took the reins. In 1980 Lee Wakefield and his wife Linda began directing the company. Starting in 2015, Curt and Sharon Holman took the reins as directors of the company and they continue to do so today. \"BYU was the first university to introduce dance into its curriculum; the school's involvement in the sport stretches back for a long time,\" observes Brian McDonald, president of the National Dance Council of America, which governs dance competitions in the United States. \"And now BYU is, without question, the most influential school in the nation in terms of identifying dance as both a sport and a respected curriculum.\"\n\n\nThe BYU Ballroom Dance Company has 160 members and is currently composed of five teams. It is directed by Curt and Sharon Holman. The five teams include: The Touring Company, directed by Curt and Sharon Holman; The Showcase Company, directed by Brent Keck; Ensemble I (intermediate), directed by Marci Edgington; and Ensembles II and III (beginning), directed by staff members. In addition to the team directors, Katie Davidson plays a central role to the program as the Ballroom Dance Department Secretary, managing daily office affairs, student logistics and management at Dancesport competitions.\n\nThe BYU Dance Company currently competes on both the National and International Level. The most recognized competitions that BYU participates in are: The United States National Formation Championships, The World Formation Championships (NDCA), and The British Formation Championships. Though all three competitions are highly competitive, The British Formation Championship is the most prestigious event in the competitive dance arena for individual competitors (though not for formation teams). All three competitions comprise a variety of events in both the International Standard and Latin categories but the BYU Ballroom Dance Company only competes in the team formation events.\n\nThe BYU Ballroom Dance Company has consistently won numerous prestigious awards in the competitive arena. Since 1982, the team has annually won the NDCA title of United States National Formation Dance Champions.\n\nSince 1971, the company has competed at the highly esteemed British Open ballroom competition every three years, most often placing first in both Latin and Standard formation categories.\n\nThe BYU Ballroom Dance Company are the first Americans to win the highly esteemed British Formation Championships, and they have done so ten times.\n\nThe BYU Ballroom Dance Company touring team has been touring since 1971; visiting many countries and cities throughout the world.\n\n\nThe BYU Ballroom Dance Company annually presents Ballroom Dance in Concert and has done so for twenty-seven years. The concerts are currently performed in the Marriott Center at BYU, but prior to 1987 the concerts were performed in the Smith Field House at BYU. The pieces are the creative works of Ballroom Dance Company directors Lee and Linda Wakefield, as well as guest choreographers and professional champion dancers from across the United States and Canada. The concerts first received individual names in 2003; prior concerts were simply titled \"Ballroom Dance in Concert\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5572707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5572707", "title": "Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music", "text": "Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music\n\nThe Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music was a counterculture era music festival held at the Royal Bath and West Showground in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England on 27–29 June 1970. Bands such as Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin performed, and the festival was widely bootlegged. An 'alternative festival' was staged in an adjoining field where the Pink Fairies, Yes, Genesis, and Hawkwind played on the back of a flatbed truck.\nMichael Eavis was attendant at the festival and was inspired to hold later that year the first event of what would become the Glastonbury festival of contemporary performing arts.\n\nThe festival started at midday on the 27th (a Saturday) and finished at about 6:30 am on Monday morning. A DJ played records for early arrivers from the Friday evening and continued to do so between many of the sets until the end. The festival featured a line-up of the top American west coast and British bands of the day, including Santana, The Flock, Led Zeppelin (headlining act), Hot Tuna, Country Joe McDonald, Colosseum, Jefferson Airplane (set aborted), The Byrds (acoustic set), The Moody Blues (unable to play), Dr. John (acoustic set), Frank Zappa & The Mothers of Invention, Canned Heat, It's a Beautiful Day, Steppenwolf, Johnny Winter, John Mayall with Peter Green, Pink Floyd, Pentangle, Fairport Convention, Keef Hartley, the Maynard Ferguson Big Band. This line-up was approaching the level of the more famous Isle of Wight festival held in August of the same year. As it attracted less press coverage at the time and was a smaller affair, it has generally received less attention in the years since.\n\nBath was the brainchild of promoter Freddy Bannister and his wife Wendy Bannister, who had held the smaller Bath Festival of Blues within Bath itself in 1969. The 1970 show attracted a significantly larger crowd of 150,000, but, like the Isle of Wight festival, an audience of such magnitude created some serious on-ground difficulties. The logistics proved to be too vast for Bannister's small team to adequately cope with, and his security staff stole large amounts of gate receipts, resulting in a far smaller profit than expected.\n\nActually getting to the festival itself was another problem for many of the throng of fans. The country lanes leading to the site were swiftly blocked by cars, also meaning that many of the bands' equipment trucks could not get to the site. On Sunday morning this led to Donovan casually walking out onto the empty silent stage, to address the expectant but bored crowd - who were slowly drying out from the drenching received during the night. Being a folk singer, his genre was not what the crowd had gone there to hear. So to test the mood of the crowd out, he engaged in a bit of small talk, where he explained that he had spent the night in his van in a nearby field and so on. Then worked around to asking if they would like him to play a song whilst they waited for the billed act to arrive. A lively rendering of \"I know an old lady who swallowed a fly\" raised the crowd's spirits. Then he played some of his classics. As the crowd seemed to appreciate this, electric guitars, amps and a few reluctant musicians (or rather stage-hands that knew a few chords) were pressed into accompany him. Still no bands came, so Donovan continued. His impromptu and free performance eventually filled in for 2½ hours of what otherwise would have been silence.\n\nAs a consequence of these delays, the festival ran behind schedule and many bands had to play to diminished crowds in the small hours of Monday morning. The last act, Dr John, hit the stage at dawn on Monday.\n\nThe festival featured many innovations, including projections of the bands on screens on the side of the stage, a good quality PA system, on-site tents for the patrons to sleep in and larger tents which projected films such as \"King Kong\" throughout the night. The expenditure on these items ate into the profits, and many people decamped with the tents, which were hired. This was another expense that had to be borne by the promoters.\n\nThe festival was captured on both film and on video, in varying quality, but a lack of post-festival organisation led to the footage being lost for many years. Much of it has now been recovered, but the black-and-white footage is of poor quality and is in many different hands. It is considered unlikely that it will ever see the light of day as a legitimate release since no-one can agree on who owns the copyright. This situation could be contrasted to the Isle of Wight Festival, which was professionally recorded and filmed in colour.\n\nThe festival was widely bootlegged, and several audience tapes are now in circulation. It is rumoured that excellent soundboard tapes also exist, though to this point they have not publicly surfaced.\n\nAn 'alternative festival' was staged in an adjoining field where the Pink Fairies, Yes, Genesis, and Hawkwind played on the back of a flatbed truck. This was a precursor to the many free festivals of the 1970s.\n\nThe festival also suffered from inclement weather on the Sunday night, with Jefferson Airplane being rained off halfway through their set and The Moody Blues not playing at all due to the wet stage.\n\n\nLed Zeppelin accepted an offer from Bannister to headline for a fee of ₤20,000. They took to the stage at about 8:30 pm, as the sun was setting. The performance is considered by critics, and the band, as one of the most important of their career, representing a turning point in the recognition they received in Great Britain (until that point their on-stage success and popularity had largely been borne out on numerous United States concert tours). It was also one of the largest crowds the band performed to; well over 200,000 people were estimated at the time they took the stage. \"Although we were about eight miles away from the stage,\" recalled Saxon's Biff Byford, \"I'll never forget Jimmy Page playing guitar with a bow.\"\n\nLed Zeppelin played for three hours and performed five encores. The setlist was:\n\n\nAt the concert, Pink Floyd premiered their new suite, \"Atom Heart Mother\", which at that time was announced as \"The Amazing Pudding\". The performance featured a complete brass band and 12 strong choir, and took place at 3 am, due to major delays. As well as the Atom Heart Mother suite, the band also played tracks from \"More\", \"A Saucerful of Secrets\" as well as \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\", the B-side from \"Point Me at the Sky\". The band's set list from the show is as follows:\n\nTheir performance also marked the first public appearance of Gilmour's 1969 Fender Stratocaster, which would later become synonymous with both his image and tone.\n\n\n"}

The battle stabilized the Principality of Antioch, which had suffered a disastrous defeat only weeks before. Baldwin II managed to re-take all of the castles conquered by Ilghazi and prevented him from marching on Antioch.\n\nOn June 28, 1119, Ilghazi's Turco-Syrian army destroyed the Antiochene army at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis. After his great victory, the Muslim leader's army captured a number of strongholds in the Latin principality, but more might have been achieved. \"The failure of Il Ghazi to profit from his major victory ... was due not only to his own subsequent and prolonged drunkenness, but to the scattering of his forces in search of plunder.\"\n\nAs soon as he heard the news, King Baldwin brought a force north from his Kingdom of Jerusalem to rescue Antioch. On the way, he picked up a contingent from the County of Tripoli under Count Pons. Baldwin assembled the remnants of Antioch's army and added them to his own soldiers. Then he moved toward Zerdana, 65 kilometers east-southeast of Antioch, which was besieged by Ilghazi. While camped at the Tell Danith watering point, Baldwin found out that Zerdana had fallen. Accordingly, the Crusaders prepared to retreat to the stronghold of Hab, c. 25 kilometers southwest of Zerdana.\n\nOn the morning of August 14, Baldwin carefully arranged the Frankish army for its retreat through open country. Leading the way were three squadrons of 700 knights. Behind them marched the several thousand infantryman, composed of bowmen and spearmen. Count Pons with his Tripolitan knights guarded the right flank. A body of Antiochene knights under Robert Fulcoy protected the left flank. More knights from Antioch guarded the rear. Baldwin led a reserve of mounted knights from Jerusalem, but it is not clear in what part of the formation he marched.\n\nThe Artuqids hoped to provoke the Frankish cavalry into launching a premature charge or to open gaps in the enemy infantry formation. When such a favorable opportunity presented itself, they closed in to fight it out with lance and sword.\n\nAs anticipated, the Artuqid horse archers began harassing the column at dawn. Ilghazi's attacks soon increased in intensity and the Crusader army was probably brought to a halt fairly early in the day. The three vanguard squadrons were dispersed and the main body of Latin infantry came under serious attack. The infantry sturdily defended itself, but, without its normal cavalry support, suffered heavy losses.\n\nOn the left flank, Robert Fulcoy overcame the force opposed to him. But, after pursuing the Artuqids, he rode off with his knights to look into the possibility of retaking his stronghold of Zerdana. Meanwhile, the knights under Count Pons were scattered and some fled as far away as Antioch and Tripoli, spreading the news of a disaster. Count Pons and a handful of knights rallied to join Baldwin's reserve where they continued the contest.\n\nWith adroit use of his reserve knights, Baldwin saved the day. By intervening at each threatened sector, he held his army together during the long and bitter fight. Eventually, the Artuqids admitted defeat and withdrew from the battlefield.\n\nIn Baldwin's narrow tactical victory, the Crusaders suffered serious losses. It may be surmised that the Turkish army also took painful losses, since Ilghazi withdrew his men from the fight, though claimed victory nevertheless. One historian notes that, \"without opposition, Baldwin was able to recapture some of the places lost.\" Strategically, it was a Christian victory which preserved the Principality of Antioch for several generations. The next major engagement in the area was the Battle of Azaz in 1125.\n\n"}

Later on, in 1995 Gorbachev apologised to Azerbaijan by stating: \"The declaration of a state emergency in Baku was the biggest mistake of my political career.\"\n\nIn a resolution of 22 January 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR declared that the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of 19 January, used to impose emergency rule in Baku and military deployment, constituted an act of aggression. Black January is seen as the rebirth of the Azerbaijan Republic.\n\nIn December 1989, Azerbaijanis living in regions bordering Iran ripped down border fences, demanding closer ties with ethnic Azerbaijanis living in Iran. The local authorities in Jalilabad surrendered to rioters, turning over administration to the Popular Front of Azerbaijan. This was followed by a non-violent turnover of the Lankaran administration to the Popular Front two weeks later.\n\nOn 9 January 1990, the Supreme Soviet of the Armenian SSR voted to include Nagorno-Karabakh in its budget and allowed its inhabitants to vote in Armenian elections, thus disregarding Soviet authority and Azerbaijani jurisdiction and causing rage throughout Azerbaijan. This led to demonstrations which demanded the ousting of Azerbaijani communist officials and called for independence from the Soviet Union. Their rhetoric was, according to a Human Rights Watch report, \"heavily anti-Armenian\". On 12 January, the Popular Front organised a national defence committee with branches in factories and offices in Baku to mobilise people for battle with Armenians.\nLocal Azerbaijani authorities were unable to restore order because of internal quarreling and divisions that paralyzed their ability to act. Azerbaijani authorities also ordered the 12,000-strong Interior Ministry troops to abstain from intervening in the Baku riots and numerous Soviet army and fleet units of the Baku garrison and Caspian Flotilla did not intervene to stop the riots, claiming that they had no orders from Moscow authorities. On 13 January, massive anti-Armenian pogroms started which resulted in ninety deaths, while thousands fled or were evacuated by the Soviet military.\n\nOn 15 January, the authorities declared states of emergency in other parts of Azerbaijan (but not in Baku). At the same time, fearing an intervention of the central Soviet authorities, Popular Front activists began a blockade of military barracks. They had already taken \"de facto\" control in a number of Azerbaijani regions.\n\nOn 18 January, the Popular Front ordered supporters to barricade the main access routes into Baku using hundreds of cars, trucks and buses. The next day, Soviet authorities evacuated its representatives and local officials, moving them to military command posts in the outskirts of the city where Soviet Minister of Defence Dmitry Yazov and Interior Minister Vadim Bakatin were positioned.\n\nOn 19 January, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR approved the decree signed by M. Gorbachev, introducing state of emergency in Baku and some other places in the Azerbaijani SSR. The decree stated: \n\n″In connection with dramatic escalation of the situation in the city of Baku, attempts of criminal extremist forces to remove from power by organizing mass unrest legally acting state authorities and in the interests of the protection and security of citizens, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, guided by point 14 of the article 119 of the Constitution of the USSR, decrees: To declare since 20 January 1990 state of emergency in the city of Baku, by extending to its territory the effect of the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR from 15 January 1990.″ \n\nThe decree contravened legal acts in force at the time, which provided that the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the AzSSR would have to turn to the central government with the relevant plea.\n\nLate at night on 19 January 1990, after demolition of the central television station and termination of phone and radio lines by Soviet special forces, 26,000 Soviet troops entered Baku, smashing through the barricades in order to crush the Popular Front. As claimed by Mikhail Gorbachev, gunmen of the Azerbaijani National Front opened fire on the soldiers; however, findings of the Moscow-based non-governmental organisation \"Shield\" found no evidence of \"armed combatants of Azerbaijani Popular Front\", which was used as a motive to crush the civilian population on 20 January.\n\nThe independent \"Shield\" organisation which consists of a group of lawyers and officers in reserve, observed human rights violations in the army and its military operations, concluded that the army waged a war on its civilians and demanded to start a criminal investigation against the Minister of Defence, Dmitry Yazov, who had personally led the operation. The Azerbaijani Interior Ministry officials helped Popular Front activists in stirring disorder by providing them with weapons, technical facilities, and informing them about the movement of army units.\n\nThe troops attacked the protesters, firing into the crowds. The shooting continued for three days. They acted pursuant to a state of emergency, which continued for more than four months afterward, declared by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, signed by President Mikhail Gorbachev. The state of emergency was, however, disclosed to the Azerbaijani public only several hours after the beginning of the offensive, when many citizens already lay dead or wounded in the streets, hospitals and morgues of Baku.\n\nAlmost the whole population of Baku turned out to bury the dead on the third day, 22 January. For another 40 days, the country stayed away from work as a sign of mourning and mass protest.\n\nAccording to one report, 93 Azerbaijanis and 29 Soviet soldiers were killed in the street skirmishes. Other reports state that 21 soldiers were killed and 90 wounded in the fighting. However, how the soldiers died is still disputed. The soldiers' death toll was claimed by Soviet authorities to have resulted from armed resistance, although some of the soldiers could have been victims of friendly fire.\n\nOther estimates indicate that between 133 and 137 civilians died with unofficial number reaching 300. Up to 800 were injured and 5 went missing. An additional 26 people were killed in Neftchala and Lankaran regions of the country.\n\nPresident Gorbachev and other officials asserted that it was necessary to stop pogroms and violence against the Armenian population and to thwart efforts by extremists to overthrow the Azerbaijani government. The government's decree said: \"Extremist groups are organizing mass disorders fanning national enmity. They are committing bold criminal acts, mining roads and bridges, shelling settlements, taking hostages.\" \n\nDefence Minister Yazov also said that nationalists were plotting a coup d'état in Azerbaijan: \"A meeting was planned at which it was proposed to declare the transfer of power into the hands of the People's Front.\" He noted how the \"Popular Front\" declared its own state of emergency in Baku before the action was taken and how Soviet state organs \"ceased to control the situation.\"\n\nDuring the Black January crackdown, Soviet authorities managed to suppress all efforts to disseminate news from Azerbaijan to the local population and the international community. On the eve of the military intervention, one of the leaders of Popular Front, Ekhtibar Mamedov, proposed to Kremlin officials that he appear on Azerbaijani TV at 8 PM to announce that First Secretary of Azerbaijani Communist Party, Abdurrahman Vazirov, would be leaving, and no troops would invade Baku, thus restoring order.\n\nInstead, an energy supply source to Azerbaijani TV and State Radio was blown up by intelligence officers at 7:15 PM in order to cut off the population from any source of information. TV and radio was silent and all print media was banned. But Mirza Khazar and his staff at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty succeeded in broadcasting daily reports from Baku, making it the only source of news to Azerbaijanis within and outside of the country for several days. The Kremlin leadership tried hard to keep the outside world and the population inside Azerbaijan unaware of the intervention, but Mirza Khazar and his staff foiled this attempt. Because of the actions of Mirza Khazar and his staff at Radio Liberty, Azerbaijanis in and outside Azerbaijan, as well as the international community, learnt about the actions of the Soviet Army and were able to organise a protest.\n\nShocked by this \"surprising\" development, the government of the USSR complained officially to the United States about Radio Liberty's coverage of the military's intervention in Azerbaijan. The 20 January 1990 broadcasts turned Mirza Khazar into a legend among Azerbaijanis in and outside Azerbaijan. Malahat Aghajanqizi, a well-known Azerbaijani poet and writer, described Mirza Khazar's appearance on radio at the time of the Soviet military action as follows: \"On January 20, Mirza Khazar with his God-given divine voice, gave hope to the dying Azerbaijani people.\"\n\nA special session of the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR was held on 22 January 1990 at the request of the public and by initiative of a group of MPs. It tried to initially assess the 20 January events and adopted some documents condemning the crackdown operation by Soviet army.\n\nThe Memorial Society and Helsinki Watch reported in May 1991 that they had found compelling evidence that the imposition of the state of emergency had led to an unwarranted breach of civil liberties and that Soviet troops had used unjustified force resulting in many deaths. This includes the usage of armoured vehicles, bayonets and firing on clearly marked ambulances.\n\nThe Human Rights Watch report entitled \"Black January in Azerbaijan\" states: \"Indeed, the violence used by the Soviet Army on the night of January 19–20 was so out of proportion to the resistance offered by Azerbaijanis as to constitute an exercise in collective punishment. Since Soviet officials have stated publicly that the purpose of the intervention of Soviet troops was to prevent the ouster of the Communist-dominated government of the Republic of Azerbaijan by the nationalist-minded, noncommunist opposition, the punishment inflicted on Baku by Soviet soldiers may have been intended as a warning to nationalists, not only in Azerbaijan, but in the other Republics of the Soviet Union.\"\n\n\"The subsequent events in the Baltic Republics – where, in a remarkable parallel to the events in Baku, alleged civil disorder was cited as justification for violent intervention by Soviet troops – further confirms that the Soviet Government has demonstrated that it will deal harshly with nationalist movements\", continues the Human Rights Watch report.\n\nThe \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial of 4 January 1995 claimed that Gorbachev chose to use violence against \"independence-seeking Azerbaijan.\" When a year later the world press criticized Gorbachev for violent massacres of civilians in Lithuania and Latvia, Azerbaijani public was embittered for the silence of the world media on Gorbachev's orders a year earlier, during Black January.\n\nOn 18 October 1991, the Azerbaijan parliament restored the country's independence. On 14 February 1992, the Azerbaijani General Prosecutor's Office instituted a lawsuit targeted at the individuals involved in the massacre. In March 2003, the same lawsuit was targeted at the ex-Soviet president Gorbachev for violating the article 119 of the Soviet Constitution and article 71 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijani SSR. Gorbachev later apologised to Azerbaijan in 1995 by stating: \"The declaration of a state emergency in Baku was the biggest mistake of my political career\". In 1994, the National Assembly of Azerbaijan adopted a full political and legal evaluation of the Black January events. According to the decree of the President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev from 16 December 1999, all victims of the crackdown were awarded an honorary title of the \"Martyr of January 20\" ().\n\n20 January is marked as Martyrs' Day (or literally, \"the Day of the Nationwide Sorrow\") in Azerbaijan.\n\nIn January 2010, a Memorial for the Black January victims was erected in the Yasamal district of Baku. The monument was designed by Javanshir Dadashov and Azad Agayed, and architect Adalat Mammadov. The opening of the monument took place on 20 January 2010. The President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev and the head of the presidential administration Ramiz Mehdiyev, chief executive of Yasamal Ibrahim Mehdiyev and families of the victims of the tragedy attended the ceremony. The total area of the complex is 1,500 km ². The height of the monument and pedestal is 8m.. The memorial depicts a group of people who are determined not to miss armed troops into the city, some of them had already fallen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56890905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56890905", "title": "Brass plate company", "text": "Brass plate company\n\nBrass plate company is a term used to describe a legally constituted company, whose only tangible existence in its jurisdiction of incorporation is the nameplate (the term \"brass plate\" originates as such nameplates are often made of brass) attached to the wall outside its registered office. It can also be used for a brass plate trust. \n\nThe registered office is often the same office and address of the local professional service firm(s) or corporate service provider(s) (CSPs), (i.e. legal, accounting or secretarial etc.) who act as local support to the company. It is not uncommon for CSPs to have hundreds of brass plate companies legally registered at their office.\n\nBrass plate structures are associated with tax havens, corporate tax havens and offshore financial centres.\n\nIn the landmark \"Inspire Art\" ruling, the ECJ defined a brass plate company (in an EU context) as being a \".. company (formed under the laws of a member state) which lacks any real connection with the State of formation ...\". The ECJ ruled that, with certain caveats, brass plate companies were legitimate in the EU. The ECJ previously used the term letterbox company, in the landmark Centros ruling, in relation to companies using various EU incorporation locations (in a brass plate fashion) to avoid unfavorable local regulations in their home EU location, in conducting their business.\n\nWhile legally similar (if not identical), the term letterbox company is usually used if the company legally trades with the general public (as per the Centros case) from its location (i.e. appears as the legal address in a catalogue marketing firm), while all other types are called brass plate companies (i.e. private investment firms).\n\nNeither brass plate companies nor letterbox companies should be confused with shell companies. Shell companies can be incorporated in the full \"home base\" of the main parent company (they don't have to be located in an unconnected foreign location); their key feature is that they have no assets (other than cash, as used in some definitions). A company can be a brass plate shell company (foreign base, no assets), or just a brass plate company (foreign base, lots of assets), or just a shell company (home base, no assets). \n\nIn practice, it is very common for a brass plate companies not to be shell companies; however, many shell companies are often brass plate companies. This is because a very common driver of creating a shell company is often to legally move a business activity to a different location from the \"home base\".\n\nWhile accepted in the EU (from above ECJ rulings), the term brass plate company has become most commonly associated with offshore tax havens (i.e. Cayman Islands, British Virgin Islands etc.) Thus the term brass plate company is often used in the pejorative sense (especially in the media) and associated with undesirable nefarious activities (i.e. tax evasion, money laundering or arms trafficking etc.).\n\nBecause of this, more reputable \"onshore\" financial centres (i.e. Ireland, Luxembourg, Netherlands), who enjoy access to major global tax treaties, generally steer clear of any implication that they are open to brass plate companies for fear of being labelled corporate tax havens, and therefore losing access to the global tax treaty networks.\n\nRegulators in these onshore financial centres control the spread of brass plate companies by enforcing stronger tax residency rules that require greater \"commercial substance\" to occur in the regulator's jurisdiction (also known as the \"central management and control\" test in UK case law). Typical criteria used include:\n\nThere is a level of scepticism over whether such controls are really effective in controlling brass plate companies. CSPs in onshore financial centres are capable of providing local Directors, administration and other services designed to meet the minimum \"central management and control test\" for moderate fees. A recent academic study into Irish Section 110 SPVs found individual CSP officers acting as \"local directors\" for hundreds of SPVs, and found little evidence of any substance to the \"central management and control\" test.\n\nNotable examples of entities accused of using brass plate structures for unsavoury activities include (notice the term \"brass plate\" being used by the media in the attached references):\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2214147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2214147", "title": "Dames at Sea", "text": "Dames at Sea\n\nDames at Sea is a musical with book and lyrics by George Haimsohn and Robin Miller and music by Jim Wise.\n\nThe musical is a parody of large, flashy 1930s Busby Berkeley-style movie musicals in which a chorus girl, newly arrived off the bus from the Midwest to New York City, steps into a role on Broadway and becomes a star. It originally played Off-Off-Broadway in 1966 at the Caffe Cino and then played Off-Broadway, starring newcomer Bernadette Peters, beginning in 1968 for a successful run. The show has enjoyed a London run, a television adaptation and a number of revivals, before its Broadway premiere in October 2015.\n\nThe musical was originally a short sketch, based loosely on the \"Gold Diggers\" movies, written by George Haimsohn, Jim Wise, and Robin Miller. The character of \"Ruby\" was suggested by the Ruby Keeler-type from those early movies. It was lengthened to a 50-minute production, and director Robert Dahdah prepared it for its first staging. After the original actress who was to play \"Ruby\" withdrew during rehearsals, choreographer Don Price recommended newcomer Bernadette Peters for the role. The show opened in May 1966 as \"Dames at Sea, or Golddiggers Afloat\" at the Caffe Cino, a small coffee house/performance space in New York City's Greenwich Village, where it continued for 148 performances. The original Caffe Cino cast featured Peters as Ruby, Joe McGuire as Frank, David Christmas as Dick, Jill Roberts as Joan, Norma Bigtree as Mona and Gary Filsinger as the Director and Captain. Peters was replaced by her sister, Donna Forbes (now DeSeta) during the run.\n\nRetitled simply \"Dames at Sea\", the musical re-opened at the Bouwerie Lane Theatre on December 20, 1968, and transferred to the larger Theater de Lys on April 22, 1969, and closed on May 10, 1970 after a total of 575 performances. Directed and choreographed by Neal Kenyon, the show again featured Peters in the role of Ruby and David Christmas as Dick. The cast also featured Steve Elmore as the Captain, Tamara Long as Mona Kent, Joseph R. Sicari as Lucky, and Sally Stark as Joan. After Peters left the show, the role of \"Ruby\" was played by Loni Ackerman, Bonnie Franklin, Janie Sell, Barbara Sharma, and Pia Zadora.\n\nOn August 27, 1969, the show opened at London's Duchess Theatre, where it ran for 127 performances.\n\nPeters appeared in a regional production at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey in early 1973. In July 1973, Peters appeared again as Ruby at the Academy Playhouse, Lake Forest, Illinois. Subsequent revivals have been staged at the Lamb's Theatre in Manhattan (1985) (with Stephen Flaherty playing the piano), the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, London (1989), and at the theatre where the musical first played off-Broadway, the Bouwerie Lane Theatre, produced by Jean Cocteau Repertory and directed by David Fuller, from September 3, 2004 to November 28, 2004.\n\nThe show began previews on Broadway on September 24, 2015, and officially opened on October 22 at the Helen Hayes Theatre, with direction and choreography by Randy Skinner. A workshop for this production was held in January 2014 with Laura Osnes, Rachel York, Mara Davi, John Bolton, Cary Tedder, and Danny Gardner. The Broadway cast featured John Bolton as The Captain/Hennesey, Mara Davi as Joan, Danny Gardner as Lucky, Eloise Kropp as Ruby, Lesli Margherita as Mona Kent and Cary Tedder as Dick. The show is described as \"a tap-happy gem of a show that celebrates the golden era of movie musicals\". Among the producers are Infinity Theatre Company and Perry Street Theatricals. The show was produced in 2012 by Infinity Theatre Company, Annapolis, Maryland with direction and choreography by Randy Skinner. This production closed on January 3, 2016 after 85 performances and 32 previews.\n\nThe musical is popular for schools and has been produced in many countries.\n\nIn the early 1930s, a Broadway musical is in rehearsal. Mona Kent is its temperamental diva star, Joan a wise-cracking chorus girl, and Hennesy the producer/manager/director. The naive Ruby arrives from Utah, with \"nothing but tap shoes in her suitcase and a prayer in her heart\", determined to be a Broadway star. She promptly faints into the arms of Dick, a sailor and aspiring songwriter (\"It's You\"). Ruby gets a job in the chorus, but Hennesy informs the cast that the theater must be torn down, and they must find another place for the show. Joan and Lucky, another sailor and her former boyfriend, renew their romance (\"Choo-Choo Honeymoon\") while Ruby admits her feelings for Dick (\"The Sailor of My Dreams\"). Dick and Lucky persuade their Captain to volunteer the use of their ship (\"Dames at Sea\"). Mona recognizes the Captain as a former boyfriend (\"The Beguine\"). When Mona kisses Dick, to persuade him to give her one of his songs, Ruby sees and is despondent (\"Raining In My Heart\"). Dick explains the misunderstanding and the couple make up (\"There's Something About You\"). While rehearsing on the actual ship, Mona becomes sea sick (\"The Echo Waltz\"); Ruby steps in to save the show and becomes a star (\"Star Tar\"). The three couples decide to marry (\"Let's Have A Simple Wedding\").\n\nJohn Wilson in \"The New York Times\" pointed out that the music is a mixture of parody, such as the torch song \"That Mister Man\", pastiche (\"Raining in My Heart\"), and the real thing. Wilson wrote that \"The pastiche songs, built around phrases borrowed from or close to actual songs of the genre, usually project an appealing period flavor.\" The joke was that, while spoofing the large, lavish movie musicals, \"Dames at Sea\" did it with a cast of six, 2 pianos and percussion, and a tiny stage.\n\nIn the 2015 Broadway production, director Randy Skinner noted that this was \"...the first time in New York that 'Dames at Sea' will be heard with an orchestra, and the show will have more dancing than ever before with all new dance and vocal arrangements by Rob Berman...' \" This production opened with movie credits projected onto a screen, reproducing exactly the font used by Warner Bros. in the early 1930s. Skinner received a 2016 Tony Award nomination for his choreography.\n\n\n\"*\"</small>In this production, Lucky was called \"Frank.\"\n\nIn his review in \"The New York Times\" of the 1968 production, Clive Barnes wrote \" 'Dames At Sea' is a real winner, a little gem of a musical. The show is wonderfully helped by its cast. The star I suppose is Bernadette Peters as the wholly sweetly silly small-town chorine who taps her way from the bus station to stardom in 24 hours.\" Walter Kerr, in his \"Sunday Times\" feature article, added \"You'll find the show cheerful and ingratiating, I think... Miss Peters is a real find... She is extremely funny, and endearing on top of that.\" The \"Time Magazine\" review noted that the show had \"three thoroughly engaging stars and some of the most ingenious staging currently on or off Broadway. Tamara Long, as the slinky heavy, brandishes a flaming Morganitic torch for her Mister Man, and Sally Stark, as Ruby's peroxided pal, belts a note almost as plangent as the great Merman's. The comic delight of the show, though, is Bernadette Peters, whose Ruby can simultaneously sing and dance up a storm that puts all New York (including Queen Mane of Rumania) at her feet.\"\n\nThe review of the production at the Off-Broadway Bouwerie Lane Theatre (2004) in the \"Gay City News\": Director David Fuller has filled his production with such subtle touches, which make the show seem intriguingly contemporary, and far from the saccharine and serious treatments this chestnut usually receives, he’s restored the true Off-Broadway spirit that used the establishment’s own forms to tweak its foibles. First staged during the Vietnam War era, the musical seems more relevant than ever as it takes precise aim at the sunny outlook that comes from near-psychotic denial of reality. The review praises the cast: \"The cast does a great job... Individually, Kathleen White as Ruby is deliciously comic, with expressions and physical comedies that recall Lucille Ball... Chrysten Peddie as Joan has the tough dame attitude down cold. She’s got a warm presence, is a great dancer and has a strong voice.\"\n\nThe \"USA Today\" reviewer of the 2015 production wrote: \"So why bring this trifle to Broadway, for the first time, 49 years after its downtown premiere? Never mind; just check your cares and pretensions at the door of the Helen Hayes Theatre, ... and prepare to be thoroughly charmed. Through it all, happily, Skinner keeps everyone dancing, providing exuberant tap routines that his cast executes with joyful facility.\"\n\nSteven Suskin, in reviewing for the \"Huffington Post\" wrote: \"The surprise, today, is that the show remains viable; this first Broadway production is impeccably staged and loaded with entertainment, and should delight its target audience ... The songs ... hit all the bases, reminding us of all those wonderful Harry Warren songs; but they are mostly lightweight pastiches, never quite as memorable as the real thing. It should be noted that the show--which was heretofore performed with two pianos and a drummer--is now fully orchestrated.\"\n\nAn adaptation for television starred Ann-Margret as Ruby, Ann Miller as Mona, Anne Meara as Joan, Harvey Evans as Dick, Fred Gwynne as Hennesy and Dick Shawn as the Captain. It was broadcast on the Bell System Family Theater on NBC on November 15, 1971. The cast had extra chorus girls and boys, and there were full production numbers, turning into the very thing it was spoofing. Ann Miller was singled out for praise, especially when \"she was allowed to tap out her brassy...temperamental star...\"\n\nThe original off-Broadway Cast Recording was released in 1969 by Columbia Masterworks Records (Columbia OS 3330) and issued on CD by Sony. The Original London Cast Recording is also available on CD.\n\n"}

The championship was contested each year from 2009 to 2012. It was a revival of the former European Formula Two Championship that was previously run from 1967 to 1984. Organised by MotorSport Vision, drivers competed over 16 rounds at eight venues, in identical cars built by Williams F1, with 400 bhp engines developed by Mountune Racing and supplied by Audi. \n\nFormula Two was revived due to the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile's concern that the cost of competing in motor racing at a level to progress directly to Formula One was becoming unreachable for many participants, and the category was re-introduced as a lower-cost alternative for drivers. The FIA tender to supply and operate the Championship was awarded to the British MotorSportVision Racing company, owned by former Formula One racer Jonathan Palmer.\n\nCompared to rival series such as GP2 and Formula Renault 3.5, Formula Two cost significantly less per season whilst allowing drivers to prove their skill and develop their racecraft, in identical vehicles designed by a six-man team from WilliamsF1, led by Director of Engineering Patrick Head. The F2 vehicles were assembled and prepared between races at MotorSport Vision's Bedford Autodrome facility, prior to each championship event.\n\nIn December 2012, MotorSport Vision announced that the series would not be run in 2013.\n\nNamed after both Jonathan Palmer and Patrick Head, the Williams JPH1 chassis and survival cell is of carbon fibre composite monocoque construction. The car was designed to comply with 2005 FIA F1 Safety Regulations. Head protection conforms to the latest 2009 F1 standards. Amongst many other detailed safety features, roadwheel tethers are incorporated.\n\nThe aerodynamics have been evolved to produce a high level of downforce, yet without losing too much front downforce when following other cars, to facilitate overtaking. To achieve this, about 40% of the downforce is produced from the underside, with full length ground effect tunnels, similar to a GP2 car. The aerodynamics have been developed using the Williams F1 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) computer simulation which enables many different configurations to be tested without the need to actually build the parts and test in the wind tunnel. The car will have over of downforce at – compared with, for example, an F3 car which would generate .\n\nThe internal combustion engine is a new turbocharged petrol engine based on the Audi 1.8-litre 20 valve block and head, as used in Formula Palmer Audi. Whereas the engine in the FPA car primarily uses standard road car components, the Audi F2 engine has been developed as a pure race engine. Prepared and built by Mountune Racing, the crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, valves and camshafts are all-new components designed for high strength and light weight. The dry sump system has been re-designed so the engine sits lower than in the FPA car.\n\nThe turbocharger is an all new Garrett GT35 unit featuring roller bearings for improved response, with an external wastegate with high speed closed loop pneumatic valve boost control for absolutely precise automatic boost control. The engine management system is a Pi Research Pectel electronic engine control unit (ECU), the MQ12, which has more capability than the unit in FPA.\n\nFor its initial 2009 season, continuous maximum engine power was at 8,250 rpm. The F2 car features a \"push to pass/defend\" overboost, with being available for a maximum duration of 6 seconds, available ten times during each race. From 2010, continuous base power was increased to , with an even higher gain from overboost to .\n\nThe transmission is a new unit designed by Hewland specifically for Formula Two, the TMT. It has six forward speeds, and is operated by steering wheel mounted paddle shifters.\n\nThe performance of the F2 car is behind a F1 car, but faster than a F3 car. Its closest rival in terms of lap time is a Formula Renault 3.5.\n\nFor each race meeting there was 90 minutes of free practice, one hour of official qualifying, with the race distance being approximately . This increased to 2 x 40 minute races in 2011.\n\nAll drivers had their cars prepared and entered centrally by MSV. Drivers worked with a single mechanic throughout the season, and a rotating group of engineers. This means that a driver's finances had no effect on performance and no one could gain an unfair advantage as every car was operated by the same team.\n\nFor the 2009 season, the scoring system was 10–8–6–5–4–3–2–1 for the first eight race finisher. In 2010, Formula Two adopted the same scoring system change as in Formula One, with points awarded to the top ten finishers. Points were awarded the same for both races in the weekend, as follows:\nThe races were broadcast by the sports broadcaster Motors TV.

The film combines live footage shot during the 1970 concerts, as well as footage aboard the train itself, interspersed with present-day interviews with tour participants sharing their often humorous recollections of the events.\n\nThe film, released by THINKFilm, was produced by Gavin Poolman (son of the original 1970 film shoot's producer, Willem Poolman) together with John Trapman, and directed by double Grammy Award-winner Bob Smeaton (\"The Beatles Anthology\"), with music produced by Eddie Kramer (Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin), and features original footage shot in 1970 by Academy Award-winning cinematographer Peter Biziou (\"Mississippi Burning\", \"Pink Floyd – The Wall \", \"The Truman Show\"). The original 1970 footage was filmed by director Frank Cvitanovich. A DVD release followed the film's 2003 theatrical run.\n\n\"Festival Express\" was staged in three Canadian cities: Toronto, Winnipeg and Calgary, during the summer of 1970. Rather than flying into each city, the musicians traveled by chartered Canadian National Railways train, in a total of 14 cars (two engines, one diner, five sleepers, two lounge cars, two flat cars, one baggage car, and one staff car). The train journey between cities ultimately became a combination of non-stop jam sessions and partying fueled by alcohol. One highlight of the documentary is a drunken jam session featuring The Band's Rick Danko, the Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia and Bob Weir, New Riders of the Purple Sage's John Dawson, as well as Janis Joplin.\n\nThe event, initially billed as the \"Transcontinental Pop Festival\", was promoted by Eaton-Walker Associates (consisting of Thor Eaton, George Eaton, and Ken Walker) and the concerts were produced and financed together with Industrial and Trade Shows of Canada (ITS) division of MacLean-Hunter Publishing Company (Ken Walker developed and conceived the project from beginning to end) and was to encompass the following cities:\n\nThe Montreal event was cancelled a few weeks before the scheduled date by Lucien Saulnier, chairman of the City of Montreal Executive Committee (and acting under authority of mayor Jean Drapeau), because it clashed with St. Jean-Baptiste Day (June 24) celebrations and there were concerns about a diluted security force and the potential for violence. Buses were run from Montreal to the Toronto Festival Express stop and Montreal tickets were honored in Toronto. The Vancouver venue, Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) Empire Stadium, could not be secured as they were scheduled to have artificial turf (Tartan Turf) installed shortly before the scheduled event, and there was concern about damage to the turf. In March, 1970, Walker requested use of an alternate venue, Capilano Stadium, for the event, but this was denied by the Vancouver City Council over several concerns, including inadequate sanitary and food facilities, challenges with policing the event, and vagrancy. Therefore, Vancouver was dropped from the tour, and Calgary was subsequently added. The event in Calgary was initially to be held in an open field, Paskapoo Ski Hill (to later become Canada Olympic Park), but the city requested it be held at McMahon Stadium instead, as it would permit better organization and security.\n\nThe tour ultimately began in Toronto at the CNE Grandstand, which was plagued with about 2500 protestors who objected to what they viewed as exploitation by price-gouging promoters. The opposition was organized by the May 4th Movement (M4M), the left-rebel group that grew out of the May 4, 1970 Kent State shootings. They attempted to crash the gates and scale the barbed wire fence and clashed with police, resulting in several injuries. To help calm the crowd, Metro Police Inspector Walter Magahay asked the promoter, Ken Walker, to lower ticket prices, but this would have left the promoters unable to pay the musicians. Subsequently, Jerry Garcia, in conjunction with Magahay, was instrumental in calming the unruly crowd by arranging a spontaneous free \"rehearsal\" concert in nearby Coronation Park upon a flatbed truck, while the scheduled show continued at the stadium. Once the free concert, which began at about 7:00pm on June 27, was announced, most of the ticketless fans dispersed to Coronation Park, with an initial attendance of about 6,000, thereby resolving the protest. Once the show at the CNE Grandstand ended at 12:30am, another 6,000 fans went to the park for the remainder of the free concert, which lasted until about 4:00am on June 28. Playing at Coronation Park were The Grateful Dead, Ian & Sylvia and the Great Speckled Bird, James and the Good Brothers, the New Riders of the Purple Sage (all of whom also performed at the CNE concert). Other local Toronto bands also played, including January, The People's Revolutionary Concert Band, Si Potma and P.M. Howard (of \"Beatlemania\" fame). There are some reports indicating a free concert was also performed on the second day, albeit to a much smaller crowd of about 500, as many of the protesters paid admission to the event on the second day. Many people spent the night and following day sleeping in the park until the second show at CNE Grandstand ended at 12:30am on June 29.\n\n(The film shows a liquor stop in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.) On the way to Winnipeg, the second stop on the tour, the train stopped in Chapleau, Ontario, to replenish its dwindling alcohol supply, buying out the entire stock of a small liquor store. The Winnipeg show had only a modest turnout of 4,600, partly due to fears about crowd violence based on the events in Toronto and partly due to the Manitoba Centennial appearance by Prime Minister Trudeau. The event was not plagued with protest or any appreciable violence, however.\n\nIn Calgary, the third and final stop, the police wished to avoid the protests that were witnessed in Toronto and their presence seemed to subdue the crowds outside the stadium, though there were many complaints about the ticket prices. It was estimated that about 1000 people managed to sneak in on Saturday by climbing fences (a few rushed the gates) early in the day, but security was tightened and on Saturday afternoon and Sunday fewer people had sneaked in for free. However, there was a heated altercation between promoter Ken Walker and Calgary mayor Rod Sykes after Sykes strongly suggested to Walker on Sunday afternoon that he open the gates and let the kids in for free after the show was well underway. Walker, who was livid about the mayor's intrusion and his reference to Walker as \"Eastern scum\" \"trying to skim\" the young people of Calgary, claimed to have punched the mayor in the mouth, and boasted that he still had a scar on his hand to prove it.\n\nThe tour had an original budget of about $900,000 (of which $500,000 was for musical talent), but largely due to less than predicted turnout, gross receipts were just over $500,000 and the project ultimately lost between $350,000 and $500,000 for the promoters. Although the tour was a financial failure, the tour featured now-legendary performances by The Band, Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Sha Na Na and Buddy Guy, among others. The Dead were just transforming their sound from dense, jammed psychedelia to the country/folk harmonies of \"Workingman's Dead\" and \"American Beauty\"; the Band's performance showed them at the pinnacle of their powers; for Janis Joplin, it would turn out to be some of her last performances, as she died about three months later. In the film, musician Kenny Gradney, who performed with Delaney & Bonnie, commented on the atmosphere during the tour, \"It was better than Woodstock, as great as Woodstock was.\" Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead further said, \"Woodstock was a treat for the audience, but the train was a treat for the performers.\"\n\n\n\nThese festival performers were not featured in the film or DVD extras:\n\nBecause the Festival Express tour turned out to be a complete financial disaster, the film project was shelved soon afterwards, as the promoters sued the filmmakers, and the footage mysteriously disappeared. Some of the film's reels turned up in the garage of the original producer Willem Poolman, where they had been stored for decades and used at various times as goal posts for ball hockey games played by his son Gavin. The plan to resurrect the film was started in 1999 by executive producer Garth Douglas and story consultant James Cullingham, who found many more reels in the Canadian National Film Archives vault, where it had been kept in pristine condition and unknown to the world. Garth got in touch with Gavin, who had grown up to become a London-based film producer. Gavin produced the film together with his old high school friend John Trapman (who had played in some of those ball hockey games), and Bob Smeaton, double Grammy Award-winning director of \"The Beatles Anthology\" was brought on board. The music tracks were mixed at Toronto's MetalWorks Studios, and produced by Eddie Kramer, Jimi Hendrix's producer, and engineer for Led Zeppelin, \"Woodstock\", and \"Derek & The Dominos Live In Concert\".\n\nThe film was produced by London-based Apollo Films (now owned by Apollo Media) together with PeachTree Films from Amsterdam.\n\n\"Festival Express\" had its world premiere at the 2003 Toronto International Film Festival. Other festival releases included the San Francisco Film Festival, International Film Festival Rotterdam, Bermuda Film Festival, London Film Festival, Miami Film Festival, Wisconsin Film Festival, NatFilm Festival, Karlovy Vary Film Festival, Maine International Film Festival, Flanders International Film Festival, the IN-EDIT Barcelona International Music Documentary Film Festival, Hohaiyan Music Film Festival, Rio Film Festival, Vienna International Film Festival and the São Paulo International Film Festival.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on July 23, 2004 in the United States, as well as in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, and Scandinavia.\n\nA two-disc DVD for Region 1 was released on November 2, 2004 by New Line Home Video.\n\nA Blu-ray disc for Region 1 was released in 2014 by Shout Factory.\n\nThe film earned $1.2 million at the US Box Office, and the DVD went straight in at number 1 on the Music Video & Concert DVD top-sellers charts at Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, Tower Records, etc., and has had an average customer review rating of 4.5 stars out of 5.

{"id": "324889", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324889", "title": "François-Joseph Fétis", "text": "François-Joseph Fétis\n\nFrançois-Joseph Fétis (; 25 March 1784 – 26 March 1871) was a Belgian musicologist, composer, teacher, and one of the most influential music critics of the 19th century. His enormous compilation of biographical data in the \"Biographie universelle des musiciens\" remains an important source of information today.\n\nFétis was born in Mons, Hainaut, eldest son of Antoine-Joseph Fetis and Elisabeth Desprets, daughter of a famous chirurgical doctor. He had 9 brothers and sisters. His father was titular organist of the noble chapter of Saint-Waltrude. His grandfather was an organ manufacturer. He was trained as a musician by his father and played at young age on the Choir organ of Saint Waltrude.\nIn October 1806 he married to Adélaïde-Louise-Catherine Robert, daughter of the French politician Pierre-François-Joseph Robert and Louise de Keralio, friend of Robespierre. They had 2 sons : most famous was Édouard Fétis, (1812-1909), his eldest son who helpen his father with the editions of \"Revue Musicale\" and became member of the Royal Academy. In 1866 his wife died, and he had the request to withdraw from the Brussels society and Court. When his father died Eduard enherited his complete library and collection of music instruments.\n\nHis talent for composition manifested itself at the age of seven, and at nine years old he was an organist at Saint Waltrude, Mons. In 1800 he went to Paris and completed his studies at the Conservatory under such masters as Boïeldieu, Jean-Baptiste Rey and Louis-Barthélémy Pradher.\n\nIn 1806 he undertook the revision of the Roman liturgical chants in the hope of discovering and establishing their original form. In this year he also began his \"Biographie universelle des musiciens\", the most important of his works, which did not appear until 1834.\n\nIn 1821 he was appointed professor at the Paris Conservatory. In 1827 he founded the \"Revue musicale\", the first serious paper in France devoted exclusively to musical matters. Fétis remained in the French capital till 1833, when at the request of Leopold I, he became director of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels and the king's chapelmaster. He also was the founder, and, until his death, the conductor of the celebrated concerts attached to the conservatory of Brussels, and he inaugurated a free series of lectures on musical history and philosophy.\n\nFétis produced a large quantity of original compositions, from the opera and the oratorio to the simple chanson, including several musical hoaxes, the most famous of which is the \"Lute concerto by Valentin Strobel\", premiered with Fernando Sor as soloist. Carcassi, as well as Sor, participated in the performance. The work is attributed NOT to the Alsascian lutenist Valentin Strobel, but to Jean (Johann) Strobach, a member of a prominent Bohemian family of musicians. This Strobach (fl. 1650-1720) served Leopold I, and there is no evidence that Fetis's score is a hoax. The composition was published in 1698, although no copy is known to have survived, except Fetis' manuscript score, which is in the Royal Conservatory Library in Brussels.\n\nIn 1856, he worked closely with Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume in writing a fascinating treatise about Antonio Stradivari (\"Antoine Stradivari, luthier célèbre\"). It includes detailed chapters on the history and development of the violin family, old master Italian violin makers (including the Stradivari and Guarneri families) and an analysis of the bows of François Tourte. His interest in instruments can also be gathered from his very substantial collection, which includes the oldest surviving Arab \"oud\".\n\nFetis had the privilege to have Paganini, Schumann and Berlioz as contemporaries and to work with the violin maker and dealer, Jean Baptiste Vuillaume. Fetis's work provides a unique window into the times and as such is a particularly valuable reference for the modern researcher, dealer and player.\n\nMore important perhaps than his compositions are his writings on music. They are partly historical, such as the \"Curiosités historiques de la musique\" (Paris, 1850), and the \"Histoire générale de la musique\" (Paris, 1869—1876); and partly theoretical, such as the \"Méthode des méthodes de piano\" (Paris, 1840), written in conjunction with Moscheles.\n\nWhile Fétis's critical opinions of contemporary music may seem reactionary, his musicological work was ground-breaking, and unusual for the 19th century in attempting to avoid an ethnocentric and present-centered viewpoint. Unlike many others at the time, he did not see music history as a continuum of increasing excellence, moving towards a goal, but rather as something which was continually \"changing\", neither becoming better nor worse, but continually adapting to new conditions. He believed that all cultures and times created art and music which were appropriate to their times and conditions; and he began a close study of Renaissance music as well as European folk music and music of non-European cultures. Thus Fétis built the foundation for what would later be termed comparative musicology.\n\nFétis died in Brussels. His valuable library was purchased by the Belgian government and presented to the Brussels conservatory. His historical works, despite many inaccuracies, remain of great value for historians.\n\nHis pupils included Luigi Agnesi, Jean-Delphin Alard, Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga, Louise Bertin, William Cusins, Julius Eichberg, Ferdinand Hérold, Frantz Jehin-Prume, Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens, Adolphe Samuel, and Charles-Marie Widor. \n\n\nSome of his criticisms of contemporary composers have become quite famous, as well as the responses that they engendered. He said of Berlioz, \"...what Monsieur Berlioz composes is not part of that art which we distinguish as music, and I am completely certain that he lacks the most basic capability in this art.\" In the \"Revue musicale\" issue of 1 February 1835 he wrote of the \"Symphonie Fantastique\", \"[Berlioz] had no taste for melody and but the feeblest notion of rhythm; that his harmony, composed by piling up tones into heaps that were often monstrous, was nevertheless flat and monotonous.\"\n\nBerlioz, who had proof-read Fétis' editions of the first eight Beethoven symphonies for the publisher Troupenas, commented that \"[Fétis had altered Beethoven's harmonies] with unbelievable complacency. Opposite the E flat which the clarinet sustains over a chord of the sixth (D flat, F, B flat) in the andante of the C minor symphony, Fétis had naively written ‘This E flat must be F. Beethoven could not have possibly made so gross a blunder.' In other words, a man like Beethoven could not possibly fail to be in entire agreement with the harmonic theories of M. Fétis.\" Troupenas did in fact remove Fétis' editorial marks, but Berlioz was still unsatisfied. He went on to criticize Fétis in one of the monologues of \"Lélio, ou le Retour à la vie\", the 1832 sequel to \"Symphonie Fantastique\": \"These young theorists of eighty, living in the midst of a sea of prejudices and persuaded that the world ends with the shores of their island; these old libertines of every age who demand that music caress and amuse them, never admitting that the chaste muse could have a more noble mission; especially these desecrators who dare lay hands on original works, subjecting them to horrible mutilations that they call corrections and perfections, which, they say, require considerable taste. Curses on them! They make a mockery of art! Such are these vulgar birds who populate our public gardens, perching arrogantly on the most beautiful statues, and, when they have soiled the brow of Jupiter, Hercules' arm, or the breast of Jupiter, strut and preen as though they have laid a golden egg.\"\n\nNot one to be outdone, Fétis may have had the last word in this debate. In the 1845 edition of his treatise \"La musique mise à la porte de tout le monde\", he describes the word \"fantastique\" saying that \"this word has even slid into music. ‘Fantastique' music is composed of instrumental effects with no melodic line and incorrect harmony.\"\n\nAlthough known primarily for his contributions to musicology and criticism, Fétis had effects on the realm of music theory as well. In 1841 he put together the first history of harmonic theory, his \"Esquisse de l'histoire de l'harmonie\". Assembled from individual articles that Fétis published in the Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris around 1840, the book predates Hugo Riemann's more well known \"Geschichte der Musiktheorie\" by fifty years. The \"Esquisse\", as the title implies, is a general outline rather than an exhaustive study. Fétis is attempting to show the \"facts, errors, and truths\" of previous theories and theorists, as he interprets them, in order to provide a solid grounding for other scholars and to prevent subsequent interpretive mistakes.\n\nFétis' main theoretical work and the culmination of his conceptual frameworks of tonality and harmony is the \"Traité complet de la théorie et de la pratique de l'harmonie\" of 1844. This book has influenced later theorists and composers including Paul Hindemith, Ernst Kurth, and Franz Liszt. In the \"Musik-Lexicon\" of 1882, Hugo Riemann states that \"to [Fétis'] meditations we are indebted for the modern concept of tonality…he found himself emancipated from the spirit of a particular age, and able to render justice to all the various styles of music.\" Though some other theorists, most notably Matthew Shirlaw, have had decidedly negative views, Riemann's assessment captures the two key features of Fétis' text. Though he did not coin the term \"tonality,\" Fétis developed the concept into its present-day form. He claimed that \"tonalité\" is the primary organizing agent of all melodic and harmonic successions and that the efforts of other theorists to find the fundamental principle of music in \"acoustics, mathematics, aggregations of intervals, or classifications of chords have been futile.\"\n\nThe majority of the \"Traité complet\" is devoted to explaining how \"tonalité\" organizes music. The primary factor of determining tonality is the scale. It sets out the order of the succession of tones in major and minor (the only two \"tonal\" modes which he recognizes), the distances which separate the tones, and the resultant melodic and harmonic tendencies. Tonality is not only a governed and conditioned state, but it is a socially conditioned one. Scales are cultural manifestations, resulting from shared experience and education. Nature provides the elements of tonalité, but human understanding, sensibility, and will determine particular harmonic systems. This concept was called a \"Metaphysical principle\" by Fétis, though Dahlhaus argues that the term is used in this case to denote an anthropological, culturally relative sense in his 1990 book Studies on the Origin of Harmonic Tonality, and theorist Rosalie Schellhous posits that the Kantian term \"transcendental\" might be more appropriate.\n\nHowever, if one wishes to interpret Fétis' metaphysical theory, one of his unique theoretical ideas is laid out in book 3 of the \"Traité complet\", that of harmonic modulation. Fétis argues that tonality has evolved over the course of time through four distinct phases, or \"ordres\":\n\n\nFétis later applied this same system of ordres to rhythm, \"the least advanced part of music...[where] great things remain to be discovered.\" Though he did not publish these theories in any of his treatises, they appear in several articles for the \"Revue musicale\" and in some lectures which had a profound impact on Liszt. Though music had not yet made it past the first phase, Unirhythm, by Fétis' time, he argues that composers may be able to \"mutate\" from one meter to another within the same melodic phrase. Though Liszt may have been an open disciple of the ideas of the Omnitonic and Omnirhythmic, the influence of such thinking can perhaps be seen most clearly in the music of Brahms, where hemiola and mixing of time signatures is a common occurrence.\n\nThe Italian art song, \"Se i miei sospiri\", appeared in a Paris concert organized by Fétis in 1833. Fétis published the piece for voice and strings in 1838 and then again in 1843 for voice and piano with alternate lyrics (\"Pietà, Signore\"). It is these alternate lyrics with which the piece is now typically associated. Fétis attributed the song to Alessandro Stradella and claimed to possess an original manuscript of the work but never produced it for examination. As early as 1866, musicologists were questioning the authenticity of the song, and when Fétis' library was acquired by the Royal Library in Brussels after his death, no such manuscript could be found. Owing to this and the fact that the style of the piece is inconsistent with Stradella's own period, the authorship of the piece is now typically attributed to Fétis himself. The original Italian text for the song (Se i miei sospiri) was found set to different music by Alessandro Scarlatti in his 1693 oratorio \"The Martyrdom of St. Theodosia\".\n\n\n"}

He was educated at Cranbrook School in Kent. Kennard's first wife was Jean Muriel Crossley, they had one son and his second was Audrey, whom he married in November 1940. Kennard married Jane Neville in 1969 and the couple had another son. He died in 1995. Kennard had one son by his first wife, Jeremy, and a further son, Julian by his third wife.\n\nKennard joined the Royal Air Force on a short-service commission in January 1938 as an acting pilot officer. His commission was confirmed in October 1938. During 1938, he bought the prototype Jaguar SS 90 roadster, registered ARW295. He served with No. 66 Squadron RAF and 610 Squadron between until 1940. In early 1940, he flew missions over Dunkirk during the evacuation and, in mid-1940, was engaged in combat missions over southern England. In July 1940, Kennard was promoted to flying officer and assigned to No. 306 Polish Fighter Squadron as a flight commander in the Hawker Hurricane squadron formed by the Polish government at RAF Church Fenton in Yorkshire. The squadron became active towards the end of the Battle of Britain. Kennard sold the SS 90 some time after his marriage in November 1940.\n\nIn 1941, Kennard was promoted to flight lieutenant and assisted in the formation of No. 121 Squadron RAF, a Hurricane squadron composed of American volunteer pilots, based at RAF Kirton in Lindsey in Lincolnshire. The squadron became operational in two months. After converting from Hurricanes to Supermarine Spitfires, Kennard led the American squadron on missions across the English Channel. The station commander at the time purchased a five-gallon tin of peanut butter from Harrods in order to make the American personnel feel more at home. \n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor and the declaration of war by the United States, Kennard is reputed to have proposed a toast with the words \"You're all in it now, Yanks!\" He was made squadron commander in early 1942 and was shot down and wounded in July while participating in a bomber-escort mission. Having flown 58 missions since taking command, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for a combat operation in May 1942 in which he engaged eight enemy aircraft, shooting down two, with a third claimed as probable and a fourth damaged. \n\nLater that month Kennard led his flight in a successful attack on a minesweeper and later still attacked and sank an armed trawler off the Dutch coast. Kennard relinquished command of the squadron in September 1942. In October 1942, Kennard was wounded in action. He was promoted to acting squadron leader in 1943.\n\nAfter relinquishing command of 121 Squadron, Kennard was assigned to the Directorate of Fighter Operations in the Air Ministry and then to a role overseeing troop movements. He returned to operations in May 1945, having been confirmed as a squadron leader, and took command of a Spitfire squadron – No. 74 Squadron RAF. He commanded a station until he left the RAF in 1946 and then served with the Royal Auxiliary Air Force from 1949 to 1952, commanding No. 500 Squadron RAF and flying Gloster Meteors. He was granted the rank of wing commander in April 1949. He took Anthony Eden, the squadron's honorary air commodore, for a ride in a Meteor. \n\nIn 1949, Kennard was to have taken part in a Royal Auxiliary Air Force Race based at RAF Elmdon. He was due to fly a Meteor 3, but the aircraft was unable to participate in the race because of the weather at its base, RAF West Malling. He retired from active service and was appointed to the reserve in 1952 and relinquished his commission in 1959.\n\nAfter he left the Royal Air Force, Kennard became an entrepreneur in civilian aviation. He founded or became director of, several airlines and aviation-related companies, including Air Kruise, which ran Ramsgate Airport, and Silver City Airways. In 1946, Kennard formed Air Kruise at Lympne Airport. In August of that year, Kennard took delivery of the first civilian Miles Messenger, G-AHZS, from Miles Aircraft Ltd. The handover was made at Heston Aerodrome. Air Kruise operated Airspeed Consuls, Auster Autocrats, Miles Messengers, Miles Geminis and Percival Proctors. They also operated de Havilland Dragon Rapides.\n\nKennard and his wife came second in the 1946 Folkestone Trophy Air Race, the first to be held at Lympne after the war. In October 1948, Kennard formed the Kent Coast Flying Club, which was based at Lympne and replaced the Cinque Ports Flying Club, which had folded on 1 October. Amongst the aircraft operated was Miles Magister G-AKJX. In 1953, Air Kruise moved from Lydd to Ramsgate. In 1958, Kennard formed Aircraft Engineering and Maintenance Ltd at Ramsgate. The company overhauled aircraft engine gearboxes, hydraulic systems and instruments. As of 2011, AEM is known as Aviation Engineering & Maintenance Ltd and is a part of Rio Tinto Zinc.\n\nKennard was joint Managing Director of Silver City Airways until his resignation in November 1960. In May 1961, Kennard formed a new airline, which was to be based at Rochester Airport. This airline was Air Ferry. For operational reasons, Manston Airport was chosen as the base. Air Ferry commenced operations on 30 March 1963. \n\nIn November 1964, Kennard formed Invicta International Airlines at Manston, following a takeover of Air Ferry by Air Holdings Ltd. Although based at Manston, the head office was at Ramsgate. On 3 January 1969, Invicta International was merged with British Midland. Invicta became \"British Midland – Invicta Cargo. \n\nThe merger was forced by London merchant bank Minster Trust. In July, the air cargo operation was sold back to Kennard, who formed a new company, Invicta Airways (1969) Ltd. In February 1973, European Ferries Group acquired a 76% holding of Invicta. On 30 September 1975, Invicta ceased operations as a result of European Ferries decision to cease airline operations. \n\nIn February 1976, the assets of Invicta were bought by Universal Air Transport Sales, which Kennard had set up. Invicta was sold in 1980, Kennard left the company and established a business at Canterbury restoring classic cars.\n\n"}

During this period Ibrahim resided in the Hamdanid court in Iraq. In 945, Nuh I dismissed the Muhtajid Abu 'Ali Chaghani from the governorship of Khurasan after hearing complaints of the latter's harsh rule, and sought to replace him with a Turk, the Simjurid Ibrahim ibn Simjur. Abu 'Ali refused to accept his dismissal and rebelled. He then convinced Ibrahim to come from Iraq, which he agreed to do so; Ibrahim first travelled to Tikrit, and then to Hamadan, and then reached the Samanid capital of Bukhara, which he captured with the aid of Abu 'Ali in 947, and crowned himself as the ruler of the Samanids.\n\nThe rebellion of Ibrahim and Abu 'Ali quickly spread around the Samanid state, and even spread as far as Ray in Jibal. Ibrahim's rule was shortly recognized by the Abbasid caliph. However, he was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.

Besides the potential technical hazards on uncontrolled construction sites and in finished buildings, illegal building activity can be a major environmental violation when the works encroach upon preserve areas like nature reserves. Likewise, illegal building can have serious political implications when it is practiced as landgrabbing or for illegal settling in foreign territories (see e.g. International law and Israeli settlements).\n\nIllegal building can be the consequence of a combination of urbanization, overpopulation, homelessness and poverty in which case expanding slums, Shanty towns or similar will result. On the other hand, illegal building activity may be due to profitable speculation with and exploitation of valuable real property. Demand for mass tourism accommodation (hotels, etc.) as well as its counterpart, individualistic luxury retreats for the very rich are visible drivers of such speculation. Similar motivation may come from incentives connected with the illegal construction of great shopping malls or similar on greenfield land.\n\nEven construction works with apparently valid permits can of cause be a result of bribery.\n\nIn some cases it can be observed that legal or tolerated settlements are later declared illegal by governmental institutions in order to make room for more lucrative investments or simply for political demonstration purposes (see e.g. Operation Murambatsvina) sometimes under the pretext of beautification.\n\nAn infamous example of organized illegal construction can be found in the so-called Sack of Palermo.\n\nIncreased landslide risk has been found to be associated with illegal building in hillside regions of densely populated urban areas in Italy and Bosnia and Herzegovina, because of loss of stabilizing vegetation by deforestation, etc.. Due to uncontrolled increase in impervious surface, the role of illegal construction has also been discussed in connection with flash floods (see 2011 European floods#Italy).\n\nIn addition to human observation, large-scale screening for illegal building (activity) can also rely on remote sensing technology using satellite imagery (e.g. from EROS B, IRS-P5...) and geospatial information systems.\n\n\n"}

This applies in many contexts such as workplace bullying, elder abuse, domestic abuse, child abuse, and cults.\n\nIsolation reduces the opportunity of the abused to be rescued or escape from the abuse. It also helps disorientate the abused and makes the abused more dependent on the abuser. The degree of power and control over the abused is contingent upon the degree of his or her physical or emotional isolation. \n\nAn important element of psychological control is the isolation of the victim from the outside world. Isolation includes controlling a person's social activity: who they see, who they talk to, where they go and any other method to limit their access to others.

Januszczak went so far as to tip the collection for the Beck's Futures prize.\n\nThe exhibit was eventually runner up for the prize after Lustfaust were revealed as a fabrication, set within a combination of fictional and actual histories. Shovlin had previously gained notoriety by setting up an exhibition of art that was claimed to have been produced by a 13-year-old missing schoolgirl called Naomi V. Jelish.\n\nThe work has been praised for the depth of its deception — the artists set up fake web sites about the band and added it to English Wikipedia, assembled photographs and chronologies for their tours, recorded an interview with the band's \"German-Belgian frontman\", and even recorded excerpts of music which were attributed to them. The deception was so deep that some viewers actually boasted of having seen the band live. This was in spite of deliberate clues which had been included in the exhibition, such as notes describing the band as veering \"dangerously close to Spinal Tap-isms\" and \"an obscurantist's dream\".\n\nOne person who guessed at the exhibition's nature was \"The Times\" art critic Rachel Campbell-Johnston. Four days before Januszczak's piece was published, she praised the collection, but cautioned \"Don’t be surprised if the entire band is a fabrication — down to its references on internet sites.\"\n\nIn 2007, Lustfaust began to perform live shows across Europe in numerous cities. Featuring a loose and revolving collection of musicians, by 2011 they had performed at a broad range of venues including the Institute of Contemporary Arts London, Museo Madre Napoli, Teatro Eliseo Roma and The Big Chill Festival.\n\n"}

The ICBG had as its aim to document the biodiversity of Chiapas, Mexico and the ethnobotanical knowledge of the indigenous Maya people – to ascertain whether there were possibilities of developing medical products based on any of the plants used by the indigenous groups.\n\nWhile the project had taken many precautions to act ethically in its dealings with the indigenous groups, the project became subject to severe criticisms of the methods used to attain prior informed consent. Among other things critics argued that the project had not devised a strategy for achieving informed consent from the entire community to which they argued the ethnobotanical knowledge belonged, and whom they argued would be affected by its commercialization. The project's directors argued that the knowledge was properly to be considered part of the public domain and therefore open to commercialization, and they argued that they had followed established best practice of ethical conduct in research to the letter. After a public discussion carried out in the media and on internet listervers the project's partners pulled out, and the ICBG was closed down in 2001, two years into its five years of allotted funding.\n\nThe Maya ICBG case was among the first to draw attention to the problems of distinguishing between benign forms of bioprospecting and unethical biopiracy, and to the difficulties of securing community participation and prior informed consent for would-be bioprospectors.\n\nIn 1993 National Institute of Health, National Science Foundation and USAID established the International Cooperative Biodiversity Group (ICBG) program to promote collaborative research on biodiversity between American universities and research institutions in countries that harbor unique genetic resource in the form of biodiversity. The basic aim of the program was to benefit both the host community and the global scientific community by discovering and researching the possibilities for new solutions to human health problems based on previously unexplored genetic resources. It therefore seeks to conserve biodiversity, and to foment, encourage and support sustainable practices of usage of biological resources in the Global South. Projects would be initiated by principal investigators who would apply for a five-year period of funding, and who would establish the terms of the collaboration.\n\nIn 1998 the renowned ethnobotanist Brent Berlin and his wife, Dr. Eloise A. Berlin, founded an International Cooperative Biodiversity Group – the Maya ICGB. The two primary investigators had more than forty years of experience working with the ethnobotany and medicinal knowledge of the Maya peoples of Chiapas.\n\nThe group was intended as a combined bioprospecting and research cooperative between the University of Georgia where the Berlins were employed, the ECOSUR (a University in Chiapas), a small Welsh pharmaceutical company called Molecular Nature ltd., and a newly created NGO called PROMAYA supposed to represent the Indigenous Maya of Chiapas. The two primary investigators had worked for more than 40 years documenting and describing the ethnobotany of the Tzeltal Maya of the region.\n\nThe aim of the project was to collect and document the ethnobotanical knowledge of the Maya people of Chiapas, one of the world's biodiversity hotspots.\n\nThe NGO PROMAYA was established as a foundation that could receive a percentage of the profits from any marketable products resulting from the research, as well as exercise rights over the uses to which the indigenous knowledge would be put. As such, PROMAYA represented the project's will to comply with valid ethical standards and share rights and benefits with the original holders of the medicinal knowledge. Berlin began the NGO by contributing $30,000, money he had personally received as an award for his research. The benefit share agreement on any profits derived from the project allotted the majority to the Welsh pharmaceutical company, about 12–15 percent to the University of Georgia and 2–5% to the PROMAYA NGO. The plan was that Maya communities could then petition for grants from the NGO, to be used for community development.\n\nThe project began with an information campaign directed at the Maya communities with which they wished to cooperate. Using the medium of theater they presented the aims and goals of the project to the Maya. The information step was a vital part of the project's attempt to obtain a prior informed consent from members of the participating communities. The project made the deliberate decision not to include information about the possibility that profits would eventually be made from the knowledge collected, or information how any potential benefits would be divided among them, surmising that the chance of this actually happening was so slim that it would be a better strategy to introduce this issue when and if it were to arise. This decision would later be an important point of criticism by activists claiming that prior informed consent had not been obtained.\n\nSoon after being initiated, the project became the subject of harsh criticisms by indigenous activists and Mexican intellectuals who questioned how knowledge obtained from individual Maya could be patented by researchers or foreign pharmaceutical companies, how the PROMAYA NGO established by the Berlins and under their control could be considered representative of the many different Maya communities in Chiapas, and how it was possible for the knowledge that had been collective property of the Maya peoples to become suddenly privatized without the prior consent of each of the individual initual holders of the knowledge. Among the most vocal opponents of the project were RAFI, a Canadian NGO, and COMPITCH an organization of indigenous healers. Much of the criticism was circulated on listservers and in internet fora.\n\nThe Berlins argued that the establishment of the NGO was the only feasible way of managing benefit sharing with the community and of obtaining prior informed consent, and that since the traditional knowledge was in the public domain among the Maya no individual Maya could expect remuneration. As tensions mounted the Mexican partner UNAM withdrew its support for the project, and later the NIH causing the project to be closed down in 2001 – without having been able to produce any results.\n\nNo one seriously doubted that Berlin and the ICBG had the best intentions of ethical conduct, but nonetheless there remain serious criticisms of the way in which the project was planned and carried out, and the assumptions on which the project was based have been characterized as naïve. The Maya ICBG case was among the first to draw attention to the problems of distinguishing between bioprospecting and biopiracy, and to the difficulties of securing community participation and prior informed consent for bioprospectors.\n\n"}

According to Snopes.com and \"Stars and Stripes\", stress cards can not be used by recruits in boot camp to halt training. But according to \"Time\" magazine, it was issued for this purpose by the Navy for recruits heading to boot camp at RTC Great Lakes. Whether urban legend or not, the purported use of them in boot camp is cited as evidence of the softening of U.S. military forces, degrading readiness to fight and even causing post-traumatic stress disorder in those who are exposed to the psychological rigors of combat.\n\nThe stress cards were said to have appeared during the Clinton administration (1993-2001). Though all branches of the armed services met or exceeded their recruiting goals through this period, recruit quality fell from the peak reached in 1992. \"High quality\" enlisted recruits, defined as having both a high school diploma and an above average Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score were far lower in the 1970s, rising through the 1993 establishment of the first minimum requirement for recruit quality, which was met every year since, in spite of dropping in subsequent years. Possible explanations offered in hindsight were waning public enthusiasm for the military in the years immediately following the successful Gulf War (1990-1991), which coincided with decreasing unemployment and better civilian pay relative to the military; more high school graduates attending college instead of enlisting; and a perceived drop in quality of life and job satisfaction in the military. Even at their lowest point in 2000, these statistical measures of recruit quality remained well above those of the 1970s and early to mid 1980s.\n\n\n"}

The National Hobo Convention is the largest gathering of hobos, rail-riders, and tramps, who gather to celebrate the American traveling worker.\n\nIt's very important to define between hobos, tramps and bums as the hobos are sensitive to the titles. Hobos are workers who travel to find work. Many are skilled craftsmen (women). They are workers. Tramps travel but don't work and Bums are just those who typically don't work and don't travel.\n\nTraditionally there has been a parade on the Saturday at 10:00 a.m., where everyone can let their hobo spirit soar as they participate in the parade. A phrase that describes the parade is, \"Some in rags, some in tags, some in velvet gowns.\"\n\nAccording to the Chamber of Commerce:\n\nFrom a Convention attendee:\n\nBritt's \"Hobo Days\" celebration usually draws about 20,000 tourists over several days, and about 75 or 80 tramps. There is usually a carnival installed on the main drag, with a small Ferris wheel, Tilt-a-Whirl rides and so on. Most of the rides are more suitable for smaller children. There are various food service trucks selling barbecue, pork-chop-on-a-stick, cotton candy and so on. There are often people with sort of \"flea market\" tables, \"farmer's market\" tables selling local produce, etc. Of course, the Hobo Museum is open, and Ms. Castillo's portraits of the Hobo Kings and Queens are on display. During most conventions there is usually live music somewhere downtown in the late afternoon and at night. Saturday morning there is the \"Hobo Days\" parade. It's a lot like a small-town Fourth of July celebration. The parade includes fire trucks, local high school marching bands, ROTC units, antique cars, 4-H Club and FFA clubs on horseback, restored antique tractors and farm equipment and so forth. There is always a trailer float for the hobos to ride. Hobos who participate in the parade bring a supply of individually wrapped hard candy to throw to the children along the parade route.\n\nA signature event every year is the selection of the King and Queen of Hobos. There are rules about who can run and the candidates' qualifications. Men must actually have been a tramp, but there are no qualification rules for the women running for Queen, and no requirement for them to ever have actually been a hobo, although many of the women who have been selected as Queen were actual rail riders with bona fide hoboing experience. The \"election\" is done at the town's gazebo, and is preceded by campaign speeches. A group of vetted hobo judges decides who wins by the applause of the crowd. Inevitably, drama ensues. All this happens as the town is serving up several thousand gallons of mulligan stew.\n\nThere is a difference between the town of Britt's \"Hobo Days\" celebration and the actual convention meeting itself, although visitors are more than welcome to come visit and/or camp in the \"National Hobo Jungle\" next to the railroad tracks. The actual convention is a convention of members of Tourist Union #63, founded in 1899 and still existing today. (There were sixty-three original members.) Much of the convention's activities take place in the Jungle, or in the National Hobo Cemetery (which is in a corner of Britt's Evergreen Cemetery.) There is a day dedicated to cleaning, re-painting and mowing the hobo graves, and a Memorial Service the following day. Generally, shortly after the memorial service, a Hobo Council is convened, and this is an activity limited to actual hobos and members of TU63. You can identify many members of TU63 by a small round patch sewn to a cap or jacket that is a white-bordered black circle with the white numerals \"63\" inside.\n\nThe jungle operates more-or-less on the \"honor system.\" People with the means to do so are asked to contribute an amount similar to what they would pay for a restaurant meal into the \"Frisco Circle\" kitty. Those without funds or with limited funds are welcome to eat for free, but encouraged to help with the kitchen chores. (Half the fun of the convention is being \"part of the crew\" that does the cooking, \"pearl diving\" and cleaning up. Newbies are encouraged to report to the \"Crumb Boss\" for an assignment somewhere on the kitchen crew.) Camping in the Jungle is free. No fireworks, firewater or firearms are permitted within the jungle. (There are several bars and excellent restaurants within easy walking distance.) There are no hotel or motels in Britt.\n\nTent camping or \"tarp camping\" within the Jungle is free.\n\nOther events during Hobo weekend include a Hobo 5K & Hobo 10K Walk/Run, Hobo King & Hobo Queen coronation, Hobo Museum, Hobo Auction, Hobo Memorial Service, Hobo Sunday Outdoor Church Service, Hobo Classic Car Show, Hobo Arts and Crafts Show and various hobo musical entertainment. The Hobo Jungle is open to the public.\n\n"}

Fathers who attend a purity ball make a promise to protect their young daughters' \"purity of mind, body, and soul.\" Proponents of these events contend that they encourage close and deeply affectionate relationships between fathers and daughters, thereby avoiding the premarital sexual activity that allegedly results when young women seek love through relationships with young men. \n\nIn 1998, the first purity ball was organized by Randy and Lisa Wilson in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States of America. This event was created for the Wilsons' five daughters and the fathers that he viewed as not having a place in their daughters' lives.\n\nThe ceremony is a formal event as daughters get dressed up in ball gowns, and the evening typically consists of dinner, a keynote speaker, ballroom dancing and a vow for fathers and daughters. The girls can range in age from their college years to four years old; however, the majority of girls are “just old enough… [to] have begun menstruating” as purity ball guidelines advise. Some ceremonies state a minimum age requirement.\n\nThe ceremonies traditionally begin with a formal dinner, followed by a keynote speech and the ritualized chastity pledges. Although the chastity pledges differ between organisations, the purity balls held by the creator of the concept, Pastor Randy Wilson, follow a symbolic ritual. Each father or mentor pledges to shield and protect his daughter; to live a pure life himself as a man, husband, and father; and, to be a man of integrity and responsibility as he acts as a role model for his family. The father's protecting role over the daughter’s virginity is emphasized throughout the night, as Wilson states “Fathers, our daughters are waiting for us… They are desperately waiting for us in a culture that lures them into the murky waters of exploitation. They need to be rescued by you, their dad.” One widely used pledge for fathers reads: “I, (daughter’s name)’s father, choose before God to cover my daughter as her authority and protection in the area of purity. I will be pure in my own life as a man, husband and father. I will be a man of integrity and accountability as I lead, guide and pray over my daughter and my family as the high priest in my home. This covering will be used by God to influence generations to come.”\n\nRemembrance gifts are given at some ceremonies to represent the girl’s promise of chastity and the father’s oath to protect her and guide her in her lifestyle. One form of token is a charm bracelet or necklace in the shape of a heart for the girl and a key for her father, which symbolizes the father’s duty to protect the young girl’s heart, only giving away the key to her husband on her wedding day. The ceremonies close with a father-daughter waltz which aims to solidify the bond between father and daughter and elucidate the promoters' concept of a \"proper date\". Lisa Wilson, wife to Randy Wilson and co-founder of Generations of Light, a popular Christian ministry in Colorado Springs, states “We wanted to set a standard of dignity and honor for the way the girls should be treated by the men in their lives”.\n\nWilson advises fathers to praise their daughters' physical attractiveness: \"I applaud your courage to look your daughter in the eye and tell her how beautiful she is.\" Participants are described as \"dates\", and, according to \"Glamour\" magazine, could be mistaken for heterosexual romantic partners in the absence of information about their consanguinity.\n\nAdvocates of purity balls assert that they promote physical, psychological, and spiritual integrity. Randy Wilson, one of the co-founders of the purity ball, states that \"The idea was to model what the relationship can be as a daughter grows from a child to an adult. You come in closer, become available to answer whatever questions she has.\" Wilson did not want virginity pledges to become characteristic elements of purity balls as he questions the wisdom of such promises: \"It heaps guilt upon them. If they fail, you've made it worse for them.\" In an interview with Anderson Cooper, Wilson said that purity balls encourage fathers to participate in their daughters' lives, provide guidance, and teach coping skills.\n\nWriter and feminist Eve Ensler criticizes purity balls for implying that fathers, rather than young women themselves, have the freedom to control whether and with whom the young women engage in sexual intercourse. \"Glamour\" claims that National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data supports the conclusion that teenagers making virginity pledges, including those promulgated through purity balls, usually do not adhere to the required standard of chastity, and are less prepared to utilize safe sex practices to mitigate the risks when engaging in sexual activity. Furthermore, Glamour states that the percentage of teenagers in a given area who have made virginity pledges is positively correlated with the frequency with which sexually transmitted infections occur. An article in \"Time\" magazine says that there is a scientific controversy as to the efficacy of the virginity pledges at purity balls.\n\nOpponents of purity balls claim that they encroach upon women’s freedom of choice to date whom they please and to make their own independent decisions without the help of men. In this view, the philosophy of purity balls implies that young girls are not capable of making their own choices. Jennifer Freitag, a Southern Illinois University Carbondale doctoral student, argues that, from a feminist perspective, the purity ball ritual can be considered sexist discrimination as it rarely applies to men, and ignores whether women desire heterosexual marriages. Freitag further asserts that the purity balls and virginity pledges give women fewer opportunities to explore their future mates and presume that the girls will marry men, ignoring lesbianism, bisexuality, and transsexualism. Also, Freitag claims that purity balls have psychological elements of father-daughter incest.\n\nConservative journalist Betsy Hart supports the idea of sexual abstinence prior to marriage. However, she has expressed concerns that purity balls are pervaded by a preoccupation with physical chastity which may inadvertently imbue the social construction of girls attending them with erotic attributes. She claims that this \"sexualizing\" shifts attention away from maintenance of the internal moral and spiritual virtue which she believes is required by the tenets of the Christian faith.\n\n\n"}

The single rule at these events is \"no talking.\"\n\nThe concept is believed to have been created in 2002 by artist Paul Rebhan and musician Tony Noe, two friends who visited several bars in New York City in an attempt to have a conversation, only to find they could not hear each other speak at any bar because of loud music and loud talking. This experience prompted them to invent the concept of 'silent nightclubbing'.\n\nThe first Quiet Party probably occurred in October, 2002 in New York City, and spread to other cities including San Francisco, Washington, Houston, Paris, London, Berlin, Barcelona and Beijing.\n\nQuiet Parties arrived as one of the first of a new wave of unorthodox social activities of the early 2000s that merged elements of traditional party promotion with aspects of performance art. Others in this genre include Smart Mobs, Flash Mobs, and Cuddle Parties.\n\n"}
{"id": "7693616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7693616", "title": "Shandong Problem", "text": "Shandong Problem\n\nThe Shandong Problem () was a dispute over Article 156 of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, which dealt with the concession of the Shandong Peninsula. It was resolved in China's favour in 1922.\n\nDuring the First World War (1914–18), China supported the Allies on condition that the Kiautschou Bay concession on the Shandong peninsula, which had belonged to the German Empire prior to its occupation by Japan in 1914, would be returned to China. In 1915, however, China reluctantly agreed to thirteen of Japan's original Twenty-One Demands which, among other things, acknowledged Japanese control of former German holdings. Britain and France promised Japan it could keep these holdings. In late 1918, China reaffirmed the transfer and accepted payments from Japan. Article 156 of ther Treaty of Versailles officially transferred the concessions in Shandong to the Empire of Japan rather than returning them to the to Chinese administration.\n\nDespite its formal agreement to Japan's terms in 1915 and 1918, China denounced the transfer of German holdings at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, with the strong support of President Woodrow Wilson of the United States. The Chinese ambassador to France, Wellington Koo, stated that China could no more relinquish Shandong, which was the birthplace of Confucius, the greatest Chinese philosopher, than could Christians concede Jerusalem. He demanded the promised return of Shandong, but to no avail. Japan prevailed. Chinese popular outrage over Article 156 led to demonstrations on 4 May 1919 and a cultural movement known as the May Fourth Movement. As a result, Wellington Koo refused to sign the treaty.\n\nChina's refusal to sign the Treaty of Versailles necessitated a separate peace treaty with Germany in 1921. The Shandong dispute was mediated by the United States in 1922 during the Washington Naval Conference. In a victory for China, the Japanese leasehold on Shandong was returned to China in the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan, however, maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33977337", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33977337", "title": "Silvia Odio", "text": "Silvia Odio\n\nSilvia Odio del Torro (born 1937) is the daughter of a Cuban refugee who was jailed for his attempt to assassinate Fidel Castro in 1962. Odio provided testimony to the Warren Commission investigating the assassination of John F. Kennedy that Lee Harvey Oswald was one of three men who visited her Dallas, Texas apartment in September 1963 to solicit money for the anti-Castro cause.\n\nOdio was born in Havana, Cuba in 1937; she remained in Cuba until 1960. She was one of ten children born to Amador and Sarah Odio. Her brother, Cesar, was a city manager of Miami, Florida for eleven years.\n\nOn July 22, 1964, Odio provided testimony to Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the Warren Commission, at the US Post Office Building in Dallas. She stated that in September 1963, three men, whom she described as two Cubans and an American, came to her Dallas apartment and asked her to help them prepare a letter to solicit funds for an anti-Castro organization in which she was involved, the Cuban Revolutionary Junta (JURE). Odio testified that one of the Cubans identified himself by the \"war name\" of \"Leopoldo\" and that the American was introduced to her as \"Leon Oswald\". She said \"Leopoldo\" told her that the American was in the Marine Corps and was an excellent shot. According to Odio, the American said Cubans \"don't have any guts ... because President Kennedy should have been assassinated after the Bay of Pigs, and some Cubans should have done that, because he was the one that was holding the freedom of Cuba actually.\" She said the men told her that they had come from New Orleans and were about to leave on a trip. Odio testified that she was certain that \"Leon Oswald\" was Lee Harvey Oswald and that the meeting occurred prior October 1, likely on the preceding Thursday (September 26) or Friday (September 27).\n\nThe Warren Commission stated in its final report that it examined Oswald's known or alleged contacts and activities in an attempt to determine whether or not he was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy, and that it investigated Odio's statements as part of that examination. The Commission said its investigation showed that Oswald left Dallas for New Orleans on April 24, 1963 and lived there until traveling to Mexico City in late September. It stated he was in New Orleans at least until September 23, the day Ruth Paine took Marina Oswald back to Dallas, and that the timeline of the delivery of an unemployment check he cashed \"firmly established\" his presence in New Orleans on September 25. The Warren Commission said Oswald may have taken a Continental Trailways bus from New Orleans to Houston on the September 25, and that there was \"strong evidence\" in the form of ticket purchase records and eyewitness reports that he took a bus from Houston to Laredo, Texas on September 26. According to the Warren Commission, other evidence established that Oswald had crossed into Mexico on September 26 and out on October 3, the same day he returned to Dallas. The Commission noted a window of time between the morning of September 25 and the early morning of September 26 for which they could not account, but stated that it was not plausible or supported by the evidence that Oswald took a car, bus, or airplane from New Orleans to Dallas to see Odio, then back to Houston where he departed for Laredo in that period of time. It also stated that comments Oswald made to passengers on the bus to Laredo and a telephone call he placed to a resident in Houston indicated that he was not in Dallas on September 25 but was traveling from New Orleans.\n\nThe Warren Commission was \"almost certain\" that Oswald could not have been in Dallas in the time period specified by Odio, however, they requested that the FBI conduct further investigation of her testimony, including the possibility that Oswald may have been with others during his trip to Mexico. In an effort to locate and identify the men Odio said were with Oswald, the FBI interviewed two anti-Castro leaders who denied knowing anything about Odio's allegations. The Commission said that additional investigation, including another interview of Odio, was conducted to find the men who had visited her apartment. It reported that the FBI had located another participant in anti-Castro activities, Loran Eugene Hall, who stated he had visited Odio in September 1964 with Lawrence Howard and William Seymour. Their final report stated: \"While the FBI had not yet completed its investigation into this matter at the time the report went to press, the Commission has concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald was not at Mrs. Odio's apartment in September of 1963.\"\n\nThe United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) stated in its final report published in 1979 that they investigated the possible involvement in the assassination by a number of anti-Castro Cuban groups and individuals. The Committee's report summarized the Warren Commission's findings regarding the \"Odio incident\" and stated that J. Lee Rankin did not receive portions of the FBI's investigation until after the Commission's final report had been published. According to the HSCA, Howard and Seymour denied having met Odio, and Hall later retracted his statement that the three of them met Odio.\n\nOdio was again interviewed by the House Select Committee, as were her family, her psychiatrist, Hall, Howard, Seymour, and the FBI agent who had interviewed Hall. The HSCA reported that it was \"inclined to believe Silvia Odio\" and that at least one of the men looked like Oswald. The Committee stated that it did not agree with the Warren Commission that Oswald could not have been in Dallas during the time period specified in Odio's allegations, and reported the most likely dates for the encounter to be the 25th, 26th, and 27 September. The HSCA stated that Oswald's actions and values were consistent with someone who would favor the Castro regime, and speculated that Oswald may have associated with anti-Castro activists in order to implicate that movement in the assassination or for some unrelated reason. The Committee concluded that \"it was unable to reach firm conclusions as to the meaning or significance of the Odio incident to the President's assassination.\"\n\nAuthor Gerald Posner profiled Odio as an unreliable witness and one who has a histrionic personality disorder. Posner, a defender of the Warren Report, discredited Odio's character by revealing portions of her psychiatric history and accounts of what her friends told him. Specifically, Posner mentioned Odio's hysterical fainting spells and that she is a divorcee who left a fractious marriage. Odio's psychiatrist, Dr. Burton Einspruch, told the House Select Committee \"Let me say, consciously, I don’t think she would want to lie, but to me, it’s very conceivable that in the histrionic personality, the kind of personality that she had that where she would not lie, she could be — has a degree of suggestibility that she could believe something that did not really transpire.\"\n"}

It can be considered the online equivalent of a traditional tradeshow or exhibition, but exhibitors and visitors connect with one another via the Internet, regardless of geographic location, to exchange valuable information.\n\nThe \"virtual tradeshow\" was first publicly described and presented as \"ConventionView\" by Alan Saperstein and Randy Selman of Visual Data Corporation now known as Onstream Media in April 1993 in a presentation to investors at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York city. The company was videotaping trade show exhibitors booths and then attaching the videos to HTML floor maps. Although Conventionview met with some early success, the company closed it down returning to the market with a multimedia virtual tradeshow platform called MarketPlace365 in November 2010. Vtradefair.com in India has organised 14 tradefairs and has been successful in getting filtered leads to their exhibitors.\n\nThe structure of a typical virtual tradeshow often includes a virtual exhibition hall which users enter with specific permissions and capabilities. Exhibitors can build virtual stands or booths to exhibit information related to their products or services, just as they would at a trade fair in a convention center; visitors view these virtual trade show displays in the exhibition hall. Users - both exhibitors and visitors - within the environment often create avatars as a visual representation of themselves.\n\nLike their physical counterparts, virtual tradeshows may have other components such as a web conference, a web seminar ('webinar'), or other educational presentations. The virtual trade fair thus provides live interaction between users on several levels (one-to-one, one-to-few, one-to-many and many-to-many) and simultaneously. Detailed tracking mechanisms allow organisers to determine the flow of traffic in the virtual tradeshow. Although virtual tradeshows are usually conducted in specialised web environments, some have been organised and conducted in tightly controlled text based environments.\n\nVirtual tradeshows can be used for international tradeshows, business match-makers, procurement fairs, or product launches. The experience also translates well for other applications such as virtual job fairs, virtual benefits fairs, online employee networks, distributor fairs, and venture capital fairs.\n\nProviders of virtual event platforms have seen immense growth in the demand for their products partly attributable to the 2009-2010 recession driving cost-cutting approaches to business. According to a Champion Exposition Services study, one in four people planned to use a digital event platform in the association market. The study also found that 70% of \"respondents are actively producing, considering or interested in pursuing virtual events.\" However, many were not looking to replace physical events, but add on virtual components.\n\nVisitors to a virtual tradeshow usually fill out an online registration form to create an online badge, and then enter a virtual exhibit hall to visit virtual booths. The virtual booths often reflect the imagery of a real-world tradeshow booth with desks and displays (this similarity helps users relate to them more easily). A virtual booth typically has several icons which can trigger different responses upon the click of the mouse. For example, visitors might initiate instant communication with the exhibitor via an instant message, email or a voice-call. Icons might also deliver multimedia such as videos and audio messages or other slide-show presentations.\n\nVirtual exhibitors use online tools to upload relevant and tailored content to appeal to the audiences. Virtual exhibits may be made to look like an exhibitor's real-world booth in any in-person trade fair where they may be exhibiting.\n\nWhile some events are online-only, virtual tradeshows could also be run in conjunction with real-world or in-person tradeshows, creating 'hybrid events'.\n\nVirtual tradeshows typically cost much less than traditional trade shows. Since virtual trade shows can be conducted from a person's desk, the cost of travel, lodging and physical construction of a trade show display is eliminated (exhibitors will usually, of course, be charged for the privilege of having an online stand at the virtual tradeshow).\n\n"}

(Korean: YG 엔터테인먼트) is a South Korean entertainment company established in 1996 by Yang Hyun-suk. The company operates as a record label, talent agency, music production company, event management and concert production company, and music publishing house. In addition, the company operates a number of subsidiary ventures under a separate public traded company - YG PLUS, which includes a clothing line, a golf management agency, and a cosmetics brand. It is currently one of the largest entertainment companies in South Korea.\n\nFormerly home to artists like Wheesung, Epik High, 1TYM, Gummy, Seven, Minzy, Park Bom, 2NE1, Nam Tae-hyun, Lee Jong-suk, and Psy, its current roster of artists includes Big Bang, CL, Dara, Akdong Musician, Lee Hi, Winner, iKon, Sechskies, Jinusean, Black Pink and One as well as actors and actresses including Kang Dong-won, Choi Ji-woo, Cha Seung-won, Lee Sung-kyung, Nam Joo-hyuk and Yoo In-na.\n\nIn March 1996, Yang Hyun-suk, a former member of the first-generation K-pop group Seo Taiji and Boys, founded YG Entertainment along with his younger brother Yang Min-suk. The company's first artist was the hip-hop trio Keep Six. When they failed to attract popularity, Yang turned his focus to the duo Jinusean and in 1998 to the debut of 1TYM. Both were successful artists that Yang credits for bringing YG Entertainment, and the hip hop genre, into the Korean music mainstream.\n\nIn 1999, YG Entertainment's artists released a collaborative album under the name YG Family. The label followed with releases from artists such as Perry, Swi.T, Big Mama, Lexy, Gummy and Wheesung. It also established the \"YG Underground\" label, which housed 45RPM and Stony Skunk. In 2001, a second YG Family album was released. Among others, it featured the 13-year-old G-Dragon, who was then a trainee.\n\nThe agency found success in both Korea and Japan with its first \"idol\" singer Se7en in 2003, who became the company's first artist to attempt to cross over into the US music scene, though his US debut failed to gain momentum.\n\nFollowing Se7en's success, YG Entertainment formed its first idol group Big Bang in 2006. Despite an initial lukewarm reception, the group's breakthrough the following year and their consistent popularity have made them one of the biggest and most bankable boy bands in the world. This was followed by YG's first successful girl group 2NE1 in 2009, who, prior to their split in 2016, were considered one of the most successful and popular girl groups in South Korea. Similarly to Seven, both groups conducted successful careers in Japan.\n\nIn 2010, YG Entertainment made a highly publicized move into a new building, while the old headquarters became a training facility. In the same year, the company unsuccessfully applied for listing on the stock exchange; it was suspected that this was because the company had too few active music groups and an unstable cash flow, despite an increase in earnings in 2009. Later that year, the label signed established artist Psy.\n\n2012 brought YG international recognition when Psy's \"Gangnam Style\" gained worldwide popularity as a viral video. On August 21, it charted at number one on the iTunes Music Video Charts. This feat was a first for a South Korean artist. By November 24, \"Gangnam Style\" had become the most viewed video in YouTube history, and the first video to surpass a billion views. The song was credited as the main reason for YG Entertainment's share prices increasing by more than 60 per cent, with the record label subsequently filing its first annual report in 2012 with profits of over 50% after going public on the KOSDAQ the year before.\n\nThat same year, the label signed rapper and producer Tablo, leader of the hip hop group Epik High, relaunching his career after . Tablo’s band Epik High later transitioned into the record label following his success.\n\nYang’s increased involvement on competitive reality television series led to several record deals with contestants, starting with \"K-pop Star\"’s first season runner-up Lee Hi. Other participants on the show were signed as potential members of the label's future boy groups. On the second season of the show, both the winners, sibling duo Akdong Musician as well as runner-up Bang Ye-dam, signed under the agency. Additionally, the reality program \"WIN: Who is Next\" was later launched by YG Entertainment, in which two teams of male trainees competed against each other for the chance to sign a contract with the label to debut as the company's next boy band. The conclusion of the reality series saw the formation of Winner.\n\nIn 2014, YG Entertainment acquired T Entertainment's staff and actors including Cha Seung-won, Im Ye-jin, and Jang Hyun-sung. Additionally, through the acquisition of modelling agency K-Plus, it expanded its acting division through the acting debuts of models Lee Sung-kyung and Nam Joo-hyuk. YG also signed a contract with actress Choi Ji-woo. French luxury giant LVMH's private equity arm, L Capital Asia, later announced that it would be investing up to US$80 million in YG Entertainment. Headquartered in Singapore, L Capital Asia would become the second-largest investor in YG with an 11.5% stake, second only to Yang Hyun-suk's 28%. In 2014 YG Entertainment also expanded into the beauty industry with the creation of its cosmetics brand Moonshot.\n\nIn 2015, YG Entertainment invested nearly US$100 million in a new Gyeonggi-do-based industrial complex which was slated to be complete by December 2018. Real estate in Seoul worth ₩16 billion (US$14 million) was also purchased for the purpose of expanding their headquarters. In that year, the company also saw the creation of two sub-labels, the first led by Tablo and the second headed by YG producers Teddy Park of 1TYM and Kush of Stony Skunk. Additionally, the members of the losing team from the reality series \"WIN: Who is Next\" regrouped and debuted as iKON, along with a new member.\n\nSixteen years after the group's disbandment, first-generation K-pop boy band Sechs Kies signed a contract with YG in May 2016 to relaunch their career. In the same month, Chinese technology enterprises Tencent and Weiying Technology announced an investment of in YG. Weiying took a 8.2% stake in the company and Tencent a 4.5% stake. YG later added Lee Jong-suk, Kang Dong-won, and Kim Hee-jung to their list of actors.\n\nYG Entertainment debuted the four-member Black Pink in 2016, followed by the solo rapper One the following year. Later that year, YG launched a talent show titled \"Mix Nine\", a contest between trainees from different agencies. Although the winning team was scheduled to debut as idols, YG revealed that the debut for the male winning group had been cancelled. The failure of the show led to incurred losses of ₩7 billion won in the first quarter and ₩4 billion won in the last three months of 2017, causing JYP Entertainment to surpass YG as the second-highest valued K-pop company. \n\nOn May 15 2018, it was announced that PSY would be leaving the company after 8 years.\n\nYG Entertainment's records are distributed by the following:\n\nIn March 2010, seven record labels in Korea (including the three biggest agencies: YG Entertainment, S.M. Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, Star Empire Entertainment, Medialine, CAN Entertainment, and Music Factory) jointly established KMP Holdings, a service platform aiming to provide digital music distribution and television program productions. It was speculated that this was in challenge to the duopoly on music distribution in Korea by Mnet Media and LOEN Entertainment. In November 2012, KMP Holdings was acquired by KT Music. In January 2014, the seven agencies behind KMP Holdings formed a collective bond partnership and purchased 13.48% of KT Music's stocks, leaving parent company KT Corporation with 49.99%.\n\nYGEX was established on April 12, 2011, as a partnership between AVEX and YG Entertainment for the promotion and release of all YG Entertainment's material in Japan.
