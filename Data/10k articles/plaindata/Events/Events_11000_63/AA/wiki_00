The fire killed six children and one adult, and destroyed the amusement park's ghost train. Inadequate fire-fighting measures and low staffing caused the fire to completely destroy the ride, which was first constructed in 1931, and had been transported from Glenelg, South Australia to Milsons Point, New South Wales during 1934 and 1935.\n\nOriginally the fire was blamed on electrical faults, but arson by unknown figures has also been claimed. The exact cause of the fire could not be determined by a coronial inquiry. The coroner also ruled that, while the actions of Luna Park's management and staff before and during the fire (in particular their choosing not to follow advice on the installation of a sprinkler system in the ride) breached their duty of care, charges of criminal negligence should not be laid. The case was reopened in 1987: no new findings were made, although the police investigation and coronial inquiry were criticised. The fire forced the closure of Luna Park until 1982, when it reopened under a new name and new owners.\n\nA memorial garden was installed by Luna Park in 1995, but its fixtures were lost during the park's 2003 redevelopment. In replacement, a plaque listing those killed was placed on the location of the ride, but a promised mural to surround the plaque was never painted. A separate memorial park was created by North Sydney Council in 2007, including a sculpture by Michael Leunig.\n\nLuna Park's Ghost Train was a ghost train-style amusement ride. Designed and constructed in 1931 at Luna Park Glenelg, the ride was transported to Milsons Point along with all the other rides and reassembled prior to Luna Park Sydney's first opening in October 1935.\n\nOn the night of 9 June 1979, a fire broke out inside the ride at approximately 10:15 pm. Due to a combination of low water pressure, under-staffing within the park, and inadequate coverage of the Ghost Train by the park's fire hose system, the fire was able to completely consume the ride. It took an hour to bring the fire under control, but it was extinguished before any significant damage could be done to the adjacent River Caves and Big Dipper.\n\nAround 35 people were believed to have been on the ride when thick smoke began to escape from the tunnel doors. Ride staff raised the alarm, and began to pull people from the ride as their cars exited the tunnel. It was initially thought that everybody had escaped the fire, but at around 11:30 pm, the bodies of seven people were found inside the ride: John Godson and his two children, Damien and Craig, and four Waverley College students; Jonathon Billings, Richard Carroll, Michael Johnson, and Seamus Rahilly. At the time of the fire, investigating police speculated that the seven had climbed out of their cars and unsuccessfully tried to find their way out of the tunnel; had they stayed in the cars, they might have survived. Other evacuated passengers reported seeing empty cars exit the tunnel on fire.\n\nThe park was shut down immediately after the incident for a federal investigation. A coronial inquiry into the incident did not determine the cause of the fire, although it was demonstrated that the ride's permanent wiring and attractions were not the source of ignition. Coroner Kevin Anderson found that Luna Park's management had failed to develop an adequate fire suppression program, despite recommendations by North Sydney Council and the Fire Department eighteen months earlier. Anderson's report stated that while the park's owners and management had failed in their duty of care towards patrons, the failure was not \"that high degree of negligence necessary to support a charge of criminal negligence\". The NSW Government called for new tenders to operate the park on 31 July 1979.\n\nBefore the fire, a Sydney design consultant stated that he had advised Luna Park management to install a sprinkler system in the Ghost Train in December 1977, following an inspection of the park for potential renovations. The recommendation was not followed.\n\nIn 1987, a Government inquiry into corruption by the National Crime Authority reopened the investigation of the fire. No new evidence was presented, but it was found that the police investigation into the incident had been inadequate, and the coronial inquiry ineffective.\n\nDespite claims ranging from faulty wiring to sabotage in an attempt to have the park closed down and demolished, the cause of the fire has never been established.\n\nIn May 2007, Anne Buckingham, a niece of Sydney underworld figure Abe Saffron, claimed in an interview with \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" that her uncle was responsible for the fire. Saffron had been associated with seven other arson attacks in the two years following the Ghost Train fire, although he had repeatedly denied involvement with the Ghost Train fire. Buckingham claimed the attack was part of a plan for Saffron to gain control of Luna Park's lease, although she stated her belief that the seven deaths were not intended.\n\nFormer Park Artist Martin Sharp claimed that Saffron had approached Luna Park's owner, Ted Hopkins, several years before the fire, offering to buy the park. In 1985, it was claimed by NSW MP Michael John Hatton that Saffron had beneficial ownership of the park, resulting in an inquiry which concluded that although people related to Saffron were involved in supplying pinball and arcade games to Luna Park, Abe Saffron himself was not linked to the ownership of the park.\n\nBuckingham later denied she made the comments attributed to her and demanded the story not be published, although the \"Herald\" claims her original statements were recorded on tape during a face-to-face interview. The NSW Attorney General has stated the coronial inquiry could be reopened, but would first require the submission of new evidence to the police.\n\nA memorial was dedicated in 1995 to the seven victims of the 1979 fire, with a tree planted next to an antique bench decorated with the names of the victims. During the 2003 redevelopment, the tree was removed and the bench lost. Park director Warwick Doughty claimed that the memorial and events had little relevance, although North Sydney mayor Genia McCaffery, among others, disagreed and campaigned for the memorial's reinstatement. In 2004, a plaque listing the names of the victims was placed on an external wall of the Big Top, which was constructed on the site of the Ghost Train. The plaque was to be the centrepiece of a mural painted by former Park Artist Martin Sharp, but this has never been painted. At least one person present at the unveiling of the plaque was unimpressed with the new memorial.\n\nA memorial park was opened at Lavender Bay by North Sydney Council on 25 August 2007. The \"Art Barton\" Park, named after former Park Artist Arthur Barton, includes a bronze sculpture designed by Michael Leunig dedicated to the victims.\n\nThe Chapel at Waverley College features a memorial to four of the boys who perished in the fire. The memorial features a photo of each boy along with their names on a plaque.\n\n"}

The 60x60 project was conceived and developed by the new music consortium, Vox Novus and its founder, Robert Voisey.\n\n60x60 was designed to showcase the diversity of the contemporary music and has succeeded in presenting thousands of composers in hundreds of performances around the world since 2003. The 60x60 project puts out a call for submissions for recorded media 60 seconds or less in length (also known as signature works.) 60 one-minute works are selected from the submissions. The 60 works are then ordered to create a one-hour music mix. The 60x60 mix is then synchronized with and analogue clock where the beginning of each new minute brings the beginning of a new musical work by a different artist. the 60x60 mix is then presented in several venues throughout the world. Later in the performance season, 60x60 collaborates with artists of different disciplines to create multimedia performances with dance, video, and/or fine arts.\n\nThe performance of 60x60 consists of the 60 works played over loudspeakers in succession without pause for 1 hour. It is played in conjunction with a synchronized analog clock. Works less than 60 seconds are artistically placed within a minute time frame; the rest of the minute is filled with silence until the next minute begins.\n\n60x60's primary focus is to create an artistic representation of the electronic music being created in society today and to present that music to a large audience, \"to represent diverse composers from all walks of life\" Each 60x60 performance mix contains a wide variety of musical styles and aesthetics. \"Founder Robert Voisey said the 60-centric format – inspired by other intermission-free performances in New York – is designed to retain audiences' attention. And through \"60x60,\" he hopes to expose newcomers to electronic music.\"\n\nMore than 2000 composers have been included in the project. A few notable composers in the 60x60 project include: Liana Alexandra, Ernst Bacon, Dennis Bathory-Kitsz, Eve Beglarian, Stephen Betts, Colin Black, James Brody, George Brunner, Warren Burt, Monique Buzzarté, Christian Calon, David Campbell, Robert Carl, Gustav Ciamaga, , Noah Creshevsky, Francis Dhomont, Robert Dick, Emma Lou Diemer, Moritz Eggert, Arne Eigenfeldt, Karlheinz Essl, Carlo Forlivesi, David Gamper, J.

Oteri, Robert W. Parker, Maggi Payne, Sarah Peebles, Anne van Schothorst, Daria Semegen, Alex Shapiro, Judith Shatin, Alice Shields, Juan Maria Solare, Laurie Spiegel, Allen Strange, Robert Scott Thompson, Barry Truax, Eldad Tsabary, Robert Voisey, Jane Wang, Rodney Waschka II, and Hildegard Westerkamp\n\n60x60 is a project in which promotes both established and emerging composers and artists alike. 60x60 is a platform for the contemporary composer to promote his or her career and expose their style and aesthetic to audiences around the world. Some of the emerging composers include: John Akins, Christopher Ariza, Jason Bolte Scott Brickman Mikel Butler, Russel Cannon, Maurilio Cacciatore, Dan Sedgwick, Marji Gere, Nicholas Chase Brad Decker, Kevin Lewis Noah Meites, Mason Leiberman, Michael Pounds, Garry Wickliffe, Greg Yasinitsky\n\nA complete list of composers who participated in the 60x60 project can be found on the 60x60 website\n\nThe 60x60 project is more than just a single performance. It is a venue where a large community of composers and sound artists come together to present their music. Each year after the call for works a Radio Request Extravaganza is held. This is a radio show where any work submitted to the project may be requested for airplay. Afterwards, a selection panels finds 60 works for the 60x60 International mix for that year; when 60 composers of a particular region or style are found an alternate mix is created to represent them. When this happens the project presents the alternate mix as well as the international mix in its concert season. After the project has presented the audio mixes, usually presented with an analog clock, 60x60 collaborates with an artist in a different media. A second performance season is held promoting the multimedia collaboration. In conjunction to the performances of the project a CD is made each year to represent the submissions sent to the project.\n\n60x60 has been presented in various types of venues throughout the world from concert halls to classrooms; from contemporary museums to art galleries; from projections on building walls to installations in storefront windows; from large public atriums to bars and nightclubs. 60x60 uses \"guerrilla\" production tactics to bring it to the broadest audience possible. Some notable venues include: the World Financial Center Winter Garden Atrium, Stratford Circus, The Sheldon the Essl Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the Kemper Museum, the Weisman Art Museum, storefront window at chashama, and Galapagos Art Space. 2010 sees the European debut of 60x60 Dance in London at Stratford Circus.\n\nOther performances include: A*Devantgarde festival, Arts NOW Series, Athena Festival, eArts at Mansfield University, Electronic Music Midwest (EMM) festival, International Electroacoustic Music Festival, EuCuE Free Play: Listening chamber, The Fresno New Music Festival, Kentucky New Music Festival, New Music Days festival, Outside the Box New Music Festival, Spark Festival, Oklahoma Panhandle State University Birmingham New Music Festival, Dance Parade, Sedbergh Music Festival, Minifest Transylvania University's Studio 300: Digital Art and Music Festival, International Sound Art Festival Berlin 2010, and eArts 2010 : Sound & Vision. Toronto Electroacoustic Symposium (TES), 2009 Conference of the Texas Chapter of The National Association of Composers\n\n60x60 has been presented in all forms of media throughout the world including Television, radio, and Internet.\n\n\"Robert Voisey collected and culled 60 musical arrangements from many more submissions, all to inspire the performers and stimulate the audience.\" -Minute to Win It, Alison Sieloff\n\nEmbracing its vision to reach a diverse audience 60x60 has collaborated with artists outside the acoustic medium to create multimedia performances. 60x60 has collaborated with experimental film makers, photographers, improvisational videographers, sculptors, choreographers and dancers. Some of the artists the project has worked with include Viv Moore, Hettie Barnhill, Stephanie Bernard, Andy Haspenpflug, Justine Linnehan, Sabrina Pena Young, Adriana Pegorer, Erin Bomboy, Amiti Perry, Patrick Liddell, Zlatko Ćosić, Jeramy Zimmerman, Gisela Gamper, Shimpei Takeda, and Nick Zedd.\n\n60x60 Dance is a collaboration pairing the 60 audio works with 60 different dances. Exactly like the audio performances, the 60 dances are performed continuously back to back for an hour synchronized with an analog clock. While the music of 60x60 Dance can be from any of the 60x60 mixes, the dancers and choreographers are pooled from the local area where the performance is being held. This creates a \"grassroots\" touring show which is community based utilizing the dancers from the immediate region. 60x60 Dance has had performances at churches, performance art spaces, art galleries, dance clubs, theaters, The Sheldon, and the World Financial Center Winter Garden Atrium where it was described by \"The New York Times\" as a \"masterpiece of organization\"\n\n\n60x60 Dance embraces the same philosophy for its dance performances as it does with its music productions. It is specifically designed to promote and expose to audiences around the world to many different choreographers and dancers with the vast wealth of vary styles and aesthetics that present day dance has to offer. A few of the choreographers who have participated in 60x60 Dance include: Germaul Barnes, Hettie Barnhill, Rob Bettmann, Mary Cochran, Ginger Cox, Tina Croll, Erin Jennings, Jason Dietz Marchant, Vivien Moore, Adriana Pegorer, Amiti Perry, Sasha Soreff, Jessica Stack, Alicia Walsh, Rachel Wynne, Jeramy Zimmerman as well as dance companies: ExtrACTION Dance Theatre, Columbus Movement Movement, Midwest Dance Theater, First Dance Saint Louis, Kari James Dance Network, Stardance, aTrek Dance Collective, and Ashleyliane Dance.\n\n60x60 Video is an hour of video which is synchronized to the audio mixes of 60x60. 60x60 Video has collaborated with video artists, experimental filmmakers, and VJ's to pair the 60 different audio compositions with video.\n\n60x60 Images is a 60x60 multimedia collaboration based on fine art works that are 60 centimeters in length and 60 centimeters in width and then paired with a 60-second audio work in an art installation or performance. the project first started in Teatro Nuovo Giovanni in Udine, Italy with an idea by Vittorio Vella, and Francesca Agostinelli and Taukay Edizioni Musicali The project has since be reproduced in Mexico and in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nIn the beginning of each 60x60 concert season, the project holds a Radio Request Extravaganza. This is an all request radio show where composers and their fans call into the hosting radio station request works that have been submitted to the 60x60 project that year. Different new music radio programs and radio stations host the Extravaganza. In the past the 60x60 Radio Request Extravaganza has been hosted on Relevant Tones hosted by Seth Boustead on WFMT in Chicago, Afternoon New Music on WKCR New York, New York; Martian Gardens Radio Show on WMUA Amherst, Massachusetts; Kalvos & Damian New Music Bazaar on WGDR Plainfield, Vermont; Foldover, on WOBC-FM Oberlin, Ohio; and Sculpted Word on WBAR in New York, New York.\n\nFor the 10th Annual 60x60, Jim Cross on \"What's Next?\" on WGDR hosted a 10-hour marathon of the 60x60 Radio Requset Extravaganza\n\nThe project uses grassroots ideology to grow and promote its mission to expose electroacoustic music. When the project receives more than 60 compositions of a particular theme or from a particular region, the project creates a themed mix to be represent that subsection of its submissions. The project has created many different mixes besides its main \"International Mix\" which is a representative selection of the entire submissions made to the project for that year. Alternate Mixes created by the 60x60 project include: the Athena Mix, the Canada Mix, the UnTwelve Mix, the Presenters Mix, the Pacific Rim Mix,\nMidwest Minutes Mix,\nNew York Minutes Mix,\nUK Mix, Munich Mix, Environmental Mix, the Order of Magnitude Mix (a special 10-hour installation mix of 60x60 containing 600 one-minute works, each by a different composer, and was named the \"Most Composers Programmed In A Single Show\" by The Universal Record Database), the 60x60 Surround Sound Mix utilizing 5.1 Surround Sound and the 2010 ICMC RED Mixes.\n\n360 degrees of 60x60 was a special project of 60x60 created specifically for the International Computer Music Conference at Stony Brook University in 2010. ICMC 2010 was dubbed the \"RED\" edition as an acronym for research, education, and discovery and the 60x60 mixes were named shades of red to commemorate it. The \"RED\" Mixes are a special 60x60 project containing 6 different mixes with 360 different one-minute audio pieces by different composers. Each of the 6 different 1 hour 60x60 mixes are named a shade of red titling the mix: including the Burgundy Mix, Crimson Mix, Magenta Mix, Sanguine Mix, Scarlet Mix, and the Vermilion Mix. The 60x60 \"RED\" mixes have received close to 100 performances in around the world. Patrick Liddell created video for all 6 hours of 360 degrees of 60x60.\n\nThe Athena mix was created in 2011 and it contains works only from women composers. The mix was named after the Athena Festival and was \"macro-composed\" by Sabrina Peña Young The first all women 60x60 mix contained the notable composers: Eve Beglarian, Joan Labarbara, Annea Lockwood, Pauline Oliveros, Maggi Payne, Alice Shields, Daria Semegen, and Laurie Spiegel.\n\"The 60×60 Athena Mix accomplishes much in its showcase of talented women from a global perspective. The 60×60 Athena Mix is a creative way to celebrate International Women's Day, a day set aside to celebrate the accomplishments and achievement of women around the world.\"\n\nIn 2012 Sabrina Peña Young coordinated another Athena Mix of all women composers to contribute to the 60x60 projects decade celebration. The concert performed on International Woman's Day on Friday 8 March 2013 at Harris Museum & Art Gallery in Lancashire, United Kingdom.\n\nThe 60x60 Canada mix contains works from composers from and currently living in Canada. The 60x60 Canada mix started in 2008 with Eldad Tsabary as the macro-composer/music coordinator and co-producer. Two Canadian mixes were created in 2008: a concert version which was premiered at Concordia University as part of the ÉuCuE performance series and a \"SONUS Gallery\" mix that was published in the CEC's (Canadian Electroacoustic Community) electronic journal of electroacoustics, \"eContact!\"\nThe 60x60 (2011) Canada Mix was presented at the 5th Toronto Electroacoustic Symposium (TES) a co-presentation of the Canadian Electroacoustic Community (CEC) and New Adventures in Sound Art (NAISA).\n\nThe 60x60 (2012) Environmental mix is the first 60x60 mix to include work entirely with the theme of nature and the environment both rural and urban.\nComposers from over a dozen countries are represented, and pieces including everything from field recordings at unique locations to sounds from outer space, from insect and animal sounds (yes, birds and bees, and also various pets) to urban noises, to expressions of the feelings people have for the places they inhabit, to lots of water sounds, will be heard. This mix received its premiere in California March 2012 as part of the project's decade celebration.\nRobert Voisey is the audio coordinator for the 60x60 (2012) Environmental Mix.\n\nThe 60x60 Untwelve Mix contains 60 second audio works with tonal systems that go beyond the traditional tonality in Western music and twelve tone music. Started in 2010 in collaboration with UnTwelve, the UnTwelve mix captures the work of composers in the same format as the classic 60x60 concert, however, the emphasis is on pieces whose pitch content is of interest in that it goes beyond the bounds of the traditional 12-tone equal tempered system. Aaron Krister Johnson is the \"macro-composer\" or music coordinator of the 60x60 UnTwelve Mix and co-produced the mix with Robert Voisey at Vox Novus. was The UnTwelve mix had a proto-premiere in Istanbul, Turkey, on April 14, and the official premiere was April 27, 2010, at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. It has since had performances in Kansas City, Missouri (July 23, 2010), Charlestown, Massachusetts (June 9, 2010) and is slated to have a performance at Slippery Rock University, Slippery Rock, PA, on October 7, 2010, and a Chicago repeat performance on October 20, 2010, with video art by Patrick Liddell. The 60x60 UnTwelve Mix also has had several performances in Boston at Mobius, \"Signs of Our 60 Times 60 II\"\n\n60x60 in collaboration with Harvestworks, curator Hans Tammen created the first 60x60 mix utilizing 5.1 Surround Sound premiered at the Harvestworks studios in New York City. Receiving 160 submissions the 60x60 Surround Sound Mix exemplifies the variety possible with the 5.1 speakerref>ICMC Program. Icmc2010.org.

Everything you can do beyond stereo with 5.1 channels is there: 5.1, 5.0, 4.1 and 4.0. There is even a 3.1 work, it does spatialization solely with the center and rear speakers.\" -Curator Hans Tammen\n\n60x60 is a collection of miniatures or \"signature\" works from 60 different composers/sound artists. Each work is 60 seconds (or less) in length and are sequenced in order to fit neatly within each minute of the hour; each new minute is a different piece from a different artist.\n\n60x60 ensures that no individual piece of music lasts too long--you'd be hard pressed to find someone who couldn't sit through one minute of music that didn't appeal to them.\n\n60x60 creates a unique challenge for the composer/sound artist to express themselves in the concise time frame of one minute. Besides that one restriction, artists are free and specifically encouraged to express themselves in any way that they wish.\n\nVoisey states, \"A minute can be plenty of time to express a whole gamut of imaginative sounds and movements, or it can be a challenge, forcing the artist to isolate what is most important in his/her work.\" \n\n60x60 is much more than a collection of short works played one after another. The entire hour of 60 on-minute works is specifically curated or composed as a one-hour-long \"macro-composition\" containing the 60 works. All 60x60 mixes are put together by artists to create an artistic hour for audiences to enjoy.\n\n60×60 involves macro-composition, which Voisey describes as, \"the act of creating a musical work incorporating several fully formed ideas or complete works.\" And just as \"ballet, operas, and movies are all perfect examples of many artists contributing to a greater artistic whole orchestrated by the 'macro-artist',\" \n\nAs the creator and leader of 60x60, Robert Voisey has created and \"macro-composed\" the most mixes and is responsible for the \"main\" annual 60x60 International mix since 2003. He has put together several other 60x60 mixes including: Pacific Rim mixes, Midwest mixes, 2006 New York Minutes Mix, Munich Mix, Electronic Music Midwest Mix, Evolution Mixes, the UK Mix, the Burgundy Mix, the Magenta Mix, the Sanguine Mix and the Scarlet Mix.\n\nSeveral other composers have put together different mixes. Eldad Tsabary has been responsible for putting together the Canadian Mixes as well as the Vermillion mix and the Order of Magnitude Mix. Aaron Krister Johnson was responsible for the UnTwelve Mix and the Crimson Mix. Sabina Pena Young was responsible for putting together the Athena mix. Robert Ratcliffe for the Presenters Mix. Melissa Grey for the 2012 New York Minutes Mix. James Finnerty for the 2012 Canadian Mix. Thomas Gerwin for the 2012 Voice Mix.\n\nThere is a history of electroacoustic \"shorts.\" In 1982, Elliott Sharp created an album of shorts called \"State of the Union\" to accompany an issue of Zone Magazine. In the mid-1980s when the Association pour la création et recherches en électroacoustique de Québec (Acreq) launched an annual competition for \"Electroclips\", most pieces being between one and three minutes in duration. In the late 1980s, Jean-François Denis and Claude Schryer of Montreal, commissioned 25 three-minute pieces for the \"25 instantanés électroacoustiques\", Électro Clips, published by empreinted DIGITALes in 1990, IMED 9004. In 1998, Larry Polansky created \"The Frog Peak Collaborations Project\" a double album of shorts based on an audio sound file from Chris Mann.\n\nIn the tradition of projects before it 60x60 has inspired several electroacoustic miniature projects such as David Morneau's 60x365, where he blogged a 60-second composition once every day for a year.\n\nAnd the miniature form continues in many other projects such as Jon Nelson's 50/50 project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n60x60 Events and Performances\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is the target of the proposed \"AIDA\" asteroid-mission. The asteroid was discovered in 1996, by the Spacewatch survey at Kitt Peak, and its small 170-meter minor-planet moon was discovered in 2003. Due to its binary nature, it was then named \"Didymos\", the Greek word for twin.\n\n\"Didymos\" was discovered on 11 April 1996, by the University of Arizona Steward Observatory's Spacewatch survey using its 0.9-meter telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, United States. The binary nature of the asteroid was discovered by others; suspicions of binarity first arose in Goldstone delay-Doppler echoes, and these were confirmed with an optical lightcurve analysis, along with Arecibo radar imaging on 23 November 2003.\n\n\"Didymos\" orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–2.3 AU once every 2 years and 1 month (770 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.38 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. Its approach to Earth in November 2003, was especially close with a distance of 7.18 million km; it will not come that near until November 2123, with a distance of 5.9 million km. It also passes very close to Mars: 4.69 million km in 2144.\n\nIn the SMASS classification, \"Didymos\" is an Xk-type asteroid, which transitions from the X-type to the rare K-type asteroids. It rotates rapidly, with a period of 2.26 hours and a brightness variation of 0.08 magnitude (), which indicates that the body has a nearly spheroidal shape.\n\n\"Didymos\" is a binary asteroid with a satellite in its orbit. The minor-planet moon, provisionally designated , has an orbital period of 11.9 hours. It measures approximately kilometers in diameter compared to kilometers for its primary (a mean-diameter-ratio of 0.22). It has been informally named \"Didymoon\".\n\nThis minor planet was named \"Didymos\", Greek for \"twin\", due to its binary nature. The name was suggested by the discoverer, University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Lab astronomer Joseph L. \"Joe\" Montani, who made the naming proposal to the International Astronomical Union after the binary nature of the object was detected. The approved naming citation was published on 13 July 2004 (). The moon's nickname, \"Didymoon\", remains unofficial.\n\n\"Didymos\" was the target of the proposed unmanned Asteroid Impact & Deflection Assessment (AIDA) mission, a cancelled collaboration between ESA and NASA. After the cancellation, NASA announced it would proceed with the impactor portion of the mission, called \"DART\". The NASA mission is intended to test whether a spacecraft impact could successfully deflect an asteroid on a collision course with Earth. \"DART\" will be the first spacecraft to intentionally target an asteroid known to have a minor-planet moon (243 Ida was visited by the Galileo spacecraft but its moon was a surprise). \"Didymos\" is the most easily reachable asteroid of its size from Earth, requiring a delta-\"v\" of only 5.1 km/s for a spacecraft to rendezvous, compared to 6.0 km/s to reach the Moon. \"DART\" will be launched in December of 2020 for an impact in October 2022.\n\n\n"}

The yearly festival is held in Kuopio, Finland. The first ANTI Festival was organised in 2002 by The Arts Council of Northern Savonia. The ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival Association was established in 2005 to coordinate the festival.\n\nWith an emphasis on performance, ANTI has established itself as Finland’s foremost presenter of live art while also showcasing new developments in sonic and visual arts. Site-specific and time based works take place in public spaces, on streets, in office buildings, parks, shopping-centres and other privately owned sites, depending on the festival’s theme and the nature of the works. The festival programme consists of artworks created by invited artists and artists selected by an open proposal process.\n\nANTI means ”gift” in Finnish. Therefore, it is very appropriate that the artworks which are presented are free of charge. There is a small fee only for the seminars, artists’ talks and workshops. The ANTI Festival wants to make art more accessible for everybody. People who usually don’t gravitate towards art may become participant viewers of artworks by chance.\n\n24.9.2013 ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival launched a new international art award ANTI Festival International Prize for Live Art which was awarded for the first time in 2014.\n\n2003\n\nIn year 2002 works were presented for example in a hair salon, a gas station and in a nursing home. Main artists of the festival were butch artist Saga Kobayashi from Japan and Live Art artists Eve Dent and Kira O'Reilly from England.\n\n2004\n\nInternational programme included artists from many countries such as Great Britain, Canada, United States of America, Germany, Japan and Netherlands. During four days there were 17 performances. One of them was Will Kwan's (CA) performative lecture in University of Kuopio which was mentioned in media as well as Jennifer Nelson's (US) and Glen Redpath's (CA) work The Race. The Race was held in local super market where it brought running competition and consuming hysteria of Friday afternoon together.\n\n2005\n\nTheme of the year was time. The theme was crystallized by Charles Landry who said: ”It is important that a city does not wipe out its memory”.\n\n2006\n\nSome place might make you laugh. Some place will make you think. Somewhere you will not find art at all. You will walk through the city with a headset on. You will breath the same air with the artist. Somewhere you perhaps will feel strange pleasure. You will not even dare to enter somewhere. Somewhere you might get shocked. You may discover a slight disorder.\n\nThere were 17 artists from all over the world giving their performances in Kuopio City Hall, Väinölänniemi Tennis Court, Youth Center 44, Hotel Puijonsarvi, Huuhanmäki Observatory, Cinema Maxim, an empty property on Tasavallankatu, balcony of the Carlson department store, Kuopio airport, Savonia University of Applied Sciences, Health Professions Kuopio, an apartment mediated by the real estate agency Huoneistokeskus and the office of Reijo Kela.\n\n2007\n\nFor the 2007 edition of the festival a community college, a skateboarding park, the pages of a city newspaper, a late-night grill, a children’s playground and an entire island were negotiated by an international program of artists. One of the most attractive works of the year was the vacuum cleaner’s One Hundred Thousand Pieces of Possibility where the artist gave away 1000 euros in 1 cent pieces. Claire Blundell Jones’s work Introducing Tumbleweed to the Finnish Landscape was also well noticed in media.\n\n2008\n\nFor ANTI 2008 Kuopio's residents opened their homes to audiences and host works made for domestic space. Other projects took place in a sports stadium, on a public stage, across the network of city streets and on, and under, the Rönö bridge.\n\n2009\n\nIn year 2009 the theme of ANTI was walking. For example, Vincent Chevalier (CA) traveled from one place to another walking along a 2-metre length of red carpet by which he gave himself The Red Carpet Treatment. Tim Knowles (UK) in term set off walking and were guided solely by the wind. For this piece he had created a wind vane mounted to a helmet.\n\n2010\n\nThis edition of ANTI concentrated on how artists working with writing and language navigate, read and inhabit the city.\n\n2011\n\n2011 was year of celebration since it was 10th ANTI Festival. There were pieces presented by artists from Great Britain, United States, Canada, Belgium and France. In the programme there was for example Blast Theory’s Rider Spoke which was a work for cyclists who explored the city by bike, looked for places to hide recorded messages and found digital treasures others have hidden, the choir conducted by Heidi Fast and a balloon piece by Gaëtan Rusquet. The festival culminated with Mammalian Diving Reflex’s The Children’s Choice Awards where the only opinions that mattered were those of the kids.\n\n2012\n\nThis year the ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival programme worked on the themes of man's relationship with nature and the connection between sexuality and the body as well as the natural state of the human body. The festival took over public spaces in Kuopio for the 11th time. And not just in the town — the Luonnon ANTI programme set up camp on the island of Karhunsaari as well. A weekend-long artwork and workshop programme were planned especially with children in mind.\n\n2013\n\nAs usual, the ANTI Festival offered unexpected encounters in Kuopio and Northern Savonia. In this, its twelfth year, the international festival of contemporary art spread to other locations too, such as Lapinlahti, Hietasalo island and the smoke sauna in Rauhalahti. In Cruising for Art about 20 Finnish and international artists made over 800 1-to-1 performances around Kuopio. Also the first PechaKucha night in Kuopio was organized during the festival.\n\n2014\n\nChildren and teenagers were in the focus of this year's ANTI – Contemporary Art Festival. The international festival programme consisted of work where the youngest family members or youngsters nearing adulthood were either the theme or an active part of the production. This year the first ever ANTI Festival International Prize for Live Art was awarded. Winner of the first prize was Canadian artist Heather Cassils.\n\nArtistic Directors Mrs. Johanna Tuukkanen and Mr. Erkki Soininen of the ANTI -festival received a Finnish State Prize for the Arts on November 16, 2006.\n\nErkki Soininen was replaced by a Briton, Mr. Gregg Whelan, who was appointed as Co-Artistic Director of ANTI in February 2007. Whelan has participated in ANTI as an artist since 2003. Whelan also works as a performance-maker, writer and co-artistic director of Lone Twin and Lone Twin Theatre.\n\nANTI – Contemporary Art Festival has participated in EU projects A Space for Live Art and Up to Nature.\n\n"}
{"id": "2404374", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2404374", "title": "Academy of Music (Philadelphia)", "text": "Academy of Music (Philadelphia)\n\nThe Academy of Music, also known as American Academy of Music, is a concert hall and opera house located at 240 S. Broad Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Its location is between Locust and Manning Streets in the Avenue of the Arts area of Center City.\n\nThe hall was built in 1855–57 and is the oldest opera house in the United States that is still used for its original purpose. Known as the \"Grand Old Lady of Locust Street,\" the venue is the home of the Pennsylvania Ballet and Opera Philadelphia. It was also home to the Philadelphia Orchestra from its inception in 1900 until 2001, when the orchestra moved to the new Kimmel Center for the Performing Arts. The Philadelphia Orchestra still retains ownership of the Academy.\n\nThe hall was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962.\n\nThe Academy of Music held an inaugural ball on January 26, 1857. At the time \"The New York Times\" described the theater as \"magnificently gorgeous, brilliantly lighted, solidly constructed, finely located, beautifully ornamented\" but went on to lament \"all that lacks is a few singers to render it 'the thing'.\" The theatre had its first opera production, and what was billed as its formal opening, a month later on February 25, 1857, with a performance by the Max Maretzek Italian Opera Company of Verdi's \"Il trovatore\" starring Marietta Gazzaniga as Leonora, Alessandro Amodio as Count di Luna, Zoë Aldini as Azucena, Pasquale Brignoli as Manrico, and Max Maretzek conducting. Maretzek, who was already presenting operas at the Academy of Music in New York City and at the Chestnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia since 1850, brought his company back annually to the Academy of Music in Philadelphia through 1873. Due to his association with both the Philadelphia and New York City Academy of Music venues, his company was sometimes referred to as the Academy of Music Opera Company.\n\nThe Academy has been in continuous use since 1857, hosting many world-famous performers, conductors and composers, and a significant number of American premieres of works in the standard operatic and classical repertoire. Noted operas that had their American premieres there include Strauss's \"Ariadne auf Naxos\", Gounod's \"Faust\", and Wagner's \"The Flying Dutchman\". In 1916, Leopold Stokowski conducted the Philadelphia Orchestra in the American premiere of Mahler's Eighth Symphony (the \"Symphony of a Thousand\").\n\nThe list of artists who have performed at the Academy of Music, from the 20th century, includes such figures as Marian Anderson, Maria Callas, Enrico Caruso, Aaron Copland, Vladimir Horowitz, Gustav Mahler, Anna Pavlova, Edith Piaf, Luciano Pavarotti, Tony Bennett (in 1962), Itzhak Perlman, Leontyne Price, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Artur Rubinstein, Isaac Stern, Richard Strauss, Igor Stravinsky, Joan Sutherland, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, among many others. After the Philadelphia Orchestra moved to the Kimmel Center, the 21st century brought more non-classical artists to the Academy, among them Noel Gallagher who appeared there in 2011.\n\nOutside of arts events, it hosted various public meetings including the 1872 Republican National Convention. Possibly America's first indoor football game took place here in 1889 between the University of Pennsylvania and a club from Princeton resulting in a 0-0 tie. In addition, parts of Martin Scorsese's 1993 film \"The Age of Innocence\" were filmed in the Academy. Despite its name, the Academy has never contained a music school. Various voice and instrumental competitions have taken place there, including the Pavarotti competition.\n\nAn architectural competition for the Academy's design was announced in October 1854 and was won by the Philadelphia firm of Napoleon LeBrun and Gustavus Runge. A style of architecture that originated in Runge's native Germany now known as Rundbogenstil (\"round arch style\") was used for the exterior here and in a number of American buildings of the Civil War Era. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on June 18, 1855, with President Franklin Pierce in attendance and the venue opened with a grand ball on January 26, 1857. The first opera performed there was the Western Hemisphere premiere of Giuseppe Verdi's \"Il Trovatore\", on February 25 of the same year.\n\nIn order to reserve as much of the budget for the interior as possible, the architects designed a relatively plain brick and brownstone exterior that could be clad in marble if funds became available later. The ornate auditorium has an \"open horseshoe\" shape and proscenium columns with elliptical cross-sections in order to provide more direct sight lines from the seats in the side balconies. The auditorium is enclosed by a solid three-foot brick wall with studding and pine boards lining the inner sides to prevent echoes and absorb sound. The upper balconies are recessed in a tiered fashion and supported by 14 Corinthian columns. An unusual feature was that the boxes were originally placed against the rear wall on the second and third levels (Balcony and Family Circle). They were divided from each other by walls that curved down from the ceilings. These have since been removed and boxes created elsewhere. The front of the first balcony is highly ornamented. The hall currently has a seating capacity of 2,389 which can be expanded to 2,509 when seats are placed in the orchestra pit and proscenium boxes. An 1860 account by Runge mentioned that the full auditorium, then nearly 3,000 persons, could be emptied in four minutes in \"great calmness and order\" owing to the wide corridors and stairways.\n\nThe auditorium is graced by a large crystal chandelier, which measures in diameter, and weighs . When installed, the chandelier contained 240 gas jets, which were converted to electricity in 1900, and rewired in 1957. That same year, it was fitted with an electric-powered winch. It previously required 12 people working four-hours to lower it by hand. The fixture was restored to its original form and missing crystals replaced in 2008. The heat produced by the original gas fixtures helped to ventilate the hall by causing air to rise to various vents along the back walls and in the center of the ceiling.\n\nAtop the proscenium is a bas-relief bust of Mozart. Seated on the cornice above are the figures of Poetry, on the left, and Music, on the right. The elaborate carvings and gilded wood sculpture decorations throughout the auditorium are the work of Charles Bushor and Joseph A. Bailly and the ceiling murals of allegorical figures were completed by Karl Hermann Schmolze.\n\nThe original stage curtain was of crimson fabric with heavy golden fringe, ropes, tassels, etc. by J. R. Martin of Berlin. A secondary curtain had a scene of Lake Como, Italy, painted by Russell Smith of Philadelphia.\n\nThe original seating on the Parquet and first balcony had arms and upholstery with springs and a covering of dark red plush fabric. The second balcony had \"sofas without arms\" and the third, pew-like seating. These were mostly replaced with more typical theater seating. The installation of more spacious seating began in 2018.\n\nA 2007 donation of $5.3 million by Leonore Annenberg was designated for restoration of the Academy's ballroom. This was part of the almost $12 million (USD) in donations raised at the 150th anniversary concert for the Academy of Music.\n\nFor many decades, Philadelphia regarded the Academy as having excellent acoustics that were wrongly attributed to a circular brick chamber under the floor of the auditorium. It was intended by the architects that sound penetrating the \"elastic floor\" would reverberate in this chamber and emerge into the auditorium. Unfortunately, this device was ineffective as little sound could pass through the floor in either direction. The ceiling of the auditorium was deliberately designed not to be a sound reflector for fear of echoes.\n\nSome have found the Academy's sound problematic for orchestra:\n\n\"The Academy of Music in Philadelphia is a beautiful, historic, charming building with wholly unsuitable acoustics for orchestra...The dry, unreverberant acoustics results from the roughly 2,900 audience members, who completely surround the volume of the auditorium, soaking up sound as they sit.\"\n\nThe Academy was built as an opera house which typically has a lower reverberation than a concert hall, the venue's primary use for many years. The reverberation time has been measured at 1.4 seconds compared to 1.2 at La Scala, Milan, and 1.75 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Consequently, the \"Philadelphia Sound\" of the Philadelphia Orchestra was, at least in part, the result of long-term efforts by Stokowski, later sustained by Eugene Ormandy, to compensate for this weakness. After some remodeling in the mid-1950s, Ormandy refused to make recordings with the Philadelphia Orchestra in the Academy. Riccardo Muti, Ormandy's successor, also made his commercial recordings with the orchestra elsewhere.\n\nVarious conductors have commented on the quality of the orchestral sound in the hall, as collected by Leo L. Beranek in his book \"Music, Acoustics & Architecture\":\n\nExtensive renovations beginning in 1994 have maintained the building's architecture and made acoustic improvements. Although many programs at the hall are amplified and the Academy is no longer home to the Philadelphia Orchestra, the opera, ballet and other classical concerts still rely on the hall's native acoustics.\n\n\nNotes\n\n"}

The ADLFF has a strong focus on local South Australian and Australian produced content, with the Adelaide Film Festival Investment Fund (AFFIF) established to fund investment in Australian films, of $1,000,000 per festival.\n\nThe AFF featured in Variety Magazine's Top 50 unmissable film festivals around the world.

Amanda Duthie was again the Festival Director. On the opening night of the festival, Director and screenwriter Andrew Bovell received the 2015 Don Dunstan Award for his contribution to the Australian film industry.\n\nThe festival opened with Scott Hicks's documentary film \"Highly Strung\", and closed with Paolo Sorrentino's drama film \"Youth\".\n\nMore than 180 feature films were screened at the festival, 40 of which were Australian films, 24 South Australian films and total of 51 countries were represented at the Festival.\n\nAs part of the 2015 Adelaide Film Festival, a public art installation was presented, incorporating a Laneway Cinema in Cinema Place, showing moving image artworks, and a 'Reactive Wall', where six artists created 2D visual artworks live in response to content within the festival.\n\nThe 6th Adelaide Film Festival took place from 10 to 20 October 2013. This was Amanda Duthie's first year as Festival Director (after eight years at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and eight years at the Special Broadcasting Service during the 1990s), having taken over from Katrina Sedgwick. Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton served as the festival’s patrons.\n\nScott Hicks received the 2013 Don Dunstan Award for his contribution to the Australian film industry.\n\nThe poster in 2013 depicted Screen Worship, which celebrates work for all screens—cinema, television, phone and computer.\n\n"}

His career included participation in the American Civil War. Significant roles included coroner of Kent County, Ontario and surgeon-in-chief.\n\nAnderson Abbott was born in Toronto to Wilson Ruffin and Ellen Toyer Abbott. The Abbotts were a prominent black family in Toronto, who had left Alabama – as free people of color – after their store had been ransacked. After first living a short time in New York, they settled in Upper Canada in 1835 or 1836. Wilson Abbott soon began to purchase real estate, in and around Toronto, where he owned 48 properties by 1871. The senior Abbott also became active in politics.\n\nThe family's prosperity allowed Anderson Abbott to receive an excellent education. He attended both private and public schools, including William King's school, in the black Elgin settlement (now North Buxton, Ontario). He was an honour student at the Toronto Academy and later attended Oberlin College in Ohio. He returned to Canada and in 1857, entered University College in Toronto and in 1858, became a medical student at the Toronto School of Medicine. He studied under Alexander Thomas Augusta, a black physician who was born in the U.S. Although he did not graduate, Abbott received a license to practice from the Medical Board of Upper Canada, in 1861, thus becoming the first Canadian-born, black physician.\n\nAnderson Abbott applied for a commission as an assistant surgeon, in the Union Army, in February 1863. His offer was not accepted, so in April he applied to be a \"medical cadet\" in the United States Colored Troops, before finally entering service as a civilian surgeon under contract. He served in Washington, D.C., from June 1863 to August 1865, starting at the recently opened Freedmen's Hospital (or Contraband Hospital) before moving to a hospital in Arlington, Virginia. While in the army, he achieved the rank of lieutenant-colonel.\n\nOne of only thirteen black surgeons to serve in the American Civil War, Abbott received numerous commendations and became popular in Washington society. This fostered a friendly relationship between Abbott and President Lincoln. On the night of Lincoln's assassination, Abbott accompanied Elizabeth Keckley to attend the stricken president at Petersen House. After Lincoln's death, Mary Todd Lincoln presented Abbott with the plaid shawl that Lincoln had worn to his 1861 inauguration.\n\nIn 1866, Abbott resigned from service to the Union Army and returned to Canada. He attended primary medical classes at the University of Toronto the following year. While he did not graduate, he established a medical practice and was admitted to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario in 1871. In an Anglican wedding ceremony in Toronto on 9 August 1871, he married Mary Ann Casey, the 18-year-old daughter of a successful black barber. Abbott and his wife moved to Chatham where he resumed his medical practice. They eventually had three daughters and two sons.\n\nLike his father, Abbott soon became an important member of the black community in Toronto. From 1873 to 1880, he fought against racially segregated schools as president of the Wilberforce Educational Institute and was appointed coroner for Kent County, Ontario in 1874, the first Black man to hold that office. Abbott contributed to a local newspaper, the \"Chatham Planet\", and was associate editor of the \"Missionary Messenger\", the journal of the local British Methodist Episcopal Church. Abbott was made president of both the Chatham Literary and Debating Society and the Chatham Medical Society in 1878. Abbott moved his medical practice to Dundas, Ontario in 1881 where he also served in some important community roles including trustee of that community's high school and chairman of the town's internal management committee from 1885 to 1889. He also worked as an administrator for the Dundas Mechanics' Institute.\n\nThe family moved to Oakville, Ontario in 1889 but returned to Toronto the following year. He was elected a member of the local post of the Grand Army of the Republic and one of 273 Civil War veterans in Toronto to wear the badge of that fraternity. He was then known as \"Captain Abbott\", a rank which might reflect his office within the Grand Army of the Republic rather than his actual rank during the American Civil War. In November 1892, Abbott was appointed aide-de-camp on the Staff of the Commanding Officers Dept. of New York. A source of great pride for Abbott and his family, this was the highest military honour ever bestowed on a black person in Canada or the United States.\n\nIn 1894, Abbott was appointed surgeon-in-chief at Provident Hospital in Chicago, the first training hospital for black nurses in the United States. He became the hospital's medical superintendent In 1896 but resigned the following year. Returning to Toronto, Abbott resumed his private practice and became more involved with writing for various publications including the \"Colored American Magazine\" of Boston and New York, the \"Anglo-American Magazine\" of London (for which he wrote \"Some recollections of Lincoln's assassination\"), and \"New York Age\". Medicine, Black history, the Civil War, Darwinism, biology, and poetry were among his topics.\n\nAt the turn of the century he became embroiled in the debate between W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington over social change. Siding with Du Bois, Abbott believed that Black access to higher education was essential and should not be compromised. Believing that blacks would be culturally assimilated, Abbott wrote: \"It is just as natural for two races living together on the same soil to blend as it is for the waters of two river tributaries to mingle.\" With Canada's black population on the decline, he thought this was especially true in his own country and wrote \"by the process of absorption and expatriation the color line will eventually fade out in Canada.\"\n\nAnderson Ruffin Abbott died in 1913, at the age of 76, in the Toronto home of his son-in-law, Frederick Langdon Hubbard, (Toronto Transportation Commission Chairman from 1929 to 1930, and son of his long-time friend William Peyton Hubbard). He is buried in the Toronto Necropolis.\n"}
{"id": "429624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429624", "title": "Ask.com", "text": "Ask.com\n\nAsk.com (originally known as Ask Jeeves) is a question answering-focused e-business founded in 1996 by Garrett Gruener and David Warthen in Berkeley, California.\n\nThe original software was implemented by Gary Chevsky from his own design. Warthen, Chevsky, Justin Grant, and others built the early AskJeeves.com website around that core engine. In late 2010, facing insurmountable competition from more popular search engines, the company outsourced its web search technology and returned to its roots as a question and answer site. Douglas Leeds was elevated from president to CEO in 2010.\n\nAsk.com has been criticized for its browser toolbar, which has been accused of behaving like malware due to its bundling with other software and the difficulty of its uninstallation.\n\nThree venture capital firms, Highland Capital Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, and The RODA Group were early investors. Ask.com is currently owned by InterActiveCorp (IAC) under the NASDAQ symbol .\n\nAsk.com's corporate headquarters are located at 555 City Center, in the Oakland City Center development in downtown Oakland, California.\n\nAsk.com was originally known as Ask Jeeves, \"Jeeves\" being the name of a \"gentleman's personal gentleman\", or valet, fetching answers to any question asked. The character was based on Bertie Wooster's valet Jeeves, in the fictional works of P. G. Wodehouse.\n\nThe original idea behind Ask Jeeves was to allow users to get answers to questions posed in everyday, natural language, as well as by traditional keyword searching. The current Ask.com still supports this, with support for math, dictionary, and conversion questions.\n\nIn 2005 the company announced plans to phase out Jeeves and on February 27, 2006, the character disappeared from Ask.com. He was stated to be \"going into retirement.\" However, the UK/Ireland edition of the website prominently brought the character back in 2009.\n\nIAC owns a variety of sites including country-specific sites for UK, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, and Spain along with Ask Kids, Teoma (now ExpertRank) and several others. On June 5, 2007, Ask.com relaunched with a 3D look.\n\nOn May 16, 2006, Ask implemented a \"Binoculars Site Preview\" into its search results. On search results pages, the \"Binoculars\" let searchers have a sneak peek of the page they could visit with a mouse-over activating a pop-up screenshot.\n\nIn December 2007, Ask released the AskEraser feature, allowing users to opt-out from tracking of search queries and IP and cookie values. They also vowed to erase this data after 18 months if the AskEraser option is not set. HTTP cookies must be enabled for AskEraser to function. On July 4, 2008, InterActiveCorp announced the acquisition of Lexico Publishing Group, which owns Dictionary.com, Thesaurus.com, and Reference.com.\n\nOn July 26, 2010, Ask.com released a closed-beta Q&A service. The service was released to the public on July 29, 2010. Ask.com launched its mobile Q&A app for the iPhone in late 2010.\n\nAsk.com now reaches 100 million global users per month through its website with more than 2 million downloads of its flagship mobile app. The company has also released additional apps spun out of its Q&A experience, including Ask Around in 2011 and PollRoll in 2012.\n\nIn 2010, Ask.com abandoned the search industry, with the loss of 130 search engineering jobs, because it could not compete against more popular search engines such as Google. Earlier in the year, Ask had launched a Q&A community for generating answers from real people as opposed to search algorithms then combined this with its question-and–answer repository, utilizing its extensive history of archived query data to search sites that provide answers to questions people have. To avoid a situation in which no answers were available from its own resources, the company outsourced to an unnamed third-party search provider the comprehensive web search matches that it had gathered itself.\n\nFormerly the direct sales engine for Ask.com, Ask Sponsored Listings is no longer available, having merged with Sendori, an operating business of IAC, in 2011.\n\nAsk Jeeves, Inc. stock traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange from July 1999 to July 2005, under the ticker symbol ASKJ. In July 2005, the ASKJ ticker was retired upon the acquisition by IAC, valuing at US$1.85 billion.\n\nIn 2012 Ask.com made two acquisitions as part of a larger strategy to offer more content on the Ask.com website. On July 2, 2012, Ask.com purchased content discovery start-up nRelate, for an undisclosed amount. That was followed by the company's acquisition of expert advice and information site About.com, which closed in September 2012.\n\nOn August 14, 2014, Ask.com acquired popular social networking website ASKfm, where users can ask other users questions, with the option of anonymity. As of August 14, 2014, Ask.fm had 180 million monthly unique users in more than 150 countries around the world, with its largest user base in the United States. Available on the web and as a mobile app, ASKfm generates an estimated 20,000 questions per minute with approximately 45 percent of its mobile monthly active users logging in daily. To date, the mobile app has been downloaded more than 40 million times.\n\nThe Ask browser toolbar is an extension that can appear as an extra bar added to the browser's window and/or menu. In early versions, it was often unintentionally installed during the installation of partner software, including Oracle Java, i.e., taking advantage of a user's lack of technical experience. As an operating business of IAC, Ask Partner Network had also historically entered into partnerships with some software security vendors, whereby they distributed the toolbar alongside their software. Installer packages for partner companies had an option (opt-out) to install the Ask toolbar and/or change the user's default browser home page to Ask.com.\n\nAsk.com and its parent company IAC have therefore been criticized for promoting a toolbar that behaves like malware—that it was surreptitiously bundled with legitimate program installations, e.g., Oracle's Java, that it could not be easily removed from common browsers once installed, that consumers installed the software unwittingly, that the toolbar redefined the user's home page to Ask.com, and that Ask.com presented biased search results. As early toolbar versions could not be easily removed using built-in uninstall features, it was considered a \"potentially unwanted program\". A further criticism was a ten-minute delay that was built into the installation, between updating Java and appearance of the Ask toolbar. The company defended these early business decisions, pointing out that instructions to remove the toolbar could be found at the Ask.com Help Center.\n\nAs of June 2015, Ask.com no longer bundles with Oracle's Java (which now features a Yahoo! toolbar). As of June 2015, Microsoft does not consider the toolbar that is being provided by Ask.com to be unwanted software, but they state that older versions of the toolbar pose \"a high threat to your PC,\" and they provide tools for detecting and removing them.\n\nApostolos Gerasoulis, the co-creator of Ask's Teoma algorithmic search technology, starred in four television advertisements in 2007, extolling the virtues of Ask.com's usefulness for information relevance. A Jeeves balloon appeared in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade through 2000-2004.\n\nAfter a hiatus from mass consumer marketing, Ask returned to TV advertising in the fall of 2011 after refocusing its site on questions and answers. Instead of national advertising, Ask focused on local markets with basic creative. In the summer of 2012, Ask launched a national cinema campaign, along with other out-of-home tactics in certain markets such as New York and Seattle.\n\nAs part of a Seattle-based local market effort, Ask.com launched its\n“You Asked We Answered” campaign in 2012, in which the company “answered” residents' top complaints about living in their city, including easing morning commutes and stadium traffic, as well as keeping the local Parks and Rec department wading pools open.\n\nOn January 14, 2009, Ask.com became the official sponsor of 2000 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion Bobby Labonte's No. 96 Ford. Ask would become the official search engine of NASCAR. Ask.com was the primary sponsor for the No. 96 for 18 of the first 21 races and had rights to increase this to a total of 29 races that season. The Ask.com car debuted in the 2009 Bud Shootout where it failed to finish the race, but subsequently returned strongly, placing as high as 5th in March 1, 2009 Shelby 427 race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Ask.com's foray into NASCAR represented the first instance of its venture into what it calls \"Super Verticals\".\n"}
{"id": "4626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4626", "title": "Broadway (Manhattan)", "text": "Broadway (Manhattan)\n\nBroadway is a road in the U.S. state of New York. Broadway runs from State Street at Bowling Green for through the borough of Manhattan and through the Bronx, exiting north from the city to run an additional through the municipalities of Yonkers, Hastings-On-Hudson, Dobbs Ferry, Irvington, and Tarrytown, and terminating north of Sleepy Hollow in Westchester County.\n\nIt is the oldest north–south main thoroughfare in New York City, dating to the first New Amsterdam settlement, although most of it did not bear its current name until the late 19th century. The name \"Broadway\" is the English language literal translation of the Dutch name, \"Brede weg\".\n\nBroadway in Manhattan is known widely as the heart of the American theatre industry, and is used as a metonym for it.\n\nBroadway was originally the Wickquasgeck Trail, carved into the brush of Manhattan by its Native American inhabitants. Wickquasgeck means \"birch-bark country\" in the Algonquian language. This trail originally snaked through swamps and rocks along the length of Manhattan Island.\n\nUpon the arrival of the Dutch, the trail soon became the main road through the island from \"Nieuw Amsterdam\" at the southern tip. The Dutch explorer and entrepreneur David Pietersz. de Vries gives the first mention of it in his journal for the year 1642 (\"the Wickquasgeck Road over which the Indians passed daily\"). The Dutch named the road \"Breede Weg\". Although current street signs are simply labeled as \"Broadway\", in a 1776 map of New York City, Broadway is explicitly labeled \"Broadway Street\". In the mid-eighteenth century, part of Broadway in what is now lower Manhattan was known as \"Great George Street\". An 1897 City Map shows a segment of Broadway as \"Kingsbridge Road\" in the vicinity of what is now the George Washington Bridge.\n\nIn the 18th century, Broadway ended at the town commons north of Wall Street, where traffic continued up the East Side of the island via Eastern Post Road and the West Side via Bloomingdale Road. The western Bloomingdale Road would be widened and paved during the 19th century, and called \"Western Boulevard\" or \"The Boulevard\" north of the Grand Circle, now called Columbus Circle. On February 14, 1899, the name \"Broadway\" was extended to the entire Broadway/Bloomingdale/Boulevard road.\n\nBroadway once was a two-way street for its entire length. The present status, in which it runs one-way southbound south of Columbus Circle (59th Street), came about in several stages. On June 6, 1954, Seventh Avenue became southbound and Eighth Avenue became northbound south of Broadway. None of Broadway became one-way, but the increased southbound traffic between Columbus Circle (Eighth Avenue) and Times Square (Seventh Avenue) caused the city to re-stripe that section of Broadway for four southbound and two northbound lanes. Broadway became one-way from Columbus Circle south to Herald Square (34th Street) on March 10, 1957, in conjunction with Sixth Avenue becoming one-way from Herald Square north to 59th Street and Seventh Avenue becoming one-way from 59th Street south to Times Square (where it crosses Broadway). On June 3, 1962, Broadway became one-way south of Canal Street, with Trinity Place and Church Street carrying northbound traffic. \n\nAnother change was made on November 10, 1963, when Broadway became one-way southbound from Herald Square to Madison Square (23rd Street) and Union Square (14th Street) to Canal Street, and two routes – Sixth Avenue south of Herald Square and Centre Street, Lafayette Street, and Fourth Avenue south of Union Square – became one-way northbound. Finally, at the same time as Madison Avenue became one-way northbound and Fifth Avenue became one-way southbound, Broadway was made one-way southbound between Madison Square (where Fifth Avenue crosses) and Union Square on January 14, 1966, completing its conversion south of Columbus Circle.\n\nIn 2001, a one-block section of Broadway between 72nd Street and 73rd Street at Verdi Square was reconfigured. Its easternmost lanes, which formerly hosted northbound traffic, were turned into a public park when a new subway entrance for the 72nd Street station was built in the exact location of these lanes. Northbound traffic on Broadway is now channeled onto Amsterdam Avenue to 73rd Street, makes a left turn on the three-lane 73rd Street, and then a right turn on Broadway shortly afterward.\n\nIn August 2008, two traffic lanes from 42nd to 35th Streets were taken out of service and converted to public plazas. Additionally, bike lanes were added on Broadway from 42nd Street down to Union Square.\n\nSince May 2009, the portions of Broadway through Duffy Square, Times Square, and Herald Square have been closed entirely to automobile traffic, except for cross traffic on the Streets and Avenues, as part of a traffic and pedestrianization experiment, with the pavement reserved exclusively for walkers, cyclists, and those lounging in temporary seating placed by the city. The city decided that the experiment was successful and decided to make the change permanent in February 2010. Though the anticipated benefits to traffic flow were not as large as hoped, pedestrian injuries dropped dramatically and foot traffic increased in the designated areas; the project was popular with both residents and businesses. The current portions converted into pedestrian plazas are between West 47th Street and West 42nd Street within Times and Duffy Squares, and between West 35th Street and West 33rd Street in the Herald Square area. Additionally, portions of Broadway in the Madison Square and Union Square have been dramatically narrowed, allowing ample pedestrian plazas to exist along the side of the road.\n\nIn May 2013, the NYCDOT decided to redesign Broadway between 35th and 42nd Streets for the second time in five years, owing to poor connections between pedestrian plazas and decreased vehicular traffic. With the new redesign, the bike lane is now on the right side of the street; it was formerly on the left side adjacent to the pedestrian plazas, causing conflicts between pedestrian and bicycle traffic.\n\nIn spring 2017, as part of a capital reconstruction of Worth Square, Broadway between 24th and 25th Street was converted to a \"shared street\" where through vehicles are banned and delivery vehicles are restricted to . Delivery vehicles go northbound from Fifth Avenue to 25th Street for that one block, reversing the direction of traffic and preventing vehicles from going south on Broadway south of 25th Street. The capital project expands on a 2008 initiative where part of the intersection of Broadway and Fifth Avenue was repurposed into a public plaza, simplifying that intersection. As part of the 2017 project, Worth Square was expanded, converting the adjoining block of Broadway into a \"shared street.\"\n\nBroadway runs the length of Manhattan Island, roughly parallel to the North River (the portion of the Hudson River bordering Manhattan), from Bowling Green at the south to Inwood at the northern tip of the island. South of Columbus Circle, it is a one-way southbound street. Since 2009, vehicular traffic has been banned at Times Square between 47th and 42nd Streets, and at Herald Square between 35th and 33rd Streets as part of a pilot program; the right-of-way is intact and reserved for cyclists and pedestrians. From the northern shore of Manhattan, Broadway crosses Spuyten Duyvil Creek via the Broadway Bridge and continues through Marble Hill (a discontinuous portion of the borough of Manhattan) and the Bronx into Westchester County. U.S. 9 continues to be known as Broadway until its junction with NY 117.\n\nThe section of lower Broadway from its origin at Bowling Green to City Hall Park is the historical location for the city's ticker-tape parades, and is sometimes called the \"Canyon of Heroes\" during such events. West of Broadway, as far as Canal Street, was the city's fashionable residential area until circa 1825; landfill has more than tripled the area, and the Hudson River shore now lies far to the west, beyond Tribeca and Battery Park City.\n\nBroadway marks the boundary between Greenwich Village to the west and the East Village to the east, passing Astor Place. It is a short walk from there to New York University near Washington Square Park, which is at the foot of Fifth Avenue. A bend in front of Grace Church allegedly avoids an earlier tavern; from 10th Street it begins its long diagonal course across Manhattan, headed almost due north.\n\nBecause Broadway preceded the grid that the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 imposed on the island, Broadway crosses midtown Manhattan diagonally, intersecting with both the east-west streets and north-south avenues. Broadway's intersections with avenues, marked by \"squares\" (some merely triangular slivers of open space), have induced some interesting architecture, such as the Flatiron Building.\n\nAt Union Square, Broadway crosses 14th Street, merges with Fourth Avenue, and continues its diagonal uptown course from the Square's northwest corner; Union Square is the only location wherein the physical section of Broadway is discontinuous in Manhattan (other portions of Broadway in Manhattan are pedestrian-only plazas). At Madison Square, the location of the Flatiron Building, Broadway crosses Fifth Avenue at 23rd Street, and is discontinuous to vehicles for a one-block stretch between 24th and 25th Streets. At Greeley Square (West 33rd Street), Broadway crosses Sixth Avenue (Avenue of the Americas), and is discontinuous to vehicles. Macy's Herald Square department store, one block north of the vehicular discontinuity, is located on the northwest corner of Broadway and West 34th Street and southwest corner of Broadway and West 35th Street; it is one of the largest department stores in the world.\n\nOne famous stretch near Times Square, where Broadway crosses Seventh Avenue in midtown Manhattan, is the home of many Broadway theatres, housing an ever-changing array of commercial, large-scale plays, particularly musicals. This area of Manhattan is often called the Theater District or the Great White Way, a nickname originating in the headline \"Found on the Great White Way\" in the edition of February 3, 1902 of the \"New York Evening Telegram\". The journalistic nickname was inspired by the millions of lights on theater marquees and billboard advertisements that illuminate the area. After becoming the city's de facto red-light district in the 1960s and 1970s (as can be seen in the films \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Midnight Cowboy\"), since the late 1980s Times Square has emerged as a family tourist center, in effect being Disneyfied following the company's purchase and renovation of the New Amsterdam Theatre on 42nd Street in 1993.\n\nUntil June 2007, \"The New York Times\", from which the Square gets its name, was published at offices at 239 West 43rd Street; the paper stopped printing papers there on June 15, 2007.\n\nAt the southwest corner of Central Park, Broadway crosses Eighth Avenue (called Central Park West north of 59th Street) at West 59th Street and Columbus Circle; on the site of the former New York Coliseum convention center is the new shopping center at the foot of the Time Warner Center, headquarters of Time Warner. From Columbus Circle northward, Broadway becomes a wide boulevard to 169th Street; it retains landscaped center islands that separate northbound from southbound traffic. The medians are a vestige of the central mall of \"The Boulevard\" that had become the spine of the Upper West Side, and many of these contain public seating.\n\nBroadway intersects with Columbus Avenue (known as Ninth Avenue south of West 59th Street) at West 65th and 66th Streets where the Juilliard School and Lincoln Center, both well-known performing arts landmarks, as well as the Manhattan New York Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are located.\n\nBetween West 70th and 73rd Streets, Broadway intersects with Amsterdam Avenue (known as 10th Avenue south of West 59th Street). The wide intersection of the two thoroughfares has historically been the site of numerous traffic accidents and pedestrian casualties, partly due to the long crosswalks. Two small triangular plots of land were created at points where Broadway slices through Amsterdam Avenue. One is a tiny fenced-in patch of shrubbery and plants at West 70th Street called Sherman Square (although it and the surrounding intersection have also been known collectively as Sherman Square), and the other triangle is a lush tree-filled garden bordering Amsterdam Avenue from just above West 72nd Street to West 73rd Street. Named Verdi Square in 1921 for its monument to Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi, which was erected in 1909, this triangular sliver of public space was designated a Scenic Landmark by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1974, one of nine city parks that have received the designation. In the 1960s and 1970s, the area surrounding both Verdi Square and Sherman Square was known by local drug users and dealers as \"Needle Park\", and was featured prominently in the gritty 1971 dramatic film \"The Panic in Needle Park\", directed by Jerry Schatzberg and starring Al Pacino in his second onscreen role.\n\nThe original brick and stone shelter leading to the entrance of the 72nd Street subway station, one of the first 28 subway stations in Manhattan, remains located on one of the wide islands in the center of Broadway, on the south side of West 72nd Street. For many years, all traffic on Broadway flowed on either side of this median and its subway entrance, and its uptown lanes went past it along the western edge of triangular Verdi Square. In 2001 and 2002, renovation of the historic 72nd Street station and the addition of a second subway control house and passenger shelter on an adjacent center median just north of 72nd Street, across from the original building, resulted in the creation of a public plaza with stone pavers and extensive seating, connecting the newer building with Verdi Square, and making it necessary to divert northbound traffic to Amsterdam Avenue for one block. While Broadway's southbound lanes at this intersection were unaffected by the new construction, its northbound lanes are no longer contiguous at this intersection. Drivers can either continue along Amsterdam Avenue to head uptown or turn left on West 73rd Street to resume traveling on Broadway.\n\nSeveral notable apartment buildings are in close proximity to this intersection, including The Ansonia, its ornate architecture dominating the cityscape here. After the Ansonia first opened as a hotel, live seals were kept in indoor fountains inside its lobby. Later, it was home to the infamous Plato's Retreat nightclub. Immediately north of Verdi Square is the formidable Apple Bank for Savings building, formerly the Central Savings Bank, which was built in 1926 and designed to resemble the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Broadway is also home to the Beacon Theatre at West 74th Street, designated a national landmark in 1979 and still in operation as a concert venue after its establishment in 1929 as a vaudeville and music hall, and \"sister\" venue to Radio City Music Hall.\n\nAt its intersection with West 78th Street, Broadway shifts direction and continues directly uptown and aligned approximately with the Commissioners' grid. Past the bend are the historic Apthorp apartment building, built in 1908, and the First Baptist Church in the City of New York, incorporated in New York in 1762, its current building on Broadway erected in 1891. The road heads north and passes historically important apartment houses such as the Belnord, the Astor Court Building, and the Art Nouveau Cornwall.\n\nAt Broadway and 95th Street is Symphony Space, established in 1978 as home to avant-garde and classical music and dance performances in the former Symphony Theatre, which was originally built in 1918 as a premier \"music and motion-picture house\". At 99th Street, Broadway passes between the controversial skyscrapers of the Ariel East and West.\n\nAt 107th Street, Broadway merges with West End Avenue, with the intersection forming Straus Park with its Titanic Memorial by Augustus Lukeman.\n\nBroadway then passes the campus of Columbia University at 116th Street in Morningside Heights, in part on the tract that housed the Bloomingdale Insane Asylum from 1808 until it moved to Westchester County in 1894. Still in Morningside Heights, Broadway passes the park-like campus of Barnard College. Next, the Gothic quadrangle of Union Theological Seminary and the brick buildings of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America with their landscaped interior courtyards face one another across Broadway. On the next block is the Manhattan School of Music.\n\nBroadway then runs past the proposed uptown campus of Columbia University, and the main campus of CUNY–City College near 135th Street; the Gothic buildings of the original City College campus are out of sight, a block to the east. Also to the east are the brownstones of Hamilton Heights. Hamilton Place is a surviving section of Bloomingdale Road, and originally the address of Alexander Hamilton's house, The Grange, which has been moved.\n\nBroadway achieves a verdant, park-like effect, particularly in the spring, when it runs between the uptown Trinity Church Cemetery and the former Trinity Chapel, now the Church of the Intercession near 155th Street.\n\nNewYork–Presbyterian Hospital lies on Broadway near 166th, 167th, and 168th Streets in Washington Heights. The intersection with St. Nicholas Avenue at 167th Street forms Mitchell Square Park. At 178th Street, U.S. 9 becomes concurrent with Broadway.\n\nBroadway crosses the Harlem River on the Broadway Bridge to Marble Hill. Afterward, it then enters the Bronx, where it is the eastern border of Riverdale and the western border of Van Cortlandt Park. At 253rd Street, NY 9A joins with U.S. 9 and Broadway. (NY 9A splits off Broadway at Ashburton Avenue in Yonkers.)\n\nThe northwestern corner of the park marks the city limit and Broadway enters Yonkers, where it is now known as South Broadway. It trends ever westward, closer to the Hudson River, remaining a busy urban commercial street. In downtown Yonkers, it drops close to the river, becomes North Broadway and 9A leaves via Ashburton Avenue. Broadway climbs to the nearby ridgetop runs parallel to the river and the railroad, a few blocks east of both as it passes St. John's Riverside Hospital. The neighborhoods become more residential and the road gently undulates along the ridgetop. In Yonkers, Broadway passes historic Philipse Manor house, which dates back to colonial America.\n\nIt remains Broadway as it leaves Yonkers for Hastings-on-Hudson, where it splits into separate north and south routes for . The trees become taller and the houses, many separated from the road by stone fences, become larger. Another National Historic Landmark, the John William Draper House, was the site of the first astrophotograph of the Moon.\n\nIn the next village, Dobbs Ferry, Broadway has various views of the Hudson River while passing through the residential section. Broadway passes by the Old Croton Aqueduct and nearby the shopping district of the village. After intersecting with Ashford Avenue, Broadway passes Mercy College, then turns left again at the center of town just past South Presbyterian Church, headed for equally comfortable Ardsley-on-Hudson and Irvington. Villa Lewaro, the home of Madam C. J. Walker, the first African-American millionaire, is along the highway here. At the north end of the village of Irvington, a memorial to writer Washington Irving, after whom the village was renamed, marks the turnoff to his home at Sunnyside. Entering into the southern portion of Tarrytown, Broadway passes by historic Lyndhurst mansion, a massive mansion built along the Hudson River built in the early 1800s.\n\nNorth of here, at the Kraft Foods technical center, the Tappan Zee Bridge becomes visible. After crossing under the Thruway and I-87 again, here concurrent with I-287, and then intersecting with the four-lane NY 119, where 119 splits off to the east, Broadway becomes the busy main street of Tarrytown. Christ Episcopal Church, where Irving worshiped, is along the street. Many high quality restaurants and shops are along this main road. This downtown ends at the eastern terminus of NY 448, where Broadway slopes off to the left, downhill, and four signs indicate that Broadway turns left, passing the Old Dutch Church of Sleepy Hollow, another NHL. The road then enters Sleepy Hollow (formerly North Tarrytown), passing the visitors' center for Kykuit, the National Historic Landmark that was (and partially still is) the Rockefeller family's estate. Broadway then passes the historic Sleepy Hollow Cemetery, which includes the resting place of Washington Irving and the setting for The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\n\nBroadway expands to four lanes at the trumpet intersection with NY 117, where it finally ends and U.S. 9 becomes Albany Post Road (and Highland Avenue) at the northern border of Sleepy Hollow, New York.\n\n\"Canyon of Heroes\" is occasionally used to refer to the section of lower Broadway in the Financial District that is the location of the city's ticker-tape parades.\n\nThe traditional route of the parade is northward from Bowling Green to City Hall Park. Most of the route is lined with tall office buildings along both sides, affording a view of the parade for thousands of office workers who create the snowstorm-like jettison of shredded paper products that characterize the parade.\n\nWhile typical sports championship parades have been showered with some 50 tons of confetti and shredded paper, the V-J Day parade on August 14–15, 1945 – marking the end of World War II – was covered with 5,438 tons of paper, based on estimates provided by the New York City Department of Sanitation.\n\nMore than 200 black granite strips embedded in the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes list honorees of past ticker-tape parades.\n\nThe most recent parade up the Canyon of Heroes took place on July 10, 2015 for the United States women's national soccer team in honor of their 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup championship.\n\n\"The Great White Way\" is a nickname for a section of Broadway in Midtown Manhattan, specifically the portion that encompasses the Theater District, between 42nd and 53rd Streets, and encompassing Times Square.\n\nIn 1880, a stretch of Broadway between Union Square and Madison Square was illuminated by Brush arc lamps, making it among the first electrically lighted streets in the United States. By the 1890s, the portion from 23rd Street to 34th Street was so brightly illuminated by electrical advertising signs, that people began calling it \"The Great White Way\". When the theater district moved uptown, the name was transferred to the Times Square area.\n\nThe phrase \"Great White Way\" has been attributed to Shep Friedman, columnist for the \"New York Morning Telegraph\" in 1901, who lifted the term from the title of a book about the Arctic by Albert Paine. The headline \"Found on the Great White Way\" appeared in the February 3, 1902, edition of the \"New York Evening Telegram\".\n\nA portrait of Broadway in the early part of the 20th century and \"The Great White Way\" late at night appeared in \"Artist In Manhattan\" (1940) written by the artist-historian Jerome Myers:\n\nFrom south to north, Broadway at one point or another runs over or under various New York City Subway lines, including the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, the BMT Broadway Line, IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, and IND Eighth Avenue Line (the IND Sixth Avenue Line is the only north-south trunk line in Manhattan that does not run along Broadway).\n\nEarly street railways on Broadway included the Broadway and Seventh Avenue Railroad's Broadway and University Place Line (1864?) between Union Square (14th Street) and Times Square (42nd Street), the Ninth Avenue Railroad's Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues Line (1884) between 65th Street and 71st Street, the Forty-second Street, Manhattanville and St. Nicholas Avenue Railway's Broadway Branch Line (1885?) between Times Square and 125th Street, and the Kingsbridge Railway's Kingsbridge Line north of 169th Street. The Broadway Surface Railroad's Broadway Line, a cable car line, opened on lower Broadway (below Times Square) in 1893, and soon became the core of the Metropolitan Street Railway, with two cable branches: the Broadway and Lexington Avenue Line and Broadway and Columbus Avenue Line.\n\nThese streetcar lines were replaced with bus routes in the 1930s and 1940s. Before Broadway became one-way, the main bus routes along it were the New York City Omnibus Company's (NYCO) 6 (Broadway below Times Square), 7 (Broadway and Columbus Avenue), and 11 (Ninth and Amsterdam Avenues), and the Surface Transportation Corporation's M100 (Kingsbridge) and M104 (Broadway Branch). Additionally, the Fifth Avenue Coach Company's (FACCo) 4 and 5 used Broadway from 135th Street north to Washington Heights, and their 5 and 6 used Broadway between 57th Street and 72nd Street. With the implementation of one-way traffic, the northbound 6 and 7 were moved to Sixth Avenue.\n\n, Broadway is served by the M4 (ex-FACCo 4), M7 (ex-NYCO 7), M55, M100, and M104. Other routes that use part of Broadway include the M5 (ex-FACCo 5), M10, M20, M60 Select Bus Service, Bx7, Bx9, and Bx20.\n\nBee-Line buses also serves Broadway within Riverdale and Westchester County. Routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 13, and several others run on a portion of Broadway.\n\nBroadway is lined with many famous and otherwise noted and historic buildings, such as:\n\nHistoric buildings on Broadway that are now demolished include:\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

The event was founded by Martin Swig and Ken Shaff in 1991.\n\nThe California Mille is open to cars that either ran or would have been eligible to run in the original event; hence participants cars must be designs from 1957 or earlier. The California Mille field is limited to 65 cars and applicants are screened for their car's historical significance and general condition; not all applicants are accepted. Fields generally include vintage Alfa Romeos, Ferraris, Mercedes-Benz and Porsches. Often pre-war examples are well represented in the fields as well as the more common post-war models.\n\nEach year's event covers no less than 1000 miles over four days. Though the route changes each year, it invariably starts at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco and consists of back roads through some California's most scenic areas, including Highway 1 along Northern California's coast, Napa and Sonoma valleys, and the Sierra Nevadas. Each day is punctuated by several stops for meals and refreshments, arrangements having been made at significant wineries and restaurants, while overnight accommodation is generally at some of California's best hotels.\nA California Highway Patrol escort accompanies the group to facilitate traffic control and communications. \n\nThe event was founded in 1991 by automotive enthusiast Martin Swig and friends, it is supported by an informal group called the \"Amici americani della Mille Miglia\" (\"American friends of the Mille Miglia\" in Italian). The event attracts a number of corporate sponsors which have included Daimler-Chrysler, Jaguar and Il Fornaio restaurants. The corporate sponsorship ensures that the California Mille remains one of the more exclusive and high quality events of its type. It does this by underwriting a substantial entourage of mechanical support and press that follows the event route. The event's proceeds benefit causes such as the 11-99 Foundation, a benefit fund for California Highway Patrol officers and their families.\nParticipants range from run-of-the-mill enthusiasts, though wealthy people by most standards, to captains of the automotive industry and motor sport figures, including Bob Lutz. The event has attracted participants from throughout the world, including South America, Australia, Japan, and Europe.\n\n"}

Taking just less than 10 seconds, the building collapsed and transformed the 6-storey complex into a pile of rubble, leaving only the front elevator hall which was separately built from the rest of the structure. Gradual deformation due to creep weakened all the ground floor support columns and when one failed the rest rapidly followed, resulting in an almost complete vertical collapse. Several people were rescued from the rubble and trapped victims called for help using mobile phones. Violation of safety regulations and an unprofessional approach on the part of the engineer were deemed to be the cause of the disaster. Police arrested the owner of the building and five others. Rescue operations continued for more than 20 days, until 3 September. It is considered to be one of the most fatal and disastrous man-made accidents in Thai history.\n\nThe Royal Plaza Hotel, in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, was hosting two conference meetings at the moment when the collapse occurred. At the time of the collapse, there were 379 people in the building. Of these, 117 were government officials from the Education Ministry, who were attending a seminar in Benchamas Room on the second floor, 59 were from the Shell Company on the fourth floor in Pikul-Chuanchom Room, and 78 were general hotel clients. The rest of the 125 victims were hotel staff.\n\nThe main reason for the collapse was the addition of floors without properly considering the strength of the structure and soil stability. The original permit, issued in 1983, was for a three-storey building with one underground floor and later during 1985 local authorities approved conversion of the building to a hotel but construction permission was not officially sought for the three additional floors until 1990. There were many errors including not strengthening foundations and columns, and not assessing the strength of the existing columns which later culminated in one of the worst building tragedies of Thailand.\n\nOn 15 August 1993, two days after the incident, the Civil Engineering Chapter of the Engineering Institute of Thailand (EIT) immediately established a technical investigation group to support the Task Force at the site. The investigation mainly focused on solving two conundrums:\n\n\nCriminal charges were filed against fifteen people, including the hotel owner and management, engineers and municipal officials. Only engineer Bampen Panratissara was found guilty by the Supreme Court, and sentenced in 2003 to 37 years in prison.\n\nIn 2009, the Nakhon Ratchasima Court of Appeals charged five defendants for 152.23 million baht as compensation to the companies and the victims' families who suffered from this disaster that killed 137 people. These five defendants include Nakhon Ratchasima Municipality, Wongsinthai Limited Partnership, the Royal Plaza hotel owner Amorn Janrattanaprada, engineer Sathorn Promnin, and design-and-construction supervising engineer Bampen Panratissara.\n\n"}

Protest from Indian authorities often led to apologies from US officials. Unlike the United States, India frequently exempts diplomats and other well-known figures from airport security checks.\n\nBollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan was at the centre of three well-publicised incidents. On 15 August 2009, he was detained at Newark while on his way to celebrate India's Independence Day in Chicago.

It occurred on 26 December 2004 at 00:58:50 UTC (07:58:50 local time in Jakarta and Bangkok).\n\nThere were approximately 2300 Finnish citizens on package tours in Thailand, and 600 in Sri Lanka, at the time of the earthquake. The number of independent travellers has not been confirmed. By 31 May 2005, a total number of 179 Finns have been proclaimed dead as caused by the tsunami; as of October 2006, one adult and three children were still officially missing in the affected areas. One person went missing in Sri Lanka and 178 in Thailand. Eight Finnish casualties had resided in Phuket island, and 170 in Khao Lak beach, which was the area in Thailand hardest hit by the catastrophe. 106 Finns went missing from the hotel Blue Village Pakarang in Khao Lak.\n\nAmong the dead were an executive from Finland's Pfizer, Harriet Eckstein, and a popular rock and jazz musician, Aki Sirkesalo. Among those who escaped was the future President of Finland, Sauli Niinistö, who saved himself from the tsunami wave by climbing onto a lamppost with his two sons in Khao Lak.\n\nThe Finnish government officials were heavily criticised for their slow response to help those citizens affected by the events. There were a high number of travellers in the affected areas in need of information on lost relatives, help to find travel documents to get back home, and generally in need to get evacuated in an organised manner. In Finland, thousands of relatives needed information regarding family members that may have been in the area. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received the most criticism, mostly by not providing enough emergency telephone services during Boxing Day and the days following.\n\nOne of the reasons for the government's slow response, as has been claimed, was the general lack of information about the situation, and the lack of readiness to organise evacuation efforts in politically stable foreign locations. In Sweden, the country in Europe with the highest number of casualties as a result of the tsunami, widespread criticism towards the government led to the resignations of top politicians, but these consequences didn't occur in Finland.\n\nIn response for the need to coordinate rescue and evacuation efforts for Finnish people in Thailand, a group of Finnish scuba divers started collecting namelists of the ones missing and the ones in safe locations, and sending them as text messages to the homeland to be published in lists in the Sukellus.fi website. This operation was led by entrepreneurs Janne Miikkulainen and Jani Mäkinen from Raya Divers, a scuba diving firm based in Phuket, and by internet entrepreneur Alex Nieminen and journalist Petri Ahoniemi in Helsinki. Miikkulainen, Mäkinen and a crew of tourist agents also circulated hospitals and evacuation centers around Khao Lak and Phuket in order to find Finnish people and give them information about the situation.\n\nJanne Miikkulainen was awarded a Cross of Merit of the Order of the Lion of Finland for his work during and after the catastrophe. The others hosting the Sukellus.fi-website received a State information award.\n\n"}

It takes place at a former military airport called Müritz Airpark in Lärz, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, in northeastern Germany. The festival name is often depicted in Cyrillic letters as Фузион, but pronounced like the English word fusion []. The annual festival was started by the \"Kulturkosmos\" organisation in 1997. It lasts four to six days, usually at the end of June. In 2016, the Fusion Festival event took place from June 29 - July 3, and which has attracted some 70,000 attendees for each year's festival, since the 2013 event, which the comparable American Burning Man event only matched in 2015.\n\nDifferent musical styles are represented at the festival, but the line up is not released beforehand. Mostly electronic music is present, but there is no stylistic restriction for the various live music acts, and the festival attendees may bring their own instruments. \nThe festival also holds its own film festival and features different scales of art installations. Attendees may bring their own art and appear in artistic costumes. Only vegetarian food is sold at the festival grounds.\n\nThe festival gears to create a Temporary Autonomous Zone and a transformational environment. Due to its avantgardistic attitude and the variety of art, the Fusion Festival has been described as a \"European Burning Man\".\n\nThe Fusion Festival combines all styles of the underground electronic music scene and various other styles, sometimes depending on the attendees who choose to play their own music. It is described as a space people go to free their minds from their everyday lives, jobs, studies and other responsibilities. It is the result of the search for an alternative through music, to the system \"people are forced to live in\". People go to the Fusion to experience a different way of socializing and living, where experiencing one another freely, sharing love for music and art connects different scenes and minds. It is a clothing-optional event. Art installations include performance arts, static artworks, sculptures, art cars and various other forms.\n\nFusion Festival began in 1997 near the city of Lärz in north-eastern Germany, about from Berlin and from Hamburg.\n\nThe location is on the original grass-covered grounds of the disused \"Erprobungsstelle Rechlin\" Third Reich-era central military experimental airfield (at for the 234-hectare area central field) about due north of the modern Rechlin-Lärz Airfield facility. The site was first acquired by the German Empire in 1916 as an aviation research and training ground, opening the facility for use by the \"Luftstreitkräfte\" in August 1918. After the establishment of the Luftwaffe in 1935, the field served as the \"Erprobungsstelle Rechlin\" central military aircraft test facility of the Third Reich through early 1945, and it was captured by the Soviet Red Army on May 2, 1945, for use by the VVS. There are grass-covered concrete hangars (actual bunkers) from that time that were used for Soviet fighter aircraft (hence the Cyrillic transliteration of the festival name and various stages, as many Cyrillic inscriptions were still present on the site). The airfield was reopened for civilian use in 1994 and sold to the \"Müritz Airpark Group\" in 2010.\n\n\n"}

After graduation, Dennis was excused from wartime military service because of poor hearing, and commenced an apprenticeship as an embalmer at Ballard. He graduated from the \"San Francisco College of Mortuary Science\" on 22 December 1946 and was put in charge of Ballard's military contract, which included ambulance and mortuary services for the nearby Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF).\n\nDennis came to the attention of UFO researchers in 1989 when he called the hotline after an episode of \"Unsolved Mysteries\" featured the Roswell UFO incident. He was the first witness to confirm claims of alien bodies at the Roswell base itself.\n\nDennis’ accounts featured prominently in \"Crash at Corona\" published in 1992 and \"The Truth About the UFO Crash at Roswell\", published in 1994, as well other pro-UFO books, but serious doubts about his story were soon raised. For some, like Karl Pflock and Kevin Randle, these inconsistencies were great enough to discount Dennis’ credibility entirely.\n\nSeveral researchers, including Karl Pflock, investigated Dennis’s claims and found a number of inconsistencies, including the identity of a nurse who Dennis claimed was a witness to the alleged alien autopsies and the need for Dennis's own involvement in any embalming process when qualified pathologists were said to have performed the autopsies. Pflock also questioned the validity of sketches of aliens provided by Dennis.\n\nDennis's account is repeated in \"Witness to Roswell: Unmasking the 60-Year Cover-Up\" by Thomas Carey and Donald Schmitt, published in 2007. Regarding Dennis providing researchers with a false name, they write, \"His surprising and disappointing response was... 'I gave you a phony name, because I promised her that I would never reveal it to anyone'.\" The authors then comment that \"Dennis was found to have knowingly provided false information to investigators, and must technically stand impeached as a witness.\" However, the book also notes that other witnesses \"have told us that Dennis had told them about the phone calls for child-sized caskets way back when it happened\" and that \"Dennis had told them about his run-in at the base hospital long before Roswell became a household word.\" \n\n\n"}

The show began its long national tour at the end of August 1921 and continued on for some time after Bacon’s death in November 1922. \"Lightnin' \" was revived in 1938 for a two-month run at the John Golden Theatre with Fred Stone playing Lightnin’ Bill Jones and was adapted for cinema twice in films starring Jay Hunt (1925) and Will Rogers (1930).\n\nThe story takes place in the mythical town of Calivada where Lightnin' Bill Jones, or more correctly his wife, operates a rather seedy hotel that straddles the California-Nevada state line convenient for those looking for a quick Nevada divorce. He is nicknamed Lightnin’ because, as the local postmaster put it, “We call him Lightnin’ because he ain’t.”\n\nLightnin’ Bill, a Civil War veteran known to brag that he advised General Ulysses S.

{"id": "2492291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2492291", "title": "Lyceum Theatre, London", "text": "Lyceum Theatre, London\n\nThe Lyceum Theatre (pronounced ly-CEE-um) is a 2,100-seat West End theatre located in the City of Westminster, on Wellington Street, just off the Strand. The origins of the theatre date to 1765. Managed by Samuel Arnold, from 1794 to 1809 the building hosted a variety of entertainments including a circus produced by Philip Astley, a chapel, and the first London exhibition of waxworks displayed by Madame Tussaud. From 1816 to 1830, it served as The English Opera House. After a fire, the house was rebuilt and reopened on 14 July 1834 to a design by Samuel Beazley. The building was unique in that it has a balcony overhanging the dress circle. It was built by the partnership of Peto & Grissell. The theatre then played opera, adaptations of Charles Dickens novels and James Planché's \"fairy extravaganzas\", among other works.\n\nFrom 1871 to 1902, Henry Irving appeared at the theatre in, especially, Shakespeare, usually starring opposite Ellen Terry. In 1904 the theatre was almost completely rebuilt and richly ornamented in Rococo style by Bertie Crewe, but it retained Beazley's façade and grand portico. It played mostly melodrama over the ensuing decades. The building closed in 1939 and was set to be demolished, but it was saved and converted into a Mecca Ballroom in 1951, styled the Lyceum Ballroom, where many well-known bands played. The Lyceum was closed in 1986 but restored to theatrical use in 1996 by Holohan Architects. Since 1999, the theatre has hosted \"The Lion King\".\n\nIn 1765, a building was erected on an adjacent site by the architect James Payne for the exhibitions of The Society of Artists, which disbanded three years later when the Royal Academy of Arts succeeded it. The building was then leased out for dances and other entertainments, including musical entertainments by Charles Dibdin. Famed actor David Garrick also performed there. In 1794, the composer Samuel Arnold Sr rebuilt the interior of the building, making it into a proper theatre, but through the opposition of the existing patent theatres, he was not granted a patent. Therefore, he leased it to other entertainments again, including Philip Astley, who brought his circus there when his amphitheatre was burned down at Westminster. It was also used as a chapel, a concert room, and for the first London exhibition of waxworks displayed by Madame Tussauds in 1802.\n\nThe theatre finally became a licensed house in 1809, and until 1812 it was used for dramatic performances by the Drury Lane Company after the burning of their own theatre, until the erection of the new edifice. It staged one of the earliest tableaux vivants, as part of William Dimond's \"The Peasant Boy\" in 1811. In 1816, Samuel Arnold rebuilt the house to a design by Beazley and opened it as The English Opera House, but it was destroyed by fire in 1830. The house was famous for hosting the London première of Mozart's opera \"Così fan tutte\" (9 May 1811) and as the first theatre in Britain to have its stage lit by gas (6 August 1817). During this period, the \"Sublime Society of Beef Steaks,\" which had been founded in 1735 by theatre manager Henry Rich, had its home at the theatre for over 50 years until 1867. The members, who never exceeded twenty-four in number, met every Saturday night to eat beefsteaks and drink port wine.\n\nIn 1834, the present house opened slightly to the west, with a frontage on Wellington Street, under the name Theatre Royal Lyceum and English Opera House. The theatre was again designed by Beazley and cost £40,000. The new house championed English opera rather than the Italian operas that had played earlier in the century. Composer John Barnett produced a number of works in the first few years of the theatre, including \"The Mountain Sylph\" (1834), credited as the first modern English opera. It was followed by \"Fair Rosamund\" in 1837 and \"Farinelli\" in 1839 (both at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane), and \"Blanche of Jersey\" here in 1840. In 1841–43, composer Michael William Balfe managed the theatre and produced National Opera here, but the venture was ultimately unsuccessful. From 1844 to 1847 the theatre was managed by husband and wife team Robert Keeley and Mary Anne Keeley, during which period the house became associated with adaptations of Charles Dickens's novels and Christmas books. For instance, an adaptation of Dickens' \"Martin Chuzzlewit\" ran for over 100 performances from 1844–45 here, a long run for the time.\n\nThe Lyceum was later managed by Madame Lucia Elizabeth Vestris and Charles James Mathews from 1847–55, who produced James Planché's \"[fairy] extravaganzas\" featuring spectacular stage effects. Their first big success was John Maddison Morton's \"Box and Cox\". Tom Taylor's adaptation of \"A Tale of Two Cities\", with Dickens himself as consultant, played in 1860, shortly after end of its serialisation and volume publication. Charles Fechter, who managed the theatre from 1863–67 also favored spectacular productions. In 1866, Dion Boucicault's \"The Long Strike\" (his adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's Manchester novels \"Mary Barton\" and \"Lizzie Leigh\") was produced here. Ethel Lavenu, the mother and grandmother of actors Tyrone Power, Sr. and Tyrone Power performed in a number pieces at the theatre in the 1860s. W. S. Gilbert produced three plays here. In 1863, his first professional play, \"Uncle Baby\", premièred. In 1867, he presented his Christmas pantomime, called \"Harlequin Cock Robin and Jenny Wren\", and in 1884, he produced the drama \"Comedy and Tragedy\".\n\nIn 1889, the world's finest Italian dramatic tenor, Francesco Tamagno, appeared at the Lyceum, singing the leading role in the first London production of Giuseppe Verdi's opera \"Otello\".\n\nBeginning in 1871, under manager Hezekiah Linthicum Bateman and his wife, Henry Irving appeared at the theatre in, among other things, many Shakespeare works. Irving began with the French melodrama \"The Bells\", an instant hit in which he played the ghost-haunted burgomaster. The piece ran to sell-out crowds for 150 nights, which was an unusually long run at the time. \"Charles I\", in 1872 was another hit, running for 180 nights. In 1874, Irving played \"Hamlet\" at the theatre, perhaps his greatest triumph, running for 200 nights. In 1878, after Bateman's death, Irving took over management of the theatre from his widow. \"The Builder\", 28 September 1878 reported that there was a difference between Irving and Mrs. Bateman regarding the personnel of the company at the Lyceum. \"Mr. Irving is said to have told Mrs. Bateman that he was resolved to have actors to act with him, and not dolls, otherwise he would no longer play at the Lyceum. The result was that Mrs. Bateman threw up the management of the theatre, and Mr. Irving takes her place.\" Mrs. Bateman became the manager of Sadler's Wells Theatre.\n\nIrving continued to star in plays there, especially Shakespeare, until 1902, engaging co-star Ellen Terry for that entire period of 24 years. Bram Stoker worked between 1878 and 1898 as business manager of the theatre, and Irving was Stoker's real-life inspiration for the character Count Dracula in his 1897 novel, \"Dracula\". Stoker hoped that Irving, with his dramatic, sweeping gestures, gentlemanly mannerisms, and speciality in playing villain roles, would play Dracula in the stage adaptation of his novel. However, Irving never agreed to appear in the stage version, although the play was produced at the Lyceum.\nIrving and Terry began with \"Hamlet\" in 1878. Their 1879 production of \"The Merchant of Venice\" ran for an unusual 250 nights, and success followed success in the Shakespeare canon as well as in other major plays. Other celebrated productions included \"Much Ado About Nothing\", \"The Lady of Lyons\" by Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1878), \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"King Lear\", \"The Lyons Mail\" by Charles Reade (1883), the immensely popular \"Faust\" by William Gorman Wills (1885, which even drew applications for reserved seats from foreigners), \"Macbeth\" (1888, with incidental music by Sir Arthur Sullivan), \"Henry VIII\" (1892), \"Becket\" by Alfred Tennyson (1893), \"King Arthur\" by J. Comyns Carr, with incidental music by Sir Arthur Sullivan (1895), \"Cymbeline\" (1896) and Victorien Sardou and Émile Moreau's play \"Madame Sans-Gêne\" (1897).\n\nWhen Irving and Terry toured America, as they did several times beginning in 1883, the theatre played works with many famous actors including Johnston Forbes-Robertson, Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Sarah Bernhardt and Eleonora Duse. Martin Harvey, a pupil of Irving's played a season there in 1899. Benoît-Constant Coquelin appeared as Cyrano de Bergerac in the summer of 1898.\n\nAfter being bought by Thomas Barrasford, in 1904 the theatre was rebuilt and richly ornamented in rococo style by Bertie Crewe, retaining only the façade and portico of the original building. The theatre presented music hall and variety, in an attempt to compete with the Palace Theatre and the new Stoll built London Coliseum, but this was not a success, and the theatre soon returned to presenting drama. From 1909–38 the Melville Brothers ran a successful series of spectacular melodramas. In 1919, additional minor alterations to the theatre were made by Edward Jones. Between the wars, dramas played at the theatre for ten months each year, followed by Christmas pantomimes, including \"Queen of Hearts\" in 1938. The Lyceum was the last London theatre to continue the early practice of concluding pantomimes with a harlequinade, a free standing entertainment of slapstick clowning, juggling and tumbling. The tradition ended with the closure of the theatre in 1939.\n\nIn 1939, the London County Council bought the building, with plans to demolish it to make room for road improvement. The theatre closed that year with a landmark performance of \"Hamlet\" directed by Sir John Gielgud (Ellen Terry's great nephew). The road improvement plans collapsed, and after the war, in 1945, it was converted to a huge ballroom and reopened by Matthews and Sons, as the Lyceum Ballroom. The Miss World contest was staged at the venue every year from 1951 to 1968. Many big bands played here, including the Oscar Rabin Band which performed frequently. In the 1960s and 1970s, the theatre was used as a pop concert venue and for television broadcasts. The Grateful Dead, The Groundhogs, The Clash, Bob Marley and the Wailers, Led Zeppelin, Queen, The Police, The Who, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Colosseum, U2, The Smiths and Culture Club all played here. Bob Marley and the Wailers recorded their \"Live!\" album here on 18–19 July 1975. Genesis filmed a performance there in May 1980 for broadcast on the \"Old Grey Whistle Test\". This footage appears on the 2007 CD/DVD re-release of their 1980 album \"Duke\".\nA proposed redevelopment of Covent Garden by the GLC in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby Vaudeville, Garrick, Adelphi and Duchess theatres. An active campaign by Equity, the Musicians' Union, and theatre owners under the auspices of the \"Save London Theatres Campaign\" led to the abandonment of the scheme. In 1973, the theatre gained protection and was Grade II* listed as \"Interior despite adaptation and alteration for present ballroom use retains [a] substantial part of Crewe's work\".\n\nThe theatre went dark in 1986, after the National Theatre's promenade performances (in 1985) of Bill Bryden's adaptation of the \"Mysteries\" trilogy. Brent Walker leased the theatre during this time but later gave up his lease, and in 1996 it was restored and reconverted into a theatre for large-scale musicals or opera (with a suitably large orchestra pit) by Holohan Architects. A production of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" played from 1996 to 1998.\n\nThe theatre has been home to the musical theatre version of \"The Lion King\" since 1999. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the production, which has grossed over £289 million and been seen by more than eight million people, 250 former cast members gathered onstage, together with designer-director Julie Taymor. Prime Minister David Cameron and actor James Earl Jones, who voiced the role of King Mufasa in the original Disney animated film, attended the performance.\n\n\nSources:\n\n"}

He was a cousin of the prominent Abbasid general Khaydhar ibn Kawus al-Afshin, thus belonging to the ruling family of Ushrusana. Mankjur accompanied al-Afshin in his campaign against the Khurramite Babak Khorramdin, and was later appointed as governor of Adharbayjan by him in 837. However, in 839, Mankjur, after refusing to give the caliph al-Mu'tasim some of Babak's booty, revolted against him. Al-Mu'tasim responded by sending against him Bugha al-Kabir, who managed to suppress his revolt and imprison him in Samarra. The affair of Mankjur raised suspicions about the loyalty of the al-Afshin, who was accused of encouraging the revolt, and contributed to the general's own downfall in the following year.\n\nMankjur's \"nisbah\" is given variously by the sources as \"al-Ushrusani\" or \"al-Farghani\", respectively indicating an origin from the Central Asian provinces of Ushrusana or Farghana. Historian Clifford Edmund Bosworth believed that the first element of Mankjur's name may have been a corruption of the Turkish \"\"ming/bing\" '1,000' or \"mengü\" 'eternal, everlasting,'\" and that Mankjur may have been a Turkish slave soldier imported into Farghana prior to entering caliphal service.\n\nAccording to Vladimir Minorsky, the Mingechaur ford (now the Mingachevir reservoir) of the Kura River was named after Mankjur, who may have been active in the area during his time in Adharbayjan.\n\nMankjur was a kinsman of the Ushrusanan ruler al-Afshin, one of the leading military figures during the caliphate of al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842); according to al-Ya'qubi he was the uncle of one of al-Afshin's sons. During al-Afshin's campaign against the Khurramite rebel Babak Khorramdin in Adharbayjan (835–837), Mankjur was dispatched by the general to fight against a separate revolt in Warthan. In 837, following the victory over Babak, Mankjur was appointed by al-Afshin to serve as his resident governor of Adharbayjan, while al-Afshin himself departed the province and returned to Samarra.\n\nAccording to al-Tabari, Mankjur was believed to have acted in a corrupt manner during his governorship, appropriating for himself a large sum of money hidden away by Babak rather than forwarding it to the caliph. His alleged activities were soon revealed by the postmaster of Adharbayjan, who wrote to al-Mu'tasim and informed him about the money. Mankjur immediately wrote to the caliph in response, calling the accusation a lie, and the dispute between him and the postmaster quickly escalated. Mankjur eventually decided to kill the postmaster, but the latter sought refuge in Ardabil, prompting Mankjur to attack the city in retaliation.\n\nNews of these events reached al-Mu'tasim, who responded by ordering al-Afshin to send someone to dismiss Mankjur. Al-Afshin accordingly dispatched Abi'l-Saj Devdad to the province, but allegations began to circulate that al-Afshin was in fact secretly supporting Mankjur, and al-Mu'tasim decided to send Bugha al-Kabir to fight Mankjur instead. Mankjur now came out openly in rebellion, but was soon defeated on the field and forced to retreat. He then rebuilt a mountain fortress which had been destroyed by Babak and fortified himself in it, relying on the mountain's inaccessibility to defend him. Despite this, his rebellion came to an end less than a month later; varying accounts state that he was either betrayed by his men and handed over to the caliphal army, or that he received a guarantee of safe conduct from Bugha. In any case, he was brought back by Bugha to Samarra, where al-Mu'tasim ordered him to be thrown into prison.\n\nMankjur's rebellion proved damaging to the reputation of al-Afshin, who was suspected of secretly corresponding with Mankjur and encouraging him to revolt. This belief, combined with other accusations of treason against the caliph, ultimately resulted in al-Afshin being arrested in 840 for conspiring against the state, and led to his imprisonment and death in the following year.\n\n"}
{"id": "16511776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16511776", "title": "Megalesia", "text": "Megalesia\n\nThe Megalesia, Megalensia, or Megalenses Ludi, was a festival celebrated in Ancient Rome from April 4 to April 10, in honour of Cybele, known to Romans as \"Magna Mater\" (Great Mother). The name of the festival derives from Greek \"Megale\" (μϵγάλη), meaning \"Great\". \"Ludi\" were the games or entertainments associated with religious festivals.\n\nCybele's cult image was brought to Rome from Pessinus in 204 BC, along with the goddesses Galli priests. As the \"Great Mother of the Gods\" and a purported ancestral Trojan goddess of Rome's ruling patrician caste, she was recruited to act on Rome's behalf in the war against Carthage. Her arrival was solemnized with a magnificent procession, sacred feasts (\"lectisternia\"), games, and offerings to her at the temple of Victory on the Palatine Hill, where her image was temporarily housed.\nIn 203 Cybele was promised a temple of her own. Games in her honour were celebrated in 193. Regular annual celebration of the Megalesia began in 191, with the temple's completion and dedication by Marcus Junius Brutus\n\nThe \"Megalesia\" commenced on April 4, the anniversary of Cybele's arrival in Rome. The festival structure is unclear, but it included ludi scaenici (plays and other entertainments based on religious themes), probably performed on the deeply stepped approach to her temple; some of the plays were commissioned from well-known playwrights. On April 10, her image was taken in public procession to the Circus Maximus, and chariot races were held there in her honour. The racetrack could be seen from her temple's threshold, and a statue of Magna Mater was permanently sited on the racetrack's dividing barrier, showing the goddess seated on a lion's back: the goddess could thus watch the festivities held in her honour.\nRoman bystanders seem to have perceived Megalesia as either characteristically \"Greek\"; or Phrygian. At the cusp of Rome's transition to Empire, the Greek Dionysius of Halicarnassus describes this procession as wild Phrygian \"mummery\" and \"fabulous clap-trap\", in contrast to the Megalesian sacrifices and games, carried out in what he admires as a dignified \"traditional Roman\" manner; Dionysius also applauds the wisdom of Roman religious law, which forbids the participation of any Roman citizen in the procession, and in the goddess's mysteries; Slaves are forbidden to witness any of this. In the late republican era, Lucretius vividly describes the procession's armed \"war dancers\" in their three-plumed helmets, clashing their shields together, bronze on bronze, \"delighted by blood\"; yellow-robed, long-haired, perfumed Galli waving their knives, wild music of thrumming tympanons and shrill flutes. Along the route, rose petals are scattered, and clouds of incense arise. The goddess's image, wearing the Mural Crown and seated within a sculpted, lion-drawn chariot, is carried high on a bier. The Roman display of Cybele's Megalesia procession as an exotic, privileged public pageant offers signal contrast to what is known of the private, socially inclusive Phrygian-Greek mysteries on which it was based.\n\nDuring the festival, wealthy Roman nobles played host to each other, in rotation, in honour of the goddess; these were lavish, costly and competitive occasions in which the wealthy sought to impress their inferiors and peers; or in the latter case, to outdo them in extravagance. In direct response to this, the senate issued a decree in 161 BC, limiting expenditure on meat, wine and silverware for such feasts.\n\nIn the late republican era, Cicero attacked his political opponent Clodius for sacrilegious disruption of the \"casti, sollemnes, religiosi\" (pure, traditional, religious) rites of Megalesia. Clodius had sought popular support by defecting from a patrician to a plebeian gens. The Megalesia was a predominantly patrician affair; and in an apparent attempt to undermine patrician privilege, Clodius had hired slave-gangs to forcibly take control of the festival. The attempt was a failure, and Clodius was prosecuted for this and other outrages against Rome's traditional and social proprieties.\n\n"}

As the importance of the industrial heritage of Victoria and Australia has become more prominent, the Melbourne Steam Traction Engine Club (MSTEC) was established by volunteers to enable like-minded volunteers to preserve this part of our history. The Melbourne Steam Traction Engine Club was established in Melbourne over 45 years ago and is located at 1200 Ferntree Gully Rd Scoresby, Victoria, Australia. On site there is an extensive collection of Mobile Steam, Stationary Steam Engines, Stationary IC Engines, Diesel engines, Diesel Generator sets, Tractors and other mobile machinery.\n\nFormed in 1963 the MSTEC has been at its present 6½ hectare site in Scoresby, Victoria since 1986 when the land was leased from the Beamish Heavy Haulage at Wantirna. The site was originally a depot used for the tunnelling of the main trunk sewer and was a desolate waste land when the club took it over. Since occupation, the site as been developed with landscaping, tree planting, installation of the rail track, construction of the 9 sheds and toilet block and a man made lake.\n\nThe engines on display at the National Steam Centre represent many years of collection and restoration efforts by the members. In addition to the engines owned by the club, a number of members' privately owned engines are kept at the centre. A particular effort has gone in to ensure Australian steam and industrial heritage is preserved for Australians, in Australia, rather than allowing local heritage to be shipped overseas.\n\nMany of the engines on display are operated on the last Sunday of each month. This unique opportunity allows visitors to see many of the steam and diesel stationary engines running, including several steam Traction engines, steam rollers and tractors operating in the central arena. Rides aboard the miniature steam railway are a highlight! \n\nThe club's annual rally, known as the Scoresby Steamfest is held on the long week end in March each year when many of the beautifully restored MSTEC engines are exhibited and operated. Particular emphasis is placed on exhibiting engines as they were intended to be used, driving industrial or agricultural implements for example. Exhibits from many other associated clubs and historic machinery associations are also displayed and operated, as well as that from private collectors and enthusiasts. More recently, exhibits at the Scoresby Steamfest have grown to encompass many other hobbies and collections, including model and experimantal engineering and crafting, collections of antique engineering artifacts and tools, oil lamps, mechanical music, and other items from bygone eras.\n\nThe miniature railway operates every Sunday, weather permitting, from 11 am to 4 pm, except for the Christmas - New Year period. The track runs for about 1 km around the perimeter of the site. On the trip you pass the lake complete with numerous ducks and other water birds, you see the cattle grazing on the nearby farmland and you view some of the museum machinery around the track.\n\nThe line is only set up to run a single train at any one time. On the last Sunday of the month the train is pulled by a 4-4-2 steam locomotive. On other Sundays the diesel outline engine is used.\n\nThe grounds have shady trees, picnic tables and wood-fired barbecues for a picnic outing. There is no charge for admission to the grounds except for some special events like the annual rally.\n\n\n"}

Its slogan is \"The Great Minnesota Get-Together.\" It is the largest state fair in the United States by average daily attendance. It is also the second-largest state fair in the United States by total attendance, trailing only the State Fair of Texas, which generally runs twice as long as the Minnesota State Fair. The state fairgrounds, adjoining the Saint Paul campus of the University of Minnesota, are in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, midway between the state's capital city of St. Paul and its largest city, Minneapolis, near the Como Park and Saint Anthony Park neighborhoods of Saint Paul. Residents of the state and region come to the fair to be entertained, exhibit their best livestock, show off their abilities in a variety of fields including art and cooking, learn about new products and services, and eat many different types of food—often on a stick. The fair runs for twelve days from late August into early September, ending on Labor Day. The Minnesota State Fair was named the best state fair in the United States in 2015 by readers of USA Today.\n\nThe Minnesota State Fair is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the area. Around two million people attend the Fair annually. Attendance in 2018 was a record 2,046,533 people. The highest daily attendance in the history of the fair was 270,426 visitors on Saturday, September 1, 2018.\n\nMinnesota Territory first held a Territorial Fair in 1854, although the first Minnesota State Fair didn't occur until 1859, the year after statehood. Since then, the fair has run annually except for five different years. In 1861 and 1862, the fair was not held because of the Civil War and the Dakota War of 1862. Scheduling issues between the fair and the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois caused the 1893 show to be canceled. The fair again closed because of war in 1945, as fuel was in short supply. It was again closed in 1946 because of an outbreak of polio.\nIn its early years during the 19th century, the fair was held in many different locations. Some were not far from the current site, but others were held in Greater Minnesota, including years where it was held in Rochester, Owatonna, and Winona. For a time in the 1870s, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul held competing fairs. Minneapolis, the younger city of the pair, eventually outdid its neighbor by staging the larger fair with the help of William S. King.\nIn 1884, a committee was put together by the Minnesota State Agricultural Society to select a permanent site. One site that was considered was an area around Minnehaha Falls, but the final site chosen was the Ramsey County Poor Farm, the fair's current site. It was a politically neutral site, being about halfway between Minneapolis and St. Paul. The fair first opened its doors there on September 7, 1885. The site was then 210 acres (0.8 km²), but now stands at 322 acres (1.3 km²).\nOne of the first annual events to occur is the creation of a butter sculpture. Each year, a new Princess Kay of the Milky Way is selected to promote Minnesota's dairy industry. Part of the job involves posing for several hours in a walk-in, glass-walled refrigerator as a 90-pound (41 kg) block of butter is carved into a head with her likeness. Butter makers started sculpting their products at the fair as far back as 1898, although the head-sculpting tradition didn't begin until 1964.\n\nThe main entrance to the fair from Snelling Avenue heads onto a road named Dan Patch Avenue for a pacer horse who won every race he ran in from 1900 to 1909 when he was retired.\n\nOne of the most significant dates in the fair's history was September 2, 1901, when then-Vice President Theodore Roosevelt was visiting and first uttered the famous phrase, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick.\" Roosevelt became president just 12 days later after William McKinley was assassinated. In 1925, the Minnesota State Fair was the site of the Norse-American Centennial celebration. During his appearance at the Norse-American Centennial, President Calvin Coolidge gave recognition to the contributions of Scandinavian-Americans and noted Leif Erikson as the discoverer of America.\n\nIn 1967, attendance was well over a million people and the record day that year was about 197,000 visitors. By 2016, attendance neared 2 million and the record day was about a quarter-million people.\n2018 was another record year for the Fair. The overall attendance record of 2,046,533 was set along with an all-time single-day attendance record of 270,426 on the second Saturday. \n\nA large portion of the Fairgrounds are occupied by livestock barns, where various farm animals are displayed. The animals and their owners take part in livestock shows to compete for awards. Most of the shows take place in the coliseum, a large indoor arena on the fairgrounds. The Coliseum was constructed to replace the Hippodrome, which was rendered structurally unsound during its use as a Propeller Plant by the A.O. Smith Corporation during WWII and razed in 1946, and was completed for use in the 1951 fair. Open class livestock competitions are held in horses, beef cattle, dairy cattle, swine, sheep, dairy goats, llamas, poultry (chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, pigeons) rabbits, and stock dogs. On August 31, 2007, a bull escaped from its handler charging several fairgoers before fatally injuring itself charging a fire hydrant. No people were seriously injured in the mishap.\n\nOne of the primary attractions at the State Fair is the wide variety of foods to be had. Classic fair foods such as cotton candy and hot dogs are available. Some foods reflect Minnesota's agriculture, including cheese curds, milk shakes, and corn dogs. Many foods at the fair are deep fried or come on a stick; from the classic corn dog to alligator-on-a-stick, lobster-on-a-stick, and deep fried candy bar on a stick. New to the fair in 2006 was hotdish on a stick, a variant of a classic staple of Minnesotan cuisine. In 2007, one new food was spaghetti on a stick. 2008's new foods included two types of bacon, one called \"Pig Lickers\", which is chocolate covered, and the other, called the \"Big Fat Bacon\", a quarter pound of maple glazed bacon. Another staple of the state fair is “Sweet Martha’s Cookies” a stand that serves fresh and warm chocolate chip cookies in buckets. \n\nIn 2018, 27 new foods were introduced to the Minnesota State Fair including Firecracker Shrimp Stuffed Avocado, Honey Cream Soda Float, Mangonada Shaved Ice, Messy Giuseppe, Nordic Waffles, Smoked Soft Serve Ice Cream, and the UpNorth Puff Pastry.\n\nMachinery Hill is a large area of the fairgrounds. For several decades, it held the largest annual display of farm equipment in the world, with many companies showing off tractors, combines, and various attachments. However, modern displays generally focus on cars, trucks, lawn mowers, hot tubs and recreational machines like motorbikes. Farm implement dealers tend to direct their efforts to more targeted \"farm shows,\" abandoning the State Fair to more urban or suburban types of exhibitors. Machinery Hill also contains an interactive exhibit for kids called Little Farm Hands. In this exhibit, children get to experience life on the farm from planting seeds to selling goods at the farmers market. \n\nThe State Fair is host to numerous shows, including concerts, comedy shows, product demonstrations, and the State Fair Talent Contest. The Grandstand is a large outdoor concert hall that also features 3 floors of interior exhibition space. It hosts the largest of the fairs concerts and until 2002 was also the site of stock car races run on a small oval track. In 2003 the facility completed the first phase of a $35 million remodeling project that removed large sections of bleachers and increased seating capacity to 17,000. Most local television and radio stations set up temporary studios at the State Fair in their permanent buildings or booths, including for example a live broadcast of Garrison Keillor's \"A Prairie Home Companion\". As of 2013, the Grandstand hosts the Walker Art Center's Internet Cat Video Festival, in which fairgoers watch the year's most popular cat videos and memes and award the best videos with cat trophies, the most prized being the Golden Kitty. Guest appearances have included Grumpy Cat and Lil Bub, two internet stars, as well as the creator of Nyan Cat, Christopher Torres. The festival began in 2012.\n\nThe fair displays an annual art exhibition that is the result of a juried competition of works of fine art. Media include watercolor, oil, and acrylic paintings, photographs, sculptures, pastels, ceramics, glass, and textiles. Entrants must be living residents of the state. In 2010, a total of 2,330 pieces were submitted, and 413 works were accepted. Jeffery Gauss won the coveted People's Choice award with his \"MicroDoodle Topiary\", and \"Dog Park\" by Arden Harrison Bushnell won the Kid's Choice award.\n\nOne unusual display at the fair consists of the entrants in the Crop art competition. The artwork must be made of plant matter (seeds, stems, flowers, fruit, etc.) suitable for growing in Minnesota. For decades the display was dominated by Owatonna native Lillian Colton (1912–2007), who created seed portraits, professionally, having effectively captured scores of celebrities such as Ernest Hemingway, Barbra Streisand, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Prince, Princess Diana, and Willie Nelson in her crop art. After winning nine purple ribbons, she stopped competing, but continued displaying her work at the fair.\nCompetitions galore cover dozens of categories in needlecraft, garment-making, wood-working, models, painting, doll-making, taxidermy, stamp-collecting, scrapbooking, baking, food preservation, etc.\n\nThe annual 5 km run begins on the fairgrounds, winds its way through the Saint Paul campus of the University of Minnesota and the Saint Anthony Park neighborhood, and ends back at the fairgrounds.\n\n4-H has a significant presence at the fair, both in the 4-H Building and in the animal barns and arenas. Contests include herdsmanship, showmanship, judging teams, public presentations and county club exhibits. Livestock displays include beef and dairy cattle, dairy and market goats, poultry (chickens, ducks, geese, turkeys, and pigeons), rabbits, sheep, and swine. About half of all 4-H projects entered are animal science projects. The 4-H building was opened and dedicated in 1939 about 320,000 state fairgoers visit it every year. The non-livestock projects include photography, performing arts, crafts, food & nutrition, clothing & textiles, and many more.\n\nIn recent years the Progress Center has been housing the Eco Experience exhibit, which features activities and exhibits including the design and construction of an eco-friendly house, a rain garden, exhibits addressing climate change, energy conservation, renewable energy, biodiesel fuel and vehicles, and organic farming. The exhibit has received awards from the Western Fair Association, the International Associate of Fairs and Expositions, and the Minnesota Environmental Initiative.\n\nEvery year there are many musical venues. The most notable venue being the Grandstand which has a capacity of up to 17,000, and has featured headliners such as Alabama, Christina Aguilera, Backstreet Boys, Bob Dylan, Boston, Sheryl Crow, Foreigner, Aretha Franklin, Def Leppard, KISS, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Demi Lovato, Tim McGraw, Mötley Crüe, REO Speedwagon, Rush, Santana, Blake Shelton, Styx, James Taylor, Carrie Underwood, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, John Mellencamp, and Usher, featuring Lil'John (2017).\nThere are also many free entertainment venues featuring local bands and a selection of national acts. Entertainment stages include the Leinie Lodge Bandshell, the Schell's Stage at Schilling Amphitheater and the International Bazaar Stage, In 2010, Boyz II Men performed 2 nights at one of the free venues. Performers for the Leinie Lodge scheduled for 2015 include Lou Gramm \"The Voice Of Foreigner\", and several other national acts. The Cobras, a blues quartet, were slated to appear twice in 2016 at the French Creperie on Carnes Avenue.\n\nThere are several rides that are permanent fixtures at the fair, including the Giant Slide, on which fairgoers ride down a large fiberglass slide on burlap sacks. The Skyride is an aerial lift ride that carried fairgoers across the grounds in a gondola. The Space Tower is a gyro tower that rotates as it lifts people over 300 feet in the air, giving views of the Minneapolis/St. Paul area. There is also a haunted house, located on Judson Ave, a water raft ride, and log chute. The fair's oldest ride, Ye Old Mill (opened in 1915), is located near the food building. It is a tunnel of love style ride that caters to all ages.\n\nThe Midway is a carnival-like setting that contains most of the rides at the State Fair. The attractions include several funhouses, roller coasters and other thrill rides as well as numerous games of skill.\nAdventure Park is where the more extreme thrill rides are located. This includes the Ejection Seat and other rides like it. It is located across the street from the Midway, but is not a part of it. Adventure park also shares this block with a french fry stand.\n\nKidway is the carnival area on the fairgrounds geared toward children. Kidway is located between Dan Patch and Wright Avenues on the north end of the fairgrounds.\nThe Minnesota State Fair is considered a quasi-state agency, under the direction of the Minnesota State Agricultural Society. The management of the fair is handled by the Board of managers. The state fair has not accepted any governmental funds since 1949. Revenue from the fair is reinvested into maintenance and the next year's fair.\n\nThe Minnesota State Fair Foundation is an organization that works to improve and preserves historic state fair buildings. The foundation is a 501(c)3 organization, and also supports State Fair agricultural, scientific and educational programs. The foundation provided funding for the new Miracle of Birth center.\n\nThe Fair employs about 80 full-time staff members for the entire year; in the summer, some 400 seasonal staff are hired. During the fair-time, around 3,000 people are additionally hired.\n\nThe J.V. Bailey House, at 1263 Cosgrove Street, is one of the oldest buildings on the fairgrounds. It was built in 1911 and restoration was completed in 2006. It is connected to the greenhouses and was occupied year-round by the greenhouse superintendent until 2004. The State Fair Foundation operates out of the residence. The historic residence is open to Foundation donors and their family and friends during the fair.\n\nThe fair's mascots are two anthropomorphized gophers. The choice of gopher as mascots was an homage to the University of Minnesota mascot which is also a gopher and was a historical reference to the expansion of railroads in Minnesota, towns popping up across the state like gophers. For these reasons, Minnesota is sometimes referred to as the gopher state. Fairchild, the original mascot, was suggested in a statewide contest by Gladys Anderson Brown in 1966 in honor of Henry S. Fairchild who advocated using the former Ramsey County Poor Farm as the permanent site of the fair. Dressed like an early barker on the midway with a straw hat and striped jacket, Fairchild has represented the fair since 1966. In 1986, he was joined on promotional materials by his nephew, Fairborn.\n\nThe fairgrounds is heavily used for events beyond the Fair. These include many horse shows in the Coliseum & Horse Barn, the Minnesota Horse Expo and the Minnesota Beef Expo, dog shows, antique & hot-rod car shows, motorcycle shows, model railroad shows, clothing & jewellery shows, gun & weapon collectors shows, comic book conventions, flea markets & swap meets, and more. Buildings on the grounds are frequently rented for commercial events such as appliance sales, computer & electronics sales, and boat & car sales. Earlier in the summer, some of the fairground's roads are used to host an annual series of bike races during the week, called the State Fair Affair Criterium Series.\n\nIn addition, many of the buildings are rented for winter storage of boats, camping trailers, and similar equipment.\n\nRental fees for such off-season use of the fairgrounds is a major source of revenue for the State Fair, often surpassing the profits from the Fair itself.\n\nThe Coliseum was the home rink for many college and high school hockey teams. After 40 years and a few thousand games the facility saw its final game played in February, 2014.\n\n"}

While Desirèe was unconscious she was abused several times by different people. As reconstructed, she had taken drugs as early as the afternoon of October 18th, and died later on the night of 19 October. She was being abused while she was dying. This was shown by the investigations conducted by the police in Rome and by the San Lorenzo police station.\n\nOn 25 October two people were arrested for the murder: Mamadou Gara 26 and Brian Minteh 43 , both Senegal and living illegally in Italy. Both are accused, along other suspects, of group sexual violence, drug possession and voluntary homicide. The police are looking for at least two other men involved in the murder. The criminals were identified after a series of testimonies and findings made in the building where the body was found.\n\nLater, Alinno Chima, aged 40 from Nigeria was arrested.\n\nOn 26 October 2018 a fourth arrest was made, Yusif Salia from Gambia.\n\nNone of the arrested had legal documents to reside in Italy.\n\nMariottini was buried on Sunday 30 october in Cisterna di Latina in a ceremony attended by hundreds and mayor Raggi declared a day of mourning.\n\nOn October 24th 2018 interior minister Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-migration Northern League party, went to the abandoned building where the girl's body was found.\n\nActivists in the traditionally left-wing San Lorenzo district prevented Salvini from placing a rose outside the drug den where the victim was found and accused Salvini of exploiting her death. He returned later in the day unannounced and placed the flowers in front of the gate.\n\nThe tragedy of Desirée \"must be the last that happens in Italy and in Rome, an abandoned city, the degradation is evident, moral and social, more checks are needed in the city, more men and women of the police are needed, especially at night\".\n\nThe Rome Mayor Virginia Raggi decided to proclaim a day of mourning for the city in conjunction with the funeral of Desirée Mariottini. She also declared the intention of city authorities to have the building demolished. In a social media post, she stated that as a mayor, as a woman and the mayor of the city she could not tolerate the thought of this crime and called it an \"atrocious crime\".\n\nOn the evening of 25 October 2018, a spontaneous torch-light procession by the people of Rome San Lorenzo was organized to ask for \"justice for Desirée\".\n\nOn 27 October 2018, the citizens of Rome protest against the deterioration of the city, in which some areas such as Via Dei Lucani 22 are crumbling and abandoned to carelessness, and, above all, to criminals as drug dealers.\n\n"}

{"id": "2354070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2354070", "title": "Park Geun-hye", "text": "Park Geun-hye\n\nPark Geun-hye (; ; born 2 February 1952) is a former South Korean politician who served as the 18th President of South Korea from 2013 to 2017. Park was the first woman to be President of South Korea and also the first female president popularly elected as head of state in East Asia. She was also the first South Korean president to be born after the country's founding; her predecessors were either born during Japanese rule or during the post-World War II transitional period.\n\nPrior to her presidency, Park was chairwoman of the conservative Grand National Party (GNP) (which changed its name to Saenuri Party in February 2012) from 2004 to 2006 and 2011 to 2012. She was also a member of the National Assembly, serving four consecutive parliamentary terms between 1998 and 2012. She started her fifth term as a representative elected by national list in June 2012. Her father, Park Chung-hee, was the President of South Korea from 1963 to 1979, serving five consecutive terms after he seized power in 1961.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Park was ranked 11th on the \"Forbes\" list of the world's 100 most powerful women and the most powerful woman in East Asia. In 2014, she was ranked 46th on the \"Forbes\" list of the world's most powerful people, the third-highest South Korean on the list, after Lee Kun-hee and Lee Jae-yong.\n\nOn 9 December 2016, Park was impeached by the National Assembly on charges related to influence peddling by her top aide, Choi Soon-sil. Her presidential powers and duties were suspended with the ratification of the impeachment. Then–Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn thus assumed those powers and duties as Acting President. The impeachment was upheld by the Constitutional Court via a unanimous 8–0 ruling on 10 March 2017, thereby removing Park from office.\n\nOn 6 April 2018, Park was sentenced to 24 years in prison. Park is currently held under arrest at Seoul Detention Center.\nPark was born on 2 February 1952, in Samdeok-dong of Jung District, Daegu, as the first child of Park Chung-hee, the 3rd president of South Korea who served between 1963 and 1979, and Yuk Young-soo. She has a younger brother, Park Ji-man, and a younger sister, Park Geun-ryeong. She is unmarried with no children. Pew Research Center described her as an atheist with a Buddhist and Roman Catholic upbringing.\n\nIn addition to her native Korean, Park also speaks English, French, Spanish, and Mandarin with varying degrees of fluency.\n\nIn 1953, Park's family moved to Seoul and she graduated from Seoul's Jangchung Elementary School and Sungshim (literal: Sacred Heart) Girls' Middle and High School in 1970, going on to receive a bachelor's degree in electronic engineering from Sogang University in 1974. She briefly studied at Joseph Fourier University, but left France following the murder of her mother.\n\nPark's mother was killed on 15 August 1974 in the National Theater of Korea; Mun Se-gwang, a Japanese-born ethnic Korean sympathizer of North Korea and member of the Chongryon, was attempting to assassinate President Park Chung-hee. Park was regarded as First Lady until the assassination of her father by his own intelligence chief, Kim Jae-gyu, on 26 October 1979. During this time, activists who were political opponents of her father claimed to be subject to arbitrary detention. Further, human rights were considered subordinate to economic development. In 2007, Park expressed regret at the treatment of activists during this period.\n\nPark received honorary doctoral degrees from the Chinese Culture University in Taiwan in 1987, Pukyong National University and KAIST in 2008, Sogang University in 2010, and TU Dresden in 2014.\n\nPark was elected a Grand National Party (GNP) assemblywoman for Dalseong County, Daegu, in 1998 by-election, and three more times in the same electoral district between 1998 and 2008, being the incumbent assemblywoman till April 2012. In 2012, she announced that she would not run for a constituency representative seat for the 19th election in Dalseong or anywhere else, but for a proportional representative position for the Saenuri Party instead, in order to lead the party's election campaign. She was elected as a proportional representative in the April 2012 election.\n\nDue to the failed attempt to impeach President Roh Moo-hyun and the bribery scandal of its 2002 presidential candidate, Lee Hoi-chang (revealed in 2004), the GNP was facing a severe defeat in the 2004 general election. Park was appointed as the chairwoman of the party and led the election efforts. In the election, the GNP lost its majority position but managed to gain 121 seats, which is largely considered a great achievement under such inhospitable circumstances for the party. As the chairwoman of the GNP, Park helped her party make significant gains in local elections and actually obtain a majority in 2006.\n\nDuring the campaign, on 20 May 2006, Ji Chung-ho, a 50-year-old man with eight criminal convictions, slashed Park's face with a utility knife, causing an 11-centimeter wound that required 60 stitches and several hours of surgery. A famous anecdote from this incident occurred when Park was hospitalized after the attack. The first word that she said to her secretary after her recovery from her wound was \"How is Daejeon?\" After this, the candidate from the Grand National Party won the election for mayor of the city of Daejeon despite having trailed by more than 20 percentage points in opinion polls up to the point of the attack. In addition, during her term as the GNP chairwoman between 2004 and 2006, the party won all 40 reelections and by-elections held, which was largely credited to her influence and efforts. This feat gave Park a nickname \"Queen of Elections\".\n\nOn 12 February 2007, Park made a much-publicized visit to Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. Her visit culminated in an address to a packed audience at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, where she said she wanted to save Korea and advocated a stronger relationship between South Korea and the United States.\n\nPark hoped to emulate her father's success by becoming the presidential nominee of the Grand National Party. She eventually lost to Lee Myung-bak by a narrow margin. Lee had a commanding lead at the beginning of the primary season, but Park was able to narrow the gap through allegations of Lee's corruption. Park won the \"party members' bid\", but she lost the \"national bid\", which is a larger percentage of the total presidential bid.\n\nAfter the 2007 presidential election, President Lee Myung-bak formed a government of mostly close supporters. Park's supporters argued that this was a kind of political reprisal, and that they should secede from the Grand National Party. Eventually, they formed parties named Pro-Park Coalition and Solidarity for Pro-Park Independents (친박 무소속 연대; \"Chin Park Musosok Yeondae\"). Park herself did not join them, but indirectly supported them by announcing \"I hope these people will come back alive.\" After the mass secession, the rebels announced that they would rejoin GNP after the general election, but the GNP prohibited it. In the following 2008 general election, the rebels won 26 seats: 14 from the Pro-Park Coalition and 12 as independents. Together, they played a pivotal role in the GNP's narrow majority. Park continually insisted that GNP should allow the return of her supporters. As of 2011, most of these rebels had returned to the GNP, resulting in approximately 50 to 60 assembly members who support Park out of 171 in the GNP.\n\nAs a response to the dwindling approval rating of the GNP, the party formed an emergency committee and changed the name of the political party from the Grand National Party to the \"Saenuri\" Party, meaning \"New Frontier\" Party. On 19 December 2011, Park was appointed as the chairwoman of GNP's Emergency Committee, the de facto leader of the party.\n\nThe Saenuri Party achieved a surprise win against the opposing Democratic United Party in the 2012 General Election, winning 152 seats and retaining its majority position. Because of the corruption scandals of the Lee administration revealed before the election, the Saenuri Party was widely expected to win no more than 100 seats. During the 13-day campaign period, Park traveled about around South Korea, visiting more than 100 constituencies. It is the consensus of Korean news media and political experts that the most important factor leading to Saenuri Party's victory was Park's leadership. For this reason, the 2012 election was often dubbed the \"return of the Queen of Election\". Saenuri's defeat in the populous Seoul metropolitan area in this election, however, revealed the limitation of Park's political influence.\n\nPark had been the leading candidate for the 2012 presidential election in every national-level poll in South Korea between 2008, when the Lee Myung-bak administration began, and September 2011, with an approval rating of 25% to 45%, more than twice that of the second candidate. Park's approval rating was highest when the 2008 National Assembly election showed her strong influence and lowest in early 2010 as a result of her political stance against the Lee administration in Sejong City issue.\nIn September 2011, Ahn Cheol-soo, a former venture IT businessman and the Dean of Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology at Seoul National University, emerged as a strong independent candidate for the presidency. In national-level presidential polls in September 2011, Ahn and Park Geun Hye closely competed for the status of front-runner, with Park losing the top seat in some polls for the first time since 2008.\n\nAfter her victory in the 2012 General Election, Park's approval rating increased significantly. In a national-level survey by Mono Research on 30 August Park was the top presidential candidate with an approval rating of 45.5% when competing with all potential candidates, and according to another recent national survey result, had a higher approval rating (50.6%) than Ahn (43.9%) in a two-way competition with him as of 11 September.\nOn 10 July, Park formally announced her 2012 presidential bid at the Time Square, Yeongdeungpo District, Seoul. In this event she emphasized the right to pursue happiness, a democratic economy, and customized welfare services for the Korean people.\n\nThe opposing Democratic Party elected Moon Jae-in as its presidential candidate on 17 September, while Ahn Cheol-soo announced his presidential bid on 19 September. Although still a leading candidate, Park had a lower approval rating than both Ahn and Moon when engaged in two-way competition, according to a 22 September national survey. She was elected as the President of the Republic of Korea on 19 December 2012 with the approval of 51.6% of Korean voters.\n\nIn 2017, the NSI has admitted it conducted an illicit campaign to influence the South Korea's 2012 presidential election, mobilising teams of experts in psychological warfare to ensure that the conservative candidate, Park Geun-hye, beat her liberal rival Moon Jae-in.\n\nIn a 2012 survey by Korean Research assessing the political stance of 12 potential presidential candidates of South Korea, Park was considered the most conservative candidate.\n\nHer conservative, market-oriented political stance was well reflected in her campaign pledge for 2008 presidential bid to cut taxes, reduce regulation, and establish strong law and order. Since 2009, however, Park started to focus more on welfare issues, advocating customized welfare services to the South Korean people.\n\nPark is well known for her strict, no-compromise adherence to political promises. In 2010, for example, she successfully stopped the Lee administration's attempt to cancel the plan to establish Sejong City, a new national center of administration, arguing the plan was a promise made to people. This conflict between Park and Lee Administration cost her a considerable decrease in her approval rating at the time. In 2012, Park also vowed to construct a new airport in the southeastern region, a 2008 presidential campaign promise made by GNP but cancelled in 2011, despite claims of economic infeasibility of the plan.\n\nThe administrative vision of President Park Geun-hye's new government is \"a new era of hope and happiness\". The five Administrative Goals of the government are \"a jobs-centered creative economy\", \"tailored employment and welfare\", \"creativity-oriented education and cultural enrichment\", \"a safe and united society\" and \"strong security measures for sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula\". The Park Geun-hye administration plans to create a trustworthy, clean, and capable government through carrying out these goals, related strategies, and tasks.\n\nPark chose not to vote in the 2017 South Korean presidential election.\n\nPark became the 18th president of South Korea on 25 February 2013. At midnight, she took over all presidential authorities including the prerogative of supreme command of South Korea's armed forces from her predecessor Lee Myung-bak. In her inauguration speech at the National Assembly building, Park spoke of her plan to open a new era of hope through \"economic prosperity, people's happiness, and cultural enrichment\". She particularly expressed her hope that North Korea would give up its nuclear arms and walk on the path of peace and mutual development, and declared that the foundation for a happy era of unification in which all Korean people will be able to enjoy prosperity and freedom and realize their dreams would be built through the Korean Peninsula Trust-building Process. In her inauguration speech, Park presented four guiding principles to realize her administrative vision: economic prosperity, people's happiness, cultural enrichment, and establishment of foundation for peaceful unification. Park's inauguration ceremony was the largest one in South Korean history with 70,000 participants. Diplomatic representatives in Korea as well as high-level delegates specially sent from 24 countries around the world including Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, U.S. National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon, Taiwanese Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda also participated in the event to congratulate Park.\n\nThe goal of the newly launched Park Geun-hye Administration for governing state affairs is to open \"a new era of hope and happiness for all the people\". Park avowed that South Korea will break away from its long-pursued development model that centers around the nation, and shift the focus of government administration from the state to individual citizens. Through this process the structure of co-prosperity, in which the citizens become happy and as a result the nation develops, will be created. Park's administrative vision and basic principles for governing the nation are concretely outlined in her policy plans for the economy, society, welfare, diplomacy, and unification. The administration's keywords in managing state affairs are \"people\", \"happiness\", \"trust\", \"co-prosperity\" and \"principle\".\n\nRight after taking office, Park restructured the Blue House and government organization to carry out her administrative vision. The Office of National Security at the Blue House, Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning, and Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries were newly launched, and the seat of Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs was revived. The Chief of the National Security Office would act as a \"control tower\" for diplomatic, security, and national defense issues, and the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs for economic, social, and welfare issues.\n\nAfter taking office, Park met with John Kerry and U.S. President Barack Obama. Park's trip to the United States in May 2013 was her first foreign trip after taking office.\n\nLike many of her predecessors, Park has maintained a close relationship with the U.S., which has over 20,000 soldiers stationed in South Korea. During her visit to the U.S., she addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress, where she called for a united front against any North Korean provocations. Park also called for a strong global relationship between South Korea and the United States.\n\nPark assesses the security situation on the Korean Peninsula and emphasized that deterrence capabilities were the most important factor for security. Thus, Park considers the American-South Korean alliance as the most successful one in the world. And she hopes the American-South Korean relationship can be upgraded from a comprehensive strategic alliance to a global partnership.\n\nPark visited the United States on her first overseas trip as president. She traveled to Washington, D.C., New York City, and Los Angeles on 5–9 May 2013.\n\nDuring summit talks in May at the White House, Presidents Park and Obama adopted a joint declaration for the American-South Korean alliance and discussed ways to further develop the bilateral relations in a future-forward manner. Also, two leaders discussed ways to promote cooperation in building peace in the Northeast Asian region and strength the partnership between Seoul and Washington.\n\nThe two leaders of South Korea and the United States agreed to adopt a joint statement on comprehensive energy cooperation to build a foundation for a future growth engine and establish a policy cooperation committee on information and communication technology. In addition, President Park urged her U.S. counterpart to expand the annual U.S. visa quota for South Korean professionals in order to promote co-development of both economies.\n\nIn particular, the \"Joint declaration in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the Alliance between the Republic of Korea and the United States of America\" adopted by South Korea and the United States will become a meaningful document looking back at the past six decades of the alliance and spelling out a new direction for the development of bilateral relations over the coming decade.\n\nNorth Korea had engaged in provocations such as violating a UN Security Council resolution and firing a long-range missile on 12 December 2012, just before 19 December presidential election. After Park was elected, North Korea conducted its third nuclear test 12 February 2013, nullified the non-aggression agreements between the two countries on 8 March and withdrew North Korean workers from the Kaesong Industrial Complex on 8 April. Park maintained her stance that South Korea will not succumb to the North's provocations and threats, and will endeavor to elicit policy coordination towards North Korea with major powers such as the United States, China and the UN. Her response to North Korean issues gained the support of many South Koreans and also the United States, China, and Russia, and played a significant role in the unanimous adoption by the UN Security Council of Resolution 2094 regarding North Korea on 7 March 2013. Due to Park's response and the international community's actions, on 6 June North Korea ceased provocations and threats towards the South and suggested holding discussions on reopening the Kaesong Industrial Complex.\nPark said that peace and unification on the Korean peninsula is the wish of all 70 million Koreans and that as president she will do her utmost to meet such a goal. As well, \"the ultimate objective of reunification efforts is to improve the quality of life of people in both Koreas, to further expand freedom and human rights, and [from there] build a prosperous Korean Peninsula.\" She later stated, \"to open a new era of peace and hope on the peninsula, North Korea needs to accept her administration's trust building policy initiative\".\n\nPark's policy vision and initiative on issues concerning North Korea and unification are reflected in her Korean Peninsula Trust-building Process. The Ministry of Unification has announced a new vision statement \"realizing a new unified Korea that ensures everyone's happiness\". The administrative tasks for this cause include normalizing inter-Korean relations through a trust-building process, embarking on small-scale unification projects that will lead to a complete integration of the two Koreas, and taking practical measures to prepare for unification by strengthening unification capabilities. According to Park, peaceful unification will be achieved in a three-stage unification initiative: starting from securing peace, going through economic integration, and finally reaching political integration. To achieve sustainable peace by the initiative, the new administration will offer humanitarian assistance for the people in North Korea, inter-Korean exchange and cooperation in economic, social and cultural areas, and will apply 'Vision Korea project' for establishing a single economic community in the Korean Peninsula, conditioned on sufficient mutual trust and progress in denuclearizing North Korea.\n\nOn 27–30 June 2013, Park visited China with a South Korean delegation, where she met with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president. During the meetings, Park explained the government's stance on North Korea and gained his support.\n\nOn 13 November 2013, Park held an extended summit with President Vladimir Putin, whose visit to South Korea was the first among leaders of 4 major powers including the United States, China, and Japan. During the summit, Park and Putin had a comprehensive and productive dialogue with focus on improving economic relations such as logistics cooperation projects (through Russia and North Korea), expanding people-to-people exchanges, and strengthening political ties between South Korea and Russia. Park, especially, emphasized on making preparations to produce an outcome that corresponds to common interests by combining Korea's Eurasian Initiative and Russia's Asia-Pacific Policy. After the summit, both presidents issued a joint communique and held a joint press conference. Earlier, Park attended the G-20 Summit at St. Petersburg in September 2013, where she met Putin for a separate dialogue discussing economic cooperation and seeking support on North Korean issues. It marked the first Korea-Russia summit talk since Park's inauguration. When Park met with Russian Minister for the Development of Russian Far East Viktor Ishaev, who headed the Russian delegation to Park's inaugural ceremony, she stated that Russia is one of Korea's key strategic partners, and the successful launch of the Naro rocket is the outcome of mutually beneficial relations and demonstrates that relations will grow stronger in the future. She also noted that Russia's active participation in the six-party talks will contribute to alleviating tension on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nPark announced her plan to build a \"Creative Economy\" on 5 June 2013, representing her vision for economic revival and job creation.\n\nIn April, Park said \"Timing is very important for our economic policy, jobs and livelihood mainly ordinary people should organize a supplementary budget in a timely manner.\"\n\nOn 8 April 2014, Park signed the Australia–Korea Free Trade Agreement with Australia's Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\n\nPark has proposed as one item on the national agenda the eradication of \"Four Major Social Evils\" (사 대회악:\n\"sa dae hwe ak\") – sexual violence, domestic violence, school violence and unsafe food. Statistics show that sexual violence and domestic violence are increasing in these years. Without referring to statistical data, aggravating school violence or food safety is a public concern in South Korea. She also launched the National Unity Committee on 17 June with the purpose to advise the president in the process of resolving various conflicts in South Korean society and establishing a culture of co-existence and co-prosperity. Former Democratic United Party Advisor Han Kwang -ok was named as the head.\n\nOn 18 May 2013, President Park Geun-hye attended the 33rd anniversary of the Gwangju massacre, and gave voice to sorrow for the victims' family members.\n\nPark proposed three steps to North Korea to help move toward the reunification of the Korean Peninsula, on 28 March in Dresden during her state visit to Germany.\nAnd marking the Korean Peninsula's liberation from Japan's colonial rule Friday (8.15), President Park said, as anguish from the two Koreas' separation passes from one generation to the next, abnormalities on the divided peninsula have become the norm. The South Korean president then highlighted the urgent need to increase understanding and to help merge the lives of South and North Koreans for reunification. \"Starting with jointly managing rivers and forests running through the two Koreas, we need to expand joint projects that benefit both sides. In that respect, I hope North Korea will attend the UN Convention on Biological Diversity conference to be held in South Korean city of Pyeongchang in October.\"\nPresident Park Geun-hye has warned that a new nuclear test by North Korea could lead to, \"a nuclear domino effect\", that might provide its neighbors with a pretext to arm themselves with nuclear weapons, as she sat down with Wall Street Journal Managing Editor Gerard Baker in Seoul on 28 May.\n\nOn 18 May 2014, Park announced South Korea's \"plans to break up its coastguard\" after failing to respond well during the MV \"Sewol\" ferry disaster. According to Park, \"investigation and information roles would be transferred to the South Korea National Police while the rescue and salvage operation and ocean security roles would be transferred to the Department for National Safety, not to be confused with the Korean Ministry of Security and Public Administration, which will be newly established\".\nOn 19 November 2014, the Korea Coast Guard and National Emergency Management Agency ceased control as the Ministry of Public Safety and Security was founded at the same day.\n\nOn 26 May 2015, Park urged the head of the Asian Development Bank to cooperate with South Korea and the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank after South Korea had officially applied to join the Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in late March 2015.\n\nOn 1 May 2016, Park became the first South Korean president to visit Iran. She was at the head of a 236-member delegation of businessmen and entrepreneurs during a three-day visit to Tehran to discuss bilateral trade and other matters of mutual interest. She met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and held talks with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. The two countries also signed 19 basic agreements to expand mutual cooperation over a variety of areas. Earlier, Iran's President Rouhani emphasized that Iran and South Korea are set to boost their trade volume from the current $6 billion to $18 billion.\n\nPark suffered a serious setback in the 2016 general elections on 13 April 2016, as the Saenuri Party lost both its majority and its status as first party in the National Assembly. Park had been criticized for her involvement in the elections and the party's nomination process, and other Saenuri members blamed the pro-Park faction in the party for the defeat. Park loyalists fared badly in constituency elections. The result was seen to hinder the chances of Park's passing her proposed economic reforms, and in the aftermath of the results the conservative \"The Chosun Ilbo\" stated that Park's \"lame duck period has started earlier than any other administration in the past\".\n\nIn July 2013, public support for Park's method of governing state affairs reached up to 63 percent, much higher than the percentage of the votes she had won in the presidential election, which is 52 percent. The Korean media explained that such a high level of support comes from Park's principled North Korea policy, constructive outcome from visits to the United States and China, and distancing away from internal political disputes.\n\nBy January 2015, Park's approval rating had fallen to 30 percent, partly due to the sinking of MV \"Sewol\" and disputes with North Korea. By September 2015, Park's approval had increased to 54 percent due to her diplomacy that defused a military standoff with North Korea, but in the aftermath of her party's 2016 election loss, her ratings fell back to 31.5 percent, plunging 8.1 percentage points compared to the week before the election.\n\nOn 4 November 2016, Park's ratings fell to 4–5% as details of her relationship with Choi Soon-sil were investigated and exposed in what became the 2016 South Korean political scandal.\n\nPark was arrested on 31 March 2017, and held in pre-trial detention at the Seoul Detention Center in Uiwang, Gyeonggi Province. On 17 April 2017, Park was formally charged with abuse of power, bribery, coercion, and leaking government secrets. Park denied the charges during five rounds of interrogation while in jail.\n\nProsecutors sought a 30-year jail term for Park, along with a fine of ().\n\nOn 6 April 2018, a three-judge panel of the Central District Court in Seoul sentenced Park to 24 years in prison and a fine of (), finding her guilty of 16 out of 18 charges brought before her.\n\nIn June 2018 three former NIS directors (Lee Byung-kee, Lee Byung-ho, and Nam Jae-joon) who served in the Park administration were found guilty of bribing, related to the 2016 Park Geun-hye scandals. They illegally transferred money from the NIS budget to Park's presidential office. This illegally obtained money was used by Park and her associates for private use and to pay bribes.\n\nPark had been often criticized for being the \"daughter of a dictator (Park Chung-hee)\" and for not actively supporting the Lee administration by supporters of Lee Myung-bak. A national-level poll conducted in July 2012 by a conservative newspaper reported that 59% of participants responded they did not believe Park was a \"daughter of a dictator\" while 36% agreed with the characterization. Park Chung-Hee's status as a dictator became a contested topic after the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. GNP party elites saw this as their chance to revitalize Park Chung-Hee's image, focusing on South Korea's economic growth during his administration, thus steadily changing his public perception. \n\nDuring a recent interview with the Cheongju broadcast station \"CJB\", Park commented regarding her stance that her father's May 16 coup was a \"revolution to save the country\" by stating, \"I don't think it's the place of politicians to be fighting over whether [the events of 1961] were a 'coup d'etat' or a 'revolution'.\" In a July 2012 survey, 50% of respondents answered that they disagreed with Park's assessment that her father's 1961 coup was \"unavoidable, the best possible choice, and an advisable decision\", as opposed to 37% that agreed. From another survey conducted in July 2012, 42% of respondents agreed with her opinion that her father's 1961 coup was \"unavoidable\", while 46% disagreed.\n\nBecause Park inherited strong regional and generational support from her father, as well as the legacy of his economic success, Park's opponents used her father as criticism against her.\n\nPark has faced much scrutiny over an educational foundation, Jeongsoo Scholarship Foundation, formerly known as Buil (in reference to the stock it controls in the newspaper \"Busan Ilbo\"), which her father, and later she, headed. Its original owners claimed in court they were forced to turn it over to her father.\n\nA Saenuri Party assemblyman Nam Kyung-pil criticized the Park-centered nature of the party, regarding its preparation for the 2012 presidential election, and stated, \"If we keep seeing the same situation where Park Geun-hye gives a press conference before a general meeting of lawmakers is held, and what she says then gets decided on as the party's position, then the public is going to think democracy has disappeared from the party.\"\n\nFurthermore, some have said Park's behavior in the lead-up to 2012 presidential election was a mixture of trend-following and corner-cutting—a stark contrast with the vehement insistence on principle that she showed when she opposed a revision of the plan for a multifunctional administrative city in Sejong City. For instance, Yim Tae-hee, another presidential candidate of the party, pointed to Park's voting down of a motion to arrest Chung Doo-un, a lawmaker implicated with bribery related to saving banks. Another candidate, Ahn Sang-soo, accused Park of \"saying one thing yesterday and another today\".\n\nPark fired Yoon Chang-jung, a Blue House spokesman who was alleged by Washington police to have committed sexual assault against a young woman hired as an intern at the South Korean Embassy in Washington during President Park's first visit to the United States.\nPark has been criticized for picking the wrong people for senior government posts.\n\nJust a week before the presidential election date, the opposing party alleged that the public servants from National Intelligence Service (NIS) have organized to promote Park's election campaign by way of posting online articles favorable to Park and slanderous to the opposing candidates. This political behavior by public servants is strictly prohibited by Korean Constitution.\nTo prove their allegation, the opposing Democratic Party, along with the police and Central Election Assistance Commission, swooped in the house where the alleged agent of NIS has resided. From there, the 29-year-old female agent, later known as Ha-Young Kim, who was running an illegal online election campaign operation such as spreading slanderous postings about the opposing candidate had locked herself in. The police could not force to enter the house and the standoff lasted for three days, provoking a tense political standoff. The opposition accused the intelligence service of blocking an investigation. Park and her party accused the opposition of harassing the woman. Park even said the standoff of the self-lock-in was a violation of a female right in the presidential candidate debate that took place three days before the election.\n\nLater that night of the presidential debate, Kim Yong-pan, then the chief of Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, publicly announced there was no evidence of illegal online postings from the collected laptop of the female agent. This announcement, which took place three days before the election, was believed to have significantly affected the outcome of the presidential election according to the opposing party.\nAfter months of probes into the alleged election meddling, the prosecution concluded in mid-June 2013 that Won Sei-hoon, then NIS chief who headed the intelligence agency for around four years under former President Lee Myung-bak, ordered agents to conduct online smear campaign against opposition presidential candidates. The special investigation drew a conclusion that the agents systemically intervened in domestic politics by writing thousands of postings on politics in cyberspace through hundreds of different user IDs. Kim Yong-pan, then chief of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency (SMPA), was prosecuted without physical detention on charges of abusing his authority to hamper police investigation into the case. CCTV conversation between the computer analysts who were analyzing the laptop at police revealed that the police already knew there were illegal online postings against the opposing party's candidates, but the chief of SMPA publicly announced otherwise, an announcement that indicates intentional meddling into the presidential election.\n\nThe investigation and the trial at court are on-going, and Park faces a political blow. However, the leading Saenuri party along with government leaders has attempted to dodge its political fall-out. Their effort has involved tipping a rumor to a major conservative media, Chosun Ilbo, about an extramarital child of the Chae Dong-wook, former Prosecutor General, who has approved the prosecution of Won Se-hoon and Kim Yong-pan, which eventually led to his resignation. Yoon Suk-ryul, the director of the special investigation team, which was leading the probe into the election meddling, was fired and returned to his original position, head of Yeoju branch Supreme Prosecutors Office. The investigation of his team has further revealed that the NIS is suspected of having posted 55,689 messages on Twitter for three months until the presidential election.\n\nWhether or not the election meddling of the NIS by way of online posts has actually affected the outcome of the presidential election is controversial. However, the false announcement by Kim Yong-pan, then chief of the SMPA, has appeared to do so. Had the police announced honestly, 14% of the electorate who voted for Park said they would have voted for Moon Jae-In, the first runner-up of the election.\n\nPark has been criticized for holding press conferences with questions and answers submitted in advance. As of 11 January 2015, she held press conferences four times since she took office in February 2013. Among the four press conferences, three of them were public speeches without questions and answers. Even in the remaining press conference, the questions were submitted in advance and she read prepared answers. Her opponents labeled her as \"No communication\" (불통, \"Bultong\").\n\nOn 15 November 2015, around 80,000 anti-government protesters clashed with government forces on the streets of Seoul, demanding that Park step down, with many of the protesters chanting \"Park Geun-hye, step down\". The rally was triggered by Park's adopting business-friendly labour policies and a decision to require middle and high schools to use only state-issued history textbooks in classes starting in 2017, combined with plans to make labour markets more flexible by giving employers more leeway in dismissing workers. Security forces fired tear gas and sprayed water cannons into the crowd when protesters attempted to break through police barricades.\n\nIn the wake of the April 2014 capsize of the Sewol ferry, public outcry arose over the government's handling of the situation. In response, the Park administration established a commission to monitor and prosecute social media critics of Park.\nTatsuya Kato, Japanese journalist who was a Seoul Bureau chief of South Korea at \"Sankei Shimbun\" was indicted on charges of defamation for reporting the relationship of President Park Geun-hye and Choi Soon-sil's husband, Chung Yoon-hoi, by the Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea after the MV \"Sewol\" sank.\n\nOn 25 June 2015 Park said that \"Betrayal which breaks the trust shouldn't be accepted in politics and this should be punished by election with people's own hands\". This mention was aimed to Yu Seungmin who was a member of Saenuri Party. Her mention was criticized by professor Jo Guk and politician Moon Jae-in because it had a purpose of losing Yu Seungmin's election which is protected by Public Official Election Act. But the National Election Commission decided not to treat Park's mention as a violation of Public Official Election Act.\n\nIn late October 2016, investigations into Park's relationship with Choi Soon-sil, daughter of the late Church of Eternal Life cult leader and President Park's mentor Choi Tae-min began.\n\nSeveral news media including JTBC and the Hankyoreh reported that Choi, who has no official government position, had access to confidential documents and information for the president, and acted as a close confidant for the president. Choi and President Park's senior staff including both Ahn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung used their influence to extort ₩77.4 billion (approximately $75 million) from Korean chaebols—family-owned large business conglomerates—and set up two culture and sports-related foundations, Mir and K-sports foundations. Choi is also accused of having influenced Ewha Womans University to change their admission criteria in order for her daughter Chung Yoo-ra to be given a place there.\n\nAhn Jong-bum and Jeong Ho-sung, top presidential aides, were arrested for abuse of power and helping Choi; they denied wrongdoing and claimed that they were simply following President Park's orders.\n\nOn 25 October 2016, Park publicly acknowledged her close ties with Choi. On 28 October, Park dismissed key members of her top office staff while her approval ratings fell to 4%. Her approval rating ranged from 1 to 3% for Korean citizens under 60 years of age, while it remained higher, at 13%, for the over 60 age group. It was the worst ever approval rate in Korean history and is worse than the 6% approval rating of former President Kim Young-sam, who was widely blamed for forcing the Korean economy into the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The controversy led to mass protests and rallies in October and November 2016 calling for her resignation. On 12 November, more than 1 million citizens participated in the protests at Gwanghwamun Square close to presidential residence demanding President Park's resignation or impeachment. On 19 November, another 1 million people participated in the national protest after Park refused to help in the investigation.\nPark then fired a number of her cabinet members and the prime minister. In particular, the sacking of the prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn resulted in a controversy, due to the claim that his firing was carried out via a text message.\n\nThe Supreme Prosecutors' Office of Korea (SPO), in laying charges against Choi and two former presidential aides, have alleged that President Park colluded with the three in certain criminal activities. The president would be questioned by prosecutors, the first time this has occurred with a serving South Korean president.\n\nFollowing the scandal, there were a series of massive demonstrations that started in the first week of November 2016.\n\nOn 29 November 2016, Park offered to resign as President, and invited the National Assembly to arrange a transfer of power. The opposition parties rejected the offer, accusing Park of attempting to avoid the process of impeachment.\n\nThe National Assembly instead filed a motion for impeachment, which was put to a vote on 9 December 2016 and passed with 234 supports. Due to the ratification of her impeachment proposal, her presidential powers and duties were suspended, and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn assumed those powers and duties as Acting President.\nPark was finally ousted from office by the Constitutional Court on 10 March 2017. The decision was unanimous, 8–0 in favour of impeachment, as announced shortly thereafter. On 26 March 2017, South Korean prosecutors announced they were seeking an arrest warrant against Park. This warrant was granted by the Seoul Central District Court on 30 March 2017 and Park was arrested later that day.\n\n\n\n"}

In Japan, a disaster relief organization was created under the name \"Relief 2.0\".\n\nFollowing the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, a group of fellows, academics, technology experts and emergency response volunteers organized a Relief 2.0 workshop at Stanford University in February 2010 to collect and organize the lessons learned in the field in Haiti. These lessons were further researched and worked on at the National University of Singapore Entrepreneurship Centre in collaboration with the Stanford University Peace Innovation Laboratory and later tested in the field in the Tōhoku Region of Japan after the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami of 2011. The findings were presented at Kyushu University in Fukuoka, Japan in April 2010 during the TEDxEarthquake9.0 conference.\n\nIn April 2011, the report \"Disaster Relief 2.0: The Future of Humanitarian Information Sharing\" report was presented at the US Mission to the UN in New York. It was prepared by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, in cooperation with the United Nations Foundation, Vodafone Foundation and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA). This report highlighted the role of mass participation using mobile communications, social media and crisis mapping to pinpoint the most urgent needs following a disaster.\n\nThere are a number of tools, toolkits and specific platforms available and used in the practice of Relief 2.0, including Ushahidi Crowdmap, Frontline SMS, OpenStreetMaps, Sahana FOSS Disaster Management System and Crisis Maps.\n\nSeveral private, government funded and non-profit groups have emerged in recent years to advance the practice of Relief 2.0, increase preparedness and the effectiveness of disaster response at a local and a global level.

{"id": "36332980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36332980", "title": "Syria Files", "text": "Syria Files\n\nOn 5 July 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing what it called the Syria Files, a collection of more than two million emails from Syrian political figures and ministries and from companies including Finmeccanica and Brown Lloyd James dating from August 2006 to March 2012.\n\nThe release of the files started on 5 July 2012. The database comprises 2,434,899 emails from 680 domains. At least 400,000 files are in Arabic and 68,000 files in Russian. Media organisations working with WikiLeaks on the release include the Lebanese daily \"Al Akhbar\", the Egyptian daily \"Al-Masry Al-Youm\", the Italian weekly \"L'espresso\", the German public radio and television broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) of the ARD consortium, the French information website and the Spanish website Público. The New York City based multinational news agency Associated Press (AP) was initially announced by WikiLeaks to be helping with the release. The claim was withdrawn by WikiLeaks and an AP spokesperson stated that AP was \"reviewing the emails for possible coverage [and] did not have any advance agreement on how [it] might handle the material.\" According to \"Al Akhbar\"s analysis, the Syria Files \"illuminate—often in small ways—the nature of power within and the inner workings of certain political and economic elements in Syria\". \"Al Akhbar\" states its confidence that \"the emails are authentic, that the senders and receivers are mainly who they say they are\".\n\nA hacktivist group of the Anonymous collective claimed credit for obtaining the emails and providing them to WikiLeaks. Anonymous stated that it had \"worked day and night\" in order to access computer servers in Syria and that \"the data available had been so massive that downloading it had taken several weeks.\" Anonymous gave the data to WikiLeaks because it judged WikiLeaks to be \"supremely well equipped to handle a disclosure of this magnitude\". Anonymous stated that as long as Bashar al-Assad remains in power, it will continue \"to assist the courageous freedom fighters and activists in Syria\".\n\nAccording to emails published by WikiLeaks on 5 July 2012, the Italian conglomerate Finmeccanica increased its sale of mobile communications equipment to Syrian authorities during 2011, delivering 500 of these to the Damascus suburb Muadamia in May 2011, after the Syrian Civil War had started, and sending engineers to Damascus in February 2012 to provide training in using the communications equipment in helicopter terminals, while the conflict continued.\n\nIn May 2011, the public relations firm Brown Lloyd James sent an email to Syrian authorities \"on how to create the appearance it is pursuing reform while repressing the uprising\", in Ynetnews' description of an email published by WikiLeaks on 6 July. Brown Lloyd James advised that \"Refocusing the perception of outsiders and Syrians on reform will provide political cover to the generally sympathetic US Government, and will delegitimize critics at home and abroad. In our view, the President needs to communicate more often and with more finely-tuned messaging and the First Lady needs to get in the game. The absence of a public figure as popular, capable, and attuned to the hopes of the people as Her Excellency at such a critical moment is conspicuous. The key is to show strength and sympathy at once.\" The company recommended a public relations campaign to \"create a reform 'echo-chamber' by developing media coverage outside of Syria that points to the President's difficult task of wanting reform\" so that the \"coverage [would] rebound into Syria\". Brown Lloyd James also recommended \"countering ... the daily torrent of criticism and lies\" by \"[a] 24-hour media monitoring and response system [that] should be in place with assets in UK and US markets; [monitoring] social media sites and [challenging and removing] false sites; and a steady, constantly updated messaging document that contains talking points geared to latest developments.\"\n\nBrown Lloyd James stated that the document was not paid for, was a \"'last-ditch' effort 'to encourage a peaceful outcome rather than violence', and that it was sent to Asma al-Assad, the wife of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nOn 8 July 2012, \"Al Akhbar\" presented an analysis of emails by President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma al-Assad. \"Al Akhbar\" listed the main topics of the al-Assad's Syria Files emails, and stated, \"Viewed through the prism of the 'Syria Files', Syria’s first couple appear to be occupied with their representative capacities, with ample time devoted to the state of the palatial gardens, renovations, the stationary needs of low-level employees, but also issues related to bolstering the couple’s image, be it via charitable efforts or through political favors. During the first year of the uprising covered by the emails in the cache, the official and unofficial correspondence of the First Couple and ministry of presidential affairs present only few references to the ongoing tumult ... But there is no real sense of tangible power on behalf of the First Couple present within the 'Syria Files.' What is revealed is only a façade, or perhaps fittingly, a brand calculated to cloak another system: the military-security machine, which remains as of yet tightly in control and far from prying eyes.\"\n\nSyria Files examined by \"Al Akhbar\" show that after businessman Rami Makhlouf publicly claimed to respond to protestors' demands by \"repenting\" from business, selling shares and investing his money and time in charity and development projects, he continued to invest in several banks during 2011 and 2012. In late January 2012, he bought about 15 times as much shares (by value) as he sold, buying and selling of shares, mostly in Qatar National Bank–Syria and Syria International Islamic Bank.\n\nWikiLeaks leader Julian Assange said of the files that \"it helps us not merely to criticise one group or another, but to understand their interests, actions and thoughts. It is only through understanding this conflict that we can hope to resolve it.\"\n\nOn September 9, 2016, reporters from \"The Daily Dot\" broke a story describing unsealed U.S. court documents showing that the leaked version of the Syria Files omitted records of a €2 billion transfer from the Central Bank of Syria to the Russian government-owned VTB Bank.\n\n"}

Alternative names used to refer to the incident include the Xilai Temple Incident after the Xilai Temple in Tainan, where the revolt began, and the Yu Qingfang Incident after the leader Yu Qingfang.\n\nMultiple Japanese police stations were stormed by Aboriginal and Han Chinese fighters under Chiang Ting (Jiang Ding) and Yü Ch'ing-fang (Yu Qingfang).\n\nModern Taiwanese historiography attempts to portray the Tapani Incident as a nationalist uprising either from a Chinese (unification) or Taiwanese (independence) perspective. Japanese colonial historiography attempted to portray the incident as a large scale instance of banditry led by criminal elements. However, the Tapani Incident differs from other uprisings in Taiwan's history because of its elements of millenarianism and folk religion, which enabled Yu Qingfang to raise a significant armed force whose members believed themselves to be invulnerable to modern weaponry.\n\nThe similarities between the rhetoric of the leaders of the Tapani uprising and the Righteous Harmony Society of the recent Boxer Rebellion in China were not lost on Japanese colonial authorities, and the colonial government subsequently paid more attention to popular religion and took steps to improve colonial administration in southern Taiwan.\n\nThe aboriginals carried on with violent armed struggle against the Japanese while Han Chinese violent opposition stopped after Tapani.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21735005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21735005", "title": "Timeline of the Great Depression", "text": "Timeline of the Great Depression\n\nThe initial economic collapse which resulted in the Great Depression can be divided into two parts: 1929 to mid-1931, and then mid-1931 to 1933. The initial decline lasted from mid-1929 to mid-1931. During this time, most people believed that the decline was merely a bad recession, worse than the recessions that occurred in 1923 and 1927, but not as bad as the Depression of 1920-21. Economic forecasters throughout 1930 cheerily predicted an economic rebound come 1931, and felt vindicated by a stock market rally in the spring of 1930. \n\nThe stock market crash in the first few weeks had a limited direct effect on the broader economy, as only 16% of the U.S. population was invested in the market in any form. But thousands of investors and banks lost money when 10% of invested wealth was lost almost overnight, with prospect of further losses. The crash created uncertainty in people’s minds about the future of the economy. This distrust in future income reduced consumption expenditure. As demand for commodities decreased, so did their prices. However, many banks that had engaged in risky investments in the stock market, and/or had lent money to individuals engaged in trading, suffered balance sheet losses that reduced their capital ratios. Mounting losses from further stock market declines and a worsening macroeconomy would further strain the banking system. Over $34 million in wealth would be lost from the collapses in leverage investment products in 1929 offered by Goldman Sachs alone.\n\nAn increasing number of bank failures in late-1930 interrupted the process of credit creation and reduced the money supply, harming consumption. After a second round of banking panics in mid-1931, there was a major change in people’s expectations about the future of the economy. This fear of reduced future income coupled with the Fed’s deflationary monetary policy resulted in a deflationary spiral that cratered consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production. This further depressed the economy until Roosevelt stepped into office in 1933 and ended the gold standard, thereby ending the deflationary policy.\n\nA true understanding of the Great Depression requires not only knowledge of the U.S. monetary system but also the implications of the gold standard on its participatory nations. The gold standard made the involved nations interdependent on each other's policies. Due to a fixed exchange rate, the only way to affect the demand for gold was through interest rates. For example, if interest rates were high in one country, then investors would have no reason to exchange currency for gold and the gold reserves would remain stable. However, if interest rates were low in a different country then its investors would elect to move their funds abroad where interest rates were higher. In order to stop this from happening, each nation within the gold standard union had no choice but to raise its interest rates in correspondence with its fellow nation. This interconnectivity of deflationary policy amongst so many nations resulted in the prolongation of the greatest economic downturn.\n\nJanuary - June: the Roaring Twenties continue unabated. The combined net profits of 536 manufacturing and trading companies showed a 36.6% increase over the same period in 1928, with steel production leading the way. Retail sales, construction starts, and railroad revenues set record after record. Stocks continue to make record gains. An enormous surplus of wheat from 1928 drives down wheat prices, straining commodity markets and farmers' incomes. Unemployment hovers around a robust 4%. US nominal GDP is $105 billion (it would not reach this level again until 1941).\n\nMarch 25th: a mini-stock market crash occurs after the Federal Reserve warns of excessive speculation. However, the mini-crash was averted two days later when National City Bank pumped $25 million in credit into the stock market.\n\nSummer: consumer spending and industrial production begin to stagnate. The Federal Reserve continues with its plan to raise interest rates from 4% in mid-1928 to 6% by mid-1929 in an attempt to combat speculative behavior. \n\nJune 15th: the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929 is signed into law, providing some $100 million in emergency loans to struggling farmers\n\nMay-September: the stock market makes almost entirely uninterrupted gains, gaining 20% over this period. \n\nAugust: a minor recession begins, two months before the Stock Market Crash. Steel production and automobile & house sales notably decline, construction stagnates, and consumer debt was reaching dangerous levels on account of easy credit. Over $8.5 billion of margin loans for stocks were outstanding, worth more than all currency circulating in the United States at the time. \n\nSeptember 3rd: Dow Jones peaks at 381.17. The stock market would not regain this peak until November 23rd, 1954. \n\nSeptember 20th: The London Stock Exchange crashes after the collapse of Hatry Group on charges of fraud and forgery. £24 million in value is wiped out. The collapse shakes the confidence of American investors in the security of overseas investments. \n\nOctober 24th: Wall Street Crash of 1929 begins. Stocks lose over 11% of their value upon the opening bell.\n\nOctober 25th - 27th: Brief recovery on the market.\n\nOctober 29th: 'Black Tuesday'. U.S. Stock market collapse, the DOW Jones closing down over 12%. \n\nOctober 30th: one day recovery\n\nNovember 1st: The Federal Reserve begins lowering the discount rate from its 6% level.\n\nNovember 13th: stock market bottoms out at 198.60, followed by a bear market that would last until April 1930. Commodity prices, however, continue to decline steeply.\n\nYear: recession deepens. US GDP contracts by 8.5% and nominal GDP falls to $92 billion. Prices decline slightly but wages hold relatively steady. US annual inflation rate is -6.4%. Unemployment reaches 9%. 1,350 banks fail. \n\nApril 17th: Dow reaches a secondary closing peak (i.e., bear market rally) of 294.07, followed by a long stagnation until a severe decline began in April 1931. This peak matches early-1929 levels, but is 30% below the September 1929 peak. \n\nMay: Automobile sales fall below 1928 levels.\n\nJune 17th: Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act passed, placing more stress on the weakening global economy, primarily through the collapse in trade of agricultural products, which strained banks that had lent heavily to farmers. Further decreases in trade of manufactured products led to layoffs and reduced corporate profits, weakening the economy. General consensus among economists is that the Smoot-Hawley Act did not cause the Depression, but did worsen it and stunted recovery efforts after 1933. Exports declined from $5.2 billion in 1929 to just $1.7 billion in 1933. \n\nSeptember - December:' First major round of U.S. bank failures. Some $550 million in deposits are lost. Over 300 banks failed in December alone.\n\nNovember: Caldwell & Company, a major conglomerate offering banking, insurance, and brokerage services in the Southern United States, collapses and triggered a cascading effect of bank runs on smaller banks in Tennessee and Kentucky. The collapse generates national headlines, contributing to the contagion of fear regarding the banking system. \n\nDecember: The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate reaches 2%, a then-record low. \n\nDecember: Bank of United States (a private bank in New York City) collapses. The bank had over $160 million in deposits and was the fourth largest bank in the United States at the time, and its failure is widely considered to be the moment when the banking collapse in the United States hit a critical mass, sparking a nationwide run on the banking system that was a major contributor to the deflationary spiral of 1931-1933. \n\nYear: 2,294 banks went down with nearly $1.7 billion in deposits. 28,285 businesses failed for a daily rate of 133 failures in 1931. Unemployment rises to 16%. US nominal GDP falls to $77 billion, and growth is -8.5%. Annual inflation is -9.3%.\n\nMay 11th: Creditanstalt, Austria's premier bank with major stakes across a variety of industries, becomes insolvent after being forced to assume liabilities from three other insolvent banks, triggering a cascading effect of bank failures across Central Europe. Creditanstalt represented 16% of Austria's GDP, and could not find another institution to guarantee liquidity. 140 million Austrian Schillings were lost. The collapse of Creditanstalt caused the Bank of France, the National Bank of Belgium, the Netherlands Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to begin a run on the U.S. Dollar for their gold reserves, and forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates from 1.5% to 3.5% to maintain the gold standards, which in turn contributed to the deepening of the Depression and the second round of banking failures in the U.S. during the summer of 1931. \n\nMay: The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate bottoms out at 1.5%.\n\nMay–June: Second major round of U.S. bank failures and worsening economic situation contributes to permanent change in people's expectation of the economy. This run was centered on bank in Chicago, which suffered from real estate loan defaults. Of the 193 state-chartered banks in the Chicago area in 1929, only 35 would survive to the end of 1933. Chicago area banks engaged heavily in real estate lending between 1923 and 1929, and banks that had greater exposure to the real estate bust were very likely to fail. The deflationary spiral that began earlier in the year rapidly and severely intensifies\n\nJune-July: German banking crisis. The Reichsbank loses 840 million marks in less than 3 weeks as investors pull out short-term deposits. Germany's second largest bank, Danatbank, becomes insolvent on July 13th. Two day bank holiday is declared. Industry suffers a catastrophic collapse. The Hoover Moratorium is issued June 20th, suspending reparation payments from Germany to stabilize the country. Although private banks in New York City and the Bank of England begin emergency lending to Germany, the banking crisis spills over into Hungary and Romania, and the collapse of the economy paves the way for Adolf Hitler's rise in the July 1932 and March 1933 elections. The contagion also puts increasing pressure on the United Kingdom.\n\nAugust - deepening deficits and demands for a balanced budget lead to Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government raising taxes by £24 million and cutting spending by £96 million, most controversial was the 20% cut to unemployment benefits (a sum of £64 million). The U.K.'s public debt at the time was 180% of GDP, mostly left over from the expenses of World War One. Public outrage would lead to the Labour Party being virtually destroyed in the October 1931 election. \n\nSeptember 21st: Britain leaves the gold standard, and the Pound Sterling depreciates by 25%. Despite warning of disaster, the departure proves beneficial to the British economy, as exports become more competitive. Additionally, the Bank of England was now free to engage in money creation, and reduced interest rates from 6.00% to 2.00%. \n\nOctober 27th: the United Kingdom General election, 1931 takes place, destroying the Labour Party and delivering a landslide victory to the Conservatives. \n\nSeptember - October: Substantial amount of dollar assets (primarily Federal Reserve Notes) are converted to gold in the US by European central banks seeking to cover losses from the panic that had been sweeping Europe since the collapse of CreditAnstalt. In response, the Federal Reserve increases the federal funds rate from 1.50% to 3.50% to stabilize the dollar, but this only worsens the Depression as banks are further strained. The New York Fed had loan $150 million in gold (some 240 tons) to European central banks, and the wisdom of this was questioned as European countries rapidly abandoned the gold standard. As deflation intensified, real interest rates were magnified and rewarded those who held onto money, thus contributing to the deflationary spiral.\n\nYear: Unemployment rises to 23%, GDP growth is -13%, annual inflation rate is -11%, 1,700 banks fail. US nominal GDP falls to $60 billion. Over 13 million in the U.S. are unemployed and 3.5 million in the U.K.\n\nJanuary 22nd - the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is created to lend $2 billion to troubled financial institutions that were not part of the Federal Reserve System that were solvent in the long-run. By 1941, the RFC would lend out some $9.5 billion to banks, railroads, and mortgage associations, as well as state and local governments. \n\nApril - June: Federal Reserve conducts open market transactions, increasing the money supply by $1 billion.\n\nSummer 1932: Majority of foreign trade restrictions take effect, from Smoot-Hawley in the U.S. and Imperial Preference in the British Empire\n\nJune 6th - the Revenue Act of 1932 is signed into law, raising taxes on personal income, corporate income, and sales taxes on various goods.\n\nJuly: U.S. government discontinues open market operations.\n\nJuly 8th: the Dow Jones Industrial Index bottoms out at 41.22, the lowest level recorded in the 20th Century and representing an 89% loss from its peak in September 1929. \n\nJuly 31st: the German federal election, July 1932 is held, and the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, becomes the largest party in parliament (but lacks a majority)\n\nNovember 6th: the German federal election, November 1932, the last free and fair all-German election until 1990, is held. A minor setback for the Nazi Party, a campaign of mass violence and intimidation would begin in the run up to the next election in March 1933. \n\nNovember 8th: Franklin D. Roosevelt elected 32nd President in a landslide, Democrats win massive majorities in both chambers of Congress.\n\nYear: inflation rate turns positive, at 1% annually. Quarterly GDP growth turns positive by summer, but overall annual rate is -1.3% growth. Unemployment peaks at 25%. 2 million are homeless. Industrial production is half of what it was in 1929. US nominal GDP bottoms out at $57 billion (down from $105 billion in 1929)\n\nFebruary 14th: Michigan becomes the first state in the U.S. to declare an indefinite bank holiday, in an attempt to stem the impending collapse of First National Bank of Detroit and the Guardian National Bank of Commerce, the two largest banks in Detroit. First National and Guardian National were threatened with failure if the Ford Motor Company made good on its desire to withdraw all of its deposits in the two banks; Ford needed the cash to cover its $75 million loss in 1932. At this time, over 80% of Detroit's manufacturing capacity laid idle, and over 400,000 people were unemployed. Michigan's bank holiday set off a contagion of fear across the country, and by March 6th an additional 37 states would declare indefinite bank holidays. \n\nMarch 4th: Franklin D. Roosevelt is inaugurated as President.\n\nMarch 5th - the German federal election, March 1933 is held. The Nazi Party would win a narrow majority of seats, but only in coalition with the German National People's Party (DNVP). Though this would be the last free election before World War II, it is not considered to be a fair election, as the Nazi Party's paramilitary organizations waged a campaign of violence, censorship, intimidation, and harassment against all parties that opposed them, as well as surveillance of voting on election day itself. \n\nMarch 6th - Executive Order 2009 suspends all banking activity for one week, in response to renewed stress on major New York City banks that threatened another round of bank failures and further deepening of the Depression. By this time, 38 states had declared bank holidays. \n\nMarch 9th- The Emergency Banking Act was enacted, which enabled a restructuring of the banking system. Over 4,000 banks with $3.6 billion in deposits that were deemed irreparably insolvent were closed forever, but by March 15th, banks controlling some 90% of the nation's banking activities were back in business. By the end of March, over $1.1 billion in hoarded cash was deposited into the banking system. These new deposits saved cash-starved banks and helped restart the money creation process after years of credit contraction. The Act also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured deposits up to $2,500 and helped restore confidence in the banking system. \n\nMarch 20th - the controversial Economy Act of 1933 is signed into law, slashing $243 million in government salaries and pensions, and veterans' benefits. Despite the economic crisis, supermajorities of American economists, policymakers, and the general public believed that the federal government needed to balance the budget and avoid deficit spending, to avoid putting further strain on the bond market which would negatively affect government borrowing costs, banks, corporations, and foreign investors. From 1929 to 1933, the total debt owed by the U.S. government rose from $16.9 billion to over $23 billion. This \"Economy\" Act was designed to reduce government outlays and assuage fears about government debt and deficits. \n\nMarch 31st - The Civilian Conservation Corps, a public works relief program, is created. It would last until 1942 and is an icon of the New Deal programs. \n\nApril 5th - Executive Order 6102 of President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued, forbidding hoarding of gold coin, bullion, and certificates, effective from May 1, 1933\n\nMay 12th - the Agricultural Adjustment Act is enacted, designed to boost agricultural prices by reducing surpluses.\n\nMay 27th - the Securities Act of 1933 is enacted, requiring the registration of all sales and purchases of financial securities, as well as the disclosure of critical financial information about the firms involved. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was established the following year, which helped combat insider trading and reducing transaction risk.\n\nJuly - Federal Reserve industrial production index rebounds to 85.5, a 57% increase over the 54.3 recorded in March 1933\n\nNovember 8th - the Civil Works Administration is created, which would employ over 4 million people and distribute over $400 million in funds for work programs through its end on March 31, 1934, when it would be replaced by the more permanent Works Progress Administration\n\nDecember 5th - Prohibition is repealed at the national level. 18 states continue with state-level prohibition. The end of Prohibition hurts organized crime, allows legal employment in alcoholic drink production, and increases state tax revenues.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1235687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1235687", "title": "Tony Gaze", "text": "Tony Gaze\n\nFrederick Anthony Owen \"Tony\" Gaze, (3 February 1920 – 29 July 2013) was an Australian fighter pilot and racing driver. He flew with the Royal Air Force in the Second World War, was a flying ace credited with 12.5 confirmed victories (11 and 3 shared), and later enjoyed a successful racing career in the UK, Europe and Australia.\n\nGaze was born in Melbourne, Victoria, on 20 February 1920, the son of Irvine Gaze, a member of the Ross Sea Party who were preparing for Ernest Shackleton's expedition. He was educated at Geelong Grammar School, and when war was declared in September 1939 he was a student at Queens' College, Cambridge.\n\nGaze joined the RAF in 1940, and on completion of training and with 122 hours flying time recorded was posted to No. 610 Squadron RAF at RAF Westhampnett in March 1941, flying cross-channel fighter sweeps. Gaze's first 'kill' came on 26 June when he downed a Messerschmitt Bf 109. The next month he claimed two further victories, one half and two probables. For these victories he was awarded the first of three DFCs. His brother, Pilot Officer Scott Gaze had joined No. 610 Squadron RAF with him in early 1941, but was killed in action on 23 March 1941. In November 1941 Gaze was posted to No. 57 OTU as an instructor.\n\nHe started his second tour in June 1942, with No. 616 Squadron RAF, flying the high altitude Spitfire Mk.IV. During the ill-fated Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942, he received his second DFC after destroying an enemy fighter. In late August 1942 he was posted to command No. 64 Squadron RAF flying the new Spitfire IX.\n\nOn 26 September 1942 Gaze led a wing of Spitfires in support of a bombing raid at Morlaix. An Eagle Squadron, No. 131 Squadron RAF, became scattered in high winds and lost 11 of 12 fighters. Gaze was made the scapegoat for the mission failure and was transferred back to No. 616 Squadron as a flight commander. It was later determined that the cause of the high losses on that mission were due to pilot inexperience and unexpected adverse weather.\n\nAfter a rest from operations in early 1943, he was again posted to an operational Squadron in August 1943, No. 66 Squadron RAF at RAF Kenley. On 4 September 1943 over Le Tréport after downing a Focke Wulf 190 Gaze's own Spitfire V was shot down by Heinz-Gerhard Vogt of II./JG 26 (his 14th claim of an eventual 48). Gaze crash landed 20 miles from Dieppe with slight injuries, evaded capture and made his way, with help from the French Resistance, to neutral Spain.\n\nIn February 1944 Gaze joined the Air Fighting Development Unit (ADFU) at Wittering, rejoining No. 610 Squadron on the continent in July 1944. He claimed a Messerschmitt Me 262 jet shot down near Emmrich on Rhine on 14 February 1945 (a Me 262A-2 of I./KG 51 flown by Rudolf Hoffmann) (the first Australian to achieve this feat) and shared an Arado Ar 234 jet bomber on 12 April 1945.\n\nThe Me 262 victory resulted in Gaze being awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for the third time; one of only 47 men in the Second World War.\n\nAfter a month with No. 41 Squadron RAF in April, on 2 May 1945 he was posted as a flight commander to No. 616 squadron, becoming one of the first Australians (after F/O JN McKay, RAAF) to fly the Gloster Meteor in combat during the closing stages of the war.\n\nDuring the war he had also flown with some of the most famous names including Wing Commander Douglas Bader, top Allied ace Johnnie Johnson (38 victories) as part of the RAF's Tangmere Wing and Paul Tibbets, pilot of the 'Enola Gay', B29 Bomber that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.\n\nGaze ended the war as Australia's tenth ranking highest ace, claiming 12.5 confirmed destroyed (11 and 3 shared (note: below list includes the destruction of a V1)), 4 probables, and 5 damaged in 488 combat missions, all while flying the Spitfire.\n\nIn 1946, Gaze suggested to the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, better known as “Freddie March”, that the roads around RAF Westhampnett would be a good location for a racing track. Acting on this suggestion, March opened the Goodwood Circuit in 1948.\n\nGaze returned to Australia after the war, and began racing an Alta racing car that he brought with him.\n\nHe raced an Alta Formula 2 in Europe for the 1951 season, switching to an HWM-Alta for the following season, planning to racing again in F2. When the sports governing body decided to change the World Championship regulations from Formula One to Formula 2, Gaze’s plans changed as well. He took part in a number of non-championship F1 events, and then in June travelled to the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps for the Grote Prijs van Belgie. After qualifying the HWM-Alta 16th, he raced one place better, attaining 15th place. By racing in Spa, Gaze became the first Australian to contest a World Championship motor race. This was followed by appearances in the RAC British Grand Prix and the Groβer Preis von Deutschland, although he failed to qualify for the Gran Premio d’Italia.\n\nThe following year, he was a member of the first Australian crew to attempt the Rallye Monte Carlo in a Holden FX with Lex Davison and Stan Jones. At one point, the trio was in the top ten, but finished the event in 64th. Also that season, he raced an Aston Martin DB3 in sports car events across Europe, and survived an accident in the Grande Prémio de Portugal, when his car struck a tree after a collision with a Ferrari. He was thrown clear as the Aston flipped over and burst into flames. Gaze was carried to safety by spectators, and suffered only cuts and bruises.\n\nIn 1954 and 1955, Gaze raced the ex-Ascari Ferrari 500 F2 in non-championship events in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. On his return to England, he set up the Kangaroo Stable, the first Australian international racing team. One team member was a young Jack Brabham. They ran Aston Martin DB3S. However, many races were cancelled after the Le Mans disaster, and the Stable disbanded at the end of the season. Gaze continued to race for another season.\n\nAfter a conversation with Prince Bira, who was an avid glider competitor, Gaze tried his hand at the sport. He became an active member of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Gliding Club, at Nympsfield and went on to represent Australia in the 1960 World Gliding Championships, which was held at the Butzweiler airfield, near Köln.\n\nTony Gaze was married twice; to Kay Wakefield who died in 1976 and to fellow racing car driver Diana Davison who died in 2012. Davison was the widow of Lex Davison. Gaze was also step-grandfather to the third generation of Davison racing drivers, Alex, Will and James.\n\n\n"}

In a deliberately absurd anachronism, \"Trump\" (Atamnuik) and \"Bernie\" (Adomian) engage in inter-party debates long before their parties' nominations are decided. Originating in October 2015 as a live sketch at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre (UCB) in New York, \"Trump vs. Bernie\" continued throughout the 2016 election season as a 40-city live comedy debate tour and spawned a special one-hour appearance on Comedy Central's @midnight, two hour-long specials produced for Fusion, and a comedy album released by Comedy Dynamics, along with numerous appearances on news and comedy programs, radio shows, and podcasts.\n\nAdomian began impersonating Sanders in May 2015, making an appearance on Dan Harmon's podcast \"Harmontown\" and in a Funny or Die short with a television debut on a September episode of @midnight. Atamanuik performed as Trump at various improv shows starting in August 2015, resulting in a one-man show at UCB New York entitled \"Trump Dump.\" The duo, having known each other from the improv scene since 2008, connected to stage a fake debate in a one-off live sketch on October 12, 2015 at UCB's stand-up showcase \"\"\"Whiplash.\" An edited video of the performance uploaded to YouTube was well-received by websites like Salon and Daily Dot, which lead to a subsequent show at the New York Comedy Festival, where the \"debate\" was moderated by The Daily Show correspondent Hasan Minhaj.\n\nIn January 2016, dates for an initial 12-city US debate tour were announced. Debates were held in Portsmouth and Manchester a day before the New Hampshire presidential primaries that both the real Trump and Sanders won. The tour grew to a total of 40 cities and had an international leg in Amsterdam, Dublin, London, and Montreal. Each debate was moderated by a celebrity guest such as Baratunde Thurston, Andy Richter and Mark Hamill. The tour concluded at the Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal where Atamanuik and Adomian were honored as two of \"Variety\" magazine's 10 Comics to Watch for 2016.\n\nOn March 23, 2016, @midnight deviated from its usual three-person panel game format to host an hour-long \"Trump vs. Bernie\" debate moderated by host Chris Hardwick. According to Hardwick, a Comedy Central executive present at the taping decided to preempt originally scheduled programming to extend the 30 minute show to an hour because he was so impressed. Billed as \"socialist vs. sociopath,\" the episode was subsequently posted to YouTube and has amassed over 7 million views.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, the Fusion network ordered an hour-long debate special and hour-long sketch show special based on the act along with digital content that began with a livestream on Fusion's F-Comedy Facebook page later that night.\n\nThe debate special aired April 27h, 2016. It is moderated by Paul F. Tompkins, Brianna Baker, and Rhea Butcher. Betsy Sodaro plays a protester who heckles Trump throughout the debate. When Sodaro storms the stage, Trump brandishes a gun and shoots her. The special ends with Bernie rushing to Sodaro and tackling Trump.\n\n\"Trump vs. Bernie: Shout the Vote!\" aired later the next month on May 11, 2016. Presented as \"Loudbox,\" a cable news program hosted by Rachel Maddow (Atamanuik) and Chris Matthews (Adomian) with panelists Donna Brazile (Nicole Byer), Jeb Bush (Daniel Van Kirk), and Ben Carson (Jerry Minor), the pundits ignore an impending cataclysmic asteroid strike in favor of political optics while throwing to interviews and field pieces with Trump and Bernie. Atamanuik also impersonates alleged serial killer Robert Durst while Adomian plays former Governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura.\n\nComedy Dynamics released \"Trump vs. Bernie: Live from Brooklyn Starring Anthony Atamanuik and James Adomian\" on July 29, 2016 on vinyl as well as on iTunes and other streaming services. The album featured a tour debate moderated by the Huffington Post's Howard Fineman. It debuted at #5 on Billboard's Comedy Album charts. \n\nAtamanuik and Adomian promoted the debate tour in character on an episode of \"Comedy Bang! Bang!\" that also features Gilbert Gottfried. On February 12, 2016, a week after the New Hampshire primary, CNN's Brooke Baldwin interviewed Atamanuik and Adomian on Newsroom as if they were the real life candidates. The duo has appeared on The Howard Stern Show twice: first in June 2016 and again after the election of Donald Trump.\n\nBoth Atamanuik and Adomian have received praise for their portrayals. Critic for \"The New York Times\" Jason Zinoman said of their initial debate, \"The best sketch about the current political campaign that I've seen this year was not on 'Saturday Night Live.'\" Dan Caffrey of The A.V. Club credits Atamanuik with taking a \"psychological approach\" with \"moments of self-awareness\" that allows him explore the emptiness of Trump's soul. Both Salon and Huffington Post called Adomian's Sanders better than Larry David's, which Jené Gutierrez of the Daily Dot attributed to his ability to not only capture the essence of Sanders, but to bolster it with improvisation that \"communicates complex issues in an accessible way\" and transforms it into \"smart and subtly flattering comedy.\" Comedian Patton Oswalt agreed saying, \"[ James Adomian ] and [ Anthony Atamanuik ] are the scary best at everything. Actor Mark Hamill said of the routine, \"Beyond hilarious! On a scale of 1-10, it's an 11! TREMENDOUS Trump. BRILLIANT Bernie.\"\n\nAfter the election of Donald Trump, Comedy Central premiered \"The President Show\" on April 27, 2017 as a weekly late-night show starring Atamanuik. Adomian reprised his role as Bernie on an episode of the show as well as on its one-hour special \"I Came Up With Christmas.\"\n\n"}
