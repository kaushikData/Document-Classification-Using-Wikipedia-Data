{"id": "4731828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4731828", "title": "Balkans Campaign (World War I)", "text": "Balkans Campaign (World War I)\n\nThe Balkans Campaign, or Balkan Theatre of World War I was fought between the Central Powers, represented by Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Germany and the Ottoman Empire on one side and the Allies, represented by France, Montenegro, Russia, Serbia, and the United Kingdom (and later Romania and Greece, who sided with the Allied Powers) on the other side.\n\nThe prime cause of World War I was the hostility between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Consequently, some of the earliest fighting took place between Serbia and Austria-Hungary. Serbia held out against Austria-Hungary for more than a year before it was conquered in late 1915.\n\nDalmatia was a strategic region during World War I that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy entered the war in 1915 upon agreeing to the Treaty of London that guaranteed Italy a substantial portion of Dalmatia.\n\nAllied diplomacy was able to bring Romania into the war in 1916 but this proved disastrous for the Romanians. Shortly after they joined the war, a combined German, Austrian and Bulgarian offensive conquered two-thirds of their country in a rapid campaign which ended in December 1916. However, the Romanian and Russian armies managed to stabilize the front and hold on to Moldavia.\n\nIn 1917, Greece entered the war on the Allied side, and in 1918, the multi-national Allied Army of the Orient, based in northern Greece, finally launched an offensive which drove Bulgaria to seek peace, recaptured Serbia and finally halted only at the border of Hungary in November 1918.\n\nThe Serbian Army was successfully able to rebuff the larger Austro-Hungarian Army due to Russia's assisting invasion from the north. In 1915 the Austro-Hungarian Empire placed additional soldiers in the south front while succeeding to engage Bulgaria as an ally.\n\nShortly after the Serbian forces were attacked from both the north and east, forcing a retreat to Greece. Despite the loss, the retreat was successful and the Serbian Army remained operational in Greece with a newly established base.\n\nRomania before the war was an ally of Austria-Hungary but, like Italy, refused to join the war when it started. The Romanian government finally chose to side with the Allies in August 1916, the main reason for this was that they wanted the annexation of Transylvania, to the Kingdom of Romania. The war started with an advance of Romanian troops in Transylvania. The Central Powers' counteroffensive pushed back the Romanian Army to the Carpathians line. After bloody battles along the Southern Carpathians line, German 9th Army made a breakthrough in the Jiu Valley, passing the Carpathians. From this point the Romanians started a long retreat through succesive defending lines. Before the year was out, the Germans, Hungarians, Austrians, Bulgarians and Ottomans had conquered Wallachia. Russian and Romanian forces together with a Serbian military unit had to cede step by step Dobruja.\n\nIn 1917, re-trained (mainly by a French military mission under the command of General Henri Berthelot) and re-supplied, the Romanian Army, together with a disintegrating Russian Army, were successful in containing the German-Austro-Hungarian advance into Moldavia at Mărăşti, Mărăşeşti and Oituz.\n\nIn May 1918, Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and after the German advance in the Ukraine Romania, surrounded by the Central Powers forces, had no other choice but to sue for peace (see Treaty of Bucharest (1918)).\n\nAfter the Vardar Offensive on the Macedonian Front knocked Bulgaria out of the war, Romania re-entered the war on November 10, 1918.\n\nPrior to direct intervention in World War I, Italy occupied the port of Vlorë in Albania in December 1914. Upon entering the war, Italy spread its occupation to region of southern Albania beginning in the autumn 1916. Italian forces in 1916 recruited Albanian irregulars to serve alongside them. Italy with permission of the Allied command, occupied Northern Epirus on 23 August 1916, forcing the neutralist Greek Army to withdraw its occupation forces from there.\n\nIn June 1917, Italy proclaimed central and southern Albania as a protectorate of Italy while Northern Albania was allocated to the states of Serbia and Montenegro. By 31 October 1918, French and Italian forces expelled the Austro-Hungarian Army from Albania.\n\nDalmatia was a strategic region during World War I that both Italy and Serbia intended to seize from Austria-Hungary. Italy joined the Triple Entente Allies in 1915 upon agreeing to the London Pact that guaranteed Italy the right to annex a large portion of Dalmatia in exchange for Italy's participation on the Allied side. From 5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached Lissa, Lagosta, Sebenico, and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.\n\nBy the end of hostilities in November 1918, the Italian military had seized control of the entire portion of Dalmatia that had been guaranteed to Italy by the London Pact and by 17 November had seized Fiume as well. In 1918, Admiral Enrico Millo declared himself Italy's Governor of Dalmatia. Famous Italian nationalist Gabriele d'Annunzio supported the seizure of Dalmatia, and proceeded to Zadar in an Italian warship in December 1918.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Balkan Wars Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them. The government aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria-Hungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of Britain and France) were all in possession of lands heavily populated by Bulgarians and thus perceived as Bulgarian.\n\nBulgaria, recuperating from the Balkan Wars, sat out the first year of World War I. When Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the Treaty of San Stefano, Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. Britain, France and Italy then declared war on Bulgaria.\n\nAlthough Bulgaria, in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, occupying much of Southern Serbia (taking Nish, Serbia's war capital in November 5), advancing into Greek Macedonia, and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered enormous economic hardship. The Russian Revolution of February 1917 had a significant effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities.\n\nIn September 1918 the Serbs, British, French, Italians and Greeks broke through on the Macedonian front in the Vardar Offensive. While Bulgarian forces stopped them in Dojran and they didn't proceed to occupy Bulgarian lands, Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace.\n\nIn order to head off the revolutionaries, Ferdinand abdicated in favour of his son Boris III. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the Treaty of Neuilly (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline in favour of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers (transferred later by them to Greece) and nearly all of its Macedonian territory to the new state of Yugoslavia, and had to give Dobruja back to the Romanians (see also Dobruja, Western Outlands, Western Thrace).\n\nIn 1915 the Austrians gained military support from Germany and, with diplomacy, brought in Bulgaria as an ally. Serbian forces were attacked from both north and south and were forced to retreat through Montenegro and Albania, with only 155,000 Serbs, mostly soldiers, reaching the coast of the Adriatic Sea and evacuated to Greece by Allied ships.\n\nThe front stabilized roughly around the Greek border, through the intervention of a Franco-British-Italian force which had landed in Salonica. The German generals had not let the Bulgarian army advance towards Salonika, because they hoped they could persuade the Greeks to join the Central powers.\n\nIn 1918, after a prolonged build-up, the Allies, under the energetic French General Franchet d'Esperey leading a combined French, Serbian, Greek and British army, attacked out of Greece. His initial victories convinced the Bulgarian government to sue for peace. He then attacked north and defeated the German and Austrian forces that tried to halt his offensive.\n\nBy October 1918 his army had recaptured all of Serbia and was preparing to invade Hungary proper. The offensive halted only because the Hungarian leadership offered to surrender in November 1918.\n\nThe Russians had to pour extra divisions and supplies to keep the Romanian army from being utterly destroyed again by the Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian army. According to John Keegan, the Russian Chief of Staff, General Alekseev, was very dismissive of the Romanian army and argued that they would drain, rather than add to the Russian reserves. \n\nThe French and British kept six divisions each on the Greek frontier from 1916 till the end of 1918. Originally, the French and British went to Greece to help Serbia, but with Serbia's conquest in the fall of 1915, their continued presence was pointless. For nearly three years, these divisions accomplished essentially nothing and only tied down half of the Bulgarian army, which wasn't going to go far from Bulgaria in any event.\n\nIn fact, Keegan argues that \"the installation of a violently nationalist and anti-Turkish government in Athens, led to Greek mobilization in the cause of the \"Great Idea\" - the recovery of the Greek empire in the east - which would complicate the Allied effort to resettle the peace of Europe for years after the war ended.\"\n\n"}

The first Be in Belhaven festival took place on 2 August 2008. The event was run by the Be in Belhaven Planning Group, an amalgamation of local volunteer groups, Wishaw Patch Voice and Friends of Belhaven, as a free charity event with donations on the day of the event going to a chosen charity. The main beneficiary being Maggie's Cancer Centers In Particular Maggie's Lanarkshire Interim service at Wishaw General Hospital.\n\nIn the Autumn of 2007, Friends of Belhaven, a Belhaven Park community group, approached Wishaw Patch Voice, a local youth group known locally for running music events, about providing live music for a family fun day. As one thing led to another, the family funday became a fully fledged music festival.\n\nThe event rook place on 2 August and was run as a Music Festival and a Family Funday. Along with the Main Stage there was also an Acoustic Tent run by the Foundry Music Lab, a Recording studio run by Wet Wet Wet guitarist Graeme Duffin. There was also many activities put on for young children in a bid to attract people along early in the day with the music becoming the main focus later in the day.\nHeadliners for the event were Glasgow girl band The Hedrons who, having already had chart success, was seen as a real coup. Negotiations with other chart acts The Holloways and The Rumble Strips had broken down. 34 other bands also played the event including tribute act, The Underground Jam and local bands such as Rocketfox, The Lafontaines, The Down & Outs, The Jackanoorys, Station Sound, The Seventeenth Century and Opportunity Club \n\nThe event turned out to be a much greater success than anticipated, attracting over 6000 people on the day and raising £2500 for Oxfam, making it the largest Oxjam ever at that point in time.\n\nAdditionally the event was seen a success by the local community and police force and heralded as a \"modern take on the gala day\". Despite there being a large number of people on site along with a licensed bar, there was no incidents in the park.\n\nAfter the overwhelming success of the 2008 festival, there was demand to stage it as an annual event. Plans were put in place in late 2008 and the decision was made to keep the event in Belhaven Park despite the inevitable increase in size off the event.\nAt an early stage management of local establishment The Commercial Hotel got on board as a main sponsor of the event, handling the bars and catering.\nFeedback suggested that the event be kept as to local bands thus keeping the community vibe, although 2008 favourites, The Underground Jam, were invited back to close the event. This led to auditions for the main stage being held with the hope of uncovering some hidden gems in the local community, one band that turned up chancing their luck actually opened the festival. The Foundry Music Lab ran a new stage while Aromas Cafe took over the acoustic tent.\n\nBe in Belhaven 2009 took place on Saturday, 15 August. In addition to the music and funday events there was also a community learning village, fun fair attractions, Dance tent and a chainsaw carver.\n\nOver 50 acts performed on 3 stages over the day, raising money for Oxfam and Maggies Centres. The acts included Still Vintage, The Underground Jam, The Lafontaines, Tempercalm, MakethisRelate, Dear Stars guitarist Stephen Archieblad's former band Midas, The Jackanoorys, Station Sound, Crossfire and Annie Stevenson. Wet Wet Wet guitarist Graeme Duffin made a special appearance in the Foundry Music Lab Arena alongside JJ Gilmour, of The Silencers fame. The event was once again more successful than anticipated as over 10,000 people and went on to raise around £6000 for charity.\n\nBe in Belhaven returned for a third year in 2010 on 7 August. Maggies Cancer Centres became the sole beneficiary of the event for the first time. The practical side of the event didn't vary much from the 2009 event other than a bigger bar area and a much larger main stage.\n\nEven more acts than before performed at the event, this time around 65. Among these acts were headliners The Beatles, a Beatles tribute act, local heroes Crossfire, Leeds boys The Stella Frays, The Lafontaines, MakethisRelate, and Vigo Thieves.Wet Wet Wet guitarist Graeme Duffin made a special appearance in the Foundry Music Lab Arena playing with family members under the guise of The Duffins. The event was regarded as a success as around 10,000 people attended the event on the day.\n\nAfter three successful years, Be in Belhaven returns to cement its place as North Lanarkshire's biggest annual festival. The event is due to take place on Saturday 13 August.\n\nThe same fair event is on Saturday 11 August 2012.\n\nFunding for the events has been provided by multiple sources including North Lanarkshire Council, The Big Lottery Fund and Municipal Bank.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14788955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14788955", "title": "British Formula Ford Championship", "text": "British Formula Ford Championship\n\nThe British Formula Ford Championship was an entry level single seater motor sport category, designed to give racing drivers their first step into car racing after karting. Drivers from across the world were attracted to the United Kingdom to compete in the series, and successful Formula One drivers such as Ayrton Senna and Jenson Button won their first single-seater titles in the championship. The championship was run to various Formula Ford regulations over the years, based on the engines provided for the championship by Ford Motor Company. These engine based regulations/specifications include the Ford Kent engine, Ford Zetec engine, Ford Duratec engine and in the final years the Ford EcoBoost engine.\n\nFrom the 2015 season onwards, the championship will be replaced by MSA Formula, which conforms to the FIA's new Formula 4 regulations. Many of the teams and drivers which competed in the final season of British Formula Ford will move to the new series.\n\nAlthough the first British Formula Ford Championship was not held until 1976, Formula Ford's roots are firmly situated in the British racing scene. The first Formula Ford race was held at Brands Hatch in 1967 and was the precursor to the birth of the domestic championship. The first British Formula Ford Championship, held in 1976, was the original Formula Ford Championship which gave birth to many others over the years, including successful championships in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe championship started out with the 1600cc Ford Kent engine and continued to use it until Ford introduced its newer, more powerful 1800cc Ford Zetec engine. Although this engine change didn't affect the other technical regulations, which still called for steel space frames which were much more economical to build and run compared to their carbon fiber counterparts, the increased engine power accelerated chassis development, causing many of the smaller manufacturers stopped producing cars, resulting in fewer constructors represented in the championship. The Zetec regulations lasted only 12 years up until the Ford Duratec engine was introduced in 2006, providing better handling and power due to its lighter weight even though the specification had returned to 1600cc engines.\n\nThe biggest changes to the championship came in 2012 when the latest Ford EcoBoost engine and specification was adopted as the main championship. The EcoBoost car marks a substantial change in the direction of Formula Ford racing as it introduces both smaller capacity Turbocharged petrol engines and for the first time a sequential gearbox.\n\nThe championship currently allows two specification of Formula Ford car to race: the current generation EcoBoost car and the previous generation Duratec car. The championship is multi-chassis, featuring manufacturers such as Van Diemen and Mygale. To help keep costs low, cars are made from steel, as opposed to the more exotic carbon fibre commonly found in higher categories of racing. The Duratec cars were introduced in 2006, when all the cars in the series were required to use the 1600cc Naturally aspirated Ford Duratec engine which replaced the Ford Kent engine that had been used since the championships inception. Beginning in 2012, the EcoBoost class was introduced to run as the premier class alongside a secondary class for the aging Duratec cars. The EcoBoost class utilises Ford's latest EcoBoost engine which provides greater power thanks to the introduction of a Turbo Charger. The chassis however remains a steel space frame rather than the carbon fibre Monocoque found in other formulae.\n\nFrom 2015 onwards, the MSA Formula will use Formula 4 regulations. Mygale will continue to provide the carbon-fibre monocoque chassis (As opposed to the Tatuus supplied chassis used in BRDC F4. The engine will be a Ford 1.6L EcoBoost engine as used in the more modern Formula Ford cars, tuned to a maximum of 160 PS. All engines will be tuned by the same race engine preparer, in an attempt to reduce costs. Similarly, all tyres will be provided by Hankook. Sadev will provide the sequential paddle shift transmission and data logging system.\n\nFrom 2013, the championship is composed of 30 rounds held at ten events in support of the British Touring Car Championship. Both EcoBoost and Duratec classes compete in the same races as each other. Drivers who have competed in less than 4 junior formula races in the past are eligible to compete for the Rookie Cup, whilst both Teams and Constructors have separate championships for themselves. The Nations Cup is awarded to the highest placed registered driver from each country excluding UK. In 2015, the series will again run 30 rounds at ten events in support of the BTCC, despite becoming the MSA Formula.\n\nA 20-minute qualifying session is used to decide the grid for the all the weekends races. The drivers fastest lap decides the grid for race one, their second fastest time decides the grid for race two and their third fastest time, the grid for race three. All three races will be run over 15 miles.\n\nPoints are awarded to all finishing drivers in each race as well as the driver setting the fastest lap using the following system:\n\nSuch was the popularity of the formula in the UK over its history; there is an abundance of second hand chassis from previous generations of the championship. This has led to the formation of several other national and club level championships within the UK catering for legacy chassis, engines and cars.\n\nThe Formula Ford Festival is an annual meeting of Ford powered single seat racing cars which is held at the end of the British racing season, at the Brands Hatch motor racing circuit in the county of Kent, in Southern England. The events are held over the course of a weekend and although various classes of past and present Formula Fords are present, the high point for many is the championship in which young but skilled drivers from Ford competitions in Europe and beyond race against one another. Often it is a rare chance to compare the skills of drivers who take part in different Ford competitions across the world. The event is administered by the British Racing and Sports Car Club.\n\n"}

{"id": "283542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=283542", "title": "Fashoda Incident", "text": "Fashoda Incident\n\nThe Fashoda Incident or Crisis was the climax of imperial territorial disputes between Britain and France in Eastern Africa, occurring in 1898. A French expedition to Fashoda on the White Nile river sought to gain control of the Upper Nile river basin and thereby exclude Britain from the Sudan. The French party and a British-Egyptian force (outnumbering the French by 10 to 1) met on friendly terms, but back in Europe, it became a war scare. The British held firm as both empires stood on the verge of war with heated rhetoric on both sides. Under heavy pressure the French withdrew, securing Anglo-Egyptian control over the area. The status quo was recognised by an agreement between the two states acknowledging British control over Egypt, while France became the dominant power in Morocco. France had failed in its main goals. P.M.H. Bell says:\n\nIt was a diplomatic victory for the British as the French realized that in the long run they needed the friendship of Britain in case of a war between France and Germany. It was the last crisis between the two that involved a threat of war (until 1940) and opened the way for closer relations in the Entente cordiale of 1904. It gave rise to the 'Fashoda syndrome' in French foreign policy, or seeking to assert French influence in areas which might be becoming susceptible to British influence.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Africa was rapidly being claimed and exploited by European colonial powers. After the 1885 Berlin Conference regarding West Africa, Europe's great powers went after any remaining lands in Africa that were not already under another European nation's influence. This period in African history is usually called the Scramble for Africa. The two principal powers involved in this scramble were Britain and France, along with Germany, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Spain.\n\nThe French thrust into the African interior was mainly from the continent's Atlantic coast (modern Senegal) eastward, through the Sahel along the southern border of the Sahara, a territory covering modern Senegal, Mali, Niger, and Chad. Their ultimate goal was to have an uninterrupted link between the Niger River and the Nile, hence controlling all trade to and from the Sahel region, by virtue of their existing control over the caravan routes through the Sahara. France also had an outpost near the mouth of the Red Sea in Djibouti (French Somaliland), which could serve as an eastern anchor to an east-west belt of French territory across the continent.\n\nThe British, on the other hand, wanted to link their possessions in Southern Africa (South Africa, Bechuanaland and Rhodesia), with their territories in East Africa (modern Kenya), and these two areas with the Nile basin. Sudan, which then included today's South Sudan and Uganda, was the key to the fulfilment of these ambitions, especially since Egypt was already under British control. This 'red line' (i.e. a proposed railway, see Cape to Cairo Railway) through Africa was made most famous by the British and South African political force Cecil Rhodes, who wanted Africa \"painted [British] Red\".\n\nIf one draws a line from Cape Town to Cairo (Rhodes' dream) and another line from Dakar to French Somaliland (now Djibouti) by the Red Sea in the Horn (the French ambition), these two lines intersect in eastern South Sudan near the town of Fashoda (present-day Kodok), explaining its strategic importance. The French east-west axis and the British north-south axis could not co-exist; the nation that could occupy and hold the crossing of the two axes would be the only one able to proceed with its plan.\n\nFashoda was also bound up in the Egyptian Question, a long running dispute between the United Kingdom and France over the legality of the British occupation of Egypt. Since 1882 many French politicians, particularly those of the \"parti colonial\", had come to regret France’s decision not to join with Britain in occupying the country. They hoped to force Britain to leave, and thought that a colonial outpost on the Upper Nile could serve as a base for French gunboats. These in turn were expected to make the British abandon Egypt. Another proposed scheme involved a massive dam, cutting off the Nile’s water supply and forcing the British out. These ideas were highly impractical, but they succeeded in alarming many British officials.\n\nA French force of only 120 \"tirailleurs\" (Senegalese infantrymen) plus 12 French officers, non-commissioned officers and support staff — Captain Marcel Joseph Germain, Captain Albert Baratier, Captain Charles Mangin, Captain Victor Emmanuel Largeau, Lieutenant Félix Fouqué, teacher Dyé, doctor Jules Emily Major, Warrant Officer De Prat, Sergeant George Dat, Sergeant Bernard, Sergeant Venail and the military interpreter Landerouin — set out from Brazzaville in a borrowed Belgian steamer, under Major Jean-Baptiste Marchand with orders to secure the area around Fashoda, and make it a French protectorate. They steamed up the Ubangi River to its head of navigation and then marched overland through jungle and scrub to the deserts of Sudan. They travelled across Sudan to the Nile River. They were to be met there by two expeditions coming from the east across Ethiopia, one of which, from Djibouti, was led by Christian de Bonchamps, veteran of the Stairs Expedition to Katanga.\n\nFollowing a difficult 14-month trek across the heart of Africa, the Marchand Expedition arrived on 10 July 1898, but the de Bonchamps Expedition failed to make it after being ordered by the Ethiopians to halt, and then suffering accidents in the Baro Gorge. Marchand's small force was thus alone. On 18 September a flotilla of five British gunboats arrived at the isolated Fashoda fort. They carried 1,500 British and Egyptian/Sudanese soldiers, led by Sir Herbert Kitchener and including Lieutenant-Colonel (later General) Horace Smith-Dorrien. Marchand had received incorrect reports that the approaching force consisted of Dervishes but now found himself facing a diplomatic rather than a military crisis.\n\nAs the commander of the Anglo-Egyptian army that had just defeated the forces of the Mahdi at the Battle of Omdurman, Kitchener was in the process of reconquering the Sudan in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, and after the battle he opened sealed orders to investigate the French expedition. Kitchener, a fluent French speaker, landed at Fashoda wearing Egyptian Army uniform, and the two commanders behaved with admirable restraint. Both sides insisted on their right to Fashoda but agreed to wait for further instructions from home.\n\nNews of the meeting was relayed to Paris and London, where it inflamed the imperial pride of both nations. Widespread popular outrage followed, each side accusing the other of naked expansionism and aggression. The crisis continued throughout September and October. The Royal Navy drafted war orders and mobilized its reserves.\n\nIn naval terms, the situation was heavily in Britain's favour, a fact that French deputies acknowledged in the aftermath of the crisis. Significant credit has been given to Marchand for remaining calm.\n\nThe military facts were undoubtedly important to Théophile Delcassé, the newly appointed French foreign minister. \"They have soldiers. We only have arguments,\" he said resignedly. Besides he saw no advantage in a colonial war with the British, especially since he was keen to gain their friendship in case of any future conflict with Germany. He therefore pressed hard for a peaceful resolution of the crisis although it encouraged a tide of nationalism and anglophobia. In a scathing editorial published in L’Intransigeant on 13 October Victor Henri Rochefort wrote, \"Germany keeps slapping us in the face. Let’s not offer our cheek to England.\" According to nationalists France’s capitulation was clear evidence that the French army had been severely weakened by the traitors who supported Dreyfus. Yet the reopening of the Dreyfus Affair in January had done much to distract French public opinion from events in the Sudan and with people increasingly questioning the wisdom of a war over such a remote part of Africa, the French government quietly ordered its soldiers to withdraw on 3 November and the crisis ended peacefully. Marchand chose to withdraw his small force by way of Abyssinia and Djibouti, rather than cross Anglo/Egyptian territory by taking the relatively quick journey by steamer up the Nile.\n\nIn March 1899, the French and British agreed that the source of the Nile and the Congo rivers should mark the frontier between their spheres of influence.\n\nThe Fashoda incident was the last serious colonial dispute between Britain and France, and its classic diplomatic solution is considered by most historians to be the precursor of the Entente Cordiale.\n\nThe two main protagonists are commemorated in the Pont Kitchener-Marchand, a road bridge over the Saône, completed in 1959 in the French city of Lyon.\n\nIn 1904, Fashoda was officially renamed Kodok. It is located in modern-day South Sudan.\n\n\n\n"}

Lynch, 491 F.Supp. 381 (1980), was a decision in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island that upheld the right of a gay student to bring a same-sex date to a high school dance. The Court ruled that existing free speech doctrine protected gay and lesbian students' rights to attend their proms with same-sex dates of their choice. The case was \"one of the first successful victories in the courtroom for an LGBT issue involving young people, and is routinely cited each year in numerous cases surrounding the rights of students to bring same-sex dates to school functions.\"\n\nIn April 1979, a gay high school junior named Paul Guilbert sought his principal's permission to bring a male date, Ed Miskevich, a senior at Brown University, to his junior prom at Cumberland High School in Rhode Island. The principal, Richard Lynch, \"denied the request, fearing that student reaction could lead to a disruption at the dance and possibly to physical harm to Guilbert.\" The Cumberland School Department denied a public hearing to Paul Guilbert because his father opposed his plan to attend with a male date. Guilbert and Miskevich did not attend the prom.\n\nThe next year, Guilbert's friend Aaron Fricke, who was also a gay student at Cumberland High School, again asked Lynch for permission to bring a same-sex date to a school dance. Lynch denied the request in a letter to Fricke citing the \"real and present threat of physical harm to [Fricke], [his] male escort and to others.\"\n\nLynch also wrote that \"the adverse effect among [Fricke's] classmates, other students, the School and the Town of Cumberland, which is certain to follow approval of such a request for overt homosexual interaction (male or female) at a class function\" was sufficient ground for rejecting the request.\n\nFricke, represented by John Ward of Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, seeking a preliminary injunction that would allow him to attend the dance.\n\nThe Court, accepting Fricke's freedom of speech claim, decided that \"even a legitimate interest in school discipline does not outweigh a student's right to peacefully express his views in an appropriate time, place, and manner.\" The Court wrote that threats of physical violence against Fricke and his date gave homophobic students an unconstitutional \"heckler's veto\" that would allow \"them to decide through prohibited and violent methods what speech will be heard.\"\n\nThe judge ruled that the precedent of \"United States v. O'Brien\", 391 U.S. 367, 88 S. Ct. 1673, 20 L. Ed. 2d 672 (1968), was the appropriate framework for judging the constitutionality of Lynch's decision. \"O'Brien\" required that the government and its agents pursue the \"least restrictive alternative\" before making any decision to limit free speech. The judge ruled that Lynch's decision failed to meet the requirement of \"O'Brien\" because the school could have taken \"appropriate security measures to control the risk of harm\" and the principal had not made \"any effort to determine the need for and logistics of additional security.\" The judge ruled that \"the First Amendment requires that such steps\" be taken to investigate and implement security measures.\n\nThe Court found the free speech claim to be dispositive and did not address Fricke's free association and equal protection arguments. With the respect to equal protection arguments, the court noted that \"the school [had] afforded disparate treatment to a certain class of students\" by setting up different policies for those who wished to bring same-sex partners to the dance and those who wanted to bring different-sex partners. Such a policy, the Court said, could be \"profitably analyzed under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nOn May 31, 1980, the press reports said that \"Amid heavy security, homosexual student Aaron Fricke showed up at the senior prom with a male companion. Both wore tuxedos.\" Lynch addressed the senior class earlier in the day and promised to respond to any harassment of the couple with \"very stern measures.\" The school provided six rather than the customary two police officers for security. Some students taunted the couple when they danced together.\n\nFollowing \"Fricke\", American public high schools have increasingly allowed gay and lesbian students to attend school functions with their same-sex partners. In 2004, Murray High School in Utah prohibited same-sex students from participating in the promenade of their prom. Press coverage noted the similarity to Fricke's case. Using \"Fricke\" as a precedent, the ACLU threatened to sue the high school on behalf of its gay and lesbian students. The high school reversed its policy and allowed 17-year-old lesbian Heather Johnston to dance with her girlfriend at the prom.\n\nIn 2010, Itawamba Agricultural High School in Mississippi canceled its prom after pupil Constance McMillen asked to attend with her girlfriend and wear a tuxedo. She reported hostility from other students over the cancellation, and sued the school.\n\n\n"}

As such, he participated in two of the most notable U.S. court cases of the 20th century: the prosecution of Jack Ruby for killing Lee Harvey Oswald, and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion, \"Roe v. Wade\". In addition, Wade was District Attorney when Randall Dale Adams, the subject of the documentary film \"The Thin Blue Line\", was convicted in the murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer.\n\nWade, one of eleven children, was born in Rockwall County, Texas, outside Dallas. A good student, Wade, along with five of his seven brothers, entered the legal profession. Shortly after graduating from the University of Texas at Austin, in 1939, Wade joined the Federal Bureau of Investigation, headed by J. Edgar Hoover. Wade's assignment as Special Agent was to investigate espionage cases along the US East Coast and in South America. During World War II, Wade served in the US Navy, taking part in the invasions of the Philippines and Okinawa.\n\nHe was first elected Rockwall County Attorney. In 1947, Wade joined the Dallas County District Attorney's Office. He won election to the top job only four years later, a position he would hold for 36 years, until his retirement in 1987.\n\nWade was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate in 1956 against the staunchly conservative Republican Representative Bruce Alger of Dallas County. Alger prevailed to win his second of five House terms, 102,380 (55.6 percent) to 81,705 (44.4 percent). After his defeat, Wade remained district attorney for another 30 years.\n\nIn the early afternoon hours of November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Downtown Dallas, just blocks from Wade's office in the Dallas County Courthouse.\n\nWade lost the opportunity to try Lee Harvey Oswald for Kennedy's murder when a Dallas nightclub operator, Jack Ruby, shot the suspect just two days later, but he became known nationally for prosecuting Ruby for Oswald's murder. Wade closely supervised the Ruby trial, but he appointed his assistant, William Alexander, to conduct the courtroom proceedings.\n\nWade and Alexander confronted Ruby's lawyers, famed trial lawyer Melvin Belli and Texas counsellor Joe Tonahill, in a lengthy trial that concluded on March 14, 1964, with a verdict for Ruby of \"guilty of murder with malice.\" The jury had deliberated for less than three hours before arriving at its decision, and it recommended a death penalty.\n\nWade, as Dallas County District Attorney, was the named defendant when attorneys Sarah Weddington and Linda Coffee mounted a 1970 constitutional challenge to the Texas criminal statutes prohibiting doctors from performing abortions. Norma McCorvey (\"Jane Roe\"), a single woman, was signed up as the representative plaintiff. The challenge sought both a declaratory judgment that the Texas criminal abortion statutes were unconstitutional on their face and an injunction restraining the defendant from enforcing the statutes. The lower court refused to grant Roe's desired injunction but declared the criminal abortion statutes were void.\n\nBoth sides cross-appealed. The case worked its way through the appellate process, culminating in the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 \"Roe v. Wade\" decision that made abortion legal in the United States.\n\nDespite the loss of \"Roe v. Wade\" and its unpopularity with conservative voters, Wade himself was not blamed, and his political career did not suffer. He continued to serve in office for an additional 14 years, and he remained a fixture around the new Crowley Courts Building, where members of the Dallas Bar called him \"the Chief.\" In 1995, the Henry Wade Juvenile Justice Center was named in his honor, and in 2000, shortly before his death from Parkinson's disease, \"Texas Lawyer\" magazine named him as one of the 102 most influential lawyers of the 20th century.\n\nWade once again gained national attention in 1988 with the release of Errol Morris's documentary film \"The Thin Blue Line\". The documentary tells the story of Randall Dale Adams' 1977 conviction for the murder of Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. Adams was sentenced to death for the crime. The execution was scheduled for May 8, 1979, but US Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., ordered a stay only three days before the scheduled date. Instead of conducting a new trial, Governor Bill Clements commuted Adams's sentence to life in prison. Adams was exonerated in 1988, after serving 12 years in prison. Similar cases of exonerated men have recently arisen, putting the legality of Wade's practices in question.\n\nAs of July 2008, fifteen persons convicted during Wade's term as Dallas County District Attorney have been exonerated of the crimes for which they were accused in light of new DNA evidence. Because of the culture of the department to \"convict at all costs,\" it is suspected that more innocent people have been falsely imprisoned. Project Innocence Texas currently has more than 250 cases under examination.\n"}

{"id": "7266217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7266217", "title": "Jan Wong controversy", "text": "Jan Wong controversy\n\nThe Jan Wong controversy refers to a claim made by Jan Wong on September 16, 2006, three days after the shooting at Dawson College in Montreal. Canada’s nationally distributed newspaper of record, \"The Globe and Mail\", published a front-page article titled, \"Get under the desk,\" by Jan Wong. In the article, Ms. Wong controversially linked all three Quebec school shootings of the last two decades—1989 École Polytechnique Massacre (15 deaths), 1992 Concordia University Massacre (4 deaths), and 2006 Dawson College Shooting (2 deaths)—to the purported alienation brought about by \"the decades-long linguistic struggle\" within the province. Public outcry and political condemnation soon followed in many venues. In response, a \"Globe and Mail\" editorial attempted to minimize the controversy as a \"small uproar\" over journalistic freedom, but this caused further condemnation. Jan Wong maintained her perspective and wrote extensively about the whole experience in her book \"Out of the Blue, A Memoir of Workplace Depression, Recovery, Redemption and, Yes, Happiness\".\n\nWong suggested that the school shootings might have been related to the fact that the perpetrators were not old-stock French Québécois: (Marc Lépine was half-Algerian, Valery Fabrikant was a Russian Jew, and Kimveer Gill was of Indian heritage); and they had been alienated by a Quebec society concerned with \"racial purity.\" Citing the history of the use of the antiquated term \"pure laine,\" (\"pure wool\"), Wong postulated the existence of a uniquely Québécois brand of racism, writing: \"Elsewhere, to talk of racial ‘purity’ is repugnant. Not in Quebec.\"\n\nThe article also portrayed school shootings in Canada as a Quebec phenomenon, citing Jan Bryan, columnist for the \"Montreal Gazette\", saying, \"Three doesn’t mean anything. But three out of three in Quebec means something.\" It also presented the Montreal anglophone community as a small-town, close-knit community.\n\nHundreds of letters of complaints were received by \"The Globe and Mail\". As in Barbara Kay's case, the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society (SSJB) lodged a complaint to the Quebec Press Council. SSJB president Jean Dorion declared \"There is no obsession for racial purity in Quebec, definitely not. [...] The expression 'pure laine' is absolutely obsolete.\" The blogosphere soon saw a flood of posts against Wong's allegations.\n\nWong received hate mail, including racist comments about her Chinese ethnicity and post containing excrement. She also received a death threat that resulted in Wong's family contacting the police.\n\nA number of Quebec journalists denounced Wong's article. French-born journalist Michel Vastel, in his blog for the news magazine \"L'actualité\", called the article \"deceitful racism\" and the interpretation \"repugnant\". His opposition was advanced again in a following \"Journal de Québec\" piece by Vastel. Wong's article was condemned by federalist \"La Presse\" editorialist André Pratte (in a letter to the \"Globe\" and a \"La Presse\" editorial), journalists Michel C. Auger of \"Le Journal de Montréal\", Michel David and Michel Venne (sovereigntist) of \"Le Devoir\", Alain Dubuc (federalist), Vincent Marissal, Yves Boisvert and Stéphane Laporte of \"La Presse\", Josée Legault (sovereigntist) of \"The Gazette\", Jean-Jacques Samson of \"Le Soleil\", sovereigntist militant and author Patrick Bourgeois of \"Le Québécois\", Gérald Leblanc, retired journalist of \"La Presse\" and Joseph Facal, \"Journal de Montréal\" columnist and former Parti Québécois minister.\n\nAlthough the \"Gazette\" called it \"nonsense\" in an editorial, it found the reaction to be out of proportion, as did Lysiane Gagnon from \"La Presse\", who nonetheless called the theory \"delirious\". \"Gazette\" journalist Don Macpherson wrote: \"By the standards of Wong’s article, one could just as easily blame the [three] shootings on federalism, since all three happened to occur while the Quebec Liberals were in power\". He advanced that, on the contrary, the tragedy and the controversy around Wong's article had shown a remarkable unity between French and English-speaking Quebecers. Barbara Kay, author of the \"Quebecistan\" controversy, herself criticized Wong, calling the analysis \"bullshit\". Jack Jedwab, Executive Director of the Association for Canadian Studies in Montreal and former Executive Director of the Quebec Region of the Canadian Jewish Congress, noted that the expression \"pure laine\" was \"no longer quite common\". He also called the analysis \"nonsense\". \"The Globe and Mail\" remarked that \"[i]n English Canada, unsurprisingly, the response has been considerably more muted\". However, on September 28, 2006, Warren Kinsella wrote a harsh criticism of Wong's work in \"The National Post\". Kinsella was born in Montreal.\n\nMicheline Labelle, director of the \"Centre de recherche sur l’immigration, l’ethnicité et la citoyenneté\" (CRIEC, \"Centre for research on immigration, ethnicity and citizenship\") at the Université du Québec à Montréal stated that she saw in the arguments something akin to \"neoracism\", that is to say, a generalization of a cultural trait applied to a given population. \"For less than that, minorities go to the courts\", she said.\n\nOn September 19, 2006, the Canadian Press reported that federalist Premier of Quebec Jean Charest demanded an apology, calling the article a \"disgrace\". He sent an open letter to the \"Globe\" vigorously defending Quebec's society and its language protection.\n\nConservative Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper called Wong's argument \"prejudiced\", \"absurd\", \"irresponsible\" and \"without foundation\". He sent the \"Globe\" a similar letter. \"These actions (the killings) deserve our unqualified moral condemnation, not an excuse for printing prejudices masked in the language of social theory,\" Harper wrote. Parti Québécois leader André Boisclair declared that the journalist had, on the intellectual level, \"slipped into the dregs\" (\"glissé dans les bas fonds\"). Former Premier of Quebec Bernard Landry declared to \"La Tribune\" \"if she is of good faith, she will have to apologize [...] It is incredible that it is still possible today to convey such delirious opinions on Quebec. Especially in an era when Quebec is more cosmopolitan than ever. [...] It is insulting for Quebec and dishonouring for Canada. In the same way as if I saw a similar article about Ontario in La Tribune, I would be ashamed for La Tribune.\"\n\nCameroon-born Bloc Québécois Member of Parliament Maka Kotto issued a declaration at the House of Commons of Canada stating \"to pretend that there could be a link of any kind of cause-and-effect between the dramatic episode of Dawson College and Bill 101 — described as infamous by the journalist — pertains of a defamatory delirium disconnected from the Quebec reality. [...] Quebec is an inclusive, welcoming society where it is pleasant to live. As an immigrant, I felt very rapidly welcome there and I deplore that the openness of the Quebec people can be put into question.\" He invited the federal government to denounce the writings of Jan Wong as well. On September 20 the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion requesting an apology \"to the Quebec people\" for the column. Denis Coderre, the Liberal MP who tabled the motion, called the column \"classless\". \"People feel there's a sort [...] of trend.\", he said. \"I think that it's enough. We're not \"Quebecistan\", we're not a people that ostracizes, we're a model of integration.\" Coderre was in the group of politicians attacked by Barbara Kay in the \"Quebecistan\" controversy, also accused of \"Quebec bashing\". Marie-Hélène Paradis, press attaché of Quebec Minister of Immigration Lise Thériault, said \"No data can support what Ms. Wong advances.\" She declared that such allegations feed \"the type of fast judgements that lead to discrimination.\"\n\nDespite having voted for the motion, Conservative Member of Parliament Daniel Petit declared that there might be a link, as Wong suggested. \"I think that the billion (dollars) that we put in [the Canadian gun registry ] should have been put into education and integration of immigrants in Montreal\", Petit said. Dimitri Soudas, press attaché for Conservative Prime Minister Harper, said \"The comments of Mr. Petit are unacceptable, he should retract them and it does not reflect in any case the position of the government\", adding that Petit was met by the Prime Minister's cabinet on the subject. MPs of the House of Commons criticized him for his statements, including Michel Gauthier, of the Bloc Québécois, and Denis Coderre, of the Liberal Party of Canada, who demanded apologies. He offered them promptly. \"I made inappropriate remarks,\" Petit said in a statement. \"I withdraw them entirely because you cannot draw any link between the integration of immigrants in Quebec and the terrible tragedy at Dawson College.\"\n\nOn September 21, 2006, \"The Globe and Mail\" published an editorial on the affair. Calling the controversy a \"small uproar\", it defended the right of the journalist to question such phenomena, the \"need to ask hard questions and explore uncomfortable avenues\", saying that it \"merely wondered\". The editor claimed not to be surprised by the hundreds of letters of protest received, including those of First Ministers Charest and Harper. The editorial validated Wong's claims of alienation in Quebec, which the \"Globe\" called \"politics of exclusion\". Asking whether this exclusion led to marginalization and perhaps alienation, it said that the answer is \"arguable\". However, it called the marginalization and alienation of the three shooters \"obvious\". About whether it could be associated with the murders, it answered that \"[n]o such evidence exists\". In a sentence apparently intended to balance the assertions, it implied at the same time that an even worse discrimination existed in the Quebec of the past, as it wrote: \"By the same token, it would be remiss to forget that today’s Quebec is not the Quebec of yesteryear.\" \"The Globe and Mail\" did not issue an apology for Jan Wong's piece, as requested by many, including the unanimous House of Commons.\n\nLeader of the Bloc Québécois Gilles Duceppe declared that he considered the editorial an attempt at justification. \"It even suggests there might be some problems in Quebec because of the language laws. It's unacceptable and it's deplorable and it's shameful for a newspaper of that stature\", he said. \"Try imagining the opposite — If I'd made such nonsensical, absurd remarks (about English Canada). Then all the editorial writers across Canada would get involved.\" Premier of Quebec Jean Charest was said to be disappointed by \"The Globe and Mail\" response. He was also said to be offended by the little consideration the paper gave his open letter, that was published in the readers' opinion page (like the one from Prime Minister Harper). \"The (House of Commons) motion is totally ignored\", said the Premier's press attaché. On September 23, 2006, the Canadian Press reported that Edward Greenspon, editor of \"The Globe and Mail\", expressed regrets. In a \"The Globe and Mail\" column, without making formal apologies, he wrote that the personal opinions of Wong should have been excised from the piece, not because they were unacceptable, but because they constituted a \"thesis\", not a \"statement of fact\". He wrote that \"they should have been put into a separate piece clearly marked opinion\". He however believed the reaction to be clearly disproportionate. Despite Greenspon's insinuation that the piece was not \"clearly marked opinion\", it had in fact been accompanied by a headshot of Wong, the traditional means of designating opinion pieces.\n\nJan Wong declined the invitation of host Guy A. Lepage to explain herself at the popular Québécois talk show \"Tout le monde en parle\". She has declared: \"I brought forward a point of view [...] and I maintain it.\" She has claimed that, during the controversy, she was the target of sexist and racist attacks, citing a \"Le Devoir\" cartoon that caricatured Wong with thick glasses and buck teeth opening a fortune cookie that said \"Beware of Bill 101\". The newspaper claimed that it was a reference to the Chinese restaurants of her well-known father, Bill Wong, not her ethnicity. Jan Wong wrote extensively about the whole experience in her book \"Out of the Blue, A Memoir of Workplace Depression, Recovery, Redemption and Yes, Happiness\". In it, Jan Wong described in detail the backlash she received immediately after her article published, how the Globe and Mail management, in her view, abandoned her in front of the torrent of negative reactions from all sides, and how she spiraled down into depression. She described when she found the ‘exact moment I began my descent into depression’ when she was shattered by racial attack. This book was self-published after Doubleday, the publisher of her previous books, pulled out mere days before print although Doubleday denied any legal interference from \"The Globe\". It was released on May 5, 2012.\n\nThe term \"Québécois de souche\" continued to be used in both English and French media. And in 2007, the Taylor-Bouchard Commission included the recommendation that the use of the expression \"Québécois de souche\" be ended and replaced with the term \"Quebecers of French-Canadian origin.\" The Commission investigated reasonable accommodation of immigrants into Quebec society.\n\nAccording to David Austin, author of \"Fear of a Black Nation,\" (2013) which was based on Austin's two decades of inquiry including interviews and international archival research,\n\n"}

{"id": "61542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61542", "title": "Juneteenth", "text": "Juneteenth\n\nJuneteenth, also known as Juneteenth Independence Day or Freedom Day, is an American holiday that commemorates the June 19, 1865, announcement of the abolition of slavery in the U.S. state of Texas, and more generally the emancipation of enslaved African Americans throughout the former Confederacy of the southern United States. Its name is a portmanteau of \"June\" and \"nineteenth\", the date of its celebration. Juneteenth is recognized as a state holiday or special day of observance in forty-five states.\n\nToday it is observed primarily in local celebrations. Traditions include public readings of the Emancipation Proclamation, singing traditional songs such as \"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\" and \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\", and reading of works by noted African-American writers such as Ralph Ellison and Maya Angelou. Celebrations may include rodeos, street fairs, cookouts, family reunions, park parties, historical reenactments, or Miss Juneteenth contests. The Mascogos, descendants of Black Seminoles, of Coahuila, Mexico also celebrate Juneteenth.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862, with an effective date of January 1, 1863. It declared that all enslaved persons in the Confederate States of America in rebellion and not in Union hands were to be freed. This excluded the five states known later as border states, which were the four \"slave states\" not in rebellion—Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, and Missouri—and those counties of Virginia soon to form the state of West Virginia, and also the three zones under Union occupation: the state of Tennessee, lower Louisiana, and Southeast Virginia.\n\nMore isolated geographically, Texas was not a battleground, and thus the people held there as slaves were not affected by the Emancipation Proclamation unless they escaped. Planters and other slaveholders had migrated into Texas from eastern states to escape the fighting, and many brought enslaved people with them, increasing by the thousands the enslaved population in the state at the end of the Civil War.\nAlthough most enslaved people lived in rural areas, more than 1000 resided in both Galveston and Houston by 1860, with several hundred in other large towns. By 1865, there were an estimated 250,000 enslaved people in Texas. The older, and Hispanic, town of San Antonio had 168 among a population of 3,436. \n\nThe news of General Robert E. Lee's surrender on April 9 reached Texas later in the month. The Army of the Trans-Mississippi did not surrender until June 2. On June 18, Union Army General Gordon Granger arrived at Galveston Island with 2,000 federal troops to occupy Texas on behalf of the federal government. The following day, standing on the balcony of Galveston's Ashton Villa, Granger read aloud the contents of \"General Order No. 3\", announcing the total emancipation of those held as slaves:\n\nFormerly enslaved people in Galveston rejoiced in the streets after the announcement, although in the years afterward many struggled to work through the changes against resistance of whites. The following year, freedmen organized the first of what became the annual celebration of Juneteenth in Texas. In some cities African-Americans were barred from using public parks because of state-sponsored segregation of facilities. Across parts of Texas, freed people pooled their funds to purchase land to hold their celebrations, such as Houston's Emancipation Park, Mexia's Booker T. Washington Park, and Emancipation Park in Austin.\n\nAlthough the date is sometimes referred to as the \"traditional end of slavery in Texas\" it was given legal status in a series of Texas Supreme Court decisions between 1868 and 1874.\n\nIn the early 20th century, economic and political forces led to a decline in Juneteenth celebrations. From 1890 to 1908, Texas and all former Confederate states passed new constitutions or amendments that effectively disenfranchised black people, excluding them from the political process. White-dominated state legislatures passed Jim Crow laws imposing second-class status. The Great Depression forced many black people off farms and into the cities to find work. In these urban environments, African Americans had difficulty taking the day off to celebrate. The Second Great Migration began during World War II, when many black people migrated to the West Coast where skilled jobs in the defense industry were opening up. From 1940 through 1970, in the second wave of the Great Migration, more than 5 million black people left Texas, Louisiana and other parts of the South for the North and West Coast. As historian Isabel Wilkerson writes, \"The people from Texas took Juneteenth Day to Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, and other places they went.\"\n\nBy the 1950s and 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement focused the attention of African-American youth on the struggle for racial equality and the future, but many linked these struggles to the historical struggles of their ancestors. Following the 1968 Poor People's Campaign to Washington D.C. called by Rev. Ralph Abernathy, many attendees returned home and initiated Juneteenth celebrations in areas where the day was not previously celebrated.\n\nSince the 1980s and 1990s, the holiday has been more widely celebrated among African-American communities. In 1994 a group of community leaders gathered at Christian Unity Baptist Church in New Orleans, Louisiana to work for greater national celebration of Juneteenth. Expatriates have celebrated it in cities abroad, such as Paris. Some US military bases in other countries sponsor celebrations, in addition to those of private groups.\n\nAlthough the holiday is still mostly unknown outside African-American communities, it has gained mainstream awareness through depictions in entertainment media, such as episodes of TV series \"Atlanta\" (2016) and \"Black-ish\" (2017), the latter of which featured musical numbers about the holiday by Aloe Blacc, The Roots, and Fonzworth Bentley.\n\nIn 1980, Texas was the first state to establish Juneteenth as a state holiday under legislation introduced by freshman Democratic state representative Al Edwards. Juneteenth is a \"partial staffing\" holiday in Texas; government offices do not close but agencies may operate with reduced staff, and employees may either celebrate this holiday or substitute it with one of four \"optional holidays\" recognized by Texas.\n\nBy 2008, nearly half of US states observed the holiday as a ceremonial observance. As of 2014, 43 of the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have recognized Juneteenth as either a state holiday or ceremonial holiday, a day of observance. States that do not recognize it are Hawaii, Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nIn 1996 the first legislation to recognize \"Juneteenth Independence Day\" was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, H.J. Res. 195, sponsored by Barbara-Rose Collins (D-MI). In 1997 Congress recognized the day through Senate Joint Resolution 11 and House Joint Resolution 56. In 2013 the U.S. Senate passed Senate Resolution 175, acknowledging Lula Briggs Galloway (late president of the National Association of Juneteenth Lineage) who \"successfully worked to bring national recognition to Juneteenth Independence Day\", and the continued leadership of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation. In 2018 Apple added Juneteenth to its calendars in iOS under official US holidays.\n\nOrganizations such as the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation are seeking a Congressional designation of Juneteenth as a national day of observance.\n\n\n\n"}

Cash withdrawals made with her credit card led the police to the kidnapper, a man living in a downtown Brussels apartment, where Bidegård was kept captive. The man was arrested, and his victim rescued, after over four days of a captivity that made headlines in both Sweden and Belgium.\n\nTried in 1995, the kidnapper was sentenced to fifteen years of penal labour. Lars Nilsson, a Swede in his thirties, had no prior convictions and was unanimously described by his family and friends as a kind and socially active person.\n\nBorn on 9 September 1964, Ulrika Bidegård grew up in Onsala, outside Göteborg in Western Sweden. She is the daughter of Kennet Bidegård, a well-off businessman, and of his wife Lena, a former Swedish Olympic gymnast. She started riding rather late in life, at the age of eleven, but quickly developed the skills of a champion. At twenty-three, she moved to Belgium to train with \"Brazilian wizard\" Nelson Pessoa. Thanks to her resulting improvement, she was able to join the Swedish show jumping team. She took part in the European Show Jumping Championships and was to compete in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, but eventually missed the competition after her horse Masada sustained an injury.\n\nMeanwhile, Bidegård's parents had joined her in Belgium in order to take advantage, as many Swedes did in the late 1980s, of the favourable tax laws. They settled in the \"Swedish colony\" of Sint-Genesius-Rode near Brussels where they bought a house. As they found the Belgian interior design style unappealing, and did not speak the local language, they had their new home renovated by a Swedish contractor. Ulrika then moved in with them.\n\nIn the evening of Wednesday 20 January 1993, Ulrika Bidegård drove back home toward Sint-Genesius-Rode, after she spent the day training. Her parents were in Sweden, and the villa was empty. As she parked her car in front of the family house, a man wearing a mask showed up and threatened her with a firearm. Tied up and gagged, she was driven to her kidnapper's apartment in central Brussels. There she was placed in sitting position in a wooden box where she was kept during her whole captivity. Her kidnapper fed her sparingly and gave her water to drink laced with sedative.\n\nThe man called Bidegård's father for the first time at his office in Göteborg. He demanded in English that neither the police nor the media be alerted, and did not talk of any ransom. Kennet Bidegård immediately contacted a prosecutor, who alerted Interpol. When Bidegård's parents landed at Brussels airport, they were greeted by the Belgian police who had established a special task force. The story was quickly leaked to the press by an interpreter, and it made headlines in both Belgium and Sweden.\n\nBecause he had used a public phone booth to make calls to Sweden, the police knew that the kidnapper was located in downtown Brussels, but it was cash withdrawals made with Bidegård's credit card that led them to the man on Saturday 23 January. They followed him, and he led them to his apartment. As they did not know where Ulrika was located, at first they simply put the place under surveillance: an untimely arrest could set Bidegård's life at risk. Meanwhile, a photograph of the kidnapper was shown to Bidegård's parents, who immediately recognised him: he was Lars Nilsson, a carpenter from Sweden, who had been part of the team that had worked on renovating the family house.\n\nIn spite of the constant surveillance of the kidnapper's apartment from a neighbouring building, the police were unable to determine whether Bidegård was held captive there. They finally decided to assault the apartment during the early hours of Monday, expecting to take the kidnapper by surprise. It was 2.30 am on the morning of 25 January when police forces stormed the apartment. Bidegård recovered her freedom after more than four days of captivity, and her kidnapper was arrested.\n\nOn Tuesday 26 January, a letter arrived at the Bidegård's home in Sint-Genesius-Rode. It enclosed a photograph of Ulrika, tied up in her wooden box, along with a laconic demand for ransom: \"500000 USD WEDNESDAY\". This letter had been posted by the kidnapper on the Friday night.\n\nAs the kidnapping took place in Brussels the inquiry was led by the Belgian police, but the Swedish police were asked to look into the background of the accused. When interrogated, relatives and friends depicted a kind, hard-working and socially healthy individual, with no predisposition to commit such a crime. For the Bidegård's themselves, the shock and consternation were enormous, as they had had excellent relations with the carpenter while he was working at their home.\n\nThe judicial inquiry concluded that the motive was purely financial: despite the quality of his work, the man was deeply in debt because of his bad debtors, and had been forced to pledge his parents' house. To get out of his predicament, he resorted to kidnapping the daughter of one of his rich clients.\n\nThe trial opened in Brussels on 2 May 1995. The accused kept a low profile, and apologised to the Bidegård family. On 10 May, he was sentenced to fifteen years of penal labour. He spent four years behind bars in Belgium before being transferred to Sweden, where he finished serving his sentence. He was an exemplary inmate, and became a model of prisoner rehabilitation.\n\nThe kidnapping had both negative and positive impacts on Ulrika Bidegård's life. Unable to cope with the media pressure she put an end to her career as a top-level rider, although she remained active in the field. She became close to one of the Belgian policemen who had taken part in her release, and the two eventually married on 13 August 1994. The wedding was largely covered by the Swedish press. They have had two children.\n\nIn 2008, Ulrika Bidegård was back in Onsala, at the head of a riding school where she was training young riders.\n\nOn 22 June 2013, the Swedish radio station P3 broadcast a documentary produced by Ida Lundqvist on the kidnapping of Ulrika Bidegård.\n"}

It is currently a shopping arcade and part of the Trocadero Centre.\n\nThe first building bearing the name, a music hall formed from roofing the yard of the Black Horse Inn, was built in 1859 for Emil Loibl and Charles Sonnhammer. A gallery was constructed for the hall but it could not utilise the full width, because one part of the premises was used by Dr Kahn's \"Delectable Museum of Anatomy\".\n\nIn 1885 Shaftesbury Avenue was built through part of the site, and a new London Pavilion Theatre was constructed. This opened on 30 November 1885 with a popular revue. The new theatre was the first 'music hall deluxe', with marble-topped tables for dining in the auditorium. According to Charles Stuart and A. J. Park in \"The Variety Stage\" (1895) the rebuilding signalled a new era of variety theatre:Hitherto the halls had borne unmistakable evidence of their origins, but the last vestiges of their old connections were now thrown aside, and they emerged in all the splendour of their new-born glory. The highest efforts of the architect, the designer and the decorator were enlisted in their service, and the gaudy and tawdry music hall of the past gave way to the resplendent 'theatre of varieties' of the present day, with its classic exterior of marble and freestone, its lavishly appointed auditorium and its elegant and luxurious foyers and promenades brilliantly illuminated by myriad electric lights\n\nThe success of the venture led its owner, Villiers, to form a limited company; this became the first combine of music halls, Syndicate Halls Ltd. Lupino Lane made his London début here in 1903, as \"Nipper Lane\".\n\nBetween 1912 and 1936 the theatre presented a regular programme of musicals; these included Noël Coward's first success, \"On With the Dance\" in April 1925. There were appearances by Sir Harry Lauder; in October 1921 the American actor and vocalist Clifton Webb appeared here in \"Fun of the Fayre\" and again in October the following year as Phidas in \"Phi-Phi\". In 1923 electric billboards were erected for the first time on the side of the building.\n\nIn 1934 the building underwent significant structural alteration, and was converted into a cinema at a cost of £70,000 by F. G. M. Chancellor, of Frank Matcham and Co. It was the venue for the première of many films including \"The Curse of Frankenstein\" in May 1957 for which the foyer was revamped to look like Frankenstein's laboratory, complete with the Monster in a tank. In October 1962 it premiered \"Dr. No\", the first James Bond film, and in July 1964 was the venue for the premiere of \"A Hard Day's Night\". In 1986 the Pavilion closed its doors forever as a theatre. The interior of the building was gutted and converted into a shopping arcade, preserving only the 1885 façade and the outer walls and roof. A wax figure exhibition opened in the building that same year, run by the Madame Tussauds Group, called \"Rock Circus\". The exhibition consisted of waxworks of famous rock and pop musicians. The \"Rock Circus\" exhibition closed in September 2001.\n\nIn 2000 the building became part of the Trocadero Centre, and signage on the building was altered in 2003 to read London Trocadero.\n\nThe basement of the building connects with Piccadilly Circus tube station and the rest of the Trocadero Centre.\n\nThe London Pavilion housed Ripley's Believe It or Not!, a visitor attraction dedicated to the weird, the unusual and the unbelievable, which was open from August 2008 until September 25th 2017.\n\n\n\n"}

His name at birth is said to have been Mamugna but he impersonated the son of the dead military officer Marco Antonio Bragadin. He convinced the government of Venice to finance his research into producing gold from base metals.\n\nAlmost nothing is known about Bragadino's childhood and youth. After the conquest of Cyprus by the Ottoman empire, his family presumably left the island for Venice like many other Christians. He claimed to be an illegitimate son of Venetian \"condottiero\" Marco Antonio Bragadin, murdered by the Turks after the siege of Famagusta. In Venice, Bragadino is thought to have met Hieronymus Scotus, from whom he learned the secrets of alchemy and the tricks of pretending to make gold.\n\nIt is unknown why Bragadino had to leave Venice but from 1574 to 1579 he stayed in Florence and was in contact with Grand Duchess Bianca Cappello whom he promised to heal from infertility with the philosopher's stone. This business may explain the high amount of money (Minucci writes of at least 40,000 scudi) that Bragadino was able to spend for a while. Later, Bragadino had to escape his creditors though and moved to Rome where he became a monk in a Capuchin monastery. He received the minor consecrations and also a higher one, becoming Subdeacon. In 1588 he left the cloister without permission and returned to his errant life. He is reported to have visited Geneva, England and France. As he returned to Italy he had to face the Inquisition who pursued the renegade monk. To protect himself, Bragadino made numerous influential friends with his gold making alchemy. The most prominent of them was the Duke of Mantua, who paid 25,000 scudi to him.\n\nThe Republic of Venice invited its former citizen as an official guest to profit from his abilities. On 26 November 1589 Bragadino entered the city as a celebrated alchemist. But because he was not able to \"create\" any noteworthy amounts of money he escaped Venice in April 1590, heading for Padua.\n\nIn Padua he was called upon by William V, Duke of Bavaria. In August 1590, Bragadino arrived at the Duke's court on Trausnitz Castle in Landshut. He quickly gained the Duke's trust, not only by promising to make copious amounts of gold to erase the Duke's debts, but also by offering to cure the Duke's severe headache. Moreover, he tried to receive a dispensation of his priestly consecration from the Pope, using the Duke's envoys, but in vain.\n\nBy order of the Duke, Bragadino was executed by beheading on 26 April 1591 in Munich's \"Weinmarkt\" square. The act turned into a disaster as the executioner had to use three strikes with the sword until Bragadino's head was eventually cut off.\n\nHis role as a colourful figure in the history of alchemism is still remembered today in the carnival lecture of the Institute of Anorganic Chemistry at the Technical University Munich.\n\nHis adventurous life provides input for thematic conducted tours in Munich and Landshut.\n\n"}
{"id": "74910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74910", "title": "Masquerade ball", "text": "Masquerade ball\n\nA masquerade ball (or \"bal masqué\") is an event in which the participants attend in costume wearing a mask. (Compare the word \"masque\"—a formal written and sung court pageant.) Less formal \"costume parties\" may be a descendant of this tradition. A masquerade ball usually encompasses music and dancing. These nighttime events are used for entertainment and celebrations. \n\nMasquerade balls were a feature of the Carnival season in the 15th century, and involved increasingly elaborate allegorical Royal Entries, pageants, and triumphal processions celebrating marriages and other dynastic events of late medieval court life. The \"Bal des Ardents\" (\"Burning Men's Ball\") was held by Charles VI of France, and intended as a \"Bal des sauvages\" (\"Wild Men's Ball\"), a form of costumed ball (\"morisco\"). It took place in celebration of the marriage of a lady-in-waiting of Charles VI of France's queen in Paris on January 28, 1393. The King and five courtiers dressed as wildmen of the woods (woodwoses), with costumes of flax and pitch. When they came too close to a torch, the dancers caught fire. (This episode may have influenced Edgar Allan Poe's short story \"Hop-Frog\".) Such costumed dances were a special luxury of the Ducal Court of Burgundy.\n\nMasquerade balls were extended into costumed public festivities in Italy during the 16th century Renaissance (Italian, \"maschera\"). They were generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, and were particularly popular in Venice. They have been associated with the tradition of the Venetian Carnival. With the fall of the Venetian Republic at the end of the 18th century, the use and tradition of masks gradually began to decline, until they disappeared altogether.\nThey became popular throughout mainland Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, sometimes with fatal results. Gustav III of Sweden was assassinated at a masquerade ball by disgruntled nobleman Jacob Johan Anckarström, an event which Eugène Scribe and Daniel Auber turned into the opera \"Gustave III\". The same event was the basis of Giuseppe Verdi's opera \"A Masked Ball\", although the censors in the original production forced him to portray it as a fictional story set in Boston. Most masks came from countries like Switzerland and Italy.\n\nJohn James Heidegger, a Swiss count who arrived in Italy in 1708, is credited with introducing to London the Venetian fashion of a semi-public masquerade ball, to which one might subscribe, with the first being held at Haymarket Opera House. London's public gardens, like Vauxhall Gardens, refurbished in 1732, and Ranelagh Gardens, provided optimal outdoor settings, where characters masked and in fancy dress mingled with the crowds. The reputation for unseemly behavior, unescorted women and assignations motivated a change of name, to the Venetian \"ridotto\", but as \"The Man of Taste\" observed in 1733;\n\nIn Lent, if masquerades displease the town,<br>\nCall 'em Ridottos and they still go down.\"\n\nA standard item of masquerade dress was a \"Vandyke\", improvised on the costumes worn in the portraits of Van Dyck: Gainsborough's \"Blue Boy\" is the most familiar example, and a reminder of the later 18th-century popularity in England for portraits in fancy dress.\n\nThroughout the century, masquerade dances became popular in Colonial America. Its prominence did not go unchallenged; a significant anti-masquerade movement grew alongside the balls themselves. The anti-masquerade writers (among them such notables as Samuel Richardson) held that the events encouraged immorality and \"foreign influence.\" While they were sometimes able to persuade authorities to their views, particularly after the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, enforcement of measures designed to end masquerades was at best desultory, and the masquerades went on as semi-private \"subscriptions.\" In the 1770s, fashionable Londoners went to the masquerades organized by Teresa Cornelys at Carlisle House in Soho Square, and later to the Pantheon.\n\nMasquerade balls were sometimes set as a game among the guests. The masked guests were supposedly dressed so as to be unidentifiable. This would create a type of game to see if a guest could determine each other's identities. This added a humorous effect to many masquerades and enabled a more enjoyable version of typical balls.\n\nOne of the most noted masquerade balls of the 20th century was that held at Palazzo Labia in Venice on 3 September 1951, hosted by Carlos de Beistegui. It was dubbed \"the party of the century.\"\n\nAnother famous ball was The Black and White Ball. It held on November 28, 1966 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City. Hosted by author Truman Capote, the ball was in honor of The Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham.\n\nMasquerade masks were worn delicately by the prosperous class at balls. Masquerade masks had many uses including hiding one's identity,and using different colour to express one's freedom of speech and voice one's emotions and opinions without judgement. There were two types of base masquerade masks; black masks and white masks. Designs and patterns were created over the base that was chosen. The main types of masks included masks with a stick, the head mask, the full-face mask, and the half face mask. From classics like The Phantom of the Opera and Romeo and Juliet to The Lone Ranger and Gossip Girl, masquerade masks have been, and are still used in many types of media today.\n\nA new resurgence of masquerade balls began in the late 1990s in North America. More recently, the party atmosphere is emphasized and the formal dancing usually less prominent. In present times, masquerade masks are used for costumes during Halloween. Masquerade masks are sold in a wide range of stores in different designs, and colors.\n\nThe picturesque quality of the masquerade ball has made it a favorite topic or setting in literature.\nEdgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Masque of the Red Death\" is based at a masquerade ball in which a central figure turns out to be his costume.\nA ball in Zürich is featured in the novel \"Steppenwolf\" by Hermann Hesse.\nA masquerade ball is central to the plot of Mikhail Lermontov's 1835 play \"Masquerade\". The play was censored and never staged during Lermontov's lifetime, partly because of the implied criticism of the masquerade balls staged by the aristocratic Engelhardt family.\nThe book, musical and most film adaptations of \"The Phantom of the Opera\" have a scene at a masked ball. The Phantom's (Erik's) costume is that of the Red Death from the aforementioned Edgar Allan Poe story \"The Masque of the Red Death\".\nIn the play \"Romeo and Juliet\" by \"Shakespeare\", Romeo meets Juliet at a masquerade ball.\nThe video game \"Dishonored\" has a mission called Lady Boyle's Last Party, taking place at a masquerade where the primary objective is discerning the identity of Lady Boyle, a masked party-goer.\n"}
{"id": "37325133", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37325133", "title": "Motherhood penalty", "text": "Motherhood penalty\n\nThe motherhood penalty is a term coined by sociologists who argue that in the workplace, working mothers encounter systematic disadvantages in pay, perceived competence, and benefits relative to childless women. Specifically, women may suffer a per-child wage penalty, resulting in a pay gap between non-mothers and mothers that is larger than the gap between men and women. Mothers may also suffer worse job-site evaluations indicating that they are less committed to their jobs, less dependable, and less authoritative than non-mothers. Thus, mothers may experience disadvantages in terms of hiring, pay, and daily job experience. The motherhood penalty is not limited to one simple cause but can rather be linked to many theories and societal perceptions. However, one prominent theory that can be consistently liked to this penalty is the work-effort theory. It is also based on the mother's intersectionality. There are many effects developed from the motherhood penalty including wage, hiring, and promotion penalties. These effects are not limited to the United States and have been documented in over a dozen other industrialized nations including Japan, South Korea, The United Kingdom, Poland, and Australia. The penalty has not shown any signs of declining over time.\n\nThe most frequently hypothesized explanation of the motherhood wage penalty is that childbearing and childrearing disrupt formal education and on-the-job training. However, evidence suggests that educational and training differences between mothers and non-mothers do not entirely explain the penalty for motherhood. The wage gap is not a universal percentage across the US. It varies by state and occupation. It is less prominent in teaching and nursing roles, as these are caregiving careers and therefore seen as \"women's work\". However, in construction, for example, the wage gap becomes more drastic and even more so for African American women and Latina women. If these women become mothers, their wage gap become more significant as they are then faced time off of work and barriers in the resources and policies that their company has in place.\n\nWhen compared it is shown that sole mothers experience not only more financial hard ship but they also lack positive psychosocial interaction and social support in the workforce. Sole mothers also experience an increased likely hood of health complications. Sole mothers face more obstacles when sustaining a job due to their increased risk of missing work due to challenges is finding quality, reliable, and affordable child care.\n\nAge plays a large role in the strength of the effects on a mother caused by the motherhood penalty. A study revealed that the effects of motherhood are strong at a younger age and are eventually weakened when the mother reaches her 40s or 50s. Therefore, if a mother chooses to have children at a younger age, her career may be more affected by the penalty than mothers who choose to wait until after their career has been established. Women who have children at the beginning of their careers have to make greater accommodations in their lives such as cutting back on education, taking more time off, and pass up on more promotions. These choices may have a longer lasting effect on the course of a woman's career than having children after being satisfied in a steady job. Having children at a young age reinforces the idea of motherhood as a status of choice and may reflect to an employer that the woman chooses motherhood over a career.\n\nA theoretical claim advanced in the performance expectations and evaluations of workplace competence is that motherhood is a \"status characteristic\". Status characteristic theory defines a status as a categorical distinction among people such as a personal attribute (e.g., race, gender, physical attractiveness) or role (e.g., motherhood, manager, level of education), that has a cultural understanding or belief attached to it. Status characteristics associate greater status worthiness and competence in some distinctions than with others, and they become notable when the characteristic is believed to be directly relevant to the task at hand.\n\nThe theoretical construct linking status characteristics, such as race or gender, to differences in behaviors and evaluations is \"performance expectations\". According to this theory, people implicitly expect more competent task performances from those with more valued status characteristics, and as a result, the people expected to offer more competent performances are evaluated more positively and are given more opportunities. The central idea of the theory and empirical research is that ability standards are stricter for those with lower performance expectations or devalued status characteristics. Since performances of lower status actors (mothers) are critically scrutinized, even when \"objectively\" equal to that of their high-status counterparts (non-mothers), they are less likely to be judged as competent in demonstrating task ability.\n\nStatus characteristics Theory claims that the standard used to evaluate workers is systematically biased in favor of high-status groups. If motherhood is a devalued status in the setting of a workplace, mothers will be judged with harsher standards than non-mothers; therefore, will have to present greater evidence of their competence.\n\nDiscrimination against mothers also stems from beliefs about control, choice, and autonomy. The concept of choice leads people to perceive disadvantaged individuals as responsible for their own condition, regardless of the social circumstances or unfair application of the disadvantage. In the context of discrimination against mothers in the workforce, beliefs about choice and control affect the penalties associated with becoming a mother. In the past, most women eventually became mothers. Today, more and more women are not becoming mothers largely due to the pursuit of career aspirations and educational goals by women. Therefore, motherhood is increasingly viewed as a choice that women have the freedom to make. Since motherhood is seen as a choice, employers view mothers as choosing children over their work. When a situation, such as motherhood, is perceived as controllable, the moral judgment associated with that perception leads to discrimination. Consequently, mothers who are perceived as having more control over their status as mothers are penalized more than mothers who are perceived as having less control. An experiment done on hiring practices showed that mothers are discriminated against more strongly, in terms of hiring and salary recommendations, when understandings of choice were primed.\n\nNormative discrimination stems from descriptive and prescriptive stereotyping. Descriptive stereotypes are widely shared beliefs about different traits and abilities men and women possess. Due to descriptive stereotypes, men are assumed to be intelligent and assertive, which are qualities often associated with leadership and workplace achievement. Women are assumed to possess greater communal qualities and helping behavior such as warmth, empathy, and selflessness. Discrimination based on descriptive stereotypes occurs when women are seen as unfit or insufficiently competent to perform a stereotypical male job. While descriptive stereotypes influence beliefs about what men and women can do, prescriptive and proscriptive stereotypes influence beliefs about what men and women should or should not do to follow societal norms. The expectations of an ideal employee and an ideal parent are influenced from the past when men composed the majority of the workforce while women were often confined to household duties and childcare. Benard and Correll conducted a study that found mothers are still currently discriminated against even when they prove their competence and commitment. They discovered that evaluators viewed highly successful mothers as less warm and more interpersonally hostile than comparable workers who are not mothers. Stereotypical gender role expectations cause many challenges for mothers who are reentering the workplace. Due to the fact that women are thought of as more caring, they are often expected to be the primary caregiver. When women break this stereotype, they are liked less because they are violating the prescriptive stereotypes about women as mothers.\n\nMothers in the American culture are impacted by normative social influence leading them to believe that they are supposed to prioritize the needs of dependent children above all other activities. By this definition, a \"good mother\" will direct all of her time and energy toward her child, and therefore be a less committed and less productive worker. The cultural norm that mothers should always be there for their children coexist in tension with the normative belief of the \"ideal worker\" should always be there for his or her employer. These normative conceptions of an \"ideal worker\" and a \"good mother\" create a cultural tension between the motherhood role and the committed worker role. These conflicting roles can lead employers to engage in normative discrimination, in which they recognize the competence of mothers but believe that it is their duty to remain at home with their children. This perception of mothers penalizes them on two of the three interpersonal ratings, being seen as less likable and warm compared to their non-mother and father peers in the workplace.\n\nThis is the most prominent theory seen across all research done on this topic. This is another possible explanation of the motherhood penalty. The work-effort theory concentrates on the productivity of the workers. This approach states that the wage penalty faced by mothers may be due to actual productivity differences between mothers and non-mothers. Productivity differences can occur if taking care of children leaves mothers with less energy to exert at work. Additionally, mothers may also be less productive at work because they are saving their energy for their \"second shift\" at home. Lower wages for women with children may reflect the choices made by mothers, like trading more flexible hours for lower wages. However, it also may reflect employer bias and discrimination. For example, the difference in how employers handle benefit packages and full-time work requirements.\n\nThe effects of motherhood penalty can be more or less severe on a mother depending on the variables of how old the mother is and also how many children the mother is raising. Younger mothers who are just entering the work force may suffer more severe consequences that older mothers who have already contributed to the work force. Women who have more children are also more likely to have to sacrifice more in their work lives and therefore leave themselves open to suffer greater career setbacks related to the motherhood penalty. The motherhood penalty can cause an negative impact of working women's health due to their expectation to be the primary care giver at home for their children and the stress of proving themselves as dedicated at work and producing quality work. The motherhood penalty describes how mothers suffer severe wage and hiring disadvantages in the workplace. The status of motherhood has important ramifications on hiring, promotion, and salary processes. Depending on their status, studies have found that under the age of 35, the wage gap between mothers and non-mothers was even larger than the wage gap between men and women.\n\nMotherhood penalty is significant to the gender wage gap because studies found that employed mothers are the women that account for most of the gender wage gap. Research shows that hourly wages of mothers are approximately 5% lower (per child) than the wages of non-mothers. TheResearch by Sigle-Rushton and Waldfogel found that 81% of mothers with children under the age of 18 made less than $40,000 per year compared to only 44% of fathers wage penalty incurred by women for motherhood varies significantly across nations as do work-family policies. Therefore, it is unclear if variations in motherhood wage penalties are linked to specific work-family policies. Women in lower wage jobs suffer a greater percentage of loss in hourly wages as a result of motherhood than women in more highly paid professions. \n\nMothers are less likely to get hired than non-mothers. Correll, Benard, and Paik created a study that looked at the hiring practices and preferences of employers. Through the evaluation of hypothetical resumes from two applicant profiles that were functionally equivalent. Their resumes were both very strong and when presenting these resumes, no one preferred one applicant over the other and they were seen as equally qualified. Next, a memo mentioning that the applicant was a mother of two children was added to one of the profiles. When participants were asked if they would hire these applicants, participants said they would hire 84 percent of the women without children, compared with only 47 percent of the mothers. These findings showed that mothers are 79 percent less likely to be hired. Participants offered non-mothers an average of $11,000 more than mothers. An audit study also showed that prospective employers were less likely to call back mothers for interviews than non-mothers.\n\nIn another experiment, participants evaluated application materials for a pair of same race, same gender job applicants who were equally qualified but differed on parental status. Relative to other kinds of applicants, mothers were rated as less competent, less committed, less suitable for hire, promotion, and management training, and deserving of lower salaries. Mothers were also held to higher performance and punctuality standards. The study results showed that mothers are 100% less likely to be promoted because mothers are assumed to be less competent and committed than women without children.\n\nSeveral recent studies have shown a wage penalty against maternity leave in the United States. Men do not suffer this penalty. Men's wages are either unaffected or even increase after having a child. A study by a Stanford sociologist Shelley Correll found that employers perceived mothers as less competent than childless women, and also perceived childless men as less competent and committed than men who were fathers. In fact, the researcher found that fathers are 1.83 times more likely to be recommended for management than childless men, a difference that is marginally significant. For female applicants, childless women are 8.2 times more likely than mothers to be recommended for management This difference between mothers and fathers is partly due to cultural norms about gender roles and mechanisms present in the market that create disadvantages for mothers from reduced bargaining power or employer discrimination.\n\nThere have been many welfare policies that attempt to resolve the effects of the motherhood penalty. Reconciliation policies include policies such as paid or unpaid parental and family leave, childcare policies supporting subsidized or state-provided care, and flexible work-time policies. Reconciliation policies aimed at improving economic opportunity and equality of mothers should focus on lifting the time constraints on women and changing social norms of gender roles. Theoretically, work-family reconciliation policies should give mothers (and fathers) the opportunity to advance in the workplace, while also ensuring that their families receive adequate care. While all reconciliation policies may support work-family balance, these policies draw upon different assumptions about women's roles in society, and therefore may lead to diverse outcomes regarding equity.\n\nAn alternative to welfare policies is a fundamental rights approach, where a child holds the fundamental constitutional right to both care and financial support from both parents on an equal basis, unless the parents expressly agree otherwise (or adoptive parent(s) assume such responsibilities). As paternity has become more and more inexpensive to prove and as more and more evidence comes in on the benefits to children from shared earning/shared parenting, the fundamental rights approach is gaining more credence and becoming easier to establish as a legal matter. One example of this is the United Kingdom, which has a parental responsibility concept in the law that requires parents to meet the needs of children, such as a right to a home and a right to be maintained. The law does not see children as having a right to care by both biological parents as a default matter. Instead it holds responsible all mothers but only (a) married fathers (for any child born to the father's wife) and (b) unmarried fathers who assert such responsibility in an agreement with the mother or by court order. It also states that all parents have financial responsibility for their children. The law has not been amended since paternity testing became more inexpensive.\n\nJoya Misra, Michelle Budig and Stephanie Moller did a study looking at the consequences of these different welfare strategies. The study focuses on welfare state regime strategies with an emphasis on work/family reconciliation policies meant to help men and women reconcile their roles as workers and parents. The study looks at the effects of these strategies on labor force participation rates, wage rates, and poverty rates, analyzing the effects of motherhood and marital status on labor force participation rates, annual earnings, and poverty rates. They argue that four major strategies that have appeared:\n\n\nThe study suggests that the earner-carer strategy is most effective at increasing equity for the widest array of women. In this strategy, motherhood is associated with the least negative effects on employment, as well as on poverty levels. The researchers do acknowledge that a range of other policies such as tax policies, unemployment insurance, family allowances, child support, housing subsidies could also be shaping the outcomes.\n\nLeave policies are intended to support parental care giving while enabling employment continuity. Leave length impacts employers' perceptions of mothers' employability and mothers' earnings. Moderate leaves reduce pay gaps by ensuring women remain attached to their workplace while children are infants; however, leaves that are too short or too long increase pay gaps because they are linked to decreases in employment continuity and earnings.\n\n\n\n"}

She was featured in Ogonyok magazine and many other major Soviet publications during the war. Komsomolskaya Pravda featured her portrait in a March issue after she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 23 February 1945 for completing 737 sorties.\n\nPopova was born in Shabanovka (Orlovskaya oblast), Russia, on 17 December 1921. Daughter of a railwayman, she grew up near the Donetsk coal fields in Ukraine. As an adolescent, she loved music, song, and dance, taking part in amateur plays and musicals, dreaming of becoming an actress. \"The Economist\" reported that she was a \"wild spirit, easily bored; she loved to tango, foxtrot, sing along to jazz. It made her feel free.\" When a small aircraft landed near her village, she became enamored with aviation, enrolling in a gliding school at the age of 15 without telling her parents. \"Walking towards a plane, every time, she would get a knot in her stomach; every time she took off, she was thrilled all over again.\"\n\nIn 1937, she made both her first parachute jump and her first solo flight at the age of sixteen. Despite her parents' opposition, she pursued her new passion and obtained her flying license.\n\nShe was initially rejected as a student by a pilot school, but after Polina Osipenko, the Inspector for Aviation in the Moscow Military District, recommended her, she was allowed to enroll in the Kherson flight school, graduating at the age of eighteen and becoming a flight instructor.\n\nPopova volunteered to be a military pilot, but the government initially barred women from combat and turned her away. But in October 1941, Joseph Stalin caved in to pressure from Marina Raskova and permitted the creation of three women's aviation regiments.\n\nPopova, whose brother Leonid had been killed at the front in 1941 and whose home had been taken by invading German troops, was sent by Marina Raskova to Engels to join other women being trained to become military pilots. She then joined a night bombing regiment, and rose to command the 2nd Women's Regiment (1941–45), flying the Polikarpov Po-2, a bi-plane used as a crop duster before the war. The Women's Regiment flew exclusively at night; their planes, which were not equipped with guns, radios, radar, or parachutes, would incinerate immediately if hit with even minimal ordnance. \n\nOn 10 March 1942, during a training mission, Popova was leading a formation when two aircraft got lost in a heavy blizzard and crashed, killing their all-female crews. These were the first casualties sustained by her unit. After training, she was sent to fight in her childhood home region of the Donetsk coal fields. The regiment was called \"Nachthexen\" (Night Witches) by the Germans \"because the whooshing noise their plywood and canvas airplanes made reminded the Germans of the sound of a witch’s broomstick.\"\n\nPopova was shot down several times in the three years she spent fighting, but was never badly wounded. On 2 August 1942, she was on a day reconnaissance mission when she was attacked by Luftwaffe fighters and forced to make an emergency landing near Cherkessk. Trying to return to her unit, she joined a motorized column, and among the wounded met her future husband, fighter pilot Semyon Kharlamov, who was reading \"And Quiet Flows the Don\".\n\nShe later flew a relief mission through enemy fire over Novorossiysk, dropping food, water and medical supplies to the forces trapped in Malaya Zemlya, nearly not making it. After returning, she found her aircraft riddled with bullet holes, right down to her map and helmet.\n\nAs the Axis forces began their retreat, Popova's unit followed the front through Belarus and Poland and eventually entered Germany. It was in Poland that she reached her personal record of 18 sorties in one night. In total, Popova completed 852 sorties in the war.\n\nThe 46th Guards Night Bomber Regiment was dissolved in October 1945, and Popova returned to her town to a hero's welcome, complete with marching band and flowers thrown over her car. She was driven to the theatre, where 2,000 people were waiting for her, among them one of the marines she had helped in Malaya Zemlya.\n\nShe married soon after the war - her husband went on to attain the rank of colonel general in the Soviet Air Force, and her son Aleksandr is a graduate of the Air Academy - and she worked as a flight instructor for almost two decades. Popova was widowed in 1990.\n\nPopova died on 8 July 2013 at the age of 91.\n\n\n\n"}

It states clearly that actions which involve helping an enemy state against India are strongly condemned. It also states that one cannot approach, inspect, or even pass over a prohibited government site or area. According to this Act, helping the enemy state can be in the form of communicating a sketch, plan, model of an official secret, or of official codes or passwords, to the enemy.\n\nPunishments under the Act range from three to fourteen years imprisonment. A person prosecuted under this Act can be charged with the crime even if the action was unintentional and not intended to endanger the security of the state. The Act only empowers persons in positions of authority to handle official secrets, and others who handle it in prohibited areas or outside them are liable for punishment. \n\nJournalists have to help members of the police forces above the rank of the sub-Inspector and members of the military with investigation regarding an offense, up to and including revealing his sources of information.\n\nUnder the Act, search warrants may be issued at any time if the magistrate determines that based on the evidence there is enough danger to the security of the state.\n\nUninterested members of the public may be excluded from court proceedings if the prosecution feels that any information which is going to be passed on during the proceedings is sensitive. This also includes media.\n\nWhen a company is seen as the offender under this Act, everyone involved with the management of the company, including the board of directors, can be liable for punishment. In the case of a newspaper, everyone – including the editor, publisher and the proprietor — can be imprisoned for an offense.\nOSA is controversial to the modern RTI act 2005.\n\nIn the OSA clause 6, information from any governmental office is considered official information, hence it can be used to override Right to Information Act 2005 requests. This has drawn harsh criticism.\n\nIn June 2002, journalist Iftikhar Gilani was, arrested for violating the OSA 1923. He was charged under the OSA, with a case under the Obscenity Act added to it. The first military report suggested that the information he was accused of holding was \"secret\" despite being publicly available. The second military intelligence report contradicted this, stating that there was no \"official secret\". Even after this, the government denied the opinion of the military and was on the verge of challenging it when the contradictions were exposed in the press.\n\nThe military reported that, \"the information contained in the document is easily available\" and \"the documents carries no security classified information and the information seems to have been gathered from open sources\".\n\nOn 13 January 2004, the government withdrew its case against him to prevent having two of its ministries having to give contradictory opinions. Gilani was released the same month.\n\nAfter reviewing the provisions of the act, the Union Home Ministry in July 2017 submitted a report to the Cabinet secretariat. The goal was to amend the act to make it more transparent and in line with the Right to Information Act, 2005. \n\nA Delhi court in a 2009 judgement, in a case involving the publication of excerpts of a cabinet note in the Financial Express ten years earlier by Santanu Saikia, greatly reduced the powers of the act by ruling publication of a document merely labelled \"secret\" shall not render the journalist liable under the law. \n\nSaikia was arrested in February, 2015 in another case that the police said involved the writing of stories and analyses from documents allegedly stolen from the government. He was released on bail in May after spending 80 days in jail.\n\n50 cases of violation of the Official Secrets Act were registered in the country since 2014. Of these 50 cases, 30 were registered in 2016, nine in 2015 and 11 in 2014 according to Union Minister of state for Home Hansraj Ahir. Of the 30 cases registered in 2014, eight were lodged in Tamil Nadu, followed by five each in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. \n\n"}

{"id": "22655", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22655", "title": "Ossian", "text": "Ossian\n\nOssian (; Irish Gaelic/Scottish Gaelic: \"Oisean\") is the narrator and purported author of a cycle of epic poems published by the Scottish poet James Macpherson from 1760. Macpherson claimed to have collected word-of-mouth material in Scottish Gaelic, said to be from ancient sources, and that the work was his translation of that material. Ossian is based on Oisín, son of Finn or Fionn mac Cumhaill, anglicised to Finn McCool, a legendary bard who is a character in Irish mythology. Contemporary critics were divided in their view of the work's authenticity, but the consensus since is that Macpherson framed the poems himself, based on old folk tales he had collected.\n\nThe work was internationally popular, translated into all the literary languages of Europe and was highly influential both in the development of the Romantic movement and the Gaelic revival. \"The contest over the authenticity of Macpherson's pseudo-Gaelic productions,\" Curley asserts, \"became a seismograph of the fragile unity within restive diversity of imperial Great Britain in the age of Johnson.\" Macpherson's fame was crowned by his burial among the literary giants in Westminster Abbey. W.P. Ker, in the \"Cambridge History of English Literature\", observes that \"all Macpherson's craft as a philological impostor would have been nothing without his literary skill.\"\n\nIn 1760 Macpherson published the English-language text \"Fragments of ancient poetry, collected in the Highlands of Scotland, and translated from the Gaelic or Erse language\". Later that year, he claimed to have obtained further manuscripts and in 1761 he claimed to have found an epic on the subject of the hero Fingal, written by Ossian. The name Fingal or \"Fionnghall\" means \"white stranger\". According to Macpherson's prefatory material, his publisher, claiming that there was no market for these works except in English, required that they be translated. Macpherson published these translations during the next few years, culminating in a collected edition, \"The Works of Ossian\", in 1765. The most famous of these Ossianic poems was \"Fingal\", written in 1762.\n\nThe supposed original poems are translated into poetic prose, with short and simple sentences. The mood is epic, but there is no single narrative, although the same characters reappear. The main characters are Ossian himself, relating the stories when old and blind, his father Fingal (very loosely based on the Irish hero Fionn mac Cumhaill), his dead son Oscar (also with an Irish counterpart), and Oscar's lover Malvina (like Fiona a name invented by Macpherson), who looks after Ossian in his old age. Though the stories \"are of endless battles and unhappy loves\", the enemies and causes of strife are given little explanation and context.\n\nCharacters are given to killing loved ones by mistake, and dying of grief, or of joy. There is very little information given on the religion, culture or society of the characters, and buildings are hardly mentioned. The landscape \"is more real than the people who inhabit it. Drowned in eternal mist, illuminated by a decrepit sun or by emphemeral meteors, it is a world of greyness.\" Fingal is king of a region of south-west Scotland perhaps similar to the historical kingdom of Dál Riata and the poems appear to be set around the 3rd century, with the \"king of the world\" mentioned being the Roman Emperor; Macpherson and his supporters detected references to Caracalla (d. 217, as \"Caracul\") and Carausius (d. 293, as \"Caros\", the \"king of ships\").\n\nThe poems achieved international success. Napoleon and Diderot were great admirers, and Voltaire wrote parodies of them. Thomas Jefferson thought Ossian \"the greatest poet that has ever existed\", and planned to learn Gaelic so as to read his poems in the original. They were proclaimed as a Celtic equivalent of the Classical writers such as Homer. Many writers were influenced by the works, including Walter Scott, and painters and composers chose Ossianic subjects.\n\nOne poem was translated into French in 1762, and by 1777 the whole \"corpus\". In the German-speaking states Michael Denis made the first full translation in 1768–69, inspiring the proto-nationalist poets Klopstock and Goethe, whose own German translation of a portion of Macpherson's work figures prominently in a climactic scene of \"The Sorrows of Young Werther\" (1774). Goethe's associate Johann Gottfried Herder wrote an essay titled \"Extract from a correspondence about Ossian and the Songs of Ancient Peoples\" (1773) in the early days of the Sturm und Drang movement.\n\nComplete Danish translations were made in 1790, and Swedish ones in 1794–1800. In Scandinavia and Germany the Celtic nature of the setting was ignored or not understood, and Ossian was regarded as a Nordic or Germanic figure who became a symbol for nationalist aspirations. The French general Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, who was made King Charles XIV John of Sweden and King of Norway, had already named his only son after a character from Ossian, at the suggestion of Napoleon, the child's godfather and an admirer of Ossian;. Born in 1799, Bernadotte's son later became King Oscar I of Sweden and Norway, and was succeeded by his son Oscar II (d. 1907). \"Oscar\" being a Royal Swedish name led to its becoming also a common male first name, especially in Scandinavia but also in other European countries.\n\nMelchiore Cesarotti was an Italian clergyman whose translation into Italian is said by many to improve on the original, and was a tireless promoter of the poems, in Vienna and Warsaw as well as Italy. It was his translation that Napoleon especially admired, and among others it influenced Ugo Foscolo who was Cesarotti's pupil in the University of Padua.\n\nBy 1800 Ossian was translated into Spanish and Russian, with Dutch following in 1805, and Polish, Czech and Hungarian in 1827–33. The poems were as much admired in Hungary as in France and Germany; Hungarian János Arany wrote \"Homer and Ossian\" in response, and several other Hungarian writers – Baróti Szabó, Csokonai, Sándor Kisfaludy, Kazinczy, Kölcsey, Ferenc Toldy, and Ágost Greguss, were also influenced by it.\n\nThe first partial Polish translation of Ossian was made by Ignacy Krasicki in 1793. The complete translation appeared in 1838 by Seweryn Goszczyński. The most influential Russian version of Ossian was the 1792 translation by Ermil Kostrov, who based his work on Pierre Le Tourneur's 1777 translation from the original.\n\nThe opera \"Ossian, ou Les bardes\" by Le Sueur (with the famous, multimedial scene of „Ossian's Dream“) was a sell-out at the Paris Opera in 1804, and transformed the composer's career. The poems also exerted an influence on the burgeoning of Romantic music, and Franz Schubert in particular composed Lieder setting many of Ossian's poems. In 1829 Felix Mendelssohn was inspired to visit the Hebrides and composed the \"Hebrides Overture\", better known as \"Fingal's Cave\". His friend Niels Gade devoted his first published work, the concert overture \"Efterklange af Ossian\" (\"Echoes of Ossian\") written in 1840, to the same subject.\n\nOf all the admirers of Macpherson’s Ossian, perhaps one of those most qualified to judge its poetic quality (as opposed to the question of its authenticity) was the great Hungarian national poet Sándor Petőfi. He went so far as to write a poem entitled \"Homer and Ossian\", of which the first verse reads:\n\n<poem>\n\"Oh where are you Hellenes and Celts?\n\"Already you have vanished, like\n\"Two cities drowning\n\"In the waters of the deep.\n\"Only the tips of towers stand out from the water,\n\"Two tips of towers: Homer, Ossian.</poem>\n\nLikewise, William Wordsworth was evidently positively impressed by Macpherson's text when he wrote his poem \"Glen-Almain, the Narrow Glen\":\n\n<poem>\n\"In this still place, remote from men,\n\"Sleeps Ossian, in the Narrow Glen;\n\"In this still place, where murmurs on\n\"But one meek streamlet, only one:\n\"He sang of battles, and the breath\n\"Of stormy war, and violent death;\n\"And should, methinks, when all was past,\n\"Have rightfully be laid at last\n\"Where rocks were rudely heap'd, and rent\n\"As by a spirit turbulent;\n\"Where sights were rough, and sounds were wild,\n\"And everything unreconciled;\n\"In some complaining dim retreat,\n\"For fear and melancholy meet;\n\"But this is calm; there cannot be\n\"A more entire tranquility.</poem>\n<poem>\n\"Does then the bard sleep here indeed?\n\"Or is it but a groundless creed?\n\"What matters it? – I blame them not\n\"Whose fancy in this lonely spot\n\"Was moved; and in such way express'd\n\"Their notion of its perfect rest.\n\"A convent, even a hermit's cell,\n\"Would break the silence of this Dell:\n\"It is not quiet, is not ease;\n\"But something deeper far than these:\n\"The separation that is here\n\"Is of the grave; and of austere\n\"Yet happy feelings of the dead:\n\"And therefore, was it rightly said\n\"That Ossian, last of all his race!\n\"Lies buried in this lonely place.</poem>\n\nThere were immediate disputes of Macpherson's claims on both literary and political grounds. Macpherson promoted a Scottish origin for the material, and was hotly opposed by Irish historians who felt that their heritage was being appropriated. However, both Scotland and Ireland shared a common Gaelic culture during the period in which the poems are set, and some Fenian literature common in both countries was composed in Scotland.\n\nSamuel Johnson, English author, critic, and biographer, was convinced that Macpherson was \"a mountebank, a liar, and a fraud, and that the poems were forgeries\". Johnson also dismissed the poems' quality. Upon being asked, \"But Doctor Johnson, do you really believe that any man today could write such poetry?\" he famously replied, \"Yes. Many men. Many women. And many children.\" Johnson is cited as calling the story of Ossian \"as gross an imposition as ever the world was troubled with\". In support of his claim, Johnson also called Gaelic the rude speech of a barbarous people, and said there were no manuscripts in it more than 100 years old. In reply, it was proved that the Advocates' library at Edinburgh contained Gaelic manuscripts 500 years old, and one of even greater antiquity.\n\nScottish author Hugh Blair's 1763 \"A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian\" upheld the work's authenticity against Johnson's scathing criticism and from 1765 was included in every edition of \"Ossian\" to lend the work credibility. The work also had a timely resonance for those swept away by the emerging Romantic movement and the theory of the \"noble savage\", and it echoed the popularity of Burke's seminal \"A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful\" (1757).\n\nIn 1766 the Irish antiquarian and Gaelic scholar Charles O'Conor dismissed Ossian's authenticity in a new chapter \"Remarks on Mr. Mac Pherson's translation of Fingal and Temora\" that he added to the second edition of his seminal history. In 1775 he expanded his criticism in a new book, \"Dissertation on the origin and antiquities of the antient Scots\".\n\nFaced with the controversy, the Committee of the Highland Society enquired after the authenticity of Macpherson's supposed original. It was because of these circumstances that the so-called Glenmasan manuscript (Adv. 72.2.3) came to light in the late 18th century, a compilation which contains the tale \"Oided mac n-Uisnig\". This text is a version of the Irish \"Longes mac n-Uislenn\" and offers a tale which bears some comparison to Macpherson's \"Darthula\", although it is radically different in many respects. Donald Smith cited it in his report for the Committee.\n\nThe controversy raged on into the early years of the 19th century, with disputes as to whether the poems were based on Irish sources, on sources in English, on Gaelic fragments woven into his own composition as Johnson concluded, or largely on Scots Gaelic oral traditions and manuscripts as Macpherson claimed. Defences of the authenticity of the poems continued to be made. For example, Peter Hately Waddell argued in \"Ossian and the Clyde\" (1875) that poems contained topographical references that could not have been known to Macpherson.\n\nIn 1952, the Scottish literary scholar Derick Thomson investigated the sources for Macpherson's work and concluded that Macpherson had collected genuine Scottish Gaelic ballads, employing scribes to record those that were preserved orally and collating manuscripts, but had adapted them by altering the original characters and ideas, and had introduced a great deal of his own.\n\nPerhaps the strongest evidence that Macpherson's 'Ossian' was not a total fabrication is to be found in the oldest extant Scottish manuscript in Gaelic known as the \"Book of the Dean of Lismore\" (1512). In the section of this manuscript which consists of heroic poetry and includes verse from as early as AD 1310, we find the names and exploits of almost all the leading protagonists in Macpherson's text (Cairbe, Caoilte, Conán, Cormac mac Airt, Cú Chulainn, Diarmad, Eimhear, Fionn mac Cumhaill, Goll mac Morna, Osgar mac Oiséin, Tréanmhor, etc.), together with legends and traditions associated with these characters. (See 'Heroic Poetry from the Book of the Dean of Lismore'. Neil Ross, editor. Scottish Gaelic Texts Society, Edinburgh, 1939.)\n\nMacpherson’s \"Ossian\" made a strong impression on Dugald Buchanan (1716–68), a Perthshire poet whose celebrated \"Spiritual Hymns\" are written in a Scots Gaelic of a high quality that to some extent reflects the language of the classical Gaelic common to the bards of both Ireland and Scotland. Buchanan, taking the poems of \"Ossian\" to be authentic, was moved to revalue the genuine traditions and rich cultural heritage of the Gaels. At around the same time, he wrote to Sir James Clerk of Penicuik, the leading antiquary of the movement, proposing that someone should travel to the Isles and Western Coast of Scotland and collect the work of the ancient and modern bards, in which alone he could find the language in its purity.\n\nMuch later, in the 19th and 20th centuries, this task was taken up by collectors such as Alexander Carmichael and Lady Evelyn Stewart Murray, and to be recorded and continued by the work of the School of Scottish Studies and the Scottish Gaelic Texts Society. It can perhaps be claimed, therefore, that the effect made on Dugald Buchanan by his reading of Macpherson’s \"Ossian\" led eventually to the availability of printed books in Gaelic (other than solely religious material) from the later years of the 19th century, and to the emergence of a mature body of literature in the 20th and 21st.\n\nSubjects from the Ossian poems were popular in the art of northern Europe, but at rather different periods depending on the country; by the time French artists began to depict Ossian, British artists had largely dropped him. Ossian was especially popular in Danish art, but also found in Germany and the rest of Scandinavia.\n\nBritish artists began to depict the Ossian poems early on, with the first major work a cycle of paintings decorating the ceiling the \"Grand Hall\" of Penicuik House in Midlothian, built by Sir James Clerk, who commissioned the paintings in 1772. These were by the Scottish painter Alexander Runciman and lost when the house burnt down in 1899, though drawings and etchings survive, and two pamphlets describing them were published in the 18th century. A subject from Ossian by Angelica Kauffman was shown in the Royal Academy exhibition of 1773, and Ossian was depicted in \"Elysium\", part of the Irish painter James Barry's \"magnum opus\" decorating the Royal Society of Arts, at the Adelphi Buildings in London (still \"in situ\").\n\nWorks on paper by Thomas Girtin and John Sell Cotman have survived, though the Ossianic landscapes by George Augustus Wallis, which the Ossian fan August Wilhelm Schlegel praised in a letter to Goethe, seem to have been lost, as has a picture by J.M.W. Turner exhibited in 1802. Henry Singleton exhibited paintings, some of which were engraved and used in editions of the poems.\n\nA fragment by Novalis, written in 1789, refers to Ossian as an inspired, holy and poetical singer.\n\nThe Danish painter Nicolai Abildgaard, Director of the Copenhagen Academy from 1789, painted several scenes from Ossian, as did his pupils including Asmus Jacob Carstens. His friend Joseph Anton Koch painted a number of subjects, and two large series of illustrations for the poems, which never got properly into print; like many Ossianic works by Wallis, Carstens, Krafft and others, some of these were painted in Rome, perhaps not the best place to evoke the dim northern light of the poems. In Germany the request in 1804 to produce some drawings as illustrations so excited Philipp Otto Runge that he planned a series of 100, far more than asked for, in a style heavily influenced by the linear illustrations of John Flaxman; these remain as drawings only. Many other German works are recorded, some as late as the 1840s; word of the British scepticism over the Ossian poems was slow to pentetrate the continent, or considered irrelevant.\n\nIn France the enthusiasm of Napoleon for the poems accounts for most artistic depictions, and those by the most famous artists, but a painting exhibited in the Paris Salon in 1800 by Paul Duqueylar (now Musée Granet, Aix-en-Provence) excited \"Les Barbus\" (\"the Bearded Ones\") a group of primitivist artists including Pierre-Maurice Quays (or Quaï) who promoted living in the style of \"early civilizations as described in Homer, Ossian, and the Bible\". Quays is reported as saying: \"Homère? Ossian? ... le soleil? la lune? Voilà la question. En vérité, je crois que je préfère la lune. C'est plus simple, plus grand, plus \"primitif\"\". (\"Homer? Ossian? ... the sun? the moon? That's the question. Truthfully I think I prefer the moon. It's more simple, more grand, more \"primitive\"\"). The same year Napoleon was planning the renovation of the Château de Malmaison as a summer palace, and though he does not seem to have suggested Ossianic subjects for his painters, two large and significant works were among those painted for the reception hall, for which six artists had been commissioned.\n\nThese were Girodet's painting of 1801–02 \"Ossian receiving the Ghosts of the French Heroes\", and \"Ossian Evoking ghosts on the Edge of the Lora\" (1801), by François Pascal Simon Gérard. Gérard's original was lost in a shipwreck after being bought by the King of Sweden after the fall of Napoleon, but survives in three replicas by the artist (a further one in Berlin was lost in 1945). One is now at Malmaison (184.5 × 194.5 cm / 72.6 × 76.6 in), and the Kunsthalle Hamburg has another (180,5 × 198,5 cm). A watercolour copy by Jean-Baptiste Isabey was placed as frontispiece to Napoleon's copy of the poems.\n\nDuqueylar, Girodet and Gérard, like Johann Peter Krafft (above) and most of the \"Barbus\", were all pupils of David, and the clearly unclassical subjects of the Ossian poems were useful for emergent French Romantic painting, marking a revolt against David's Neoclassical choice of historical subject-matter. David's recorded reactions to the paintings were guarded or hostile; he said of Girodet's work: \"Either Girodet is mad or I no longer know anything of the art of painting\".\n\nGirodet's painting (still at Malmaison; 192.5 x 184 cm) was a \"success de scandale\" when exhibited in 1802, and remains a key work in the emergence of French Romantic painting, but the specific allusions to the political situation that he intended it to carry were largely lost on the public, and overtaken by the Peace of Amiens with Great Britain, signed in 1802 between the completion and exhibition of the work. He also produced \"Malvina dying in the arms of Fingal\" (c. 1802), and other works.\n\nAnother pupil of David, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, was to depict Ossianic scenes over most of his long career. He made a drawing in 1809, when studying in Rome, and in 1810 or 1811 was commisissioned to make two paintings, the \"Dream of Ossian\" and a classical scene, to decorate the bedroom Napoleon was to occupy in the Palazzo Quirinale on a visit to Rome. In fact the visit never came off and in 1835 Ingres repurchased the work, now in poor condition.\n\nNational Library of Scotland has 327 books and associated materials in its Ossian Collection. The collection was originally assembled by J. Norman Methven of Perth and includes different editions and translations of James Macpherson's epic poem 'Ossian', some with a map of the 'Kingdom of Connor'. It also contains secondary material relating to Ossianic poetry and the Ossian controversy. More than 200 items from the collection have been digitised.\n\nBelow are some other online editions of interest and recent works:\n\n\nin French:\n\n"}
{"id": "16364316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16364316", "title": "Paz Sin Fronteras", "text": "Paz Sin Fronteras\n\nPaz Sin Fronteras () was a benefit concert on March 16, 2008, on the Simón Bolívar Bridge, which borders Colombia and Venezuela, to celebrate the end of the Andean diplomatic crisis a week earlier at the Rio Group summit. Approximately 300,000 people attended the concert.\n\nPaz Sin Fronteras II was a benefit concert headlined by Juanes on September 20, 2009, in Plaza de la Revolución, Havana, Cuba. More than 1.15 million people attended the all-star concert made up of many of the top Latin pop, rock and salsa stars from Latin America, Europe, Puerto Rico and Cuba. \n\n\nThe concert was broadcast live on several television networks throughout the Americas. It was broadcast on Caracol and RCN in Colombia and on Venevisión, RCTV Internacional and Globovisión in Venezuela. It was also broadcast on A&E in Latin America and on Univisión in the United States.\n\nColombian president Álvaro Uribe cancelled his attendance at the concert by request of Fernán Martínez, Juanes' manager, who communicated to his office that the concert was intended to have a neutral agenda instead of a political one.\n\nColombian singer-songwriter Shakira was invited to perform at the concert, but she could not attend because of a busy schedule. However, she stated a press release saying that she would wear white on March 16 as a form to demonstrate her sympathy for \"Paz Sin Fronteras\".\n\nThe message of the concert, according to U.S. representative Jim McGovern, was to circumvent politicians, and using the medium of music, speak directly to young people and encourage them to think in fresh ways — to change their way of thinking — and leave behind the old politics, the old hatreds, prejudices and national enmities that have locked too many people into patterns of conflict, violence, poverty and despair, dividing them from one another. It was an attempt to break down barriers and ask people to join in common purpose.\n\n\nThe concert was transmitted live on the Hispanic Information and Telecommunications Network (HITN) and was also acknowledged by U.S. representative Jim McGovern in the House of Representatives during morning-hour debate on September 22, 2009 which was broadcast on C-SPAN.\nMany of the 1.5 million patrons wore white to symbolize peace. The BBC's Michael Voss, who was at the five-and-a-half hour concert, said there was a mood of excitement as many residents of the isolated, music-loving island had never seen anything like it before.\n\nBoth the United States and Cuban governments helped facilitate the concert, including providing Juanes and his company of 15 international and Cuban artists full control over message and staging. The Departments of State, Treasury and Commerce, and especially Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, provided various licenses and authorities required for U.S. musicians, technicians, musical and production equipment to travel to Cuba.\n\nA small vocal group of Cuban exiles in Miami protested the concert charging that it would service the PR campaign of the Communistic Castro government. The location of the Havana concert was also seen as possibly symbolic by Cuban exiles, as Revolution Square features the headquarters of the Cuban Communist Party along with a giant metal sculpture of Che Guevara's face. Various demonstrations were staged in South Florida, where some destroyed CDs from Juanes publicly by running them over with a steam roller. Juanes also received death threats from Miami-based critics of the Cuban regime.\n\nBefore and after the performance, Juanes stated that his \"Peace Without Borders\" concert is not about politics but reconciliation. According to William Booth from the Washington Post, whose following commentary is now part of the Congressional Record, \"Tanon shouted that she brought greetings from Miami — home of many Cuban exiles who live in opposition to the Cuban government — and no one in the crowd booed, but instead whistled and cheered\".\n\nThe concert was used by Hugo Chávez during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly of September 24, 2009 to criticize the Cuban exiles in Miami for destroying Juanes' CDs in protest.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6002654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6002654", "title": "Polish–Romanian Alliance", "text": "Polish–Romanian Alliance\n\nThe Polish–Romanian Alliance was a series of treaties signed in the interwar period by the Second Polish Republic and the Kingdom of Romania. The first of them was signed in 1921 and, together, the treaties formed a basis for good foreign relations between the two countries that lasted until World War II began in 1939.\n\nImmediately after World War I, the peace treaties recognized the reestablishment of a Polish state for the first time in over 100 years. Romania emerged from the war as a victorious nation, enlarging its territory (as \"Greater Romania\"). Both states had serious reasons to stand by these treaties.\n\nHaving established contacts with Poland in January–February 1919 (after Stanisław Głąbiński's visit to Bucharest), Romania oriented itself towards a \"cordon sanitaire\" alliance aimed at Bolshevist Russia and the newly created Comintern; the proclamation of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, the German insurrection, and the Red Army's capture of Odessa alarmed politicians in both countries. The diplomat Czesław Pruszyński reported to the Polish government: \n\"A dam that can put a stop to Bolshevik pressure on the West is constituted of Poland to the north, and Romania to the south. [...] There is a natural necessity, but also a historical necessity, that, based on the mutual interests of Romania and Poland, a military alliance be sealed in front of the common threat facing them.\"\n\nRomania was not engaged in the Polish-Soviet War, but accepted and supported Polish military transit through its territory. According to another of Pruszyński's reports, Romania facilitated the transit of Polish nationals from Russia to their native areas, as well as furnishing armament and grain at preferential prices. In this context, the Romanian Army intervened in the Polish-Ukrainian War against the West Ukrainian People's Republic (created in Galicia in the summer of that year), helping the Poles in Pokuttya (\"see Romanian occupation of Pokuttya\").\n\nCount Aleksander Skrzyński, acting with the acknowledgement of Polish leaders Ignacy Jan Paderewski and Józef Piłsudski, extended an offer to the Romanian government of Ion I. C. Brătianu to participate in the future administration of Ukraine in its entirety (August 1919); the message was again stated after Skrzyński became ambassador in Romania the following month. Alexandru G. Florescu, the ambassador to Warsaw, reported back that the plan for a common military administration was: \n\"[...] an inaccuracy and a fantasy which I suppose one should not take into account for anything other than making stock of them.\"\n\nAgreeing with Florescu's assessment, the Brătianu cabinet expressed a will to establish contacts with the Ukrainian People's Republic. In 1920, a similar plan was proposed by Piłsudski himself to the Alexandru Averescu government; the offer was more specific, indicating that Romania was to extend its administration to the east (the Black Sea shore, Odessa, and Transnistria). Averescu refused to accept the proposal, as it meant his country's involvement in the Russian Civil War.\n\nThe first treaty was the Convention on Defensive Alliance, signed on March 3, 1921 in Bucharest. The treaty, concluded for a period of five years, committed both parties to rendering armed assistance to one another \"in case one of the sides is attacked at its present Eastern frontiers\". and was aimed at containing Russia (from 1922, the Soviet Union), which had just lost the Polish-Soviet War. Among the diplomats engaged in negotiations were Polish general Tadeusz Rozwadowski and Romanian general Ion Antonescu. Ratifications for that treaty were exchanged in Bucharest on July 25, 1921. The treaty was registered in \"League of Nations Treaty Series\" on October 24 of the same year.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Romania, along with Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, initiated the Little Entente. The alliance's primary goal was to counter Hungary's revanchism, which involved Romania's Transylvania. Romania's Foreign Minister, Take Ionescu, was unable to bring Poland and Greece into the alliance because of border disagreements between Poland and Czechoslovakia. The Romanian representative in Warsaw reported: \"Poland's policy towards the Little Entente [...] becomes clearer. Poland will not wish to join it. [...] This attitude may be related to Mr. Beneš's, who seems to have declared that Poland's joining the treaty is not currently possible.\"\n\nHowever, in 1925, the Locarno Treaties were signed in which Germany committed to preserve the \"status quo\" in the Rhineland. Germany also signed arbitration conventions with Poland and Czechoslovakia, but the Polish government felt betrayed by France.\nUnder the circumstances, the Polish-Romanian treaty's renewal was discussed in the early months of 1926. The Romanian foreign minister, Ion G. Duca, wrote in a telegram to the Romanian ambassador in France:\n\"Our treaty with Poland expires on the 3rd of March. The Poles will not renew it in the present form, as they have to take into account the atmosphere created by the League of Nations and the Locarno Treaties. They also do not want to keep an exclusively anti-Russian treaty [...] Poland wishes to obtain our help in case it were attacked by Germany.\"\n\nOn March 26, 1926, Poland and Romania signed a \"Treaty of Alliance\" to bolster security in Eastern Europe. It was directed against any attack, not just one coming from the Soviet Union. Ratifications were exchanged in Warsaw on February 9, 1927. The treaty was registered in the \"League of Nations Treaty Series\" on March 7, 1927.\n\nThe Convention was replaced by the Treaty on Mutual Assistance against Aggression and on Military Aid, signed on February 9, 1927 in Warsaw.\n\nIn both countries, political changes were taking place. The King of Romania, Ferdinand I died in 1927, leaving the throne to his young grandson, MihaiI. A regency took over the administration of the monarchic institution until the 1930 takeover of Carol II.\n\nIn Poland, the Sanacja movement took the power after the May Coup, marking the beginning of the Piłsudski's leadership. On January 15, 1931, Poland and Romania signed a Guarantee Treaty. Around October, rumours in Poland that Piłsudski was considering Prince Nicholas, Romania's former regent, for the vacant Polish throne were encouraged by conservative politicians, such as Janusz Radziwiłł. During the Polish leader's visit to Romania in that month, Radziwiłł spoke in the Senate about the possibility of a monarchic revival. That was interpreted by Zdzisław Lubomirski to be the result of \"an indication coming from [Piłsudski]\".\n\nBy 1932, Adolf Hitler was the leader of the most popular political party in Germany. Therefore, Poland tried to secure its eastern border by negotiating a treaty with the Soviets and by signing a Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. Romania could not do the same, however, as the Soviets had not recognized the Soviet-Romanian border on the Dniester and Romania's rule over Bessarabia. In the same year, the Romanian prime minister, Nicolae Iorga, was informed by the ambassador in Warsaw, Grigore Bilciurescu, that conservative groups were considering the possibility of a personal union, with Carol as king of both countries.\n\nRelations became colder as their interests diverged. Romania created the Balkan Pact in 1934, together with Yugoslavia, Turkey and Greece.\n\nUnder the premiership of Gheorghe Tătărescu (1934–1937), Romania's attempt to balance its alliances with Poland and Czechoslovakia was put to the test by a political scandal. Jan Šeba, the Czechoslovak ambassador to Bucharest, published a volume that supported a rapprochement between the Soviet Union and the Little Entente and was prefaced by the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister Kamil Krofta. In early 1937, Krofta denied knowledge of the book's content and, after Tătărescu visited Milan Hodža, his counterpart in Prague, Šeba was recalled. Later that year, Tătărescu met with Polish Foreign Minister Józef Beck in Bucharest. Beck, who had previously opposed the status quo policies of Nicolae Titulescu, unsuccessfully proposed a Romanian withdrawal of its support for Czechoslovakia and an attempt to reach a compromise with Hungary.\n\nIn 1938, in the wake of the Czechoslovak crisis, Beck urged the Romanian government of Miron Cristea, formed by the National Renaissance Front, to participate at the partition of Czechoslovakia (the Munich Agreement), by supporting Hungary's annexation of Carpathian Ruthenia. He hoped that Hungary's Miklós Horthy would no longer sustain claims over Transylvania. However, the offer was refused by Carol Carol II.\n\nAs the situation was becoming increasingly volatile in the eve of World War II, the two countries began improving their relations. In 1938, Richard Franasovici, the Romanian ambassador in Warsaw, reported:\n\"[There is] an obvious improvement of Poland's sentiments towards Romania [...]. The main idea here is maintaining, above everything, the alliance with Romania, of course, due to the growing pressure from Germany, as well as due to the desire to not be completely isolated in the Ukrainian problem [...] Also, [the Poles] consider that the German influence in Budapest and Prague is too powerful [...].\"\n\nBoth countries soon offered each other assistance. After the partition of Czechoslovakia, Romania feared being next. Ambassador Franasovici reported in March 1939 that:\n\"[...] as with their appeasing intervention in Budapest, the Polish government pointed out that any action of Hungary against Romania could lead to a new world war, and guaranteed Romania's peaceful intentions.\"\n\nThe annulment of Polish-Romanian treaties was one of the Soviet demands during prewar French, British, Polish and Soviet negotiations.\n\nPolish diplomacy also secured British guarantees to Romania in the Polish-British Common Defense Pact of 1939. Diplomats and strategists in Poland viewed the alliance with Romania as an important part of Polish foreign and defense policy, but it eventually proved to be mostly irrelevant. Immediately preceding the war, Poland and Romania avoided specifically aiming their agreements against Germany, a country with which both were still seeking a compromise, as Beck and Grigore Gafencu agreed in the April 1939 negotiations in Kraków.\n\nAfter the German invasion of Poland on September 1, Poland declined Romanian military assistance but expected to receive assistance from its British and French allies through Romanian ports; thus the reason for the Romanian Bridgehead plan.\n\nAfter the Red Army joined the German attack on September 17, 1939, with Western assistance not forthcoming, the Polish high command abandoned the plan and ordered its units to evacuate to France. Many units went through Romanian borders, where they were interned, but Romania remained friendly towards Poles, allowing many soldiers to escape from the camps and to move to France. Romania also treated interned Polish soldiers and immigrants but with relative respect throughout the war even after it joined the Axis in 1941. However, as a result of German pressure, Romania could not openly aid the Poles.\n\nOn September 21, 1939, the pro-British prime minister of Romania, Armand Călinescu, was killed in Bucharest by a squad of local fascist activists of the Iron Guard, with German support. Immediately afterwards, German authorities issued propaganda blaming the action on Polish and British initiative. Notably, the Nazi journalist Hans Fritzsche attributed the assassination to Polish and British resentments over Romania's failure to intervene in the war.\n\nThough some politicians, such as Poland's Józef Piłsudski, who had proposed the Międzymorze federation at the end of World War I had attempted to forge a grand coalition of Central, Eastern and Balkan European states, a series of conflicts there had prevented the establishment of anything but a series of smaller, mostly bilateral, treaties.\n\nPoland, for example, had good relations with Latvia, Romania, Hungary and France (with the Franco-Polish Military Alliance) but poor relations with Czechoslovakia and Lithuania (after the Polish-Lithuanian War). Hungary had similar tensions with both Romania and Czechoslovakia. Such conflicts had prevented Poland and Hungary from joining the Little Entente. Over the next two decades, the region's political arena had been largely dominated by treaties and alliances similar to the Polish–Romanian Alliance.\n\n"}
{"id": "375974", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=375974", "title": "Roman Republic (19th century)", "text": "Roman Republic (19th century)\n\nThe Roman Republic was a short-lived state declared on 9 February 1849, when the government of Papal States was temporarily replaced by a republican government due to Pope Pius IX's flight to Gaeta. The republic was led by Carlo Armellini, Giuseppe Mazzini, and Aurelio Saffi. Together they formed a triumvirate, a reflection of a form of government seen in the ancient Roman Republic.\n\nOne of the major innovations the Republic hoped to achieve was enshrined in its constitution: all religions could be practiced freely and the pope was guaranteed the right to govern the Catholic Church. These religious freedoms were quite different from the situation under the preceding government, which allowed only Catholicism and Judaism to be practiced by citizens. The Constitution of the Roman Republic was the first in the world to abolish capital punishment in its constitutional law.\n\nOn 15 November 1848, Pellegrino Rossi, the Minister of Justice of the Papal government, was assassinated. The following day, the liberals of Rome filled the streets, where various groups demanded a democratic government, social reforms and a declaration of war against the Empire of Austria. On the night of 24 November, Pope Pius IX left Rome disguised as an ordinary priest, and went out of the state to Gaeta, a fortress in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Before leaving he had allowed the formation of a government led by Archbishop Carlo Emanuele Muzzarelli, to whom he wrote a note before leaving:\nThe government issued some liberal reforms which Pius IX rejected and when securely established in Gaeta he designed a new government. A delegation was created by the High Council established by the Pope and the mayor of Rome, and sent to reassure the Pope and ask him to come back as soon as possible. This delegation was composed of the mayor himself, Prince Tommaso Corsini, three priests – Rezzi, Mertel and Arrighi – Marchese Paolucci de Calboli, doctor Fusconi and lawyer Rossi. However, they were stopped at the state boundary at Terracina. The Pope, informed of this, refused to speak to them. In Rome a \"Costituente Romana\" was formed, 29 November. \n\nWithout a local government in Rome, for the first time in history, popular assemblies gathered. Margaret Fuller described the procession under a new flag, a \"tricolore\" sent from Venice, that set the flag in the hands of the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius at the Campidoglio, and the angry popular reaction to papal warnings of excommunication for political actions of November received from Gaeta and posted on the 3rd. The \"Costituenti\" decided to schedule direct and universal elections (electors were all the citizens of the State, male and over 21 years old) on the following 21 January 1849. Since the pope had forbidden Catholics to vote at those elections (he considered the convocation of the election \"a monstrous act of felony made without a mask by the sponsors of the anarchic demagogy\", an \"abnormal and sacrilegious attempt... deserving the punishments written both in the divine and the human laws\"), the resulting constitutional assembly (informally known as \"The Assembly of the Damned\") had a republican inclination. In each and every part of the Papal States more than 50% of the potential voters went to the polls.\n\nThe voters were not asked to express themselves on the parties but to vote for individuals. The lawyer Francesco Sturbinetti, who had led the Council of the Deputies, received the most votes, followed by Carlo Armellini, the physician Pietro Sterbini, monsignor Muzzarelli, in whose hands Pius had left the city and Carlo Luciano Bonaparte, prince of Canino. The aristocracy was represented with a prince, six marquises, fifteen counts and three other nobles. The new assembly was dominated by the bourgeoisie, the affluent, professionals and employees. It included twenty-seven owners, a banker, fifty-three jurists and lawyers, six graduates, twelve professors, two writers, twenty-one doctors, one pharmacist, six engineers, five employees, two merchants, nineteen military officers, one prior and one monsignore.\n\nOn February 2, 1849, at a political rally held in the Teatro Apollo, a young Roman ex-priest, the Abbé Arduini, made a speech in which he declared that the temporal power of the popes was a \"historical lie, a political imposture, and a religious immorality.\"\n\nThe Constitutional Assembly convened on 8 February and proclaimed the \"Roman Republic\" after midnight on 9 February. According to Jasper Ridley: \"When the name of Carlo Luciano Bonaparte, who was a member for Viterbo, was called, he replied to the roll-call by calling out \"Long live the Republic!\"\" (\"Viva la Repubblica!\"). That a Roman Republic was a foretaste of wider expectations was expressed in the acclamation of Giuseppe Mazzini as a Roman citizen.\n\nWhen news reached the city of the decisive defeat of Piedmontese forces at the Battle of Novara (22 March), the Assembly proclaimed the \"Triumvirate\", of Carlo Armellini (Roman), Giuseppe Mazzini (Roman) and Aurelio Saffi (from Teramo, Papal States), and a government, led by Muzzarelli and composed also by Aurelio Saffi (from Forlì, Papal States). Among the first acts of the Republic was the proclamation of the right of the Pope to continue his role as head of the Roman Church. The Triumvirate passed popular legislation to eliminate burdensome taxes and to give work to the unemployed.\n\nGiuseppe Garibaldi formed the \"Italian Legion\", with many recruits coming from Piedmont and the Austrian territories of Lombardy and Venetia, and took up a station at the border town of Rieti on the border with the Kingdom of Two Sicilies. There the legion rose to about 1000 and gained discipline and organization.\n\nThe Pope asked for military help from Catholic countries. Saliceti and Montecchi left the Triumvirate; their places were filled on 29 March by Saffi and Giuseppe Mazzini, the Genoese founder of the journal \"La Giovine Italia\", who had been the guiding spirit of the Republic from the start. Mazzini won friends among the poor by confiscating some of the Church's large landholdings and distributing them to peasants. He inaugurated prison and insane asylum reforms, freedom of the press, and secular education, but shied away from the \"Right to Work,\" having seen this measure fail in France.\nHowever, the government's policies (lower taxes, increased spending) meant the government had trouble with its finances and had to resort to inflating the currency in order to pay its debts. Runaway inflation might have doomed the Republic entirely on its own, but it also faced military threats.\n\nPiedmont was at risk of attack by Austrian forces, and the Republic's movement of troops in the area was a threat to Austria (which was certainly capable of attacking Rome itself). The commander-in-chief of Austrian forces in Milan, count Joseph Radetzky, had remarked during the \"Five Glorious Days\" of Milan, \"Three days of blood will give us thirty years of peace\".\n\nBut the Roman Republic would fall to another, unexpected enemy. In France, newly elected President Louis Napoleon, who would soon declare himself emperor Napoleon III, was torn. He himself had participated in an insurrection in the Papal States against the Pope in 1831, but at this point he was under intense pressure from ultramontane French Catholics, who had voted overwhelmingly for him. Though he hesitated to betray Italian liberals, he decided to send troops to restore the Pope.\n\nOn 25 April, some eight to ten thousand French troops under General Charles Oudinot landed at Civitavecchia on the coast northwest of Rome, while Spain sent 4 000 men under Fernando Fernández de Córdova to Gaeta, where the Pope remained in his refuge. The French sent a staff officer the next day to meet with Giuseppe Mazzini with a stiff assertion that the pope would be restored to power. The revolutionary Roman Assembly, amid thunderous shouts of \"Guerra!, Guerra!\", authorised Mazzini to resist the French by force of arms.\n\nThe French expected little resistance from the \"usurpers\". But republican resolve was stiffened by the charismatic Giuseppe Garibaldi's long-delayed triumphal entry into Rome at last, on 27 April, and by the arrival on 29 April of the Lombard Bersaglieri, who had recently driven the Austrians from the streets of Milan with new tactics of house-to-house fighting. Hasty defenses were erected on the Janiculum wall, and the villas on the city's outskirts were garrisoned. On 30 April, Oudinot's out-of-date maps led him to march to a gate that had been walled up some time before. The first cannon-shot was mistaken for the noon-day gun, and the astonished French were beaten back by the fiercely anti-clerical Romans of Trastevere, Garibaldi's legionaries and citizen-soldiers, who sent them back to the sea. But despite Garibaldi's urging, Mazzini was loath to follow up their advantage, as he had not expected an attack by the French and hoped that the Roman Republic could befriend the French Republic. The French prisoners were treated as \"ospiti della guerra\" and sent back with republican tracts citing the Article V of the most recent French constitution: \"France respects foreign nationalities. Her might will never be employed against the liberty of any people\".\n\nAs a result, Oudinot was able to regroup and await reinforcements; time proved to be on his side, and Mazzini's attempt at diplomacy proved fatal to the Roman Republic. A letter from Louis Napoleon encouraged Oudinot and assured him of French reinforcements. The French government sent Ferdinand de Lesseps to negotiate a more formal ceasefire. Neapolitan troops sympathetic to the Papacy entered Roman Republic territory, and de Lesseps suggested that Oudinot's forces in their current position might protect the city from the converging approach of an Austrian army with the Neapolitan force: the Roman Triumvirate agreed. Many Italians from outside the Papal States went to Rome to fight for the Republic: among them was Goffredo Mameli, who had tried to form a common state joining Roman Republic and Tuscany, and who died of a wound suffered in the defense of Rome.\n\nThe siege began in earnest on 1 June, and despite the resistance of the Republican army, led by Garibaldi, the French prevailed on 29 June. On 30 June the Roman Assembly met and debated three options: to surrender; to continue fighting in the streets of Rome; to retreat from Rome and continue the resistance from the Apennine mountains. Garibaldi made a speech in which he favoured the third option and then said: \"Dovunque saremo, colà sarà Roma.\" (\"Wherever we may be, there will be Rome\").\n\nA truce was negotiated on 1 July and on 2 July Garibaldi, followed by some 4 000 troops, withdrew from Rome for refuge in the neutral republic of San Marino. The French Army entered Rome on 3 July and reestablished the Holy See's temporal power. In August Louis Napoleon issued a sort of manifesto in which he asked of Pius IX a general amnesty, a secularized administration, the establishment of the Code Napoléon, and in general a Liberal Government. Pius, from Gaeta, promised reforms that he declared \"motu proprio\", that is, of his own volition, not in answer to the French.\n\nThe Pope did not return to Rome itself until April 1850, since the French were considered liberals all the same, and the Pope would not return until assured of no French meddling in his affairs. French soldiers propped up the Papal administration in Rome until they were withdrawn at the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, leading to the subsequent capture of Rome and annexation by the Kingdom of Italy.\n\nAccording to Raffaele De Cesare:\nThe Roman question was the stone tied to Napoleon's feet — that dragged him into the abyss. He never forgot, even in August 1870, a month before Sedan, that he was a sovereign of a Catholic country, that he had been made emperor, and was supported by the votes of the conservatives and the influence of the clergy; and that it was his supreme duty not to abandon the pontiff. […] For twenty years Napoleon III had been the true sovereign of Rome, where he had many friends and relations […] Without him the temporal power would never have been reconstituted, nor, being reconstituted, would have endured.\"\n\nIn 1949 an Italian film, \"Cavalcade of Heroes\", was made to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the Republic, although it was not released until the following year. It was directed by Mario Costa and starred Carla Del Poggio and Cesare Danova.\n\nArthur Hugh Clough's long poem \"Amours de Voyage\" takes place during the siege of Rome, with one character describing the fighting in letters to his friend.\n\nThe movie \"In the Name of the Sovereign People\", 1990, directed by Luigi Magni, winner of the David di Donatello, is dedicated to the Roman Republic and his protagonists.\n\nThe 2012 TV fiction \"Anita Garibaldi\", directed by Claudio Bonivento.\n\n\"Follow My Black Plume\" is a juvenile historical novel by Geoffrey Trease set during the Republic, based on Trevalyn's account.\n\n\n"}

It was named for his wife Beatriz Clara Coya, a member of the royal Incan house. The Mapuche called the city Millacoya, meaning gold princess from the mapudungun \"milla\", gold and the quechua \"coya\", princess. \n\nThe city was near the confluence of the Bio-Bio and Laja Rivers on the right bank of the upper reach of the Rele River in Catiray, ten kilometers south of the Bio Bio. The site was in an elevated location but with a shortage of water. Gold mines were located across the Rele on a stream called Millapoa. It had a population that supported three churches but it did not flourish. It was abandoned soon after the Disaster of Curalaba and was destroyed by Pelantaro in February 1599. Governor Alonso de Ribera attempted to rebuild it in a better site in 1601 closer to the Bio Bio and the forts of San Rosendo, Chivicura and Jesus de Huenuraquí.

{"id": "6110739", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6110739", "title": "Shark finning", "text": "Shark finning\n\nShark finning is the act of removing fins from sharks and discarding the rest of the shark. The sharks are often still alive when discarded, but without their fins. Unable to swim effectively, they sink to the bottom of the ocean and die of suffocation or are eaten by other predators. Shark finning at sea enables fishing vessels to increase profitability and increase the number of sharks harvested, as they only have to store and transport the fins, by far the most profitable part of the shark; the shark meat is bulky to transport. Some countries have banned this practice and require the whole shark to be brought back to port before removing the fins.\n\nShark finning increased since 1997 largely due to the increasing demand for shark fins for shark fin soup and traditional cures, particularly in China and its territories, and as a result of improved fishing technology and market economics. The International Union for Conservation of Nature's Shark Specialist Group say that shark finning is widespread, and that \"the rapidly expanding and largely unregulated shark fin trade represents one of the most serious threats to shark populations worldwide\". Estimates of the global value of the shark fin trade range from US$540 million to US$1.2 billion (2007). Shark fins are among the most expensive seafood products, commonly retailing at US$400 per kg. In the United States, where finning is prohibited, some buyers regard the whale shark and the basking shark as trophy species, and pay $10,000 to $20,000 for a fin.\n\nThe regulated global catch of sharks reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has been stable in recent years at an annual average just over 500,000 tonnes. Additional unregulated and unreported catches are thought to be common.\n\nNearly every fin of a shark is targeted for harvest, as highlighted in the diagram. The primary and secondary dorsal fins are removed from the top of the shark, plus its pectoral fins, and, in a single cutting motion, the pelvic fin, anal fin, and bottom portion of its caudal fin, or tail.\n\nBecause the rest of the shark has little value relative to that of its fins, sharks are sometimes finned while fishing vessels are still at sea, and the finless and often still-living shark is thrown back into the sea to free space aboard the vessel. In legal contexts the use of the term \"shark finning\" can refer specifically to this practice of removing the fins from live sharks and discarding the carcass while still at sea. For these legal purposes the removal of fins on land during catch processing is not necessarily considered to be shark finning.\n\nShark species that are commonly finned are:\n\n\nWhen sharks have been finned, they are likely to die from lack of oxygen because they are not able to move to filter the water through their gills, or are eaten by other fish that have found them defenseless at the bottom of the ocean. Though studies suggest that 73 million sharks are finned each year, scientists have noted that the numbers may actually be closer to the 100 million mark. Due to the fact that sharks do not mature and mate until they are approximately 30 years old, their reproduction rate is slow and cannot keep pace with the current mortality rate.\n\nSome studies suggest 26 to 73 million sharks are harvested annually for fins. The annual median for the period from 1996 to 2000 was 38 million, which is nearly four times the number recorded by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, but considerably lower than the estimates of many conservationists.\nIt has been reported that the global shark catch in 2012 was 100 million.\n\nSharks have a K-selection life history, which means that they tend to grow slowly, reach maturity at a larger size and a later age, and have low reproductive rates. These traits make them especially vulnerable to overfishing methods, such as shark finning. Recent studies suggest changes in abundance of apex predators may have cascading impacts on a variety of ecological processes.\n\nNumbers of some shark species have dropped as much as 80% over the last 50 years.\nSome organizations claim that shark fishing or bycatch (the unintentional capture of species by other fisheries) is the reason for the decline in some species' populations and that the market for fins has very little impact – bycatch accounts for an estimated 50% of all sharks taken – others that the market for shark fin soup is the main reason for the decline.\n\nSharks are apex predators and have extensive implications for marine systems an processes, particularly coral reefs. A report by WildAid on global threats to sharks further explains the importance of these animals.\n\nFins from the critically endangered sawfish (Pristidae) \"are highly favored in Asian markets and are some of the most valuable shark fins\". Sawfishes are now protected under the highest protection level of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), Appendix I.\n\nOn the IUCN Red List there are 39 species of elasmobranches (sharks and rays) listed as threatened species (Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable).\n\nIn 2013, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) listed the vulnerability of sharks.\n\nAppendix I, which lists animals that are threatened with extinction, lists\n\nAppendix II, which lists animals that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled, lists\nA further five species are listed as of 2014 –\n\nThe crew of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society conservation vessel RV \"Ocean warrior\" witnessed and photographed industrial-scale finning within Costa Rica's Cocos Island National Park protected marine area. The practice is featured in the documentary \"Sharks: Stewards of the Reef\", which contains footage from Western Australia and Central America and also examines shark finning's cultural, financial and ecological impacts. Underwater photographer Richard Merritt witnessed finning of living sharks in Indonesia where he saw immobile finless sharks lying on the sea bed still alive below the fishing boat. Finning has been witnessed and filmed within a protected marine area in the Raja Ampat islands of Indonesia.\n\nAnimal welfare groups vigorously oppose finning on perceived moral grounds and also because it is one cause for the rapid decline of global shark populations.\n\nBecause of the lucrative profits and alleged size of the market, there are allegations of links to organized crime. Opponents also raise questions on the medical harm from the consumption of high levels of toxic mercury reportedly found in shark fins.\nA third of fins imported to Hong Kong come from Europe. Spain is by far the largest supplier, providing between 2,000 and 5,000 metric tons a year. Norway supplies 39 metric tonnes, but Britain, France, Portugal and Italy are also major suppliers. Hong Kong handles at least 50% and possibly up to 80% of the world trade in shark fin, with the major suppliers being Europe, Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, United States, Yemen, India, Japan, and Mexico.\nAccording to Giam's article, \"Sharks are caught in virtually all parts of the world... Despite the strongly declared objectives of the Fisheries Commission in Brussels, there are very few restrictions on fishing for sharks in European waters. The meat of dogfishes, smoothhounds, cat sharks, skates and rays is in high demand by European consumers... The situation in Canada and the United States is similar: the blue shark is sought after as a sport fish while the porbeagle, mako and spiny dogfish are part of the commercial fishery... The truth is this: Sharks will continue to be caught and killed on a wide scale by the more organized and sophisticated fishing nations. Targeting shark's fin soup will not stop this accidental catch. The fins from these catches will be thrown away or turned into animal feed and fertilizers if shark's fin soup is shunned.\"\n\nIn 2007, Canadian filmmaker and photographer Rob Stewart created a film, \"Sharkwater\", which exposes the shark fin industry in detail.\nIn March 2011, the VOA Special English service of the Voice of America broadcast a 15-minute science program on shark finning.\n\nAccording to Giam Choo Hoo – the longest serving member of The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora Animals Committee, and a representative of the shark fin industry in Singapore – \"The perception that it is common practice to kill sharks for only their fins – and to cut them off whilst the sharks are still alive – is wrong... The vast majority of fins in the market are taken from sharks after their death.\"\n\nHowever, researchers dispute this claim by pointing to the data: using a statistical analysis of shark fin industry trade data, a 2006 study estimated that between 26 and 73 million sharks are harvested each year worldwide. That figure, when converted to shark biomass, was three to four times higher than the catch recorded in Food and Agriculture Organization capture production statistics, the only global database of shark catches. According to the researchers, this discrepancy \"may be attributable to factors... such as unrecorded shark landings, shark biomass recorded in [non-specific] categories, and/or a high frequency of shark finning and carcass disposal at sea.\" Simply put, they say that the industry is either under-reporting the sharks taken annually, or is frequently engaging in the practice of finning.\n\nIn 2013, 27 countries and the European Union had banned shark finning; however, international waters are unregulated. International fishing authorities are considering banning shark fishing (and finning) in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Finning is banned in the Eastern Pacific, but shark fishing and finning continues unabated in most of the Pacific and Indian Ocean. In countries such as Thailand and Singapore, public awareness advertisements on finning have reportedly reduced consumption by 25%.\n\nThere are four main categories of restrictions, as follows: \n\nShark finning was prohibited in the EU in 2003 (Regulation (EC) No 1185/2003).\n\nIn November 2011, the EC approved a rule that would require all EU-registered fishing boats to land only sharks which have retained all their fins. Because the legislation allowed fins to be removed on the boat and different body parts to be landed at different ports, the ban proved difficult to enforce. The EU Parliament's fisheries committee supported the EC's proposal to ban the separate landing of shark bodies and fins, however, the committee approved an amendment which allows fins to be removed on board a vessel.\n\nOn 19 March 2012, the Council of the EU adopted a general approach supporting the Commission's proposal to close the loopholes in the EU shark finning legislation by ensuring that all sharks were landed with their fins naturally attached without exception. It is believed that Spain and Portugal were the only EU Member States to raise objections to the Commission's proposal.\n\nOn 6 June 2013, the Council of the EU completed the final step to close loopholes in the EU shark finning ban. By adopting a \"fins naturally attached\" policy without exception, the EU has now effectively ended the practice of shark finning by EU vessels.\n\nShark finning is not allowed in any tuna or billfish longline fishery, or in any Commonwealth fishery taking sharks. Fins must be landed attached, and additional regulations apply in some states or territories. In New South Wales, sharks taken or any relevant portion of a shark taken may not be on board any vessel at any time (including after landing) without fins naturally attached.\n\nIn Australia, the export and import of wildlife and wildlife products is regulated under Part 13A of the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), which is administered by the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. Regulation applies equally to individuals, commercial organisations and not-for-profit organisations. CITES Appendix II shark specimens cannot be legally imported into Australia for personal or commercial purposes unless:\n\nNo permits are required for the import of specimens obtained from shark species other than those listed above, however, to avoid seizure all products must be clearly labelled or have documentation certifying the species of origin.\n\nShark finning has been illegal in Canada since 1994, but importing fins from other regions without such regulations is allowed.\n\nIn late 2011, the city of Brantford, Ontario became the first city in Canada to pass new bylaws to ban the possession, sale or consumption of shark fin products. In that medium-sized city in which no restaurants exist which serve shark fin, there was no opposition to the ban, which was largely symbolic. Nevertheless, a handful of cities soon followed, notably Toronto, Calgary, Mississauga and several others in Southern Ontario:\n\n\nMarkham and Richmond Hill opted not to bring forth the motion, suggesting that this issue is a federal matter. Chinese restaurants and businesses selling shark's fin opposed the ban, and in late 2011, suggested that they will challenge the by-laws before the courts once fines are imposed. When Toronto imposed steep fines, they did just that.\n\nIn late 2012, the Ontario Superior Court overturned Toronto's shark fin ban, ruling that the law as written was outside the powers of the city to impose without a \"legitimate local purpose\", and was therefore of \"no force and effect.\" The judge accepted that the practice of shark finning was inhumane, but he did not agree with Toronto's justification of local purpose —– namely, that the consumption of shark fins may have an \"adverse impact\" on the health and safety of its residents and on the environmental well-being of the city. Toronto has served legal notice that it plans to appeal the court ruling.\n\nOn 1 December 2012, Ontario Superior Court Judge James Spence ruled that Toronto's ban was not valid. Members of Toronto's Chinese business community had also challenged that ban. Judge Spence had said the city does not have the power to enforce the ban. Toronto's mayor Rob Ford in September 2012 believed the ban was not the cities responsibility and so did not support it at that time.\n\nOn 27 March 2013 a private members bill to ban shark fin imports into Canada failed in the House of Commons. Shark finning was already illegal in Canadian waters, but there was no law to stop importing into Canada. However, it would be restarted by Conservative Senate member Michael L. MacDonald in Bill S-238 which was passed by the Senate on October 23, 2018. That bill will now go to the House of Commons for further debate.\n\nOn 8 May 2013 Calgary's City Council decided to wait until December 2013 and recommended leaning away from a total ban and look for ethical sources of shark products. Alderman John Mar said there will be more time to discuss and engage and to look for other options. The new wording in the bylaw was meant to ban the sale, distribution and trade of shark fins, but not ban the possession and consumption. Canada's city of Vancouver councillor Kerry Jang was at Calgary's council meeting and said that it was not a cultural thing, and that even China and the Chinese government decided to phase out all shark fins from state banquets. He also mentioned that the wordings of the bylaws in Calgary and Toronto, which face legal problems with municipal jurisdiction, are trying to ban possession and consumption, but that is hard to enforce and regulate.\n\nOn 27 May 2013, against the wishes of the Shark Fin Free Calgary organization, Calgary City Council overturned the ban. There were protests against the ban from Calgary's Chinese community, and Calgary's city task force recommended against the ban. According to the article in The Calgary Herald, Calgary's Mayor Naheed Nenshi never wanted a full ban, even though he had voted for the ban the previous year.\n\nNBA All-Star Chinese basketball player Yao Ming pledged to stop eating shark fin soup at a news conference on 2 August 2006. American basketball player Tracy McGrady, a teammate of Yao's, reportedly stated that he was impressed by the soup when he tried it for the first time, but was criticized by the Hong Kong branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature for his remark. The Australian naturalist Steve Irwin was known to walk out of Chinese restaurants if he saw shark fin soup on the menu. American chef Ken Hom sees the West doing little to protect stocks of cod and caviar-producing sturgeon despite the outcry over shark-finning, but he also stresses the wastefulness of harvesting only the fins.\n\nThe World Wide Fund for Nature on 8 March 2018 reported, \"The volume of shark fin imported into Hong Kong has declined from 10,210 tonnes in 2007 to 4,979 tonnes in 2017, a drop of over 50 per cent.\" Protestors have targeted various brands with anti-shark fin demonstrations. After being targeted in a May 2016 protest at Hong Kong International Airport, Cathay Pacific in June 2016 announced they would stop shipping shark fin.\nDisneyland Hong Kong removed shark fin soup from its wedding banquet menu after international pressure from environmental groups, who threatened to boycott its parks worldwide despite the high demand for the delicacy.\nThe Peninsula Hotel banned shark fin in 2012. In April 2018 Shark fin protesters gatecrashed the opening of Shake Shack at the IFC in Hong Kong. This was due to Shake Shack partnering with Maxim's Caterers being Shake Shack's Hong Kong licensee. Brand premises directly owned by Maxim's have been targeted in numerous protests. On 15 June 2018 protestors directly targeted Maxim's headquarters in a demonstration that also highlighted Maxim's being a regional licensee for Starbucks.\n\nTaiwan banned shark finning in 2011.\n\nMalaysia was one of the top 10 importers and exporters of shark fins in the world between 2000 and 2009. The country caught 231,212 tonnes of sharks from 2002 to 2011, making it the eighth highest in the world and accounting for 2.9% of the global sharks caught during the same period.\n\nIn 2007, Malaysia's Natural Resources and Environment Ministry, Azmi Khalid, banned shark's fin soup from official functions committing to the Malaysian Nature Society (for conservation of shark species). In 2012, the Sabah Tourism, Culture and Environment Minister proposed an amendment to the Fisheries Act that would give force to setting up a shark sanctuary zone in Semporna and other shark populated areas in Sabah. This ban was put on hold pending the Federal Government's decision on the issue. In 2015, Agriculture and Agro-based Industry Minister, Ahmad Shabery Cheek, said that the ban of shark finning is \"unnecessary\" as the finning industry does not exist in Malaysia He went on further to say \"Sharks are normally caught by accident when they enter the fish nets along with the other fishes.\"\n\nThe great white sharks have been given full protection in the territorial waters of New Zealand but shark finning is legal on other shark species if the shark is dead. The Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society of New Zealand are campaigning to raise awareness of shark finning and a number of foodies have fronted the campaign.\n\nAt 10 November 2013, an announcement was made by the conservation minister proposing that shark finning will be outlawed in New Zealand waters.\n\nIn 2009, the Republic of Palau created the world's first shark sanctuary. It is illegal to catch sharks within Palau's EEZ, which covers an area of . This is an area about the size of France. President Johnson Toribiong also called for a ban on global shark finning, stating: \"These creatures are being slaughtered and are perhaps at the brink of extinction unless we take positive action to protect them.\"\n\nLeading Singapore-based supermarket chain Cold Storage, has joined the World Wide Fund for Nature Singapore Sustainable seafood Group and agreed to stop selling all shark fin and shark products in its 42 outlets across the country. The supermarket is a subsidiary of Dairy Farm, a leading pan-Asian food retailer that operates more than 5,300 outlets and employs some 80,000 people in the Asia-Pacific region. It is the first supermarket in Singapore to implement a no shark fins policy.\n\nThe largest supermarket chain in Singapore, NTUC Fairprice and hypermarket Carrefour will also be banning all shark fin products from its outlets before April 2012.\n\nBill Clinton signed the Shark Finning Prohibition Act of 2000 (SFPA), which banned finning on any fishing vessel within United States territorial waters, and on all U.S.-flagged fishing vessels in international waters. Additionally, shark fins could not be imported into the United States without the associated carcass. In 1991, the percentage of sharks killed by U.S. longline fisheries in the Pacific Ocean for finning was approximately 3%. By 1998, that percentage had grown to 60%. Between 1991 and 1998, the number of sharks retained by the Hawaii-based swordfish and tuna longline fishery had increased from 2,289 to 60,857 annually, and by 1998, an estimated 98% of these sharks were killed for their fins.\n\nIn 2002, in an apparent early success in stopping the shark fin trade, the United States intercepted and seized the \"King Diamond II\", a U.S.-flagged, Hong Kong-based vessel bound for Guatemala. The vessel was carrying of baled shark fins – representing the fins of an estimated 30,000 sharks – making it the largest quantity of shark fins ever seized. This seizure was reversed in court six years later: in \"United States v. Approximately 64,695 Pounds of Shark Fins\", the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the SFPA did not cover the seized fins in this case. Judge Stephen Reinhardt found that the \"King Diamond II\" did not meet the statute's definition of a fishing vessel, since it had merely bought the fins at sea and had not aided or assisted the vessels that had caught the sharks.\n\nAs a result, in January 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act into law to close the loopholes. Specifically, the new law prohibits any boat to carry shark fins without the corresponding number and weight of carcasses, and all sharks must be brought to port with their fins attached.\n\nIn 2010, Hawaii became the first state to ban the possession, sale and distribution of shark fins. The law became effective on 1 July 2011. Similar laws have been enacted in the states of Washington, Oregon, California, the territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. California governor Jerry Brown cited the cruelty of finning and potential threats to the environment and commercial fishing in signing the bill. Opponents charged the ban was discriminatory against Chinese, the main consumers of shark fin soup, when federal laws already banned the practice of finning. Whole sharks would still be legally fished, but the fins could no longer be sold.\n\nIn 2012, legislators in the New York State Assembly, including Grace Meng, introduced a similar bill, which passed in 2013. While New York was not the only Eastern state considering a ban, passage there would be significant since its Chinese American communities in Chinatown, Manhattan and Flushing make New York the major importer of shark fins in the East. Meng admitted that while she loved shark fin soup, \"it's important to be responsible citizens.\" Younger Chinese Americans in New York did not consider it an important part of their culture. \"It's only the elderly who want it: when their grandkids get married, they want the most expensive stuff, like an emperor,\" said one waiter at a Chinese restaurant. Many businesses that sold fins had stopped placing new orders, expecting a ban would be passed.\n\nIn April 2013, Maryland became the first state on the East Coast to enact a law against shark finning or the import of fins. Texas, Illinois, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts have also enacted bans, totaling 11 states.\n\nAs of September 2018, 12 U.S. states and 3 U.S. territories have banned the sale or possession of shark fins:\nIn recent decades high demands and numerous forces of economic globalization has come together to create a true global mart. There has been a combination of growth and antifinning regulations that has led fishers to see sharks as a commercial species. This has unintentionally caused commercial species to be targeted rather than targeting more-valuable species like tuna and swordfish. \nHowever, the emergence of a new market for shark fins with addition to stricter regulations has all created a greater incentive for the full utilization of the shark. Now this is an important aspect to consider, as where antifinning and environmental groups can be successful in terms of decreasing the consumption and the practice of shark finning.\n\n"}

The Battle of Ascalon was fought outside the city in 1099 in the aftermath of the First Crusade and the fall of Jerusalem to the Crusaders. Although the crusaders were victorious, internal disputes in their camp allowed Ascalon to remain in Egyptian hands. Thereafter, the Fatimids were able to launch raids into the kingdom every year from this fortress, and the southern border of the crusader kingdom remained unstable. If this fortress fell, then the gateway to Egypt would be open. Therefore, the Fatimid garrison in Ascalon remained strong and large.\n\nAfter the failure of the Second Crusade in 1148, Conrad III of Germany attempted to besiege the fortress, but was forced to withdraw when no help was forthcoming from Jerusalem or other crusaders. Meanwhile, the territory to the east and north of Jerusalem was united under Nur ad-Din Zangi, who ruled Mosul and Aleppo and brought Damascus under his influence after the Second Crusade. In 1149 Nur ad-Din defeated the Principality of Antioch at the Battle of Inab. Nur ad-Din was unable to overrun Antioch entirely, nor was he able to penetrate far into the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but likewise there was little Jerusalem could do in the north and the east with the whole area united under one strong ruler. The crusader kingdom would have to look towards Egypt if they wanted to expand.\n\nAround 1150, Baldwin III of Jerusalem rebuilt the Gaza City, which at that point lay in ruins. The city was handed over to the Knights Templar, and provided some defense against the continual raids from Ascalon, to the northeast. Since the establishment of the kingdom, other fortresses had also been built to watch Ascalon. These were Ibelin (Yibneh) about northeast of Ascalon near the coast, Blanchegarde (Tell es Safi) about east-northeast, Beth Gibelin (Bait Jibrin) about east and Montgisard near Ramla to the northeast.\n\nHowever, Jerusalem itself was soon divided by civil war. Baldwin III was the legal heir to the kingdom, but his mother Queen Melisende had been ruling as regent since 1143. In 1152 Baldwin finally demanded full control of the kingdom; after some brief fighting he was able to accomplish this goal. Later that year Baldwin also defeated a Seljuk Turkish invasion of the Kingdom. Encouraged by these victories, Baldwin decided to make an assault on Ascalon in 1153. With the entire army of Jerusalem he marched to the fortress and began to destroy the surrounding orchards in January. Patriarch Fulcher was also present, along with Raymond du Puy de Provence and Bernard de Tremelay, the masters of the Hospitallers and Templars respectively, and all the other great barons of the kingdom, including Hugh of Ibelin, Philip of Milly, Humphrey II of Toron, and Raynald of Châtillon. The siege was undertaken both by land and by sea, with the fleet commanded by Gerard of Sidon. The crusader force was also bolstered by a large group of pilgrims, who happened to be on their way to Jerusalem at the time.\n\nOn the Fatimid side, the city was garrisoned by members of the local Kananiyya tribe, as well as a cavalry contingent from Cairo, some 400 to 600 strong, that was rotated into the city every six months. In response to the Crusader attack, the vizier Ibn as-Sallar began preparing reinforcements for the city in March, as well as a naval expedition. The army set off and got as far as Bilbays, while Ibn al-Sallar supervised the final preparations of the fleet, including a naval review and the payment of the crews. The army commanders at Bilbays, led by Ibn al-Sallar's stepson Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh, hatched a plot to kill the vizier, which was carried out on 3 April. The army returned to Cairo, where Abbas became vizier, leaving Ascalon largely to its fate. The Fatimid fleet sailed to Ascalon and easily dispersed the weak Crusader squadron of 15 ships, but as the city's harbour was unsuitable for sustaining a fleet for long periods of time, it had to return to Egypt.\n\nSiege towers were constructed, and for five months there were many skirmishes and victories and defeats on both sides. Ascalon was vast and virtually impenetrable; behind its massive walls and gates were twice as many defenders as there were besiegers outside, and there were supplies of food to last for years. In May the Egyptian fleet arrived to resupply the city; Gerard of Sidon's little fleet could do nothing to stop them. However, a setback for Ascalon occurred in August when the besieged tried to burn down one of the crusader siege towers; the wind pushed the fire back against their own walls, causing a large section to collapse. According to William of Tyre, knights of the Order rushed through the breach without Baldwin's knowledge while Bernard de Tremelay and about forty of his Templars were killed by the larger Egyptian garrison. Their bodies were displayed on the ramparts and their heads were sent to the caliph in Cairo. In a differing account by a Damascene chronicler in the city, the breach of the wall is simply mentioned as a precursor to the fall of the city; he makes no mention of the incident with the Templars. Because of William of Tyre's dislike of the Order, and the wildly inaccurate news that reached Europe during the crusades, his account must be treated with caution; but regardless of which account is believed, Bernard was killed during the fighting.\n\nBy now the crusaders were becoming fatigued and it was suggested that they abandon the siege. The Hospitallers and the Patriarch, however, convinced the king that they were on the verge of victory. Three days later another assault was made, and another entrance was forced. After bitter fighting the city fell to the crusaders on August 19, and the fortress was formally surrendered to them three days later. The citizens were allowed to leave in peace; most fled back to Egypt.\n\nAscalon was turned into a diocese directly under the Patriarch of Jerusalem, although in earlier times it had been a suffragan of the Bishop of Bethlehem. The city's mosque was reconsecrated as a church. The city was also added to the County of Jaffa, which was already held by Baldwin III's brother Amalric. The double County of Jaffa and Ascalon later became the most important crusader seigneury, held either as an apanage to the crown or granted to influential barons.\n\nThe fall of Ascalon contributed to the downfall of Fatimid Egypt. Amalric succeeded his brother as king of Jerusalem in 1162, and throughout the 1160s led numerous expeditions from Ascalon into Egypt. These Crusader invasions of Egypt failed to bring that country under Amalric's control.\n\n"}

The conspirators were discovered and executed. The story is part of Rome's early semi-legendary history.\n\nIn 509 BC the Roman monarchy was overthrown as a result of general resentment at the behaviour of the king Tarquinius Superbus, and especially his son Sextus Tarquinius who had raped Lucretia, a Roman woman of noble background. A coup, led by Lucius Junius Brutus, resulted in the expulsion of the royal family. The Roman Republic was established, and consuls were elected to govern the city on an annual basis.\n\nBrutus was elected as one of Rome's first two consuls in 509 BC. In that year ambassadors from the royal family arrived in Rome to seek to persuade the senate to return to the royals their personal effects which had been seized during the coup. In secret, while the Roman senate debated the request, the ambassadors sought supporters of the monarchy in Rome to form a conspiracy to re-admit the royal family to the city. Two brothers of Brutus' wife, of the Vitellii, both of whom were senators, were chief amongst the conspiracy, along with three brothers of the Aquilii, and other leading men whose names are no longer recorded. Two of Brutus' sons, Titus Junius Brutus and Tiberius Junius Brutus joined them.\nHowever, a slave of the Vitelii, having witnessed a meeting of the conspirators at his master's house (which, according to Plutarch, involved a horrific oath by human sacrifice and cannibalism), alerted the consuls who immediately seized the ambassadors and the conspirators without great tumult.\n\nThe ambassadors of the royal family had persuaded the conspirators to confirm their dedication to the royalist cause in writing, and therefore the guilt of the conspirators was not in doubt.\n\nThe ambassadors were released, out of respect for the law of nations. However the traitors were condemned to death, including the sons of Brutus.\n\nThe consuls sat upon the tribunal to witness the execution. The lictors were dispatched to carry out the punishment. The traitors were stripped naked, beaten with rods, and then beheaded. Brutus the consul is said to have burst forth with emotion at times during the punishment of his sons, although elsewhere he is said to have watched stoically while the punishment was carried out.\n\nThe slave who had revealed the conspiracy was granted his freedom and status as a Roman citizen, and was also awarded a sum of money as reward.\n"}

It consists of a team of professionals from various backgrounds in science, technology, finance, and media, that came together in 2010 with the aim of winning the Google Lunar X Prize competition announced in 2007. Although the competition ended in 2018 without a winner, TeamIndus is still working towards developing and launching their lunar rover mission sometime in 2019.\n\nTeamIndus' lander is code-named HHK1, and their rover is called ECA, an abbreviation for \"Ek Choti si Asha\" (\"A Small Hope\").\n\nAxiom Research Labs was established in 2010 with the aim to compete for the Google Lunar X Prize, and the following year it registered its team as TeamIndus. One of its co-founders was Rahul Narayan, who said in 2016 that the overall cost of the venture was expected to be US$75 million. In 2013, TeamIndus moved from Delhi to Bangalore due to the strategic location of the city. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is based in Bangalore which has also excellent aerospace companies that could help the team with building the lander and rover. L&T was helping by reviewing designs, and Rajiv Mody, founder CEO of the engineering firm Sasken Technologies gave space in its Bangalore facility for the team to operate out of and several former ISRO scientists were providing advice.\n\nThe single largest investor at that time was Nandan Nilekani, who became involved in 2014 when TeamIndus launched its first round of funding, raising US$35 million. A second fundraising round in 2016 obtained investment from people such as R. K. Damani, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, Ashish Kacholia, Rajiv Mody, Subrata Mitra, Shekhar Kirani, and Sharad Sharma.\n\nThe organisation was awarded in January 2015 an interim US$1 million prize by Google Lunar X Prize for their successful demonstration on Earth of a proposed lunar landing system.\n\nThe Google Lunar X Prize competition ended in 2018 without a winner as no team met the 31 March 2018 launch deadline. Regardless, TeamIndus is still looking for funding in order to continue development and secure a launch vehicle for sometime in 2019.\n\nIn 2011, Axiom Research Labs registered a competing team at the Google Lunar X Prize under the name TeamIndus. The Google Lunar X Prize was a competition announced in 2007 that was open to privately funded ventures aimed at inspiring the development of low-cost robotic lunar exploration. The competing craft were required to travel more than on the lunar surface and transmit high-resolution video and images once there. TeamIndus registered for the competition in 2011. The launch deadline of the competition, which initially attracted entries from over 30 teams from 17 countries, was 31 March 2018.\n\nGoogle Lunar X Prize offered a main prize of US$20 million, a second prize of US$5 million and bonus prizes of US$5 million. Additional prizes totalling US$4.75 million were offered to those teams that met specific targets by 31 March 2018. The competition ended in 2018 without a winner as no team met the launch deadline. TeamIndus initially planned to attempt to win the endurance and distance bonus prizes by designing a lunar lander and two rovers. They planned for the two rovers to be deployed together, which had a combined total mass of approximately . One rover was to compete for the main task, i.e. to travel more than 500 meters on the lunar surface and send feedback to Earth. The other rover would have competed for the US$5 million worth prize by completing additional tasks beyond baseline requirements to win the grand or the second place prize, such as endurance and range.\n\nIn 2016, a contract with ISRO for a launch in 2017 was scheduled, using a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle operated by ISRO from the island of Sriharikota. The launch contract was signed but not fully paid for. The rocket was to be shared with Hakuto, a fellow competitor from Japan. The planned mission duration was 30 Earth days.\n\nThe TeamIndus' lunar lander platform was code-named HHK1. The team planned a further modification of the HHK1 for other terrestrial and inter-stellar application after the Google Lunar X Prize competition had completed. For the competition, the HHK1 was to deploy the rovers and then operate as the main communication and control unit consisting of payload, propulsion, structural and other sub-systems. The HHK-1 lander was designed to carry a payload of about 25 kg, including their two small rovers.\n\nShort in time and money, TeamIndus was unable to launch before the deadline, and although the competition ended in 2018 without a winner, TeamIndus is still working towards obtaining funding to develop and secure a launch contract for a desired launch sometime in 2019.\n\n, TeamIndus was working towards developing the hardware and launching the mission sometime in 2019, possibly in partnership with Synergy Moon. By March 2018, the organisation had raised $23 million USD, but are in need of additional $35 million USD. They have not selected and contracted a launch vehicle yet.\n\nThe lander is code-named HHK1, and their single rover is called ECA, an abbreviation for \"Ek Choti si Asha\" (\"A Small Hope\"). Cruise to the Moon would take 10 days, and the spacecraft would initially be maneuvered into a lunar parking orbit and gradually settle to a circular orbit about 100 km from the surface. The spacecraft has a liquid rocket engine with a thrust capability of 440 N for deceleration, and sixteen small 22 N thrusters for finer orbital maneuvers and attitude control (orientation). Then the lander would perform a soft landing at a location yet to be determined. The planned mission duration is about 10 days cruise, 10 days lunar orbit maneuvering, and 10 days surface operations.\n\nThe spacecraft will carry \"a suite of commercial and experimental payloads.\" The HHK-1 lander may include a small ultraviolet telescope called Lunar Ultraviolet Cosmic Imager (LUCI) that was developed by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics. In June 2016 a letter of intent was signed with the French space agency CNES to carry the Color CMOS Camera for Space Exploration (\"CASPEX\") micro-camera on board the team's rover, and the signed agreement was announced in 9 January 2017, specifying that the French agency would contribute two CASPEX cameras for the ECA rover. From 2016 to 2017, TeamIndus ran a competition called \"Lab2Moon\" which aimed to select scientific experiments that will be carried to the Moon. Space4Life, from Italy and Team ZΩI (team zoi) from Kolkata, India were chosen as winners in 2017. Space4Life will test the potential to use cyanobacteria as an shield against radiation, while Team ZΩI's experiment will conduct photosynthesis on the Moon.\n\n"}

In December 1900 a lighthouse supply ship called the \"Hesperus\", based in Stromness, Orkney, went on its routine tour of duty to the Flannan Isles in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. The lighthouse was empty - all three beds and the table looked as if they had been left in a hurry and the lamp, though out, was in perfect working order, but the men had disappeared into thin air. The composer has taken liberties, and changed the name of the lighthouse to Fladda, this being not a usual name in the Western Isles of Scotland, to avoid offence or distress to any relatives of those concerned in the original incident.\n\nIt was first performed in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 2 September 1980 as part of the Edinburgh Festival. The singers were Neil Mackie (tenor), Michael Rippon (baritone) and David Wilson-Johnson (bass-baritone) with The Fires of London conducted by Richard Dufallo.\n\nIn 1983 the Boston Shakespeare Company presented a production directed by Peter Sellars featuring Michael Brown (tenor), Sanford Sylvan (baritone), Kenneth Bell (bass), conducted by David Hoose, video by Michael Nishball, costumes by Ellen McCartney and lighting by James F. Ingalls. Writing for \"The New York Times\", John Rockwell described the production as \"superbly realized musically and thrilling as theater.\" Another Boston company, Boston Lyric Opera gave two performances in February 2012.\n\nThe Chicago Opera Theater presented a production in 1990.\n\nThe Dallas Opera gave three performances of the work as part of its \"Chamber Opera Series\" in March 2012.\n\nEnglish Touring Opera, which is based in London, presented two performances there in October 2012 along with five others in different English locations in October and November.\n\nThe opera opens with a prologue in which three officers (tenor, baritone and bass) address a board of inquiry. They relate their voyage to the dark lighthouse and the discovery that the crew was missing, but become increasingly nervous answering the questions put to them by the orchestra's French horn and begin to contradict each other on details. Nevertheless, an open verdict is recorded and the trio sing of the ghost's modern robot replacement.\n\nThe lantern comes up to full brightness and the second half, subtitled \"The Cry of the Beast\", opens in the lighthouse. Arthur (bass) is leading grace and Blazes (baritone) is complaining of the food and the overdue relief crew, while Sandy (tenor) tries to keep peace between the two. He proposes a game of crib, and the sanctimonious Arthur leaves to light the lantern, issuing dire predictions as the offstage Voice of the Cards. He returns just as a fight breaks out over a card palmed by Blazes. Sandy proposes they pass the time with songs \"lest we end up like beasts in a cage, eating each other\". Blazes agrees: \"...then we shall see who is king, who devil, and who the fool amongst us.\" He sings first, with \"When I was a kid our street had a gang\". Accompanied by 'bones, fiddle, and banjo, it relates a murder committed by Blazes, for which his father was arrested and hanged.\n\nSandy takes his turn with a sentimental love ballad accompanied by cello and piano. The three stanzas turn into a less innocent catch when taken up by the other two: \"...O, that you held me...by the cock...I come...crowing loud...I am aroused\". Arthur counters with a Salvation Army song on The Golden Calf (brass, clarinet and tambourine) in which he seems personally to glory in the smiting of the Levites. With dismay the three notice the fog coming in – the horn must now be started, summoning first the Blazes' ghosts, then Sandy's memories of his sister and a schoolmate. To Arthur, the horn summons the Golden Calf which he sees moving across the waters to claim them. \"The only cure is to kill the beast!\" he cries, enlisting the others to arm themselves and advance, singing a \"De profundis\", into the night, toward its dazzling bright eye.\n\nWhen the music calms, the light is seen to belong to the relief ship and the three relief officers are visible. \"We had to defend ourselves, by God!\" They agree on their story and tidy up quickly.\n\nThe six regular players of The Fires of London were augmented to 12 as follows: flute doubling piccolo and alto flute, clarinet in A doubling bass clarinet in B; horn in F, trumpet in C, and trombone; solo strings (violin, viola, cello, double bass); piano doubling celesta and out of tune upright piano, guitar doubling banjo.\n\nThe percussion comprised marimba, glockenspiel, timpani, crotales, rototom, bass drum, bones, small suspended cymbal, side drum, tambourine, maracas, tom-toms and tamtam, all played by one percussionist, and in addition flexatone and referee's whistle (pianist), bass drum (guitarist), tamtam (violinist), and two more flexatones (violist).\n\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}
