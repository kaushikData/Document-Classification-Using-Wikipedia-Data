{"id": "27381928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27381928", "title": "Avalanche (phishing group)", "text": "Avalanche (phishing group)\n\nAvalanche was a criminal syndicate involved in phishing attacks, online bank fraud, and ransomware. The name also refers to the network of owned, rented, and compromised systems used to carry out that activity. Avalanche only infected computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system. \n\nIn November 2016, the Avalanche botnet was destroyed after a four-year project by an international consortium of law enforcement, commercial, academic, and private organizations.\n\nAvalanche was discovered in December 2008, and may have been a replacement for a phishing group known as Rock Phish which stopped operating in 2008. It was run from Eastern Europe and was given its name by security researchers because of the high volume of its attacks. Avalanche launched 24% of phishing attacks in the first half of 2009; in the second half of 2009, the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) recorded 84,250 attacks by Avalanche, constituting 66% of all phishing attacks. The number of total phishing attacks more than doubled, an increase which the APWG directly attributes to Avalanche.\n\nAvalanche used spam email purporting to come from trusted organisations such as financial institutions or employment websites. Victims were deceived into entering personal information on websites made to appear as though they belong to these organisations. They were sometimes tricked into installing software attached to the emails or at a website. The malware logged keystrokes, stole passwords and credit card information, and allowed unauthorised remote access to the infected computer.\n\nInternet Identity's Phishing Trends report for the second quarter of 2009 said that Avalanche \"have detailed knowledge of commercial banking platforms, particularly treasury management systems and the Automated Clearing House (ACH) system. They are also performing successful real-time man-in-the-middle attacks that defeat two-factor security tokens.\"\n\nAvalanche had many similarities to the previous group Rock Phish - the first phishing group which used automated techniques - but with greater in scale and volume. Avalanche hosted its domains on compromised computers (a botnet). There was no single hosting provider, making difficult to take down the domain and requiring the involvement of the responsible domain registrar.\n\nIn addition, Avalanche used fast-flux DNS, causing the compromised machines to change constantly. Avalanche attacks also spread the Zeus Trojan horse enabling further criminal activity. The majority of domains which Avalanche used belonged to national domain name registrars in Europe and Asia. This differs from other phishing attacks, where the majority of domains use U.S. registrars. It appears that Avalanche chose registrars based on their security procedures, returning repeatedly to registrars which do not detect domains being used for fraud, or which were slow to suspend abusive domains.\n\nAvalanche frequently registered domains with multiple registrars, while testing others to check whether their distinctive domains were being detected and blocked. They targeted a small number financial institutions at a time, but rotated these regularly. A domain which not suspended by a registrar was re-used in later attacks. The group created a phishing \"kit\", which came pre-prepared for use against many victim institutions.\n\nAvalanche attracted significant attention from security organisations; as a result, the uptime of the domain names it used was half that of other phishing domains.\n\nIn October 2009, ICANN, the organisation which manages the assignment of domain names, issued a Situation Awareness Note encouraging registrars to be pro-active in dealing with Avalanche attacks. The UK registry, Nominet has changed its procedures to make it easier to suspend domains, because of attacks by Avalanche. Interdomain, a Spanish registrar, began requiring a confirmation code delivered by mobile phone in April 2009 which successfully forced Avalanche to stop registering fraudulent domains with them.\n\nIn 2010, the APWG reported that Avalanche had been responsible for two-thirds of all phishing attacks in the second half of 2009, describing it as \"one of the most sophisticated and damaging on the Internet\" and \"the world's most prolific phishing gang\".\n\nIn November 2009, security companies managed to shut down the Avalanche botnet for a short time; after this Avalanche reduced the scale of its activities and altered its \"modus operandi\". By April 2010, attacks by Avalanche had decreased to just 59 from a high of more than 26,000 in October 2009, but the decrease was temporary.\n\nOn November 30, 2016, the Avalanche botnet was destroyed at the end of a four-year project by INTERPOL, Europol, the Shadowserver Foundation, Eurojust, the Luneberg (Germany) police, The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), the Fraunhofer FKIE, several antivirus companies organized by Symantec, ICANN, CERT, the FBI, and some of the domain registries that had been used by the group.\n\nSymantec reverse-engineered the client malware and the consortium analyzed 130 TB of data captured during those years. This allowed it to defeat the fast-flux distributed DNS obfuscation, map the command/control structure of the botnet, and identify its numerous physical servers.\n\n37 premises were searched, 39 servers were seized, 221 rented servers were removed from the network when their unwitting owners were notified, 500,000 zombie computers were freed from remote control, 17 families of malware were deprived of c/c, and the five people who ran the botnet were arrested.\n\nThe law enforcement sinkhole server, described in 2016 as the \"largest ever\", with 800,000 domains served, collects the IP addresses of infected computers that request instructions from the botnet so that the ISPs owning them can inform users that their machines are infected and provide removal software.\n\nThe following malware families were hosted on Avalanche:\n\nThe Avalanche network also provided the c/c communications for these other botnets:\n\n"}
{"id": "19343738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19343738", "title": "Bacall to Arms", "text": "Bacall to Arms\n\nBacall to Arms is a 1946 Warner Bros. cartoon in the Merrie Melodies series, co-planned by Bob Clampett, in his second-to-last cartoon at Warner Bros. (\"The Big Snooze\" would be the last) and Tex Avery, finished by Arthur Davis and supervised by Friz Freleng. Neither Clampett (he was left uncredited because he had left the studio before the cartoon was released) nor voice characterizations are credited. Mel Blanc's voice is recognizable as a fat theater patron, a husband in a newsreel, and the wolf's vocal effects. Impressionist Dave Barry portrays the voice of Humphrey Bogart while June Foray voices Lauren Bacall. The title refers both to Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" and actress Lauren Bacall, whose acclaimed film debut was in \"To Have and Have Not\", based on another Hemingway novel, as well as a play on the term \"A Call to Arms\".\n\nBob Clampett started his directing career with black-and-white animated shorts for the Looney Tunes series, this phase of his career lasting from 1937 to 1941. In 1941, fellow director Tex Avery departed the Warner Bros. Cartoons studio. Clampett replaced Avery as the head of a unit producing films for the Merrie Melodies series, while Norman McCabe took over Clampett's former unit. The chief animator of Clampett's new unit was Robert McKimson.\n\nThe cartoon is set in a movie theater. Various random gags occur before the film, such as one patron moving to another seat another patron taking the vacated seat, and so on, accelerating into a free-for-all. A wolf makes a pass at a sexy movie usherette, gets slapped in the face, then settles down for the show. While the theater is in color, the films-within-the film are black-and-white. A short \"newsreel\" is narrated by Robert C. Bruce.\n\nThe main feature is a film called \"To Have- To Have- To Have- ...\", a parody of \"To Have and Have Not\". It includes images of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, who are credited as \"Bogey Gocart and Laurie Becool\". In addition to recreating a few well-known scenes from that film (the kissing scene; the \"put your lips together and blow\" scene), the players sometimes lapse into slapstick (Bacall lighting her cigarette with a blowtorch à la Harpo Marx; or letting loose with a loud, shrill whistle after her famous sultry comment) and interact with the theater audience.\n\nAlthough the theater was initially full, it is eventually seen to be empty except for one patron: a literal lone wolf in a zoot suit who goes ga-ga over Bacall. The final gag has the wolf grabbing a cigarette that was dropped in the film and jumps off the screen, and Bogie shoots him. He hands it to Bogie and it explodes, covering him with \"blackface\". Bogie suddenly adopts a \"Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson\" voice, and says, \"Mah, oh mah! I can work fo' Mr. Benny nah!\"\n\nThe film reuses animation from an earlier short, \"She Was an Acrobat's Daughter\" (1937) by Friz Freleng. Like its 1930s predecessor, the film depicts a noisy movie audience member which disrupts the screening. In this case the noisy audience is represented by the wolf-whistling and howling of a wolf in the audience. The film uses caricatures of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, who attempt to act out the scene from \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944) in which they first kiss, and her character's advice on how to whistle. Bogart eventually shoots the disruptive wolf from the movie screen, though the film within a film never properly ends. The short is one of two memorable parodies of Bogart from the Warner Bros. Cartoons studio. The other was \"Slick Hare\" (1947), where restaurant customer Bogart demands \"fried rabbit\" from Elmer Fudd. Setting up a plot where both Fudd and Bogart chase after Bugs Bunny.\n\nThe film functions as a tribute to Bacall and her sexual attractiveness. It was probably produced to promote the release of an upcoming feature film, \"The Big Sleep\" (1946). The film conflates two scenes from \"To Have and Have Not\", the scene where the protagonist are introduced to each other and the whistle scene. In the original film, Bogart cleans a fishing reel. In the parody, he cleans a .45 caliber handgun. In a reference to Bacall's \"hotness\", when her caricature crosses the floor, she leaves a trail of flames behind her. While the film within a film is black-and-white, making it the last Warner Bros. cartoon in black-and-white, the flames are red and yellow. When she asks for a light, the Bogart caricature offers her a blow torch. She easily catches it and uses the torch to light her cigarette.\n\nThe distinctive voice of Eddie \"Rochester\" Anderson is used here to accompany a blackface-related visual gag. Christopher Lehman notes that it was typical for blackface gags in animated films to make references to well-known African American actors. References to both Anderson and Stepin Fetchit were frequently used. He notes, however, that the creators of Warner Bros. Cartoons found comedic use for Anderson's voice and ethnicity. But never for the intelligence or wit of his character, Rochester. Which he finds rather telling.\n\nAuthor Don Peri points that in the 1930s, Walt Disney Productions was the industry leader in character animation. But as this studio's focus shifted from animated shorts to animated feature films, other studios started making their own advances in the field. At times depicting emotions that were absent from Disney films. Peri cites \"Bacall to Arms\" as a memorable depiction of lust in animation. The wolf himself seems similar to \"Wolfie\" by Tex Avery.\n\nWorld War II ended in August 1945, but several animated shorts released later in that year and into 1946 still contained war-related references. In \"Bacall to Arms\" there is a newsreel featuring \"wartime inventions put to peacetime use\". The example depicted is that of a married man who uses a radar to receive early warnings for the unannounced visits of his mother-in-law.\n\nNorman Klein cites the film as an example of animated films referencing film noir and figures associated with the genre, such as Bogart. He argues that screwball comedy film, the chase-themed animated films, the crime film, and film noir were genres which shared certain elements. In his view, all were reactions to the melodrama films of the 1930s and all rejected the moralizing tendecies of these melodramas. They reacted by embracing depictions of outrageous behavior and amorality. Common themes among them were the depiction of poetic justice as malum in se, of faked sentiment as a tool of deception, and sardonicism as the primary form of humor.\n\n\n\n"}

The business was set up and run by Kautilya Nandan Pruthi, a London-based Indian businessman, in partnership with Kenneth Peacock and John Anderson, who both lived in Sunningdale, Surrey.\n\nBased from rented offices at 1 Relton Mews, Knightsbridge, the proposal of BCI was that clients lent it money, so that BCI in turn could lend that money at very high rates of interest to \"distressed\" businesses that found themselves unable to borrow from banks for short periods of time.\nPruthi through BCI offered investors a return of between 4% and 20% a month on short-term fixed deposits of between four weeks and a year, while Anderson and Peacock through their own consulting companies promised slightly lower rates, passing on their deposits directly to Pruthi.\n\nIn the last three years of operation (2005–November 2008), the partners each attracted:\n\nPeacock, a member of Surrey County Cricket Club, lured in many sports personalities to the scheme. The three partners would also meet regularly at Lord’s and the Oval cricket ground, where they would also meet potential investors. Pruthi additionally bought Apex Motorsports, in which he invested the funds, and to which he invited investment clients to participate in various UK and global motorsports events.\n\nCelebrity clients included the former cricketer Darren Gough, and the actor Jerome Flynn, who invested with fellow members of the Ratu Bagus religious sect.\n\nIn November 2008, BCI and the partners' assets were frozen to allow an investigation to be undertaken by the City of London Police. Lodging papers at the High Court, the Financial Services Authority accused BCI and its partners of illegally accepting deposits for a collective investment scheme in contravention of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, as they were not authorised to operate such an enterprise.\n\nDespite working in the same offices, Pruthi immediately claimed that Anderson and Peacock operated independently of him and so there was no such organised \"scheme\". The three also counter-argued that the monies were never pooled to be \"collectively\" invested, and so they could not have breached the Act.\n\nThe FSA started a search for the invested monies, which globally extended to Dubai, the Cayman Islands, Thailand and Bermuda. In the UK they seized: £1 million in jewellery; £250,000 in cash; and 16 cars, including Bentleys, two Ferraris, and a Lamborghini. Pruthi was the sole shareholder of Relton Mews Air Ltd, a Bermuda-based company that owned a twin-engine Cessna Citation I jet aircraft, registered as VP-BGE. This aircraft crashed near Biggin Hill Airport, Kent, on 30 March 2008, killing five people, including: David Leslie, a touring car driver; Richard Lloyd, a racing driver and APEX team co-owner; and Chris Allarton, a data engineer. They were travelling to the Nogaro Circuit in France to test for Apex Motorsport in preparation for the FIA GT3 European Championship. Any monies from a $1 million (£610,000) insurance claim for the aircraft will now be deposited with the FSA.\n\nOn 25 March 2010, the High Court ruled that Pruthi, Anderson and Peacock, trading as Business Consulting International, John Anderson Consulting and Kenneth Peacock Consulting, were unlawfully accepting deposits from UK consumers.\n\nOn 29 June 2010, the High Court declared that the three must pay the FSA £115M within a defined period, split: Pruthi £89.8M; Anderson £13.2M; Peacock £11.6M. But on failing to do so, the High Court declared each of them bankrupt, to allow the FSA to recover the maximum amount of client funds.\n\nOn 30 July 2010, Pruthi was charged with 30 fraud offences including running a bogus business, money laundering and obtaining money by deception, later released on bail. The main trial was scheduled for early 2012 at Southwark Crown Court, in front of Judge Michael Gledhill QC, to allow time for the FSA to recover funds.\n\nOn 30 January 2012, before the trial began, Pruthi pleaded guilty in a pre-trial hearing to: four specimen counts of obtaining money transfers by deception; one count of participating in a fraudulent business; one count of unauthorised regulated activity; and one count of converting and removing criminal property. On 5 March, Anderson and Peacock were convicted of unauthorised regulated activity, in a scheme masterminded by Pruthi. On 7 March, Anderson and Peacock were found not guilty of recklessly making a misleading, false or deceptive promise. Jurors also cleared them of one count each of fraud.\n"}

The Musical (originally known as Alferd Packer: The Musical) is a 1993 American independent black comedy horror musical film directed, written, produced, co-scored by and starring Trey Parker while studying at the University of Colorado at Boulder, before reaching fame with \"South Park\" alongside his friend Matt Stone who also stars in and produced the film. It is loosely based on the true story of Alferd Packer and the sordid details of the trip from Utah to Colorado that left his five fellow travelers dead and partially eaten. Trey Parker (credited as Juan Schwartz) stars as Alferd Packer, with frequent collaborators Stone, Dian Bachar, and others playing the supporting roles.\n\nIn 2001, a stage production was staged Off-Broadway at the Kraine Theater on East 4th Street in New York. The show continued to find small theaters and audiences across America and beyond for many years.\n\nA large-scale stage production was produced by The Rival Theatre Company at the 2008 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It featured West End performers. It was executive produced by Jason McHugh and directed by Frazer Brown.\n\nIn 2011, producer Jason McHugh released a book titled, \"Shpadoinkle: The Making of Cannibal! The Musical,\" which chronicles all aspects of the creation and continuation of the Cannibal! The Musical cult phenomenon.\n\nThe film begins with a reenactment of the gruesome events of cannibalism as described by the prosecuting attorney during Alferd Packer's trial in 1883. Packer insists that things happened differently than what has been recounted, and begins to tell his story to journalist Polly Pry through flashback (\"Shpadoinkle\").\n\nIn 1873, a group of miners in Bingham Canyon, Utah hear of new gold discoveries in Breckenridge and decide to travel to Colorado Territory to stake a claim. After the original guide, Lucky Larry, dies from a lightning strike, Packer is nominated as the replacement since he claimed knowledge of the area (\"Shpadoinkle [Reprise]\"). He and his trusty horse, Liane, set off on what Packer estimates will be a three-week journey with a party of five miners: Shannon Wilson Bell, an aspiring Mormon priest; James Humphrey, who was forced by his father to join the party; Frank Miller, a cynical butcher who reluctantly joins their party at the mine; George Noon, a teenager hoping to meet women in Breckenridge; and Israel Swan, an optimist.\n\nFour weeks later, while attempting to visit Provo for supplies they become convinced they are lost. An attempt to ask a local for directions to Provo proves unsuccessful, with the local warning them of impending doom awaiting them in the mountains. Finally arriving at a frontier post in Provo, they run into a group of three fur trappers bound for Saguache; O.D. Loutzenheiser, Preston Nutter, and their diminutive leader, Jean \"Frenchy\" Cabazon. The trappers despise the miners, whom they contemptuously call \"diggers\", yet seem to like Packer’s horse, telling Packer that she's a \"trapper horse\". Making camp, Packer and company reveal their goals for traveling to each other in song (\"That's All I'm Asking For\"). The next day, Packer wakes up to discover his horse and friend, Liane, is missing. After Bell wounds his leg in a bear trap, the men attempt to cross the Green River near the Utah border. The group asks Packer if there are any other big rivers that they will have to cross to which he replies, “Oh no, just the Colorado River.” They camp out for the night after their crossing, with Packer singing a heartfelt song about Liane (\"Ode to Liane\"). Eventually, after a disastrous crossing of the Colorado River the Packer party is spotted by two “Nihonjin” Indians (obviously played by Japanese actors and speaking Japanese). They are taken back to the tribe's encampment near Delta where the chief warns them of a winter storm, allowing them to wait it out with the tribe. Packer's party also find the trappers camping out with the tribe, who proceed to brag about their lives in song before a small altercation breaks out over Liane, whose feedbag Packer finds in their possession (\"Trapper Song\").\n\nThe story returns to the present time, where Packer is sentenced to death by hanging, with his execution to occur in Lake City. That night, alone, Polly muses over the case and Packer's testimony, and she reveals her growing affection for him through song (\"This Side of Me\"). The next day, Polly visits Packer once again in prison, where he continues his story.\n\nThe men set out in the wilderness after Packer learns the trappers have already left, persuading them to leave under the guise of there being a break in the storm. The group begins to suspect that Packer is really only interested in following the trappers to find his horse. They soldier on until they encounter a foreboding \"Cyclops\", a tall man with a wounded eye, while unwittingly trying to steal one of his sheep for sustenance. The Cyclops recalls how a Union soldier shot out his eye in the Civil War, and becomes enraged when he realizes Packer's men are not “Southern boys” after they can not finish the lyrics to \"Dixie\", causing them to flee. They escape and the badly frostbitten Swan tries to cheer everybody up with a song about building a snowman (\"Let's Build a Snowman\"). They soon run out of food, resorting to eating their shoes as they become lost in the snow-covered Rocky Mountains. Out of frustration, Bell shoots Swan in the head because he does not appreciate his (Swan's) Pollyanna-esque perspective on their predicament (\"Let's Build a Snowman [Reprise]\"). The men discuss their dire situation that night over the fire, speaking of the cannibalism that the Donner Party had to resort to in California. They decide to consume the body of their dead companion (but “not the butt”) as Miller cuts up Swan's body, and only Bell refuses to partake in the cannibalism. Packer then has a ballet-inspired nightmare involving himself, Liane, and Cabazon. A few more days leads to talk of sacrificing one of their own. Packer convinces them for one more chance for a scouting trip, but when he returns, Bell has killed the others, claiming they planned to kill and eat him after Packer left. Packer is forced to kill Bell after threatening to turn him in, realizing he has gone insane. He is then forced to cannibalize the others to wait out the rest of the winter.\n\nArriving in Saguache sometime later, Packer finds Liane, who has taken to Cabazon, upsetting Packer. The sheriff of Saguache, suspicious of Packer arriving without the rest of his party, eventually finds out the fate of the other members and attempts to arrest Packer for cannibalism at a saloon. A bar-fight between Packer and the trappers (and some of the bar patrons, including the Cyclops from earlier) occurs, which Packer wins after brutally attacking Cabazon's groin using fighting techniques he learned from the Nihonjin chief, leaving Cabazon incapacitated with a high-pitched voice. Following this, Packer attempts to flee to Wyoming, only to later be arrested there and brought back to Colorado to await judgement. On the day of Packer's execution in Lake City, the town breaks into song, celebrating Packer's impending death (\"Hang the Bastard\"). However, he is saved at the last minute by Polly, who arrives on the scene with Liane. Polly reveals that Packer had gotten a stay of execution from the governor stating that he could not be convicted of a state crime since Colorado was not a state at the time of the incident. Meanwhile Cabazon, who wants revenge against Packer for their fight in Saguache, claims the townsfolk came to see bloodshed and tries to trigger the gallows. The Nihonjin chief saves Packer by cutting his rope with a katana before beheading Cabazon, satisfying the crowd's blood-lust. Packer, seeing that Polly brought back Liane, realizes he doesn't need her anymore and chooses Polly (much to the excitement of the chief, who takes off after Liane with his katana), and the two kiss, only to be frightened by a still-alive Bell (\"Shpadoinkle [Finale]\").\n\n\n\nContrasting with the musical's generally dark and morbid humor are its cheerful songs, all composed by Parker, including \"Let's Build a Snowman\", \"Ode to Liane\", \"Hang the Bastard\", and \"Shpadoinkle\" (pronounced \"shpah-doink-ul\"). The last of these is a transparent parody of the song \"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning\" from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical \"Oklahoma!\".\n\nTwo songs that were originally going to be in the film, but later taken out, were \"Shatterproof\" and \"Don't Be Stupid\". An interview with Ian Keldin said that Trey thought \"Shatterproof\" (which was going to be a rap song sung by Packer during the bar fight scene) made Packer seem too tough.\n\nThe film began as a 3-minute trailer made for a film class. After the trailer drew much attention, Parker and Stone raised around $125,000 and began shooting the full-length film. The film was shot during weekends and on spring break in 1993, and according to Ian Hardin, most of the crew failed their film history class as a result. Early in shooting, Parker was thrown from one of the horses playing \"Liane\", fracturing his hip.\n\nThis film was originally titled \"Alferd Packer: The Musical\" in 1993. The film premiered on October 31, 1993, in Boulder, Colorado, at a cinema near the University of Colorado campus. A fake protest organized by friends of Parker and Stone, organized along the lines of an animal rights demonstration, took place in front of the theater. The film then played at Raindance Film Festival in October 2004. Parker and Stone attended.\n\nParker was credited onscreen as Juan Schwartz, a reference to Alferd Packer's alias \"John Schwartze\", which he was living under when discovered in Cheyenne, Wyoming.\n\nIt was not released generally until 1996, however, when Troma Entertainment picked it up and renamed it \"Cannibal! The Musical\" out of concern that not enough people outside of Colorado knew who Packer was. Few people outside of Colorado ever saw the film since Troma did not distribute it widely. Parker and Stone's animated satire \"South Park\" debuted the following year.\n\nSeveral live productions of the show have been mounted, with excerpts from one live version available on the DVD.\n\nFollowing Matt and Trey's success with \"South Park\", Troma re-released the film on VHS and DVD and it enjoyed a decent cult following. The DVD contains a \"Drunken Director's Commentary\" where Parker and Stone along with most of the cast get drunk as they watch the film, although there are a few times when the commentary cuts out (either because the recorder was turned off or they spoke of things they later decided nobody should hear).\n\nThe film has since been released on UMD for the Sony PSP. A special edition 13th anniversary DVD was released by Troma with added features, including all new interviews with the cast and crew.\n\nThe film was re-released on November 2008 as the first of the \"Tromasterpiece Collection,\" as Troma considers \"Cannibal!\" to be one of its best films. Included in the new two-disc version, with over three hours of special features, never-before-seen deleted material and stage shows. Songs such as \"Shatter Proof\" and the early short films of Parker and Stone were considered to be a part of the new DVD, but these additions were ultimately rejected.\n\nThere have been several amateur productions of \"Cannibal! The Musical\" since 1996. The first was at the Sierra College in Northern California and then at Dad's Garage Theater where it won accolades by fans and the press.\n\nIn 2001, Saturday Players launched a six-month off-off-Broadway run of the show that earned critical acclaim and returning audience members.\n\nIn 2004, \"Cannibal\" made its European debut in Rome at the Teatro di Servi.\n\nIn 2005, the first High School group attempted the show at The Ironwood Ridge High School in Tucson, Arizona, but the show was censored by the school and performed off campus as a benefit. Later that year the show made its German debut at the University of Regensburg and played many small colleges and community houses in the US.\n\nIn 2006, the show debuted at its first Fringe Festivals in Minneapolis and Victoria, Canada and continued to find adoption by small colleges and community theaters.\n\nIn 2008, The Insurgo Theater Movement launched the show in Las Vegas for the first of several runs by their company. Unexpected Productions launched the first of four October runs of Cannibal in Seattle.\n\nAlso in 2008, The Rival Theatre Company produced the first large-scale professional production. The show ran from July 31 to August 25 at the George Square Theatre, Edinburgh for a total of 26 performances. It starred Aimie Atkinson as Polly Pry and James Topping as Alferd Packer. Original film cast member Jason McHugh made a guest appearance as Mr. Mills. Other guest stars included Jim Bowen and The Q Brothers.\n\nThis production was planned a six-week run to the West End from July 27, 2010, at the Leicester Square Theatre. However, after copyright holder Jason McHugh withdrew the rights in May 2010, the show was canceled.\n\nIn 2011, M.P.M.M. Productions, performed the musical in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada during the 2011 Winnipeg Fringe Festival. It won \"The Best of Fest\" for its venue (meaning it outsold other shows in the venue and was awarded an additional show). The show also debuted in St Louis and Denver with great reviews and enthusiastic casts and audience members.\n\nIn May 2012, Logan Donahoo Presents performed a version of the musical in Orlando, Florida during the 2012 Orlando International Fringe Theatre Festival, in the Yellow venue. The show was successful, receiving positive reviews, and winning Patron's Pick for its venue, meaning that it had outsold all of the other shows and was awarded an additional performance.\n\n\"Trey Parker’s Cannibal! The Musical\" played in Toronto at David Mirvish's Panasonic Theatre for a four-week run (February 10 to March 8, 2015). Additional book, lyrics, and music by Christopher Bond, Aaron Eyre, and Trevor Martin.\n\nIt was announced in early 2014 that a production of the show is being produced at the Waterfront Theatre in Vancouver, B.C. by independent traveling theatre troupe Last Chance Productions. The show will run between June 12, 2014, until 8 March 2015, with two separate seating areas (a \"Gore Zone\" where audience members are subject to splash-zone-esque involvement, and a less messy \"Gore-Free Zone\".)\n\n\"Cannibal!\" currently holds a 63% \"Fresh\" approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews. The site's critical consensus says: \"If you're only going to watch one black comedy about a real-life explorer whose fellow travelers ended up eaten, make it \"Cannibal! The Musical\".\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54689553", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54689553", "title": "Caviar diplomacy", "text": "Caviar diplomacy\n\nCaviar diplomacy is the lobbying strategy of Azerbaijan, consisting of costly invitations of foreign politicians and employees of international organizations to Azerbaijan at the expense of the host country. Caviar Diplomacy also includes expensive gifts presented as “a tribute to the Eastern tradition.”\n\nThe term “caviar diplomacy” was first used in 2012, in a report by the European Stability Initiative (ESI) – “Caviar Diplomacy – How Azerbaijan silenced the Council of Europe”. It was noted in the report that this term is being used in informal conversations of Azerbaijani officials to describe generous gifts to foreign politicians.\n\nAccording to the sources of the European Stability Initiative, Azerbaijan has a group of 10-12 friends in PACE and 3-4 people in the secretariat who receive at least half a kilogram of black caviar (the price on the market is more than 1300 euros per kilogram) as a gift four times a year. Many deputies are invited to Baku and during their visits receive, alongside the caviar, numerous other gifts including: expensive silk carpets, gold and silver items, drinks, caviar and money. In Baku, a common gift is 2 kg of caviar. According to the ESI, outside of PACE, there is no doubt about the situation with democracy in Azerbaijan, which is characterized as semi-authoritarian even by its biggest supporters. Nevertheless, despite the fact that there were no opposition parties elected to the Azerbaijani parliament in 2010, the head of the PACE mission stated that the elections corresponded to international standards. According to the ESI, this can be explained only by “caviar diplomacy”.\nThe ESI cited an example of PACE discussions in its report, when Azerbaijan was publicly supported by its frequent visitors – British Liberal Democrat Michael Hancock and former Foreign Minister of Estonia Cristina Oyuland, who, despite the obvious regression in human rights situation in Azerbaijan, the lack of free elections, as well as criticism from international human rights organizations, stated that there are no serious problems in Azerbaijan. The ESI also added to the list of “friends of Azerbaijan” the Belgian Paul Vitte, from Bavaria, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu from Turkey, Robert Walter from Britain, and a number of Russian representatives.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential elections, PACE observers included a large group of frankly pro-Azerbaijani MPs. The variant of the statement on elections, prepared by the head of the group of observers Andreas Herkel, containing critical remarks, faced the rejection of the pro-Azerbaijani group consisting of Michael Hancock, Eduard Lintner and Paul Ville. Herkel was forced to declare his resignation if criticism did not go into the statement. During the referendum, which lifted the limits on the number of presidential terms for Ilham Aliyev, four PACE deputies – Eduard Litner, Paul Ville, Khaki Keskin and Pedro Agramunt evaluated the referendum as the progress of democracy.\n\nIn addition to PACE representatives, observers from the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE (ODIHR) who have extensive experience of such observations, which revealed numerous violations of the procedure, which exclude the possibility of choice, were also present at the 2010 parliamentary elections. During the meetings of European observers, attended by PACE representatives in the person of Paul Ville and Pole Tadeusz Ivinski, the head of ODIHR observers, Audrey Glover from Great Britain, noted numerous violations that were not contested by PACE representatives. Nevertheless, the preliminary result of PACE monitoring, presented by Paul Ville, noted the compliance of preparations for elections with international standards, as well as transparent and effective work of the organizers. During the election, ODIHR observers recorded multiple violations and unprecedented ballot stuffing. By the closing of polling stations, the elections were assessed by the ODIHR as probably the most fraudulent they monitored. However, speaking on Azerbaijani television, Paul Ville stated that the elections were democratic and that he did not know about any violations. The ODIHR, in turn, subjected the elections to sharp criticism.\n\nWhen asked if bribes were given to observers, Glover replied that she had not personally received it. After returning from Baku, representative of the PACE group Wolfgang Grosruck accused Audrey Glovek of being “unreliable”, unprofessional, and also of not speaking out in defense of PACE representatives when the questions about bribes were asked. The ODIHR report published in January 2011 contained extremely critical assessments of the 2010 elections.\n\nInvestigations of the ESI have received resonance in Russian and international media: \"EU Observer\", \"Politiken\", DK, Radio Sarajevo, BBC, \"Der Tagesspiegel\", Africa Intelligence, \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\", \"The Guardian\" and others.\n\nOn October 9, 2013, Ilham Aliyev was elected Azerbaijan’s president for the third time. Observers from the OSCE / ODIHR, led by Tana de Zulueta, spoke of restrictions on freedom of speech during elections, while representatives of the European Parliament headed by Pino Arlacchi confirmed free and fair elections. The European Parliament and PACE issued a joint statement in which they highly appraised the elections. A group of observers from the US House of Representatives also acknowledged fair elections.\n\nVarying estimates of the elections led to a scandal. On October 11, the representative of the European Union, Catherine Ashton and European Commissioner Stefan Fule, ignored the assessment of the European Parliament, including in its statement the results of the ODIHR. The Commission on Foreign Relations of the EU discussed the report of Arlacchi. During the discussion, representatives of the “green” condemned the report and said that it discredited the European Parliament. The head of the Socialists’ faction in the EU said that the PACE report cannot be considered reliable at all. It later emerged that a number of EU representatives traveled to Azerbaijan unofficially and on the dime of Azerbaijani organizations, which was regarded by the “European Voice” as “stupidity or corruption”, these trips were labeled “electoral tourism”.\n\nThe US State Department in its turn discredited the observers from the House of Representatives, describing the elections as not meeting international standards, and expressing solidarity with the ODIHR's assessment.\n\nIn 2015, during the discussion of the resolution on political prisoners in the European Parliament, the text written by the pro-Azerbaijani rapporteurs initially contained almost no criticism, but as a result, a resolution was adopted calling for Azerbaijan to stop repression of human rights defenders, revising the law on non-governmental organizations, not putting pressure on journalists and there was also a threat of sanctions. According to the German deputy Frank Schwab, this was a turning point for Azerbaijan's “caviar diplomacy”.\n\nOn September 10, 2015, the European Parliament adopted a resolution in which Azerbaijan was condemned for “unprecedented repression”. The resolution also called on the European authorities to conduct a thorough investigation of allegations of corruption against President Aliyev and his family members, and to consider imposing targeted sanctions against officials related to the persecution.\n\nIn June 2016, the Milan prosecutor's office brought charges of corruption and money laundering to Luca Volonte, the former head of the European People's Party faction in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. According to the Prosecutor's Office Volonte received €2.39 million for the support of Azerbaijani officials. Volonte’s lawyers called these accusations absolutely groundless. According to the second ESI report – “Caviar Diplomacy. Part 2”, published in December 2016, Volonte agreed to cooperate with the investigation and named many European politicians who have been lobbying for the interests of the Azerbaijani authorities. During the interrogations Volonte confirmed receiving €2.39 million for lobbying in favor of Azerbaijan. According to the ESI, the money went to bribing Italian and other politicians who voted against PACE resolutions and reports condemning human rights violations in Azerbaijan. In the documentary film shown on Italian television, Volonte also confirmed the receipt of €2.39 million, arguing that this money was transferred from a member of the Azerbaijani delegation to PACE Elkhan Suleymanov for consultations on agriculture. Payments to Volonte went through four British companies, which, according to “The Guardian”, did not conduct any operations in Britain and probably are front companies.\n\nThe Milan prosecutor's office accused Volonte of two episodes: money laundering and accepting bribes. The court of Milan, having considered the second charge, recognized Volonte's immunity for this episode, as according to the Italian constitution, a deputy cannot be prosecuted for his professional activities. Later, the Supreme Court of Italy reversed this decision and returned the case to the Milan Court, citing the fact that the article of the Constitution is not about using his or her position for personal enrichment purposes.\n\nEx-ambassador of Azerbaijan to the European Union Arif Mammadov told “The Guardian” that he spent about 30 million euros for the services of lobbyists as representative of the Azerbaijani delegation to the Council of Europe: “All members of the Azerbaijani delegation knew about this figure, although it never appeared anywhere. It was said, that the money is intended for bribing members of other delegations and the PACE as a whole.” A number of PACE deputies said that they knew about proposals to bribe the European deputies.\n\nElkhan Suleymanov, the representative of Azerbaijan in PACE, is called the “curator” of Volonte and other European deputies. The European press cites examples of how Volonte recalled his requests to the PACE, informing Suleymanov that “your every word is an order for me”. Through the company, from which Volonte received his payments, in total of about one billion euros were conducted. Attempts by Armenian MEPs to raise the issue of corruption in PACE came up against the opposition of PACE President Pedro Agramunt, another subject of investigation of the “caviar diplomacy”, who deprived them of their voice and prevented the investigation. Der Tagesspiegel qualifies this investigation as “the biggest scandal in the history of Europe”. After the publication in the media, Thorbjorn Jagland, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, called on Agramut to personally provide an independent external investigative body without any further delay. Agramunt and the leaders of the five political groups rejected the proposals of the CoE official Wojciech Sawicki, which sets out the conditions for an independent investigation. However, after the visit of Agramunt to Syria, the PACE Bureau expressed to him a vote of no confidence and in fact removed Agramunt from real power, after which in April 2017 the Parliamentary Assembly formed a commission to investigate alleged corruption accusations. Its report has been published in April 2018.\n\nIn April 2017, the Maltese press published documents according to which the top politicians of Malta and the wife of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat received millions of dollars from a bank controlled by Ilham Aliyev's daughter Leila. According to the editorial investigation, Joseph Muscat made a trip to Baku in 2015, after which he called on Europe to give an objective assessment of the positive processes in Azerbaijan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5595933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5595933", "title": "Compitalia", "text": "Compitalia\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, the Compitalia (Latin: Ludi Compitalicii) was a festival celebrated once a year in honor of the Lares Compitales, household deities of the crossroads, to whom sacrifices were offered at the places where two or more ways meet. The word comes from the Latin \"compitum\", a cross-way.\n\nThis festival is more ancient than the building of Rome. It is said by some writers to have been instituted by Tarquinius Priscus in consequence of the miracle attending the birth of Servius Tullius, who was supposed to be the son of a Lar Familiaris, or family guardian deity.\n\nDionysius says that Servius Tullius founded the festival, which he describes as it was celebrated in his time. Dionysius relates that the sacrifices consisted of honey-cakes (\"\") presented by the inhabitants of each house; and that the people who assisted as ministering servants at the festival were not free men, but slaves, because the Lares took pleasure in the service of slaves. He further adds that the Compitalia were celebrated a few days after the Saturnalia with great splendor, and that the slaves on this occasion had full liberty to do as they pleased.\n\nDuring the celebration of the festival, each family placed the statue of the underworld goddess Mania at the door of their house. They also hung up at their doors figures of wool representing men and women, accompanying them with humble requests that the Lares and Mania would be contented with those figures, and spare the people of the house. Slaves offered balls or fleeces of wool instead of human figures.\n\nMacrobius says that the celebration of the Compitalia was restored by the Etruscan king Tarquinius Superbus in response to an oracle that \"they should sacrifice heads (\"capita\") for heads.\" The oracle was taken to mean that in order to maintain the health and prosperity of each family, children should be sacrificed to Mania, identified in this case as the mother of the Lares. But Brutus, after overthrowing the line of Tarquin kings, instead satisfied the oracle by exploiting a verbal loophole, substituting \"heads\" of garlic and poppies.\nThe people who presided over the festival were \"magistri vici\" (\"neighborhood officers\") and on that occasion were allowed to wear the \"toga praetexta\". Public games were added to the festival during the Republican period, but they were suppressed by command of the senate in 68 BCE. Calpurnius Piso was charged by Cicero with violating the decree by allowing the games to be celebrated during his consulship in 58. The festival itself still continued to be observed, even if the games were abolished.\n\nDuring the civil wars of the 40s, the festival fell into disuse, and was accordingly restored during the program of religious reforms carried out by Augustus. As Augustus was now the \"pater patriae\", the worship of the old Lares was discontinued, and the Lares of the emperor consequently became the Lares of the state. Augustus set up Lares or penates at places where two or more ways met and instituted an order of priests to attend to their worship. These priests were chosen from the \"libertini\", people who had been legally freed from slavery, and were called Augustales.\n\nThe Compitalia belonged to the \"feriae conceptivae\", that is, festivals which were celebrated on days appointed annually by the magistrates or priests. The exact day on which this festival was celebrated appears to have varied, though it was always in the winter, at least in the time of Varro, as observed by Isaac Casaubon. Dionysius again relates that it was celebrated a few days after the Saturnalia, and Cicero that it fell on the Kalends of January; but in one of his letters to Atticus, he speaks of it as occurring on the fourth before the Nones of January, that is, January 2. The exact words with which the festival was announced are preserved by Macrobius and Aulus Gellius:\n\nSuetonius writes that Augustus ordered the Lares Compitales crowned twice yearly with spring and summer flowers (\"Compitales Lares ornari bis anno instituit vernis floribus et aestivis\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6943279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6943279", "title": "Economic impact of immigration to Canada", "text": "Economic impact of immigration to Canada\n\nThe economic impact of immigration is an important topic in Canada. While the immigration rate has dropped sharply from its peak early in the 20th century, Canada is still among the countries in the world that accept most immigrants per capita.\n\nThe per capital immigration rate to Canada has been relatively constant since the 1950s, and recent years have seen a steady increase in the education and skill level of immigrants to Canada. However, over the last 25 years the economic position of newcomers to Canada relative to the native population has steadily declined. A 2007 Statistics Canada study shows that the income profile of recent immigrant families deteriorated by a significant amount from 2000 to 2004. Recent immigrants themselves are far more likely than native born Canadians to initially have low incomes, with income and employment rates increasing towards the national average with more time spent in Canada. \n\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, (2017), Canada has one of the highest migration rates in the world. Canada is also unusual among western nations in the widespread popular support for high rates of immigration, and in recent years support for immigration has increased in Canada. All of Canada's major political parties support either sustaining or increasing the current level of immigration.\n\nThere is no agreed view on the net impact of immigration in current times. Historically, Canada's unusually high immigration rates can be traced to the nation's unique economy. One factor is that Canada has one of the world's largest supplies of natural resources such as oil, metals, and lumber. It also has a sparse population spread over a vast landscape. Canada has thus faced acute labour shortages and has responded by actively searching for immigrants. In the late 19th century this included bringing Chinese migrants to build the Canadian Pacific Railway and actively advertising in Europe to find farmers with the Last Best West campaign. Today similar recruitment efforts are needed to staff the oil sands projects in Alberta.\n\nAnother factor that contributes to the immigration question is Canada's low birth rate (10.3 births per 1000 people). The theory is that new residents can assist in meeting future government obligations relating to pay-as-you-go liabilities.\n\nThe economic dangers of population decline are not universally accepted. Organizations like the Fraser Institute question whether a declining population would reduce or increase per capita income, noting that in the short term, with a stable economy, fewer people would increase the per capita income simply because you divide the income among fewer people. The study's authors conducted a series of studies using large amounts of census data (844,476 individuals) and conclude that immigrants who arrived from 1987–2004 paid only 57% of the taxes paid by average Canadian in 2006, with the effect that taxes from immigrants do not exceed the government expenses relating to them (a gap of $23 billion annually according to their numbers). A study by the C. D. Howe Institute suggests that immigration cannot keep Canada's population young and could possibly contribute to population ageing in the near term. Employment statistics also bring into question whether skilled worker immigrants, with a 34% unemployment rate, are successfully meeting existing labour market needs in Canada. Many developed nations have much lower fertility rates than Canada but have not embraced immigration.\n\nThe first detailed analysis of Canadian immigration policy came from the Economic Council of Canada; it called for immigration to be increased to eventually bring Canada's population to 100 million. While it found that the economic benefits to Canada of immigration were fairly small, noting that \"a historical perspective gives little or no support to the view that immigration is needed for national prosperity\", it also concluded that the benefits to the newcomers themselves were extremely large. The report concluded that \"it would be hard not to recommend an increase when immigrants can gain so much and Canadians not only do not lose but actually make slight economic gains\".\n\nThe Canadian system puts great emphasis on finding skilled immigrants. Immigrants to Canada are more skilled than immigrants to the United States. George J. Borjas compared immigrants to Canada and the United States finding those to Canada being better educated and receiving higher wages once settled. He accredits this to Canada's points based immigration system, and argues for the United States to more closely emulate the Canadian method.\n\nWithin the Canadian economy, immigrants are mostly found at the highest education levels. In Canada, 38% of male workers with a post-graduate degree are immigrants to the country. 23% of Canadians are foreign born, but 49% of doctorate holders and 40% of those with a master's degree were born outside Canada. A persistent problem for skilled immigrants is the recognition of foreign credentials. Data from Statistics Canada reports that only 72.2% of new immigrants (landed within 5 years) between the ages of 25 and 54 that possess a university degree are employed. While Canada recruits people to come based on their degrees, many newcomers arrive to find employers and professional organizations not recognizing their foreign education. As the percentage of skilled newcomers as a share of total migrants has increased, so has this problem. A study done by the IZA Journal of Migration, found that between 1991 and 2006, Canadian-educated immigrants and Foreign-educated immigrants, found that Canadian-educated immigrants who graduated from university had a large earnings gap with their Canadian-born counterparts both in the initial years after immigration and in the long run. It was speculated that this outcome was likely due to lack of Canadian work experience and deficiencies in their social networks and language abilities.\n\nThe setting of standards for, or recognition of, almost all professional credentials does not fall within the federal government's control and are therefore not determined by either federal laws or Citizenship and Immigration Canada policies, but Citizenship and Immigration Canada established the Foreign Credentials Referral Office to provide something like a directory assistance service for immigrants. The Government of Ontario enacted the \"Fair Access to Regulated Professions Act, 2006\" to help immigrants qualify for 34 provincially regulated professions. The Act also established the position of Fairness Commissioner (Ontario). In 2007, the Government of Alberta signed an agreement with federal government that will accelerate the process of foreign credential recognition for new immigrants by licensing bodies in that province. Other provinces have made similar commitments.\n\nIn terms of the impact of immigration to economy-wide wage levels, Statistics Canada estimates that for every 10% increase in the population from immigration, wages in Canada are now reduced by 4% on average (with the greatest impact to more skilled workers, such as workers with post-graduate degrees whose wages are reduced by 7%).\n\nIn part because of the credential issue, many immigrants are forced to find work below their education level and at lower wages. However, even for doing work of the same skill level, immigrants are much less well compensated than their native born counterparts. Immigration scholar Jeffrey Reitz calculated that in 2001 native Canadian employers were benefiting from, and immigrant employees were losing out on, between $2 and 3 billion per year due to this imbalance. A study published by Statistics Canada reviewed data from 1991 to 2010 regarding the convergence of wages between immigrants and native-born Canadians. The study found that there was a convergence of relative earnings for immigrants. Immigrant men's average annual wages were 86% of those of native-born men in 2010, up from 76% in 1991.\n\nThere are a number of possible explanations for why newcomers earn less than native Canadians in the same jobs with the same skills. Lower hourly wages might be an indication that the labour productivity of immigrants is lower, and employers thus have reason to pay them less. New workers are also less familiar with the Canadian labour market and will thus not be able to maximize their salaries. Employers will also be less familiar with an immigrant's background and thus less willing to offer the same salary as to a native. Immigrants, especially visible minorities have different values than native-born Canadians as they tend to favour living in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver as opposed to other places much more than native-born Canadians. Due to lower mobility, they do not access better paying jobs, such as in Alberta and Saskatchewan. This has been changing with Calgary already surpassing Montreal in terms of percentage of visible minorities. Visible minorities in Saskatchewan earn higher wages than native-born Canadians.\n\nUnemployment tends to be very high for recent immigrants, compared to more established immigrants (lived in Canada between 5 to 10 years). Established immigrants tend to have an unemployment rate closer to the national unemployment rate of native-born citizens. In 2011, the unemployment rate of recently arrived immigrants was 13.6%, considerably above the native Canadian average of 5.5%. For more established immigrants, the rate fell to 8.2%\n\nHigher rates of unemployment and lower wages combine to give newcomers less income than the Canadian average. An analysis of Longitudinal Immigration Database by Statistics Canada showed that immigrants who landed in 2014, had a median income of $24,000 in 2015, compared to an income of $36,000 for native-born Canadians. The median income for new immigrants in 2015 was the highest ever recorded and $2,000 more than the median income of new immigrants in 2013. In previous decades, immigrant income levels did rise to the national average after 10 years, but in recent years the situation has deteriorated. A 2003 study published by Statistics Canada noted that \"in 1980 recent immigrants had low-income rates 1.4 times that of Canadian born, by 2000 they were 2.5 times higher, at 35.8%.\" The study noted that the deterioration was widespread and affected most types of immigrants. The 2003 study explains that the low-income rate among non-immigrants declined in the 1990s, but this was more than offset by the income profile of new immigrants, resulting in a net rise in Canada's total low-income rate. An updated January 2007 study by Statistics Canada, explains that the deterioration continued into the next decade, with the low-income rate of recent immigrants reaching rates of 3.5 times that of Canadian born in 2002 and 2003, before edging back to 3.2 times in 2004. The 2007 study explains that this deterioration has occurred even though Canada implemented changes in 1993 to encourage more highly educated immigrants, with 45% of new immigrants having university degrees as of 2004.\n\nIn 1991 the Economic Council of Canada found that periods of immigration were not directly linked to periods of high growth. They noted that \"a historical perspective gives little or no support to the view that immigration is needed for economic prosperity. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the fastest growth in per capita real incomes occurred at times when net immigration was nil or negative. Later in the 20th century, the opposite linkage is seen but, clearly, there is no long-term correlation.\" However, the same report found that a high rate of immigration was good for Canada's future, and recommended expanding immigration rates to bring Canada's population to 100 million. A University of Montreal study published in 2002 by professor Marc Termote used different methods and studied different countries and concluded that immigration has no statistically significant impact to the per capita income of a country.\n\nOver the last 25 years the economic position of newcomers to Canada relative to the native population has steadily declined. A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain these issues.\n\nA January 2007 study by Statistics Canada analyzed the drop in income of economic immigrants from several perspectives. Economic immigrants are now more likely to begin their stay in Canada with a \"low-income\" (less than 50% of the median income) than an immigrant in any of the other immigration classes (see Table 16 in the study). This drop occurred during the 1990s and early 2000s despite the percentage of immigrants arriving with degrees in the economic class (including principal applicants, spouses, and dependents) rising from 29% in 1992 to 56% in 2003.\n\nStating an intention to reduce a backlog of immigration applicants of all classes, and to better target the required skills needed in Canada, the federal government passed a law in 2008 that gave the immigration minister new powers to alter immigrant selection. Many expected that these powers would be used to favour workers in skilled trades over immigrants selected on the basis of education through the points system.\n\nWhile the well being of immigrants has declined in recent years, this has not affected second generation immigrants, or those who came to Canada as a child. This group is one of the most successful in Canada, with education and earning levels well above that of their parents and also above the Canadian average.\n\nOne of the most important studies of the economic impact of immigration to Canada is Morton Beiser's \"Strangers at the Gate.\" This study looked at the arrival of the Vietnamese boat people who began to arrive in Canada in 1979 to much controversy. The total number of refugees was 60,000, the largest single group of refugees to ever arrive in Canada. Beiser first studied the boat people upon their arrival, finding that few spoke English or French, that most were farmers with few skills useful in Canada, and that they had arrived with no assets with which to establish themselves. Beiser then followed the progress of the boat people to see what effect they would have on Canada. Within ten years of arrival the boat people had an unemployment rate 2.3% lower than the Canadian average. One in five had started a business, 99% had successfully applied to become Canadian citizens, and they were considerably less likely than average to receive some form of social assistance.\n\nThe government has a large department and a number of programs to try to ensure the well being of immigrants to Canada, and ameliorate their economic condition.\nThe Citizenship and Immigration Canada department employs 5,000 staff, which on a per capita basis is 3 times more than the 15,000 U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services employees. Citizenship and Immigration Canada recoups some of its department costs through landing fees. In 2006, the Canadian government reduced the landing fee per immigrant by 50%. The Parliamentary Budget Officer has reported that irregular migration, from the initial entry into Canada to the final decision from the Immigration and Refugee Board and/or Federal Court, as well as any deportations, cost the federal government $340 million in 2017-18, and is projected to rise to $396 million in 2019-20.\n\nNew immigrants are also entitled to settlement assistance such as free language training under provincial government administered programs usually called Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada (LINC), for which the federal government budgeted about $350 million to give to the provinces for the fiscal year 2006–2007. The majority of the $350 million was allocated to Quebec under the Canada-Quebec Accord, at $196 million per year, even though immigration to Quebec represented only 16.5% of all immigration to Canada in 2005. The $350 million is budgeted to increase by an additional $90 million by 2009. Provincial governments in Canada have established citizenship and immigration departments, such as the Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration (Ontario).\n\nSupport for immigrants was also one of the key issues that formed the basis of the New Deal for Cities between Toronto (and other urban centres), the Government of Ontario, and the Government of Canada, because 43% of new immigrants settle in the Greater Toronto Area resulting in certain challenges for that region. A paper published by Statistics Canada noted that \"Over the 1990s (1990 to 2000) the city's low-income rate rose 1.9 percentage points. All of this increase was associated with deteriorating outcomes among immigrants, which tended to increase the city's low-income rate by 2.8 percentage points.\" In other words, the low-income rate among non-immigrants fell, but the income profile of new immigrants resulted in a net widening of the income inequality gap in Toronto during the 1990s.\n\nThe needs of immigrants prompted the United Way of Greater Toronto, the largest United Way charity in Canada, to identify immigration services in Toronto as a top priority for their $100 million 2006 campaign to combat poverty and social exclusion. In 2006, the \"Daily Bread Food Bank\" in Toronto reported that over 40% of its clients are foreign-born, and that almost half of that group had been in the country for less than 4 years. While the less than 4 year group shows far above average need, the over 40% figure is in line with the general population as 44% of Torontonians are foreign-born.\n\nThere is no consensus on the net impact of immigration to government finances. A 1990 study found that an average immigrant household paid $22,528 in all forms of taxes and on average each household directly consumed $10,558 in government services. By contrast an average native Canadian household paid $20,259 in tax and consumed $10,102 dollars in services. Across the country this means that immigrant households contributed $2.6 billion more than their share to the public purse. A 1996 study found that over a lifetime a typical immigrant family will pay some forty thousand dollars more to the treasury than they will consume in services. Explanations for this include that immigrant households tend to be larger, and have more wage earners, increasing taxes. Newcomers are also less likely to make use of many social services. Immigrants are less likely than native Canadians to receive employment insurance, social assistance, and subsidized housing. Immigrants are also much less likely to become homeless or suffer from mental illness. Recent immigrants are also less likely to make use of subsidized housing than native Canadians of the same income level. In 2004 22.5% of low-income native Canadians lived in subsidized housing, but only 20.4% of low income recent immigrants did so, though this number was considerably higher among more established immigrants. Results from a study from the Fraser Institute found that the immigrants who arrived between 1987 and 2004 cost governments $23 billion per annum (as of 2006) in excess of taxes raised from those immigrants, relating to universal social services (e.g., welfare, medicare, public education).\n\nThe presence within Canada of people representative of many different cultures and nations has also been an important boost to Canada's international trade. Immigrants will often have expertise, linguistic skills, personal connections with their country of origin that can help forge international trade ties. Studies have found that Canada does have greater trade relations with those nations that have provided large numbers of immigrants. Canada's economy is heavily centered on international trade, which accounted for 31.4% of GDP in 2017. 76.4% of Canadian exports go to the United States.\n\nThis has been good for the source countries of immigrants to Canada. For many years, expanded markets for trade has been a common rationale and justification for high immigration from the developing world. Data from Statistics Canada in 2017 reveals that the trade balances with developing countries from which Canada receives most of its immigrants ameliorates. Current data, 2017, shows that only India has balanced trade with Canada:\n\n[India]: Canada imports $4.158 billion, and exports $4.204 billion\n\n[Pakistan]: Canada imports $401.826 million, and exports $733.060 million\n\n[Philippines]: Canada imports $1.392 billion, and exports $811.073 million\n\n[China]: Canada imports $70.926 billion, and exports $21.845 billion\n\n[Iran]: Canada imports $88.482 million, and exports $125.955 million\n\n[Syria]: Canada imports $1.179 million, and exports $22.520 million\n\n\n"}

A \"fayre\" in every sense of the word, it featured a host of different types of performances, media, experimental theatre and rock, punk, folk and reggae music. The first Fayre was tiny, attracting only 1500 or so, but the attendance increased over the years as the organisers booked better known acts, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure, and The Fall. The organisers decided to close down the festival after 1986 because of hard drug use and vandalism.\n\nIn 1980 a small festival which had outgrown its site at Polgooth in mid-Cornwall approached the Port Eliot estate and asked if it could be held in the idyllic grounds. The estate office agreed a price, and there began the Elephant Fayre, one of the most eclectic festivals of the 1980s, which was named after the elephant in the Eliot family’s crest. A prime attraction of the event was a giant wooden elephant which could be mounted via an internal ladder. \n\nThe festival ran from 1981–1986, beginning with some 1,500 visitors over four days, and featured a mix of music, theatre and visual arts. Over the years the festival grew, attracting crowds of up to 30,000 and bands such as The Cure, The Fall and Siouxsie and the Banshees. By 1986 the festival, like so many of the time, had become victim of its own success. The tolerance of the free festival culture of the 70s was over, as New Age Travellers became a focus for disorder across the country. Despite the tolerance of the then Lord Eliot and fellow festival benefactor Michael Eavis at Glastonbury (known affectionately in festival crew parlance as 'The Good Lord and The Worthy Farmer') the travellers put paid, it was said, to the Elephant Fayre and seriously compromised Glastonbury.\n\nWhilst the festival at Port Eliot had built up a reputation as one of the best in the country, with extraordinary acts and the liberal attitude of the organisers, it was alleged the travellers had taken advantage and destroyed the festival. The burning down of the oldest tree in the park, looting of the village surgery and the robbing of stall-holders prompted Lord Eliot and fellow organisers to make the 1986 festival the last.\n\nThe Elephant Fayre has reinvented itself and is now the Port Eliot Festival. It describes itself as having \"All the brains of a literary festival. All the soul of a music festival.\" It is held mid summer.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "62312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62312", "title": "Forgery", "text": "Forgery\n\nForgery is a white-collar crime that generally refers to the false making or material alteration of a legal instrument with the specific intent to defraud anyone (other than himself or herself). Copies, studio replicas, and reproductions are not considered forgeries, though they may later become forgeries through knowing and willful misrepresentations. Forging money or currency is more often called counterfeiting. But consumer goods may also be \"counterfeits\" if they are not manufactured or produced by the designated manufacturer or producer given on the label or flagged by the trademark symbol. When the object forged is a record or document it is often called a false document.\n\nThis usage of \"forgery\" does not derive from metalwork done at a forge, but it has a parallel history. A sense of \"to counterfeit\" is already in the Anglo-French verb \"forger\", meaning \"falsify\".\n\nA forgery is essentially concerned with a produced or altered object. Where the prime concern of a forgery is less focused on the object itself – what it is worth or what it \"proves\" – than on a tacit statement of criticism that is revealed by the reactions the object provokes in others, then the larger process is a hoax. In a hoax, a rumor or a genuine object planted in a concocted situation, may substitute for a forged physical object.\n\nThe similar crime of fraud is the crime of deceiving another, including through the use of objects obtained through forgery. Forgery is one of the techniques of fraud, including identity theft. Forgery is one of the threats addressed by security engineering.\n\nIn the 16th century, imitators of Albrecht Dürer's style of printmaking improved the market for their own prints by signing them \"AD\", making them forgeries. In the 20th century the art market made forgeries highly profitable. There are widespread forgeries of especially valued artists, such as drawings originally by Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, and Henri Matisse.\n\nA special case of double forgery is the forging of Vermeer's paintings by Han van Meegeren, and in its turn the forging of Van Meegeren's work by his son Jacques van Meegeren.\n\nIn England and Wales and Northern Ireland, forgery is an offence under section 1 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, which provides:\n\n\"Instrument\" is defined by section 8, \"makes\" and \"false\" by section 9, and \"induce\" and \"prejudice\" by section 10.\n\nForgery is triable either way. A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.\n\nFor offences akin to forgery, see English criminal law#Forgery, personation, and cheating.\n\nThe common law offence of forgery is abolished for all purposes not relating to offences committed before the commencement of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.\n\nForgery is not an official offence under the law of Scotland, except in cases where statute provides otherwise.\n\nThe Forgery of Foreign Bills Act 1803 was repealed in 2013.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, forgery is an offence under section 25(1) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 which provides:\n\nA person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or to a fine, or to both.\n\nAny offence at common law of forgery is abolished. The abolition of a common law offence of forgery does not affect proceedings for any such offence committed before its abolition.\n\nExcept as regards offences committed before the commencement of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 and except where the context otherwise requires, without prejudice to section 65(4)(a) of that Act, references to forgery must be construed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.\n\nForgery is an offence under sections 366, 367 and 368 of the Canadian Criminal Code. The offence is a hybrid offence, subject to a maximum prison sentence of:\n\nForgery is a crime in all jurisdictions within the United States, both state and federal. Most states, including California, describe forgery as occurring when a person alters a written document \"with the intent to defraud, knowing that he or she has no authority to do so.\" The written document usually has to be an instrument of legal significance. Punishments for forgery vary widely. In California, forgery for an amount under $950 can result in misdemeanor charges and no jail time, while a forgery involving a loss of over $500,000 can result in three years in prison for the forgery plus a five-year \"conduct enhancement\" for the amount of the loss, yielding eight years in prison. In Connecticut, forgery in the Third Degree, which is a class B misdemeanor is punishable by up to 6 months in jail, a $1000 fine, and probation; forgery in the First Degree, which is a class C felony, is punishable by a maximum 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 fine, or both.\n\nAs to the effect, in the United Kingdom, of a forged signature on a bill of exchange, see section 24 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882.\n\nBefore the invention of photography, people commonly hired painters and engravers to \"re-create\" an event or a scene. Artists had to imagine what to illustrate based on the information available to them about the subject. Some artists added elements to make the scene more exotic, while others removed elements out of modesty. In the 18th century, for example, Europeans were curious about what North America looked like and were ready to pay to see illustrations depicting this faraway place. Some of these artists produced prints depicting North America, despite many having never left Europe.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "10438439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10438439", "title": "Framing (social sciences)", "text": "Framing (social sciences)\n\nIn the social sciences, framing comprises a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives on how individuals, groups, and societies, organize, perceive, and communicate about reality. Framing involves social construction of a social phenomenon – by mass media sources, political or social movements, political leaders, or other actors and organizations. Participation in a language community necessarily influences an individual's \"perception\" of the meanings attributed to words or phrases. Politically, the language communities of advertising, religion, and mass media are highly contested, whereas framing in less-sharply defended language communities might evolve imperceptibly and organically over cultural time frames, with fewer overt modes of disputation.\n\nFraming can manifest in thought or interpersonal communication. \"Frames in thought\" consist of the mental representations, interpretations, and simplifications of reality. \"Frames in communication\" consist of the communication of frames between different actors.\n\nOne can view framing in communication as positive or negative – depending on the audience and what kind of information is being presented. The framing may be in the form of \"equivalence frames\", where two or more logically equivalent alternatives are portrayed in different ways (see framing effect) or \"emphasis frames\", which simplify reality by focusing on a subset of relevant aspects of a situation or issue. In the case of \"equivalence frames\", the information being presented is based on the same facts, but the \"frame\" in which it is presented changes, thus creating a reference-dependent perception.\n\nThe effects of framing can be seen in many journalism applications. With the same information being used as a base, the \"frame\" surrounding the issue can change the reader's perception without having to alter the actual facts. In the context of politics or mass-media communication, a frame defines the packaging of an element of rhetoric in such a way as to encourage certain interpretations and to discourage others. For political purposes, framing often presents facts in such a way that implicates a problem that is in need of a solution. Members of political parties attempt to frame issues in a way that makes a solution favoring their own political leaning appear as the most appropriate course of action for the situation at hand.\n\nIn social theory, framing is a schema of interpretation, a collection of anecdotes and stereotypes, that individuals rely on to understand and respond to events. In other words, people build a series of mental \"filters\" through biological and cultural influences. They then use these filters to make sense of the world. The choices they then make are influenced by their creation of a frame.\n\nFraming is also a key component of sociology, the study of social interaction among humans. Framing is an integral part of conveying and processing data on a daily basis. Successful framing techniques can be used to reduce the ambiguity of intangible topics by contextualizing the information in such a way that recipients can connect to what they already know.\n\nWhen one seeks to explain an event, the understanding often depends on the frame referred to. If a friend rapidly closes and opens an eye, we will respond very differently depending on whether we attribute this to a purely \"physical\" frame (they blinked) or to a social frame (they winked). Though the former might result from a speck of dust (resulting in an involuntary and not particularly meaningful reaction), the latter would imply a voluntary and meaningful action (to convey humor to an accomplice, for example). \n\nObservers will read events seen as purely physical or within a frame of \"nature\" differently from those seen as occurring with social frames. But we do not look at an event and then \"apply\" a frame to it. Rather, individuals constantly project into the world around them the interpretive frames that allow them to make sense of it; we only shift frames (or realize that we have habitually applied a frame) when incongruity calls for a frame-shift. In other words, we only become aware of the frames that we always already use when something forces us to replace one frame with another.\n\nFraming is so effective because it is an heuristic, or mental shortcut that may not always yield desired results; and is seen as a 'rule of thumb'. According to Susan T. Fiske and Shelley E. Taylor, human beings are by nature \"cognitive misers\", meaning they prefer to do as little thinking as possible. Frames provide people a quick and easy way to process information. Hence, people will use the previously mentioned mental filters (a series of which is called a schema) to make sense of incoming messages. This gives the sender and framer of the information enormous power to use these schemas to influence how the receivers will interpret the message.\n\nThough some consider framing to be synonymous with agenda setting, other scholars state that there is a distinction. According to an article written by Donald H. Weaver, framing selects certain aspects of an issue and makes them more prominent in order to elicit certain interpretations and evaluations of the issue, whereas agenda setting introduces the issue topic to increase its salience and accessibility.\n\nIn the field of communication, framing defines how news media coverage shapes mass opinion. Richard E. Vatz's discourse on creation of rhetorical meaning relates directly to framing, although he references it little. To be specific, framing effects refer to behavioral or attitudinal strategies and/or outcomes that are due to how a given piece of information is being framed in public discourse. Today, many volumes of the major communication journals contain papers on media frames and framing effects. Approaches used in such papers can be broadly classified into two groups: studies of framing as the dependent variable and studies of framing as the independent variable. The former usually deals with \"frame building\" (i.e. how frames create societal discourse about an issue and how different frames are adopted by journalists) and latter concerns \"frame setting\" (i.e. how media framing influences an audience).\n\nFrame building is related to at least three areas: journalist norms, political actors, and cultural situations. It assumes that several media frames compete to set one frame regarding an issue, and one frame finally gains influence because it resonates with popular culture, fits with media practices, or is heavily sponsored by elites.\nFirst, in terms of practices of news production, there are at least five aspects of news work that may influence how journalists frame a certain issue: larger societal norms and values, organizational pressures and constraints, external pressures from interest groups and other policy makers, professional routines, and ideological or political orientations of journalists. The second potential influence on frame building comes from elites, including interest groups, government bureaucracies, and other political or corporate actors. Empirical studies show that these influences of elites seem to be strongest for issues in which journalists and various players in the policy arena can find shared narratives. Finally, cultural contexts of a society are also able to establish frame. Erving Goffman assumes that the meaning of a frame has implicit cultural roots. This context dependency of media frame has been described as 'cultural resonance' or 'narrative fidelity'.\n\nWhen people are exposed to a novel news frame, they will accept the constructs made applicable to an issue, but they are significantly more likely to do so when they have existing schema for those constructs. This is called the applicability effect. That is, when new frames invite people to apply their existing schema to an issue, the implication of that application depends, in part, on what is in that schema. Therefore, generally, the more the audiences know about issues, the more effective are frames.\n\nThere are a number of levels and types of framing effects that have been examined. For example, scholars have focused on attitudinal and behavioral changes, the degrees of perceived importance of the issue, voting decisions, and opinion formations. Others are interested in psychological processes other than applicability. For instance, Iyengar suggested that news about social problems can influence attributions of causal and treatment responsibility, an effect observed in both cognitive responses and evaluations of political leaders, or other scholars looked at the framing effects on receivers' evaluative processing style and the complexity of audience members' thoughts about issues.\n\nNews media frame all news items by emphasizing specific values, facts, and other considerations, and endowing them with greater apparent applicability for making related judgments. News media promotes particular definitions, interpretations, evaluations and recommendations.\n\nAnthropologist Gregory Bateson first articulated the concept of framing in his 1972 book \"Steps to an Ecology of Mind\". A frame, Bateson wrote, is \"a spatial and temporal bounding of a set of interactive messages.\"\n\nMedia framing research has both sociological and psychological roots. Sociological framing focuses on \"the words, images, phrases, and presentation styles\" that communicators use when relaying information to recipients. Research on frames in sociologically driven media research generally examines the influence of \"social norms and values, organizational pressures and constraints, pressures of interest groups, journalistic routines, and ideological or political orientations of journalists\" on the existence of frames in media content.\n\nTodd Gitlin, in his analysis of how the news media trivialized the student New Left movement during the 1960s, was among the first to examine media frames from a sociological perspective. Frames, Gitlin wrote, are \"persistent patterns of cognition, interpretations, and presentation, of selection [and] emphasis ... [that are] largely unspoken and unacknowledged ... [and] organize the world for both journalists [and] for those of us who read their reports.\"\n\nResearch on frames in psychologically driven media research generally examines the effects of media frames on those who receive them. For example, Iyengar explored the impact of episodic and thematic news frames on viewers' attributions of responsibility for political issues including crime, terrorism, poverty, unemployment, and racial inequality. According to Iyengar, an episodic news frame \"takes the form of a case study or event-oriented report and depicts public issues in terms of concrete instances,\" while a thematic news frame \"places public issues in some more general abstract context ... directed at general outcomes or conditions.\" Iyengar found that the majority of television news coverage of poverty, for example, was episodic. In fact, in a content analysis of six years of television news, Iyengar found that the typical news viewer would have been twice as likely to encounter episodic rather than thematic television news about poverty. Further, experimental results indicate participants who watched episodic news coverage of poverty were more than twice as likely as those who watched thematic news coverage of poverty to attribute responsibility of poverty to the poor themselves rather than society. Given the predominance of episodic framing of poverty, Iyengar argues that television news shifts responsibility of poverty from government and society to the poor themselves. After examining content analysis and experimental data on poverty and other political issues, Iyengar concludes that episodic news frames divert citizens' attributions of political responsibility away from society and political elites, making them less likely to support government efforts to address those issue and obscuring the connections between those issues and their elected officials' actions or lack thereof.\n\nPerhaps because of their use across the social sciences, frames have been defined and used in many disparate ways. Entman called framing \"a scattered conceptualization\" and \"a fractured paradigm\" that \"is often defined casually, with much left to an assumed tacit understanding of the reader.\" In an effort to provide more conceptual clarity, Entman suggested that frames \"select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described.\"\n\nEntman's conceptualization of framing, which suggests frames work by elevating particular pieces of information in salience, is in line with much early research on the psychological underpinnings of framing effects (see also Iyengar, who argues that accessibility is the primary psychological explanation for the existence of framing effects). Wyer and Srull explain the construct of accessibility thus:\n\nThe argument supporting accessibility as the psychological process underlying framing can therefore be summarized thus: Because people rely heavily on news media for public affairs information, the most accessible information about public affairs often comes from the public affairs news they consume. The argument supporting accessibility as the psychological process underlying framing has also been cited as support in the debate over whether framing should be subsumed by agenda-setting theory as part of the second level of agenda setting. McCombs and other agenda-setting scholars generally agree that framing should be incorporated, along with priming, under the umbrella of agenda setting as a complex model of media effects linking media production, content, and audience effects. Indeed, McCombs, Llamas, Lopez-Escobar, and Rey justified their attempt to combine framing and agenda-setting research on the assumption of parsimony.\n\nScheufele, however, argues that, unlike agenda setting and priming, framing does not rely primarily on accessibility, making it inappropriate to combine framing with agenda setting and priming for the sake of parsimony. Empirical evidence seems to vindicate Scheufele's claim. For example, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley empirically demonstrated that applicability, rather than their salience, is key. By operationalizing accessibility as the response latency of respondent answers where more accessible information results in faster response times, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley demonstrated that accessibility accounted for only a minor proportion of the variance in framing effects while applicability accounted for the major proportion of variance. Therefore, according to Nelson and colleagues, \"frames influence opinions by stressing specific values, facts, and other considerations, endowing them with greater apparent relevance to the issue than they might appear to have under an alternative frame.\"\n\nIn other words, while early research suggested that by highlighting particular aspects of issues, frames make certain considerations more accessible and therefore more likely to be used in the judgment process, more recent research suggests that frames work by making particular considerations more applicable and therefore more relevant to the judgment process.\n\nChong and Druckman suggest framing research has mainly focused on two types of frames: equivalency and emphasis frames. Equivalency frames offer \"different, but logically equivalent phrases,\" which cause individuals to alter their preferences. Equivalency frames are often worded in terms of \"gains\" versus \"losses.\" For example, Kahneman and Tversky asked participants to choose between two \"gain-framed\" policy responses to a hypothetical disease outbreak expected to kill 600 people. Response A would save 200 people while Response B had a one-third probability of saving everyone, but a two-thirds probability of saving no one. Participants overwhelmingly chose Response A, which they perceived as the less risky option. Kahneman and Tversky asked other participants to choose between two equivalent \"loss-framed\" policy responses to the same disease outbreak. In this condition, Response A would kill 400 people while Response B had a one-third probability of killing no one but a two-thirds probability of killing everyone. Although these options are mathematically identical to those given in the \"gain-framed\" condition, participants overwhelmingly chose Response B, the risky option. Kahneman and Tversky, then, demonstrated that when phrased in terms of potential gains, people tend to choose what they perceive as the less risky option (i.e., the sure gain). Conversely, when faced with a potential loss, people tend to choose the riskier option.\n\nUnlike equivalency frames, emphasis frames offer \"qualitatively different yet potentially relevant considerations\" which individuals use to make judgments. For example, Nelson, Clawson, and Oxley exposed participants to a news story that presented the Ku Klux Klan's plan to hold a rally. Participants in one condition read a news story that framed the issue in terms of public safety concerns while participants in the other condition read a news story that framed the issue in terms of free speech considerations. Participants exposed to the public safety condition considered public safety applicable for deciding whether the Klan should be allowed to hold a rally and, as expected, expressed lower tolerance of the Klan's right to hold a rally. Participants exposed to the free speech condition, however, considered free speech applicable for deciding whether the Klan should be allowed to hold a rally and, as expected, expressed greater tolerance of the Klan's right to hold a rally.\n\nAmos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman have shown that framing can affect the outcome (i.e. the choices one makes) of choice problems, to the extent that several of the classic axioms of rational choice do not hold. This led to the development of prospect theory as an alternative to rational choice theory.\n\nThe context or framing of problems adopted by decision-makers results in part from extrinsic manipulation of the decision-options offered, as well as from forces intrinsic to decision-makers, e.g., their norms, habits, and unique temperament.\n\nTversky and Kahneman (1981) demonstrated systematic reversals of preference when the same problem is presented in different ways, for example in the Asian disease problem. Participants were asked to \"imagine that the U.S. is preparing for the outbreak of an unusual Asian disease, which is expected to kill 600 people. Two alternative programs to combat the disease have been proposed. Assume the exact scientific estimate of the consequences of the programs are as follows.\"\n\nThe first group of participants was presented with a choice between programs:\nIn a group of 600 people,\n\n72 percent of participants preferred program A (the remainder, 28%, opting for program B).\n\nThe second group of participants was presented with the choice between the following:\nIn a group of 600 people,\n\nIn this decision frame, 78% preferred program D, with the remaining 22% opting for program C.\n\nPrograms A and C are identical, as are programs B and D. The change in the decision frame between the two groups of participants produced a preference reversal: when the programs were presented in terms of lives saved, the participants preferred the secure program, A (= C). When the programs were presented in terms of expected deaths, participants chose the gamble D (= B).\n\nFraming effects arise because one can frequently frame a decision using multiple scenarios, wherein one may express benefits either as a relative risk reduction (RRR), or as absolute risk reduction (ARR). Extrinsic control over the cognitive distinctions (between risk tolerance and reward anticipation) adopted by decision makers can occur through altering the presentation of relative risks and absolute benefits.\n\nPeople generally prefer the absolute certainty inherent in a positive framing-effect, which offers an assurance of gains. When decision-options appear framed as a \"likely gain\", risk-averse choices predominate.\n\nA shift toward risk-seeking behavior occurs when a decision-maker frames decisions in negative terms, or adopts a negative framing effect.\n\nIn medical decision making, framing bias is best avoided by using absolute measures of efficacy.\n\nResearchers have found that framing decision-problems in a positive light generally results in less-risky choices; with negative framing of problems, riskier choices tend to result.\n\nIn a study by researchers at Dartmouth Medical School, 57% of the subjects chose a medication when presented with benefits in relative terms, whereas only 14.7% chose a medication whose benefit appeared in absolute terms. Further questioning of the patients suggested that, because the subjects ignored the underlying risk of disease, they perceived benefits as greater when expressed in relative terms.\n\nResearchers have proposed various models explaining the framing effect:\n\nCognitive neuroscientists have linked the framing-effect to neural activity in the amygdala, and have identified another brain-region, the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC), that appears to moderate the role of emotion on decisions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to monitor brain-activity during a financial decision-making task, they observed greater activity in the OMPFC of those research subjects less susceptible to the framing-effect.\n\nFraming theory and frame analysis provide a broad theoretical approach that analysts have used in communication studies, news (Johnson-Cartee, 1995), politics, and social movements (among other applications).\n\nAccording to some sociologists, the \"social construction of collective action frames\" involves \"public discourse, that is, the interface of media discourse and interpersonal interaction; persuasive communication during mobilization campaigns by movement organizations, their opponents and countermovement organizations; and consciousness raising during episodes of collective action.\"\n\nWord-selection or diction has been a component of rhetoric since time immemorial. But most commentators attribute the concept of framing to the work of Erving Goffman on frame analysis and point especially to his 1974 book, \"Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience\". Goffman used the idea of frames to label \"schemata of interpretation\" that allow individuals or groups \"to locate, perceive, identify, and label\" events and occurrences, thus rendering meaning, organizing experiences, and guiding actions.\nGoffman's framing concept evolved out of his 1959 work, \"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life\", a commentary on the management of impressions. These works arguably depend on Kenneth Boulding's concept of image.\n\nSociologists have utilized framing to explain the process of social movements.\nMovements act as carriers of beliefs and ideologies (compare memes). In addition, they operate as part of the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers (Snow & Benford, 1988). Sociologists deem the mobilization of mass-movements \"successful\" when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties. Researchers of framing speak of this process as \"frame re-alignment\".\n\nSnow and Benford (1988) regard frame-alignment as an important element in social mobilization or movement. They argue that when individual frames become linked in congruency and complementariness, \"frame alignment\" occurs,\nproducing \"frame resonance\", a catalyst in the process of a group making the transition from one frame to another (although not all framing efforts prove successful). The conditions that affect or constrain framing efforts include the following:\n\nSnow and Benford (1988) propose that once someone has constructed proper frames as described above, large-scale changes in society such as those necessary for social movement can be achieved through frame-alignment.\n\nFrame-alignment comes in four forms: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension and frame transformation.\n\n\nWhen this happens, the securing of participants and support requires new values, new meanings and understandings. Goffman (1974, pp. 43–44) calls this \"keying\", where \"activities, events, and biographies that are already meaningful from the standpoint of some primary framework, in terms of another framework\" (Snow et al., 1986, p. 474) such that they are seen differently. Two types of frame transformation exist:\n\n\nAlthough the idea of language-framing had been explored earlier by Kenneth Burke (terministic screens), political communication researcher Jim A. Kuypers first published work advancing frame analysis (framing analysis) as a rhetorical perspective in 1997. His approach begins inductively by looking for themes that persist across time in a text (for Kuypers, primarily news narratives on an issue or event) and then determining how those themes are framed. Kuypers's work begins with the assumption that frames are powerful rhetorical entities that \"induce us to filter our perceptions of the world in particular ways, essentially making some aspects of our multi-dimensional reality more noticeable than other aspects. They operate by making some information more salient than other information...\"\n\nIn his 2009 essay \"Framing Analysis\" in \"Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action\" and his 2010 essay \"Framing Analysis as a Rhetorical Process\", Kuypers offers a detailed conception for doing framing analysis from a rhetorical perspective. According to Kuypers, \"Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner. Frames operate in four key ways: they define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies. Frames are often found within a narrative account of an issue or event, and are generally the central organizing idea.\" Kuypers's work is based on the premise that framing is a rhetorical process and as such it is best examined from a rhetorical point of view. Curing the problem is not rhetorical and best left to the observer.\n\nFraming is used to construct, refine, and deliver messages. Framing in politics is essential to getting your message across to the masses. Frames are mental structures that shape the way we view the world (Lakoff, Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate 2004). Reframing is used particularly well by both conservatives and liberals in the political arena, so well that they have news anchors and commentators discussing the ideas, supplied phrases and framing (Lakoff, Don't Think of an Elephant! Know Your Values and Frame the Debate 2004).\n\nPreference reversals and other associated phenomena are of wider relevance within behavioural economics, as they contradict the predictions of rational choice, the basis of traditional economics. Framing biases affecting investing, lending, borrowing decisions make one of the themes of behavioral finance.\n\nEdward Zelinsky has shown that framing effects can explain some observed behaviors of legislators.\n\nThe role framing plays in the effects of media presentation has been widely discussed, with the central notion that associated perceptions of factual information can vary based upon the presentation of the information.\n\nIn \"Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age,\"Jim A. Kuypers examined the differences in framing of the War on Terror between the Bush administration and the U.S. mainstream news media between 2001 and 2005. Kuypers looked for common themes between presidential speeches and press reporting of those speeches, and then determined how the president and the press had framed those themes. By using a rhetorical version of framing analysis, Kuypers determined that the U.S. news media advanced frames counter to those used by the Bush administration:\n\nTable One: Comparison of President and News Media Themes and Frames 8 Weeks after 9/11\n\nIn 1991 Robert M. Entman published findings surrounding the differences in media coverage between Korean Air Lines Flight 007 and Iran Air Flight 655. After evaluating various levels of media coverage, based on both amount of airtime and pages devoted to similar events, Entman concluded that the frames the events were presented in by the media were drastically different:\n\nDifferences in coverage amongst various media outlets:\n\nIn 1988 Irwin Levin and Gary Gaeth did a study on the effects of framing attribute information on consumers before and after consuming a product (1988). In this study they found that in a study on beef, people who ate beef labeled as 75% lean rated it more favorably than people whose beef was labelled 25% fat.\n\nLinguist and rhetoric scholar George Lakoff argues that, in order to persuade a political audience of one side of an argument or another, the facts must be presented through a rhetorical frame. It is argued that, without the frame, the facts of an argument become lost on an audience, making the argument less effective. The rhetoric of politics uses framing to present the facts surrounding an issue in a way that creates the appearance of a problem at hand that requires a solution. Politicians using framing to make their own solution to an exigence appear to be the most appropriate compared to that of the opposition. Counter-arguments become less effective in persuading an audience once one side has framed an argument, because it is argued that the opposition then has the additional burden of arguing the frame of the issue in addition to the issue itself.\n\nFraming a political issue, a political party or a political opponent is a strategic goal in politics, particularly in the United States of America. Both the Democratic and Republican political parties compete to successfully harness its power of persuasion. According to the \"New York Times\":\n\nBecause framing has the ability to alter the public's perception, politicians engage in battles to determine how issues are framed. Hence, the way the issues are framed in the media reflects who is winning the battle. For instance, according to Robert Entman, professor of Communication at George Washington University, in the build-up to the Gulf War the conservatives were successful in making the debate whether to attack sooner or later, with no mention of the possibility of not attacking. Since the media picked up on this and also framed the debate in this fashion, the conservatives won.\n\nOne particular example of Lakoff's work that attained some degree of fame was his advice to rename trial lawyers (unpopular in the United States) as \"public protection attorneys\". Though Americans have not generally adopted this suggestion, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America did rename themselves the \"American Association of Justice\", in what the Chamber of Commerce called an effort to hide their identity.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" depicted similar intensity among Republicans:\n\nFrom a political perspective, framing has widespread consequences. For example, the concept of framing links with that of agenda-setting: by consistently invoking a particular frame, the framing party may effectively control discussion and perception of the issue. Sheldon Rampton and John Stauber in \"Trust Us, We're Experts\" illustrate how public-relations (PR) firms often use language to help frame a given issue, structuring the questions that then subsequently emerge. For example, one firm advises clients to use \"bridging language\" that uses a strategy of answering questions with specific terms or ideas in order to shift the discourse from an uncomfortable topic to a more comfortable one.\nPractitioners of this strategy might attempt to draw attention away from one frame in order to focus on another. As Lakoff notes, \"On the day that George W. Bush took office, the words \"tax relief\" started coming out of the White House.\"\nBy refocusing the structure away from one frame (\"tax burden\" or \"tax responsibilities\"), individuals can set the agenda of the questions asked in the future.\n\nCognitive linguists point to an example of framing in the phrase \"tax relief\". In this frame, use of the concept \"relief\" entails a concept of (without mentioning the benefits resulting from) taxes putting strain on the citizen:\n\nAlternative frames may emphasize the concept of taxes as a source of infrastructural support to businesses:\n\nFrames can limit debate by setting the vocabulary and metaphors through which participants can comprehend and discuss an issue. They form a part not just of political discourse, but of cognition. In addition to generating new frames, politically oriented framing research aims to increase public awareness of the connection between framing and reasoning.\n\n\n\nLevin, Irwin P., and Gary J.

He assumed the throne in 386 after the deaths of Fu Jiān (Emperor Xuanzhao) and Fu Jiān's son Fu Pi (Emperor Aiping), even though he was only a distant relative of theirs, as by that time Former Qin's territory had largely been reduced to the territory under his control. He battled the Later Qin emperor Yao Chang for years in a stalemate that neither could conclusively prevail, but in 394, he made a major attack on Later Qin after Yao Chang's death, seriously underestimating Yao Chang's son and successor Yao Xing, who captured and executed him. Later that year, his son Fu Chong, who succeeded him, would die in battle, ending Former Qin.\n\nFu Deng was born in 343, to Fu Chang (苻敞), a distant grandnephew of Former Qin's founder Fu Jiàn, while still under Later Zhao rule. After Fu Jiàn founded Former Qin in 351, Fu Chang served as a general and a commandery governor. During the reign of Fu Jiàn's cruel and whimsical son Fu Sheng (r. 355–357), Fu Chang was executed, but he was posthumously honored after Fu Sheng was overthrown by his cousin Fu Jiān. Fu Jiān was impressed by Fu Deng's abilities, and when he grew older, Fu Deng was made the county magistrate of the capital Chang'an. Later, however, for unspecified faults, he was demoted to be the county magistrate for Didao (狄道, in modern Dingxi, Gansu).\n\nAfter Former Qin began to collapse in 384 and Fu Jiān was killed by the Later Qin general Yao Chang in 385, Fu Deng became a subordinate of the general Mao Xing (毛興), who sought to control all of the provinces in the west still nominally under Former Qin rule, but his soldiers became weary from all of the battles and assassinated him in 386, replacing him with Wei Ping (衛平), a very old general who was the head of the clan. However, these soldiers soon became convinced that Wei was too old to accomplish much, and they deposed Wei and replaced him with Fu Deng. Fu Deng submitted a report of these events to Fu Jiān's son Fu Pi, the new emperor, and Fu Pi commissioned him as a provincial governor and created him the Prince of Nan'an.\n\nThe battles between Fu Deng and Yao Chang after the former replaced Wei Ping coincided with a time of droughts and famines. Fu Deng called the killed enemies \"shóushí\" (熟食, \"cooked food\" or \"readied food\") and told his soldiers, \"Fight in the morning and you will have meat to eat in the evening. Why worry about hunger?\" The soldiers followed his order, ate the corpses, and had the force for battles. Hearing this, Yao Chang hurried to call his brother Yao Shuode (姚碩德) for help, saying, \"If you do not come, we are going to be eaten off by Fu Deng.\"\n\nLater in 386, Fu Pi died in battle against Jin, and the territory under his direct control (modern Shanxi), as well as his officials, fell into the hands of the Western Yan emperor Murong Yong. His official Kou Qian (寇遣) escorted his sons Fu Yi (苻懿) the Prince of Bohai and Fu Chang (苻昶, note different character than Fu Deng's father) the Prince of Jibei to Fu Deng's domain. Fu Deng, after mourning for Fu Pi, proposed to have Fu Yi declared emperor, but his subordinates all opined that given the state Former Qin was in (down to holding not much more than the territory under Fu Deng's control), the state needed an older emperor; at their suggestion, Fu Deng himself took the throne. He made Fu Yi his crown prince.\n\nEven before he took imperial title, Fu Deng battled Yao Chang continuously, and the wars between Fu Deng and Yao Chang's Later Qin intensified after Fu Deng became Former Qin's emperor. Fu Deng set up a shrine to Fu Jiān in his army, and whenever he made a key decision he would report it to Fu Jiān. He was also described as a master of square and circular formations (although the exact mechanism is not understood well), and initially won a number of battles over Later Qin—so much so that Yao Chang, in fear, also set up a shrine dedicated to Fu Jiān in his army, apologizing for his killing of Fu Jiān and requesting forgiveness. However, after that failed to yield victories, Yao Chang cut off the head of the effigy he had made of Fu Jiān and delivered to Fu Deng. But Fu Deng's victories over Yao Chang did not appear to have lasting impact, and the wars between Former Qin and Later Qin became stalemated. Meanwhile, Fu Deng's shortcomings became exposed—an inability to take decisive action to deal heavy damage to Later Qin, and Yao Chang took advantage of his indecisive tendencies to gradually destroy other semi-independent generals in the Guanzhong region and consolidate his power base.\n\nIn 387, Fu Deng created the ruler of Western Qin, Qifu Guoren, the Prince of Wanchuan, and Qifu Guoren accepted, signifying at least nominal submission to Fu Deng. After Qifu Guoren died in 388 and was succeeded by his brother Qifu Gangui, the relationship continued.\n\nIn summer 388, Fu Yi the Crown Prince died, and Fu Deng created his own son Fu Chong to be the crown prince.\n\nIn summer 389, a battle would greatly damage Fu Deng. He had set up a base of operations at Dajie (大界, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), guarded by his wife Empress Mao, while attacking Later Qin's city of Pingliang and capturing it. Meanwhile, however, Yao Chang made a surprise attack on Dajie, capturing and killing Empress Mao and Fu Deng's sons Fu Bian the Prince of Nan'an and Fu Shang the Prince of Beihai. Some 50,000 of Fu Deng's people were captured.\n\nThen, Fu Deng gathered his remaining army and went back to Hu Kong Castle (胡空堡, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). He promoted generals such as Dou Chong (竇沖), Yang Ding (楊定), and Yang Bi (楊璧). Fu Deng attacked Zhang Longshi (張龍世) in Yangquanbao (鴦泉堡). Yao Chang sent his generals to help Zhang and set up a trap. They pretended to surrender in order to catch Fu Deng. Fu Deng, initially believing in the false surrender, avoided to be fooled with the reminding of Lei Edi (雷惡地).\n\nAfter the Battle of Dajie, Fu Deng appeared to be no longer able to again make major attacks against Later Qin, although the two states continued to battle continuously, and Yao Chang appeared to be equally unable to destroy Fu Deng. However, Yao Chang continued the consolidation process by destroying other semi-independent generals, and Later Qin grew stronger and stronger.\n\nIn 392, Fu Deng created one of his concubines, Consort Li, empress.\n\nLater in 392, Yao Chang grew ill, and Fu Deng, hearing this, made a major attack on the important Later Qin city Anding (安定, in modern Pingliang, Gansu), but Yao Chang, in his illness, nevertheless faced him in battle, forcing Fu Deng to withdraw—and then, in the engagement, made a clean evasive maneuver with his troops and disengaged, to Fu Deng's surprise, and Fu Deng commented:\n\nYao Chang died around the new year 394 and was succeeded by his son Yao Xing. While Yao Xing tried to keep news of Yao Chang's death a secret, the news still got to Fu Deng. Fu Deng, extremely glad to hear about Yao Chang's death, prepared to launch a major assault against Later Qin—he had his brother Fu Guang (苻廣) defend the base of Yongcheng (雍城, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and Fu Chong defend the base of Hu Kong Castle, and, in his anxiety, did not make sure that his army had sufficient water supply. Yao Xing set up his army at Mawei (馬嵬, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) to prevent Former Qin forces from reaching the river near Mawei, and Former Qin forces collapsed in thirst. Upon hearing the defeat, Fu Guang and Fu Chong abandoned the two bases that they were holding, and Fu Deng was unable to recapture them. He instead fled to Pingliang and then into the mountains. He sent his son Fu Zong the Prince of Ruyin to Qifu Gangui and married his sister the Princess Dongping to Qifu Gangui as his princess, seeking aid from Qifu Gangui. Qifu Gangui sent his general Qifu Yizhou (乞伏益州) to aid Fu Deng, but as Fu Deng came out of the mountains to join Qifu Yizhou's forces, Yao Xing ambushed and captured him, and then executed him. He disbanded Fu Deng's troops and gave Fu Deng's Empress Li to his general Yao Huang (姚晃).\n\n\n"}

Other countries like Morocco and Egypt, which benefited from their previous high economic growth experienced a great decline due to the global economic crisis without falling in recession.\n\nMoody's Investors Service warned on July 7, 2008 that South Africa could slip into a recession by the turn of the year.

The announcement was met with widespread condemnation, and on 29 November 2018, Chinese authorities suspended all He's research activities.\n\nBorn in Xinhua County, Loudi, Hunan in 1984, He Jiankui was educated at the University of Science and Technology of China as an undergraduate student from 2002 to 2006. He entered Rice University in 2007 and received his Ph.D degree in Biophysics under the supervision of Professor Michael W. Deem in 2010. After his PhD, he worked as a postdoc fellow with Stephen Quake at Stanford University. He moved back to China in 2012 under the Thousand Talents Program and opened a lab at the Southern University of Science and Technology. As part of the program, he was given 1 million yuan ($144,000) in angel funding, which he used to start biotech and investment companies. One of his startups is Direct Genomics, which is developing single-molecule sequencing devices based on patents invented by Quake that had been formerly been licensed by Helicos Biosciences. He also founded Vienomics Biotech, which offers genome sequencing services for people with cancer.\n\nHe took an unpaid leave from the university starting in February 2018, and began conducting the genome-editing clinical trial. On 29 November 2018, Chinese authorities suspended all He's research activities, saying He's work was \"extremely abominable in nature\" and a violation of Chinese law.\n\nIn 2010, at Rice University, He and Michael W. Deem published a paper describing some details of the CRISPR protein; this paper was part of the early work on the CRISPR/Cas9 system, before it had been adopted as a gene editing tool. \n\nIn 2017, He gave a presentation at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory describing work he did at Southern University of Science and Technology, in which he used CRISPR/Cas9 on mice, monkeys, and around 300 human embryos.\n\nHe's human gene-editing clinical trial was conducted without public discussion in the scientific community; it was first made public on November 25, 2018 when \"MIT Technology Review\" published a story about the work, based on documents that had been posted earlier that month on the Chinese clinical trials registry. After that story posted, He released a promotional video on YouTube and the next day the \"Associated Press\" published an interview with He. He had engaged a public relations firm as well. He eventually presented the work on November 27 at the International Human Genome Editing Summit in Hong Kong.\n\nThe trial had recruited couples who wanted to have children; in order to participate, the man had to be HIV-positive and the woman, uninfected. The couples were recruited through a Beijing-based AIDS advocacy group called Baihualin. As of 28 November, it was unclear whether the clinical trial had received appropriate ethical review from an institutional review board before it started, and it was unclear if the participants had given truly informed consent.\n\nHe said that he took sperm and eggs from the couples, performed in vitro fertilization with them, and then edited the genomes of the embryos using CRISPR/Cas9. The editing targeted a gene, \"CCR5\", that codes for a protein that HIV-1 uses to enter cells. He was trying to create a specific mutation in the gene, (CCR5 Δ32), that few people naturally have and that possibly confers innate resistance to HIV-1, as seen in the case of the Berlin Patient. \n\nTwin girls were conceived as a result of the in vitro fertilization. He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 given mosaicism inherent in the present state of the art in germ-line editing. \n\nHe said that he used a preimplantation genetic diagnosis process on the embryos that were edited, where three to five single cells were removed and the editing was checked. He said that parents were offered the choice of using edited or unedited embryos.\n\nThe twin girls were born in late October or early November; He said that they appeared to be healthy. When they were born, it was unclear if there might be long-term effects from the gene-editing; He was asked about his plans to monitor the children, and pay for their care should any problems arise, and how their confidentiality and that of their parents could remain protected. The names of the children used in reports, \"Lulu\" and \"Nana\", and the names of their parents, \"Mark\" and \"Grace\", are pseudonyms. \n\nHe also said at the meeting, that a second mother in his clinical trial was in the early stages of pregnancy.\n\nOnce the existence of the clinical trial was made public, He's conduct was widely condemned. \n\nChinese scientists and institutions harshly criticized He; an article in \"Nature\" stated that concerns about He's conduct were \"particularly acute in China, where scientists are sensitive to the country’s reputation as the Wild West of biomedical research\".\n\nGeneticist Eric Topol stated, \"This is far too premature .. We're dealing with the operating instructions of a human being. It's a big deal.\" Nobel prize-winning biologist David Baltimore considered the work \"irresponsible\". Developmental biologist Kathy Niakan of the Francis Crick Institute said, \"If true...this would be a highly irresponsible, unethical and dangerous use of genome editing technology.\" Medical ethicist Julian Savulescu of the University of Oxford noted, \"If true, this experiment is monstrous.\" Bioethicist Hank Greely of Stanford Law School declared, \"I unequivocally condemn the experiment.\" Biochemist Jennifer Doudna, of the University of California at Berkeley, a pioneer of the CRISPR–Cas9 technology, condemned the research. George Church, a geneticist at Harvard University, said gene editing for HIV resistance was \"justifiable\" since HIV is \"a major and growing public health threat\", but questioned the decision of this project to allow one of the embryos to be used in a pregnancy attempt, since the use of that embryo suggests that the researchers’ \"main emphasis was on testing editing rather than avoiding this disease\".\n\nArthur Caplan, bioethicist at the New York University School of Medicine, said that engineering human genes is inevitable and, although there are concerns of creating \"designer babies\", medical researchers are more interested in using the technology to prevent and treat diseases, much like the type of experiments performed by He.\n\nCarl Zimmer compared the reaction to He's human gene editing experiment to the initial reactions and subsequent debate over mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT), and the eventual regulatory approval of MRT in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Southern University of Science and Technology stated that He had been on unpaid leave since February 2018, and his research was conducted outside of their campus; the university and He's department said they were unaware of the research project and said it was inviting international experts to form an independent committee to investigate the incident, and would release the results to the public. Local authorities and the Chinese government also opened investigations.\n\nMichael W. Deem, his doctoral advisor at Rice University, was involved in the clinical trial, and was present when people involved in He's study gave consent. Deem came under investigation by Rice after news of the work was made public.\n\n\n"}

In the end, there can be only one Kamen Rider.\n\n\n was written by Toshiki Inoue and directed by Ryuta Tasaki. It features the debut of the thirteenth Kamen Rider in the continuity of \"Ryuki\": Verde. This special was first broadcast on TV Asahi on September 19, 2002. It was later released on DVD on July 21, 2003. The DVD also featured information on the characters, an interview with actor Arthur Kuroda, and an \"interview\" with some of the characters.\n\nThis television special is an alternate telling of the \"Kamen Rider Ryuki\" story. Shinji Kido's life, working as an employee at ORE Journal, takes a sharp turn after being pulled into the Mirror World by a Mispider. Luckily, he was saved by a Kamen Rider, Ryuki (Koichi Sakakibara, portrayed by Keiichi Wada). However, Sakakibara could no longer go on due to the severity of his injuries and passed his Card Deck to Shinji, allowing him to become the next Ryuki and defeat the monster. After meeting with Yui Kanzaki and Ren Akiyama (Kamen Rider Knight), Shinji learns about the conditions of the Rider War, as well as of the other Riders participating. Unable to allow such a game of death to exist like his Rider predecessor, Shinji sets out to convince all the Riders to end the senseless fighting and put an end to the War. His pleas fall upon deaf ears as just about every other Rider (except for the already-defeated Riders Raia and Scissors) sets out to hunt down Shinji and his eventual reluctant ally, Ren. Eventually, Shinji's deck is destroyed and Ren dies, after passing on the deck for Kamen Rider Knight to Shinji. The special has two different endings which were voted on by the viewers via phone at the time of the initial airing: the voted-for-air ending (in which Shinji faces the surviving Riders on his own) and the alternate ending (a resetting of the Rider War).\n\n is an alternate ending to the series, taking place after the events of episode 46. With only six Riders remaining in the Rider War; Ryuki (Shinji Kido), Knight (Ren Akiyama), Zolda (Shuichi Kitaoka), Ouja (Takeshi Asakura), and Femme (Miho Kirishima); Shiro Kanzaki alerts them to quickly settle the Rider War within three days. One of them must win and become the last survivor before the sixth surviving Rider reveals himself. Amidst the impending chaos of the fight between the Riders, Shinji discovers an unbelievable truth about the relationship between Yui Kanzaki and the Mirror World, as well as discovering the existence of his Mirror World doppelganger, Kamen Rider Ryuga.\n\n is the \"Ryuki\" Hyper Battle Video.

{"id": "18674724", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18674724", "title": "Killing of Tim McLean", "text": "Killing of Tim McLean\n\nThe killing of Tim McLean occurred on the evening of July 30, 2008. McLean, a 22-year-old Canadian man, was stabbed, beheaded and cannibalized while riding a Greyhound Canada bus about west of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, travelling the Trans-Canada Highway. On March 5, 2009, McLean's killer, the 40-year-old Chinese-Canadian Vincent Weiguang Li ( commonly just called Vince Li) (born April 30, 1968), now known as Will Baker, was found not to be criminally responsible for murder and was remanded to a high-security mental health facility in Selkirk, Manitoba, where he was detained until his release on May 8, 2015.\n\nThe incident took place near Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, during a trip from Edmonton to McLean's hometown of Winnipeg.\n\nAt 12:01 p.m. on July 30, 2008, Tim McLean (October 3, 1985 – July 30, 2008), a carnival barker, was returning home to Manitoba after working at a fair in Alberta. He departed Edmonton on board Greyhound bus 1170 to Winnipeg, via the Yellowhead Highway through Saskatchewan. He sat at the rear, one row ahead of the toilet. At 6:55 p.m., the bus departed from a stop in Erickson, Manitoba, with a new passenger, Vince Weiguang Li. Li, described as a tall man in his 40s, with a shaved head and sunglasses, originally sat near the front of the bus, but moved to sit next to McLean following a scheduled rest stop. McLean \"barely acknowledged\" Li, then fell asleep against the window pane, headphones covering his ears.\n\nAccording to witnesses, McLean was sleeping with his headphones on when the man sitting next to him suddenly produced a large knife and began stabbing McLean in the neck and chest. The bus driver pulled to the side of the road so that he and all the other passengers could exit the vehicle. The attacker then decapitated McLean and displayed his severed head to other passengers standing outside. The driver and two other men had attempted to rescue McLean but were chased away by Li, who slashed at them from behind the locked bus doors. Li then went back to McLean's body and began severing other parts and consuming some of his victim's flesh.\n\nAt 8:30 p.m., the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Portage la Prairie received a report of a stabbing on a Greyhound bus west of the city. They arrived to find the suspect still on board the bus, being prevented from escaping by another passenger, the bus driver, and a truck driver who had provided a crowbar and a hammer as weapons. The other passengers were huddled at the roadside, some of them crying and vomiting. As the suspect had earlier attempted to escape by driving the bus away, the driver had engaged the emergency immobiliser system, rendering the vehicle inoperable. Witnesses had observed the suspect stabbing and cutting McLean's body, and carrying McLean's severed head.\n\nBy 9:00 p.m., police were in a standoff with the suspect and had summoned special negotiators and a heavily armed tactical unit. The suspect alternately paced the length of the bus and defiled the corpse. Police officers then observed Li eating parts of the body. Meanwhile, the stranded passengers were transported from the scene to be interviewed at the Brandon RCMP detachment. RCMP officers reportedly heard Li say, \"I have to stay on the bus forever.\"\n\nOn July 31, 2008, at 1:30 a.m., the suspect attempted to escape from the bus by breaking through a window. The RCMP arrested Li soon afterward. He was shot with a Taser twice, handcuffed and placed in the back of a police cruiser. Parts of the victim's body, placed in plastic bags, were retrieved from the bus, while his ear, nose and tongue were found in Li's pockets. The RCMP drew criticism from members of the public who wondered why the police did not immediately board the bus and arrest Li; indeed, the officers did not at any time enter the vehicle. The victim's eyes and a part of his heart were never recovered and are presumed to have been eaten by Li.\n\nAt 10:00 a.m., Greyhound representatives took the other passengers to a local store to replace their clothes, which remained on the bus. They arrived in Winnipeg at 3:30 p.m. that day, to be reunited with family members and friends.\n\nVincent Weiguang Li, commonly known as Vince Li, was born in Dandong, Liaoning, China, on April 30, 1968. In 1992, Li graduated from University of Wuhan Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science degree in computers. From 1994–1998, Li worked in Beijing as a computer software engineer. Li immigrated to Canada from China on June 11, 2001 (though some newspapers mistakenly reported 2004) becoming a Canadian citizen on November 7, 2006. The psychiatrist Stanley Yaren, who later examined Li, said Li was hospitalized in 2003 or 2004 after an incident with the Ontario Provincial Police.\n\nHe worked in Winnipeg at menial jobs at Grant Memorial Church for six months to support his wife, Anna. Pastor Tom Castor, who employed Li, said he seemed happy to have a job and was committed to doing it well, despite a language barrier with other congregation members.\n\n\"I think he would occasionally feel frustrated with not being able to communicate or understand,\" Castor told CTV Winnipeg. \"But we have a very patient staff and he seemed to respond well.\" Castor also said Li did not show any signs of anger issues or any other trouble before he quit in the spring of 2005. He worked as a forklift operator in Winnipeg while his wife worked as a waitress.\n\nLi first moved to Edmonton in 2006, abruptly leaving his wife alone in Winnipeg until she joined him later. His jobs included service at a Wal-Mart, at a fast-food restaurant, and newspaper delivery. His delivery boss, Vincent Augert, described Li as reliable, hard-working and not showing any signs of trouble.\n\nFour weeks before the killing, he was fired from Wal-Mart following a \"disagreement\" with other employees. Shortly before the incident, Li asked for time off from his delivery job to go to Winnipeg for a job interview.\n\nAt 12:05 p.m. July 28 in Edmonton, Li boarded a Greyhound bus bound for Winnipeg.\n\nOn July 29, around 6 p.m., Li got off the bus in Erickson, Manitoba, with at least three pieces of luggage, and stayed the night on a bench next to a grocery store. According to one witness, he was seen at 3 a.m. sitting bolt upright with eyes wide open.\n\nOn the morning of July 30, still at the bench, he sold his new laptop computer to a 15-year-old boy, Darren Beatty, for $60. The laptop was seized by the RCMP as evidence; the boy was subsequently given a new laptop for his honesty by an anonymous businessman.\n\nWitness Garnet Caton said the attacker seemed oblivious to others when the stabbing occurred, adding he was struck by how calm the man was. \"There was no rage or anything. He was like a robot, stabbing the guy,\" he said. When he appeared in a Portage la Prairie courthouse on charges of second-degree murder, the only words Li reportedly uttered were pleas for someone to kill him.\n\nLi's trial commenced on March 3, 2009, with Li pleading not criminally responsible (\"aka\" insanity defense). This means he accepted that the offence occurred but claimed that he was unable to form the necessary mental element or \"mens rea\". The psychiatrist said that Li performed the attack because God's voice told him McLean was a force of evil and was about to execute him. The presiding judge, John Scurfield, accepted the diagnosis, and ruled that Li was not criminally responsible for the killing. Li was remanded to the Selkirk Mental Health Centre.\n\nThe week following the attack, Greyhound Canada announced it was pulling a series of nationwide advertisements which included the slogan, \"There's a reason you've never heard of bus rage.\" The incident has led to numerous calls and petitions demanding increased security on intercity buses.\n\nAfter the incident, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals attempted to run an ad in the \"Portage Daily Graphic\" comparing the killing of McLean to the consumption of animals. The paper's publisher refused to run the ad.\n\nThe family of Tim McLean have brought a lawsuit of $150,000 against Greyhound, the Attorney General of Canada, and Vince Li.\n\nOn June 3, 2010, Li was granted supervised outdoor walks within his mental health facility as voted by the provincial review board.\n\nOn February 16, 2011, two passengers, Debra Tucker, of Port Colborne, Ontario and Kayli Shaw, of London, Ontario filed a lawsuit against Li, Greyhound, the RCMP, and the Government of Canada for being exposed to the beheading. They were each seeking $3 million in damages. On July 14, 2015, the two women dropped their lawsuit.\n\nOn May 30, 2011, the CBC reported that Li was responding well to his psychiatric treatment and that his doctor had recommended that he receive more freedoms, phased in over several months.\n\nOn May 17, 2012, the \"National Post\" reported that Li had been granted temporary passes that would allow him out of the Selkirk Mental Health Centre for visits to the town of Selkirk, supervised by a nurse and peace officer. In an interview, Li spoke for the first time, saying that he began hearing \"the voice of God\" in 2004 and that he wanted to save the people from an alien attack.\n\nOn February 27, 2014, the CBC reported that on March 6, Li would be allowed to have unsupervised visits to Selkirk, starting at 30 minutes and expanding to full-day trips. Since 2013, he had been allowed to have supervised visits to Lockport, Winnipeg, and nearby beaches. Those visits were then relaxed.\n\nOn July 17, 2014, the \"Toronto Sun\" reported that one of the first officers on the scene, Corporal Ken Barker of the RCMP, had committed suicide. The family stated in his obituary that he was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder.\n\nOn February 27, 2015, CBC News reported that Li was given unsupervised day passes to visit Winnipeg so long as he carried a functioning cellular telephone while using them.\n\nOn May 8, 2015, CTV News reported that Li would be granted passes to group homes in the community.\n\nIn February 2016, it was reported that Li had legally changed his name and was seeking to leave his group home to live independently. He won the right to live alone in February 26 upon the recommendation of the Criminal Code Review Board.\n\nOn February 10, 2017, the Manitoba Criminal Code Review Board ordered Li be discharged. Li was granted an absolute discharge. There will be no legal obligations or restrictions pertaining to Li's independent living.\n\nOn July 9, 2018, Greyhound Canada announced that they would end virtually all service across Western Canada, including the Trans Canada route where McLean was murdered. The precipitous drop in ridership that led to the service cancellations was cited by multiple Canadian politicians as having been caused by McLean's murder.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39154711", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39154711", "title": "Life in Color", "text": "Life in Color\n\nLife in Color is a United States-based EDM event company, best known for their ongoing \"paint party\" Life in Color concert tours. The company was founded by Sebastian Solano, Paul Campbell, Lukasz Tracz and Patryk Tracz as Committee Entertainment and the concert tour Dayglow in 2006. Billed by its organizers as the \"world's largest paint party\", the tour features performances by electronic musicians, joined by artistic performers and the tour's signature spraying of the audience with paint throughout the show. The company changed to its current name shortly after it was acquired by Robert F. X. Sillerman's SFX Entertainment in late 2012, with the original founders remaining as partners.\n\nBeginning in 2013, the promotion began to produce Life in Color Festival, a music festival with multiple stages and a larger lineup of performers. Life in Color's annual festival event in Miami is considered to be its flagship.\n\nCEO Sebastian Solano has described the increasingly choreographed Life in Color events as being \"almost like a Broadway show, but with such an energized crowd you would need to see it to believe it\"; the shows feature live sets by DJs accompanied by various artistic, circus-styled performers. Throughout the show, the audience is sprayed with non-toxic paint through various means (including hoses on-stage and personal paint bottles); attendees are encouraged to dress in white clothing to serve as a \"canvas\" for the paint. A countdown is also held to a special \"paint blast\" during the show, which features a mixture of paint and confetti.\n\n\nLife in Color was founded as Dayglow by four students living in Florida in 2006. Sebastian Solano, Paul Campbell, Lukasz Tracz and Patryk Tracz all were housemates at an apartment on the Florida State University (FSU) campus. That year all four began throwing themed \"super extravagant house parties\" on a monthly basis, bringing in DJ Climax for the music. Reinvesting the monthly profits, often at a loss, eventually they began renting \"half a nightclub\" at a time with bottle and limousine service, then bringing the party back to their house afterwards. As the parties grew in size and popularity, the four founders named themselves Committee Entertainment, planning events as partners. All founders were avid fans of house music, and took different roles. Clubs soon began paying the small company to bring their parties, and according to Solano, they were some of the few local promoters at the time to focus on EDM.\nSoon a friend introduced Solano to an informal party series called Dayglow, \"a fraternity and sorority tradition at FSU\" that involved hundreds of college students in white shirts throwing non-toxic paint on one-another. Solano had recently discovered ID&T's travelling event series Sensation, explaining to \"Billboard\" that \"I just couldn't believe that a party could be taken to a level where 50,000 people would show up in a stadium. Just to party, right? Not for Madonna. But just for an actual party. Immediately, I started to go deep into research on Sensation, ID&T and founder Duncan Stutterheim. It just really interested me.\" After experiencing a Dayglow event, Solano felt that it could become the \"Sensation of America\", and began to pursue the idea of a traveling Dayglow tour.\n\nHe and Committee Entertainment registered trademarks for Dayglow, and in 2007 their first Dayglow event was held in a Miami nightclub called Allure, with close to 600 attendees. The company then contacted other Florida cities such as Orlando, Tampa, and Gainesville, and began pitching the Dayglow parties. Eventually they decided to rent out the UCF Arena, though Solano stated that at the time, they \"had no idea how to do a real concert.\" All four founders dropped out of college to pursue the venture.\n\nAs the tour increased in popularity, the shows grew more extravagant in nature: booking larger acts and increasing the magnitude of its artistic elements. When the Dayglow tour started traveling to cities outside of Florida, the founders custom-built paint cannons and guns, also hiring someone from Cirque du Soleil to run their performance department. Solano stated in an interview with Pollstar that \"We were the first dance music brand, including DJs, to ever do a college tour. Once we did our first college tour, 25 colleges, and sold out every show in about five minutes.\" By 2009 the tour had become more established, and in 2009 and 2010, a \"Dayglow\" stage was held at Ultra Music Festival.\n\nThe 2011 Dayglow tour was entitled \"BLU\", standing for \"Beats, Love, and Unity\"; symbolically, the events featured a special paint blast with blue paint. Also in 2011 shows were held at locations such as the Philadelphia Navy Yard, with headliners such as Roger Sanchez and Diplo. A 2011 stop at Stabler Arena in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania was met with such high demand that, after an initial sell-out, it was moved to Lehigh University's larger Rauch Fieldhouse: the additional tickets quickly sold out as well. However, following the event, 6 attendees were arrested for intoxication and disorderly conduct, while 35 attendees were sent to local hospitals with symptoms of dehydration and possible drug or alcohol useRobert Mateff, the Northampton County's Director of Emergency Management, considered the scenario to be \"atypical\" for a planned event in the area. Organizers stated that all attendees were checked for alcohol and other illegal substances before entering.\n\nAccording to Solano, dance music promoter Disco Donnie served as an early mentor to DayGlow, and on Donnie's recommendation they held back from selling for several years. In 2012 Donnie then connected Solano with investor Bob Sillerman, who at the time was putting together the media conglomerate SFX Entertainment. After negotiations, DayGlow agreed to sell the franchise to SFX, becoming SFX's second acquisition after Disco Donnie. Stated Solano, \"It wasn’t just about the money but it was about the people we were going to be working with... people like Shelly Finkel, Bob Sillerman and Mitch Slater.\" Also, \"[We liked] the idea of SFX being global.\" After the acquisition by SFX, all four founders remained executives in the company.\n\nShortly after its acquisition, the company announced in September 2012 that it would re-brand itself as Life in Color. The company's late-2012 tour was entitled \"The E.N.D.: Electronic Never Dies\". On December 31, 2012, a special \"Life in Color NYE Bash\" was held and webcast from Atlantic City, headlined by Steve Aoki, Tommy Trash, and Adventure Club.\n\nThe 2013 tour was entitled \"Life in Color Rebirth\". It toured in over 25 countries, with a plan to expand the following year. At that point, headlining DJs had included Afrojack, Axwell, Alesso, Benny Benassi, Chuckie, R3hab, etc. Regular features in shows beyond \"paint blasts\" included \"aerial acts, stilt walkers, contortionists, and fire shows.\" In 2013, Life in Color began to hold larger music festival events, featuring multiple stages and a larger lineup. The first of these two one-day festivals occurred in Washington, D.C. on September 21, 2013.\n\nOn August 7, 2013, organizers announced that a Life in Color Festival would be held outside Sun Life Stadium in Miami on December 27, 2013. The announcement coincided with the final of the 2013 International Champions Cup soccer tournament, which was also held at Sun Life Stadium; R3hab and David Solano performed during pre-game and halftime festivities respectively as part of the announcement, making them the \"first EDM brand to produce a nationally televised halftime show in North America.\" According to Solano, the Miami festival was the new \"flagship\" event of the company as of 2013, with goals to plot festivals on every continent in 2014. The event featured multiple stages, and featured appearances by 2 Chainz, Calvin Harris, Diplo, Excision, and Major Lazer among others. The 2013 festival had 25,000 attendees over one night.\n\nThe 2014 arena tour was entitled \"Unleash\", and Solano stated in an interview stated that as of June 25, 2014 they had shows in 55 countries. An April 2014 \"Life in Color\" event in Malaysia, headlined by Fedde le Grand, was planned in partnership with local promoter Future Sound Asia, but cancelled in March 2014 out of respect for drug-related deaths at Future Music Festival Asia (which caused the final day of the festival to be cancelled) and an unrelated, but similar incident at an \"A State of Trance 650\" event in North Jakarta the same weekend.\n\nLife in Color returned to the 2014 International Champions Cup final to announce its 2014 festival with a halftime performance by Martin Garrix. The 2014 festival was expanded to two days, December 26 and 27, 2014: Solano expected a total attendance of at least 60,000. The event was headlined by Adventure Club, Borgore, The Chainsmokers, Diplo, Kaskade, Nervo, and Madeon among others, and also featured an attempt to set a Guinness World Record for the \"most people covered in paint at one time\".\n\nOn January 5, 2015, \"Forbes\" included Solano on their annual list of \"30 Under 30 In Music\" for 2015. He was the only event owner on the list, which largely included musicians and producers such as Martin Garrix and Afrojack.\n\nIn November 2015, SFX Entertainment promoted Solano to CEO of ID&T North America and Made Event; in addition to his role as head of Life in Color, he will also oversee Electric Zoo and the North American editions of ID&T's festival brands, including Mysteryland and TomorrowWorld.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23036511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23036511", "title": "List of expenses claims in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal", "text": "List of expenses claims in the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal\n\nThis article lists the published allegations of expenses abuse made against specific members of the British Parliament in the course of the United Kingdom parliamentary expenses scandal. While the majority of these were first made public by \"The Daily Telegraph\" on or after 8 May 2009, a few cases had already come to public attention before that date.\n\nOn 18 June 2009 the details of all MP's claims for the period 2004 to 2008 were published on the official Parliament website together with details of voluntary repayments amounting to approximately £500,000.\n\nThe John Lewis List is the name given to a list used by House of Commons Clerks to ascertain whether or not claims by MPs under the Additional Costs Allowance (ACA) are a realistic representation of the price of items. The list details items that are considered acceptable to be claimed on the ACA, along with the price such items would cost in the John Lewis department store chain.\n\nPrior to 2008 the list was never published in case MPs saw the maximum permitted claim for each item and such a price \"became the going rate\", a rule House of Commons' resources chief Andrew Walker upheld in February 2008 despite campaigners wanting it released to the Information Tribunal considering the release of MPs' expenses claims. However, a freedom of information request by the Press Association just a month later, in March 2008, saw the list released into the public domain anyway, revealing that MPs were able to claim for, among other things, dishwashers, television sets and tumble dryers.\n\nDerek Conway, the MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup then under the Conservative whip, was found to have employed his son, Frederick, as a part-time research assistant in his parliamentary office between 2004 and 2007, with an annual salary of £10,000, despite Frederick being a full-time undergraduate student at Newcastle University. This arrangement was revealed by \"The Sunday Times\" on 27 May 2007, in an article which prompted a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, who in turn referred the matter to the House of Commons Standards and Privileges Committee.\n\nThe committee launched an investigation into the matter as a whole, and reported to the House on 28 January 2008. On the same day, Conway apologised on the floor of the Commons, stating that he accepted the report's criticisms \"in full\". The report's main finding was that there was \"no record\" of Frederick ever doing any substantive work for Conway, and that the salary he was paid was too high. The committee ordered Conway to repay £13,000 of the money Frederick had been paid, and recommended that Conway should be suspended from the Commons for ten sitting days. These recommendations were approved, in their entirety, by the House of Commons on 31 January 2008.\n\nAt the time of Conway's suspension, the Labour MP John Mann announced that he would be making a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards over Conway's employment of his other son, Henry, in a similar capacity to Frederick. Shortly after Conway's suspension and the second allegation being made, the Conservative leader, David Cameron, withdrew the party whip from Conway, effectively leaving him sitting as an Independent MP. Conway subsequently announced that he would not be standing for re-election at the next general election.\n\nIn January 2009, a year after the first report, the Committee on Standards and Privileges published a further report, specifically in relation to Conway's employment of his son Henry. The committee found that Henry had been employed immediately prior to Frederick and, similarly, had been studying as a full-time undergraduate at the time of his employment. The committee reported that, like the previous case, there was no \"hard evidence\" of Henry's employment, but also stated that it would be unfair to conclude that Henry Conway did not undertake sufficient work to fulfil the terms of his contract of employment\n\nThe committee ordered Conway to repay £3,758 in over payments to his son, and to also write a letter of apology to the committee's chairman, Sir George Young. Once again, Conway apologised \"without qualification\" to the Commons.\n\nCaroline Spelman, the then Chairman of the Conservative Party, became embroiled in the \"nannygate\" saga on 6 June 2008 when the BBC's \"Newsnight\" programme suggested she had paid for her nanny out of parliamentary expenses during her early years in Parliament, between 1997 and 1998. Spelman issued a statement to \"Newsnight\" that the nanny in question, Tina Haynes, was also her constituency secretary. The Conservative Central Office agreed with her claim. Immediately after the revelations were made public, the nanny told \"Newsnight\" that she only took the odd phone message or posted documents when needed. In the following days, however, Haynes stated that her work had, in fact, been on a more formal basis, providing constituency secretarial work when Spelman's children were at school.\n\nIn an attempt to resolve the situation and clear her name, Spelman asked John Lyons, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, to investigate the payments to Haynes. However, the commissioner himself suggested that an investigation dating back seven years would be exceptional, especially on a self-referral. Despite this, the commissioner announced on 17 June that he would launch a formal investigation into the saga.\n\nDuring the commissioner's investigation, \"Newsnight\" revealed that nine years earlier, Spelman's parliamentary secretary, Sally Hammond, had raised concerns over the \"nannygate\" payments with the leadership of the Conservative party. In 1998, Hammond informed Peter Ainsworth, a member of the Shadow Cabinet, who in turn referred the matter to the then Opposition Chief Whip, James Arbuthnot, who investigated and told Spelman to stop paying Haynes out of parliamentary expenses immediately.\n\nIn March 2009, the Committee for Standards and Privileges published their final report into the matter, which ruled that Spelman had inadvertently \"misapplied part of [her] parliamentary allowances\". However, both the Committee and the Commissioner noted that Spelman was, at the time, one of many new members who had taken their seats following the 1997 general election, and was therefore not fully aware of the rules governing the use or purpose of parliamentary allowances. The committee recommended that Spelman repay £9,600.\n\nIn September 2007, the married couple and Labour Cabinet ministers, Ed Balls, the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, and Yvette Cooper, then the Housing Minister, were accused of exploiting the Commons' allowances system in order to pay for a £655,000 house in Stoke Newington, North London.\n\nThe couple subsequently declared this to be their second home, despite spending most of their time in London in order to fulfil their ministerial responsibilities and their children attending London schools. The declaration of the Stoke Newington property as their second home meant that they became eligible for a reported Additional Costs Allowance (ACA) of £44,000 a year to cover the property's £438,000 mortgage.\n\nThe Conservative MP Malcolm Moss made a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, who agreed to launch an investigation into the matter. The commissioner ultimately found that the couple had acted in accordance with parliamentary rules and as such dismissed the complaint against them. The Committee on Standards and Privileges agreed with the Commissioner's dismissal of the complaint.\n\nSir Nicholas and Lady Winterton, the married backbench Conservative MPs, were accused of claiming back mortgage interest through the Additional Cost Allowance (ACA) on a flat they owned in London, despite having completed payment of the mortgage itself. It was further alleged that the pair had subsequently transferred the ownership of the flat to a trust and then claimed £21,600 a year in rent for the flat.\n\nA complaint was made about this arrangement by two members of the public to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, who in turn launched an investigation. The commissioner found that a change in the allowances rules in 2003 appeared to complicate matters as it may have placed the Wintertons' arrangement outside of the rules, and ruled it was \"unfortunate\" that the couple never reassessed their situation following the change in rules. The commissioner also ruled that a further change to allowance rules in 2006 meant that there was a clear breach of the rules, but noted that the Wintertons would not have received any additional public funds for their arrangement than they would have if they had resided in a different property under more acceptable arrangements. It was also noted that the Wintertons had never attempted to conceal the arrangement. The Committee on Standards and Privileges agreed with the Commissioner's report and ruled that the payment of the Additional Costs Allowance to the Wintertons should be stopped. Notably however, they did not order the Wintertons to repay any money they had previously claimed.\n\nIn a separate debate, the Wintertons are two of only six Conservative MPs who have refused to disclose their full expenses claims, despite orders to do so by party leader, David Cameron.\n\nIn February 2009, the \"Mail on Sunday\" reported that the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith, had listed her constituency home in Redditch, Worcestershire as her second home, whilst designating a house she shared with her sister in London as her main home, despite sometimes spending as little as two nights there, allowing her to claim £116,000 in Additional Cost Allowance over several years. A key aspect in the debate was the fact that Smith, as Home Secretary, was eligible for a \"grace and favour\" home in Westminster, and therefore did not need to claim expenses to live with her sister. The \"Daily Mail\" reported that, despite several MPs complaining to him about the affair, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards would not be launching an investigation into Smith's expenses because there was \"not sufficient evidence for an inquiry\". However, after the residents of the house next-door to Smith's sister complained to him, stating that Smith may only stay there for three nights a week, he requested that Smith explain her arrangements.\n\nA month after allegations were made against Smith's second home arrangements, the \"Sunday Express\" revealed that Smith had claimed as parliamentary expenses for two Pay-TV pornographic films her husband, Richard Timney, had watched while she was away. Smith and her husband both apologised for the error, and Smith said she would pay back the claim. This, coupled with the previous allegation, led to mounting pressure of Smith to resign, but the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, gave her his full support, before proposing alterations to the existing expenses system.\n\nIn April 2009, Smith came under increasing pressure after yet further questions were raised about her expenses by the \"Mail on Sunday\". The newspaper suggested that Smith had claimed for several items that were supposed to allow her to \"perform her duties as an MP\", including a toothbrush, a patio heater, a barbecue, a flat-screen TV and a bath plug costing 89p. On 2 June 2009, she announced she would stand down at the Cabinet reshuffle on 5 June 2009.\n\nIn March 2009, Labour minister Tony McNulty (then Minister for London, Minister for Employment and MP for Harrow East) admitted claiming expenses on a second home, occupied by his parents, which was eight miles away from his primary residence, after details appeared in the \"Mail on Sunday\". He asserted that the claim was appropriate, but ceased claiming the allowances. In an article headlined \"Tony McNulty, Benefit Cheat\", \"The Spectator\" on 26 March 2009 contrasted the statements made by McNulty regarding benefit cheats with his own claims for expenses. He resigned during the Cabinet reshuffle of 5 June 2009.\n\nOn 26 March 2009, Conservative MP Eric Pickles (Brentwood and Ongar) appeared on the political debate programme \"Question Time\". While discussing the controversy over Tony McNulty, Pickles admitted he claimed a second home allowance even though his constituency home was only 37 miles from Westminster. Pickles justified himself by saying ”the House of Commons works on clockwork. You have to be there. If you're on a committee, you have to be there precisely.\" Host David Dimbleby responded \"Like a job, in other words?\" reflecting the reality that many of Pickles' own constituents commute to London each day.\n\nThe following details are sorted by party in descending order of parliamentary size of the party at the time of the scandal.\n\nThe \"Telegraph\" devoted the first two days of coverage to the expenses of the governing Labour Party, beginning with the Cabinet on day one, before turning to junior ministers and Labour backbenchers on the second day, Saturday 9 May. Further allegations were made on Thursday, 14 May. The main allegations the newspaper made, alongside any responses to them from the various MPs are shown below.\n\nAlthough focusing on Labour MPs on days one and two, on the evening of 10 May, the \"Telegraph\" website reported that the newspaper was preparing to publish the expenses claims of Conservative MPs in the next day's edition. It also began publishing the stories online that evening.\nThe day after these particular revelations began, the Leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, announced that all questionable claims by the Shadow Cabinet would be repaid, including those made by Michael Gove, Oliver Letwin, Francis Maude and Chris Grayling. Cameron himself repaid a £680 repair bill that included the clearing of wisteria from his chimney.\n\nOn the evening of 11 May, the \"Daily Telegraph\" announced it was turning its attention on the claims of backbench Conservative MPs whom the newspaper dubbed \"the grandees\" of the party.\n\nThose claims and further revelations are listed below:\n\n\nThe Liberal Democrats became the focus of the \"Daily Telegraph\"'s revelations on day 6 of the publications. The allegations made alongside responses from the MPs are listed below.\n\nOn 10 May 2009, \"The Sunday Telegraph\" reported that the five Sinn Féin MPs together claimed nearly £500,000 in second home allowances, despite never taking up their seats at Westminster due to the party's abstentionist policy. In its defence, Sinn Féin stated that its members often have to travel to London on parliamentary business.\n\n"}

Once they are sufficiently well-established, the perpetrators then purchase the next round of goods on credit and decamp with both the goods and profits from previous sales. The goods can then be sold elsewhere. The procedure needs a certain amount of money to set up, often the proceeds from another crime or a previous long firm. Sometimes the individual who does jail time for assisting with the fraud is paid for their time served.\n\nLong firm frauds have become significantly less common in recent years since it is no longer possible to operate for any length of time without leaving a significant paper trail.\n"}

The group studied under Ban-dar Marui and read the book \"Gladiator of Passion\".\n\nOn February 15, 2000, Hamlan received a passport and after completing the Hajj, went to Sharjah, UAE, to obtain a visa to enter Pakistan. Once in Islamabad, Pakistan, he and two co-travelers were led by Hassan Ghul to a waypoint controlled by Abu Zubaydah. By March, they had crossed the border into Afghanistan where he attended the Al Khaldan training camp. When the camp was closed, he moved with its other members to Al-Farouq outside Kandahar, where he met Osama bin Laden. After injuring himself at the camp, Hamlan was assigned to guard Kandahar Airport, a task that the eventual hijackers Saeed al-Ghamdi and Waleed al-Shehri shared.\n\nDuring his time at Al-Farooq and the airport, Hamlan is thought to have befriended Ahmed al-Nami. The two of them studied under Abu Basir al-Yemeni, who coaxed them to enlist with Abu Hafs al Mauritani as potential 'martyrs' who would carry out suicide missions inside the United States.\n\nHamlan and Nami were sent to meet bin Laden, identifying themselves through the phrase \"I want to be one of this religion's bricks and glorify this religion\". In October 2000, Hamlan and Nami met with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed who instructed them on encrypting telephone calls. They also had their passports falsified to suggest that they were world travelers visiting locations such as Singapore, Malaysia, Egypt and Turkey. After a meeting with Muhammad Atef, they flew to Tehran, Iran, onward to Qatar and back into the UAE before arriving in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. On instructions from Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, they drove to Jeddah, where they stayed with the future hijacker Waleed al-Shehri. He instructed them how to obtain US visas, which both received on October 28.\n\nHamlan did not use his visa. Immediately after they were issued their visas, Hamlan phoned his family and learned that his mother was ill. He decided not to pursue martyrdom and returned to his family.

Past participants include Dropbox, Beam, Vurb, Trello, Mint, Yammer, and Crate.io.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2015, TechCrunch operated Crunchbase, a database of the startup ecosystem, consisting of investors, incubators, start-ups, key people, funds, funding rounds and events. The company claims to have more than 50,000 active contributors on its platform. Subject to registration, members of the public can make submissions to the database; however, all changes are subject to review by a moderator before being accepted.\n\nIn 2013, Crunchbase claimed to have 2 million users accessing its database each month.\n\nAOL is in dispute with start-up Pro Populi over that group's use of the entire Crunchbase dataset in apps that Pro Populi has developed, one of which is known as People+. Pro Populi is being represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nIn 2015, Crunchbase spun out of AOL/Verizon/TechCrunch to become a private entity, and is no longer a part of TechCrunch.\n\nIn 2008, TechCrunch started The Crunchies award ceremony, which celebrates the \"most compelling startups, internet and technology innovations of the year\". Techcrunch often creates a list of the top startups and the funding they received. Twelve categories have been awarded in 2016, including \"Best New Startup\", \"Best Overall Startup\", and \"Best Mobile App\". 2016 was also the first year awarding the Diversity Award.\n\nTechCrunch has more than 10.07 million followers on Twitter, and more than 2.8 million likes on Facebook as of February 2018.\n\nIn 2014, TechCrunch Disrupt was featured in an arc of the HBO series \"Silicon Valley\". The characters' startup \"Pied Piper\" participates on a startup battle at TechCrunch Disrupt.\n\nTechCrunch is currently available in English, Chinese (managed by TechNode), and Japanese. It had a French edition, which was folded into TechCrunch.com.\n\n"}
{"id": "45573891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45573891", "title": "The Daily Stormer", "text": "The Daily Stormer\n\nThe Daily Stormer is an American neo-Nazi, white supremacist, and Holocaust denial commentary and message board website that advocates for the genocide of Jews. It considers itself a part of the alt-right movement. Its editor, Andrew Anglin, founded it on July 4, 2013, as a faster-paced replacement for his previous website \"Total Fascism\".\n\nThe site is known for its use of Internet memes, which have been likened to the imageboard 4chan and cited as attractions for a younger and more ideologically diverse audience. While some white nationalist authors have praised \"The Daily Stormer\"s reach, others have taken issue with its content and tone, accusing Anglin of being an agent provocateur, used to discredit true white nationalism.\n\n\"The Daily Stormer\" orchestrates what it calls the \"Troll Army\", which is involved in Internet trolling of figures with whom Anglin disagrees politically. In August 2017, after causing outrage by insulting the victim of a car-ramming homicide at the far-right Unite the Right rally, the website was rejected by several domain registrars.\n\nAndrew Anglin was born on July 27, 1984, and grew up near Columbus, Ohio. According to both Anglin and his childhood classmates, he was liberal as a youth. He attended the Linworth Alternative Program and the Worthington Christian High School from 1999 to 2003, where he was remembered as a dreadlocked vegan. His friends in high school report that his behavior changed during his sophomore year at Linworth, where he exhibited self-harming behavior, and began promoting conspiracy theories. After high school, Anglin took classes at Columbus State Community College in 2003, and studied English at Ohio State University for one semester in 2004.\n\nIn 2006 Anglin launched a conspiracy theory website, \"Outlaw Journalism\", which was modeled after the works of Alex Jones and Hunter S. Thompson, whom Anglin admired.\n\nIn 2008, after posting on \"Outlaw Journalism\" that the only way for humanity to survive was to return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, Anglin began traveling around Southeast Asia, eventually ending up in Davao City, in the Philippines. In 2011, he spent several weeks with a Tboli village in southern Mindanao, where he initially intended to stay permanently, selling some of his possessions to raise money for a dowry to marry two local Muslim women. In 2012, Anglin wrote that he found the locals to be \"a civilized, non-aggressive and industrious people\" but he eventually came to consider them too \"primitive\", became lonely and only wanted to associate with members of his own race, and \"By the Grace of God, I found Adolf Hitler\".\n\nIn 2012, Anglin launched another website, Adventure Quest 2012, which discussed conspiracy theories such as the existence of reptilian humanoids. He described the aim of the site as seeking to \"mend the wounds produced by modern society ... and [help] the reader transcend these physical bonds and reach total ascendancy. To mend these wounds, the world must learn to embrace diversity and color.\" In 2014, he stated that although he agreed with the central tenets of Nazism, he had reservations over reintroducing all aspects of Hitler's regime. A self-proclaimed \"troll\", Anglin stated that he was introduced to Nazism on 4chan. Later in 2012, he launched his first neo-Nazi website, \"Total Fascism\". Feeling that \"Total Fascism\" was not appealing to a younger demographic and had articles that were too long, Anglin launched \"The Daily Stormer\" on July 4, 2013, with shorter articles and a more provocative style. Anglin said in March 2014 he spends 70 hours a week writing for the website.\n\nAnglin's location is not known. An investigative article by \"The Huffington Post\" in November 2016 analyzed his social media and FBI sources, and concluded that he was living in Germany. Rumors have also claimed that he is residing in Russia. In July 2017, Anglin told CNN he was residing in Lagos, Nigeria. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists the site as being headquartered in Worthington, Ohio, with activity in several other states. The website is registered in the name of Anglin's father Greg, who runs a Christian-inspired counseling service in Worthington.\n\n\"The Daily Stormer\" is primarily funded through donations which Anglin solicits regularly from site visitors. His father was protested against by Anti-Racist Action for receiving donations from the site's readers to pass on to his son. In February 2017, the website announced a corporate sponsor—Smerff Electrical, owned by Simon Hickey of Brisbane, Australia, whose website contains images of alt-right meme Pepe the Frog. Anglin told \"Mother Jones\" that he received donations from Silicon Valley, and that Santa Clara County, California was the largest source of traffic to his website.\n\nThe site is believed to have received over $200,000 in Bitcoin contributions since it began accepting the cryptocurrency in 2014. A current cryptocurrency wallet has consistently kept approximately $80,000 in Bitcoin on hand. Money entering and being spent by the accounts is publicly tracked by a Twitter bot. A Twitter account for the \"Stormer\" announced that Coinbase was deleting accounts of persons attempting to send Bitcoin to them; Coinbase stated in general terms that it \"prohibits use of an account which would abuse, harass, threaten, or promote violence against others\". On August 20, 2017, for example, Anglin received a donation of 14.88 bitcoin (a reference to Fourteen Words). At the time, it was worth $60,000, but had Anglin kept the entire amount it would have been worth about $235,000 by the end of the year.\n\n\"The Daily Stormer\" is run through a company called Moonbase Holdings, with Anglin saying that he chose the name so that donors could avoid scrutiny from their credit card companies. The company made $3,400 per month on the alt-right crowdfunding website Hatreon, which ceased operations in February 2017. In his defamation lawsuit against Anglin, Muslim American radio personality Dean Obeidallah requested that Moonbase Holdings be scrutinized to find any other individuals related with the company.\n\n\"The Daily Stormer\" takes its name from the Nazi Party's tabloid newspaper \"Der Stürmer\", known for its virulently antisemitic caricatures of Jews. Its publisher, Julius Streicher, was executed after the Second World War for crimes against humanity.\n\nThe SPLC described the site as \"the newest up and comer in the heated competition to rule the hate web\", which \"has in the last six months [up to March 2015] often topped the oldest and largest hate site on the web, Stormfront, in terms of reach and page views, based on Alexa data\". Anglin claimed in May 2016 that the website's traffic had doubled over the last six months, peaking at 120,000 daily visitors. The website is part of the alt-right movement, and it calls itself \"The World’s Most Visited Alt-Right Website\". As the movement made headlines in mid-2016, \"bolstered in part by the unexpected rise of Donald Trump and Britain's decision to leave the European Union\", Anglin declared: \"We won the meme war; now we've taken over the GOP, and we did this very, very quickly.\" Unlike other figures such as Milo Yiannopoulos, Anglin does not play down the extremist elements in the alt-right, stating that: \"The goal is to ethnically cleanse White nations of non-Whites and establish an authoritarian government. Many people also believe that the Jews should be exterminated\".\n\nAnglin asserts that the purpose of \"The Daily Stormer\" is to provide \"a means to propagandize people … to get them to look at the world in a certain way\". Headlines include \"All Intelligent People in History Disliked Jews\", and \"Adolf Hitler: The Most Lied About Man of All Time\". The site bills itself as \"America's #1 Most-Trusted Republican News Source\". According to \"The Jewish Chronicle\", \"The Daily Stormer\" \"posts hundreds of racist articles targeting black people, Arabs and Jews\". The website offers pro-separatist coverage of the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, which Anglin considers \"the correct moral position\". \n\nThe SPLC stated that \"The Daily Stormer\" owed its success to the online imageboard 4chan becoming popular among racists, as both websites use similar memes and rhetorical styles. One meme the website has used is to overlay photographs of Taylor Swift with anti-Semitic quotations, including those by Hitler. The website puts triple parentheses around the names of Jews, a far-right meme created by fellow website The Right Stuff. Jacob Siegel of \"The Daily Beast\" wrote that the website was growing in popularity amongst a younger audience due to its use of humor, and was attracting activists of other anti-political correctness ideologies—such as Gamergaters, men's rights activists and opponents of Social Justice Warriors—who would not usually identify with fascism. The SPLC has also documented Anglin's involvement in and encouragement of culture jamming by making hyperbolic statements in fake online accounts as women and minorities. He has also said that \"ridiculous\" statements such as \"gas the kikes\", if repeated in media coverage, can work to desensitize the public to the Holocaust. He also believes that his extreme right-wing rhetoric can normalize less extreme right-wingers such as Trump. In December 2017, \"The Huffington Post\" leaked Anglin's 17-page style guide for the website, which included the guideline that articles must be so extremely hyperbolic that readers would be unsure whether the content is parody.\n\nThe hacker and Internet troll known as \"weev\" (Andrew Alan Escher Auernheimer), wrote an article on the website after his release from prison in October 2014, espousing his recent conversion to Neo-Nazism and his opposition to Jews who had built \"an empire of wickedness the likes the world has never seen\". Fredrick Brennan, founder of the online community 8chan, wrote an article on \"The Daily Stormer\" encouraging eugenics, based on his own experiences of having brittle bone disease. Florida-based Jewish troll Joshua Ryne Goldberg, who encouraged a 2015 attack on a free speech exhibition in Garland, Texas, under the alias of a Muslim extremist, wrote white supremacist articles for \"The Daily Stormer\" under the pseudonym Michael Slay. \"The Daily Stormer\" accepts freelance work and pays $14.88 per article. The second most prolific writer on the website goes by the pseudonym \"Zeiger\" and was unmasked in 2018 by the \"Montreal Gazette\" as Gabriel Sohier Chaput, an IT consultant from Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie, Quebec.\n\n\"The Daily Stormer\" attracted media coverage when the SPLC stated that white supremacist spree killer Dylann Roof—who on June 17, 2015, shot nine African Americans to death in the Charleston church shooting—may have made several comments on the site. The SPLC found similarities between one user's comments and Roof's manifesto. \"The Daily Beast\" stated that Anglin \"repudiated Roof's crime and publicly disavowed violence, while endorsing many of Roof's views\". In October of that year, Anglin gave a positive reaction to an attempted assassination on Henriette Reker, a pro-immigration candidate to be mayor of the German city of Cologne, decrying her as a \"feminist hag\".\n\nIn May 2017, weev set up the first non-English version of \"The Daily Stormer\", \"El Daily Stormer\" in Spanish. It is focused on news related to white nationalism in Spain and Latin America.\n\nAnglin officially endorsed Donald Trump for president in 2015. Anglin encouraged the website's readers to \"vote for the first time in our lives for the one man who actually represents our interests\". The website also received national and international coverage for its endorsement of Trump's proposal of a temporary moratorium on admitting foreign Muslims into the country; it proclaimed \"Heil Donald Trump – \"The Ultimate Savior\"\". According to the SPLC, white supremacist endorsement of Trump is unprecedented, as the movement is generally skeptical of all politicians. In July 2016, Andrew Anglin and \"The Daily Stormer\" were mentioned by Lacy Clay, Democratic Representative from Missouri, as he asked in a congressional hearing whether FBI director James Comey was aware of Trump sharing Twitter posts by white supremacists. Anglin wrote in July 2016 that he believed that Trump was a pragmatic anti-Semite who praised Israel to win votes from evangelical Christians, while dropping subtle hints about purported Jewish domination of rival Hillary Clinton's campaign. \"The Huffington Post\" journalist Jessica Schulberg compared how white nationalists like Anglin and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke believed Trump to be representative of their ethnic interests, while at the same time several Jews believed him to be representative of theirs.\n\nIn \"The Daily Telegraph\", Trump supporter Crystal Wright wrote that the candidate needed to separate himself from white nationalists such as \"The Daily Stormer\", who were endorsing him ahead of other politicians they deemed \"cuckservatives\" for holding more liberal positions. Writing for \"The Atlantic\", Conor Friedersdorf theorized that modern academia's focus on race rather than \"color-blind\" individualism was causing divisions and allowing white nationalist sites such as \"The Daily Stormer\" to gain an audience, and therefore become a \"tiny but nevertheless alarming portion\" of Trump's support. Al Jazeera writer Malcolm Harris analyzed the endorsement and predicted that a Trump presidency would strengthen organized racist groups and lead to civil war.\n\nAfter Trump won the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Anglin called on the site's readers to use non-violent intimidation to make \"brown people\" feel unwelcome in America, and to goad disappointed supporters of Clinton into committing suicide.\n\nIn response to the bombing of the Syrian government's Shayrat Airbase in 2017, \"The Daily Stormer\" was one of several alt-right outlets that criticized Trump. While Anglin alleged the president could be under control of a purportedly Jewish deep state, weev said in a video on the website that he retained faith in Trump from his past actions.\n\nWhite nationalist websites such as Stormfront and Counter-Currents have taken issue with what they see as lowbrow coverage on \"The Daily Stormer\", as well as Anglin's defense of Christianity and denunciation of the white supremacist group Christian Identity. Kyle Rogers of the Council of Conservative Citizens has also criticized the website for reprinting its material. Anglin has also been criticized for his relationships with non-white women in the Philippines, and for his insults towards white women on his website.\n\nColin Liddell of AlternativeRight.com has criticized Anglin's beliefs and tone. Liddell, who believes that stopping migration and encouraging higher birthrates is more important for preserving the white race, condemned Anglin for writing that it was impossible for the race to survive without adopting his views on Jews, Hitler and the Holocaust. Liddell considered that Anglin was attracting poor whites with his provocative online persona in the same manner as monster trucks and professional wrestling, writing that \"it is hard not to conclude that Anglin is a paid shill and agent provocateur, whose purpose is simply to infest and discredit White nationalism\". Jared Taylor of \"American Renaissance\" criticized \"The Daily Stormer\" \"extremely harsh, dismissive and insulting tone toward blacks\", which he called unhelpful.\n\nOthers, such as the Traditionalist Youth Network, have praised \"The Daily Stormer\" for its reach and influence. Anglin's extreme tone has led some white nationalists to suspect that he is an undercover Jew, an accusation he finds analogous to believing that Jewish LGBT activist Allen Ginsberg was an undercover Nazi.\n\n\"The Daily Stormer\" orchestrates what it calls a \"Troll Army\", involved in Internet trolling. It came to attention in October 2014 in a campaign against British Labour politician Luciana Berger, a Jewish Member of Parliament. A member of neo-Nazi group National Action had been sent to prison for sending her abusive messages over Twitter and \"The Daily Stormer\" encouraged its readers to send her antisemitic messages, as long as they did not promote violence. It also gave out guidelines on how to limit traceability and create anonymous e-mail and Twitter accounts. Berger said she received 400 abusive messages in one week. The abuse was brought up in the British Parliament, where Speaker John Bercow deemed it \"beneath contempt\". The Troll Army launched a campaign in February 2015 against Mariam Veiszadeh, an Afghan Australian Muslim activist who demanded that a T-shirt bearing the Australian flag reading \"If you don't love it, leave\" be withdrawn from sale at Woolworths. A woman was arrested for sending her abusive messages, and Anglin interpreted Veiszadeh's actions as curbing freedom of speech, which he believed \"should be responded to with the most ridiculous conceivable hateful speech\".\n\nThe \"Troll Army\" has also attacked right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for having a Jewish wife and not being anti-Semitic. In November 2015, they took part in \"Operation: Kikebart\", targeting conservative news website Breitbart News for opening an office in Israel. The aim was to post so much anti-Semitic content in the comments section that it would be unfeasible to moderate. Disqus, the comment platform used by websites including Breitbart, ended its service to \"The Daily Stormer\" as a result. In 2016, \"The Daily Stormer\" took part in a Gamergate-related attempt to have Nintendo marketing officer Alison Rapp fired; Nintendo dismissed her and stated that it was unrelated to the controversy. Later that year, the site encouraged racially abusing Julia Ioffe, a Russian-Jewish journalist who had written a piece on Trump's wife, Melania Trump, in \"GQ\" magazine. Melania Trump and \"The Daily Stormer\" both found the piece too critical. Ioffe said that the abuse was unparalleled in her lifetime since leaving Russia to escape such prejudices 26 years earlier. In June, users of the website revealed the personal details of Erin Schrode, a Jewish woman running for Congress in California, and sent her Holocaust-related messages.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center has opened a lawsuit against \"The Daily Stormer\" alleging it had invaded the privacy and caused \"intentional infliction of emotional distress\" upon Montana Jewish resident Tanya Gersh. The website initiated a \"troll storm\" in response to Gersh's alleged extortion of property belonging to the mother of white nationalist Richard B. Spencer. Gersh denies the allegations. The site crowdfunded $152,000 in legal fees from around 2,000 contributors and hired First Amendment lawyer Marc Randazza, whose previous clients include 8chan and right-wing author Mike Cernovich. The suit ran into difficulties because of Anglin's secrecy over his location. In November, a federal judge rules that Gersh was not a public figure, that Anglin had intentionally incited his readers to harass Gersh, and that such harassment was not protected as free speech. \n\nIn August 2017, Muslim American radio presenter Dean Obeidallah sued \"The Daily Stormer\" in an Ohio federal court. Anglin had published fake images which purported to show Obeidallah celebrating the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. The lawsuits cleared a longstanding hurdle in March 2018, when U.S. Magistrate Judge Jeremiah Lynch declared that there was sufficient evidence of Anglin being domiciled in Ohio despite living abroad. In July, the court found in Obeidallah's favor, with neither Anglin nor his representatives present in court.\n\nTaylor Dumpson, the first black student body president at American University, sued Anglin in May 2018 for organizing a racist and sexist trolling campaign against her.\n\nIn 2016, \"The Daily Stormer\" and the hacker weev jointly took credit for sending copies of a racist, anti-Semitic flier to thousands of publicly accessible, Internet-connected printers throughout the country, many of them at universities. The flier urged the reader to visit the website and accompany it \"in the struggle for global white supremacy\". Anglin credited weev for the printer exploit, while one of \"The Daily Stormer\" crew composed the flier's text. On April 20 that year, Hitler's birthday, university printers in Germany were hacked to publish Nazi propaganda tracts including the website's name. That same year, \"The Daily Stormer\" expanded its activities to establish 31 \"clubs\".\n\n\"The Daily Stormer\" capitalized on the popularity of the augmented reality video game \"Pokémon Go\" in mid-2016 to distribute racist flyers to children congregating in public to play the game, with Anglin explaining that \"I have long thought that we needed to get pre-teens involved in the movement. At that age, you can really brainwash someone easily. Anyone who accepts Nazism at the age of 10 or 11 is going to be a Nazi for life.\" On May 3, 2017, one day after a deadly stabbing attack at the University of Texas, racist flyers were posted across campus with the website address for \"The Daily Stormer\", a caricature of a black person, and the line \"... around blacks ... never relax!\".\n\n\"The Daily Stormer\" helped organize the Unite the Right rally, a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia on August 11 and 12, 2017, in which a counter-protester, Heather Heyer, was killed in a vehicular ramming. Weev also called for readers of \"The Daily Stormer\" to locate and attend Heyer's funeral, calling her a \"fat skank\". Both Anglin and weev deny that Heyer died from vehicular impact, claiming instead that she was killed by a weight-related heart attack.\n\nOn August 13, the website was informed by its domain registrar GoDaddy that it had violated the terms of service by mocking Heyer, and Anglin was given 24 hours to locate a new registrar for the site. The next day it moved to Google which almost immediately cancelled its registration for violation of terms, also terminating the website's YouTube account. The following day, the website registered with Tucows, who canceled it hours later for regularly inciting violence. On August 15, it was announced by weev that the site had moved to the dark web, and that it was now only accessible via Tor, while Facebook banned links to the site and Discord banned its channel. On August 16, Cloudflare, the DNS provider and proxy service used to protect \"The Daily Stormer\" also terminated their service. Cloudflare had traditionally refused to terminate sites based on their content, but CEO Matthew Prince made an exception, posting a public announcement and explanation on the company blog. \"The Daily Stormer\" now receives DDoS protection from a content distribution network set up in March 2017, BitMitigate. The company's founder, Nick Lim, said that he found \"The Daily Stormer\" to be \"stupid\" but believed in freedom of expression. Several Twitter accounts connected with \"The Daily Stormer\" were also suspended.\n\nOn August 17, after a relocation to dailystormer.ru, the Russian media watchdog Roskomnadzor requested a shutdown of the domain. \"The Daily Stormer\" briefly returned to the clearnet with a .lol gTLD, dailystormer.lol, administered by Namecheap, but after two days, Namecheap canceled the domain. The company's CEO Richard Kirkendall stated that \"the quality and context of the material, paired with the support for violent groups and causes passes from protected free speech into incitement\", specifically quoting one published statement from \"The Daily Stormer\": \"It doesn't take a Ph.D. in mathematics to understand that White men + pride + organization = Jews being stuffed into ovens.\"\n\nThe site returned to the web as punishedstormer.com on August 24, hosted by DreamHost, whose other far-right clients include National Vanguard and the Northwest Front. Denial-of-service attacks from Anonymous caused intermittent outages for all of DreamHost's sites, including those unconnected to white supremacist ideology. Within hours of the attack, DreamHost canceled the site's accounts for violating its terms of service, saying the host had already been kicked off the site years previously and was exploiting an automated sign-up process. Days later, \"The Daily Stormer\" was available under an Albanian .al ccTLD, dailystormer.al. Within four days, it was removed by registrar Host.al for breaking their content rules. In September, \"The Daily Stormer\" was briefly registered with a .at address from Austria, but this was removed by registrar nic.at when local politicians complained. Later that month, it reappeared on a .is domain from Iceland, a country known for its freedom of speech; Anglin said that the recent collapse of the Nordic island's government meant that politicians would be distracted from affairs related to his website. Before the end of September, ISNIC pulled \"The Daily Stormer\" because Anglin refused its standard condition of disclosing his address, fearing that the information would be passed to law agencies. From September 21 to October 6, \"The Daily Stormer\" was hosted on a .cat domain, exclusively reserved for websites promoting Catalan language and culture. It exploited weakened filters after the Spanish government raided the offices of registrar Fundació puntCAT amidst a political crisis, and published several pieces in support of Catalan independence. In November 2017, \"The Daily Stormer\" was registered with a .hk domain from Hong Kong, which was revoked before the end of the month.\n\nOn November 29, 2017, the site returned to the clear web yet again with a new .red domain name, registered through GKG.net. The domain kept the website online until it was seized by the registrar. Hours after the domain was seized, the site was registered on a new .top website, through the same registrar they has previously used for .red. The .top domain lasted just until February 2, 2018, when it was taken offline by the registrar. In February 2018, \"The Daily Stormer\" registered a new domain under the .name TLD with the Chinese-based internet company Eranet International Limited.\n\nThe domain blocking by Internet providers has raised questions regarding the implications of domain registrants policing the Internet.\nThe August 21 cancellation of The Rebel Media's registration on 24 hours notice was compared to that of \"The Daily Stormer\", as both had provided coverage sympathetic to Charlottesville protesters.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation acknowledged that the companies were within their legal rights to terminate their contracts with \"The Daily Stormer\", but that the move set a dangerous precedent in which other political views including left-wing ones could be denied legal protection. Several news outlets also published editorials discussing the free speech implications of the move.\n\nAs of August 17, \"The Daily Stormer\" had returned to the dark web on the Tor network. This prompted an announcement from the Tor project team that they were \"disgusted\" by the website—but that they were powerless to intervene. \"Vice News\" noted that Stormfront remained a client of Cloudflare; also (as echoed in commentary from a new blog by Andrew Anglin) that GoDaddy remains a registrar for Celeb Jihad, which features leaked or hacked sexual videos of celebrities. The next day Stormfront's domain name was seized by Network Solutions, enforcing terms of service against \"bigotry, discrimination or hatred\". Prompted by correspondence from the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the action prevented the site, which had operated for 20 years, from reemerging under a different registrar.\n\n"}
{"id": "27732444", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27732444", "title": "The Economic Observer", "text": "The Economic Observer\n\nThe Economic Observer () is an independent, weekly simplified-character Chinese newspaper published in the People's Republic of China since April 2001. The newspaper is considered by many people to be one of the top three economic-focused newspapers in China and is well regarded for its in-depth special features and commentary.\n\nInspired by the British \"Financial Times\", as of September 2001, the Economic Observer has also been printed on salmon/peach-colored paper. Although the newspaper's editorial offices are based in Beijing, the newspaper is actually registered in Ji'nan, the capital of Shandong province.\n\nThe Economic Observer Online was relaunched in March 2007 and offers subscribers access to all the newspaper's content. However, most of the articles from each week's newspaper also appear on the website at no charge, along with web-only content, which includes commentary and op-ed pieces from guest columnists.\n\nThe newspaper's English-language website, features select translations from the weekly newspaper and the website; it also publishes original reporting and interviews.\n\nThe paper is distributed on Saturday mornings but the official publication date is printed as the following Monday.\n\nEach issue is 56 pages and sells for 5 Chinese yuan or 10 Hong Kong dollars.\n\nThe newspaper's slogan is \"rationality and constructiveness\" ().\n\nFounded in August 2000, the Economic Observer began as a small news publication dedicated to supporting China's market liberalization and reporting on socioeconomic and political events with a stated commitment to journalistic integrity. The first issue was published in April 2001 and was 24 pages. By December 2006, the newspaper had expanded to the current 56 pages.\n\nThe Economic Observer features seven regular sections: News, Nation, Market, Corporation, Automobile/Property, Observer, Lifestyle/Business Review.\n\nThe Economic Observer is considered to take a noticeably independent approach to reporting the news in China.\n\nThe newspaper also has a reputation for being \"pro-business\" and in favor of the continuation of market reforms.\n\nOn December 7, 2009, The Economic Observer was one of only two Chinese newspapers to publish a common editorial with 55 other newspaper around the world calling for action from the world leaders gathering in Copenhagen for the UN's climate change summit. The idea for a common editorial was hatched by the British newspaper The Guardian.\n\nIn March 2010, The Economic Observer published an editorial calling on representatives of China's legislature to adopt reforms to the country’s household registration system. In an unprecedented move, the editorial was also simultaneously published by 13 other Chinese newspapers.\n\nThe editorial was headlined, “\"Request for Representatives at the Two Meetings to Hasten Reform of the Household Registration System\"”\n\nA report in the \"New York Times\" said that one of the editors involved, Deputy Editor of the Economic Observer Online Zhang Hong, was removed from his position as punishment for his role in the publishing the editorial.\n\nAccording to an article on the Wall Street Journal's \"China Real Time Blog\", Zhang Hong hatched the plan to publish an editorial in collaboration with other media outlets after taking part in the Guardian's \"Copenhagen\" editorial the previous year (see above).\n\nOn July 30, 2011, a week after 40 people were killed in a high speed train collision near Wenzhou, the newspaper ignored a government censorship directive to publish an eight-page feature on the crash. The front page story was presented as a letter to 2-year old survivor Xiang Weiyi, whose parents were killed. It described two images of China, “one blossoming in the midst of the people, the other hidden in officialdom,” and pledged “to advocate and act” for the people’s rights.\n\nThe newspaper was fined and issued a warning over an inaccurate report published in June 2012 that said the Railway Ministry may be reformed.

{"id": "8287326", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8287326", "title": "The First Emperor", "text": "The First Emperor\n\nThe First Emperor is an opera in two acts with music by Tan Dun and a libretto written in English by Tan Dun and Ha Jin. The opera received its world premiere at the Metropolitan Opera at Lincoln Center in New York City on 21 December 2006, conducted by the composer with Plácido Domingo in the title role. It was broadcast live to hundreds of cinemas around the world on 13 January 2007 as part of the Met Live in HD season. The following year, EMI released this movie broadcast on DVD. The opera was a co-production between the Metropolitan Opera and the Los Angeles Opera and was described to be the most elaborate Metropolitan opera production since \"War and Peace\".\n\nThe protagonist is the real-life emperor Qin Shi Huang, who unified China with force, erected part of the Great Wall, and was buried with his terracotta army. The story of the opera is based on the Records of the Grand Historian by Sima Qian (c.145 – 90 BC) and the screenplay of \"The Emperor’s Shadow\" by Wei Lu.\n\nTan Dun was first approached by the Met in 1996 to write an opera. After seeing the film \"The Emperor's Shadow\", he settled on the theme of the First Emperor. Zhang Yimou, the production's stage director, had worked with Tan Dun on the movie \"Hero\" that also deals with emperor Qin, albeit at an earlier time. The world premiere production was estimated to cost in excess of US$2 million. In preparation, Met staff was instructed in Chinese, and workshops in the development of the opera were held in Shanghai, in part as a cost-saving measure. Eagerly anticipated, the opera has been described as \"a high-stakes, cross-cultural gamble\". Tan Dun noted in regard to working in the operatic form: \n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nThe traditional music at the court displeases the Emperor; he envisions a new anthem that glorifies his rule. He believes that his childhood friend, the composer Gao Jianli, should be the person to compose the anthem. Jianli lives in Yan, a state that the emperor has not yet conquered, and he orders his General to subjugate Yan and to get Jianli. As a reward for a victory, the Emperor promises his crippled daughter, Princess Yueyang, to the General.\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nThe General is successful, and Jianli is brought before the Emperor. Although the Emperor greets Jianli with friendship, Jianli is enraged and rejects him: his village was destroyed, and his mother was killed. He would rather die than compose an anthem for the emperor. Princess Yueyang admires his bravery.\n\n\"Scene 3\"\n\nThe Princess convinces the Emperor to hand Jianli over to her if she is able to convince him to live on and write the anthem. Jianli refuses to eat, but when the Princess feeds him from her own mouth, his resistance is broken. They make love and she loses her virginity. The Princess cries he is hurting her legs and she realises she is no longer paralysed and can walk normally. The Emperor, who is overjoyed to see her cured and calls Jianli a miracle worker, soon recognizes the cause. He wants to kill Jianli for violating his daughter, but hesitates at this point to get his anthem.\n\n\"Scene 1\"\n\nAs Jianli instructs Princess Yueyang in music, he hears the slaves sing while they build the Great Wall. The Emperor appears and demands that his daughter honor his promise of marriage to General Wang Bi. Yueyang refuses; she would rather kill herself. The Emperor schemes asking Jianli to give her up temporarily. He expects the General to be killed in battle, and Jianli would be free afterwards to have his daughter. Jianli agrees and will complete the anthem.\n\n\"Scene 2\"\n\nAt the imperial inauguration the Emperor encounters the ghost of Yueyang: she had committed suicide as she could not sacrifice her love for the benefit of the country. Next he meets the ghost of General Wang Bi telling him that he was poisoned by Jianli and warning him of Jianli’s vengeance. As the Emperor ascends towards his throne, Jianli emerges. Insane with grief about his lover’s death, he bites off his tongue and spits it out at the Emperor. The Emperor strikes him down to spare him a slow death. He moves on to his throne and now hears the anthem for the first time. It is the slaves’ song. He realizes that this is Jianli's revenge.\n\n\nNote: \"Cat:\" is short for catalogue number by the label company.\n\nThe stage director of the first production was Chinese film director Zhang Yimou. The sets were designed by Fan Yue, with choreography devised by Dou Dou Huang and costumes created by Emi Wada.\n\nUpon its premiere, the opera has received mixed reviews with some reviewers praising it for its lavish production design and performances, while others criticized it for its dullness and sheer length. \"The Guardian\" wrote \"everything is excellent apart from the music and the words...\". Despite the mixed critical reception, all of the subsequent performances through the 23 January 2007 remained sold out. One article has suggested revisions to the opera.\n\n"}

Bastianich and Lynch are both recipients of the James Beard Award.\n\nThe idea was formed when Bastianich and Edison were pondering how to pair the songs of Led Zeppelin with various wines.\n\n\"Our passion for wine is only rivaled by our passion for Zeppelin,” said Bastianich, and encouraged attendees to \"taste with their ears and listen with their mouths.\"\n\nEdison, in an interview with publishing blog Galley Cat, said, \"Either you see this as a hyper-intellectual exercise in promoting the lexicon of oenology as a valid critical system while simultaneously subverting it and subjecting it to ridicule—or you think it is just some dudes who want to drink some really good wine and listen to Led Zeppelin. No matter what, it is still going be the best salon since Dorothy Parker made that crack about horticulture.”\n\nEdison has explained that “Zep is the perfect band to pair with wine—maybe the only band. They have all the right qualities: They can be earthy and intense, or dark and mellow, or just insanely huge. They've got some very real, edgy twang, and some rich, complex textures. They embrace both the Old World and the New. I can't think of any other band that shows so much depth and development, both within individual songs and across entire records,” adding, that the wine pairings were both “freakishly sophisticated and patently absurd.”\n\nThe first Great Led Zeppelin Wine Pairing was held at Becco restaurant in New York City on March 17, 2009, and received excellent reviews and widespread media attention. The New York Post reported, “Guests at Tuesday night's first-ever Great Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting were an odd combo of wine fans and Zep heads but it didn't take many samplings for everyone to start feeling a whole lotta love.”\n\nThe menu, created by chef Billy Gallagher, featured six courses, each paired with wine and select Led Zeppelin songs, as follows:\n\n~Antipasto~\n\n“The Song Remains the Same”\n\nGrilled Calamari & Dandelion Salad with Hard-Boiled Egg\n\nChampagne 1er Cru Vertus NV, Guy Larmandier (France)\nGruner Veltliner Smaragd Terrassen 2007,\nDomane Wachan (Austria)\n\n~Primi~\n\n“Going to California”\n\nPappardelle with Wild Mushroom Ragu\n\nPinot Noir Knox Alexander 2006, Au Bon Climat (California)\n\n“Black Dog”\n\nBlack Spaghetti Arribiata with Sautéed Shrimp\n\nMalbec 2005, Tritono (Argentina)\n\n~Secondi~\n\n“Kashmir”, “Whole Lotta Love”\n\nBistecca alla Becco\n\nBlack Angus Rib-Eye Steak grilled Medium-Rare with Garlic Mashed Potatoes & Sauteed Broccoli Rabe\n\nBarolo Vigne Rionda 2000, Oddero (Italy)\n\n~Dolci~\n\n“Tangerine”\n\nFarm Fresh Tangerines\n\nMoscato d’Asti 2008, Vietti (Italy)\n\n“Custard Pie”\n\nVanilla Custard Pie & Led Zeppolini\n\nThe second Great Led Zeppelin Wine Tasting was held at City Winery in New York City and featured the Led Zeppelin Tribute band Six Foot Nurse performing live with special guest Scott Ian from the band Anthrax. More events are expected, including one in Las Vegas in May 2010. <-- did this take place? -->\n\nJoe Bastianich: “I think because of the sheer complexity and the deep roots of the music—where the music comes from, and how profound it is— Led Zeppelin's music can only really be paralleled with the kind of evolution, importance and complexity of wine, as both a cultural thing as well as a beverage.”\n\nMike Edison: “Back when I was in seminary school, attempting to pair Boones Farm apple wine with \"Stairway to Heaven\" and having disastrous results, I stumbled upon this little theory: \"Led Zeppelin IV\" is the record that when you're stoned and listening to it really loud you think the phone is ringing when it's really not. ’Black Dog’ is like a fully fucking awesome motherfucker—this is when they got really heavy.”\n\nDavid Lynch (referring to the “Black Dog” pairing): We're bringing the thunder. We're bringing the tannin. We're bringing the viscosity. We're coming at you with guns blazing, with a Malbec from Argentina.\n\n"}

His research concluded that these measures may not have been necessary.\n\nHerndon proved the paper contained multiple errors, provoking widespread international interest and embarrassment for austerity policymakers. The Reinhart-Rogoff paper was frequently cited during the 2012 U.S. presidential election campaign. It was also frequently cited among policymakers in congress, including in the drafting of the Bowles-Simpson report. However, there are differing views on the actual impact the original paper may have had on policy making.\n\nThe findings have been described as \"shocking\" and as having rocked the economics world. Publications such as \"The Washington Post\" have for several years taken the conclusions of the Reinhart-Rogoff paper as an \"economic consensus view.\" \"New York\" magazine wrote that Herndon \"just used part of his spring semester to shake the intellectual foundation of the global austerity movement.\"\n\nDuring his graduate studies in a class with Professor Michael Ash, Herndon was assigned to pick an economics paper and try to replicate the results. He chose \"Growth in a Time of Debt\", and throughout the semester his attempts to replicate the results proved unsuccessful. After further consultation with his professors Michael Ash and Robert Pollin, Herndon was encouraged to contact the authors Reinhart and Rogoff at Harvard. They provided him with the actual working spreadsheet they had used to obtain their results. Herndon looked into the detail of the original spreadsheet and found several issues:\n\n\nThe basic conclusion that countries with indebtedness rates above 90% of GDP have lower growth rates still held, but the most spectacular results disappeared, the relationship was much gentler and there were numerous exceptions to the rule. These results were published on 15 April 2013 as a draft working paper, and in 2014 in the peer-reviewed Cambridge Journal of Economics.\n\n"}
{"id": "35527034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35527034", "title": "UK miners' strike (1972)", "text": "UK miners' strike (1972)\n\nThe 1972 UK miners' strike was a major strike involving a dispute between the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the Conservative Edward Heath government over pay. It began on 9 January 1972 and ended on 28 February 1972, when the miners returned to work. The strike was called by the National Executive Committee of the NUM and ended when the miners accepted an improved pay offer in a ballot. It was the first time since 1926 that British miners had been on official strike, but there had been a widespread unofficial strike in 1969.\n\nThe strike occurred after wage negotiations between the NUM and the National Coal Board had broken down. It was the first time since 1926 that British miners had officially gone on strike (although there had been unofficial strikes). The dispute was caused by the issue of pay. In 1960, according to one study, \"miners, of whom there were still half a million in 1960, enjoyed historically unprecedented standards of living.\" According to another study, while the real net income of an average miner in 1957 with a wife and two children was approximately 22% above that of his male counterpart in manufacturing, that fell to approximately 2% below the manufacturing figure in 1969.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the wages of miners went up from a prewar position of 84th to near the top in the league table of the wages earned by industrial workers, and by 1960, miners' wages were 7.4% above the average pay of workers in manufacturing industries. During the 1960s, however, pay fell behind other workers, and by 1970 were earning 3.1% less than the average worker in manufacturing.\n\nDuring a parliamentary debate on the strike in its second week, both Labour and Conservative MPs praised the miners for the forbearance shown during the mass pit closures in the 1960s.\n\nThe National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers did not strike. Following some confrontations with NUM pickets, the National Coal Board adopted a policy of giving leave on full pay to any members of NACODS who faced aggressive intimidation on the way to work.\n\nThe strike was characterised by the use of flying pickets sent to other industrial sites to persuade other workers to strike in solidarity with the miners, which led to railway workers' refusing to transport coal and power station workers' refusing to handle coal.\n\nPower shortages emerged, and a state of emergency was declared on 9 February, after the weather had turned cold unexpectedly and voltage had been reduced across the entire national grid.\n\nA miner from Hatfield Colliery, near Doncaster, Freddie Matthews, was killed by a lorry while he was picketing on 3 February 1972, which led to a huge crowd at his funeral. The nonunionised lorry driver had mounted the pavement to pass the picket line and struck Matthews in the process. In the aftermath of the death, the picketing in the Doncaster area became more violent, with clashes reported with the NACODS members at Markham Main and Kilnhurst. That led Tom Swain, Labour MP to Derbyshire North East, to remark, \"This could be the start of another Ulster in the Yorkshire coalfield.\" He threatened to \"advocate violence\" if an immediate statement were not made on Matthews's death.\n\nThe strike lasted seven weeks and ended after miners agreed to a pay offer on 19 February. The offer came after the Battle of Saltley Gate, when around 2000 NUM pickets descended on a coke works in Birmingham and were later joined by thousands of workers from other industries in Birmingham.\n\nThe result was characterised as a \"victory for violence\" by the Conservative Cabinet at the time in reference to some clashes between miners and police and to some throwing of stones and bottles at lorries trying to pass the pickets.\n\nA volunteer force was planned in Scotland to break the miners' pickets during the strike. It has emerged, under the thirty-year rule, that civil servants, police, local authorities and other organisations worked on a secret project to gather hundreds of drivers to supply the country's power stations.\n\nA Royal Air Force base was to be used for the unit. They were to have between 400 and 600 trucks and drivers. Fire brigades were also contacted to provide off-duty staff and volunteer groups to cater for the coal convoys. The role of the volunteers was to drive in convoys to break the picketlines blocking the supply of coal to the Scottish power plants. The plans were never put into the place because the dispute was brought to a close.\n\nThe inadequacy of the Government's response to the strike provoked re-evaluation of emergency planning. The Cabinet Office Briefing Room (known as COBR) was created to coordinate responses to national and regional crises, and is still used in British Government today.\n\n\n"}

A number of these phenomena were categorised as violations of fundamental human values and norms by the Nuremberg Tribunal after the war ended. The mass movement of people – most of them refugees – has either been caused by the hostilities, or enforced by the former Axis and the Allied powers based on ideologies of race and ethnicity, culminating in the postwar border changes enacted by the international settlements. The refugee crisis created across formerly occupied territories in World War II provided the context for much of the new international refugee and global human rights architecture existing today.\n\nBelligerents on both sides engaged in forms of expulsion of people perceived as being associated with the enemy. The major location for the wartime displacements was the East-Central and Eastern Europe, although Japanese people were expelled during and after the war by Allied powers from locations in Asia including India. The Holocaust also involved deportations and expulsions of Jews aside from the subsequent genocide perpetrated by Nazi Germany under the auspices of Aktion Reinhard.\n\nFollowing the invasion of Poland in September 1939 which marked the beginning of World War II, the campaign of ethnic \"cleansing\" became the goal of military operations for the first time since the end of World War I.\n\n\n\n\nThe United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was set up in 1943, to provide humanitarian relief to the huge numbers of potential and existing refugees in areas facing Allied liberation. UNRRA provided billions of US dollars of rehabilitation aid, and helped about 8 million refugees. It ceased operations in Europe in 1947, and in Asia in 1949, upon which it ceased to exist. It was replaced in 1947 by the International Refugee Organization (IRO), which in turn evolved into United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950.\n\n\n"}
