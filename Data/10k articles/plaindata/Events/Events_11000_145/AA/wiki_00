The Russian Federation and Ukraine stated their readiness to become guarantors of the Transnistrian status observance, as well as of the Memorandum's provisions. Chişinău and Tiraspol have decided to sustain the establishment of legal and state relations: the mutual decision coordination, inclusively regarding prerogatives delimitation and delegation, the safeguard of mutual security, the Transnistrian participation in the process of accomplishment of the foreign policy of the Republic of Moldova. The memorandum also gave Transnistria the right to independently conduct foreign economic activity, although later the Memorandum provisions had widely diverging legal and political interpretations in Chişinău and Tiraspol.\n\nThe parties reaffirmed the 1992 ceasefire and requested that Russia, Ukraine and OSCE continue their mediation efforts. Both parties agreed that the Dniestr Region would have the right to unilaterally establish and maintain international contacts in the economic, scientific-technical and cultural spheres.\n\n\n"}

Support for the campaign came from a number of high-ranking officials and governments, including the United States Congress, U.S. President Barack Obama, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, U.S. Republican Party presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the Italian Parliament, the Australian Parliament, the Canadian Parliament, the German Parliament, and German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle.\n\nThe IOC declined the request for a minute of silence at the opening ceremony, but IOC officials honoured the victims at a ceremony organised by the Israeli embassy and the Jewish community in London during the Olympics on August 6, 2012. A further ceremony was planned in Germany on the anniversary of the attack on September 5, 2012 at the military airfield of Fürstenfeldbruck. IOC President Rogge led a spontaneous minute of silence during a ceremony on July 23, 2012 which promoted the Olympic truce, marking the first time ever that the IOC honored the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village.\n\nThe Munich massacre occurred during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, in southern West Germany, when members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage and eventually murdered by the Palestinian group Black September. The kidnappers killed eleven Israeli athletes and coaches, as well as a West German police officer.\n\nFollowing the attack, a memorial service was held in the Olympic Stadium, although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Avery Brundage did not refer to the athletes during his speech. Since the memorial, the IOC has repeatedly rejected calls to commemorate the victims during the Olympics or hold an official memorial service.\n\nThe families of the murdered athletes have attempted since the massacre to receive official remembrance for those killed in the massacre, starting with the Montreal Olympics in 1976.\n\nAnkie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, has helped lead the campaign, and has described the idea of a minute of silence or other form of commemoration as \"natural in our [the families'] eyes.\" However, Spitzer said,\nBut they told us very clearly: \"There are 21 Arab delegations that will leave if we say something about the Israeli athletes.\" So I said: \"Let them leave if they can't understand what the Olympics are all about – a connection between people through sport.\"\n\nSince the Montreal Olympics, the IOC has continued to reject any official commemoration of the victims. Spitzer explained that the International Olympics Committee says it is not in the \"protocol of the opening ceremony to have a commemoration.\" However, Spitzer said, \"Well, my husband coming home in a coffin was not in the protocol either. This was the blackest page in Olympic history. These 11 athletes were part of the Olympic family, they were not accidental tourists. They should be remembered as part of the Olympic framework.\"\n\nIn April 2012, the year of the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre, an online petition was created titled \"Tell the International Olympic Committee: 40 Years is Enough!\", to urge the International Olympic Committee to honour the memory of the eleven murdered athletes in one minute of silence. The Jewish Community Center of Rockland County, New York, initiated the petition with Ankie Spitzer, the wife of Andrei Spitzer, who was killed at the Munich Olympics. The petition says, \"Just one minute — at the 2012 London Summer Olympics and at every Olympic Game, to promote peace.\" When the London Olympics took place in July, over 100,000 people had signed the petition in support of one minute of silence.\n\nLater during the same month, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon wrote an official letter to the International Olympic Committee, in which he requested the commemoration of the eleven murdered athletes in a minute of silence, as well as an emphasis on the Olympic principles of equality and brotherhood. Ayalon said, \"We must remain vigilant against acts of hate and intolerance that stand in contrast to the ideals of the international Olympics.\"\n\nSupport for the one minute of silence campaign for the London 2012 Olympics emerged from across the globe. Calls for a minute of silence also came from various parliaments and government officials. In addition, over 100,000 people signed a petition in support of one minute of silence.\n\nPrime Minister Julia Gillard, Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan, Foreign Minister Bob Carr, opposition leader Tony Abbott, New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell, Victorian Premier Ted Baillieu, and federal lawmakers Michael Danby and Josh Frydenberg signed a letter urging the International Olympics Committee to hold one minute of silence. The letter said, \"Silence is a fitting tribute for the athletes who lost their lives on the Olympic stage. Silence contains no statements, assumptions or beliefs and requires no understanding of language to interpret.\"\n\nAustralian lawmakers unanimously supported a motion that supported a minute of silence during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics. Prime Minister Julia Gillard and opposition leader Tony Abbot voted for the motion as well. The motion said that the impact of 1972 Munich Massacre \"has been seared on world consciousness\" and urged the International Olympic Committee to commemorate the 40th anniversary.\n\nThe House of Commons unanimously adopted a motion by Liberal Member of Parliament Irwin Cotler to support the campaign for a special tribute for the victims of the Munich Massacre.\n\nMinister of State for Sport Bal Gosal and Minister of Foreign Affairs John Baird urged IOC President Jacques Rogge to reconsider his position against commemorating the victims. They wrote, \"The terrorist attack targeted not only Israel, but the spirit and goals of the Olympic movement. Given the impact of this tragedy, on the Olympic community as a whole and the world, it should be marked publicly as part of the official ceremony of the games, not just by the Israeli delegation.\"\n\nForeign Minister Guido Westerwelle supported a minute of silence at the London Olympics in a letter to Jacques Rogge, the president of the International Olympics Committee. Westerwelle wrote that the Munich Massacre was \"also an attack on the Olympic Games and the Olympic idea of promoting peace and friendship among the nations.\" Westerwelle recognized that the focus of the Olympics must be the sports competition, but also appealed to Rogge for \"a moment's pause at an appropriate time\" during the Olympics, which would be \"a humanitarian gesture and a fitting way to send the message that violence and terror are incompatible with the Olympic idea.\" Westerwelle added that Germany \"looks back with grief and anguish on the tragedy of Munich\" and their thoughts are with the victims, their families, and the Israeli team members who survived.\n\nParliament President Norbert Lammert pledged his support for one minute of silence in an official letter to Israel's Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin. Rivlin said, \"That Germany, on whose territory the terrorist attacks were carried out, joined the cause is extremely significant.\" \"The case for a minute of silence to mark the 40th anniversary of the massacre is a moral cause of the first order.\"\n\nThe London Assembly unanimously agreed on a motion that called on Mayor Boris Johnson to ensure that the victims of the 1972 Munich Massacre are remembered during the 2012 Games with a minute of silence in the Olympic Park during the opening or closing ceremonies. The motion said:\n\nThis Assembly notes the widespread, cross-party, support for one minute's silence during the London Olympic Games to mark the 10th Olympiad since and 40th anniversary of the terrorist massacre of Israeli competitors and their coaches during the 1972 Munich Olympics. \nThis Assembly urges the Mayor of London to use his position and influence to ensure an official minute's silence remembrance is observed in the Olympic Park during the Opening or Closing Ceremonies of the London Olympic Games.\n\nAndrew Dismore AM proposed the motion and said, \"It is 40 years since this terrible attack took place and there has not once been a memorial service or event officially part of the scheduled events at Olympic Games. This is simply not good enough. The IOC say to have a minute's silence to commemorate these victims of terrorism would be a 'political gesture' but surely not having a minute's silence is, in itself, the political gesture. This is not about the nationality of the victims – they were Olympians.\" Roger Evans AM seconded the motion and said, \"The IOC needs to show some political courage and allow the commemoration of a tragedy that affected their guests during their event in their venue forty years ago. This important decision should not be dictated by a small number of their members.\"\n\nApproximately 140 members of Italy's parliament urged the International Olympic Committee to observe one minute of silence on the 40th anniversary of the Munich Massacre in a letter they wrote to the IOC.\n\nThe United States Senate unanimously passed a resolution which urged the International Olympic Committee to hold one minute of silence. The United States House of Representatives unanimously passed a similar bill brought by the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs, but the full body did not receive a chance to vote on it. The House of Representatives held a moment of silence themselves, and one-minute speeches were given on the House floor as well. Representative Eliot Engel, who cosponsored the resolution in support of a minute of silence, blamed the IOC's refusal on \"being political because frankly they’re afraid of offending some of the Arab nations.\" However, Engel said, \"If you have this fiction of fraternal bonds and commonality of feeling, then it's appropriate for the IOC to act without any politics whatsoever. The only reason they haven’t done this in 40 years is because it's Israeli athletes, and that makes it even more disgraceful.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama said that he \"absolutely\" supports a minute of silence. National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said \"We absolutely support the campaign for a minute of silence at the Olympics to honor the Israeli athletes killed in Munich.\"\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote to the International Olympics Committee President Jacques Rogge to urge the IOC to hold an \"appropriate memorial event\" in London for the victims of the Munich massacre, and urged the IOC to reverse their decision against holding a minute of silence.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate, Governor Mitt Romney, supported one minute of silence. Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mitt Romney, said, \"Governor Romney supports the moment of silence in remembrance of the Israeli athletes killed in the Munich Olympic Games.\"\n\nThe International Olympic Committee refused to hold one minute of silence at the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre. IOC President Jacques Rogge said that, \"We feel that the opening ceremony is an atmosphere that is not fit to remember such a tragic incident.\" However, Rogge said that the IOC would honour the victims of the Munich massacre at a reception in London during the Olympics on August 6, and that IOC officials would attend a ceremony in Germany on the anniversary of the attack on September 5 at the military airfield of Fürstenfeldbruck, where most of the Israelis died during a botched rescue attempt. Rogge also said that he has attended several ceremonies with the Israeli Olympic Committee and Israeli athletes during recent games.\n\nDespite the refusal to honour the victims during the opening ceremony of the Olympics, on July 23 IOC President Jacques Rogge led a minute of silence during a ceremony which promoted the Olympic truce. This was the first time that the IOC honoured the Israeli victims in a ceremony inside an Olympic village. Rogge started by \"honoring the memory of the 11 Israeli Olympians who shared the ideals that have brought us together in this beautiful Olympic village\" and said that the Israelis \"came to Munich in the spirit of peace and solidarity.\" Rogge added, \"we owe it to them to keep that spirit alive and to remember them.\" In response to Rogge's spontaneous minute of silence, Ilana Romano, the widow of Israeli weightlifter Yossef Romano, said, \"He is trying to do the bare minimum,\" and called it \"shameful.\" Ankie Spitzer, the widow of Israeli coach Andrei Spitzer, also criticized Rogge, saying, \"This is not the right solution, to hold some ceremony in front of 30 or 40 people. We asked for a moment of silence at the opening ceremony, not for someone to mumble something in front of a few dozen people.\" At the London commemoration on August 6, Romano told Rogge he had \"submitted to terrorism\", and would be \"written down on the pages of history as ... a president who violated the Olympic charter calls for brotherhood, friendship and peace.\" Their attacks were applauded by the audience, but afterwards some attendees privately expressed discomfort at the sustained attack on Rogge, and Andrew Gilbert, formerly chair of Limmud International tweeted that \"the memorial service for Munich 11 became an anti-IOC rally and heavy-handed humiliation of Rogge\".'\n\nJibril Rajoub, the president of the Palestine Olympic Committee, thanked Jacques Rogge in a letter for refusing to hold a minute of silence, saying that it promotes the \"spread of racism\" and that the Palestinian Olympic team was prepared to \"confront the Israeli provocations,\" referring to a minute of silence. Rajoub added that \"sport in Palestine is a means to achieve national goals\" as well as \"a tool of struggle to present the Palestinian cause,\" and that \"sports are a bridge to love, interconnection, and spreading of peace among nations.\" \"Al-Hayat al-Jadida\", the official daily newspaper of the Palestinian National Authority referred to the Munich massacre as \"the Munich Operation.\" Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon denounced the use of the term \"racist\" by Rajoub, and insisted that the murder of the Israeli Olympians due to their nationality was the racist act.\n\nAnkie Spitzer and Ilana Romano urged members of the crowd to stand for a spontaneous minute of silence during the opening ceremony. Spitzer claimed that Rogge was using a Munich ceremony organised by the Israelis and the London Jewish community on August 6 as an excuse not to hold the moment of silence. Spitzer said, \"Jacques Rogge is using it as a hideaway. If the Israeli embassy and London Jewish community were not organizing it, he would not have any memorial to go to.\"\n\nWhen the Israeli delegation entered the Olympic Stadium, NBC sportscaster Bob Costas noted that the International Olympic Committee denied the requests for a minute of silence, saying in an interview that \"many people find that denial more than puzzling but insensitive.\" During the opening ceremony, Costas referred to the spontaneous minute of silence the week before as insufficient, saying, \"Still, for many, tonight with the world watching is the true time and place to remember those who were lost and how and why they died.\"\n\nCongressman Eliot Engel condemned the IOC's refusal, saying, \"Shame on you!\" Joseph Potasnik, vice president of the New York board of rabbis, said, \"37,360: these are the number of minutes in the entire Olympics and they didn't find one.\"\n\nBarbara Berger, whose brother David Mark Berger was killed in the Munich massacre, felt dismayed and offended at the rejection, explaining that \"A moment of silence may not seem like much. But to us, to the families who lost so much, that silent respect will speak volumes.\" Such a moment:\n\nAly Raisman, a Jewish-American gymnast who won a gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics, expressed her support for a minute of silence at the Olympics, saying that, \"The fact it was on the 40th anniversary is special, and winning the gold today means a lot to me. If there had been a moment's silence, I would have supported it and respected it.\"\n\nOn August 9, Irwin Cotler, a former Canadian justice minister and attorney-general and a then-member of Parliament, wrote a last-minute plea to Rogge to hold a minute of silence at the closing ceremony of the Olympics. Cotler wrote:\n\nCotler said that the IOC's \"steadfast reluctance\" to hold a minute of silence ignores and mocks \"the calls for a moment of silence by Government leaders... and the sustained international public campaign and anguished civil society appeals.\" Cotler also mentioned that such a memorial would not be unprecedented, mentioning the minute of silence observed in memory of the Georgian athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili in the 2010 Winter Olympics; the 2002 Winter Olympics' memorialization of the victims of 9/11; and the 2012 Summer Olympics' memorialization of the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings, which happened the day after London was awarded the games. Cotler noted that neither of the last two terrorist attacks he mentioned were connected to the Olympics.\n\nOn July 25, 2012, the Italian Chamber of Deputies held a minute of silence to mark the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre and in honour of the victims of the massacre. On July 29, members of the Italian Olympic delegation also held a moment of silence. Those in attendance consisted of approximately 30 individuals, as well as the Italian Tourism and Sports Minister Piero Gnudi, the head of the Italian Olympic Committee Gianni Petrucci, the Chairman of the Israeli Olympic Committee Zvi Varshaviak, and the head of the Israeli delegation Efraim Zinger.\n\nOn July 27, 2012, over 20,000 people throughout London attended a \"Minute for Munich\" program organised by the British Zionist Federation. On the same day, a memorial was held in Trafalgar Square that was attended by approximately 400 people to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Munich massacre. The event, organised by the British Israel Coalition, was \"a response to the International Olympic Committee's sustained refusal to include a minute of silence in the opening ceremony due to be held tonight.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister David Cameron agreed to attend a commemoration at Guildhall to mark the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre and in honour of the victims of the massacre. Prime Minister Cameron said, \"It's right that in 2012 – 40 years on from the Munich Olympics – we remember the Israeli team members who were killed there.\"\n\nIsraelis marked the 40th anniversary of the Munich massacre in London, during which prayers were read for the 11 murdered Israelis, wreaths were laid, and a plaque was unveiled approximately four miles from the Olympic Stadium. London Mayor Boris Johnson attended the event, and recalled watching the massacre in 1972 unfold when he was 8 years old. Johnson said, \"What sticks in my mind is that sense of sacrilege and a feeling of horror that the world's greatest sporting event should suffer such an attack, and that an attack should be mounted against people who had been training for what should have been the greatest event in their lives. And I think the world watched with a sense of numb disbelief as those events unfolded because sport should transcend politics.\" In addition, Israeli TV commentators held an informal 30-second silence during the Olympics opening ceremony.\n\nOn July 31, a minute of silence was held aboard an EasyJet flight from London to Israel as their airplane flew over Munich, Germany. The captain of the flight agreed to a request from the passengers to hold a minute of silence, and asked passengers to do so.\n\nA memorial ceremony was held on August 6, organised by the National Olympic Committee of Israel, the embassy of Israel in London, and the Jewish Committee for the London Games. IOC president Jacques Rogge, British Prime Minister David Cameron, London mayor Boris Johnson, Israeli Sports and Culture Minister Limor Livnat and other representatives attended the ceremony. A message of support was read from Charles, the Prince of Wales. Prime Minister Cameron said:\nIt is right that we should stop and remember the 11 Israeli athletes who so tragically lost their lives when those values came under attack in Munich 40 years ago. It was a truly shocking act of evil. A crime against the Jewish people. A crime against humanity. A crime the world must never forget.\n\nCameron also recalled the 7 July 2005 London bombings, and that Britain too had suffered from terrorism. Livnat said that \"not observing a silence grants a moral victory to the evil.\" Ankie Spitzer said \"Is the IOC only interested in power and money and politics? Did they forget that they are supposed to promote peace, brotherhood and fair play?\" Spitzer and Ilana Romana, who had previously requested that Rogge be banned from the ceremony, said that the IOC had discriminated against the dead athletes because they were Israelis and Jews. They added that they were personally hurt and felt insulted by Rogge. Spitzer exclaimed, \"Shame on you!\" in reference to IOC President Rogge for refusing to hold one minute of silence.\n\nUS gymnast and gold medal winner at the 2012 London Olympics, Aly Raisman, who won her gold on the floor exercise to the music of Hava Nagila, while the music was not chosen specifically with the Munich 11 in mind, she said she would have supported and respected a moment of silence in tribute.\n\nAt the JCC Maccabi Games opening ceremonies at the JCC Rockland in suburban New York, Ankie Spitzer will lead a livestreamed, worldwide minute of silence to honour the 11 Israeli athletes who were killed in the Munich massacre.\n\n"}

The first year featured a series of chamber music concerts with eclectic programs ranging from the Baroque to rock music. Highlights included a brass quintet version of Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, a rare Morton Feldman film score, and a concert of guerrilla electronic music.\n\n\"ARTSaha! 2005\" featured a production of Bach's \"Musical Offering\" where four ensembles performed the work simultaneously and the audience was able to create their own arrangement by moving between rooms.

Of the 96 BBC employees making over this threshold, 62 were men and 34 were women, and of the seven highest earners, all were men. The disclosure prompted criticism of the BBC over the gender pay gap; other critics also criticised a lack of ethnic diversity among the highest-earning BBC personalities. Some commentators, however, argued that the mandatory disclosures were an effort by Theresa May's government to undermine the BBC.\n\nEarly in January 2018, it was announced that Carrie Gracie, the BBC's China editor, had resigned from the role because of the salary gender disparity. A pre-broadcast conversation between \"Today\" presenter John Humphrys and Jon Sopel, the BBC's North America editor, was leaked a few days later. Humphrys was recorded joking about the disparity. BBC management itself was said to be \"deeply unimpressed\" with Humphrys comments. Because of the BBC's impartiality rules, \"Woman's Hour\" presenter Jane Garvey, a prominent advocate of equal pay at the BBC, was unable to conduct an interview with Gracie on the programme, while \"You and Yours\" presenter Winifred Robinson was briefly taken off-air for tweeting her support for Gracie. More than a fortnight later, it was reported Conservative Culture minister Tracey Crouch, and other female MPs, have refused to be interviewed by Humphrys in response to his comments about Gracie's resignation. Although reported by Anushka Asthana, co-political editor of \"The Guardian\", and other media sources, Crouch has not commented about the issue.\n\nIt became known on 26 January 2018 that some of the BBC's leading male presenters would take a pay cut. According to the BBC's media editor Amol Rajan, Huw Edwards, John Humphrys, Nick Robinson, Jon Sopel and Jeremy Vine, have agreed to a salary reduction. Nicky Campbell, radio 5 live presenter, also told his listeners that he would be taking a pay cut. An independent audit investigating equal pay at the BBC is due shortly.\n"}
{"id": "26538742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26538742", "title": "Boekenweek", "text": "Boekenweek\n\nIn the Netherlands, the Boekenweek (; English: Book Week) is an annual \"week\" of ten days dedicated to Dutch literature. It has been held in March annually since 1932. Each Boekenweek has a theme. The beginning of the Boekenweek is marked by the \"Boekenbal\" (\"book ball\"), a gathering that is attended by writers and publishers. Events are held across the country during the Boekenweek, such as book signing sessions, literary festivals and debates.\n\nEach year a well-known writer, usually Dutch or Flemish, is asked to write a book, usually a novella, called the \"Boekenweekgeschenk\" (\"book week gift\"), which is to be given away during the festival. Book shops give a copy of the Boekenweekgeschenk when a customer buys a book in the Dutch language; libraries also give copies of these books when a new person becomes a member. The Boekenweekgeschenk is published by the Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek (\"CPNB\", \"Collective Promotion for the Dutch Book\"). Some authors invited to write for this event have included Maarten 't Hart (1984), Hugo Claus (1989), Cees Nooteboom, and Harry Mulisch (2000). In 2001, the Boekenweekgeschenk was originally written in English by Salman Rushdie and later translated into Dutch.\n\nIn the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the Boekenweekgeschenk was sometimes published anonymously, with a list of possible authors inside the book. As a competition, readers could submit their guess by postcard as to who the author was. Since 2002, the Boekenweekgeschenk can be used as a ticket to travel for free by train with the Nederlandse Spoorwegen on Sunday in the Boekenweek.\n\nSince 1987, an essay, the \"Boekenweekessay,\" has been written in addition to the Boekenweekgeschenk. The Boekenweekessay can be purchased in book shops. Some authors include Jan Wolkers (1995), Gerrit Komrij (1997) and Adriaan van Dis (2004).\n\nThe curriculum vitae of the author of the Boekenweekgeschenk – called the \"Boekenweek-cv\" – is distributed by public libraries among their members.\n\nOn 15 November 1930, the \"Dag van het Boek\" (\"Day of the Book\") was held to protect books from new media, such as radio and cinema. The book \"De uitgever en zijn bedrijf\" by Johan Tersteeg was published to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Nederlandsche Uitgeversbond. Publishers, booksellers and others interested in supporting books organized a longer event to promote Dutch literature.\n\nIn 1932, the first Boekenweek was held and the first Boekenweekgeschenk was published. During World War II, the Boekenweek was not held in the years 1942 till 1945. In 1941, a Boekenweekgeschenk was published but it was withdrawn from the stores due to German occupation of the country.\n\nDespite competition from other media, including new technology since 1932, the Boekenweekgeschenk has grown in popularity over the years. In 2010, during the 75th Boekenweek, 958.000 copies of the Boekenweekgeschenk were produced.\n\nThe Boekenbal (\"book ball\") is an invitation-only event, with the Collectieve Propaganda van het Nederlandse Boek (CPNB) deciding the guest list. It is traditionally held in the Stadsschouwburg in Amsterdam. The invitation policy of CPNB has sparked some controversy, and another group has organized the independent event called the \"Bal der Geweigerden\" (\"ball of the refused\"). It was first held in 2002 in Paradiso, which is nearby the location of the official Boekenbal, and it can be attended by anyone.\n\nSince 1955, a book week for children has been held, called the \"Kinderboekenweek\". It is held in October and it also lasts ten days. It opens with a social gathering, called the \"Kinderboekenbal\". Similar to the Boekenweek, a \"Kinderboekenweekgeschenk\" is written and published to be given away by book shops to clients purchasing literature for children. Some of the authors include Paul Biegel (1977), Annie M.G. Schmidt (1990) and Thea Beckman (1991). Since 1986, a picture book is published for toddlers.\n\n"}

The cemetery formerly contained the remains of 437 Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers but these were all repatriated in March 2014.\n\nThe cemetery was established in July 1996 as a centralized burial place for the remains of Korean People's Army and People's Volunteer Army soldiers recovered from battlefield exhumations across South Korea and for North Korean agents killed in South Korea since the end of the Korean War.\n\nNorth Korea has refused to accept the repatriation of the remains of its personnel on the basis that North Korea claims sovereignty over all of Korea and the soldiers accordingly are already buried on Korean soil. Also, the acceptance of the bodies of agents would amount to acknowledgment of espionage operations denied by North Korea. \n\nThe graves are in the form of traditional Korean burial mounds with plain wooden markers facing north towards North Korea (approximately 5 kilometers away). The majority of the graves are marked 무명 (Pronunciation: mumyeong= Korean word: meaning = anonymous), while those of North Korean agents are marked with 간첩 (Pronunciation: gancheop = Korean word: meaning= spy) followed by the name if known. The cemetery receives few visitors because the South Korean intelligence services monitored the site to detect North Korean sympathizers, though the services say they no longer monitor the site.\n\nSouth Korea had previously returned the remains of Chinese soldiers to North Korea through the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission which then repatriated them to China. From 1981 to 1989, 42 sets of remains were returned in this manner, however in 1997, North Korea refused to accept any further Chinese remains. Following a visit by South Korean President Park Geun-hye to Beijing in June 2013, it was agreed that the remains of the Chinese soldiers would be repatriated directly to China. The exhumation of the remains started in December 2013 and on 17 March 2014, the repatriation of the remains of the 437 Chinese soldiers took place. 55 of the sets of remains were identified while the rest were unknowns. The remains are to be interred in the Resist America and Aid Korea Martyrs Cemetery in Shenyang, China.\n\nRenovation plans for the cemetery were considered in 2012, but they met with opposition in South Korea and were not carried out.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47321438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47321438", "title": "Corey Lewandowski", "text": "Corey Lewandowski\n\nCorey R. Lewandowski (; born September 18, 1973) is an American political operative, lobbyist and political commentator. He was a political commentator for One America News Network (OANN), Fox News and CNN, as well as a campaign manager of Donald Trump's 2016 campaign for President of the United States from January 2015 to June 2016.\n\nPrior to joining Trump's campaign, Lewandowski worked on several campaigns, worked for the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity and was a lobbyist. Lewandowski himself has run unsuccessfully for office twice, once in Massachusetts and once in New Hampshire. On December 21, 2016, Lewandowski co-founded Avenue Strategies, a lobbying firm in an office overlooking the White House. He left the firm in May 2017.\n\nLewandowski was raised in Lowell, Massachusetts. One of his grandfathers was a printer. He is of Polish and French-Canadian descent. Lewandowski graduated in 1991 from Lowell Catholic High School, a private, not-for-profit, college-preparatory school in Lowell.\n\nIn 1995, he graduated from the University of Massachusetts at Lowell with a B.A. in political science. He received a master's degree in political science from American University in Washington, DC, in 1997.\n\nIn 1994, while an undergraduate student, Lewandowski ran for a seat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives as a write-in candidate in the Republican primary. He received 143 votes, falling short of the 150 votes needed to win the party's nomination for the ballot. In the November general election, the seat was won by Thomas A. Golden Jr., a Democrat. Golden received 7,157 votes, while Lewandowski received 7 votes.\n\nAfter graduating from college, Lewandowski worked as an aide for Republican Massachusetts Congressman Peter G. Torkildsen from January 1996 to January 1997, while a graduate student at American University. Also while a student in 1997, Lewandowski interned for Massachusetts State Senator Steven C. Panagiotakos, a Democrat.\n\nFrom December 1997 to February 2001, Lewandowski worked as an administrative assistant for Ohio Republican Bob Ney, a U.S. Congressman. In 2007, before Ney was sentenced on federal corruption charges arising from the Abramoff lobbying scandal, Lewandowski wrote a letter to the presiding judge, saying that Ney was a mentor and \"surrogate father\" to him and asking for leniency in sentencing.\n\nIn 1999, while working for Ney, Lewandowski brought a loaded handgun in a laundry bag into the Longworth House Office Building. He was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor. Lewandowski said it was an accident, that he forgot the gun was in the bag when he put the laundry in it. The charges eventually were dismissed; Lewandowski then unsuccessfully fought for four years to get the gun back, filing lawsuits in multiple District of Columbia and federal courts.\n\nAfter leaving Ney's office, Lewandowski worked most of 2001 for the Republican National Committee as the Northeast legislative political director.\n\nLewandowski was the campaign manager for the 2002 re-election campaign of U.S. Senator Robert C. Smith of New Hampshire. Smith was challenged in the Republican primary by John E. Sununu.\n\nSpeaking about Sununu, Lewandowski said, \"The people of New Hampshire want someone in the U.S. Senate with clear, concise views on terrorism. They'll judge a congressman based on the people he associates with, his voting record and his campaign contributions.\" Lewandowski told a reporter he would be interested to know whether anyone associated with Hamas had attended a fundraising event for Sununu. (Lewandowski cited contributions made by Washington lawyer George Salem to Sununu; Salem, who chaired Arab Americans for Bush-Cheney during the 2000 Bush/Cheney campaign, was the attorney for the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, which had its assets frozen by the U.S. government in 2001 on suspicion of ties to Hamas.) Lewandowski's comments were interpreted as publicly suggesting that Sununu, who is of Lebanese descent, had divided loyalties in fighting terrorism.\n\nFormer New Hampshire Governor Steve Merrill said, \"The politics of ethnic slurs and bigotry have no place in any campaign.\" Former New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman said, \"Bob Smith is a better human being than that, and he ought to tell his people to watch themselves.\" President George W. Bush's spokesperson said, \"The White House called Senator Smith's office ... Remarks that paint Arab Americans with a broad brush aren't helpful. We need to reassure Arab Americans that this war is about al-Qaida, not Islam. Mr. Salem is a good friend of the president's and an honorable man.\"\n\nSmith's press secretary said Lewandowski was \"merely responding to media inquiries\" about Salem's fund raising and that \"Senator Smith has repeatedly said this campaign is about records—Congressman Sununu's record and Senator Smith's record. Someone's ethnic background has absolutely nothing to do with this election.\"\n\nSununu defeated Smith in the Republican primary, winning 53% of the vote to Smith's 45%. Smith was the first sitting U.S. senator in ten years to lose a primary campaign.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2004, Lewandowski was executive director of the New England Seafood Producers Association.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2012, Lewandowski worked for Schwartz MSL, a strategic communication and engagement firm where, according to his LinkedIn profile, he served as director of public affairs from September 2004 until July 2012. Lewandowski was registered as a lobbyist for Schwartz MSL on behalf of Passport Systems in 2011, lobbying on homeland security issues. Schwartz represented Passport Systems for six years, and the firm paid Schwartz more than $350,000 over that period. Between 2008 and 2011, Passport Systems secured more than $23.9 million in federal funds. Lewandowski represented two other clients: health care software company Logical Images and solar-power company Borrego Solar.\n\nLewandowski graduated from the New Hampshire police academy in 2006 and worked from 2006 to 2010 as a seasonal marine patrol officer trainee with the New Hampshire State Police.\n\nIn 2008, Lewandowski began working for Americans for Prosperity, a Koch brothers-backed advocacy group. Lewandowski's period working for Americans for Prosperity overlapped with his tenure as a marine patrol officer trainee and registered federal lobbyist. Lewandowski was Americans for Prosperity's New Hampshire director, and East Coast regional director before becoming the national director of voter registration, a position he held until January 2015. Lewandowski's term at Americans for Prosperity was described by \"Politico\" as \"tumultuous\" and marked by \"fiery confrontations\" with other AFP employees.\n\nWhile working for Americans for Prosperity, Lewandowski criticized the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a cap-and-trade system for state utilities, saying \"it does nothing to reduce greenhouse gases because jobs and businesses just move to other states.\" At the same time, Lewandowski lobbied for Borrego Solar, helping to secure a $500,000 earmark in the 2010 Energy and Water Appropriations Act that benefited a solar electricity project in Lancaster, Massachusetts, that Borrego was involved in. \"Newsweek\" noted, \"though he had succeeded as a pro-solar lobbyist looking for government assistance, at AFP he waged a campaign against government programs that supported green energy.\"\n\nIn 2012, while still working for Americans for Prosperity, Lewandowski unsuccessfully ran for town treasurer of Windham, New Hampshire. NPR reported that during the campaign, Lewandowski \"upended the town's politics, using public records laws to probe local government and launching robocalls targeted at voters to stoke outrage over a visit to the town by President Obama.\" Robert Skinner defeated Lewandowski, receiving 1,941 votes to Lewandowski's 714.\n\nLewandowski first met Trump in April 2014 at a political event in New Hampshire. In January 2015, six months before Trump announced his campaign, Lewandowski was invited to Trump Tower, where he accepted an offer from Trump to become campaign manager. His salary was $20,000 per month.\n\nWhen Lewandowski was hired, Trump's political staff consisted of three people: his lawyer Michael D. Cohen, veteran operative Roger Stone, and aide Sam Nunberg. In April 2016, another veteran GOP operative, Paul Manafort, was hired; the following month Manafort was named “campaign chairman.” Nunberg was fired in early August 2015; he believes that it was Lewandowski and campaign press secretary Hope Hicks who asked Trump for his ouster. Stone left the campaign a week later.\n\nLewandowski's motto as Trump's campaign manager was \"Let Trump be Trump\"; those words appeared on his office white board. Trump said of Lewandowski, \"He leaves me alone, but he knows when to make his presence felt.\"\n\nLewandowski was identified in the George Papadopoulos court documents as the \"High-Ranking Campaign Official\".\n\nAfter a win in New Hampshire on February 9, 2016, Trump acknowledged Lewandowski's role in the win by praising his ground game.\n\nOn March 10, 2016, Michelle Fields, a reporter for Breitbart News, wrote that, after she asked Donald Trump a question when she approached him after a March 8, 2016, press conference in Jupiter, Florida, she was forcefully grabbed by Lewandowski. On March 29, Lewandowski was charged with one count of simple battery by the Jupiter Police Department and surrendered himself to the authorities, after releasing a statement maintaining his innocence.\n\nTwo weeks later, Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg said that his office would not prosecute Lewandowski; they believed that \"there was probable cause to make an arrest\" and \"the facts support the allegation that Mr. Lewandowski did grab Ms. Fields' arm against her will,\" but \"the evidence cannot prove all legally required elements of the crime alleged and is insufficient to support a criminal prosecution.\"\n\nOn March 19, 2016, during a campaign event in Tucson, Arizona, Lewandowski drew criticism for his handling of a protester. Although a video showed Lewandowski grabbing the protester by the collar, the campaign and Lewandowski denied doing so.\n\nIn April 2016, Lewandowski's influence within the Trump campaign was reported to be waning.\n\nOn June 20, 2016, Trump's campaign announced that it was parting ways with Lewandowski; according to reports, Lewandowski was fired, although Donald Trump Jr., Trump's son, described the split as \"amicable.\" The move occurred after Lewandowski clashed with Trump chief strategist and campaign chairman Paul Manafort in an internal \"power struggle.\" After Lewandowski's departure, Manafort (who had been brought on the campaign in March 2016) became the \"de facto\" campaign manager.\n\nDays after Lewandowski left the Trump campaign, he was hired by the cable news network CNN as a political commentator. Lewandowski remains subject to a non-disclosure agreement that he signed with Trump, forbidding him \"from making disparaging or revealing remarks about the candidate.\" Lewandowski received severance pay from the Trump campaign while working for CNN. In July 2016, after the group Media Matters for America noted that CNN had not disclosed this to viewers, CNN hosts began making on-air disclosures of the severance payments before Lewandowski's appearances.\n\nIn July 2016, Lewandowski defended Trump who had been criticized after tweeting a graphic that labeled Hillary Clinton the \"most corrupt candidate\" alongside a pile of cash and a six-pointed star evoking the Star of David. (The image originated on an Internet message board featuring antisemitic conspiracy theories). During an appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union\" with Brianna Keilar, Lewandowski denied allegations of antisemitism and said that criticism of the tweet was \"political correctness run amok.\"\n\nIn an August 2016 appearance on CNN, Lewandowski espoused the \"birther\" conspiracy theory, suggesting that President Barack Obama was not a natural-born-citizen of the United States. Lewandowski's statement was criticized by the other panelists, Angela Rye and Bakari Sellers.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, Lewandowski resigned as a CNN commentator amid speculations that he would play a role in the Trump administration.\n\nAfter leaving CNN, Lewandowski worked as a political commentator for the cable news television channel One America News Network (OANN). While he mainly worked for OANN, he made sporadic appearances on Fox News. Lewandowski was fired from OANN on July 31, 2017, for appearing on news networks outside of OANN.\n\nOn December 21, 2016, Lewandowski and Barry Bennett, a \"former Trump senior adviser\", whom Lewandowski had known for ten years, co-founded as equal partners a political consulting firm called Avenue Strategies. They were joined by other Trump presidential campaign veterans. Bennett, Mike Rubino, Jason Osborne, and most of Lewandowski's associates at Avenue Strategies filed lobbying registrations.\n\nMainly because of Lewandowski, Avenue Strategies soon became one of \"the highest-profile government-affairs outfits in Washington\". Avenue Strategies' office \"overlooks the White House\", and Lewandowski has \"relatively unimpeded access\" to President Trump either by phone or in person at the White House. Access to President Trump can be \"highly lucrative\" — \"relatively few established K Street powerhouses have ties to the new president\".\n\nIn February 2017, Avenue Strategies \"quietly agreed\" to lobby for Citgo Petroleum Corporation (Citgo). In April they signed a $25,000 a month contract as tensions mounted between the United States, Venezuela, and Russia. Citgo is headquartered in Houston, Texas, but is owned by the government of Venezuela. Citgo took out a loan from Russian state-owned oil giant, Rosneft in December 2016 that it has been unable to pay. It is under threat of a takeover by Rosneft. By early May the legally required paperwork had not been filed revealing the contract to the U.S. Government through the Senate Office of Public Records.\n\nThe governor of debt-ridden Puerto Rico hired Avenue Strategies to lobby Congress for funding. Avenue Strategies also \"operates a fledgling super PAC to help Trump win re-election\".\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", the firm's corporate clients — Fortune 100 companies — hire them as insurance against \"tweet risk\". Bennett said, \"If he’s gonna come after you, there’s nothing we can do to stop it. But if you want to figure out how to win in this environment, we can help you. [For example], [c]all Jared Kushner and tell him you’re gonna build a new factory,\" or invite Mr. Trump to \"fly somewhere, cut a ribbon, and high-five 200 employees... [That] \"drives optimism, and it drives his power. There are few things a president can do to build power faster than to lead a great economic comeback.\" Lewandowski added, \"We’re your sherpa through turbulent times.\" While at the firm, Lewandowski won a $160,000 account with Community Choice Financial, a large payday lender.\n\nLewandowski did not formally register as a lobbyist as he did not consider himself to be a lobbyist. However, he was criticized by \"competing lobbyists and ethics watchdogs\" for \"flouting the spirit of the lobbying rules, and abusing his access to the Trump White House\". On May 3, 2017, Public Citizen, a \"government-ethics group, asked the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate whether Lewandowski should have registered as a foreign or domestic lobbyist\".\n\nOn May 4, 2017, Lewandowski left Avenue Strategies.\n\nIn an article published on April 28, 2017 \"POLITICO\" revealed that they had obtained documents about Washington East West Political Strategies — an \"affiliate of Avenue Strategies\". It was one of \"several international recruitment vehicles\" through which business partners globally — including those in the Middle East, Canada, and Central America — could \"earn commissions by enlisting international clients\" for Avenue Strategies. East West solicited \"business in Eastern Europe and elsewhere by offering access to Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and other top administration officials\". ___?___ that described \"numerous proposed activities that would seem to trigger Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) registration\". East West was created by Lewandowski, Bennett, Rauf Mammadov, \"an Azerbaijani oil executive and an American political consultant who works extensively in Russia\", Marshall Comins, who \"worked extensively in the former Soviet Union and Sub-Saharan Africa consulting governments, high net-worth individuals and politicians\", Jeff Monson, a \"prominent figure in Russia’s Communist Party\", and Mike Nicholas Sango, \"Zimbabwe's ambassador to Russia.\" On May 3 Avenue Strategies dissolved East West with Bennett and Lewandowski both claiming that their collaborators, Mammadov and Comins, had issued the East West document, not them. Bennett explained that \"Avenue Strategies owned the equity — and that is me and Corey — but he didn’t have any role...[I]t is a \"violation of our understanding with them.\" Lewandowski said he had \"no affiliation or involvement\" and \"never entered into any agreement with [East West].\"\n\nOn May 12, 2017, eight days after leaving Avenue Strategies, Lewandowski incorporated Lewandowski Strategic Advisors in Delaware, which, as an advisory firm, does not register as a lobbyist or disclose its clients. He then sought to recruit David Bossie and George Gigicos.\n\nIn July 2017, Community Choice Financial, a payday lender, offered Lewandowski a $20,000-a-month retainer. On the July 30, 2017 episode of \"Meet the Press\", Lewandowski told President Trump to fire Richard Cordray, the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau; Cordray had led efforts to enact new payday lending regulations. When Chuck Todd then asked Lewandowski if he was advocating for a client, Lewandowski replied \"No, No. I have no clients whatsoever\".\n\nLewandoski was reported to be working as a lobbyist for Turnberry Solutions LLC, though he denied having any involvement with the firm.\n\nIn December 2017, the memoir \"Let Trump Be Trump\", co-authored by Lewandowski and David Bossie, was published by Center Street. The memoir chronicles Lewandowski's and Bossie's experiences working for Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nOn June 19, 2018, Lewandowski appeared on Fox News alongside Democratic strategist Zac Petkanas. When Petkanas mentioned a case of a 10-year-old immigrant girl with Down syndrome who had been forcibly taken away from her mother under the Trump administration family separation policy and put in a cage, Lewandowski responded \"womp, womp\" (an onomatopoeia for the \"sad trombone\" sound effect that often accompanies a comedic failure), which angered Petkanas and received widespread criticism from various sources. Former Fox News contributor Meghan McCain commented: \"This is so horrible, even by Lewandowski standards.\" Appearing on Fox News on June 20, Lewandowski refused to apologize for the remark and instead reiterated his belief that undocumented aliens are criminals who should be held accountable.\n\nOn June 20, 2018, Lewandowski was dropped by Leading Authorities, Inc., a speakers bureau based in Washington D.C.\n\nOn June 27, 2018, Lewandowski revisited the topic of the 10-year-old immigrant on CNN, asserting, contrary to the available evidence, that the \"10-year-old that was separated at the border was separated because her mother was a member—or a potential member—of a child-smuggling ring.”\n\nLewandowski met his future wife Alison Hardy, when he was in ninth grade and she was in eighth grade. In 1998, Hardy married Brian Kinney, but Kinney was killed on September 11, 2001 after Al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked his flight, United Airlines 175, and flew it into the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Four years later, in 2005. Lewandowski married Hardy. Together they have four children.\n\nOn November 28, 2017, a pro-Trump performer, Joy Villa, filed a police complaint against Lewandowski for allegedly slapping her buttocks at a holiday party at the Trump Hotel in Washington, D.C. Villa alleged that after she told him that she could report him for sexual harassment, Lewandowski said, \"I work in the private sector\" and slapped her again. Lewandowski responded to the allegations by saying that “There is a due process and there is a process which they will go through to determine a person’s innocence.\"\n\nLewandowski is Roman Catholic. He lives in Windham, New Hampshire, but primarily works in Manchester, New Hampshire when not in Washington, D.C.\n"}
{"id": "201153", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201153", "title": "Divide and rule", "text": "Divide and rule\n\nDivide and rule (from Latin \"dīvide et imperā\"), or divide and conquer, in politics and sociology is gaining and maintaining power by breaking up larger concentrations of power into pieces that individually have less power than the one implementing the strategy. The concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people. It was heavily used by British Empire in India and elsewhere.\n\nTraiano Boccalini cites \"divide et impera\" in \"La bilancia politica\" as a common principle in politics. The use of this technique is meant to empower the sovereign to control subjects, populations, or factions of different interests, who collectively might be able to oppose his rule. Machiavelli identifies a similar application to military strategy, advising in Book VI of \"The Art of War\" (\"Dell'arte della guerra\"), that a Captain should endeavor with every art to divide the forces of the enemy, either by making him suspicious of his men in whom he trusted, or by giving him cause that he has to separate his forces, and, because of this, become weaker.\n\nThe maxim \"divide et impera\" has been attributed to Philip II of Macedon, and together with the maxim \"divide ut regnes\" was utilised by the Roman ruler Caesar and the French emperor Napoleon.\n\nThe strategy, but not the phrase, applies in many ancient cases: the example of Gabinius exists, parting the Jewish nation into five conventions, reported by Flavius Josephus in Book I, 169-170 of \"The Wars of the Jews\" (\"De bello Judaico\"). Strabo also reports in \"Geography\", 8.7.3 that the Achaean League was gradually dissolved under the Roman possession of the whole of Macedonia, owing to them not dealing with the several states in the same way, but wishing to preserve some and to destroy others.\n\nThe strategy of division and rule has been attributed to sovereigns, ranging from Louis XI to the Habsburgs. Edward Coke denounces it in Chapter I of the Fourth Part of the \"Institutes\", reporting that when it was demanded by the Lords and Commons what might be a principal motive for them to have good success in Parliament, it was answered: \"Eritis insuperabiles, si fueritis inseparabiles. Explosum est illud diverbium: Divide, & impera, cum radix & vertex imperii in obedientium consensu rata sunt.\" [You would be insuperable if you were inseparable. This proverb, Divide and rule, has been rejected, since the root and the summit of authority are confirmed by the consent of the subjects.] On the other hand, in a minor variation, Sir Francis Bacon wrote the phrase \"separa et impera\" in a letter to James I of 15 February 1615. James Madison made this recommendation in a letter to Thomas Jefferson of 24 October 1787, which summarized the thesis of \"The Federalist#10\": \"Divide et impera, the reprobated axiom of tyranny, is under certain (some) qualifications, the only policy, by which a republic can be administered on just principles.\" In \"Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch\"\nby Immanuel Kant (1795), Appendix one, \"Divide et impera\" is the third of three political maxims, the others being \"Fac et excusa\" (Act now, and make excuses later) and \"Si fecisti, nega\" (when you commit a crime, deny it).\n\nElements of this technique involve:\n\nHistorically, this strategy was used in many different ways by empires seeking to expand their territories.\n\nThe concept is also mentioned as a strategy for market action in economics to get the most out of the players in a competitive market.\n\nA primary strategy the narcissist uses to assert control, particularly within his/her family, is to create divisions among individuals.

It is related to similar rituals used on this day at other villages, in which the dogs were whipped or beaten. The ritual is thought to have pagan origins\nand was performed in order to prevent rabies.\n\nIn dog spinning, a dog is suspended above water on a rope. The dog is turned repeatedly in a given direction to wind the rope, or is inserted into a loop of rope that has been twisted already. The dog is then released so that it spins rapidly in the opposite direction as the rope unwinds.\n\nHistorically the ritual was performed in many other parts of Bulgaria as well and although the exact practice varied regionally, e.g. whipping or beating the dogs instead of spinning them, it was performed on the same date and with the same goal. Reports of this type of ritual can be found as early as 1869.\n\nThe Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported protests at the Bulgarian Embassy in Stockholm about the cruelty of this tradition. These occurred as Bulgaria prepared to join the European Union in 2005.\n\nA reference in English is in a press release issued by the UK Green Party, issued on July 29, 2005. It includes a statement from Green Party MEP Caroline Lucas, vice-president of the RSPCA and the European Parliament's cross-party Animal Welfare Intergroup. Dr Lucas criticised it as being cruel to dogs, saying \"Dog-spinning is a barbaric practice and must not be allowed to continue into the 21st century.\"\n\nThe \"Sofia Echo\" reported the practice in March 2011.\n\nThe practice of the ritual was banned by the mayor of Tsarevo in 2006 after complaints by Bulgarian animal welfare organizations. There have been reports of the practice continuing sporadically, and animal welfare organisations have tried to ensure this does not happen.\n\n"}

Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) helps him to the school nurse's office, where Artie tells Finn he wishes that the accident that paralyzed him had never happened. Artie falls asleep in the nurse's office and enters a dream sequence. In the dream, as explained by his guide Rory Flanagan (Damian McGinty), Artie was never paralyzed and as a result many of the events as he knows them never took place. The glee club never got off the ground, and Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has become an apathetic alcoholic under the control of his wife, Terri Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig). Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is bullied by jocks – including several of the glee club members – because of his homosexuality, and as a result never graduated from high school. Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) works as a librarian in the school library, having never had a chance to be a star. Becky Jackson (Lauren Potter) is the school slut because she was never treated with respect because Artie never took her on a date. Artie gathers the glee club as he knows it and performs \"Feliz Navidad\" in an attempt to inspire them to establish a glee club, but fails. Last, Rory informs Artie that Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) never managed to recover from her car accident, which happened regardless of her participation in the glee club, and, since she didn't have the support of her friends, died of a broken heart. Rory explains to Artie that wheelchair-bound Artie is the heart and soul of the glee club, and Artie wakes up from the dream with a better appreciation of his role in the club.\n\nBurt Hummel (Mike O'Malley) surprises Kurt and Rachel by showing up at their New York apartment. Burt explains to Rachel the significance of Christmas in Kurt's life, especially after the death of Kurt's mother. Rachel goes on a cruise, while the Hummels continue to bond in New York. Burt reveals to Kurt that he has prostate cancer, but it was diagnosed at an early stage and his chances for survival are very high. Burt then surprises Kurt again by revealing that he has paid for Blaine Anderson (Darren Criss) to travel to New York to spend Christmas with them. They have an awkward but cordial reunion, and sing \"White Christmas\". Back at the apartment, Burt, Kurt, and Blaine continue several of the Hummels' Christmas traditions, and have dinner.\n\nNoah \"Puck\" Puckerman (Mark Salling) invites Jake Puckerman (Jacob Artist) to travel to Los Angeles with him.

The brothers return to Lima and later have a Hanukkah dinner at Breadstix, together with their respective mothers. The dinner goes badly at first, as the two women resent each other, but Puck and Jake convince their mothers that all four of them have a common bond: they were all placed into a difficult situation by Puck and Jake's father. The women begin to talk and soon start to bond. Puck informs Jake that he will be staying in Lima, while he works on a screenplay.\n\nBrittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) reveal to each other that they believe in the 2012 Mayan apocalypse. Believing that the world is about to end, Brittany cashes out her savings and gives her friends expensive gifts, and Sam proposes to Brittany. Coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) performs the wedding ceremony. When the apocalypse does not occur as expected, Sam and Brittany realize that they are still married, and meet Coach Beiste at Breadstix to ask for help. Beiste reveals that she is not actually qualified to perform weddings, and that they are not officially married. She did this because she didn't really want them to get married. Both Brittany and Sam are disappointed that the world didn't end, but they realized that it felt good being nice to others. Coach Beiste, feeling sorry for them, pretended that an archaeologist named Indiana Jones found a Mayan calendar predicting that the world would end on September 27, 2014. This lifted Brittany and Sam's spirits, who were delighted to find out that there was still time to tell others how they felt.\n\nAfter failing to satisfy Becky with her Christmas gifts, Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) draws Millie Rose's (Trisha Rae Stahl) name in a Secret Santa event held among the McKinley High faculty and staff. Unsure what to get Millie, Sue happens upon a conversation between Millie and her daughter Marley Rose (Melissa Benoist). Marley wants to have a Christmas tree and at least some gifts, but Millie explains that they need to save money to pay a counselor to treat Marley for her eating disorder. After seeing this, Sue breaks into the Roses' home that night and surreptitiously leaves them a Christmas tree, several presents, and enough money to pay Marley's counselor. Becky reveals to Millie that Sue was behind the surprise when bribed by candy and Millie attempts to return the money, but Sue insists that Millie keep it. Millie then brings Sue to the auditorium, where several of the glee club members including Marley sing \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\", joined in unison by the four glee clubbers singing in Breadstix and the two singing in the New York apartment.\n\nGuest star Aisha Tyler appears in this episode as the mother of Jake Puckerman.

It is claimed that RAF pilots Gary Lennox and Adrian Weeks were flying their Panavia Tornado on a bombing mission at Tallil Airfield in Iraq. Sayhood spotted them and promptly brought them down with an R-60 missile from his MiG's arsenal. Weeks and Lennox were killed in the crash of their aircraft, serial ZA467. However this aircraft is recorded as having crashed on 22 January on a mission to Ar Rutbah.\n\nSayhood continued his mission defending Iraqi airspace and came across two F-15Cs piloted by Captains Craig Underhill and Cesar Rodriguez. Underhill and Rodriguez were pursuing another pair of MiG-29s when they spotted Sayhood and his wingman. Sayhood and his wingman promptly engaged the two American aircraft and one of the most intense dogfights of the Gulf War ensued. The two MiGs and F-15s flew straight at each other, each attempting to visually identify their aggressors. Underhill faced Sayhood's wingman, while Sayhood himself faced Rodriguez. Underhill fired an AIM-7 at Sayhood's wingman, hitting him head on and killing him instantly. At the same time, Rodriguez sensed a radar lock by Sayhood, throwing him onto the defensive. Rodriguez dove down to the deck in order to confuse Sayhood's radar with ground clutter, hoping to shake the radar lock on his aircraft. After seeing his wingman killed, Sayhood briefly broke off the attack. Rodriguez and Underhill started heading south for a tanker, when Sayhood approached them from the north. Rodriguez and Underhill turned around to face Sayhood. Underhill got a radar lock on Sayhood with an AIM-7, but didn't fire because he wasn't sure if Sayhood was friendly or not. Sayhood sliced into their formation causing a \"classic merge\". Underhill climbed, keeping his lock on Sayhood, while Rodriguez stayed committed to the merge in order to visually identify the aircraft as hostile. As they passed each other, Rodriguez identified it as Iraqi, and each pilot turned left to engage the other. Sayhood was relying on the MiG's better turning radius to get onto Rodriguez's tail. They slowly spiraled towards the ground until Sayhood attempted to pull out using a split-s. Rodriguez didn't follow, and just before Sayhood could pull out, he crashed into the ground. He managed to eject from his MiG, reportedly with his crash site reportedly being merely a mile from the British jet previously shot down by him.\n\nIt was reported decades later by Iraqi sources that the Captain was rescued by some farmers after he broke his leg upon landing from his ejection and evacuated to a local hospital. Afterwards he was allegedly deemed unfit to fly, and retired from the Iraqi Air Force with a promotion to Major General.\n\nList of Gulf War pilots by victories\n"}

Baker\n\nLafayette Curry Baker (October 13, 1826 – July 3, 1868) was a United States investigator and spy, serving the Union Army, during the American Civil War and under Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.\n\nBaker was born in Stafford, New York on October 13, 1826. He became a mechanic, moved to Michigan in 1839, returned to New York in 1848, moved to California in 1853, and was a San Francisco vigilante in 1856. He moved to the District of Columbia in 1861.\n\nBaker's exploits are mainly known through his book \"A History of the Secret Service\" which he published in 1867 after his fall from grace. During the early months of the Civil War, he spied for General Winfield Scott on Confederate forces in Virginia. Despite numerous scrapes, he returned to Washington, D.C., with information that Scott evidently thought valuable enough to raise him to the rank of captain. As Provost Marshal of Washington, D.C. from September 12, 1862 to November 7, 1863, Baker ran the National Detective Bureau also sometimes known as the \"National Detective Police Department.\" He was appointed colonel of D.C. Cavalry, May 5, 1863. According to Glenn Hastedt \"Although his accomplishments were many, Baker operated with little regard for warrants or the constitutional rights of those he pursued. He is also reported to have employed brutal interrogation techniques in order to obtain information.\"\n\nBaker owed his appointment largely to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, but suspected the secretary of corruption and was eventually demoted for tapping his telegraph lines and packed off to New York.\n\nBaker was recalled to Washington after the assassination of President Lincoln in 1865. Within two days of his arrival in Washington, Baker's agents in Maryland had made four arrests and had the names of two more conspirators, including the actual presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth. Before the month was out, Booth along with David Herold were found holed up in a barn and Booth was himself shot and killed by Sgt. Boston Corbett. Baker received a generous share of the $100,000 reward offered to the person who apprehended the president's killer. President Andrew Johnson nominated Baker for appointment to the grade of brigadier general of volunteers, April 26, 1865, but the United States Senate never confirmed the appointment. Baker was mustered out of the volunteers on January 15, 1866.\n\nThe following year, Baker was sacked from his position as government spymaster. President Johnson accused him of spying on him, a charge Baker admitted in his book which he published in response. He also announced that he had had Booth's diary in his possession which was being suppressed by the Department of War and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. When the diary was eventually produced, Baker claimed that eighteen vital pages were missing. It was suggested by Otto Eisenschiml in his book, \"Why Was Lincoln Murdered?,\" that these would implicate Stanton in the assassination. However, this notion has been proven as speculation by author Edward Steers Jr. and based on non-reputable sources.\n\nOn July 3, 1868, Baker retired to home complaining of soreness from a gun wound during a hunting trip. He had been out drinking with Wally Pollack, his brother-in-law, and came home feeling sick, passing away later that night, reportedly from meningitis.\n\nA widely criticized 1977 book, \"The Lincoln Conspiracy\" by conspiracy theorists David W. Balsiger and Charles E. Sellier, alleges that Baker was poisoned by high-placed conspirators, including Stanton, who supported John Wilkes Booth's plan to kidnap Abraham Lincoln in 1864 and early 1865. The conspirators supposedly planned to have Lincoln impeached in his absence. The authors speculate that the conspirators were concerned that Baker could link them to the planned kidnapping, which might lead to accusations that they were conspirators in Lincoln's assassination. The authors believe the conspirators did not support Booth after March 1865. Academic historians have treated the book with hostility and derision, having many objections based on errors and misuse of sources in the book.\n\nBaker is buried in Forest Hills Cemetery, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\n"}
{"id": "32967282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32967282", "title": "Legends and myths regarding RMS Titanic", "text": "Legends and myths regarding RMS Titanic\n\nThere have been several legends and myths surrounding the RMS \"Titanic\" over the years. These have ranged from the myth about the ship being unsinkable, to the myth concerning the final song played by the ship's orchestra.\n\nContrary to popular mythology, \"Titanic\" was never described as \"unsinkable\", \"without qualification\", until \"after\" she sank. Three trade publications (one of which was probably never published) described \"Titanic\" as \"practically\" unsinkable prior to her sinking. Many survivors recalled in video interviews as well as in testimony that they had considered the ship \"unsinkable.\" Shipbuilder Harland and Wolff did not claim she was unsinkable, but a promotional item from the White Star Line stressed the safety of \"Olympic\" and \"Titanic\", claiming that \"as far as it is possible to do so, these two wonderful vessels are designed to be unsinkable\". Claims by trade publications that vessels were unsinkable or being practically unsinkable were not unique to the \"Olympic\" class liners or other White Star ships. Similar claims were made about the Cunarders \"Lusitania\" and \"Mauretania\", and German liners \"Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse\" and \"Kaiser Wilhelm II\". Advanced safety features on these liners were heavily publicized, de-emphasizing the likelihood of these ships' sinking in a serious accident.\n\nThe \"Titanic\" was designed to comply with the Grade 1 subdivision proposed by the 1891 Bulkhead Committee, meaning that it could stay afloat with any 2 adjoining out of its 16 main compartments open to the sea. The height of the bulkhead deck above the water line in flooded condition was well above the requirements, and the vessel would have been able to float with 3 adjoining compartments flooded in 11 of 14 possible combinations. The subdivisions could be sealed from communication with each other with cast iron watertight doors. To somewhat lower the chance of a sailor being caught in them, a geared system dropped the doors gradually, over 25 to 30 seconds, by sliding them vertically on hydraulic cataract cylinders.\n\nThe first unqualified assertion of \"Titanic\" unsinkability appeared in \"The New York Times\" on 16 April 1912, a day after the tragedy. Philip A. S. Franklin, vice president of the International Mercantile Marine Company (White Star Line's holding company) stated after being told of the sinking, \"I thought her unsinkable, and I based my opinion on the best expert advice available. I do not understand it.\" This comment was seized upon by the press, and the idea that the White Star Line had \"previously\" declared \"Titanic\" unsinkable (without qualification) gained immediate and widespread currency.\n\nAn often-quoted story that has been blurred between fact and fiction states that the first person to receive news of the sinking was David Sarnoff, who would later lead media giant RCA. In modified versions of this legend, Sarnoff was not the first to hear the news (though Sarnoff willingly promoted this notion), but he and others did staff the Marconi wireless station (telegraph) atop the Wanamaker Department Store in New York City, and for three days, relayed news of the disaster and names of survivors to people waiting outside. However, even this version lacks support in contemporary accounts. No newspapers of the time, for example, mention Sarnoff. Given the absence of primary evidence, the story of Sarnoff should be properly regarded as a legend.\n\nDespite popular belief, the sinking of \"Titanic\" was not the first time the internationally recognised Morse code distress signal \"SOS\" was used. The SOS signal was first proposed at the International Conference on Wireless Communication at Sea in Berlin in 1906. It was ratified by the international community in 1908 and had been in widespread use since then. The SOS signal was, however, rarely used by British wireless operators, who preferred the older CQD code. First Wireless Operator Jack Phillips began transmitting CQD until Second Wireless Operator Harold Bride half jokingly suggested, \"Send SOS; it's the new call, and this may be your last chance to send it.\" Phillips then began to intersperse SOS with the traditional CQD call.\n\nThere are reports that, in 1936, a ham radio operator named Gordon Cosgrave claimed to be receiving long delayed echo SOS messages from the \"Carpathia\" and \"Titanic\" 24 years after their transmission.\n\nOne of the most famous stories of \"Titanic\" is of the ship's band. On 15 April the eight-member band, led by Wallace Hartley, had assembled in the first-class lounge in an effort to keep passengers calm and upbeat. Later they moved on to the forward half of the boat deck. The band continued playing, even when it became apparent the ship was going to sink, and all members perished.\n\nThere has been much speculation about what their last song was. A first-class Canadian passenger, Mrs. Vera Dick, and several other passengers, alleged that the final tune played was that of the hymn \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\". Hartley reportedly once said to a friend if he were on a sinking ship, \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" would be one of the songs he would play. But Walter Lord's book \"A Night to Remember\" popularised wireless operator Harold Bride's 1912 account (\"New York Times\") that he heard the song \"Autumn\" before the ship sank. It is considered Bride either meant the hymn tune known as \"Autumn\" or the tune of the then-popular waltz \"Songe d'Automne\" but neither was in the White Star Line songbook for the band. Bride is one of only two witnesses who were close enough to the band, as he floated off the deck before the ship went down. Some consider his statement to be reliable. Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band's final moments. The notion that the band played \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of , which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick's recollection.\n\nThere are three, very different versions of the hymn using the lyrics of \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\": \"Horbury\", written in 1861 by the Rev John Dykes was popular in Britain, and another, \"Bethany\", written in 1856 by Dr Lowell Mason was popular in the U.S. The third tune associated with the hymn was \"Propior Deo\", was written by Sir Arthur Sullivan and was also popular in Britain. Additionally, the British melody might sound like the other hymn (\"Autumn\"). On 24 May 1912, the seven chief London orchestras performed at a memorial for the musicians who perished, as they played \"Horbury\", two \"Titanic\" survivors in the audience became emotional and stated that this was the tune they heard while they were in their lifeboat. The film \"A Night to Remember\" (1958) uses the tune \"Horbury\"; while the 1953 film \"Titanic\", with Clifton Webb, uses the tune \"Bethany\" as does James Cameron's 1997 \"Titanic.\" To further complicate things, \"Horbury\" was the Anglican version of the hymn, while \"Propior Deo\" was the Methodist version. The \"Titanic\"s bandmaster, Wallace Hartley was a devout Methodist and son of a Methodist choirmaster leading a band containing several devout Methodists. \"Propior Deo\" was not only sung at Hartley's funeral but was also carved into his headstone. Recently, another possibility has been raised. Among items left behind by Hartley's fiancée, Maria Robinson, was the sheet music of a third tune to the hymn written by Lewis Carey in 1902 and made popular by the Australian contralto Ada Crossley. As Crossley performed in both Britain and America, it is possible that this may have been a tune known to passengers on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nColonel Archibald Gracie, an amateur historian who was aboard the ship until the final moments, and was later rescued on a capsized collapsible lifeboat, wrote his account immediately after the sinking but died from his injuries eight months later. According to Gracie, the tunes played by the band were \"cheerful\" but that he didn't recognise any of them, claiming that if they had played \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" as claimed in the newspaper, \"I assuredly should have noticed it and regarded it as a tactless warning of immediate death to us all and one likely to create panic.\"\n\nAnother oft-cited \"Titanic\" legend concerns perished first-class passenger William Thomas Stead. According to this folklore, Stead had, through precognitive insight, foreseen his own death on the \"Titanic\". This is apparently suggested in two fictional sinking stories, which he penned decades earlier. The first, \"How the Mail Steamer Went Down in Mid-Atlantic, by a Survivor\" (1886), tells of a mail steamer's collision with another ship, resulting in high loss of life due to lack of lifeboats. The second, \"From the Old World to the New\" (1892) features a White Star Line vessel, \"Majestic\", that rescues survivors of another ship that had collided with an iceberg.\n\nSome believe that there was another ship, the Norwegian sealer \"Samson\", in the vicinity of \"Titanic\" when she sank. Proponents of the theory argue either that the \"Samson\" was a third ship in the area the night of the sinking, in addition to the \"Titanic\" and the \"Californian\", or that the \"Californian\" was not near at all and it was the \"Samson\" which \"Titanic\" passengers spotted in the distance while the ship was sinking. Advocates of Captain Lord's innocence have avidly adopted the latter theory, beginning with Leslie Harrison, the general secretary of the Mercantile Marine Association in the 1960's.\n\nThe root of this claim comes from the testimony of one of the \"Samson\"'s officers, Hendrik Bergethon Naess, who told a Norwegian newspaper in 1912 that his ship had been near a large liner with \"many lights\" shooting rockets into the sky the morning of April 15th. Because the \"Samson\" was seal hunting illegally in territorial waters, the ship's officers decided to move on quickly to avoid detection. This claim seems unlikely as the Titanic was 400 miles off the coast of Newfoundland, well beyond territorial waters in 1912. The ship had no radio, so they wouldn't have received any of the \"Titanic\"s distress signals. Naess claimed that the crew only became aware of the \"Titanic\"s sinking after they arrived in Isafjordur, Iceland in mid-May. If correct, the coordinates of \"Samson\" place her within 10 miles of \"Titanic\"s position as the ship was sinking. .\n\nTitanic historians have pointed to numerous inconsistencies in Neass' four published accounts. He cited the \"Samson\" as returning from seal-hunting south of Cape Hatteras (North Carolina), which is more than a thousand miles away from the cold waters of the Arctic circle where seals live. The \"Titanic\" historian Leslie Reade obtained microfilmed \"Lloyd's List\" records reporting that the \"Samson\" docked in Isafjordur twice that April: on the 6th and the 20th, then on the 15th of May. The April dates would not have allowed anywhere near enough time for the \"Samson\" to be in the vicinity of the \"Titanic\" on April 14. Furthermore, the idea that the crew of the \"Californian\" spotted the \"Sampson\" instead of \"Titanic\" is illogical since their descriptions are of a large steamer, not a small schooner like \"Samson\". And finally, no other crew member from the \"Samson\" ever gave testimony supporting Naess' claim.\n\nDefenders of the \"Samson\" theory argue that Neass said Cape Hatteras when he meant they were south of Cape Race, Newfoundland, seal-fishing waters which are physically very close to the site of \"Titanic\"s sinking. They argue that the Lloyd's Register dates of arrival in April are invalid because they were merely the \"expected\" arrival dates of the \"Samson\", which did not dock until the mid-May date. Such theories have been dismissed by \"Titanic\" historians including Leslie Reade, Walter Lord and Edward DeGroot.\n\nWhen \"Titanic\" sank, claims were made that a curse existed on the ship. The press quickly linked \"the \"Titanic\" curse\" with the White Star Line practice of not christening their ships.\n\nOne of the most widely spread legends linked directly into the sectarianism of the city of Belfast, where the ship was built. It was suggested that the ship was given the number 390904 which, when reflected, resembles the letters \"NOPOPE\", a sectarian slogan attacking Roman Catholics, used by extreme Protestants in Northern Ireland, where the ship was built. In the extreme sectarianism of the region at the time, the ship's sinking was alleged to be on account of anti-Catholicism by her manufacturers, the Harland and Wolff company, which had an almost exclusively Protestant workforce and an alleged record of hostility towards Catholics (Harland and Wolff did have a record of hiring few Catholics; whether that was through policy or because the company's shipyard in Belfast's bay was located in almost exclusively Protestant East Belfast—through which few Catholics would travel—or a mixture of both, is a matter of dispute). In fact, RMS \"Olympic\" and \"Titanic\" were assigned the yard numbers 400 and 401 respectively.\n\nAt the time the \"Titanic\" sank, the 1 May 1912 issue of \"The Popular Magazine\", an American pulp magazine, was on the news stands. It contained the short story \"The White Ghost of Disaster,\" which described the collision of an ocean liner with an iceberg in the Atlantic Ocean, the sinking of the vessel, and the fate of the passengers. The story, by Mayn Clew Garnett (the pseudonym of sea-story author T. Jenkins Hains), created a minor sensation. In 1898, fourteen years prior to the \"Titanic\" disaster,\nMorgan Robertson wrote a book called \"Futility, or the Wreck of the Titan\". This story features an enormous British passenger liner called the \"Titan\", which, deemed to be unsinkable, carries insufficient lifeboats. On a voyage in the month of April, the \"Titan\" hits an iceberg and sinks in the North Atlantic with the loss of almost everyone on board. There are some similarities between the fictional sinking of the \"Titan\" and the real-life sinking of the RMS \"Titanic\".\n\nIn 1912, the German \"Berliner Tageblatt\" newspaper published a book in serial form that ran from January 9 until April 24. This work of fiction was written by Gerhard Hauptmann, who would receive the Nobel Prize in Literature later that year. One month before the fateful April maiden voyage of the RMS \"Titanic\", the story was published by S. Fischer Verlag as the novel \"Atlantis\". \"Atlantis\" is a romantic tale set aboard the fictitious ocean liner \"Roland\", which is coincidentally doomed to a fate very similar to that of the RMS \"Titanic\". This perceived anticipation of the \"Titanic\" disaster received considerable attention at the time. A also titled \"Atlantis\" was produced by Nordisk Film based on the novel. The film was released less than a year following the actual tragic event. The association became evident, and it was banned in Norway, perceived as being in \"bad taste\".\n\n"}

The festival may have been so called from \"medendo\", because the Romans then began to drink new wine, which they mixed with old and which served them instead of physic.\n\nLittle information about the Meditrinalia survived from early Roman religion, although the tradition itself did. It was known to be somehow connected to Jupiter and to have been an important ceremony in early agricultural Rome, but beyond that, only speculation exists.\n\nMeditrina was a Roman goddess who seems to have been a late Roman invention to account for the origin of Meditrinalia. The earliest account of associating the Meditrinalia with such a goddess was by 2nd century grammarian Sextus Pompeius Festus, on the basis of which she is asserted by modern sources to be the Roman goddess of health, longevity and wine, with an etymological meaning of \"healer\" suggested by some.\n\n\n"}

At the same time, they announced a long-term sponsorship agreement with Canadian Tire as the title sponsor. They also introduced a television contract was signed with TSN to carry all events as inked with select races being aired live.\nThree of the series races, Edmonton, Toronto and Montreal, had crowds in excess of 50,000 fans.\n\nThe 2007 season was the inaugural season for the Series with the first event being held on May 26, 2007 at Cayuga Motor Speedway and Don Thomson Jr. won in a spirited battle for the first series win. Andrew Ranger, in his first year of stock-car competition, won the second race at Mosport International Raceway. He took over the lead in the point standings after that event and never relinquished it on his way to the first championship. The first season saw five races decided on last lap passes.The second season, the 2008 season, featured Scott Steckly who dominated many events. He won three of the first four events of the year and held the lead in the driver championship point standings all season long. He set a series record with four victories throughout the year.\n\nThe third season had Andrew Ranger taking center stage by winning his second series championship in three seasons. He completed his transition from the open-wheel racing world by incorporating his road courses experience with a strong performances on the oval tracks. On the season, he won a single-season series record six races—three on road courses and three on ovals.\n\nThe 2010 season belonged to D.J. Kennington. He won his first series title on the power of five wins, nine top fives and 11 top-10 finishes. Kennington battled JR Fitzpatrick for the points lead all season long as the two exchanged the top spot an unprecedented five times. Kennington also finished second to fellow Pinty's Series competitor Jason Bowles in the Toyota All-Star Showdown.\n\nIn 2011, Scott Steckly had a strong season where he won three events and finish in the runner up position four times on his way to capture his second championship over D.J. Kennington who had a pair of wins. Long time road racer Robin Buck and Rookie Peter Shepherd won their first events respectively. Andrew Ranger won the two biggest events of the year in dominant fashion at Montreal and Toronto. Former champion Don Thomson Jr. retired after a lengthy career.\n\nIn 2012, D.J. Kennington won a record seven events including five consecutively during the summer. Kennington would win his 2nd championship in 3 years. He faced competition from runners up J.R. Fitzpatrick and Andrew Ranger who both won two events.\n\nOn February 17, 2015, Canadian Tire announced it would not renew their sponsorship of the series after the 2015 season. On December 7, NASCAR and Pinty's Delicious Foods Inc. announced a six-year agreement to sponsor the series beginning with the 2016 season.\n\nThe 2018 Pinty's Series also included its first race in the United States, a 100-lap race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway as part of a tripleheader featuring the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East and the NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour 250.\n\nThe NASCAR Pinty's Series contains drivers with many different agendas and backgrounds. Veteran Canadian drivers compete in the series on part-time basis for fun while maintaining full-time careers, while others are serious championship contenders. Recent years, a NASCAR regional series driver from the United States will often run in the races to gain experience and with NASCAR's specification engine rule, gain more experience running with the said engine, such as Cale Gale, Jason Bowles, Timmy Hill, Tony Stewart, Dave Blaney and Austin Dillon. Drivers with open-wheel and road racing back grounds have also attempted races including, Jacques Villeneuve, Max Papis, Alex Tagliani, Jean-François Dumoulin and Patrick Carpentier. Even former National Hockey League player Patrice Brisebois runs in the major events which now feature over 40 cars.\n\nIn 2011 at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve a record three female drivers Maryeve Dufault, Caitlin Johnston and Isabelle Tremblay attempted the event, female drivers make up a good portion of the field.\n\nThe series is a development or feeder series for NASCAR's top national touring divisions. Driver like Fitzpatrick, Kennington, Ranger, Steckly and Thomson Jr. have competed in the Xfinity Series, while Pierre Bourque and Derek White have raced in the Camping World Truck Series. Ranger finished third in the 2009 NASCAR Nationwide Series event in Montreal after having a spirited battle with eventual race winner Carl Edwards for much of the race. He competed in the 2011 Sprint Cup Series event at Watkins Glen for FAS Lane Racing finishing 35th suffering from transmission failure.\n\nThe following are the tracks which have been, and are currently used in the NASCAR Pinty's Series:\n"}

{"id": "2337813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2337813", "title": "Nintendo World Championships", "text": "Nintendo World Championships\n\nThe Nintendo World Championships (NWC) is a nationwide video game competition video game tournament series, organized by Nintendo of America.\n\nThere have been three Championships. The first was in 1990, touring 30 American cities. It was based on a custom game cartridge for the Nintendo Entertainment System, which would historically become one of the most rare and valuable NES cartridges. On June 14, 2015, the second Nintendo World Championships event took place for its 25th anniversary as part of Nintendo's E3 2015 coverage. The third edition of the Nintendo World Championships was held on October 7, 2017.\n\nIn 2014, Nintendo released \"NES Remix 2\", featuring the reminiscent \"Nintendo World Championships Remix\", which uses emulation and online leaderboards to incite informal public competitiveness.\n\nPreceding the NWC in 1989 and in 1990, and coinciding with Nintendo's 100th anniversary, Nintendo started its first annual nationwide video game competition series as the Nintendo Challenge Championship (NCC) in Canada. Nintendo assumed full distribution and marketing from its partners and rebranded its competitions as the Nintendo World Championships.\n\nThe original Nintendo World Championships began on March 8–11, 1990, in the Fair Park's Automobile Building in Dallas, Texas, and ended up touring through 30 cities across the United States. Players from three separate age groups (11 and below, 12–17, and 18 and above) competed across three days. The top two scorers then competed for the title of City Champion. The finalists won a trophy, , and a trip for two to the World Finals at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, California. The runners-up won a Nintendo Power Pad and a Game Boy.\n\nThe World Finals were held December 7–9, 1990, conducted similarly to the City Championships and were located at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles, California within the Star Trek Theater, now Shrek 4-D. There, contestants played a special Nintendo World Championships cartridge for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The cartridge contains three customized minigames based upon the popular games \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Rad Racer\", and \"Tetris\". The objective is to achieve a high score according to a custom cumulative scoring formula across all games, within a total time limit of 6 minutes and 21 seconds.\n\nThree 1990 World Champion titles were given. Jeff Hansen won in the 11 and under category, Thor Aackerlund won in the 12–17 category, and Robert Whiteman won in the 18 and older category.\n\nThere was no official competition round to crown a single winner. However, after the competition ended there was an informal face-off between the three winners, with Thor Aackerlund taking first place, Jeff Hansen taking second, and Robert Whiteman finishing third.\n\nThe top winner in each age category were awarded a $10,000 U.S. savings bond, a new 1990 Geo Metro Convertible, a 40\" Rear-projection television, and a gold painted Mario trophy. Runners up in each age category received a $1,000 U.S. savings bond and a silver Mario trophy.\n\nThor Aackerlund later became the official games spokesperson for Camerica Corporation, a direct competitor to Nintendo, immediately after winning the Nintendo World Championship. Jeff Hansen later became the United States representative to Japan to win the World Championship title in Tokyo, Japan, and again in Las Vegas at a rematch with the Japanese champion, Yuichi Suyama.\nThe Nintendo World Championships competition was based on a custom NES cartridge by the same name. Ninety copies exist as the official gray cartridge, given to finalists after the championships concluded. Another twenty-six copies exist in gold, like \"The Legend of Zelda\" cartridge, and were given as prizes in a separate contest held by \"Nintendo Power\" magazine.\n\nThe \"Nintendo World Championships\" game cartridge is considered to be the most valuable NES cartridge ever released and one of the rarest, with collectors having been paid more than per copy.\n\nOn May 13, 2015, Nintendo announced the return of Nintendo World Championships for the event's 25th anniversary, as part of the company's E3 2015 coverage. Qualifying competitions began on May 30 in eight Best Buy locations across the United States. At each location, contestants competed for the high score in \"Ultimate NES Remix\". The winners from each of these eight locations, plus eight players invited by Nintendo, became the contestants for the final event.\n\nThe live video of the Championship's final event was streamed online from Los Angeles on June 14, 2015. The qualifying games were \"Splatoon\" (Wii U), \"The Legend of Zelda\" (NES), \"\" (3DS), \"Super Metroid\" (SNES), \"Mario Kart 8\" (Wii U), \"Balloon Fight\" (NES), and \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\" (Wii U). \n\nThe final contest consisted of custom levels within the then unreleased \"Super Mario Maker\" (Wii U), played by the two finalists: John Numbers and professional speedrunner Narcissa Wright (then known as Cosmo Wright). In the first two levels the players were alternately blindfolded while the other played. The player who completed the levels the fastest would receive a 5-second advantage in the final level. In the final level they then raced simultaneously to the end, where John Numbers won the championship title. Gamesradar said that Numbers demonstrated \"impulsive mastery\" of the \"Super Mario Maker\" levels which were \"hellish\", \"sadistic\", \"evil\", and \"truly weird\". Shigeru Miyamoto made a surprise appearance to present a trophy to the winner, and an autographed New Nintendo 3DS XL system to each of the two finalists.\n\nOn August 8, 2017, Nintendo of America announced the return of the Nintendo World Championships. Qualifying rounds took place August 19, 2017 through September 10, 2017 at selected Best Buy locations across eight cities in the United States. John Numbers, the returning champion of 2015, was one of the 13-and-older qualifiers.\n\nThe main event was held on October 7, 2017 at the Manhattan Center's Grand Ballroom, and was streamed online via YouTube and Twitch.tv, as well as being simulcast on Disney XD's \"D|XP\" block. It used an elimination tournament format with a repechage bracket named the Underground, with competition based on a wide history of Nintendo's game library since the 1980s. This includes select gameplay modes and levels from \"\" (Switch/Wii U, 2017), \"Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\", \"\" (3DS, 2017), \"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\" (Switch, 2017), \"Splatoon 2\" (Switch, 2017), \"Balloon Fight\" (NES, 1985), and other games for those consoles and for Nintendo 64, Wii, Nintendo DS, and Game Boy.\n\nThe overall winner was Thomas G, who defeated the 2015 champion John Numbers.\n\nIn 2015, Gamesradar summarized that \"The \"Super Mario Maker\" climax ended Nintendo's championships on a pitch-perfect retro note.\" Contestant Joshua Ovenshire of Smosh Games said that the Nintendo World Championships should be \"a staple at every E3\", summarizing, \"I was a part of Nintendo history. That's where the magic is at.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56779679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56779679", "title": "Online child abuse", "text": "Online child abuse\n\nOnline child abuse is a unique form of child abuse due to its virtual, distanced, and anonymous nature. Such abuse may not happen face-to-face, nor does it necessarily require physical contact. However, online abuse can result in negative face-to-face consequences in the form of statutory rape, forcible sexual assault, harassment, etc. In the United States, online child abuse is recognized as a form of child abuse by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.\n\nOnline abuse of children can occur through a variety of forms including, but not limited to cyber-bullying, grooming, and sexual abuse. Such abuse requires the use of the World Wide Web or cellphones, increasing its significance in an increasingly technological world. The perpetrator of such online abuse may be a stranger or someone who is previously known by the victim.\nA report by the Data & Society Research Institute and the Center for Innovative Public Health Research showed that 72% of U.S. Internet users have witnessed some form of online harassment or abuse, while 47% have personally experienced it. This study found no distinction between genders with respect to harassment, but deduced that women were at risk for a wider variety of online abuse.\n\nGovernments across the world have acknowledged the importance of recognizing and combating online abuse of children. In the United States this effort is led by the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. This task force consists of 61 individual task forces engaging with 4,500 federal, state, and local law-enforcement agencies all with the goal of combating online abuse of children.\n\nCyber-bullying, or Internet bullying, occurs when an individual or group electronically distributes negative, false, or otherwise harmful content about an individual or group using personal or private information that causes humiliation or distress to that individual. Cyber-bullying can happen through the use of any device that is able to connect to the Internet (desktop, mobile devices, gaming devices, etc.) of cellphones and does not require the perpetrator to be in the same vicinity of the victim.\nCyber-bullying is especially prevalent among children as an extension of bullying within schools. A Canadian research study found that children who were victims of cyber-bullying and also bullied in school were more likely to bully others over cyberspace.\n\nStudies show a rising trend in online bullying. Although it remains the least-reported form of bullying it is relatively hidden and believed to be under-reported. Because victims often cannot evade cyber-bullies, they may harbor feelings of guilt, incompetence or despair. Upwards of 37% of victims of cyber-bullying do not report their abuse. According to statistics of cyber-bullying from the i-SAFE Foundation, more than 50% of adolescents have been the victims of cyber-bullying, where one-third of them have been threatened online. A roughly equal number admit to having engaged in perpetrating cyber-bullying themselves. Of the victims that reported their abuse, 25% reported repeated cyber-bullying. The \"Harford County Examiner\" reported that far more than 50% of child victims hid the issue from their parents when it occurred. The same examination reported that 1 in 10 youths had damaging photos taken of themselves without their permission, and that girls are more likely to be involved with cyber-bullying than boys, both as bullies and as victims. Different social groups and ages tend to receive differing amounts of unwanted negative feedback. For example, a reported 55.2% of young LGBTQ community members have been victims of cyber-bullying. Another trend shows that school-aged children are more likely to be victims of online abuse.\n\nA study in 2011 found three primary reasons for targeting others over the Internet: informal social control, dominance, and entertainment. Informal social control is applying pressure to change another person's behavior. Dominance refers to the attempt(s) of hurting someone, humiliating someone, or gaining access to their personal information (secrets, explicit photos, etc.). Entertainment refers to what is commonly known as trolling: purposefully humiliating, annoying, or bothering someone for the purpose of eliciting an emotional response for the bully's enjoyment. Perpetrators of trolling are called \"trolls\", which are a subset of cyberbullies.\n\nCyber-bullying is very common among children and young adults that are ten to eighteen years old. Victims of cyber-bullying, often feel negative about themselves after being bullied. It is also common for cyber-bullying to have negative effects on cyber victims' social well-being because it has a negative impact on their self-esteem. Another consequence of cyber-bullying is that a cyber victim may fear for their own safety. Further research conducted by Patchin & Hinduja (2010) found that those involved with cyber-bullying, as perpetrators, victims, or both, have significantly lower self-esteem than those who have little to no exposure to cyber-bullying. Kowalski & Limber (2013) also found that bullies and victims had the most negative scores on most measures of psychological health, physical, health, and academic performance.\n\nIn the United States, parents are encouraged to monitor their children's online activity and deal with cyber-bullying appropriately. If cyber-bullying involves sexual content or sexting, however, the cyberbully and their parents can also be subject to legal consequences, including being registered as sexual offenders. Cyber-bullying that does not involve explicit sexual content can be more difficult to prosecute because there are no federal laws directly protecting children from direct forms of cyber-bullying. Cases of cyber-bullying are difficult to pursue in the United States due to infringement on First Amendment rights (i.e.: freedom of speech).\n\nU.S. schools can take action on incidents that occur outside of school if there is either a clear 'disruption to the educational process' or a 'true' threat to one (or more) of the students. For an expression to be considered a 'true' threat, the federal court must determine \"whether a reasonable person would foresee that the statement would be interpreted by those to whom the maker communicates the statement as a serious expression of intent to harm or assault\". As cyberbulling is increasingly recognized as a nationwide issue in the United States, whether or not public schools can limit their students' speech outside of school hours is becoming more of an issue.\n\nHigh-profile cases of cyberbullying have been brought to the attention of state and local legislatures, and most U.S. states have implemented laws that ban any online communication that aims to cause humiliation, emotional distress, or fright. Prosecution of cyber-bullying cases are usually a combination of civil laws that best fit the nature of each individual case. Most states have both anti-bullying laws and policies, save for Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas. Stopbullying.gov, a federal agency tasked with preventing all forms of bullying, has created a detailed list of state laws and policies. An examples of a state anti-bullying campaign is the Massachusetts Aggression Reduction Center, which provides curriculum to educators about cyber-bullying and its connection to bullying inside of schools.\n\nCyber-bullying was specifically targeted in federal law by the Megan Meier Cyber-bullying Prevention Act introduced to the House of Representatives in 2009. This prevention act sought to:\n\nThis act was the result of the suicide of Megan Meier in 2006. Megan was the victim of cyber-bullying by a mother and teen daughter, which resulted in Megan committing suicide in her home in Missouri.\n\nGrooming is a phenomenon that can occur on or offline. The official definition of grooming used by the U.S. Department of Justice is: \nThe above definition emphasizes the use of the child's family in building trust with the child. When grooming occurs online, however, this is frequently done without the knowledge or compliance of any adult. When children can use the Internet without supervision, there is more room for potential abuse.\n\nOnline grooming itself can be driven by a variety of things. Most common is the use of online grooming to build a trusting relationship with a child in order to engage in either online or in-person sexual acts. The Internet is used to lead a child to potential sexual behavior. Grooming can also be used for other forms of exploitation of the child, such as blackmail for monetary gain and more. The two forms may be used in combination, with groomers convincing children to perform these sexual acts, such as the sending of nude photographs, and then blackmailing the victim by threatening to release information about them.\n\nOnline grooming can occur in a variety of ways. Most commonly, chat rooms or social networks are used to make initial contact with possible victims. Groomers may also use photo-sharing apps, dating apps, or gaming websites to find their victims. After establishing an online relationship, the groomer turns conversations to more personal matters, frequently sexual topics. Groomers may then engage in sexual conversations with their victims, send nude photos or videos, encourage sexual acts on webcam, or persuade the victim to meet in person for sexual acts.\nGroomers are not exclusively strangers. They can be family friends or individuals who have met the child before but primarily use the Internet in order to strengthen that relationship for future exploitation of the child. Individual groomers can be of any sex, gender, or age. Grooming is considered a complicated matter, and groomers may use many tactics. Groomers may use compliments or make promises to the child in order to elicit certain behaviors. Groomers may also assert control over the child to exploit natural sexual curiosity.\n\nFrequently, groomers make a fake profile in order to create a persona more likely to be trusted by their possible victims. Such a phenomenon is known as catfishing. The definition of a catfish is \"a person who sets up a false personal profile on a social networking site for fraudulent or deceptive purposes.\" Although catfishing is not exclusively used by online groomers, it is a common way in which groomers contact their potential victim and build trust through a more-trustworthy false identity. Catfishing itself is not illegal in the United States, unlike identity theft, but when used as a method for online grooming is considered as the crime of grooming.\n\nGrooming and overall online abuse of children is an issue of growing concern in the modern technological era. Victims of online grooming are frequently young teens, with the majority of victims being between the ages of 13 and 15. In a 2012 literature review of research in the area conducted by various English scholarly institutions, it was found that 9% of Internet users aged 10–17 reported unwanted online sexual solicitation or attempted grooming.\n\nIn the United States, grooming is considered a federal offense. Several federal laws include sections involving grooming. Under section § 2422 of the United States Criminal Code:\nThe U.S. Bar Association claims that this statute \"targets the sexual grooming of minors as well as the actual sexual exploitation of them.\"\n\nBecause of grooming's complex nature and the relationship of trust between the groomer and the victim, grooming in and of itself is infrequently left unrecognized. Only when the grooming results in sexual acts between an adult and a minor, the exchange of sexual images, or the extortion of money does it come to the eyes of a court. In the case of Shelly Chartier, the online grooming and resulting crimes were met with jail time. Chartier, through the use of catfishing both NBA star Chris Andersen and aspiring model Paris Dunn, groomed 17-year-old Dunn into exchanging nude photos and sexual acts under the false identity of Andersen. She then sent such images to Andersen who was under the impression that he was both receiving these from Dunn herself and that Dunn was not underage. Chartier then extorted money from Andersen, claiming she would reveal his possession of child pornography unless he paid her. Chartier was eventually caught and faced 18 months in prison for various crimes, including, but not limited to, extortion, impersonation, and making threats. State legislatures, such as Illinois, have introduced language that specifically includes electronic or web-based methods of grooming into their laws.\n\nIn addition to legislation, there are several non-governmental programs and initiatives aimed at the issue. For example, R.AGE, a Malaysian-based group of journalists, aims to spread information about many important issues, including online safety and the occurrence of online grooming, in the hopes of \"telling stories that matter, that make a difference, that hold people accountable, that give a voice to those who don't have one.\"\nIn addition, Pandora's Protect is a nonprofit organization that aims to provide support to the victims of crimes such as online grooming and assault. In addition, they spread information in order to prevent further assaults.\n\nOnline sexual abuse is a relatively modern trend, in which perpetrators utilize modern forms of technology such as live stream web cameras, cell phones, or social media to coerce targeted victims into inappropriate and sometimes illegal sex acts. Abusers do not discriminate and target victims of every walk of life. Online sexual abuse differs from other forms of sexual abuse in that it can be perpetrated stealthily on a global scale, allowing the offender to evade capture. At the same time, technology offers predators greater opportunities to find the youth that they prey upon. Children are often the targets of online sexual predators who will often bully, emotionally manipulate, blackmail, or befriend willing communicators on the web in order to obtain their desires. Online sexual abuse may vary from personal interactions between a victim and offender to a more mechanized process, in which children are sexually exploited for the perpetrators' profit. Online sexual predators often target young victims, with a study showing that 13% of children receive negative unwanted attention of a sexual nature on the Internet. Predators make contact with prospective targets in a variety of settings, although the most prolific place that predators troll is chat rooms, where 76% of known first encounters with online sexual predators occur. Predators troll chat rooms and other forms of social media like MySpace of Facebook, seeking people who outwardly share personal information.\n\nDetection and deterrence of online sexual abuse are difficult because of the anonymous nature of the Internet; however, stopping and detecting an online predator's criminal activity is the task of various government organizations like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI's Violent Crimes Against Children Program was specifically created, \"...to provide a rapid, proactive, and comprehensive counter to all threats of abuse and exploitation of children\" in its jurisdiction. The FBI accomplishes quick response times by having agents scouring the Internet in search of perpetrators; they ask for information in forums and chat-rooms and look for the telltale signs of abusive behavior in the children they interact with. Online sexual predators, however, are often diffisult to distinguish because they show a misleading representation of themselves to avoid incriminating evidence. Rather than relying completely on authorities to apprehend the perpetrators of online sexual abuse, one may decrease the chances of unwanted and unsolicited advances from online predators by keeping one's intimately private details off of the Internet. Another way to avoid unwanted sexual solicitations is to ignore, block, and report an offender to the website's management staff.\n\nA variety of laws are in place to deter online criminal activity pertaining to sexual abuse. The \"Federal Criminal Code and Rules\" outlines a variety of rules and regulations regarding sexual abuse under Title 18 of the United States Code. Section 1462 titled \"Importation or transportation of obscene matters\", outlines what would be considered transporting obscene material over the Internet. Child pornography violates this law, among others, because under this code, \"Any obscene, lewd, lascivious, or filthy book, pamphlet, picture, motion-picture film, paper, letter, writing, print, or other matter of indecent character\" may be subject to fine or imprisonment of up to five years.\n\nOnline sexual offenders who target children may also fall under the jurisdiction of Section 2243 \"Sexual abuse of a minor or ward\" or Section 2251 \"Sexual exploitation of children\" under which they could be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. These sections are outlined as, \"...aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact involving a minor or ward, or sex trafficking of children, or the production, possession, receipt, mailing, sale, distribution, shipment, or transportation of child pornography ... not less than 30 years or for life [or can carry] any term years or for life.\" As noted, any sexual abuse of children, whether online or in person, is subject to strict punishment by law.\n\nOnline abuse often manifests itself in physical and psychological harm to victims, as previously stated. In recent history, Larry Nassar, a USA Gymnastics team doctor, was charged with 60 years in federal prison when he pleaded guilty to charges related to receiving child pornography, possessing child pornography, and destroying and concealing evidence relating to child pornography. Prosecutors have stated that a supremely close link between his child pornography activities had directly impacted his repeat, \"molestation of children\". At the height of his child pornography obsession, Nassar had thousands of pictures of underage children. In the wake of this scandal, affecting hundreds of women of a variety of ages, reforms have been made to further combat future occurrences of this abuse by USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. Also gathering a large following in the wake of this scandal is the Me Too movement.\n\n"}
{"id": "8884064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8884064", "title": "Operation Eagle Pull", "text": "Operation Eagle Pull\n\nOperation Eagle Pull was the United States military evacuation by air of Phnom Penh, Cambodia, on 12 April 1975. At the beginning of April 1975, Phnom Penh, one of the last remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the Gulf of Thailand. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.\n\nAt the beginning of 1975 the Khmer Republic, a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the Mekong River that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from South Vietnam. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge set out to cut off the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked Neak Luong, a key Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack over the journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit naval mines laid by the Khmer Rouge at Phu My approximately from Phnom Penh. The FANK naval branch, the Khmer National Navy (MNK), had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or at best extremely costly. The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded.\n\nBy 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line. In future, all supplies for Phnom Penh would have to come in by air to Pochentong Airport. The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case–Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong.\n\nOn 5 March, Khmer Rouge artillery at Toul Leap, north-west of Phnom Penh, shelled Pochentong Airport, but FANK troops recaptured Toul Leap on 15 March and ended the shelling. Khmer Rouge forces continued to close in on the north and west of the city and were soon able to fire on Pochentong again. On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift. On 1 April the Khmer Rouge overran Neak Luong and Ban-am, the last remaining FANK positions on the Mekong. The Communists could now concentrate all their forces on Phnom Penh. Premier Lon Nol resigned that day and went into exile; the final collapse of the Khmer Republic was imminent.\n\nThe evacuation plan was developed and refined by the US Military as Khmer Rouge forces closed in on Phnom Penh, starting as early as 1973. On 27 June 1973 the Seventh Air Force published Contingency Plan 5060C \"Eagle Pull\" covering the evacuation of Phnom Penh. Conplan 5060C had three options:\n\nOption 3 was later revised to provide for the use of USMC helicopters together with USAF helicopters and C-130 Airborne Mission Command based in Thailand, and for the ground security force to be made up of marines rather than air force security police. The LZs were to be adjacent to the US Embassy in Phnom Penh.\n\nOn 6 January 1975, CINCPAC placed the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit on 96-hour alert to move the evacuation fleet into position off Kampong Som (previously Sihanoukville) in the Gulf of Thailand for the implementation of Operation Eagle Pull. On 6 February the reaction time was reduced to 48 hours, meaning that the evacuation fleet had to maintain a 48-hour cruising radius from Kampong Som. This was further reduced on 28 February to 24 hours, effectively meaning that the fleet had to remain within the Gulf of Thailand.\n\nOn 21 March the Embassy predicted there would be 3,600 evacuees, far exceeding the original estimate of approximately 400. This necessitated the development of a new evacuation plan whereby Marines would secure Pochentong Airport, while helicopters would ferry evacuees from central Phnom Penh to Pochentong from where they would be flown on C-130 planes to Thailand. However, this plan was quickly overtaken by events as the supply C-130s coming into Pochentong were used for evacuees on the return journey, quickly reducing the number of evacuees that would need to be moved in a final evacuation.\n\nOn 3 April, given the deterioration in the defences around Phnom Penh, Ambassador John Gunther Dean requested the deployment of the 10-man Operation Eagle Pull command element which landed at Pochentong on a BirdAir C-130 plane. The command element supervised the ongoing fixed-wing evacuation of more than 750 Cambodians over the next seven days in the face of 80–90 rounds of 105 mm artillery and 107 mm rocket fire each day. By 10 April Khmer Rouge fire had become so heavy that the fixed-wing evacuation was ended.\n\nThe command group then turned its attention to the selection of helicopter landing zones for the evacuation. As the Khmer Rouge controlled the east bank of the Mekong opposite Phnom Penh, the command group selected LZ Hotel, a soccer field about north-east of the embassy. Masked from the river by a row of apartment buildings, this LZ could not be interdicted by direct fire weapons, making it the safest location. The embassy staff prepared to leave on 11 April, but the evacuation was delayed until the following day in order to allow to join the evacuation fleet off Kampong Som.\n\nOn 3 March 1975 Amphibious Ready Group Alpha (Task Group 76.4), and the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit (Task Group 79.4) embarked and arrived at the designated station off Kampong Som in the Gulf of Thailand, the force comprised:\n\nTask Group 76.4 (Movement Transport Group Alpha)\n\nEscort ships for naval gunfire, escort, and area defense:\n\nOn 17 March the Joint Chiefs of Staff, concerned that one Marine helicopter squadron was insufficient for the evacuation, ordered that USS \"Hancock\" offload its air wing and proceed to Pearl Harbor. On 26 March Marine Heavy Lift Helicopter Squadron HMH-463 comprising 25 CH-53, CH-46, AH-1J and UH-1E helicopters embarked on USS \"Hancock\" and it proceeded to Subic Bay. After taking on more helicopters at Subic Bay, USS \"Hancock\" was temporarily assigned to Amphibious Ready Group Bravo, standing by off Vung Tau, South Vietnam, but on 11 April she joined Amphibious Ready Group Alpha in the Gulf of Thailand. The marine evacuation contingent comprised one battalion landing team, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines (2/4).\n\nAs the Khmer Rouge had no air force and only limited anti-aircraft capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.\n\nOn the afternoon of 11 April 1975, the 31st MAU received orders to execute Operation Eagle Pull. At 06:00 on 12 April, 12 CH-53s of HMH-462 launched from the deck of USS \"Okinawa\" and then at 10-minute intervals descended again to pick up their marines. Elements of Companies F and H, and the command group embarked from USS \"Okinawa\" while elements of Company G boarded their helicopters on USS \"Vancouver\", giving a total ground security force of 360 Marines. As the helicopters completed loading they formed into groups of three orbiting the task force.\n\nAt 07:30 Ambassador Dean notified the acting Cambodian Chief of State, Prime Minister Long Boret and other Cambodian leaders including Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak, that the US personnel would officially leave the country within the next few hours and asked if any desired evacuation, in which case they should be at the embassy by 09:30. All declined except for Saukham Khoy, successor to Lon Nol as President of the Khmer Republic, who left without telling his fellow leaders. Prince Sirik Matak, a former Prime Minister and a driving force behind the formation of the Khmer Republic rejected the offer of evacuation and said to Ambassador Dean that \"I have committed this mistake of believing in you, the Americans.\"\n\nThe 10 man command group proceeded to drive vehicles to LZ Hotel, purposely disabling them to block vehicle access from any part of the city, other than the road from the Embassy to the LZ. The command group then proceeded to make contact with \"King Bird\", an orbiting HC-130 plane of the 56th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, that would control the flow of the helicopters.\n\nAt 07:43 the first group of helicopters crossed the Cambodian coastline and about one hour later, after traversing of hostile territory, the initial wave set down on LZ Hotel and the Marines quickly established a defensive perimeter. Large crowds of Cambodians soon gathered, more out of curiosity rather than to interfere. Having established the perimeter defense, the marines began the process of moving the crowds back in order to keep the LZ clear and then began moving the evacuee groups to the waiting CH-53 helicopters. As LZ Hotel could only hold three CH-53s at any time, flights arriving after the initial build-up had to be held at Point Oscar, some south of Phnom Penh until called in by \"King Bird\". The evacuation proceeded smoothly although the number of evacuees was substantially less than anticipated. The last estimate indicated there would be 590 evacuees, 146 US nationals and 444 Cambodians and third country nationals. HMH-462 evacuated 84 US nationals and 205 Cambodians and third country nationals.\n\nAt 09:45, the US Embassy closed. There would be no diplomatic relations between the US and Cambodia again until 11 November 1991. By 10:41 all the evacuees including Ambassador Dean and President Saukham Khoy had been lifted out by helicopters of HMH-462. Helicopters of HMH-463 operating from USS \"Hancock\" then began to land to extract the ground security force.\n\nAt approximately 10:50, 107 mm rocket fire began impacting in the vicinity of LZ Hotel. Less than 10 minutes later, the LZ also received 82 mm mortar fire. As soon as the Khmer Rouge fire commenced, the controllers in the zone notified the Air Force forward air controllers (FACs) flying overhead in 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron OV-10s. The FACs immediately made low passes over the east bank of the Mekong, but could not spot any fire coming from known enemy positions in that location. At 10:59, the last element of 2nd Battalion 4th Marines left the zone and the last marine helicopter landed on USS \"Okinawa\" at 12:15.\n\nAt 11:15, two USAF HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giants, from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, as scheduled, extracted the Eagle Pull command element. Small arms fire during the final extraction caused minimal damage to the first aircraft, but a machine gun round hit the second helicopter's tail rotor as it climbed out of the zone. Despite severe vibrations the helicopter made it safely back to Ubon Air Base in Thailand. At 14:50 an HMH-462 CH-53 launched from USS \"Okinawa\" to carry Ambassador Dean to U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand.\n\nOn 13 April, the evacuees were flown to U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand on HMH-462 helicopters and Amphibious Ready Group Alpha proceeded to the South China Sea to rendezvous with Task Force 76 as it stood by to implement Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon.\n\nHenry Kissinger observed in his Vietnam War memoir that the Ford Administration was astonished and shamed by the fact that top Cambodian officials refused to leave the country. These included Premier Long Boret and Lon Non, the Prime Minister's brother, both of whom were on the Khmer Rouge's advertised death list.\n\nOn 17 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh bringing the Cambodian Civil War to an end. Long Boret, Lon Non and other top officials of the Khmer Republic Government were executed at the \"Cercle Sportif\" (ironically now the location of the US Embassy), while FANK troops in the city were disarmed, taken to the Olympic Stadium and executed.\n\nFor 2/4 Marines and Amphibious Ready Group Alpha, Operation Eagle Pull served as a small-scale dress rehearsal for the more complex Operation Frequent Wind 17 days later.\n\nOperation Eagle Pull is depicted in the film \"The Killing Fields\".\n\n"}
{"id": "20960936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20960936", "title": "Phil Lamason", "text": "Phil Lamason\n\nPhillip John Lamason DFC & Bar (15 September 1918 – 19 May 2012) was a pilot in the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) during the Second World War, who rose to prominence as the senior officer in charge of 168 Allied airmen taken to Buchenwald concentration camp, Germany, in August 1944. Raised in Napier, he joined the RNZAF in September 1940, and by April 1942 was a pilot officer serving with the Royal Air Force in Europe. On 8 June 1944, Lamason was in command of a Lancaster heavy bomber that was shot down during a raid on railway marshalling yards near Paris. Bailing out, he was picked up by members of the French Resistance and hidden at various locations for seven weeks. While attempting to reach Spain along the Comet line, Lamason was double-crossed by a traitor within the Resistance and handed over to the Gestapo.\n\nAfter interrogation, he was taken to Fresnes prison. Classified as a \"Terrorflieger\" (terror flier), he was not accorded prisoner-of-war (POW) status, but instead treated as a criminal and spy. By 15 August 1944, Lamason was senior officer of a group of 168 captured Allied airmen who were taken by train to Buchenwald concentration camp, arriving there five days later.\n\nAt Buchenwald, the airmen were fully shaved, starved, denied shoes, and for three weeks forced to sleep outside without shelter in one of the sub-camps known as \"Little Camp\". As senior officer, Lamason took control and instilled a level of military discipline and bearing.\n\nFor several weeks Lamason negotiated with the camp authorities to have the airmen transferred to a POW camp, but his requests were denied. At great risk, Lamason secretly got word to the Luftwaffe of the Allied airmen's captivity and, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 prisoners were transferred to Stalag Luft III. Most of the airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason. After the war, he moved to Dannevirke and became a farmer until his retirement. During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a regular speaker at KLB Club and POW reunions.\n\nLamason was born and raised in Napier, a city in New Zealand's North Island, on 15 September 1918. He was educated at Napier Boys' High School and Massey University (Palmerston North campus) where he was awarded a Diploma in Sheepfarming.\n\nDuring this period, Lamason described himself as \"a bit of a ratbag\". Prior to the war, he worked for the Department of Agriculture at New Plymouth as a stock inspector. It was there Lamason took the opportunity of free flying lessons, clocking up 100 hours. He was described as a tall, good-looking man with blue eyes and a broken nose.\n\nLamason joined the RNZAF in September 1940. By April 1942, he had been posted to the European theatre of operations as a pilot officer in No. 218 Squadron RAF. During a bombing raid on Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, he was in command of an aircraft that was attacked by an enemy fighter and badly damaged, but managed to return to base. As a result of his actions, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 15 May 1942. The citation read:\n\nAfter his first tour ended flying Stirlings with 218 Squadron, Lamason then instructed other pilots at 1657 Heavy Conversion Unit. Returning to operations with No. 15 Squadron RAF, Lamason was twice Mentioned in Despatches, first on 2 June 1943 and again, having received promotion to acting squadron leader, on 14 January 1944. He was awarded a Bar to his DFC on 27 June 1944, for \"courage and devotion to duty of a high order\" and \"vigorous determination\" in attacks on Berlin and other heavily defended targets. Lamason was presented his award after the war by King George VI at Buckingham Palace, where he met and befriended a young Princess Elizabeth. A day after making an emergency landing at an American base in England, Lamason was introduced to, shook hands and spoke with Clark Gable.\n\nLamason was not afraid to speak his mind. On the night of 30/31 March 1944, when 795 bombers were sent to attack Nuremberg, he was very critical of the route chosen, warning his station commander that heavy losses could be expected. On the moonlit night, 95 bombers were lost, its heaviest losses of the entire war during a single raid.\n\nOn 8 June 1944, Lamason was serving as a flight commander in a Lancaster LM575 LS-H of No. 15 Squadron RAF, on his 45th operation, when he was shot down during a raid on railway marshalling yards at Massy-Palaiseau near Paris.\n\nLamason recalled: \n\nAlong with his English navigator, Flying Officer Ken Chapman, Lamason was picked up by members of the French Resistance and hidden at various locations for seven weeks. In August 1944, while attempting to reach Spain along the Comet line, Lamason and Chapman were captured by the Gestapo in Paris after they were betrayed by the French double agent Jacques Desoubrie for 10,000 francs each. After interrogation at the Gestapo headquarters in Paris, they were taken to Fresnes Prison. Many fliers were classified as \"Terrorflieger\" (terror flier) by the Germans, and were not given a trial. The most common act for allied airmen to be classified a terror flier was to be captured in civilian clothing and/or without their dog tags. The German Foreign Office decided that these captured enemy airmen should not be given the legal status of prisoner of war (POWs) but should instead be treated as criminals and spies.\n\nConsequently, Lamason was among a group of 168 allied airmen from Great Britain, United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Jamaica who—along with over 2,500 French prisoners—were taken by train—in overcrowded cattle boxcars — from Fresnes Prison outside Paris, to Buchenwald concentration camp. As the airmen were herded into the boxcars, Lamason protested about the poor treatment of the airmen, only to be struck in the face by a SS guard. Lamason fell to the ground and captured pilot Roy Allen watched as a SS Major pulled a Luger from his holster and thought Lamason would be shot on the spot. After five days travel, during which the airmen received very little food or water, they arrived at Buchenwald on 20 August 1944.\n\nBuchenwald was a labour camp of about 60,000 inmates of mainly Russian POWs, but also common criminals, religious prisoners (including Jews), and various political prisoners from Germany, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. It was known for its brutality and barbaric medical experiments.\n\nUpon arrival, Lamason, as ranking officer, demanded an interview with the camp commandant, Hermann Pister, which he was granted. He insisted that the airmen be treated as POWs under the Geneva Conventions and be sent to a POW camp. The commandant agreed that their arrival at Buchenwald was a \"mistake\" but they remained there anyway. The airmen were given the same poor treatment and beatings as the other inmates. For the first three weeks at Buchenwald, the prisoners were totally shaved, denied shoes and forced to sleep outside without shelter in one of Buchenwald's sub-camps, known as 'Little Camp'. Little Camp was a quarantine section of Buchenwald where the prisoners received the least food and harshest treatment.\n\nAfter their first meal, Lamason stepped forward and said:\n\nLamason then instructed the group not to trust the SS, or provoke them in any way because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but to stay together and keep as far away from the guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.\n\nLamason then proceeded to organise the airmen into groups by nationality and appointed a Commanding officer within each group. Lamason did not do this just to improve their morale but because he also saw it as his responsibility to carry on his war duties despite the adverse circumstances. Captured US pilot Joe Moser believed that Lamason also did this because if the right opportunity presented itself, the group would be able to operate much more effectively if military discipline and operations were applied.\n\nLamason's leadership boosted the airmen's spirits and gave them hope while instilling a level of discipline and bearing. One of the first assignments Lamason gave was to mount a guard detail, both day and night, to prevent pilfering by other inmates, which had begun during their first night at camp. During their incarceration, Lamason insisted the airmen march, parade and act as a military unit.\n\nWithin days of their arrival, Lamason met Edward Yeo-Thomas, a British spy being held at Buchenwald under the alias Kenneth Dodkin. Lamason, who knew the real Dodkin quite well, immediately became suspicious and later confided in Christopher Burney, who assured Lamason the cover was legitimate. Through Yeo-Thomas and Burney, Lamason was introduced to two Russian colonels, senior members of the International Camp Committee, an illegal underground resistance group of prisoners in the main camp.\n\nAs senior officer, Lamason had access to the main camp and quickly built a rapport with the group. As a result, he was able to secure extra blankets, clothes, clogs and food for the airmen. Lamason also built a rapport with two other prisoners; French scientist Alfred Balachowsky and Dutch Olympian trainer Jan Robert. Both men had developed trustworthy contacts within the camp administrative area and were able to provide Lamason with reliable intelligence that assisted in the survival of the airmen.\n\nFor the next six weeks, Lamason negotiated with Pister and the German camp authorities, but his requests to have the airmen transferred to proper POW camps were denied. One captured British airman, Pilot Officer Splinter Spierenburg, was a Dutchman flying for the Royal Air Force. Spierenburg, who spoke fluent German, regularly acted as an interpreter for Lamason when he negotiated with the camp authorities.\n\nAs Buchenwald was a forced labor camp, the German authorities had intended to put the 168 airmen to work as slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could not and would not participate in war production. After a tense stand-off, during which time Lamason thought he would be shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.\n\nMost airmen doubted they would ever get out of Buchenwald because their documents were stamped with the acronym \"DIKAL\" (Darf in kein anderes Lager), or \"not to be transferred to another camp\". At great risk, Lamason and Burney secretly smuggled a note through a trusted Russian prisoner, who worked at the nearby Nohra airfield, to the German Luftwaffe of their captivity at the camp. The message requested in part, that an officer pass the information to Berlin, and for the Luftwaffe to intercede on behalf of the airmen. Lamason understood that the Luftwaffe would be sympathetic to their predicament, as they would not want their captured men treated in the same way; he also knew that the Luftwaffe had the political connections to get the airmen transferred to a POW camp.\n\nEventually, Lamason's persistence paid off. Under the pretence of inspecting aerial bomb damage near the camp, two Luftwaffe officers (including Hannes Trautloft) made contact with the airmen and also spoke to Lamason. Convinced the airmen were not spies, but bona-fide airmen, Trautloft reported his findings to command.\n\nAfter reading the report, an outraged Hermann Göring demanded 'at the highest level' the transfer of the airmen to Luftwaffe control. Unknown to all airmen except Lamason, their execution had been scheduled for 26 October, if they remained at Buchenwald. News of the airmen's scheduled execution had been conveyed to Lamason by a German political prisoner, Eugen Kogon, who had a reliable contact within the camp administrative area. Lamason discussed the information at length with Yeo-Thomas, Burney and Robert and they concluded there was little that could be done to avert the mass execution. Lamason decided not to inform the airmen, but to keep this information to himself to keep morale high and in the slight hope the Luftwaffe would intervene in time. On the night of 19 October, seven days before their scheduled execution, 156 of the 168 airmen, including Lamason, were transferred from Buchenwald to Stalag Luft III by the Luftwaffe.\n\nTwo airmen died at Buchenwald. The other ten, who were too ill to be moved with the main group, were transported to Stalag Luft III in small groups over a period of several weeks. In the two months at Buchenwald, Lamason had lost 19 kilograms (42 lbs) and had contracted diphtheria and dysentery. At Stalag Luft III, he spent a month in the infirmary recovering. In late January 1945, all Stalag Luft III POWs were force-marched to other POW camps further inside Germany. Lamason and Chapman were marched to Stalag III-A outside Luckenwalde, where they remained until liberated by the Russian army at the end of the war in Europe. Lamason and Chapman were taken to Hildesheim airfield and flown to Brussels and then onto England.\n\nMany airmen credit their survival at Buchenwald to the leadership and determination of Lamason. Captured pilot Stratton Appleman stated that \"they were very fortunate to have Lamason as their leader\". Another airman, Joe Moser, stated that Lamason was a great leader whom he would have been glad to follow anywhere he asked. British pilot James Stewart described Lamason as \"a wonderful unsung hero\". In the book \"168 Jump into Hell\", Lamason was described as having single-minded determination, selflessness, cold courage and forcefulness in the face of the threat of execution by the camp authorities because he was their leader and said that Lamason quickly established himself as a legendary figure in the airmen's eyes. In the National Film Board of Canada 1994 documentary, \"The Lucky Ones: Allied Airmen and Buchenwald\", captured pilot Tom Blackham stated that Lamason was not only the senior officer, but also their natural leader. Lamason emerged from Buchenwald with a giant reputation. In the book \"Destination Buchenwald\", Lamason stated he felt deeply honoured to have been the senior officer during the Buchenwald period.\n\nFollowing their liberation and return to England, Lamason was asked to consider commanding one of the Okinawa squadrons for the final attack on Japan. However, the RNZAF refused and Lamason returned to New Zealand, arriving there the day after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. After the war, Lamason was discharged from the air force on 16 December 1945.\n\nIn 1946, Lamason was asked to be the lead pilot to test the flight paths for a new British airport. As part of the agreement, he was offered a farm in Berkshire. However, family said he needed to be home instead and Heathrow Airport went ahead without him. In 1948, Lamason moved to Dannevirke, a small rural community north east of Palmerston North where he acquired 406 acres and became a farmer until his retirement.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Lamason was a regular speaker at KLB (initials for Konzentrationslager Buchenwald) Club reunions, a club formed by the allied airmen while detained in Buchenwald. Lamason was also a member of the Caterpillar Club, an informal association of people who have successfully used a parachute to bail out of a disabled aircraft.\n\nLamason hid the fact for 39 years that the order for the airmen's execution was given and scheduled for 26 October 1944, first mentioning it at a Canadian POW convention in Hamilton in 1983. In May 1987, the New Zealand government in Wellington approved a fund to compensate servicemen held in German concentration camps and Lamason was awarded $13,000. However, Lamason was never formally honoured by his homeland for his leading role in saving the lives of the allied airmen at Buchenwald.\n\nIn 1994, the National Film Board of Canada released a documentary movie titled, “\"The Lucky Ones: Allied Airmen and Buchenwald\"”, in which former Allied airmen recounted their personal and collective stories of life before, during and after Buchenwald. Lamason was interviewed and mentioned throughout the documentary.\n\nLamason was portrayed in the History Channel’s 2004 documentary \"Shot from the Sky\", about the real life saga of B-17 pilot Roy Allen, one of the captured airmen taken to Buchenwald.\n\nIn April 2005, Lamason, then 86, recollected the events of Buchenwald on TV New Zealand. In June 2010, Lamason, then 91, was interviewed again about his experience at Buchenwald by Mike Dorsey. This and other interviews with Lamason are featured in Dorsey's 2011 documentary film titled, \"Lost Airmen of Buchenwald\", which tells the complete story of the 168 Allied airmen who were sent to Buchenwald, including Lamason. Mike Dorsey said Lamason remained scarred by his experiences to the extent that Dorsey said “I have a feeling that Lamason, to put it in a word, has no time for the Germans.”\n\nLamason died at his home on 19 May 2012, on the farm outside Dannevirke where he had lived for over 60 years. He was 93 and at the time of his death, survived by two sons and two daughters.

The quark epoch began approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, when the preceding electroweak epoch ended as the electroweak interaction separated into the weak interaction and electromagnetism. During the quark epoch the universe was filled with a dense, hot quark–gluon plasma, containing quarks, leptons and their antiparticles. Collisions between particles were too energetic to allow quarks to combine into mesons or baryons. The quark epoch ended when the universe was about 10 seconds old, when the average energy of particle interactions had fallen below the binding energy of hadrons. The following period, when quarks became confined within hadrons, is known as the hadron epoch.\n\n\n"}

The artist started his happening series in 2007 to protest against the addictions to new technologies. He asked the audience to give up their mobile phones and use them to create an assemblage. \n\nThe first action was held in the city of Znojmo. The spectators sewed the mobile phones directly on to the artist wearing a jacket with a train (the jacket then became the basis for new assemblage). \n\nThe second happening took place in public area – on the pavement of Mariahilfer Straße in Vienna in 2007. Kristek who likes to remove the barriers between art and reality, deliberately got with his action in the way of passers-by to pull them out of their stereotype and to force them adopt an attitude. The artist dipped the balerina’s pointe shoes into the paint and let her dance on a blank canvas. The pointe shoes also became part of the assemblage afterwards. Then he invited school pupils and passers-by to help to create the new assemblage, to paint and sew more mobile phones on to it. Art and life merged in the avant-garde sense.\n\nThe assemblage travelled to an exhibition at the Barockschloß Riegersburg, today Schloss Ruegers (2007). The artist continued to travel with his mission to other states. With each happening interaction the assemblage changed its shape.\n\nIn 2008, the happening series continued in the Neues Stadtmuseum, Landsberg am Lech. It was part of the retrospective exhibition of the works by Lubo Kristek titled \"Third Eye of Distant Communication\".\n\nThe following happening took place in a Polish city of Sucha Beskidzka in 2010. According to Kristek, the relationship of contemporary society to the mobile telephone bears the traits of a cult or even a pathological dependency. Therefore he places this “modern god” on the altar (with the inscription Rest in Peace) and lets a giant triple-breasted angel to drill it through. The participants of the happening actively contribute to the act of sacrificing the mobile phones.\n\n\"Requiem for Mobile Telephones\" belongs to Kristek’s critical assemblages as well as \"Soundproof Aesthetic of Luxuriety\" (1976) that reveals the traps of consume approach and \"In the Prematurely Cloned Age of One Planet\" (2003) that questiones the ethics of current medical science. \n\n\n"}

The company calls itself a global community where guests and artists come together to experience music in an intimate and respectful setting at a secret concert.\n\nThe events started in London in March 2009 by Rafe Offer, Rocky Start and Dave J. Alexander who went to a Friendly Fires concert and became annoyed by people talking over the music, gazing into their Smartphones or hearing the clanging of beer bottles. As a consequence, they decided to put on their own gig in Alexander's North London flat and invited eight friends over to listen to him play five songs in his living room.\n\nFor the second gig in London, more people showed up because the word had spread. Soon after, Sofar expanded (mostly by word of mouth) to Paris, New York City, and other cities, arriving in Los Angeles in early 2011.\n\nWhat started as a grassroots movement in London has eventually grown into a global community. In early 2017, Sofar Sounds claimed that they are putting on about 500 gigs per month in more than 300 cities worldwide.\n\nTypically, three artists perform at each Sofar gig with no \"opener\" and no \"headliner\". Performers apply to be considered via a form on the website. Musicians of all genres as well as spoken word poets, comedians and even dancers are welcome to apply. Local Sofar Sounds lead ambassadors / bookers and their review committees and music scouts curate the evenings.\n\nThe line-up for a concert is not disclosed until the event starts; the location (often a private living room with an average size of 70 people) is announced 24 hours before the show. Guests arrive on time for the first act and are encouraged to stay for the entire show. Events are normally BYOB, and emphasis is placed on the crowd being respectful – switching off their phones and listening. Sofar Sounds also claims that highlighting headline acts encourages people to turn up late and not respect the other performers, so that is why all artists are being treated equal.\n\nArtists are often filmed, with the edited video uploaded to the Sofar Sounds YouTube channel and shared on the website.\n\nThere are two types of Sofar cities: Full-time and volunteer/ambassador. The majority of Sofar cities are run by volunteers who put on one or two shows a month.\n\nIn the majority of Sofar Sounds cities the audience does not pay beforehand but is encouraged to make a cash contribution at the show. In some cities in the US and UK, people can choose how much they pay for their ticket prior to the show. The minimum amount is set by the local city team. In the rest of the Sofar cities, shows are ticketed. Tickets are $15 per person in the US, £18 in the UK, and 200kr in Norway.\n\nPerforming artists are either paid directly, or the A/V team on the night is paid to produce the video for the artists, depending on the compensation agreed upon between artist and booker.\n\nIn June 2015, Sofar Sounds partnered with Uber to host a series of secret gigs in London.\n\nIn July 2016 it was announced that Virgin Group's Sir Richard Branson would invest in Sofar Sounds.\n\nIn March 2017 a partnership with Airbnb for their new Music Experiences format was announced, which enables Airbnb customers in San Francisco to reserve seats at a Sofar event via the Trips platform.\n\nUK and Irish acts who have performed at Sofar shows include James Bay, Hozier, Emeli Sandé, Will Young, Tom Odell, Shura, Benjamin Clementine, actor Robert Pattinson, Wolf Alice, Bastille and Lianne La Havas. Both Bastille and Lianne La Havas performed at special events in London that Sofar put on in collaboration with the charity War Child. Bastille also took part in a special live-streamed Sofar Sounds #Voting show that was held in London in June 2016 to encourage people to vote in the EU referendum.\n\nSome US performers who have appeared in Sofar concerts include Giselle Bellas, Leon Bridges, Fantastic Negrito, Saba, X Ambassadors, Tank and the Bangas, Yeasayer and Yeah Yeah Yeahs front woman Karen O, while acts such as Núria Graham and Ali Somay have played Sofar Barcelona and Sofar Istanbul, respectively.\n\nThe local Sofar Sounds branch in Los Angeles also teamed up with the charity Movember for a Giving Tuesday event, while the New York City branch previously organized a gig in aid of Planned Parenthood.\n\nOn 20 June 2017 (World Refugee Day) Sofar Sounds announced a global event series called 'Give a Home', in partnership with Amnesty International. 'Give a Home' took place on 20 September 2017 and saw thousands of artists play intimate sets in living rooms in over 300 cities and 60 countries, in aid of the millions of refugees who were forced to flee their homes. Confirmed artists included Ed Sheeran, Moby, Gregory Porter, Daughter, Jesse & Joy, Hot Chip, Ludovico Einaudi, The National, Mashrou' Leila, and more.\n"}
{"id": "4376673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4376673", "title": "Stalin Note", "text": "Stalin Note\n\nThe Stalin Note, also known as the March Note, was a document delivered to the representatives of the Western allied powers (the United Kingdom, France, and the United States) from the Soviet Occupation in Germany on March 10, 1952. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin put forth a proposal for a reunification and neutralization of Germany, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for \"the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly\" and free activity of democratic parties and organizations.\n\nJames Warburg, member of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, testified before the committee on March 28, 1952 and observed that the Soviet proposal might be a bluff, but it seemed \"that our government is afraid to call the bluff for the fear that it may not be a bluff at all\" and might lead to \"a free, neutral, and demilitarized Germany\", which might be \"subverted into Soviet orbit\". This led to an exchange of notes between the Western allies and the Soviet Union, which eventually ended after the Western allies' insistence that a unified Germany should be free to join the European Defence Community and be rearmed, a demand which Stalin rejected.\n\nChancellor Konrad Adenauer and the Western allies at the time painted Stalin's move as an aggressive action that attempted to stall the reintegration of West Germany. However, afterwards there were debates on whether a chance for reunification had been missed. Six years after the exchange, two German ministers, Thomas Dehler and Gustav Heinemann, blamed Adenauer for not having explored the chance of reunification.\n\nAfter the end of the World War II, Germany was divided into what became eventually a Western and an Eastern Zone. By 1949, Germany had a parliamentary democracy in the West, called the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG – natively BRD, commonly \"West Germany\"), and a communist state in the East, called the German Democratic Republic (GDR – natively DDR, commonly \"East Germany\"). Opportunities for reunification of these two halves appeared unlikely from the Western standpoint because Stalin and the East German Communists did not want to allow any free elections in the GDR. The SED feared losing power if free elections were held. At that point in history, Germany had not yet signed a peace treaty for World War II because of the animosity between the three Western Powers and the Soviet Union. It would not sign one until the Two Plus Four Agreement in 1990.\n\nAt the beginning of 1950, the United States began negotiations for a peace treaty with Japan, which would also grant them military bases in Japan over a long period of time. This may have had an influence on Stalin's decision to support North Korea when it attacked South Korea, which was pro-US; however, this has not been proven. The Korean War (1950–1953) surprised the US and formed a deeper rift into the Cold War.\n\nIn discussions about the reunification, East Germany stressed the importance of a peace treaty, while West Germany focused on the importance of free elections for all of Germany. Chancellor Adenauer did not believe that reunification was possible under the given conditions. He and his administration pursued a course that allied the FRG with the Western Bloc, particularly in relationship to military policy. Specifically, Adenauer felt that the FRG should maintain an army, which could be integrated into a larger West European military force. A European Defence Community Treaty was signed in May 1952, after the rejection of the Stalin note, but the proposed European Defence Community never came into being, due to rejection of the treaty by the French National Assembly.\n\nStalin and the GDR condemned the EDC despite the fact that the GDR had created a pseudo-military force called the \"Kasernierte Volkspolizei\". The Stalin notes can be seen as a way of drawing out the propaganda efforts of East Germany so that the reunification would fail.\n\nOn September 15, 1951, the East German government offered to discuss holding elections at a meeting with West Germany. However, the West German government refused to hold talks with the SED because this would have meant the actual recognition of East Germany as an equal country. Contact was always maintained through the Western Powers. Instead, West Germany wanted a commission of the United Nations to check whether or not free all-German elections were possible.\n\nDue to the endeavors of the Western Powers, this commission met in December 1951. East Germany refused to let them enter, however. In their opinion, the possibility of free elections should be investigated by a commission of the four Occupying Powers.\n\nAt a conference in Paris, the SED emphasized the importance of the two German states discussing a potential peace treaty. The Soviet leadership also encouraged the discussion of a peace treaty with the Western Powers. The Soviet government continued along this trajectory because they were afraid of the Western push for the integration of the West German armed forces into a larger Western coalition.\n\nThe government of the GDR appealed to the four powers to allow for negotiations of the peace treaty for Germany. After about two months, in August 1951, Stalin was able to present the first draft of the plan for a peace treaty. After working through numerous corrections and basic conceptual changes, the final version was ready seven months later.\n\nOn March 10, 1952, Andrei Gromyko gave a diplomatic note about the solution of the \"German problem\" to representatives of the three western occupiers (the United States, Great Britain, and France) and called for a four-power conference. The note included the following points:\n\n\nThe FRG’s priorities were different from those of the GDR. Chancellor Adenauer’s main priority was the integration of the FRG into the West, and he saw reunification as a rather abstract goal. Specifically, his administration wanted to focus on the re-establishment of Germany into a capitalist Europe, and felt that reunification was not possible until West Germany was securely established in Western Europe. He went so far as to believe that a reunification could only happen at the same time as a radical change in eastern Europe. If the integration of West Germany into the Western Alliance could not be managed, West Germany would be pulled unavoidably in with the Soviet Union. He felt that Germany alone would not be able to afford an army which could provide for the security of a neutral Germany. Thus, Adenauer assumed that two German states would co-exist for an undeterminate amount of time and he followed this goal in the background. For these reasons, Adenauer saw the March note as an annoyance and wanted to continue proceedings with the Western Powers as if there had never been a note at all.\n\nAdenauer's view that Stalin's offer was not meant seriously was widely shared. But there were other views about how to react to the offer. The Minister of All-German Affairs, Jakob Kaiser, had a \"bridge theory,\" which suggested that Germany could be the mediator between East and West. While he agreed with Adenauer about the importance of free elections and the refusal of the Potsdam borders, he took the Soviet offer very seriously. In a radio address on March 12, 1952, Kaiser stated that the note had an important political significance, but he still thought it was important to approach it with caution. He asked that the suggestions of the Soviet Union be carefully explored so that no opportunity for reunification would be missed.\n\nSimilarly, other ministers and also members of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) felt that they should at least seriously test Stalin’s proposal so that the world public would not get the impression that reunification fell through because of West Germany. Also, this would quickly prove if Stalin really meant to keep his offer, and if he did not, then his deceit would be unmasked.\n\nHowever, Adenauer felt that a \"test\" would have significant disadvantages:\n\nAll in all, Adenauer, his ministers, the opposing Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and the population at large were in agreement: Stalin’s proposal was not sincere and the demand for free elections had to be maintained. However, there was still some uneasiness that the FRG could not do anything against the division of Germany.\n\nIn the GDR, the note was officially received with excitement. The party organ of the SED, \"Neues Deutschland\" (\"New Germany\"), gave it great importance \"for the battle of the patriotic forces of the German people and the peaceful reunification\", where patriotic forces meant principally communist forces.\n\nThe Prime Minister of the GDR, Otto Grotewohl, indicated how the draft treaty was interpreted by the GDR in a government declaration on March 14. In it, he described the GDR as a democratic and free state and the FRG as undemocratic and fascist. Anti-peace and anti-democratic groups, however, could not be allowed to exist in a united Germany. In addition, a united Germany had to orient themselves with the five-year plan of the GDR. Finally, Walter Ulbricht, the general secretary of the central committee of the SED, unmistakably spoke about the interpretation of the note. It should be understood as an action against the \"general war treaty\" (meaning the Germany treaty), through which Germany would become dependent on the West. However, Germany could only develop freely and peacefully in a communist, so-called \"world peace bloc\".\n\nThe Western Powers were not completely surprised by the proposition offered by the March note, because Stalin had not yet tried to interfere with the Western integration of the FRG. However, the Western Powers did not want to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union until West Germany was securely integrated into the West. Therefore, the response from the Western Powers attempted to delay the start of negotiations for the Peace Treaty.\n\nAfter the Foreign Ministers of the Western Occupation had finished their response, they asked Adenauer for his opinion on the matter, in case he had any small changes he wished to make. Although he mistrusted Stalin’s note, he asked that it not be outright rejected in the answering note. He didn't want to create the impression that the West had brusquely refused it.\n\nOn March 25, 1952, the first note from the governments of Great Britain, France, and the United States was sent to Moscow. It included the following points:\n\n\nIn the second Stalin Note, sent on April 9, 1952, the Soviet Union stood by its position that negotiations for the groundwork of a peace treaty and for the creation of a unified German government should begin. Stalin accepted that free elections could be the groundwork for a unified German government, but insisted that the four occupying powers oversee the elections rather than the United Nations. On the other hand, Stalin stayed firm on the idea that a reunified Germany should have the borders outlined by the Potsdam Conference, and that, even more generally, an armed Germany could not be in an alliance directed aggressively against other states.\n\nIn the second Western note of May 13, 1952, it was again emphasized that a freely-elected all-German government must participate in the treaty negotiations. Additionally, the West accepted that a commission of the occupying powers could oversee the elections, but insisted that the commission not be made up of government officials but rather impartial participants. The matter of dispute remained: free elections first (West) or peace treaty negotiations first (Soviet Union).\n\nA day before the official signing of the European Defence Community, the Soviet Union sent a third note, on May 24, 1952. In that note, Stalin criticized the creation of the EDC (which according to the Germany Treaty, should be in effect even after the reunification), and accused the Western Powers of delaying the negotiations for a peace treaty. In addition, the all-German government must remain under the control of the occupying powers at the treaty negotiations.\n\nOn their part, the West on July 10, 1952, criticized the centralization, the collectivization and the changes in the justice system of the GDR which the SED had previously passed. The note stated that the conference should not yet negotiate a peace treaty, but should decide about a commission to oversee the elections first. There was still a difference of opinion about whether the decisions of Potsdam could be the basis for negotiation - these decisions contradicted all the developments since 1945.\n\nOn August 23, 1952, the Soviet Union sent the last note. This note repeated their main positions and accusations. Additionally, although the Western Powers had conceded in allowing the occupying powers oversee the elections, the Soviet Union suddenly refused an international election commission entirely. Instead, both of the German states should be responsible for creating a commission with equal representation. However, this had already been refused by the West in 1951.\n\nFor this reason in their answer of September 23, 1952, the West limited themselves to repeating their previous views and to renewing the suggestion of forming a non-partisan commission of the four powers.\n\nIf after the first note of the West, the lack of success of the exchange of notes had already been internally determined, in the East as well as in the West, this view was also publicly expressed by the (rather polemic) contents of the last four notes. The signing of the two treaties with the West on May 26 and May 27, 1952, emphasized this even more.\n\nThere have been several debates about whether a real chance for reunification had been missed in 1952. There are two main disputes:\n\nAbove all, there is debate about the behavior of the FRG and the Western Powers. The publicist, Paul Sethe, and the historians Wilfried Loth, Josef Foschepoth, Karl-Gustav von Schönfels, and especially Rolf Steininger belong to the critics. Their views are answered by Hermann Graml, Gerhard Wettig, and Gottfried Niedhart.\n\nThe critics alleged again and again that Adenauer, who came from Catholic Rhineland, did not want reunification with the Protestant, Prussian East at all. The opinion of Adenauer in the Weimar Republic (he wanted an independent Rhineland inside of the German Empire) was used against him. Adenauer could have had a political motive: many of the traditional supporters of the SPD were in the GDR. With the East zone, Germany would have become more Protestant and more Social Democratic than the FRG of the three Western zones.\n\nIn essence, the debate had two peaks: at the end of the 1950s and then again after the opening of the archive of the Western Powers in the middle of the 1980s. Newer research since the 1990s also takes into account the archives of the former Eastern Bloc and thus brings up further discussion. Finally, a book on the analysis of the Stalin notes was published in 2002. During the reunification itself (1989–1990), the debate about the Stalin notes played no part.\n\nThe American historian Ruud van Dijk remarked that in the later discussions much more sincerity was attributed to Stalin than in 1952. The clearer it became that the chances for German reunification were dwindling, the stronger the debate about whether or not an important chance had been missed in 1952. According to Manfred Kittel, the discussion increased in extent as the chances for reunification decreased.\n\nWithin journalism, it was Paul Sethe who most sharply criticized Adenauer's non-acceptance of Stalin's offer. Sethe was the co-publisher of the \"Frankfurter Allgemeinen Zeitung\" in the beginning of the 1950s and had always spoken out in his commentaries for at least checking into the seriousness of Stalin's notes. Thus he saw the neutralization of Germany as an appropriate price for reunification. He completed the thesis of the \"missed chances\" in his book, \"Von Bonn nach Moskau\" (\"From Bonn to Moscow\") and thus he lay the cornerstone for a debate about the Stalin notes that lasted for decades.\n\nThe idea of the \"missed opportunity\" received attention through a debate in the Bundestag on January 23, 1958. The CDU/CSU had a government coalition with the small DP, when two former Ministers asked to speak, Thomas Dehler (FDP) and Gustav Heinemann (first CDU, now SPD). Both of them had left the government in the dispute with Adenauer at that time. They accused Chancellor Adenauer of not having done enough for reunification.\n\nThe debate came again in the 1980s, when the Western archives were opened for historians. The archives of the Soviet Union and the GDR were not yet accessible to researchers at that time. The historian, Rolf Steininger, asked in his article, \"Eine Chance zur Wiedervereinigung?\" (\"A Chance for Reunification?\") in 1985, which is based predominantly on Western sources, whether an important chance had been missed at that time. Steininger and others disputed the question whether it would have inevitably led to a divided Germany and whether the course of Adenauer was the best possible way. His argument is based on three assumptions:\n\n\nThe historian Hermann Graml, on the other hand, justified the actions of the Western Powers. Quite the opposite and also on the basis of the Western archives, he attached little importance to Adenauer's influence on the negotiation. Graml interpreted the note itself and the \"planned\" failure of the negotiations as more or less that the Soviet Union wanted to create an alibi for being able to push forward on the integration of the GDR into the Eastern Bloc.\n\n"}

These events marked the first time that FMW began a partnership with American counterpart Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and a working relationship began between the two companies as ECW wrestlers competed at these events and it marked the beginning of interpromotional matches and events between ECW and FMW. These events would create a huge impact in FMW's storylines as they concluded with the breakup of ZEN when Mr. Gannosuke, Yukihiro Kanemura and Hido attacked their leader Atsushi Onita out of jealousy after Hayabusa pinned Onita in a WarGames match. They merged with Fuyuki-Gun to form Team No Respect, which would dominate FMW until 2000.\n\nThe tour marked the beginning of a talent exchange working agreement between ECW and FMW which would last throughout the existence of both promotions. The theme of the tour was that ECW wrestlers would work matches on all of the shows on the tour. The tour also featured the return of FMW wrestlers, who were part of ECW roster at the time, Terry Funk and Sabu as ECW wrestlers. Funk had been the leader of Funk Masters of Wrestling and was returning the company for the first time since beating Kodo Fuyuki at Kawasaki Legend: Fall Spectacular and Sabu was returning since losing to Hayabusa at Summer Spectacular in 1994.\nAt Kawasaki Legend: Fall Spectacular, Atsushi Onita defeated W*ING Kanemura in a no rope barbed wire electrified dynamite land mine time bomb death match which stipulated that if Onita lost, he would retire and if Kanemura lost, then W*ING Alliance must disband. After the match, W*ING Alliance members Kanemura, Hideki Hosaka and Hido were concerned because no group in FMW would accept them. Onita became upset at FMW's team of Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and Koji Nakagawa for being rude to Kanemura, Hosaka and Hido and then he met Kanemura in his ambulance to conduct a meeting with the former W*ING members. On September 30, Onita held a press conference in which he turned villain for the first time in his FMW career by denouncing himself as a FMW wrestler and formed ZEN with the former W*ING Alliance and FMW's upstart Tetsuhiro Kuroda. A rivalry blossomed between FMW and ZEN and the Funk Masters of Wrestling was quickly phased out after Mr. Gannosuke, Hisakatsu Oya and The Gladiator ended it due to the group's leader Terry Funk leaving FMW and they joined ZEN. On November 20, Masato Tanaka, Ricky Fuji and Mr. Pogo #2 defeated ZEN's Atsushi Onita, Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hido in a six-man tag team match when Tanaka pinned Onita, leading to a match between the two on the first show of the Super Extreme Wrestling War tour on December 19.\n\nAt 8th Anniversary Show, Hayabusa defeated Mr. Gannosuke in a mask vs. hair match and then attempted to reconcile with Gannosuke but Gannosuke attacked him and attempted to blow fire on him until Hayabusa's ally Jinsei Shinzaki made the save, thus forming an alliance with Hayabusa and beginning to feud with Gannosuke. On June 21, Gannosuke attacked Shinzaki under a Hayabusa disguise during Shinzaki's entrance before a match at a Michinoku Pro Wrestling show. On July 19, Gannosuke, Hisakatsu Oya and The Gladiator defeated Hayabusa, Shinzaki and Koji Nakagawa in a six-man tag team match. On August 25, Gannosuke, Gladiator and Super Leather defeated the team of Shinzaki, Ricky Fuji and Ricky Morton in a barbed wire tornado deathmatch. On October 14, Gannosuke attacked Shinzaki from behind before a match between the two and then easily defeated him by making him bleed. On October 19, Gannosuke, along with Hisakatsu Oya left Funk Masters of Wrestling and joined ZEN after losing the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship to ZEN's Atsushi Onita and Yukihiro Kanemura. The title would be vacated due to Onita's inactivity. On November 28, Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura defeated Hayabusa and Masato Tanaka to win the vacant title. On December 5, Gannosuke stole Shinzaki's clothes and wore them during a tag team match pitting him and Hideki Hosaka against Shinzaki and Ricky Fuji, which Gannosuke and Hosaka won. This set up a title defense for Gannosuke and Kanemura against Hayabusa and Shinzaki on the December 19 show of the tour.\n\nOther important changes in the FMW roster took place in December as Hisakatsu Oya quit ZEN after losing to Hayabusa on December 5 and Koji Nakagawa walked out on FMW after feeling betrayed by Shoichi Arai for not been given major opportunities which had been promised to him in the past.\n\nThe first show of the Super Extreme Wrestling War took place on December 19, 1997 at the Komazawa Gymnasium in Tokyo, Japan. It was the first event in FMW history to host Extreme Championship Wrestling's (ECW) roster in FMW and marked the beginning of the talent exchange between FMW and ECW wrestlers which would see wrestlers from both companies appear in interpromotional matches. In the first match, Fuyuki-Gun (Kodo Fuyuki, Jado and Gedo) defeated ZEN members defeated Tetsuhiro Kuroda, Hido and The Great Fake when Fuyuki performed a Lariat on Hido. Aja Kong defeated Shark Tsuchiya with a \"Uraken\". D-Von Dudley from ECW defeated Ricky Fuji with a \"Dudley Death Drop\" from Dudley Boyz and ZEN's The Gladiator defeated ECW's Tommy Dreamer with a \"Super Awesome Bomb\". The event marked the return of the former leader of Funk Masters of Wrestling Terry Funk to FMW as an ECW wrestler. He defeated The Sandman and Buh Buh Ray Dudley in a three-way dance. Mr. Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura retained the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship against Hayabusa and Jinsei Shinzaki when Kanemura hit a diving Hayabusa in his injured ribs with his knee and then rolled him up to win the match. The main event of the show featured the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Champion and the Independent Heavyweight Champion Masato Tanaka competing against ZEN leader Atsushi Onita in a non-title match, stemming from Tanaka pinning Onita in a match. Onita defeated Tanaka in the match. A dissension took place within ZEN as Onita booked himself in the main event while Mr. Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura grew upset as they thought that their FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship match deserved to be the main event of the show as they had become popular villains of FMW. A clash occurred within ZEN.\n\nThe second show of the tour took place on December 20, 1997 at the Osaka Seaside Sports Center in Osaka, Japan. It drew an attendance of 3,600. In the opening match, Ricky Fuji defeated Flying Kid Ichihara with a Brainbuster. Kaori Nakayama and Miwa Sato defeated Toxic Corps (Crusher Maedomari and Miss Mongol) when Nakayama pinned Mongol with a la magistral, leading to a rematch between the two teams on the next show. Jinsei Shinzaki made Mr. Pogo #2 submit to a \"Gokuraku-gatame\". Fuyuki-Gun leader Kodo Fuyuki continued his rivalry with ZEN by defeating ZEN member Hideki Hosaka as The Great Fake, with a running lariat. Extreme Championship Wrestling's (ECW) Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D-Von) fought Jado and Gedo to a no contest. ZEN's The Gladiator, Mr. Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura defeated ECW's Terry Funk, The Sandman and Tommy Dreamer when Gannosuke pinned his former Funk Masters of Wrestling leader Funk with a \"Gannosuke Clutch\". In the main event, Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka and former ZEN member Hisakatsu Oya defeated ZEN's Atsushi Onita, Tetsuhiro Kuroda and Hido to win the FMW World Street Fight 6-Man Tag Team Championship.\n\nThe third show took place on December 21, 1997 at the Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium in Nagoya, Aichi, Japan. The event drew a crowd of 4,350 people. Hideki Hosaka defeated newcomer Yoshinori Sasaki by making him submit to a one-legged Boston crab. Toxic Corps (Crusher Maedomari and Miss Mongol) defeated Kaori Nakayama and Miwa Sato in a rematch from the previous show when Maedomari delivered a \"Nodowa Otoshi\" to Sato. Jinsei Shinzaki gained a submission victory over Flying Kid Ichihara with a \"Gokuraku-gatame\". Fuyuki-Gun (Kodo Fuyuki, Jado and Gedo) defeated the FMW team of Hayabusa, Ricky Fuji and Mr. Pogo #2 when Fuyuki delivered a running lariat to Pogo #2. Mr. Gannosuke defeated his former tag team partner Hisakatsu Oya with a \"Gannosuke Clutch\". Extreme Championship Wrestling's (ECW) Terry Funk, The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer and Dudley Boyz took on ZEN's Hido, Tetsuhiro Kuroda, The Gladiator, Atsushi Onita and The Great Fake in an interpromotional match which Funk won by pinning Hido with a small package. In the main event, Masato Tanaka successfully defended the FMW Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and the FMW Independent Heavyweight Championship against ZEN's Yukihiro Kanemura by performing a \"Roaring Elbow\".\n\nThe final show of the Super Extreme Wrestling War tour took on December 22, 1997 at the historic Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Japan. The show drew a crowd of 2,150 and marked the conclusion of Extreme Championship Wrestling's (ECW) tour in FMW. Mr. Pogo #2 defeated Yoshinori Sasaki in the opening match with a body scissors. Miss Mongol and Miwa Sato competed in a match after exchanging wins in tag team matches during the previous two shows. Mongol won the match with a diving senton. Former Brass Knuckles Tag Team Champions Hisakatsu Oya and Ricky Fuji teamed with each other as FMW members for the first time in over a year in an unofficial reunion against ZEN's Tetsuhiro Kuroda and The Great Fake. Fake pinned Fuji with a small package. ECW had an exhibition match in which former FMW wrestler Sabu returned to the company, having competed for the last time in a loss to Hayabusa at Summer Spectacular in 1994. He defeated The Sandman with an \"Arabian Facebuster\". Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer defeated Dudley Boyz and ZEN members The Gladiator and Hido in a three-Way dance. The main event was an important match in FMW history as it concluded the rivalry between FMW and ZEN. Hayabusa, Jinsei Shinzaki and Masato Tanaka took on ZEN's Atsushi Onita, Mr. Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura in a WarGames barbed wire baseball bat ladder cage match. Gannosuke and Kanemura separated themselves from Onita and did not help him throughout the match and Hayabusa won it by performing a Moonsault from the top of the steel cage, which he had failed to execute during his match against Onita at the 6th Anniversary Show. After the match, Gannosuke and Kanemura attacked Onita until Koji Nakagawa made the rescue for him and forced Gannosuke and Kanemura to retreat and quit ZEN, along with Hido.\n\nKoji Nakagawa was added into ZEN for helping Atsushi Onita to fend off the attack of Mr. Gannosuke and Yukihiro Kanemura and ZEN ended their feud with FMW and focused on feuding with the new freelance trio of Gannosuke, Kanemura and Hido. On January 6, 1998, Gannosuke defeated Masato Tanaka to win the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship and the Independent Heavyweight Championship. The following night, ZEN promoted its first show, modeled after nWo Souled Out, which was headlined by ZEN's Onita, Nakagawa and Tetsuhiro Kuroda defeating Gannosuke, Kanemura and Hido. After the match, Gannoskue, Kanemura and Hido attacked ZEN and Fuyuki-Gun joined them in the assault and the two groups merged to form Team No Respect, which became the lead heel stable in FMW. Hayabusa won a tournament to become the #1 contender for the Double Championship and defeated Gannosuke for the title at the 9th Anniversary Show while Onita lost to TNR member Kodo Fuyuki.\n\n"}

It was published by Tyndale House Publishers in 2010 and lists Alex's father Kevin Malarkey as an author along with Alex, although Alex described it in November 2012 as \"one of the most deceptive books ever.\" It was adapted into a TV movie in March 2010.\n\nAlex forcefully disavowed the book in an open letter to Christian bookstores almost five years after it was published and more than a million copies were sold, describing his near-death experience as a fabrication. As a result, Tyndale House removed the book from print, and Christian bookstores removed it from their shelves.\n\nAlex had suffered various injuries in the accident, including a severe spinal injury, severe neck injuries, and brain trauma, and he was left a quadriplegic.\n\nAccording to his own account, Alex Malarkey says that he and his father were driving on a highway near Rushsylvania, Ohio when his father turned onto another road, and was hit by a car, which he did not see behind a blind hill. After the automobile accident, he says he saw his father fly out of the window of his car, only to be caught by an angel and carried to safety. He says he was out of his body while he saw this happen. His body was taken to a hospital in an emergency helicopter. The book says that soon after that he felt an angel take him through the gates of Heaven, which he describes as being \"tall,\" to meet Jesus, who appears through a \"hole in heaven.\" After he woke up in the hospital, he told his family his account of his near-death experience. Tyndale House promoted the book as \"a supernatural encounter that will give you new insights on Heaven, angels, and hearing the voice of God.\"\n\nBooks about purported visits to Heaven make up a popular and highly lucrative genre of religious books in the United States. The 2004 book \"90 Minutes in Heaven\" spent over five years on the New York Times best-seller list, and sold over six million copies, while the book \"Heaven Is for Real\" has sold over 10 million copies and the film adaptation earned $101 million at the box office. \"The Boy Who Came Back from Heaven\" sold 112,386 copies in the first year, and received a platinum award from the Evangelical Christian Publishers Association in 2013 for over a million sales.\n\nIn November 2012, Alex's mother, Beth Malarkey, wrote several blog posts saying that her family is not in agreement with the content of the book. She expressed frustration with several people calling and visiting their home over the years, saying, \"[Alex] is just a boy not a statue to be worshipped or person with some supernatural gifts,\" and, \"He does not go to Heaven, have conversations with supernatural beings, and whatever visions/experiences he has had or had not had, is up to him as to what he will do with those.\" Later that month, she claimed the book's account had been embellished, adding that, \"The truth is getting twisted, distorted, and packaged to be sold to the highest bidder.\" She also revealed that Alex himself had written a comment on the book's Facebook page in November 2011 calling the book \"one of the most deceptive books ever.\" That comment was deleted, and Alex was banned from commenting after the moderators suspected he was an imposter. Beth and Kevin Malarkey have become estranged since the book was published.\n\nOn May 9, 2014, Beth Malarkey appeared on the Christian radio show, \"The Bible Answer Man,\" and said that the book is deceptive and embellishes the story of the accident. Beth Malarkey said Alex is still a quadriplegic and cannot legally receive any money from the book. She also began communicating with Phil Johnson, the executive director of John F. MacArthur's media ministry, \"Grace to You,\" in hopes of communicating her story. Johnson said that Beth had told him she and Alex had been trying to publicize for some time that the book was \"an exaggeration and an embellishment.\" Johnson subsequently revealed in his blog, \"The Spurgeon Archive,\" that Beth Malarkey had sent Tyndale \"a stack of correspondence\" in which she stated that Alex not only received no royalties from the book, but that Kevin \"neglects his duties as a husband and a father,\" and was \"not even adequately supporting his family financially.\" She had also revealed this to apologist Justin Peters, who proceeded to e-mail LifeWay leaders Ed Stetzer and Thom S. Rainer. They responded, but the book would not be withdrawn from LifeWay stores for another eight months \n\nAccording to psychologist and paranormal researcher Benjamin Radford, part of the reason that the story was so well-received and accepted among its American Christian audience is that it reinforced their existing narratives and beliefs. By sticking closely to a widely accepted interpretation of heaven, God and demons, Malarkey was assured that his story would meet his audience’s expectations and be popular.\n\nOn January 13, 2015, Alex Malarkey released an open letter to Christian publishers and bookstores via the Christian Apologetics blog known as \"Pulpit and Pen\", confessing that the entire account of his journey to Heaven was fictional, and implored them to remove the book from their stores. In his letter he notes:\nOn January 15, 2015, Tyndale House confirmed it would be withdrawing the book.\n\nIn 2009, Alex Malarkey, aged 10, became the youngest person to have the surgical procedure first carried out for Christopher Reeve to allow him to breathe on his own without a ventilator. Later in 2009, he was able to stand upright in a supporting frame and, with helpers moving his legs, to walk on a treadmill.\n\n\n"}

The New American Cinema Group is an artist-run, non-profit organization founded in 1962 in New York City by Jonas Mekas, Shirley Clarke, Stan Brakhage, Gregory Markopoulos, Lloyd Michael Williams and other filmmakers to distribute avant-garde films.\n\nIn the fall of 1960, Jonas Mekas and Lewis Allen organized several meetings with independent filmmakers in New York City that culminated on September 28, 1960 with them officially declaring themselves the New American Cinema Group. Two days later on Sept. 30, Mekas presented the first draft of a manifesto for the Group, which included a call to form a cooperative distribution center.\n\nOn January 7, 1961, at a contentious meeting of the Group, Amos Vogel attempted to stonewall the formation of the distribution center claiming that his own Cinema 16 organization should be the only distributor of experimental films. However, Vogel is shouted down after it was pointed out that Cinema 16 refused to distribute Stan Brakhage's \"Anticipation of the Night\".\n\nThe Film-Makers' Cooperative would officially start distributing films in 1962.\n\nThe Film-Makers' Cooperative holds the world's largest collection of avantgarde and experimental films, with over 5,000 titles by more than 825 filmmakers. The collection includes work authored on 35mm, 16mm, 8mm, video and DVD. The Cooperative rents out the films in its collection to cinématheques, film festivals, schools, universities, museums, and other art institutions in the United States and around the world.\n\nBased upon a belief common to the founding members that the \"official cinema is running out of breath\" and has become \"morally corrupt, aesthetically obsolete, thematically superficial, temperamentally boring\" (as the original 1962 manifesto would have it), the Film-Makers' Cooperative was a key institution in the heyday of American experimental or \"underground\" film in the 1960s and 1970s, and has continued to operate on a non-exclusive basis to ensure the existence of an alternative, non-commercial film culture since then.\n\nThe Film-Makers' Cooperative is open to anyone who wishes to become a member.\n\nThe New York Film-Makers' Cooperative has inspired similar initiatives both within the United States (Canyon Cinema in San Francisco) and abroad (The London Film-Makers' Co-operative in England, and ABCinema in Denmark, and elsewhere).\n\nBesides distributing its members' films, the Film-Makers' Cooperative is continuously involved in film preservation and DVD release projects, and in arranging screenings and events in and around New York City.\n\nFounding Director: Jonas Mekas<br>\nExecutive Director: M.M.

{"id": "30770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30770", "title": "The Troubles", "text": "The Troubles\n\nThe Troubles () was an ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, and the Conflict in Ireland, it is sometimes described as a \"guerrilla war\" or a \"low-level war\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles primarily took place in Northern Ireland, at times the violence spilled over into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England, and mainland Europe.\n\nThe conflict was primarily political and nationalistic, fuelled by historical events. It also had an ethnic or sectarian dimension, although it was not a religious conflict. A key issue was the constitutional status of Northern Ireland. Unionists/loyalists, who were mostly Protestants, wanted Northern Ireland to remain within the United Kingdom. Irish nationalists/republicans, who were mostly Catholics, wanted Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and join a united Ireland.\n\nThe conflict began during a campaign to end discrimination against the Catholic/nationalist minority by the Protestant/unionist government and police force. The authorities attempted to suppress this protest campaign and were accused of police brutality; it was also met with violence from loyalists, who alleged it was a republican front. Increasing inter-communal violence, and conflict between nationalist youths and police, eventually led to riots in August 1969 and the deployment of British troops. Some Catholics initially welcomed the army as a more neutral force, but it soon came to be seen as hostile and biased. The emergence of armed paramilitary organisations led to the subsequent warfare over the next three decades.\n\nThe main participants in the Troubles were republican paramilitaries such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA); loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA); British state security forces – the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC); and political activists and politicians. The security forces of the Republic played a smaller role. Republican paramilitaries carried out a guerrilla campaign against the British security forces, as well as a bombing campaign against infrastructure, commercial and political targets. Loyalists targeted republicans/nationalists, and attacked the wider Catholic community in what they claimed was retaliation. At times there were bouts of sectarian tit-for-tat violence. The British security forces undertook both a policing and a counter-insurgency role, primarily against republicans. There were some incidents of collusion between British security forces and loyalists. The Troubles also involved numerous riots, mass protests and acts of civil disobedience, and led to segregation and the creation of no-go areas.\n\nMore than 3,500 people were killed in the conflict, of whom 52% were civilians, 32% were members of the British security forces, and 16% were members of paramilitary groups. There has been sporadic violence since the Good Friday Agreement was signed, including a campaign by anti-ceasefire republicans.\n\n\"The Troubles\" refers to the three-decade conflict between nationalists (mainly self-identified as Irish or Roman Catholic) and unionists (mainly self-identified as\nBritish or Protestant). The term \"Troubles\" had previously been used in conjunction with the 17th century Wars of the Three Kingdoms, \nas well as to describe the Irish revolutionary period in the early twentieth century.\nIt was subsequently adopted to refer to the escalating violence in Northern Ireland after 1969. The violence was characterised by the armed campaigns of Irish republican and Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups and British state security forces (the British Army and the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)). It thus became the focus for the longest major campaign in the history of the British Army.\n\nThe British government's position is that its forces were neutral in the conflict, trying to uphold law and order in Northern Ireland and the right of the people of Northern Ireland to democratic self-determination. Nationalists regard the state forces as forces of occupation or partisan combatants in the conflict. The British security forces focused on republican paramilitaries and activists, and the \"Ballast\" investigation by the Police Ombudsman confirmed that British forces colluded on several occasions with loyalist paramilitaries, were involved in murder, and furthermore obstructed the course of justice when claims of collusion and murder were investigated.\n\nThe Troubles were brought to an uneasy end by a peace process that included the declaration of ceasefires by most paramilitary organisations, the complete decommissioning of the IRA's weapons, the reform of the police, and the corresponding withdrawal of the British Army from the streets and sensitive Irish border areas such as South Armagh and Fermanagh, as agreed by the signatories to the Belfast Agreement (commonly known as the \"Good Friday Agreement\"). One part of the Agreement is that Northern Ireland will remain within the United Kingdom unless a majority of the Northern Irish electorate vote otherwise. It also established the Northern Ireland Executive, a devolved power-sharing government, which must consist of both unionist and nationalist parties.\n\nAlthough the number of active participants was relatively small, the Troubles affected many in Northern Ireland on a daily basis; their impact sometimes spread to England and the Republic of Ireland, and, occasionally, to parts of mainland Europe.\n\nIn 1609, Scottish and English settlers, known as \"planters\", were given land escheated from the native Irish in the Plantation of Ulster. Coupled with Protestant immigration to \"unplanted\" areas of Ulster, particularly Antrim and Down, this resulted in conflict between the native Catholics and the \"planters\", leading in turn to two bloody religious conflicts known as the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–1653) and the Williamite war (1689–1691), both of which resulted in Protestant victories.\n\nAnglican dominance in Ireland was ensured by the passage of the Penal Laws that curtailed the religious, legal, and political rights of anyone (including both Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, such as Presbyterians) who did not conform to the state church, the Anglican Church of Ireland. As the Penal Laws started to be phased out in the latter part of the 18th century, there was more competition for land, as restrictions were lifted on the Irish Catholic ability to rent. With Roman Catholics allowed to buy land and enter trades from which they had formerly been banned, tensions arose resulting in the Protestant \"Peep O'Day Boys\" and Catholic \"Defenders\". This created polarisation between the communities and a dramatic reduction in reformers among Protestants, many of whom had been growing more receptive to democratic reform.\n\nFollowing the foundation of the republican Society of the United Irishmen by Presbyterians, Catholics, and liberal Anglicans, and the resulting failed Irish Rebellion of 1798, sectarian violence between Catholics and Protestants continued. The Orange Order (founded 1795), with its stated goal of upholding the Protestant faith and loyalty to the heirs of William of Orange, dates from this period and remains active to this day.\n\nWith the 1801 Act of Union, a new political framework was formed with the abolition of the Irish Parliament and incorporation of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The result was a closer tie between Anglicans and the formerly republican Presbyterians as part of a \"loyal\" Protestant community. Although Catholic Emancipation was achieved in 1829, largely eliminating official discrimination against Roman Catholics (then around 75% of Ireland's population), Dissenters, and Jews, the Repeal Association's campaign to repeal the 1801 Union failed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the Home Rule movement was created and served to define the divide between most nationalists (usually Catholics), who sought the restoration of an Irish Parliament, and most unionists (usually Protestants), who were afraid of being a minority under a Catholic-dominated Irish Parliament and who tended to support continuing union with Britain.\n\nUnionists and Home Rule advocates were the main political factions in late 19th- and early 20th-century Ireland.\n\nBy the second decade of the 20th century, Home Rule, or limited Irish self-government, was on the brink of being conceded due to the agitation of the Irish Parliamentary Party. \nIn response to the campaign for Home Rule which started in the 1870s, unionists, mostly Protestant and largely concentrated in Ulster, had resisted both self-government and independence for Ireland, fearing for their future in an overwhelmingly Catholic country dominated by the Roman Catholic Church. In 1912, unionists led by Edward Carson signed the Ulster Covenant and pledged to resist Home Rule by force if necessary. To this end, they formed the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).\n\nIn response, nationalists led by Eoin MacNeill formed the Irish Volunteers, whose goal was to oppose the UVF and ensure enactment of the Third Home Rule Bill in the event of British or unionist recalcitrance. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and Ireland's involvement in the war temporarily averted possible civil war in Ireland and delayed the resolution of the question of Irish independence. Home Rule, although passed in the British Parliament with Royal Assent, was suspended for the duration of the war.\n\nThe Irish Volunteers split, with a majority, called National Volunteers, joining Irish regiments of the New British Army. Many of those who stayed were radical nationalists, among them Irish Republican Brotherhood infiltrators. From these ranks came those who launched the Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, led by Padraig Pearse and James Connolly. Two and a half years after the executions of fifteen of the Rising's leaders, the separatist Sinn Féin party won the December 1918 Irish general election with 48% of the vote and a majority of seats, and set up the 1919 First Dáil (Irish Parliament) in Dublin. Their victory was aided by the threat of conscription for First World War service. The Irish War for Independence followed, leading to eventual independence in 1922 for the Irish Free State, which comprised 26 of the 32 Irish counties. In Ulster, particularly in the six counties which became Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin fared relatively poorly in the 1918 election, and unionists won a majority.\n\nThe Government of Ireland Act 1920 partitioned the island of Ireland into two separate jurisdictions, Southern Ireland and Northern Ireland, both devolved regions of the United Kingdom. This partition of Ireland was confirmed when the Parliament of Northern Ireland exercised its right in December 1922 under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 to \"opt out\" of the newly established Irish Free State. A part of the treaty signed in 1922 mandated that a boundary commission would sit to decide where the frontier of the northern state would be in relation to its southern neighbour. After the Irish Civil War of 1922–1923, this part of the treaty was given less priority by the new Dublin government led by W. T. Cosgrave, and was quietly dropped. As counties Fermanagh and Tyrone and border areas of Londonderry, Armagh, and Down were mainly nationalist, the Irish Boundary Commission could reduce Northern Ireland to four counties or less.\n\nNorthern Ireland remained a part of the United Kingdom, albeit under a separate system of government whereby it was given its own parliament and devolved government. While this arrangement met the desires of unionists to remain part of the United Kingdom, nationalists largely viewed the partition of Ireland as an illegal and arbitrary division of the island against the will of the majority of its people. They argued that the Northern Ireland state was neither legitimate nor democratic, but created with a deliberately gerrymandered unionist majority. Catholics initially composed about 35% of its population. A total of 557 people, mostly Catholics, were killed in political or sectarian violence from 1920 to 1922 in the six counties that would become Northern Ireland, both during and after the Irish War of Independence. The result was communal strife between Catholics and Protestants, with some historians describing this violence, especially that in Belfast, as a pogrom, although historian Peter Hart argues that the term is not appropriate given the reciprocity of violence in Northern Ireland.\n\nA marginalised remnant of the Irish Republican Army survived the Irish Civil War. This would come to have a major impact on Northern Ireland. Although the IRA was proscribed on both sides of the new Irish border, it remained ideologically committed to overthrowing both the Northern Ireland and the Free State governments by force of arms to unify Ireland. The government of Northern Ireland passed the Special Powers Act in 1922, giving sweeping powers to the government and police to do virtually anything seen as necessary to re-establish or preserve law and order. The Act continued to be used against nationalists long after the violence of this period had come to an end.\n\nThe two sides' positions became strictly defined following this period. From a unionist perspective, Northern Ireland's nationalists were inherently disloyal and determined to force unionists into a united Ireland. This threat was seen as justifying preferential treatment of unionists in housing, employment and other fields. The prevalence of larger families and thus the potential for a more rapid population growth among Catholics was seen as a threat. Unionist governments ignored Edward Carson's warning in 1921 that alienating Catholics would make Northern Ireland inherently unstable. After the early 1920s, there were occasional incidents of sectarian unrest in Northern Ireland. These included severe rioting in Belfast in the 1930s and 1950s, and the IRA's brief Northern Campaign in the 1940s and Border Campaign between 1956 and 1962, which did not enjoy broad popular support among nationalists. After the IRA called off its campaign in 1962, Northern Ireland became relatively stable for a brief period.\n\nThere is little agreement on the exact date of the start of the Troubles. Different writers have suggested different dates. These include the formation of the modern Ulster Volunteer Force in 1966, the civil rights march in Derry on 5 October 1968, the beginning of the 'Battle of the Bogside' on 12 August 1969 or the deployment of British troops on 14 August 1969.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, a non-violent civil rights campaign began in Northern Ireland. It comprised groups such as the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ), the Derry Citizens' Action Committee (DCAC) and People's Democracy, whose stated goals were:\n\nSome suspected and accused NICRA of being a republican front-group whose ultimate goal was to unite Ireland. Although republicans and some members of the IRA (then led by Cathal Goulding and pursuing a non-violent agenda) helped to create and drive the movement, they did not control it and were not a dominant faction within it.\n\nIn March and April 1966, Irish nationalists/republicans held parades throughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. On 8 March, a group of Irish republicans dynamited Nelson's Pillar in Dublin. At the time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists warned it was about to be revived to launch another campaign against Northern Ireland. In April 1966, loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC). It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV) to oust Terence O'Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Although O'Neill was a unionist, they viewed him as being too 'soft' on the civil rights movement and opposed his policies.\nAt the same time, a loyalist group calling itself the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) emerged in the Shankill area of Belfast. It was led by Gusty Spence, a former British soldier. Many of its members were also members of the UCDC and UPV. In April and May it petrol bombed a number of Catholic homes, schools and businesses. A firebomb killed an elderly Protestant widow, Matilda Gould. On 21 May, the UVF issued a statement declaring \"war\" against the IRA and anyone helping it. On 27 May the UVF fatally shot a Catholic civilian, John Scullion, as he walked home. A month later it shot three Catholic civilians as they left a pub, killing a young Catholic from the Republic, Peter Ward. Shortly after, the UVF was proscribed (made illegal) by the Northern Ireland government. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) was formed in January 1967.\n\nOn 20 June 1968, civil rights activists (including Austin Currie, a nationalist MP) protested against housing discrimination by squatting in a house in Caledon. The local council had allocated the house to an unmarried 19-year-old Protestant (Emily Beattie, the secretary of a local UUP politician) instead of either of two large Catholic families with children. RUC officers – one of whom was Beattie's brother – forcibly removed the activists. Two days before the protest, the two Catholic families who had been squatting in the house next door were removed by police. Currie had brought their grievance to the local council and to Stormont, but had been told to leave. The incident invigorated the civil rights movement.\nOn 24 August 1968, the civil rights movement held its first civil rights march, from Coalisland to Dungannon. Many more marches were held over the following year. Loyalists (especially members of the UPV) attacked some of the marches and held counter-demonstrations in a bid to get the marches banned. Because of the lack of police reaction to the attacks, nationalists saw the RUC, almost wholly Protestant, as backing the loyalists and allowing the attacks to occur. On 5 October 1968, a civil rights march in Derry was banned by the Northern Ireland government. When marchers defied the ban, RUC officers surrounded the marchers and beat them indiscriminately and without provocation. More than 100 people were injured, including a number of nationalist politicians. The incident was filmed by television news crews and shown around the world. It caused outrage among Catholics and nationalists, sparking two days of rioting in Derry between nationalists and the RUC.\n\nA few days later, a student civil rights group – People's Democracy – was formed in Belfast. In late November, O'Neill promised the civil rights movement some concessions, but these were seen as too little by nationalists and too much by loyalists. On 1 January 1969, People's Democracy began a four-day march from Belfast to Derry, which was repeatedly harassed and attacked by loyalists. At Burntollet Bridge the marchers were attacked by about 200 loyalists, including some off-duty police officers, armed with iron bars, bricks and bottles in a pre-planned ambush. When the march reached Derry City it was again attacked. The marchers claimed that police did nothing to protect them and that some officers helped the attackers. That night, RUC officers went on a rampage in the Bogside area of Derry, attacking Catholic homes, attacking and threatening residents, and hurling sectarian abuse. Residents then sealed off the Bogside with barricades to keep the police out, creating \"Free Derry\", which was briefly a no-go area for the security forces.\n\nIn March and April 1969, loyalists bombed water and electricity installations in Northern Ireland, blaming them on the dormant IRA and elements of the civil rights movement. Some attacks left much of Belfast without power and water. Loyalists hoped the bombings would force O'Neill to resign and bring an end to any concessions to nationalists. There were six bombings between 30 March and 26 April. All were widely blamed on the IRA, and British soldiers were sent to guard installations. Unionist support for O'Neill waned, and on 28 April he resigned as Prime Minister.\n\nOn 19 April there were clashes between NICRA marchers, the RUC and loyalists in the Bogside. RUC officers entered the house of Samuel Devenny (42), an uninvolved Catholic civilian, and ferociously beat him along with two of his teenage daughters and a family friend. One of the daughters was beaten unconscious as she lay recovering from surgery. Devenny suffered a heart attack and died on 17 July from his injuries. On 13 July, RUC officers beat a Catholic civilian, Francis McCloskey (67), during clashes in Dungiven. He died of his injuries the next day.\n\nOn 12 August, the loyalist Apprentice Boys of Derry were allowed to march along the edge of the Bogside. Taunts and missiles were exchanged between the loyalists and nationalist residents. After being bombarded with stones and petrol bombs from nationalists, the RUC, backed by loyalists, tried to storm the Bogside. The RUC used CS gas, armoured vehicles and water cannons, but were kept at bay by hundreds of nationalists. The continuous fighting, which became known as the Battle of the Bogside, lasted for two days.\n\nIn response to events in Derry, nationalists held protests at RUC bases in Belfast and elsewhere. Some of these led to clashes with the RUC and attacks on RUC bases. In Belfast, loyalists responded by invading nationalist districts, burning houses and businesses. There were gun battles between nationalists and the RUC, and between nationalists and loyalists. A group of about 30 IRA members was involved in the fighting in Belfast. The RUC deployed Shorland armoured cars mounted with heavy Browning machine guns. The Shorlands twice opened fire on a block of flats in a nationalist district, killing a nine-year-old boy, Patrick Rooney. RUC officers opened fire on rioters in Armagh, Dungannon and Coalisland.\n\nDuring the riots, on 13 August, Taoiseach Jack Lynch made a television address. He condemned the RUC and said that the Irish Government \"can no longer stand by and see innocent people injured and perhaps worse\". He called for a United Nations peacekeeping force to be deployed and said that Irish Army field hospitals were being set up at the border in County Donegal near Derry. Lynch added that Irish re-unification would be the only permanent solution. Some interpreted the speech as a threat of military intervention. After the riots, Lynch ordered the Irish Army to plan for a possible humanitarian intervention in Northern Ireland. The plan, Exercise Armageddon, was rejected and remained classified for thirty years.\n\nOn 14–15 August, British troops were deployed in Derry and Belfast to restore order, but did not try to enter the Bogside, bringing a temporary end to the riots. Eight people had been shot dead, more than 750 had been injured (including 133 who suffered gunshot wounds) and more than 400 homes and businesses had been destroyed (83% Catholic-owned). 1,505 Catholic and 315 Protestant families were forced to flee their homes. The Irish Army set up refugee camps in the Republic near the border. Nationalists initially welcomed the British Army, as they did not trust the RUC. Despite the British government's attempt to do \"nothing that would suggest partiality to one section of the community\" and the improvement of the relationship between the Army and the local population following the Army assistance with flood relief in August 1970, the Falls curfew and a situation that was described at the time as \"an inflamed sectarian one, which is being deliberately exploited by the IRA and other extremists\" meant that relations between the Catholic population and the British Army rapidly deteriorated .\n\nAfter the riots, the 'Hunt Committee' was set up to examine the RUC. It published its report on 12 October, recommending that the RUC become an unarmed force and the B Specials be disbanded. That night, loyalists took to the streets of Belfast in protest at the report. During violence in the Shankill, UVF members shot dead RUC officer Victor Arbuckle. He was the first RUC officer to be killed during the Troubles. In October and December 1969, the UVF carried out a number of small bombings in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIn 1970 through 1972 an explosion of political violence occurred in Northern Ireland. The violence peaked in 1972, when nearly 500 people, just over half of them civilians, lost their lives, the worst year in the entire conflict.\n\nBy the end of 1971, 29 barricades were in place in Derry, blocking access to what was known as Free Derry; 16 of these were impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles. Many of the nationalist/republican \"no-go areas\" were controlled by one of the two factions of the Irish Republican Army—the Provisional IRA and Official IRA. There are several reasons offered for why violence escalated in these years.\n\nUnionists claim the main reason was the formation of the Provisional IRA and Official IRA, particularly the former. These two groups were formed when into the 'Provisional' and 'Official' factions. While the older IRA had embraced non-violent civil agitation, the new Provisional IRA was determined to wage \"armed struggle\" against British rule in Northern Ireland. The new IRA was willing to take on the role of \"defenders of the Catholic community\", rather than seeking working-class ecumenical unity across both communities.\n\nNationalists point to a number of events in these years to explain the upsurge in violence. One such incident was the Falls Curfew in July 1970, when 3,000 troops imposed a curfew on the nationalist Lower Falls area of Belfast, firing more than 1,500 rounds of ammunition in gun battles with the Official IRA and killing four people. Another was the introduction of internment without trial in 1971 (of 350 initial detainees, none were Protestants). Moreover, due to poor intelligence, very few of those interned were actually republican activists at the time, but some internees became increasingly radicalised as a result of their experiences.\n\nA third event \"Bloody Sunday\", was the shooting dead of thirteen unarmed male civilians by the British Army at a proscribed anti-internment rally in Derry on 30 January 1972 (a fourteenth man died of his injuries some months later) while more than fourteen other civilians were wounded. The march had been organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). The soldiers involved were members of the 1st Battalion, Parachute Regiment, also known as \"1 Para\".\n\nThis was one of the most prominent events that occurred during the Northern Irish Conflict as it was recorded as the largest number of civilians killed in a single shooting incident during the Troubles, though more were killed overall in the 1998 Omagh bombing incident.\n\nBloody Sunday greatly increased the hostility of Catholics and Irish nationalists towards the British military and government while significantly elevating tensions during the Northern Irish Conflict. As a result, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) gained more support, especially through rising numbers of recruits in the local areas.\n\nFollowing the introduction of internment there were numerous gun battles between the British army and both the Provisional and Official IRA. Between 1971 and 1975, 1,981 people were interned; 1,874 were Catholic/republican, while 107 were Protestant/loyalist. There were widespread allegations of abuse and even torture of detainees, and in 1972, the \"five techniques\" used by the police and army for interrogation were ruled to be illegal following a British government inquiry.\n\nThe Provisional IRA, or \"Provos\", as they became known, sought to establish itself as the defender of the nationalist community. The Official IRA (OIRA) began its own armed campaign in reaction to the ongoing violence. The Provisional IRA's offensive campaign began in early 1971 when the Army Council sanctioned attacks on the British Army.\n\nIn 1972, the Provisional IRA killed approximately 100 members of the security forces, wounded 500 others, and carried out approximately 1,300 bombings, mostly against commercial targets which they considered \"the artificial economy\". The bombing campaign killed many civilians, notably on Bloody Friday on 21 July, when 22 bombs were set off in the centre of Belfast, killing seven civilians and two soldiers.\n\nIn the same year, the Official IRA killed dozens of soldiers and wounded several more, mostly through gun attacks, according to the CAIN project's Sutton database. The Official IRA called off its campaign in May 1972.\n\nBritish troop concentrations peaked at 20:1000 of the civilian population, the highest ratio found in the history of counterinsurgency warfare, higher than that achieved during the \"Malayan Emergency\"/\"Anti-British National Liberation War\", which the conflict is frequently compared to. Operation Motorman, the military operation for the surge, was the biggest military operation in Ireland since the Irish War of Independence. In total, almost 22,000 British forces were involved, In the days before 31 July, about 4,000 extra troops were brought into Northern Ireland.\n\nDespite a temporary ceasefire in 1972 and talks with British officials, the Provisionals were determined to continue their campaign until the achievement of a united Ireland. The UK government in London, believing the Northern Ireland administration incapable of containing the security situation, sought to take over the control of law and order there. As this was unacceptable to the Northern Ireland Government, the British government pushed through emergency legislation (the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972) which suspended the unionist-controlled Stormont parliament and government, and introduced \"direct rule\" from London. Direct rule was initially intended as a short-term measure; the medium-term strategy was to restore self-government to Northern Ireland on a basis that was acceptable to both unionists and nationalists. Agreement proved elusive, however, and the Troubles continued throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and the 1990s within a context of political deadlock. The existence of \"no-go areas\" in Belfast and Derry was a challenge to the authority of the British government in Northern Ireland, and the British Army demolished the barricades and re-established control over the areas in Operation Motorman on 31 July 1972.\n\nIn June 1973, following the publication of a British White Paper and a referendum in March on the status of Northern Ireland, a new parliamentary body, the Northern Ireland Assembly, was established. Elections to this were held on 28 June. In October 1973, mainstream nationalist and unionist parties, along with the British and Irish governments, negotiated the Sunningdale Agreement, which was intended to produce a political settlement within Northern Ireland, but with a so-called \"Irish dimension\" involving the Republic. The agreement provided for \"power-sharing\" – the creation of an executive containing both unionists and nationalists—and a \"Council of Ireland\" – a body made up of ministers from Northern Ireland and the Republic, designed to encourage cross-border co-operation. The similarities between the Sunningdale Agreement and the Belfast Agreement of 1998 has led some commentators to characterise the latter as \"Sunningdale for slow learners\". This assertion has been criticised by political scientists one of whom stated that \"..there are... significant differences between them [Sunningdale and Belfast], both in terms of content and the circumstances surrounding their negotiation, implementation, and operation\".\nUnionists were split over Sunningdale, which was also opposed by the IRA, whose goal remained nothing short of an end to the existence of Northern Ireland as part of the UK. Many unionists opposed the concept of power-sharing, arguing that it was not feasible to share power with those (nationalists) who sought the destruction of the state. Perhaps more significant, however, was the unionist opposition to the \"Irish dimension\" and the Council of Ireland, which was perceived as being an all-Ireland parliament-in-waiting. Remarks by a young SDLP councillor, Hugh Logue, to an audience at Trinity College Dublin that Sunningdale was the tool \"by which the Unionists will be trundled off to a united Ireland\" also damaged chances of significant unionist support for the agreement. In January 1974, Brian Faulkner was narrowly deposed as UUP leader and replaced by Harry West. A UK general election in February 1974 gave the anti-Sunningdale unionists the opportunity to test unionist opinion with the slogan \"Dublin is only a Sunningdale away\", and the result galvanised their opposition: they won 11 of the 12 seats, winning 58% of the vote with most of the rest going to nationalists and pro-Sunningdale unionists.\n\nUltimately, however, the Sunningdale Agreement was brought down by mass action on the part of loyalist paramilitaries (primarily the Ulster Defence Association, at that time over 20,000 strong and workers, who formed the Ulster Workers' Council. They organised a general strike: the Ulster Workers' Council strike. This severely curtailed business in Northern Ireland and cut off essential services such as water and electricity. Nationalists argue that the British Government did not do enough to break this strike and uphold the Sunningdale initiative. There is evidence that the strike was further encouraged by MI5, a part of their campaign to 'disorientate' British prime minister Harold Wilson's government. Faced with such opposition, the pro-Sunningdale unionists resigned from the power-sharing government and the new regime collapsed. Three days into the UWC strike, on 17 May 1974, two UVF teams from the Belfast and Mid-Ulster brigades detonated three no-warning car bombs in Dublin's city centre during the Friday evening rush hour, resulting in 26 deaths and close to 300 injuries. Ninety minutes later, a fourth car bomb exploded in Monaghan, killing seven additional people. Nobody has ever been convicted for these attacks.\n\nWilson had secretly met with the IRA in 1971 while leader of the opposition; his government in late 1974 and early 1975 again met with the IRA to negotiate a ceasefire. During the meetings the parties discussed the possibility of British withdrawal from an independent Northern Ireland. The failure of Sunningdale led to the serious consideration in London until November 1975 of independence. Had the withdrawal occurred —which Wilson supported but others, including James Callaghan, opposed – the region would have become a separate Dominion of the British Commonwealth.\n\nThe British negotiations with an illegal organisation angered the Irish government. It did not know their proceedings but feared that the British were considering abandoning Northern Ireland. Foreign Minister Garret FitzGerald discussed in a memorandum of June 1975 the possibilities of orderly withdrawal and independence, repartition of the island or a collapse of Northern Ireland into civil war and anarchy. The memorandum preferred a negotiated independence as the best of the three \"worst case scenarios\", but concluded that the Irish government could do little.\n\nThe Irish government had already failed to prevent the IRA from burning down the British Embassy in 1972. It believed that it could not enlarge the country's small army of 12,500 men without negative consequences. A civil war in Northern Ireland would cause many deaths there and severe consequences for the Republic, as the public would demand that it intervene to protect nationalists. FitzGerald warned Callaghan that the failure to intervene, despite Ireland's inability to do so, would \"threaten democratic government in the Republic\", which in turn jeopardised British and European security against Communist and other foreign nations.\n\nThe Irish government so dreaded the consequences of an independent Northern Ireland that FitzGerald refused to ask the British not to withdraw—as he feared that openly discussing the issue could permit the British to proceed—and other members of government opposed the Irish Cabinet even discussing what FitzGerald referred to as a \"doomsday scenario\". He wrote in 2006 that \"Neither then nor since has public opinion in Ireland realised how close to disaster our whole island came during the last two years of Harold Wilson's premiership.\"\n\nMerlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, had lifted the proscription against the UVF in April 1974. In December, one month after the Birmingham pub bombings which killed 21 people, the IRA declared a ceasefire; this would theoretically last throughout most of the following year. The ceasefire notwithstanding, sectarian killings actually escalated in 1975, along with internal feuding between rival paramilitary groups. This made 1975 one of the \"bloodiest years of the conflict\".\n\nOn 31 July 1975 at Buskhill, outside Newry, the popular Irish cabaret band \"The Miami Showband\" was returning home to Dublin after a gig in Banbridge when it was ambushed by gunmen from the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade wearing British Army uniforms at a bogus military roadside checkpoint on the main A1 road. Three of the bandmembers, two Catholics and a Protestant, were shot dead, while two of the UVF men were killed when the bomb they had loaded onto the band's minibus detonated prematurely. The following January, eleven Protestant workers were gunned down in Kingsmill, South Armagh after having been ordered off their bus by an armed republican gang, which called itself the South Armagh Republican Action Force. One man survived despite being shot 18 times, leaving ten fatalities. These killings were reportedly in retaliation to a loyalist double shooting attack against the Reavey and O'Dowd families the previous night.\n\nThe violence continued through the rest of the 1970s. The British Government reinstated the ban against the UVF in October 1975, making it once more an illegal organisation. When the Provisional IRA's December 1974 ceasefire had ended in early 1976 and it had returned to violence, it had lost the hope that it had felt in the early 1970s that it could force a rapid British withdrawal from Northern Ireland, and instead developed a strategy known as the \"Long War\", which involved a less intense but more sustained campaign of violence that could continue indefinitely. The Official IRA ceasefire of 1972, however, became permanent, and the \"Official\" movement eventually evolved into the Workers' Party, which rejected violence completely. However, a splinter from the \"Officials\"—the Irish National Liberation Army—continued a campaign of violence in 1974.\n\nBy the late 1970s, war-weariness was visible in both communities. One manifestation of this was the formation of a group known as \"Peace People\", which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1976. The Peace People organised large demonstrations calling for an end to paramilitary violence. Their campaign lost momentum, however, after they appealed to the nationalist community to provide information on the IRA to security forces.\n\nThe decade ended with a double attack by the IRA against the British. On 27 August 1979, Lord Mountbatten while on holiday in Mullaghmore, County Sligo, was killed by a bomb planted on board his boat. Three other people were also killed: Lady Brabourne, the elderly mother of Mountbatten's son-in-law; and two teenagers, a grandson of Mountbatten and a local boatman. That same day, eighteen British soldiers, mostly members of the Parachute Regiment, were killed by two remote-controlled bombs in the Warrenpoint ambush at Warrenpoint, County Down.\nSuccessive British Governments, having failed to achieve a political settlement, tried to \"normalise\" Northern Ireland. Aspects included the removal of internment without trial and the removal of political status for paramilitary prisoners. From 1972 onward, paramilitaries were tried in juryless Diplock courts to avoid intimidation of jurors. On conviction, they were to be treated as ordinary criminals. Resistance to this policy among republican prisoners led to more than 500 of them in the Maze prison initiating the \"blanket\" and \"dirty\" protests. Their protests culminated in hunger strikes in 1980 and 1981, aimed at the restoration of political status, as well as other concessions.\n\nIn the 1981 Irish hunger strike, ten republican prisoners (seven from the Provisional IRA and three from the INLA) died of starvation. The first hunger striker to die, Bobby Sands, was elected to Parliament on an Anti-H-Block ticket, as was his election agent Owen Carron following Sands' death. The hunger strikes resonated among many nationalists; over 100,000 people attended Sands' funeral mass in West Belfast and thousands attended those of the other hunger strikers. From an Irish republican perspective, the significance of these events was to demonstrate potential for a political and electoral strategy.\n\nIn the wake of the hunger strikes, Sinn Féin, which had become the Provisional IRA's political wing, began to contest elections for the first time in both Northern Ireland (as abstentionists) and in the Republic. In 1986, Sinn Féin recognised the legitimacy of the Irish Dáil, which caused a small group of members to break away and form Republican Sinn Féin.\n\nThe IRA's \"Long War\" was boosted by large donations of arms from Libya in the 1980s (see Provisional IRA arms importation) due to Muammar Gaddafi's anger at Thatcher's government for assisting the Reagan government's bombing of Tripoli, which had killed one of Gaddafi's children, as well as by monies from pro-IRA partisans in the United States and elsewhere throughout the Irish diaspora. \n\nThe INLA was highly active in the early and mid-1980s. In 1982, it bombed a disco frequented by off-duty British soldiers, killing 11 soldiers and six civilians. One of the IRA's most high-profile actions in this period was the Brighton hotel bombing on 12 October 1984, when it set off a 100-pound bomb in the Grand Brighton Hotel in Brighton, where politicians including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher were staying for the Conservative Party conference. The bomb, which exploded in the early hours of the morning, killed five people, including Conservative MP Sir Anthony Berry and the wife of Government Chief Whip John Wakeham, and thirty-four others were injured, including Wakeham, Trade and Industry Secretary Norman Tebbit, and Tebbit's wife, Margaret. Margaret Tebbit was left permanently paralysed, while her husband's injuries were less serious.\n\nOn 28 February 1985 in Newry, nine RUC officers, seven Protestants and two Catholics, were killed after a mortar attack on the police station in Corry Square. The attack was planned by the IRA South Armagh Brigade and an IRA unit in Newry. Nine shells were fired from a Mark 10 mortar which was bolted onto the back of a hijacked Ford van in Crossmaglen. Eight shells overshot the station, but the ninth hit a Portakabin which was being used as a canteen. On 8 November 1987, in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, a Provisional IRA time bomb exploded during a parade on Remembrance Day to commemorate victims of World War One. The bomb went off by a cenotaph which was at the heart of the parade. Eleven people (ten civilians, including a pregnant woman, and one serving member of the RUC) were killed and 63 were injured. Former school headmaster Ronnie Hill was seriously injured in the bombing and slipped into a coma two days later, remaining in this condition for more than a decade before his death in December 2000. The IRA eventually apologised for what it claimed had been a mistake and that its target had been the British soldiers parading to the memorial. The unit which carried out the bombing was disbanded. Loyalist paramilitaries responded to the bombing with revenge attacks on Catholics, mostly civilians. Another bomb had been planted at nearby Tullyhommon at a parallel Remembrance Day commemoration but failed to detonate.\n\nFour months after the Enniskillen attacks, three IRA volunteers were shot dead at a Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue in Gibraltar, the British colony attached to the south of Spain. This became known as Operation Flavius. Their funeral at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast was attacked by Michael Stone, a UDA member who threw grenades and fired shots as the coffin was lowered. The attack killed three people, including an IRA volunteer. Stone was jailed for life the following year but freed 11 years later under the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nWhen two British soldiers, David Howes and Derek Wood, drove into the joint funeral in Andersonstown being held for the three men killed by Stone, they were found to be armed, and were captured, taken away and shot dead. This became known as the Corporals killings.\n\nIn the 1980s, loyalist paramilitary groups, including the Ulster Volunteer Force, the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Resistance, imported arms and explosives from South Africa. The weapons obtained were divided between the UDA, the UVF and Ulster Resistance, although some of the weaponry (such as rocket-propelled grenades) were hardly used. These killings were reportedly in response to the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement which gave the Irish government a \"consultative role\" in the government of Northern Ireland. In 1987, the Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO), a breakaway faction of the INLA, engaged in a bloody feud against the INLA which weakened the INLA's presence in some areas. By 1992, the IPLO was destroyed by the Provisionals for its involvement in drug dealing thus ending the feud.\n\nAround this time republicans alleged that a \"shoot-to-kill policy\" was in operation in Northern Ireland, in which tens of republican paramilitaries and one loyalist paramilitary were killed on active duty, usually by the SAS or RUC.\n\nSince the late 1980s, while the IRA continued its armed campaign, its political wing Sinn Féin, led since 1983 by Gerry Adams, sought a negotiated end to the conflict, although Adams accurately predicted that this would be a very long process. He predicted the war would last another 20 years. He conducted open talks with John Hume – the SDLP leader – and secret talks with government officials. Loyalists were also engaged in behind-the-scenes talks to end the violence, connecting with the British and Irish governments through Protestant clergy, in particular the Presbyterian minister, Reverend Roy Magee and Anglican Archbishop Robin Eames.\n\nWhen a French TV crew filmed the IRA at a training camp in Donegal, a representative of the General Headquarters Staff of the IRA was interviewed. He said the IRA would \"[E]ventually sap the political will of the British government to remain in Ireland\". \n\nThe IRA's South Armagh Brigade had made the countryside village of Crossmaglen their stronghold since the 1970s. The surrounding villages of Silverbridge, Cullyhanna, Cullaville, Forkhill, Jonesborough and Creggan were also IRA strongholds. In February 1978, a British Army Gazelle helicopter was shot down near Silverbridge, killing Lieutenant Colonel Ian Corden-Lloyd of the British Army.\n\nIn the 1990s, the IRA came up with a new plan to restrict British Army foot patrols near Crossmaglen. They developed two sniper teams to attack British Army and RUC patrols. They usually fired from an improvised armoured car using a .50 BMG calibre M82 sniper rifle. Signs were put up around South Armagh reading \"Sniper at Work\". The snipers killed a total of nine members of the security forces: seven soldiers and two constables. The last to be killed before the Good Friday Agreement (GFA), was a British soldier, bombardier Steven Restorick.\n\nThe IRA had developed the capacity to attack helicopters in South Armagh and elsewhere since the 1980s, including the 1990 shootdown of a Gazelle flying over the border between Tyrone and Monaghan; there were no fatalities in that incident.\n\nAnother incident involving British helicopters in South Armagh was the Battle of Newry Road in September 1993. Two other helicopters, a British Army Lynx and a Royal Air Force Puma were shot down by improvised mortar fire in 1994. The IRA set up checkpoints in South Armagh during this period, unchallenged by the security forces.\nAfter a prolonged period of background political manoeuvring, both loyalist and republican paramilitary groups declared ceasefires in 1994.\n\nThe year leading up to the ceasefires was a particularly tense one, marked by atrocities. The UDA and UVF stepped up their attacks. The IRA responded with the Shankill Road bombing in October 1993, which aimed to kill the UDA leadership, but killed eight Protestant civilian shoppers and one low-ranking UDA member, as well as one of the perpetrators, who was killed when the bomb detonated prematurely. The UDA retaliated with mass shootings in nationalist areas such as Greysteel and Castlerock. Twelve people were killed at Greysteel and Castlerock, all but two of whom were Catholic.\n\nOn 16 June 1994, just before the ceasefires, the Irish National Liberation Army killed a UVF member in a gun attack on the Shankill Road. In revenge, three days later, the UVF killed six civilians in a shooting at a pub in Loughinisland, County Down. The IRA, in the remaining month before its ceasefire, killed four senior loyalist paramilitaries, three from the UDA and one from the UVF. On 31 August 1994, the IRA declared a ceasefire. The loyalist paramilitaries, temporarily united in the \"Combined Loyalist Military Command\", reciprocated six weeks later. Although these ceasefires failed in the short run, they marked an effective end to large-scale political violence, as they paved the way for the final ceasefires.\n\nIn 1995, the United States appointed George J. Mitchell as the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland. Mitchell was recognised as being more than a token envoy and someone representing a President (Bill Clinton) with a deep interest in events. The British and Irish governments agreed that Mitchell would chair an international commission on disarmament of paramilitary groups.\n\nOn 9 February 1996, less than two years after the declaration of the ceasefire, the IRA revoked it with the Docklands bombing in the Canary Wharf area of London, killing two people, injuring 39 others, and causing £85 million in damage to the city's financial centre. Sinn Féin blamed the failure of the ceasefire on the British Government's refusal to begin all-party negotiations until the IRA decommissioned its weapons.\n\nThe attack was followed by several more, most notably the 1996 Manchester bombing, which destroyed a large area of the centre of the city on 15 June. It was the largest bomb attack in Britain since World War II. While the attack avoided any fatalities due to a telephone warning and the rapid response of the emergency services to it, over 200 people were injured in the attack, many of them outside the established cordon. The damage caused by the blast was estimated at £411 million. Lance Bombardier Stephen Restorick, the last British soldier killed before the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) was finalised, was shot dead at a border crossing on 12 February 1997 by the \"South Armagh sniper\", later identified as Bernard Henry McGinn.\n\nThe IRA reinstated their ceasefire in July 1997, as negotiations for the document that became known as the Good Friday Agreement began without Sinn Féin. In September of the same year Sinn Féin signed the Mitchell Principles and were admitted to the talks. The UVF was the first paramilitary grouping to split as a result of their ceasefire, spawning the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in 1996. In December 1997, the INLA assassinated LVF leader Billy Wright, leading to a series of revenge killings by loyalist groups. A group split from the Provisional IRA and formed the Real IRA (RIRA).\n\nIn August 1998, a Real IRA bomb in Omagh killed 29 civilians. This bombing discredited \"dissident republicans\" and their campaigns in the eyes of many who had previously supported the Provisionals' campaign. They became small groups with little influence, but still capable of violence.\n\nThe INLA also declared a ceasefire after the Belfast Agreement of 1998. Since then, most paramilitary violence has been directed at their \"own\" communities and at other factions within their organisations. The UDA, for example, has feuded with their fellow loyalists the UVF on two occasions since 2000. There have been internal struggles for power between \"brigade commanders\" and involvement in organised crime.\n\nProvisional IRA members have since been accused or convicted of involvement in the killings of Robert McCartney, Matthew Burns, James Curran, and Andrew Kearney, among others.\n\nAfter the ceasefires, talks began between the main political parties in Northern Ireland to establish political agreement. These talks led to the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. This Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of \"power-sharing\". In 1999, an executive was formed consisting of the four main parties, including Sinn Féin. Other important changes included the reform of the RUC, renamed as the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which was required to recruit at least a 50% quota of Catholics for ten years, and the abolition of Diplock courts under the Justice and Security (Northern Ireland) Act 2007.\n\nA security normalisation process also began as part of the treaty, which comprised the progressive closing of redundant British Army barracks, border observation towers, and the withdrawal of all forces taking part in Operation Banner – including the resident battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment – that would be replaced by an infantry brigade, deployed in ten sites around Northern Ireland but with no operative role in the province.\n\nThe power-sharing Executive and Assembly were suspended in 2002, when unionists withdrew following \"Stormontgate\", a controversy over allegations of an IRA spy ring operating at Stormont. There were ongoing tensions about the Provisional IRA's failure to disarm fully and sufficiently quickly. IRA decommissioning has since been completed (in September 2005) to the satisfaction of most parties.\n\nA feature of Northern Ireland politics since the Agreement has been the eclipse in electoral terms of parties such as the Social Democratic and Labour Party and Ulster Unionist Party, by rival parties such as Sinn Féin and the DUP. Similarly, although political violence is greatly reduced, sectarian animosity has not disappeared. Residential areas are more segregated between Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists than ever. Thus, progress towards restoring the power-sharing institutions was slow and tortuous. On 8 May 2007, devolved government returned to Northern Ireland. DUP leader Ian Paisley and Sinn Féin's Martin McGuinness took office as First Minister and deputy First Minister, respectively.\n\nIn their efforts to defeat the IRA, there were many incidents of collusion between the British state security forces (the British Army and RUC) and loyalist paramilitaries. This included soldiers and policemen taking part in loyalist attacks while off-duty, giving weapons and intelligence to loyalists, not taking action against them, and hindering police investigations. The \"De Silva Report\" found that, during the 1980s, 85% of the intelligence loyalists used to target people came from the security forces. The security forces also had double agents and informers within loyalist groups who organised attacks on the orders of, or with the knowledge of, their handlers. Of the 210 loyalists arrested by the Stevens Inquiries team, 207 were found to be state agents or informers.\n\nThe British Army's locally recruited Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was almost wholly Protestant.\n\nDespite the vetting process, some loyalist militants managed to enlist; mainly to obtain weapons, training and information. By 1990, at least 197 UDR soldiers had been convicted of loyalist terrorist offences and other serious crimes, including 19 convicted of murder. This was only a small fraction of those who served in it, but the proportion was higher than the regular British Army, the RUC and the civilian population.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the Glenanne gang—a secret alliance of loyalist militants, British soldiers and RUC officers—carried out a string of gun and bomb attacks against nationalists in an area of Northern Ireland known as the \"murder triangle\". It also carried out some attacks in the Republic, killing about 120 people in total, mostly uninvolved civilians. The \"Cassel Report\" investigated 76 murders attributed to the group and found evidence that soldiers and policemen were involved in 74 of those. One member, RUC officer John Weir, claimed his superiors knew of the collusion but allowed it to continue. The \"Cassel Report\" also said some senior officers knew of the crimes but did nothing to prevent, investigate or punish. Attacks attributed to the group include the Dublin and Monaghan bombings (1974), the Miami Showband killings (1975) and the Reavey and O'Dowd killings (1976).\n\nThe Stevens Inquiries found that elements of the security forces had used loyalists as \"proxies\", who, via, double-agents and informers, had helped loyalist groups to kill targeted individuals, usually suspected republicans but civilians were also killed, intentionally and otherwise. The inquiries concluded this had intensified and prolonged the conflict. The British Army's Force Research Unit (FRU) was the main agency involved. Brian Nelson, the UDA's chief 'intelligence officer', was a FRU agent. Through Nelson, FRU helped loyalists target people for assassination. FRU commanders say they helped loyalists target only republican activists and prevented the killing of civilians.\n\nThe Inquiries found evidence only two lives were saved and that Nelson/FRU was responsible for at least 30 murders and many other attacks – many on civilians. One victim was solicitor Pat Finucane. Nelson also supervised the shipping of weapons to loyalists in 1988. From 1992 to 1994, loyalists were responsible for more deaths than republicans, partly due to FRU. Members of the security forces tried to obstruct the Stevens investigation.\n\nA 2007 Police Ombudsman report revealed that UVF members had been allowed to commit a string of terrorist offences, including murder, while working as informers for RUC Special Branch. It found that Special Branch had given informers immunity by ensuring they weren't caught or convicted, and blocking weapons searches. Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan concluded that this had led to \"hundreds\" of deaths and said senior British Government officials pressured her into halting her investigation. UVF member Robin Jackson has been linked to between 50 and 100 killings in Northern Ireland, although he was never convicted for any. It is alleged by many, including members of the security forces, that Jackson was an RUC agent. The Irish Government's \"Barron Report\" alleged that he also \"had relationships with British Intelligence\".\n\nThe Smithwick Tribunal also concluded that a member of the Garda Síochána (the Republic of Ireland's police force) colluded with the IRA in the killing of two senior RUC officers in 1989.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, republican and loyalist paramilitaries abducted a number of individuals, many alleged to have been informers, to be interrogated under torture and then executed. Eighteen people—two women and sixteen men—including one British Army officer, were kidnapped and killed during the Troubles. They are referred to informally as \"The Disappeared\". All but one, Lisa Dorrian, were abducted and killed by republicans. Dorrian is believed to have been abducted by loyalists. The remains of all but four of \"The Disappeared\" have been recovered and turned over to their families.\n\nBritish government security forces, including the Military Reaction Force (MRF), carried out what have been described as \"extrajudicial killings\" of unarmed civilians. Their victims were often Catholic or suspected Catholic civilians unaffiliated with any paramilitaries, such as 12 May 1972 Andersonstown shooting of seven unarmed Catholic civilians and 15 April 1972 Whiterock Road shooting of two unarmed Catholic civilians by British soldiers. A member of the MRF stated in 1978 that the Army often attempted false flag sectarian attacks, thus provoking sectarian conflict and \"taking the heat off the Army\". A former member stated that \"[W]e were not there to act like an army unit, we were there to act like a terror group\".\n\nRepublicans allege that the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy rather than arresting IRA suspects. The security forces denied this and point out that in incidents such as the killing of eight IRA men at Loughgall in 1987, the IRA members who were killed were heavily armed. Others argue that incidents such as the shooting of three unarmed IRA members in Gibraltar by the Special Air Service ten months later confirmed suspicions among republicans, and in the British and Irish media, of a tacit British shoot-to-kill policy of suspected IRA members.\n\nInter-communal tensions rise and violence often breaks out during the \"marching season\" when the Protestant Orange Order parades take place across Northern Ireland. The parades are held to commemorate William of Orange's victory in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, which secured the Protestant Ascendancy and British rule in Ireland. One particular flashpoint which has caused continuous annual strife is the Garvaghy Road area in Portadown, where an Orange parade from Drumcree Church passes through a mainly nationalist estate off the Garvaghy Road. This parade has now been banned indefinitely, following nationalist riots against the parade, and also loyalist counter-riots against its banning.\n\nIn 1995, 1996 and 1997, there were several weeks of prolonged rioting throughout Northern Ireland over the impasse at Drumcree. A number of people died in this violence, including a Catholic taxi driver, killed by the Loyalist Volunteer Force, and three (of four) nominally Catholic brothers (from a mixed-religion family) died when their house in Ballymoney was petrol-bombed.\n\nThe impact of the Troubles on the ordinary people of Northern Ireland has been compared to that of the Blitz on the people of London. The stress resulting from bomb attacks, street disturbances, security checkpoints, and the constant military presence had the strongest effect on children and young adults. There was also the fear that local paramilitaries instilled in their respective communities with the punishment beatings, \"romperings\", and the occasional tarring and feathering meted out to individuals for various purported infractions.\n\nIn addition to the violence and intimidation, there was chronic unemployment and a severe housing shortage. Many people were rendered homeless as a result of intimidation or having their houses burnt, and urban redevelopment played a role in the social upheaval. Belfast families faced being transferred to new, alien estates when older, decrepit districts such as Sailortown and the Pound Loney were being demolished. According to social worker and author Sarah Nelson, this new social problem of homelessness and disorientation contributed to the breakdown of the normal fabric of society, allowing for paramilitaries to exert a strong influence in certain districts. Vandalism was also a major problem. In the 1970s there were 10,000 vandalised empty houses in Belfast alone. Most of the vandals were aged between eight and thirteen.\n\nAccording to one historian of the conflict, the stress of the Troubles engendered a breakdown in the previously strict sexual morality of Northern Ireland, resulting in a \"confused hedonism\" in respect of personal life. In Derry, illegitimate births and alcoholism increased for women and the divorce rate rose. Teenage alcoholism was also a problem, partly as a result of the drinking clubs established in both loyalist and republican areas. In many cases, there was little parental supervision of children in some of the poorer districts. The Department of Health has looked at a report written in 2007 by Mike Tomlinson of Queen's University, which asserted that the legacy of the Troubles has played a substantial role in the current rate of suicide in Northern Ireland.\n\nAccording to the Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN), 3,532 people were killed as a result of the conflict, from 1969 to 2001. Of these, 3,489 were killed from 1969 to 1998. According to the book \"Lost Lives\" (2006 edition), 3,720 people were killed as a result of the conflict, from 1966 to 2006. Of these, 3,635 were killed from 1969 to 1998. There are reports that 257 of the victims were children under the age of seventeen, representing 7.2% of all the total during this period. Other reports state that a total of 274 children under the age of eighteen were killed during the conflict.\n\nIn \"The Politics of Antagonism: Understanding Northern Ireland\", Brendan O'Leary and John McGarry point out that \"nearly two per cent of the population of Northern Ireland have been killed or injured through political violence [...] If the equivalent ratio of victims to population had been produced in Great Britain in the same period some 100,000 people would have died, and if a similar level of political violence had taken place, the number of fatalities in the USA would have been over 500,000\". Using this relative comparison to the US, analyst John M. Gates suggests that whatever one calls the conflict, it was \"certainly not\" a \"low intensity conflict\".\n\nIn 2010 it was estimated that 107,000 people in Northern Ireland suffered some physical injury as a result of the conflict. On the basis of data gathered by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency, the Victims Commission estimated that the conflict resulted in 500,000 'victims' in Northern Ireland alone. It defines 'victims' are those who are directly affected by 'bereavement', 'physical injury' or 'trauma' as a result of the conflict.\n\nApproximately 60% of the dead were killed by republicans, 30% by loyalists and 10% by British security forces.\n\nAccording to Malcolm Sutton's \"Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland\":\n\nOf those killed by British security forces:\n\nOf those killed by republican paramilitaries:\n\nOf those killed by loyalist paramilitaries:\n\nApproximately 52% of the dead were civilians, 32% were members/former members of the British security forces, 11% were members of republican paramilitaries, and 5% were members of loyalist paramilitaries. About 60% of the civilian casualties were Catholics, 30% were Protestants, and the rest were from outside Northern Ireland.\n\nOf the civilian casualties, 48% were killed by loyalists, 39% were killed by republicans, and 10% were killed by the British security forces.\n\nIt has been the subject of dispute whether some individuals were members of paramilitary organisations due to their secretive nature. Several casualties that were listed as civilians were later claimed by the IRA as their members. One Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and three Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) members killed during the conflict were also Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers at the time of their deaths. At least one civilian victim was an off-duty member of the Territorial Army.\n\nMost killings took place within Northern Ireland, especially in Belfast. Most of the killings in Belfast took place in the west and north of the city. Dublin, London and Birmingham were also affected, albeit to a lesser degree than Northern Ireland itself. Occasionally, the IRA attempted or carried out attacks on British targets in Gibraltar, Germany and the Netherlands.\n\n\n\n\n"}

TO is an international theatre festival, which is presenting some of the achievements of the greatest theatre practitioners from around the world. It is a platform for theatrical exchange, a gathering place for students and masters, where a dialogue despite ideological, culture and language differences is encouraged. Moreover, as its subtitle suggests, Crossing Millennia, it is an initiative that emphasizes the importance of connecting the past, present, and future together. For this reason, the festival is promoting richness and diversity of theatre heritage and also all kinds of experiments and research in the field of performing arts. The goal of the TO is to strengthen and re-establish the statues of contemporary theatre in the world. This objective is achieved by contributing to the growth of international collaboration, building a network among artists all over the world and, creating an opportunity for the host of the festival to showcase and promote their work in theatre and other performing arts.\n\nThe first official meeting of the International Committee of TO took place on the 18th of June, 1994 in Delphi, Greece. The founding committee was a group of eight internationally renowned theatre directors: Theodoros Terzopoulos, Nuria Espert, Antunes Filho, Tony Harrison, Yuri Lyubimov, Heiner Müller, Tadashi Suzuki and Robert Wilson. According to their decisions the TO is a non-profit organization. Its administrative headquarters are located in Athens, Greece (European office) and in Togamura, Japan (Asian office). Moreover, the International Committee of TO meets once a year. It can attract new members, on the condition of gaining at least two-thirds of the votes and being recommended by one of the existing members. The TO has its one logotype, which was designed by the American theater stage director, Robert Wilson.\n\nCurrently the International Committee of TO consists of fourteen members: \n\nThe TO each time is held in a different country. So far there have been five festivals and, except from one, took place in the countries of the members of the International Committee of TO. An International Committee member, who represents the host country, has the honor to be responsible for its artistic directing. In addition, he also has to establish the national organizing committee, consisting of prominent representatives of the country’s cultural life.\n\nThe hosting cities have been:\n\nSources\n"}

The theatre was used by the troupe of Molière from 1660 to 1673 and as an opera house by the Académie Royale de Musique from 1673 to 1763, when it was destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt and reopened in 1770, but again was destroyed by fire in 1781 and not rebuilt.\n\nThe Palais-Royal was originally known as the Palais-Cardinal, since it was built in the 1630s as the principal residence of Cardinal Richelieu. In 1637 Richelieu asked his architect Jacques Le Mercier to begin work on the theatre, which opened in 1641 and was initially known as the Great Hall of the Palais-Cardinal. Upon Richelieu's death in 1642, he left the property to King Louis XIII, and it became known as the Palais-Royal, although the name Palais-Cardinal sometimes still continued to be used.\n\nThe troupe of Molière and the troop of the Italians put on the shows here between 1660 and 1673. Molière's most notable plays were performed here, including \"L'École des femmes\" (first performed 26 December 1662), \"Tartuffe\" (12 May 1664), \"Dom Juan\" (15 February 1665), \"Le Misanthrope\" (4 June 1666), \"L'Avare\" (9 September 1668), \"Le Bourgeois gentilhomme\" (23 November 1670), and \"Le malade imaginaire\" (10 February 1673).\n\nOn the death of his old collaborator, Lully ejected Molière's troupe to a new home at the Hôtel de Guénégaud and re-used the theatre as the opera house of the Académie royale de Musique (the name of the Paris Opera at the time). Lully had much building work done on it in order to allow the installation of new stage machinery designed by Carlo Vigarani, capable of supporting the imposing sets of the operas he would later put on here. This replaced the old machinery designed by Giacomo Torelli in 1645. After Vigarani's modifications the theatre had a total capacity of about 1,270 spectators: a parterre for 600 standing, amphitheatre seating for 120, and boxes with balconies accommodating another 550. The stage was 9.4 meters across and 17 meters deep, with space in front for the orchestra 7.6 meters across and 3 meters deep.\n\nSeveral of Lully's operas (\"tragédies en musique\") were premiered at the Palais-Royal, including \"Alceste\" (19 January 1674), \"Amadis\" (18 January 1684), and \"Armide\" (15 February 1686). In the 18th century many of Rameau's works were first performed here, including \"Hippolyte et Aricie\" (1 October 1733), \"Les Indes galantes\" (23 August 1735), \"Castor et Pollux\" (24 October 1737), \"Dardanus\" (19 November 1739), and \"Zoroastre\" (5 December 1749).\n\nThe Opera's first theatre was destroyed by fire on 6 April 1763.\n\nThe City of Paris, which was responsible for the opera house, decided to build a new theatre on a site slightly further to the east (where the rue de Valois is located today). In the meantime the company performed in the Salle des Machines in the Tuileries Palace, which was first reduced to a size more suitable for opera by the architect Jacques-Germain Soufflot. The new theatre in the Palais-Royal was designed by architect Pierre-Louis Moreau Desproux and was the first purpose-built opera house in Paris. It had a capacity of more than 2,000 spectators.\n\nThe new theatre opened on 20 January 1770 with a performance of Rameau's \"Zoroastre\". It is especially noteworthy as the theatre where most of the French operas of Christoph Willibald Gluck were first performed, including \"Iphigénie en Aulide\" (19 April 1774), \"Orphée et Eurydice\" (the French version of \"Orfeo ed Euridice\") (2 August 1774), the revised version of \"Alceste\" (23 April 1776), \"Armide\" (23 September 1777), \"Iphigénie en Tauride\" (18 May 1779), and \"Echo et Narcisse\" (24 September 1779). Among the many other works premiered here are Piccinni's \"Atys\" (22 February 1780), Grétry's \"Andromaque\" (6 June 1780), Philidor's \"Persée\" (27 October 1780), and Piccinni's \"Iphigénie en Tauride\" (23 January 1781).\n\nThe theatre continued to be used by the Opera until 8 June 1781, when it too was destroyed by fire. The Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, much further to the north on the Boulevard Saint-Martin, was hurriedly built in two months to replace it. In the meantime the opera company performed in the Salle des Menus-Plaisirs on the rue Bergère.\n\nArchitectural drawings of the second Salle du Palais-Royal (1770–1781)()\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3597669", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3597669", "title": "Times Square Ball", "text": "Times Square Ball\n\nThe Times Square Ball is a time ball located in New York City's Times Square. Located on the roof of One Times Square, the ball is a prominent part of a New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square commonly referred to as the ball drop, where the ball descends in 60 seconds down a specially designed flagpole, beginning at 11:59:00 p.m. ET, and resting at midnight to signal the start of the new year. In recent years, the festivities have been preceded by live entertainment, including performances by musicians.\n\nThe event was first organized by Adolph Ochs, owner of \"The New York Times\" newspaper, as a successor to a series of New Year's Eve fireworks displays he held at the building to promote its status as the new headquarters of the \"Times\", while the ball itself was designed by Artkraft Strauss. First held on December 31, 1907, to welcome 1908, the ball drop has been held annually since, except in 1942 and 1943 in observance of wartime blackouts.\n\nThe ball's design has been updated over the years to reflect improvements in lighting technology; the ball was initially constructed from wood and iron, and lit with 100 incandescent light bulbs. The current incarnation features a computerized LED lighting system and an outer surface consisting of triangular crystal panels. These panels contain inscriptions representing a yearly theme. Since 2009, the current ball has been displayed atop One Times Square year-round, while the original, smaller version of the current ball that was used in 2008 has been on display inside the Times Square visitor's center.\n\nThe event is organized by the Times Square Alliance and Countdown Entertainment, a company led by Jeff Strauss, and is among the most notable New Year's celebrations internationally: it is attended by at least 1 million spectators yearly, and is nationally televised as part of New Year's Eve specials broadcast by a number of networks and cable channels. The prevalence of the Times Square ball drop has inspired similar \"drops\" at other local New Year's Eve events across the country; while some use balls, some instead drop objects that represent local culture or history.\n\nTo facilitate the arrival of attendees, Times Square is closed to traffic beginning in the late afternoon on New Year's Eve. The square is then divided into different viewing sections referred to as \"pens\", into which attendees are directed sequentially upon arrival. Security is strictly enforced by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), even more so since the 2001–02 edition in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Attendees are required to pass through security checkpoints before they are assigned a pen, and are prohibited from bringing backpacks or alcohol to the event.\n\nSecurity was increased further for 2017–18 edition due to recent incidents such as the truck attack in New York on October 31, and the Route 91 Harvest festival shootings in Las Vegas; these included additional patrols of Times Square hotels, rooftop patrol squads and counter-snipers, and the installation of reflective markers on buildings to help officers identify the location of elevated shooters.\n\nFestivities formally begin in the early evening with the raising of the ball at around 6:00 p.m. ET, upon the conclusion of the 20-second “6 Hours to Go” countdown at 5:59:40. Party favors are distributed to attendees, which have historically included large balloons, hats, and other items branded with the event's corporate sponsors. The hours before the drop are preceded by hourly countdowns for the arrival of the new year in other countries, along with live music performances by popular musicians. Some of these performances are organized by, and aired on New Year's Eve television specials which are broadcast from Times Square.\n\nThe drop itself occurs at 11:59 p.m.—the last minute of the year, and is ceremonially \"activated\" by a dignitary or celebrity joined on-stage by the current Mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio; formerly Rudy Giuliani from 1995-96 until 2001-02, and Michael Bloomberg from 2002-03 until 2012-13. The conclusion of the drop is followed by fireworks shot from the roof of One Times Square, along with the playing of \"Auld Lang Syne\" by Guy Lombardo, \"Theme from New York, New York\" by Frank Sinatra, \"America the Beautiful\" by Ray Charles, \"What a Wonderful World\" by Louis Armstrong, and \"Over the Rainbow\" by IZ.\n\nThe current Mayor of New York City has been joined by a special guest, selected yearly to recognize their community involvement or significance, in ceremonially \"activating\" the ball drop by pressing a button, resembling a smaller version of the ball itself, at exactly one minute to midnight. The button itself does not actually trigger the drop; that is done from a control room, synchronized using a government time signal. Special guests who have activated the ball drop have included:\n\nSince the 2005–06 edition of the event, the drop has been directly preceded by the playing of John Lennon's song \"Imagine\". Until 2009–2010, the original recording was used; since 2010–2011, the song has been performed by the headlining act;\n\nAfter the conclusion of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square. When it is re-opened to the public the following morning, few traces of the previous night's celebration remain: following the 2013–14 drop, the New York City Department of Sanitation estimated that it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square in eight hours, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.\n\nThe first New Year's Eve celebration in Times Square was held on December 31, 1904; \"The New York Times\"' owner, Adolph Ochs, decided to celebrate the opening of the newspaper's new headquarters, One Times Square, with a New Year's fireworks show on the roof of the building to welcome 1905. Close to 200,000 people attended the event, displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at Trinity Church. However, following several years of fireworks shows, Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw more attention to the area. The newspaper's chief electrician, Walter F. Palmer, suggested using a time ball, after seeing one used on the nearby Western Union Building.\n\nOchs hired sign designer Artkraft Strauss to construct a ball for the celebration; it was built from iron and wood, electrically lit with one hundred incandescent light bulbs, weighed , and measured in diameter. The ball was hoisted on the building's flagpole with rope by a team of six men. Once it hit the roof of the building, the ball was designed to complete an electric circuit to light a 5-foot tall sign indicating the new year, and trigger a fireworks show. The first ever \"ball drop\" was held on December 31, 1907, welcoming the year 1908.\n\nIn 1913, only eight years after it moved to One Times Square, the \"Times\" moved its corporate headquarters to 229 West 43rd Street. The \"Times\" still maintained ownership of the tower, however, and Strauss continued to organize future editions of the drop.\n\nThe original ball was retired in 1920 in favor of a second design; the second ball remained in diameter, but was now constructed from iron, weighing . The ball drop was placed on hiatus for New Year's Eve 1942 and 1943 due to wartime lighting restrictions during World War II. Instead, a moment of silence was observed at midnight in Times Square, accompanied by the sound of church bells played from sound trucks.\n\nThe second ball was retired in favor of a third design in 1955; again, it maintained the same diameter of its predecessors, but was now constructed from aluminium, and weighed . In 1981, the ball was modified to make it resemble an apple, by switching to red lightbulbs and adding a green \"stem\". For 1988, organizers acknowledged the addition of a leap second earlier that day (leap seconds are appended at midnight UTC, which is five hours before midnight in New York) by extending the drop to 61 seconds, and by including a special one-second light show during the extra second. The original white bulbs returned to the ball for 1989, but were replaced by red, white, and blue bulbs in 1991 to salute the troops of Operation Desert Shield.\n\nThe third ball was revamped again in 1995 for 1996, adding a computerized lighting system with 180 halogen bulbs and 144 strobe lights, and over 12,000 rhinestones. Lighting designer Barry Arnold stated that the changes were \"something [that] had to be done to make this event more spectacular as we approach the millennium.\"\n\nThe drop itself became computerized through the use of an electric winch synced with the National Institute of Standards and Technology's time signal; the new system was not without issues, however, as a glitch caused the ball to pause for a short moment halfway through its descent. After its 44th use in 1999, the third ball was retired and placed on display at the Atlanta headquarters of Jamestown Group, owners of One Times Square.\n\nOn December 28, 1998, during a press conference attended by New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani, organizers announced that the third ball would be retired for the arrival of the new millennium, and replaced by a new design constructed by Waterford Crystal. The year 2000 celebrations introduced more prominent sponsorship to the drop; companies such as Discover Card, Korbel Champagne, and Panasonic were announced as official sponsors of the festivities in Times Square. The city also announced that Ron Silver would lead a committee known as \"NYC 2000\", which was in charge of organizing events across the city for year 2000 celebrations.\n\nA full day of festivities was held at Times Square to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000, which included concerts and hourly cultural presentations with parades of puppets designed by Michael Curry, representing countries entering the new year at that hour. Organizers expected a total attendance exceeding 2 million spectators.\n\nThe fourth ball, measuring in diameter and weighing , incorporated a total of over 600 halogen bulbs, 504 triangle-shaped crystal panels provided by Waterford, 96 strobe lights, and spinning, pyramid-shaped mirrors. The ball was constructed at Waterford's factory in Ireland, and was then shipped to New York City, where the lighting system and motorized mirrors were installed.\n\nMany of the triangles were inscribed with \"Hope\"-themed designs changing yearly, such as \"Hope for Fellowship\", \"Hope for Wisdom\", \"Hope for Unity\", \"Hope for Courage\", and \"Hope for Abundance\". For 2002, as part of the theme \"Hope for Healing\", 195 of the ball's panels were engraved with the names of nations and organizations who were affected by or were involved in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. In December 2011, the \"Hope for Healing\" panels were accepted into the collection of the National September 11 Museum.\n\nIn honor of the ball drop's centennial anniversary, a brand new fifth design debuted for New Year's Eve 2008. Once again manufactured by Waterford Crystal with a diameter of , but weighing , it used LED lamps provided by Philips (which can produce 16,777,216 or 2 colors), with computerized lighting patterns developed by the New York City-based lighting firm Focus Lighting. The ball featured 9,576 energy-efficient bulbs that consumed the same amount of electricity as only 10 toasters. The 2008 ball was only used once, and was placed on display at the Times Square Visitors Center following the event.\n\nFor 2009, a larger version of the fifth ball was introduced—an icosahedral geodesic sphere lit by 32,256 LED lamps. Its diameter is twice as wide as the 2008 ball, at , and contains 2,688 Waterford Crystal panels, with a weight of . It was designed to be weatherproof, as the ball would now be displayed atop One Times Square nearly year-round following the celebrations.\n\nYearly themes for the ball's crystal panels continued; from 2008 to 2013, the ball contained crystal patterns that were part of a Waterford series known as \"World of Celebration\", including themes such as \"Let There Be Light\" and \"Let There Be Peace\". For 2014, all the ball's panels were replaced, marking a new theme series known as \"Greatest Gifts\", beginning with \"Gift of Imagination\".\n\nThe numerical sign indicating the year (which remains atop the tower along with the ball itself) uses Philips LED lamps. For 2014, the final two digits of the sign used bulbs from the company's \"Hue\" line of multi-color LED lamps, allowing them to have computerized lighting cues.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, from 1907 to 2016, the average temperature at midnight in Central Park was . The coldest event was in 1917 when the temperature was and the wind chill was . The warmest temperature was , in 1965 and 1972. It has snowed during the ball drop just seven times out of 111 events (one being light snow)—1926, 1934, 1948, 1952, 1961, 1967, and 2009—and it has rained multiple times. Festivities in 2018 were the second-coldest on record due to an arctic air mass, forecast at ( after wind chill).\n\nAs a public event, the festivities and ball drop are often broadcast on television. As of 2016-17, a host feed of 21 cameras across Times Square is provided to broadcasters to incorporate into their coverage. \n\nThe event is covered as part of New Year's Eve television specials on several major U.S. television networks. By far the most notable of these is \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\"; created, produced, and originally hosted by the entertainer Dick Clark until his death in 2012, and currently hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Jenny McCarthy, the program first aired on NBC in 1972 before moving to ABC, where it has been broadcast ever since. \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" has consistently been the most-watched New Year's Eve special in the U.S. annually, peaking at 25.6 million viewers for its 2018 edition. Following the death of Dick Clark in April 2012, a crystal engraved with his name was added to the 2013 ball in tribute.\n\nAcross the remaining networks, NBC broadcasts \"New Year's Eve with Carson Daly\", hosted from Times Square by Carson Daly of \"The Voice\" and \"Last Call\" while Fox has aired New Year's specials covering Times Square with rotating hosts and themes, which were broadcast primarily under the title \"New Year's Eve Live\" until 2014. From 2015 to 2017, Fox broadcast \"Pitbull's New Year's Revolution\" from Miami instead, but returned to a Times Square-based show hosted by Steve Harvey for 2018. Spanish-language network Univision broadcasts \"¡Feliz!\", hosted by Raúl de Molina of \"El Gordo y La Flaca\".\n\nOn cable, CNN carries coverage of the festivities, known as \"New Year's Eve Live\", which was historically hosted by Anderson Cooper and Kathy Griffin from Times Square. Griffin was removed from her role in 2017 after she published a controversial political photo; she was replaced by Andy Cohen for 2018. Fox News carries \"All-American New Year\", which was most recently hosted by Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Bill Hemmer from Times Square.\n\nSince 2008-09, an official webcast of the ball drop and its associated festivities has been produced, streamed via Livestream.com.\n\nBeginning in the 1940s, NBC broadcast coverage from Times Square anchored by Ben Grauer on both radio and television. Its coverage was later incorporated into special episodes of \"The Tonight Show\", continuing through Johnny Carson and Jay Leno's tenures on the program. NBC would introduce a dedicated special, \"New Year's Eve with Carson Daly\", beginning in 2004.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1976, CBS was well known for its television coverage of the festivities hosted by bandleader Guy Lombardo, most frequently from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, featuring his band's famous rendition of \"Auld Lang Syne\" at midnight. After Lombardo's death in 1977, CBS and the Royal Canadians, now led by Victor Lombardo, attempted to continue the special. However, Guy's absence and the growing popularity of ABC's \"New Year’s Rockin’ Eve\" prompted CBS to eventually drop the band entirely. The Royal Canadians were replaced by a new special, \"Happy New Year, America\", which ran in various formats with different hosts (such as Paul Anka, Donny Osmond, Andy Williams, Paul Shaffer, and Montel Williams) until it was discontinued after 1996. CBS, barring a special \"America's Millennium\" broadcast for 2000, has not broadcast any national New Year's programming since.\n\nFor 2000, in lieu of \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\", ABC News covered the festivities as part of its day-long telecast, \"ABC 2000 Today\". Hosted by Peter Jennings, the broadcast featured coverage of millennium festivities from around the world, including those in New York City. Jennings was joined by Dick Clark as a special correspondent for coverage from Times Square.\n\nMTV had broadcast coverage originating from the network's Times Square studios at One Astor Plaza. For 2011, MTV also held its own ball drop in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, the setting of its popular reality series \"Jersey Shore\", featuring cast member Snooki lowered inside a giant \"hamster ball\". Originally, MTV planned to hold the drop within its studio in Times Square, but the network was asked by city officials to conduct the drop elsewhere.\n"}

The title was inspired by a Spanish song about the war, 'Viva la Quince Brigada'.\n\nMoore wrote this song choosing to focus on the Irish socialist volunteers (who in later years became known as the Connolly Column) who were a small contingent within the 15th International Brigade.\n\nThe song was inspired by Spanish Civil War veteran Michael O'Riordan's book Connolly Column.\n\nMoore said: \"Without Michael O'Riordan I'd never have been able to write Viva la Quince Brigada. I must have performed the song over a thousand times and every single time I sing it I think of Mick and wonder how can I ever thank him enough. In Spain in 1983 I was reading his book, Connolly Column – the story of the Irishmen who fought for the Spanish Republic, and I began this song as I read on. The song was lifted entirely from his book.\n\nMoore's original song title - which translates as \"Long live the Fifth Brigade\" - was a slip due to the similarity in Spanish between \"quinta\" (fifth) and \"quince\" (fifteen). The bulk of Irish volunteers served with the XV (Fifteen) International Brigade; the \"Fifth Brigade\" was not one of the International Brigades. The song later appeared listed as Viva la Quince Brigada as Moore corrected the mistake in subsequent recordings.\nBoth titles are correct however, originally there were ten brigades in the Spanish army, the five international brigades were then added to the list making the 5th International Brigade the 15th Brigade of the Spanish republic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "577562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=577562", "title": "Western betrayal", "text": "Western betrayal\n\nThe concept of Western betrayal refers to the view that the United Kingdom and France failed to meet their legal, diplomatic, military and moral obligations with respect to the Czechoslovak and Polish nations during the prelude to and aftermath of World War II. It also sometimes refers to the treatment of other Central and Eastern European nations at the time.\n\nThe term refers to several events, including the treatment of Czechoslovakia during the Munich Agreement and the resulting occupation by Germany, as well as the betrayal at Abbeville (Anglo-French Supreme War Council) of France and the UK to aid Poland when the country was invaded by Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939. The same concept also refers to the concessions made by the United States and the United Kingdom to the Soviet Union during the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences, to their passive stance during the Warsaw Uprising against Nazi occupation, and post-war events, which allocated the region to the Soviet sphere of influence and created the communist Eastern Bloc.\n\nHistorically, such views were intertwined with some of the most significant geopolitical events of the 20th century, including the rise and empowerment of the Third Reich (Nazi Germany), the rise of the Soviet Union (USSR) as a dominant superpower with control of large parts of Europe, and various treaties, alliances, and positions taken during and after World War II, and so on into the Cold War.\n\n\"Notions of western betrayal\" is a reference to \"a sense of historical and moral responsibility\" for the West's \"abandonment of Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War,\" according to professors Charlotte Bretherton and John Vogler.\nIn Central and Eastern Europe the interpretation of the outcome of the Munich Crisis of 1938, and the Yalta Conference of 1945, as a betrayal of Central and Eastern Europe by Western powers has been used by Central and Eastern European leaders to put pressure on Western countries to acquiesce to more recent political requests such as membership in NATO.\n\nIn a few cases deliberate duplicity is alleged, whereby secret agreements or intentions are claimed to have existed in conflict with understandings given publicly. An example is Churchill's covert concordance with the USSR that the Atlantic Charter did not apply to the Baltic states. Given the strategic requirements of winning the war, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had no option but to accept the demands of their erstwhile ally, Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, at Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam, argues retired diplomat Charles G. Stefan.\n\nMax Hastings states that Churchill urged Roosevelt to continue armed conflict in Europe in 1945 - but carried out against the Soviet Union, to prevent the USSR from extending its control west of its own borders. Roosevelt apparently trusted Stalin's assurances, and he was unwilling to support Churchill in ensuring the \"liberation\" of all of Central and Eastern Europe west of the USSR. Without American backing, the United Kingdom, with its strength exhausted by six years of war, was unable to take any military actions in that part of Europe.\n\nSpecific instances considered to exemplify the concept by historical and contemporary writers include the annexation of most of Czechoslovakia to Nazi Germany under the Munich Agreement of 1938, the abandonment of the British alliance with Poland during the invasion of Poland of September 1939 and during the Warsaw Uprising against Nazi Germany in 1944, and the acceptance of the Soviet abrogation of the Yalta agreement of 1945. In the latter, the Major Allies against Nazi Germany had agreed to secure democratic processes for the countries that would be liberated from Nazi rule, such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Albania.\n\nThere was also a lack of military or political support for the anticommunist rebels during the uprising in German Democratic Republic in 1953, during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, and during the democracy-oriented reforms in Czechoslovakia in 1968 (the so-called \"Prague Spring\").\n\nAccording to Ilya Prizel, the \"preoccupation with their historical sense of 'damaged self' fueled resentment\" towards the west generally and reinforced the western betrayal concept in particular. Grigory Yavlinsky argues that damage to central European national psyches left by the Western \"betrayal\" at Yalta and Munich remained a \"psychological event\" or \"psychiatric issue\" during debates over NATO expansion.\n\nColin Powell has stated that he doesn't think \"betrayal is the appropriate word\" regarding the Allies' role in the Warsaw Uprising. While complaints of \"betrayal\" are common in politics generally, the idea of a western betrayal can also be seen as a political scapegoat in both Central and Eastern Europe and a partisan electioneering phrase among the former Western Allies. Historian Athan Theoharis maintains betrayal myths were used in part by those opposing US membership in the United Nations. The word \"Yalta\" came to stand for the appeasement of world communism and abandonment of freedom.\n\nThe term \"Western betrayal\" () was coined after the 1938 Munich Conference when Czechoslovakia was forced to cede the mostly German-populated Sudetenland to Germany. The region contained the Czechoslovak border fortifications and means of viable defence against German invasion. Germany invaded and occupied Czechoslovakia a year later.\n\nAlong with Italy and Nazi Germany, the Munich treaty was signed by Britain and France - Czechoslovakia's allies. Czechoslovakia was allied by treaty with France so it would be obliged to help Czechoslovakia if it was attacked . The Munich treaty and the subsequent occupation exposed Czechoslovak citizens to the Nazi regime and its atrocities.\n\nCzech politicians joined the newspapers in regularly using the term \"Western betrayal\" and it, along with the associated feelings, became a stereotype among Czechs. The Czech terms \"Mnichov\" (Munich), \"Mnichovská zrada\" (\"Munich betrayal\"), \"Mnichovský diktát\" (\"Munich Dictate\") and \"zrada spojenců\" (\"betrayal of the allies\") were coined at the same time and have the same meaning. Poet František Halas published a poem with verse about \"ringing bell of betrayal\".\n\nThen Member of Parliament for Epping, Winston Churchill said: \"Britain and France had to choose between war and dishonour. They chose dishonour. They will have war\".\n\nOn 5 May 1945, the citizens of Prague learned of the American invasion of Czechoslovakia by the US Third Army and revolted against German occupation. In four days of street fighting, thousands of Czechs were killed. Tactical conditions were favourable for an American advance, and General Patton, in command of the army, requested permission to continue westward to the Vltava river in order to aid the Czech partisans fighting in Prague. This was refused by General Eisenhower, who was disinclined to accept American casualties or risk antagonising the Soviet Union. As a result, Prague was liberated on 9 May by the Red Army, raising the standing of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. According to a British diplomat, this was the moment that \"Czechoslovakia was now definitely lost to the West.\"\n\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s, a complex set of alliances was established among the nations of Europe, in the hope of preventing future wars (either with Germany or the Soviet Union). With the rise of Nazism in Germany, this system of alliances was strengthened by the signing of a series of \"mutual assistance\" alliances between France, Britain, and Poland (Franco-Polish Alliance and Anglo-Polish Alliance). This agreement stated that in the event of war the other allies were to fully mobilise and carry out a \"ground intervention within two weeks\" in support of the ally being attacked. Additionally representatives of the Western powers made several military promises to Poland, including such fantastic designs as those made by British General William Edmund Ironside in his July talks with Marshall Rydz-Śmigły who promised an attack from the direction of Black Sea, or placing a British aircraft carrier in the Baltic.\n\nIn the commentary on the Anglo-Polish Alliance, Polish publicist Stanisław Mackiewicz wrote in his 1964 book \"Polityka Becka\":\n\nEngland does not need the existence of Poland, it has never needed it. Sometimes the British push us to fight against Russia, sometimes against Germany, as happened in 1939, when they managed to keep Hitler away from them for some time. After their so-called guarantees of March 1939, England was not interested in our army, it did not help us financially in our war preparations, and did not have the slightest intention to aid us during Hitler's invasion of Poland (...) The guarantee of Poland's independence, provided by England, was not a guarantee at all. On the contrary, it was a speculation, whose purpose was the fastest possible liquidation of the Polish state. England wanted Poland to fight Germany first, and to lose that war as quickly as possible, so that Germany would finally face Russia.\n\nOn the eve of the Second World War polish government tried to buy as much armaments as it could and was asking for arms loans from Britain and France. As a result of that in the summer of 1939 Poland bought 160 French Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 fighters and 111 English airplanes (100 light bombers Fairey Battle, 10 Hurricanes and 1 Spitfire). Despite some of this airplanes had been shipped to Poland before 1 September 1939, none of them would take part in combat. That can be realted vastly to unnecessary extension of negotiations by France and Britain in the face of war. Due to the resistance of the British, weapons were not sold, on which Poles most cared: about 150 technically advanced fighters Spitfires. The total amount of given loan from British government was also much smaller than asked. Britain eventually agreed to borrow just 8 milion pounds instead of 60 milion that Poland applied.\n\nUpon the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, Britain and France declared war on Germany. On 3 September a naval blockade of Germany was initiated, and an attempt was made to bomb German warships in harbour on 4 September. Most British bomber activity over Germany was the dropping of propaganda leaflets and reconnaissance. On 4 September, during a Franco-British meeting in France, it was decided that no major land or air operations against Germany would take place, and afterwards French military leader Gamelin issued orders prohibiting Polish military envoys lieutenant Wojciech Fyda and general Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki from contacting him. In his post-war diaries general Edmund Ironside, the chief of Imperial General Staff commented on French promises \"The French had lied to the Poles in saying they are going to attack. There is no idea of it\".\n\nThe French initiated full mobilisation and began the limited Saar Offensive on 7 September but halted short of the German defensive lines and then withdrew to their own defences around 13 September. Poland was not notified of this decision. Instead, Gamelin informed by dispatch marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły that half of his divisions were in contact with the enemy, and that French advances had forced the Wehrmacht to withdraw at least six divisions from Poland. The Polish military envoy to France, general Stanisław Burhardt-Bukacki, upon receiving the text of the message sent by Gamelin, alerted marshal Śmigły: \"I received the message by general Gamelin. Please don't believe a single word in the dispatch\". The following day, the commander of the French Military Mission to Poland, General Louis Faury, informed the Polish Chief of Staff, General Wacław Stachiewicz, that the planned major offensive on the western front had to be postponed from September 17 to September 20. At the same time, French divisions were ordered to retreat to their barracks along the Maginot Line.\n\nOn 17 September 1939 the Soviet Union invaded Poland, as agreed in advance with Germany following the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Britain and France did not take any action in response to the Soviet invasion.\n\nFrance and Britain did not launch a full land attack on Germany. Poland was overcome on 6 October.\n\nIn November 1943, the Big Three (USSR, US, and the UK) met at the Tehran Conference. President Roosevelt and Winston Churchill officially agreed that the eastern borders of Poland would roughly follow the Curzon Line. The Polish government-in-exile was not a party to this decision made in secret. The resulting loss of the Kresy, or \"eastern territories\", approximately 48% of Poland's pre-war territory, to the Soviet Union was seen by the London Poles in exile as another \"betrayal\" by their Western \"Allies\".\n\nHowever it was no secret to the Allies that before his death in July 1943 General Władysław Sikorski, Prime Minister of Poland's London-based government in exile had been the originator, and not Stalin, of the concept of a westward shift of Poland's boundaries along an Oder–Neisse line as compensation for relinquishing Poland's eastern territories as part of a Polish rapprochement with the USSR. Dr. Józef Retinger who was Sikorski's special political advisor at the time was also in agreement with Sikorski's concept of Poland's realigned post-war borders, later in his memoirs Retinger wrote: \"At the Tehran Conference, in November 1943, the Big Three agreed that Poland should receive territorial compensation in the West, at Germany's expense, for the land it was to lose to Russia in Central and Eastern Europe. This seemed like a fair bargain.\"\n\nChurchill told Stalin he could settle the issue with the Poles once a decision was made in Tehran, however he never consulted the Polish leadership. When the Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile Stanisław Mikołajczyk attended the Moscow Conference (1944), he was convinced he was coming to discuss borders that were still disputed, while Stalin believed everything had already been settled. This was the principal reason for the failure of the Polish Prime Minister's mission to Moscow. The Polish premier allegedly begged for inclusion of Lwów and Wilno in the new Polish borders, but got the following reply from Vyacheslav Molotov: \"There is no use discussing that; it was all settled in Tehran.\"\n\nSince the establishment of the Polish government-in-exile in Paris and then in London, the military commanders of the Polish army were focusing most of their efforts on preparation of a future all-national uprising against Germany. Finally the plans for Operation Tempest were prepared and on August 1, 1944, the Warsaw Uprising started. The Uprising was an armed struggle by the Polish Home Army to liberate Warsaw from German occupation and Nazi rule.\n\nDespite the fact that Polish and later Royal Air Force (RAF) planes flew missions over Warsaw dropping supplies from 4 August on, the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) planes did not join the operation. The Allies specifically requested the use of Red Army airfields near Warsaw on 20 August but were refused by Stalin on 22 August (he referred to the insurrectionists as \"a handful of criminals\"). After Stalin's objections to support for the uprising, Churchill telegraphed Roosevelt on 25 August and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin and to \"see what happens\". Roosevelt replied on 26 August that \"I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you in the proposed message to Uncle Joe.\" The commander of the British air drop, Air Marshal Sir John Slessor, later stated, \"How, after the fall of Warsaw, any responsible statesman could trust the Russian Communist further than he could kick him, passes the comprehension of ordinary men.\"\n\nVarious scholars argue that during the Warsaw Uprising both the governments of United Kingdom and the United States did little to help Polish resistance and that the Allies put little pressure on Stalin to help the Polish struggle.\n\nThe Yalta conference (February 4 to 11, 1945) initiated the era of Soviet domination of Central and Eastern Europe, which lasted until the end of the Cold War in early 1990s and left bitter memories of Western betrayal and Soviet dominance in the collective memory of the region. To many Polish Americans the Yalta conference \"constituted a betrayal\" of Poland and the Atlantic Charter. \"After World War II,\" remarked Strobe Talbott, \"many countries in the (center and) east suffered half a century under the shadow of Yalta.\" Territories which the Soviet Union had occupied during World War II in 1939 (with the exception of the Białystok area) were permanently annexed, and most of their Polish inhabitants expelled: today these territories are part of Belarus, Ukraine and Lithuania. The factual basis of this decision was the result of a forged referendum from November 1939 in which the \"huge majority\" of voters accepted the incorporation of these lands into Western Belarus and Western Ukraine. In compensation, Poland was given former German territory (the so-called Regained Territories): the southern half of East Prussia and all of Pomerania and Silesia, up to the Oder–Neisse line. The German population of these territories was expelled and these territories were subsequently repopulated with Poles expelled from the Kresy regions. This, along with other similar migrations in Central and Eastern Europe, combined to form one of the largest human migrations in modern times. Stalin ordered Polish resistance fighters to be either incarcerated or deported to gulags in Siberia.\n\nAt the time of Yalta over 200,000 troops of the Polish Armed Forces in the West were serving under the high command of the British Army. Many of these men and women were originally from the Kresy region of eastern Poland including cities such as Lwów and Wilno. They had been deported from Kresy to the Soviet gulags when Hitler and Stalin occupied Poland in 1939 in accordance with the Nazi–Soviet Pact. When two years later Churchill and Stalin formed an alliance against Hitler, the Kresy Poles were released from the Gulags in Siberia, formed the Anders Army and marched to Persia to create the II Corps (Poland) under British high command.\n\nThese Polish troops were instrumental to the Allied defeat of the Germans in North Africa and Italy, and hoped to return to Kresy in an independent and democratic Poland at the end of the War. But at Yalta, Churchill agreed that Stalin should keep the Soviet gains Hitler agreed to in the Nazi–Soviet Pact, including Kresy, and carry out Polish population transfers. Consequently, Churchill had agreed that tens of thousands of veteran Polish troops under British command should lose their Kresy homes to the Soviet Union. In reaction, thirty officers and men from the II Corps committed suicide.\n\nChurchill defended his actions in a three-day Parliamentary debate starting 27 February 1945, which ended in a vote of confidence. During the debate, many MPs openly criticised Churchill and passionately voiced loyalty to Britain's Polish allies and expressed deep reservations about Yalta. Moreover, 25 of these MPs risked their careers to draft an amendment protesting against Britain's tacit acceptance of Poland's domination by the Soviet Union. These members included Arthur Greenwood, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, Commander Archibald Southby, the Earl of Ancaster, and Victor Raikes. After the failure of the amendment, Henry Strauss, the Member of Parliament for Norwich, resigned his seat in protest at the British treatment of Poland.\n\nBefore the Second World War ended, the Soviets installed a pro-Soviet regime. Although president Roosevelt \"insisted on free and unfettered\" elections in Poland, Vyacheslav Molotov instead managed to deliver an election fair by \"Soviet standards.\" As many as half a million Polish soldiers refused to return to Poland, because of the Soviet repressions of Polish citizens, the Trial of the Sixteen and other executions of pro-democracy Poles, particularly the so-called cursed soldiers, former members of the Armia Krajowa. The result was the Polish Resettlement Act 1947, Britain's first mass immigration law.\n\nYalta was used by ruling communists to underline anti-Western sentiments. It was easy to argue that Poland was not very important to the West, since Allied leaders sacrificed Polish borders, legal government, and free elections.\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany, formed in 1949, was portrayed by Communist propaganda as the breeder of Hitler's posthumous offspring who desired retaliation and wanted to take back from Poland the \"Recovered Territories\". Giving this picture a grain of credibility was that the Federal Republic of Germany until 1970 refused to recognize the Oder-Neisse Line and that some West German officials had a tainted Nazi past. For a segment of Polish public opinion, Communist rule was seen as the lesser of the two evils.\n\nDefenders of the actions taken by the Western allies maintain that \"Realpolitik\" made it impossible to do anything else, and that they were in no shape to start an utterly un-winnable war with the Soviet Union over the subjugation of Poland and other Central and Eastern European countries immediately after the end of World War II. It could be contended that the presence of a double standard with respect to Nazi and Soviet aggression existed in 1939 and 1940, when the Soviets attacked eastern part of Poland, and then the Baltic States, and then Finland, and yet the Western Allies chose not to intervene in the war.\n\nThe chief American negotiator at Yalta was Alger Hiss, later accused of being a Soviet spy and convicted of perjuring himself in his testimony to the House Committee on Unamerican Activities. This accusation was later corroborated by the Venona tapes. In 2001, James Barron, a staff reporter for \"The New York Times\", identified what he called a \"growing consensus that Hiss, indeed, had most likely been a Soviet agent.\"\n\nAt the war's end many of these feelings of resentment were capitalised on by the occupying Soviets, who used them to reinforce anti-Western sentiments within Poland. Propaganda was produced by Communists to show the Soviet Union as the Great Liberator, and the West as the Great Traitor. Moscow's \"Pravda\" reported in February 1944 that all Poles who valued Poland's honour and independence were marching with the \"Union of Polish Patriots\" in the USSR.\n\nAt some point of Spring 1944, Churchill had commissioned a contingency military enforcement operation plan (war on the Soviet Union) to obtain \"square deal for Poland\" (Operation Unthinkable), which resulted in a May 22 report stating unfavorable success odds. The report's arguments included geostrategic issues (possible Soviet-Japanese alliance resulting in moving of Japanese troops from continent to Home Islands, threat to Iran and Iraq) and uncertainties concerning land battles in Europe.\n\nDuring the Fourth Moscow Conference in 1944, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and British prime minister Winston Churchill discussed how to divide various European countries into spheres of influence.\nChurchill's account of the incident is that Churchill suggested that the Soviet Union should have 90 percent influence in Romania and 75 percent in Bulgaria; the United Kingdom should have 90 percent in Greece; with a 50-50 share in Hungary and Yugoslavia. The two foreign ministers, Anthony Eden and Vyacheslav Molotov, negotiated about the percentage shares on October 10 and 11. The result of these discussions was that the percentages of Soviet influence in Bulgaria and, more significantly, Hungary were amended to 80 percent.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}
