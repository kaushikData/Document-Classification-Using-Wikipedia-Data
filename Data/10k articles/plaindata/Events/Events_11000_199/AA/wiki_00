In early 2010, the Board of Medicolegal Investigations, which is the governing body of OCME, placed Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Collie Trant, M.D., on administrative leave for undisclosed reasons. Within days, the Board terminated Dr. Trant.\n\nSoon after Dr. Trants' termination, Governor of Oklahoma Brad Henry directed State Health Commissioner Terry Cline to review the operations of OCEM and make a report recommending both operational and statutory changes. In late March, Commissioner Cline released his report on OCME. In his report, Cline recommended both greater oversight authority on the part of the Medicolegal Investigations Board as well as restructuring the organization of OCME. Cline outline three models for possible reorganization but recommended the model that made the most sweeping changes. Under currently State law, the Chief Medical Examiner, who must be a licensed physician, is the executive head of OCME, responsible for all operations and administration of the agency. Cline recommended that State law be changed to establish a non-physician Administrator as head of OCME who would be responsible for all agency operations, with the position of Chief Medical Examiner overseeing all medical operations and reporting to the Administrator. Cline pointed to the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and the Oklahoma State Department of Health as examples of this model.\n\nFollowing the release of Cline's report, President pro tempore of the Oklahoma Senate Glenn Coffee and Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives Chris Benge proposed Senate Bill 738 which would have enacted many of Cline's recommendations, including the establishment of a Transition Coordinator. The Transition Cooridnator, as provided by SB738, was to oversee the transition of OCME from its current location in Oklahoma City to Edmond and received an annual salary of $80,000. SB738 passed the Senate 45-0 and passed House of Representatives 58-40. Following the passage of the bill, Democratic State Senator Debbe Leftwich announced that she would not seek reelection. On the same day, Republican State Representative Mike Christian announced that he would seek Leftwich's seat.\n\nCiting legislative misconduct, Governor Henry vetoed SB 738 on June 6 after being briefed by Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater on his ongoing investigation over political corruption involving the legislation. Days later, DA Prater announced that he had launched a political corruption investigation of State Representative Randy Terrill (R-Moore), State Senator Leftwich and State Representative Christian over allegations that those legislators conspired to use SB738 to create a state job specifically for Senator Leftwich in OCME in exchange for her agreeing not to seek re-election. This, according to allegations, would make way for Representative Christian to fill her vacant Senate seat.\n\n"}

It opened as the New Park Theatre in 1874, and was in use until 1882 when it burned down and was never rebuilt as a theatre.\n\nThe theatre stood on a plot of land 60 x 100 feet (20 x 30 meters). The façade was \"plain and substantial, rather than ornamental.\" It was made of Philadelphia brick with trimmings of Nova Scotia stone.\n\nThe auditorium was 60 x 60 feet (20 x 20 m) with a parquet or orchestra circle, dress circle, and gallery. There were 12 proscenium boxes, six on each side of the stage. The stage was 34 x 60 feet and 52 feet to the girders. The proscenium was 26 feet wide and 24 feet to the top of the arch. The cost of the building (exclusive of the plot of land upon which it stood) was expected to be $100,000.\n\nThe color scheme in the auditorium was French gray, and gold, with lines of red for relief.\n\nThe New Park Theatre, designed by Frederic Draper, was built on the site of a previous theatre from May 1873 – March 1874 by Dion Boucicault and William Stuart at a cost of $100,000. They had previously been involved with the Winter Garden Theatre, which Boucicault left in 1860 and was destroyed in March 1867 in a fire which almost cost Stuart his life. \n\nAn advance description of the New Park appeared in the \"New York Times\" on 31 May 1872. In July 1872 Draper, the architect, put forward an enlarged design. This included buying an adjacent plot of land, whose rightful ownership was mired in litigation. The theatre was meant to open in October 1873 but a deadlock in litigation dragged on for so long that Boucicault and Stuart cancelled the opening. In the end another suitable plot came up for sale, and work progressed. The available artistes were re-engaged. By the end of March 1874 the work was nearly complete.\nBoucicault had been announced to be interested in the management, but withdrew just before the theatre opened: and Stuart teamed up instead with the actor, playwright and theatre manager Charles Fechter to run the house. The New Park Theatre opened on 13 April or 15 April 1874 with William Stuart as manager, and Fechter appearing in his own play \"Love's Penance\", an adaptation of \"Le médecin des enfants\" by Count d'Avrigny. Edwin Booth, who had been with Stuart at the Winter Garden, was fairly scathing about the whole enterprise:\n\n\"Love's Penance\" closed on May 6, 1874, and shortly after Fechter withdrew from the management and retired. Stuart suffered financial embarrassments, and the theatre may have been shut down by the Sheriff on more than one occasion. The house remained closed until the fall of 1874, when John T. Raymond performed Mark Twain's \"Colonel Sellers\" for 100 nights. This was followed by the Grau-Chizzola company in Charles Lecocq's \"Giroflé-Girofla\", and George Fawcett Rowe appeared in his own play \"Brass\".\n\nThe following season Stuart presented Mr. & Mrs. William J. Florence in Benjamin E. Woolf's \"The Mighty Dollar\" which reached its 100th performance on 13 December 1875. Gold medals were struck for the occasion, but the calamitous failure of Oakey Hall (former Mayor of New York 1869–1872) in his own play \"The Crucible\", and an unprofitable production of F. Marsden's \"The Clouds\" early in the winter season of 1876 left him unable to carry on, and Stuart swiftly relinquished control of his theatre.\n\nIn November 1876 Henry E. Abbey took over the management of the house and renamed the New Park Theatre to Abbey's Park Theatre. Abbey was associated with John B. Schoeffel, and later with Maurice Grau in the theatrical management partnership of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau.\n\nThe shows were light comedies and farces; and the theatre saw the beginning of the combination of Stuart Robson and W. H. Crane. Acts like Helena Modjeska, and Thomas W. Keene in Shakespeare (especially Richard III) performed there.\n\nAbbey put on popular successes like \"Our Boarding House\", set in Chicago, by Leonard Grover, starring Stuart Robson, W. H. Crane and William E. Sheridan. It opened on 29 January 1877 and played for 104 performances, running for at least eight weeks to March 1877. Among Abbey's many artistes one of the biggest names was Lotta, a light-comedy star. She was one of the highest-paid actress in America, earning sums of up to $5,000 per week.\n\nBoucicault's \"Dot\", a dramatisation of Charles Dickens's \"The Cricket on the Hearth\" with John E. Owens played at the Park Theatre from 20 January 1879. \"Divorçons\" by Victorien Sardou opened at Abbey's New Park Theatre on 1 April 1882.\n\nOn one of his trips to Europe looking for new stars, Abbey saw Lilly Langtry perform in Edinburgh, and offered her a season in America. Langtry's tour of the US was due to open at the Park Theatre on 30 October 1882, but during the day the building was completely demolished by fire and was never rebuilt.\n\nThe next day the papers implicated Langtry in the misfortune. They declared that the burning of the Park Theatre was the biggest and costliest advertisement ever designed to welcome a star to America's shores. Langtry presented Tom Taylor's \"An Unequal Match\" a week later to capacity houses at Wallack's Theatre instead.\n\nWith Abbey's theatre—and one main source of income—gone, he and Schoeffel invited Maurice Grau to join them in partnership. The theatrical management firm of Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau went on to lease and manage the brand-new Metropolitan Opera House (the 'Old Met') for its opening season of 1883–4. It was a critical success but a financial disaster: Abbey as manager was personally responsible for losses of $250,000.\n\nSoon after Abbey's Park Theatre burned down in October 1882, another New Park Theatre opened at 1331 Broadway in 1883. It was leased by David Belasco, who survived the 1883-1884 season with a new version of his \"The Stranglers of Paris\", adapted form a story by Adolphe Belot. It played at his New Park Theatre on November 12, 1883. Belasco's adaptation of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\" (a 'Tom show') probably also played there. The New Park Theatre was renamed as the Herald Square Theatre in 1894.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The comic only had a print-run of 1,050 issues. A year later, in September 2008, Obama appeared in Erik Larsen’s \"Savage Dragon\" No. 137. This issue featured a variant cover which showed Obama with the Savage Dragon, who proclaims that he is endorsing him for president. The issue sold out four print runs. A month later, the comic was followed up by \"Presidential Material: Barack Obama\" by Jeff Mariotte and in November 2008 with \"Obama: The Comic Book\" by Rod Espinosa.\n\nIn November 2008, two things led to an explosion in popularity of the Obama comic book character. One of Obama's advisers gave an interview to journalist Jon Swaine of \"The Daily Telegraph\" titled, \"Barack Obama: The 50 facts you might not know.\" In the interview, it emerged that Obama collects \"Spider-Man and Conan the Barbarian.\" Then later that month, on November 4, 2008, Obama became the first African-American to be elected President of the United States.\n\nWhen Marvel Comics discovered the president-elect was an avid collector of Spider-Man comics, they decided to have Obama the comic book character be put on the cover of their \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" No. 583 (January 2009), for the story \"Spidey Meets the President!\" written by Zeb Wells. This particular release proved extremely popular and sold out in a matter of minutes. A day after the release, the edition was sold for $300 on eBay. Prior to the Spider-Man story, the president-elect was featured in Secret Invasion #8; this is the first appearance of president-elect Barack Obama in a Marvel comic.\n\nObama the comic book character has been put on the cover and pages of many other comics including \"Savage Dragon\" No. 145 (February 2008) by Erik Larsen and \"Youngblood\" No. 8 (February 2008) by Rob Liefeld.

The town of Ramla lay on the road from Jerusalem to Ascalon, the latter of which was the largest Fatimid fortress in Palestine. From Ascalon the Fatimid vizier, Al-Afdal Shahanshah, launched almost annual attacks into the newly founded Crusader kingdom from 1099 to 1107. It was thrice the case that the two armies met each other at Ramla. \n\nThe Egyptians were led by Saad el-Dawleh, former governor of Beirut, while the Crusaders were under the command of King Baldwin I. Baldwin had only 260 cavalry and 900 foot soldiers under his command, leaving him severely outnumbered by the Egyptian army, why was estimated at 32,000 men by Fulcher of Chartres and downgraded to 3,000–5,000 by modern historians. Upon sighting the Fatimid army Baldwin arrayed his forced in six divisions, commanding the reserve force himself. In the initial attack the first two Crusader divisions were wiped out while the vanguard took heavy casualties too, with Geldemar Carpinel among the slain. The battle seemed to be lost but when the third division was pursued after being routed by the Egyptians, Baldwin ordered a counter-attack and committed his reserve. In vicious close-quarter combat, the Crusaders repulsed the Egyptian forces, who retreated in panic as rank after rank buckled under the force of Baldwin's attack. After pursuing the fleeing Fatimids to Ascalon, Baldwin returned to Ramla to plunder the Egyptian camp. This success secured the Kingdom of Jerusalem against the Fatimid Caliphate's advances for the campaigning season. According to Fulcher of Chartres, who was present at the battle, The Fatimids lost around 5,000 men in the battle including their general Saad al-Daulah. However, Crusader losses were heavy too, losing 80 knights and a large amount of infantry.\n\nThe battle had so nearly been a defeat for the Crusaders, and while the Fatimid survivors fled to Ascalon the remnants of the vanguard that was crushed earlier in the battle themselves fled to Jaffa. So great was the confusion after the battle that around 500 Fatimid troops advanced to the walls of Jaffa, where survivors of the Latin vanguard informed Baldwin's wife Arda that the king and all his men were dead. A letter was immediately sent north to Antioch to ask Tancred, regent of Antioch in the place of Bohemond of Antioch, for assistance. Jaffa did not immediately capitulate, and when Baldwin returned victorious the following day the remaining Egyptian forces quickly scattered.. Ascalon remained in Fatimid hands, however, and a miscalculation would prove very costly to Baldwin when the two sides once again met at Ramla the following year.\n\nEgyptian armies of the period relied on masses of Sudanese bowmen supported by Arab and Berber cavalry. Since the archers were on foot and the horsemen awaited attack with lance and sword, an Egyptian army provided exactly the sort of immobile target that the Frankish heavy cavalry excelled in attacking. Except for the third battle of Ramla in 1105, when Toghtekin of Damascus sent a contingent of Turks to help the Egyptians, the Fatimids did not use horse archers. \n\nWhereas the Crusaders developed a healthy respect for the harass and surround tactics of the Turkish horse archers, they tended to discount the effectiveness of the Egyptian armies. While overconfidence led to a Crusader disaster at the second battle of Ramla, the more frequent result was a Fatimid defeat. \"The Franks never, until the reign of Saladin, feared the Egyptian as they did the armies from Muslim Syria and Mesopotamia.\" \n\n"}

The convention featured floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and collectibles merchants. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with comic book professionals, one of the highlights of Comicon was the Saturday all-night film show. \n\nThe first Comicon was organized by Phil Clarke and was held 30 August – 2 September 1968 in Birmingham, England. The first show attracted both professional and amateur creators of the time, including Alan Moore, Paul Neary, Jim Baikie, Steve Moore, and Nick Landau. It also featured a \"fancy dress\" contest, in which contestants dressed up as characters from the comic books.\n\nComicon '69, held in London, was organized by Bram Stokes, \"Godfather of British fandom\" Frank Dobson, and Steve Moore. Comicon '70 was organized by Sam Plumb and held in Sheffield.

{"id": "263489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263489", "title": "Cattle mutilation", "text": "Cattle mutilation\n\nCattle mutilation (also known as bovine excision and unexplained livestock death) is the killing and mutilation of cattle under unusual, usually bloodless and anomalous circumstances. Worldwide, sheep, horses, goats, pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, bison, deer and elk have been reported mutilated with similar bloodless excisions; often an ear, eyeball, jaw flesh, tongue, lymph nodes, genitals and rectum are removed. \n\nSince the first reports of animal mutilations, various explanations have been offered, ranging from natural decomposition and normal predation to cults and secretive governmental and military agencies, to a range of speculations, including cryptid predators (like the Chupacabra) and extraterrestrials. Mutilations have been the subject of two independent federal investigations in the United States.\n\nThe earliest known documented outbreak of unexplained livestock deaths occurred in early 1606 \"...about the city of London and some of the shires adjoining. Whole slaughters of sheep have been made, in some places to number 100, in others less, where nothing is taken from the sheep but their tallow and some inward parts, the whole carcasses, and fleece remaining still behind. Of this sundry conjectures, but most agree that it tendeth towards some fireworks.\" The outbreak was noted in the official records of the Court of James I of England.\nCharles Fort collected many accounts of cattle mutilations that occurred in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nJohn Keel mentioned investigating animal mutilation cases in 1966 (while with Ivan T. Sanderson) that were being reported in the Upper Ohio River Valley, around Gallipolis, Ohio. \nThe phenomenon remained largely unknown outside cattle-raising communities until 1967, when the \"Pueblo Chieftain\" in Pueblo, Colorado, published a story about a horse named Lady near Alamosa, Colorado, that was mysteriously killed and mutilated. The story was republished by the wider press and distributed nationwide; this case was the first to feature speculation that extraterrestrial beings and unidentified flying objects were associated with mutilation.\n\nOn September 9, 1967, Agnes King and her son Harry found the dead body of their three-year-old horse, Lady. Lady's head and neck had been skinned and defleshed, and the body displayed cuts that, to King, looked very precise. No blood was at the scene, according to Harry, and a strong medicinal odor was in the air. A subsequent investigation concluded there were \"No unearthly causes\" of the death. When the Lewis' called Alamosa County Sheriff Ben Phillips he told them that the death was probably due to \"a lightning strike,\" and never bothered to visit the site. Early press coverage of the case misnamed Lady as Snippy. Snippy was Lady's sire and belonged to Nellie's husband, Berle Lewis. Later press coverage mentions that the horse had been shot in the behind.\n\nDemocratic senator Floyd K. Haskell contacted the FBI asking for help in 1975 due to public concern regarding the issue. He claimed there had been 130 mutilations in Colorado alone, and further reports across nine states. A 1979 FBI report indicated that, according to investigations by the New Mexico State Police, there had been an estimated 8,000 mutilations in Colorado, causing approximately $1,000,000 damage.\n\nIn May 2001, 200 goats were mutilated in Panggang District of Gunung Kidul Regency, Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n\nIn most cases, mutilation wounds appear to be clean and carried out surgically. Mutilated animals are sometimes, though not always, reported to have been drained of blood and show no sign of blood in the immediate area or around their wounds.\n\nGeorge E. Onet, a doctor of veterinary microbiology and cattle mutilation investigator, claims that mutilated cattle are avoided by large scavengers \"such as coyotes, wolves, foxes, dogs, skunks, badgers, and bobcats\" for several days after their death. Similarly, domestic animals are also reported to be \"visibly agitated\" and \"fearful\" of the carcasses.\n\nAccording to a survey taken by the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS), mutilation of the eye occurred in 59 percent of cases, mutilation of the tongue in 42 percent of cases, the genitals in 85 percent of cases, and the rectum in 76 percent of cases.\n\nAccording to Dr. Howard Burgess, nearly 90 percent of mutilated cattle are between four and five years old.\n\nSome mutilations are said to occur in very brief periods. A 2002 NIDS report relates a 1997 case from Utah. Two ranchers tagged a specific calf, then continued tagging other animals in the same pasture. The ranchers were, at the most, about 300 yards (275 m) from the calf. Less than an hour later, the first calf was discovered completely eviscerated—most muscle and all internal organs were missing. There was no blood, entrails, or apparent disturbance at the scene. Independent analysts both uncovered marks on the calf's remains consistent with two different types of tools: a large, machete-type blade, and smaller, more delicate scissors.\n\nThe absence of tracks or footprints around the site of the mutilated carcass is often considered a hallmark of cattle mutilation. However, in some cases, strange marks or imprints near the site have been found. In the famous \"Snippy\" case, there was an absolute absence of tracks in a 100 ft (30 m) radius of the carcass (even the horse's own tracks disappeared within 100 ft (30 m) of the body.) But within this radius, several small holes were found seemingly \"punched\" in the ground and two bushes were absolutely flattened. In Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, June 1976, a \"trail of suction cup-like impressions\" was found leading from a mutilated three-year-old cow. The indentations were in a tripod form, 4 inches (10 cm) in diameter, 28 inches (70 cm) apart, and disappeared 500 feet (150 m) from the dead cow. Similar incidents were reported in the area in 1978.\n\nLaboratory reports carried out on some mutilated animals have shown unusually high or low levels of vitamins or minerals in tissue samples, and the presence of chemicals not normally found in animals. However, not all mutilated animals display these anomalies, and those that do have slightly different anomalies from one another. On account of the time between death and necropsy, and a lack of background information on specific cattle, investigators have often found it impossible to determine if these variations are connected to the animals' deaths or not.\n\nIn one case documented by New Mexico police and the FBI, an 11-month-old cross Hereford-Charolais bull, belonging to a Mr. Manuel Gomez of Dulce, New Mexico, was found mutilated on March 24, 1978. It displayed \"classic\" mutilation signs, including the removal of the rectum and sex organs with what appeared to be “a sharp and precise instrument” and its internal organs were found to be inconsistent with a normal case of death followed by predation.\n\nThe animal's heart as well as bone and muscle samples were sent to the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory for microscopic and bacteriological studies, while samples from the animal's liver were sent to two separate private laboratories.\n\nLos Alamos detected the presence of naturally occurring Clostridium bacteria in the heart, but was unable to reach any conclusions because of the possibility that the bacteria represented postmortem contamination. They did not directly investigate the heart's unusual color or texture.\n\nSamples from the animal's liver were found to be completely devoid of copper and to contain 4 times the normal level of zinc, potassium and phosphorus. The scientists performing the analysis were unable to explain these anomalies.\n\nBlood samples taken at the scene were reported to be \"light pink in color\" and “Did not clot after several days” while the animal's hide was found to be unusually brittle for a fresh death (the animal was estimated to have been dead for 5 hours) and the flesh underneath was found to be discolored.\n\nNone of the laboratories were able to report any firm conclusions on the cause of the blood or tissue damage. At the time, it was suggested that a burst of radiation may have been used to kill the animal, blowing apart its red blood cells in the process. This hypothesis was later discarded as subsequent reports from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory later confirmed the presence of anti-coagulants in samples taken from other cows mutilated in the region.\n\nAs with most disputed phenomena, there are a number of potential explanations to cattle mutilations, ranging from death by natural causes to purposeful acts by unknown individuals.\n\nAfter coming under increasing public pressure, Federal authorities launched a comprehensive investigation of the mutilation phenomenon.\n\nIn May 1979, the case was passed on to the FBI, which granted jurisdiction under Title 18 (codes 1152 and 1153). The investigation was dubbed \"Operation Animal Mutilation\".\n\nThe investigation was funded by a US$44,170 grant from the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, and was headed by FBI agent Kenneth Rommel. It had five key objectives:\n\n\nRommel's final report was 297 pages long and cost approximately US$45,000. It concluded that mutilations were predominantly the result of natural predation, but that some contained anomalies that could not be accounted for by conventional wisdom. The FBI was unable to identify any individuals responsible for the mutilations. Details of the investigation are now available under the Freedom of Information Act. The released material includes correspondence from Rommel where he states that \"most credible sources have attributed this damage to normal predator and scavenger activity\".\n\nPrior to the involvement of the FBI, the ATF launched their own investigation of the phenomenon.\n\nBoth federal investigations were preceded (and followed, to some extent) by a state level investigation carried out by enforcement officials in New Mexico. This investigation reported finding evidence that some mutilated animals had been tranquilized and treated with an anti-coagulant prior to their mutilation. It also contended that alleged surgical techniques performed during mutilations had become \"more professional\" over time. However, officers in charge were unable to determine responsibility or motive.\n\nThe ATF investigation was headed by ATF Agent Donald Flickinger. The New Mexico investigation was headed by Officer Gabriel L Veldez of the New Mexico Police, with the assistance of Cattle Inspector Jim Dyad and Officer Howard Johnston of the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish.\n\nWhile many unconventional explanations have been put forward to explain cattle mutilations, a variety of scientists, veterinary workers, and knowledgeable observers (including farmers and other agricultural workers) have suggested more conventional ideas, most of which revolve around the hypothesis that \"mutilated\" animals died of natural causes and were subjected to known terrestrial phenomena – including the action of predators, parasites, and scavengers.\n\nMissing or mutilated mouth, lips, anus, and genitalia are explained as:\n\nMissing/mutilated eyes and soft internal organs are explained as:\n\nAbsence of blood is explained as:\n\nSurgical incisions in the skin are explained as:\n\nThe hypothesis that natural phenomena account for most mutilation characteristics has been validated by a number of experiments, including one cited by long-time scientific skeptic Robert T. Carroll, conducted by Washington County (Arkansas) Sheriff's Department. In the experiment, the body of a recently deceased cow was left in a field and observed for 48 hours. During the 48 hours, postmortem bloating was reported to have caused incision-like tears in the cow's skin that matched the \"surgical\" cuts reported on mutilated cows, while the action of blowflies and maggots reportedly matched the soft tissue damage observed on mutilated cows. No explanation was made however, for the entire absence of any blood.\n\nExperiments have also been conducted to compare the different reactions of surgically cut hide/flesh and predated hide/flesh to natural exposure. They demonstrated pronounced differences between surgical cut and non surgical cuts over time. This article does not address tearing due to bloating.\n\nSome ranchers have disputed the more scientifically mainstream \"natural causes hypothesis\" on the grounds that the mutilated animals often fall outside of the normal categories of natural deaths by predation or disease. One reason cited is that the animals were healthy and showed no sign of disease prior to death, and were large and strong enough not to be a likely target for a predator. In some cases, ranchers have reported that the mutilated cattle were among the healthiest and strongest animals in their herd.\n\nOther critics of the accepted position include investigators involved in paranormal and UFO research organizations, such as National Institute for Discovery Science which report the discovery of anomalies in necropsies which, they claim, cannot be explained by natural processes.\n\nIt is alternatively hypothesised that cattle mutilations are the result of two unrelated deviant phenomena. The bulk of mutilations are the result of predation and other natural processes, and those with anomalies that cannot be explained in this way are the work of humans who derive pleasure or sexual stimulation from mutilating animals.\n\nAttacks against animals are a recognized phenomenon. There have been many recorded cases around the world, and many convictions. Typically the victims of such attacks are cats, dogs, and other family pets, and the actions of humans are usually limited to acts of cruelty such as striking, burning, or beating animals. However, attacks have also been recorded against larger animals, including sheep, cows, and horses.\nHumans, particularly those with sociopathic disorders, have been found to have mutilated animals in elaborate ways using knives or surgical instruments.\n\nOn April 20, 1979, Dr. C Hibbs of the New Mexico State Veterinary diagnostics Laboratory spoke before a hearing chaired by Senator Harrison Schmitt. Dr. Hibbs testified that mutilation fell into three categories, one of which was animals mutilated by humans (page 25). FBI records did not record the percentage of mutilated animals that fell into this category.\n\nThe standard criminal charge for mutilating an animal, including cattle, is animal cruelty.\n\nClosely related to the deviant hypothesis is the hypothesis that cattle mutilations are the result of cult activity. However, contrary to the deviancy hypothesis, which holds that cattle are mutilated at random by individual deviants, the cult hypothesis holds that cattle mutilations are coordinated acts of ritual sacrifice carried out by organized groups.\n\nBeliefs held by proponents of the cult hypothesis vary, but may include:\n\n\nThe hypothesis that cults were responsible for cattle mutilation was developed in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, a time of growing national concern over cults (such as the Peoples Temple and Jonestown) and ritual satanic abuse (\"Satanic panic\").\n\nIn 1975, the US Treasury Department assigned Donald Flickinger to investigate the existence of connections between cults and the mutilation of cattle. The operation came under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n\nFlickinger recorded a number of 'unusual' incidents and circumstantial evidence, but was unable to find sufficient evidence of cult involvement for the ATF to take further action. Media reports of the time reported his investigation was dropped when it was determined cattle deaths were not a prelude to a co-ordinated campaign against elected officials by cult members.\n\nHowever, there were various reports during the time of menacing groups prowling around mutilation sites. In September 1975, a forestry service employee in Blaine County, Idaho, reported seeing a group of people in black hooded robes. Several cattle were found mutilated in the area the following day. On October 9, 1975, a motorist on U.S Highway 95 in northern Idaho, in an area of frequent cattle mutilation, reported to police that some 15 masked individuals formed a roadblock with linked arms, forcing him to turn around.\n\nPublic interest in the cult hypothesis waned during the 1980s, but interest was maintained by proponents such as the Colorado based television evangelist Bob Larson, who campaigned to raise public awareness of links between cattle mutilations and cult activity through his ministry and radio shows.\n\nAnother proponent of the cult hypothesis is Montana author Roberta Donovan. In her 1976 publication \"Mystery Stalks the Prairie\" she documents the experiences of Deputy Sheriff Keith Wolverton of Great Falls, Cascade County, investigating cattle mutilations with suspected cult involvement.\n\nSince the beginning of the cult hypothesis, law enforcement agents in several states and provinces, including Alberta, Idaho, Montana, and Iowa have reported evidence implicating cults in several instances of cattle mutilations.\n\nDuring their investigations, the FBI and the ATF were unable to find appropriate evidence, including signs of consistency between mutilations, to substantiate that the animals had been the victims of any form of ritual sacrifice or organized mutilation effort. They were also unable to determine how or why a cult would perform procedures that would result in the anomalies reported in some necropsies, or to verify that the anomalies were 1) connected to the mutilations themselves 2) the result of human intervention.\n\nIn most cases, mutilations were either ruled due to natural causes, or the cattle were too far decayed for any useful conclusions to be drawn. Some cases of cult hysteria were traced back to fabrication by individuals unrelated to the incident. In one case it was concluded that claims had been falsified by a convict seeking favorable terms on his sentence in exchange for information. In another case, claims were traced back to local high school students who had circulated rumors as a joke.\n\nIn his 1997 article “Dead Cows I've Known”, cattle mutilation researcher Charles T. Oliphant speculates cattle mutilation to be the result of covert research into emerging cattle diseases, and the possibility they could be transmitted to humans.\n\nOliphant posits the NIH, CDC, or other federally funded bodies, may be involved, and they are supported by the US military. Part of his hypothesis is based on allegations that human pharmaceuticals have been found in mutilated cattle, and on the necropsies that show cattle mutilations commonly involve areas of the animal that relate to “input, output and reproduction”. To support his hypothesis, Oliphant cites the Reston ebolavirus case in which plain clothes military officers, traveling in unmarked vehicles, entered a research facility in Reston, Virginia, to secretly retrieve and destroy animals that were contaminated with a highly infectious disease.\n\nAdditionally, a 2002 NIDS report relates the eyewitness testimony of two Cache County, Utah, police officers. The area had seen many unusual cattle deaths, and ranchers had organized armed patrols to surveil the unmarked aircraft which they claimed were associated with the livestock deaths. The police witnesses claim to have encountered several men in an unmarked U.S. Army helicopter in 1976 at a small community airport in Cache County. The witnesses asserted that after this heated encounter, cattle mutilations in the region ceased for about five years.\n\nBiochemist Colm Kelleher, who has investigated several purported mutilations first-hand, argues that the mutilations are most likely a clandestine U.S. Government effort to track the spread of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\"mad cow disease\") and related diseases, such as scrapie.\n\nTheories of government involvement in cattle mutilation have been further fueled by \"black helicopter\" sightings near mutilation sites. On April 8, 1979, three police officers in Dulce, New Mexico, reported a mysterious aircraft which resembled a U.S. military helicopter hovering around a site following a wave of mutilation which claimed 16 cows. On July 15, 1974, two unregistered helicopters, a white helicopter and a black twin-engine aircraft, opened fire on Robert Smith Jr. while he was driving his tractor on his farm in Honey Creek, Iowa. This attack followed a rash of mutilations in the area and across the nearby border in Nebraska. The reports of \"helicopter\" involvement have been used to explain why some cattle appear to have been \"dropped\" from considerable heights.\n\nIn 1974, a few months after the first spate of alleged mutilations in the US, multiple farmers in Nebraska claimed to witness UFOs on the nights their cattle were harmed. One claimed he saw an object which “looked as if it had a little bluish-green light on each side with a glow surrounding it.” The sightings were hailed by UFO researchers as the first physical evidence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nAt the same time that UFO reports were being filed with law enforcement and larger number of ranchers claimed to see black helicopters around their fields, coinciding with the cattle mutilations. Although some initially thought these were used by cattle rustlers, suspicion soon pointed toward a military operation running out of Fort Riley, Kansas. Reporter Dane Edwards spread the theory that the government was testing cattle parts to develop biological weapons to use in Vietnam, going so far as to write to Floyd K. Haskell during his investigation to accuse agents of threatening him into silence. Vigilante groups were formed.\n\nLocal folklore has attributed the mutilations to chupacabras or similar creatures.\n\n\n"}

The final draft of the Declaration was written by John Dickinson, who incorporated language from an earlier draft by Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe Declaration describes what colonists viewed as the unconstitutional effort of the British Parliament to extend its jurisdiction into the colonies following the Seven Years' War. Objectionable policies listed in the Declaration include taxation without representation, extended use of vice admiralty courts, the several Coercive Acts, and the Declaratory Act. The Declaration describes how the colonists had, for ten years, repeatedly petitioned for the redress of their grievances, only to have their pleas ignored or rejected by the British government. Even though British troops have been sent to enforce these unconstitutional acts, the Declaration insists that the colonists do not yet seek independence from the mother country. They have taken up arms \"in defence of the Freedom that is our Birthright and which we ever enjoyed until the late Violation of it\", and will \"lay them down when Hostilities shall cease on the part of the Aggressors\". The very first sentence of the declaration includes a condemnation of slavery.\n\nIn the 19th century, the authorship of the Declaration was disputed. In a collection of his works first published in 1801, John Dickinson took credit for writing the Declaration. This claim went unchallenged by Thomas Jefferson until many years later, when Jefferson was nearly 80 years old. In his autobiography, Jefferson claimed that he wrote the first draft, but Dickinson objected that it was too radical, and so Congress allowed Dickinson to write a more moderate version, keeping only the last four-and-a-half paragraphs of Jefferson's draft. Jefferson's version of events was accepted by historians for many years. In 1950, Julian P. Boyd, the editor of Jefferson's papers, examined the extant drafts and determined that Jefferson's memory was faulty and that Dickinson claimed too much credit for the final text.\n\nAccording to Boyd, an initial draft was reportedly written by John Rutledge, a member of a committee of five appointed to create the Declaration. Rutledge's draft was not accepted and does not survive. Jefferson and Dickinson were then added to the committee. Jefferson was appointed to write a draft; how much he drew upon the lost Rutledge draft, if at all, is unknown. Jefferson then apparently submitted his draft to Dickinson, who suggested some changes, which Jefferson, for the most part, decided not to use. The result was that Dickinson rewrote the Declaration, keeping some passages written by Jefferson. Contrary to Jefferson's recollection in his old age, Dickinson's version was not less radical; according to Boyd, in some respects Dickinson's draft was more blunt. The bold statement near the end was written by Dickinson: \"Our cause is just. Our union is perfect. Our internal resources are great, and, if necessary, foreign assistance is undoubtedly attainable.\" The disagreement in 1775 between Dickinson and Jefferson appears to have been primarily a matter of style, not content.\n\n"}
{"id": "37099562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37099562", "title": "Declawing of crabs", "text": "Declawing of crabs\n\nDeclawing of crabs is the process whereby one or both claws of a live crab (including king crabs) are manually pulled off and the animal is then returned to the water. It occurs in several fisheries worldwide, such as in the Florida stone crab (\"Menippe mercenaria\") fishery, the north-east Atlantic deep-water red crab (\"Chaceon affinis\") fishery and in southern Iberia, where the major claws of the fiddler crab \"Uca tangeri\" are harvested. Around Northern Europe, an extensive fishery exists for claws of the edible crab (\"Cancer pagurus)\". The practice is defended because some crabs can naturally autotomise (shed) limbs and then about a year later after a series of moults, regenerate these limbs. It is argued that declawing therefore provides a sustainable fishery. Claw removal is also promoted to assist in handling of animals, and to decrease losses through entanglement in fishing nets and cannibalism. Declawing crabs is legal in the UK since revocation in 2000 of the Crab Claws (Prohibition of Landing) Order 1986. One crab that is subject to widespread declawing is the Florida stone crab, for which tourist information is provided.\n\nTo perform declawing, the claws are snapped downward away from the crab. To ensure a clean break along the natural fracture plane, one finger is placed on the basal cheliped joint. With the cheliped fully extended, a quick, firm downward motion normally removes the claw cleanly. The break usually occurs at the basi-ischum between the coxa at the base of the leg and the merus.\n\nIn the 1976–77 trapping season, about 50,000 kg of claws were harvested in the Everglades National Park. This was probably less than 5% of the total Floridian harvest, which has averaged more than 1,000,000 kilograms since 1974.\n\nIn Florida during the 1995–96 to 2004–05 fishing seasons, fishers declawed approximately 10.5 million crabs during each 7-month fishing season. The weight of crab claws landings varied without trend since 1989–90. Peak landings were 1.6 million kg statewide in the 1997–98 fishing season. Statewide landings for 2004–05 were 1.4 million kg of claws.\n\nUnder experimental conditions, but using commercially accepted techniques, 47% of Florida stone crabs that had both claws removed died after declawing, and 28% of single claw amputees died; 76% of the casualties died within 24 hours of declawing. The claws constituted 51% of the total weight of the crabs before declawing. In the wild, where declawed crabs must compete for food, mates, and shelter, and avoid predators, the mortality rate is likely to be higher. Declawed crabs survive by switching from predation to scavenging. The occurrence of regenerated claws in the fishery harvest is low, with studies calculating from less than 10% (1978), 13% (2006), to 20% (2010). Larger, older crabs generally do not survive long enough to regrow their claws, as they are near the end of their lifespan.\n\nMost crabs use their claws for capturing and eating prey. A crab with one claw removed would therefore be disadvantaged in subsequent feeding and a crab with both claws removed even more so. In a study on the effects of declawing on feeding, autotomy induced (declawed) crabs consumed significantly fewer mussels and less mussel mass, but ate more mass of fish (a more readily handled food source). This indicates that the effect of autotomy was a reduction of the ability to feed on mussels, rather than a general reduction of feeding motivation. In a second study, there was no discernible difference in the amount of food consumed by crabs surviving declawing and control crabs. It has been argued that should a crab survive declawing it will not be able to feed effectively and may subsequently die of starvation.\n\nDeclawed crabs show significantly lower activity levels than negative controls.\n\nThere is debate about whether invertebrates can experience pain. Some of the most compelling evidence for pain in invertebrates exists for crustaceans in terms of trade-offs between stimulus avoidance and other motivational requirements. Evidence of the ability for crabs to feel pain is supported by their possessing an opioid receptor system, showing learned avoidance to putatively painful stimuli, and responding appropriately to analagesics and anaesthetics. These all indicate it is likely that crabs can experience pain during declawing.\n\nIt has been argued that because crabs can autotomise (self-amputate) their claws, manual declawing along these natural fracture planes will not cause pain. However, a lack or reduction of pain during autotomy remains to be verified. Moreover, declawing results in a physiological stress response in the edible crab, as indicated by increases in haemolymph glucose and lactate and a decrease in glycogen. This stress is evident both in the short term (< 10 min) and the long term (24 h). Further, declawing is more stressful, results in bigger wounds and causes significant mortality compared to induced autotomy.\n\n"}

Lohengrin Filipello hosted the first contest which lasted approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes. Seven countries participated, with each of them performing two songs. Two jury members from all participating countries cast their votes in secret, based on which song was their favourite.\n\nThis first edition of the Eurovision Song Contest included several procedures that were not repeated in any subsequent edition: Two songs for each country, secret voting, double voting of one country on behalf of another, optional inclusion of the jury members' own represented country in their voting, only \"Grand Prix\" title reception for the winner, and a single male presenter to host the show.\n\nDuring a meeting in Monaco in 1955, members of the European Broadcasting Union discussed ideas to organise a pan-European music competition, taking inspiration from the Italian Sanremo Music Festival. From that meeting, the concept of the Eurovision Song Contest was born. A decision was reached to hold the first ever contest the following year in Lugano, in the Italian cultural region of Switzerland.\n\nLugano is a city in southern Switzerland, located in the Italian speaking canton of Ticino. The 9th largest Swiss city, it is the largest in Ticino and largest with an Italian speaking majority outside Italy. The city lies on Lake Lugano, surrounded by the mountains of the Lugano Prealps.\n\nThe inaugural Eurovision Song Contest took place at the Teatro Kursaal, a casino and former theatre, on 24 May 1956. The theatre, designed by Italian architect Achille Sfondrini, was used for theatrical and musical performances, ballroom dance and other shows. The theatre closed shortly after the last show in April 1997 and was demolished in 2001 to make room for the extension of the Casino. Now known as Casinò Lugano, it opened again on 29 November 2002.\n\nThe programme was hosted in Italian by Lohengrin Filipello, making it the only Eurovision Song Contest to have a solo male presenter and up until the 2017 edition with a male trio, the only edition without a female presenter. The programme lasted approximately one hour and 40 minutes. Although it was mainly a radio programme, there were cameras in the studio for the benefit of the few Europeans who possessed a television.\n\nOnly solo artists were allowed to enter the contest, and their songs were not to exceed three and a half minutes in length, and were accompanied by a 24-musician orchestra, which was led by Fernando Paggi, along with four guest conductors, which came from Belgium, France, Luxembourg and Italy. The interval act, whistling by the Joyeux Rossignols, had to be extended due to a delay in the voting procedure. It had been strongly recommended that each participating country have a preliminary national song contest.\n\nTwo jury members from each participating country travelled to Lugano to cast their vote on the songs, except for Luxembourg which was unable to send juries. The EBU conducted a secret voting and a system allowing the juries to also vote for the two songs representing their own country, as well as allowing the Swiss jury to vote on behalf of Luxembourg. Claims were raised that the Swiss entry won as a result of these procedures. This system was never repeated, as from the second edition of the contest onwards the voting is visible, excludes the jury's own competing country from their voting and includes individual jury members for each country.\n\nWhile the contest was shown and recorded for television broadcasting in certain European countries (as television sets were somewhat uncommon still at this time), no copies have survived, with the exception of Lys Assia's repeat performance at the end of the contest. It is one of only two contests to not have survived completely, along with the 1964 contest (of which the tapes were destroyed in a fire).\n\nSeven countries participated in the first ever contest, each were represented with two songs. Two more countries, Austria, and Denmark were also expected to take part in the contest, but they missed the submission deadline and therefore could not take part. Although it was thought that the had also missed the participation deadline, it was later revealed by the EBU in January 2017 that it was a mythical fact created by fans of the contest. The EBU further went on to explain that the \"Festival of British Popular Song\", a contest created by the BBC for the United Kingdom, was the inspiration that brought in changes to the contest format from .\n\nEach performance had a maestro who conducted the orchestra. The conductors listed conducted both performances for the indicated countries.\n\nExcept for the winning song, the results have never been published. Simon Barclay's book \"The Complete and Independent Guide to the Eurovision Song Contest 2010\" includes a table with what appears to be the rankings, but the author does not give a source. Under the chart he writes that \"the votes awarded have never been disclosed.\" According to writer Jan Feddersen, \"Im Wartesaal zum großen Glück\" was probably voted No. 2 behind Lys Assia.\n\nThe participating national broadcasters sent commentators to the contest, in order to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language. Details of the commentators and the broadcasting station that they represented are shown in the table below.\n"}

{"id": "629600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=629600", "title": "Exsanguination", "text": "Exsanguination\n\nExsanguination is the loss of blood to a degree sufficient to cause death. One does not have to lose all of one's blood to cause death. Depending upon the age, health, and fitness level of the individual, people can die from losing half to two-thirds of their blood; a loss of roughly one-third of the blood volume is considered very serious. Even a single deep cut can warrant suturing and hospitalization, especially if trauma, a vein or artery, or another comorbidity is involved. It is most commonly known as \"bleeding to death\" or colloquially as \"bleeding out\". The word itself originated from Latin: \"ex\" (\"out of\") and \"sanguis\" (\"blood\").\n\nExsanguination is used as a method of slaughter. Before the fatal incision is made, the animal may be rendered insensible to pain by various methods, including captive bolt, electricity or chemical. Without prior sedation, stunning or anesthetic, this method of slaughter causes a high degree of anxiety, although other religiously funded studies contradict these findings. The captive bolt is placed against the skull of the animal, and penetrates to cause tissue destruction in the brain, incapacitating the animal so that the procedure may take place. Electricity is used mostly to incapacitate swine, poultry and domestic sheep, whereas a chemical is used for injured livestock.\n\nContinued pumping operation of the heart during exsanguination increases the rate of depletion, and thus hastens death, by raising the fluid pressure of the blood. Because the heart operates like a positive displacement pump, reduction of blood volume will not affect efficiency of cardiac output—deprivation of blood to the heart does gradually result in diminished function, but concurrently with similar death of other parts in the body.\n\nQuickly after the animal is incapacitated it is hung upside down by its hind limbs and an extremely sharp knife, in an orientation parallel to the ground, is fully inserted through the skin just behind the point of the jaw and below the neck bones. From this position, the knife is drawn forward away from the spine to sever the jugular veins, carotid arteries, and trachea. Properly performed, blood will flow freely and death will occur within seconds. Sheep and swine will reach brain death in under 10 seconds; however, larger animals, notably cattle may take up to 40 seconds to reach brain death. This period may extend to a couple of minutes if complications, such as arterial occlusion, occur. However, the animal's inverted position allows blood to flow more precipitously and thus makes an animal regaining consciousness before it is fully exsanguinated highly unlikely. In any case, animal welfare advisory councils clearly emphasize that the time from incapacitation to start of exsanguination should be prompt; recommending a time under 15 seconds.\n\nBeyond the initial cost of purchasing a captive bolt, continued usage of the method is very inexpensive. The animal is incapacitated for the duration of the procedure, so it is one of the safest methods for the slaughterer.\n\nSlaughter by exsanguination is mandated by Judaic kashrut (kosher) and Islamic dhabihah (halal) dietary laws. The double edged pointed knife is prohibited. Instead, a long knife with a squared off end is used that in Jewish law must be at least twice the width of the animal's neck. The operation of sticking or exsanguination is executed faster than when using the pointed knife, as four large blood vessels in the neck are severed simultaneously. \n\nA 1978 study at the University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover indicates that these traditional methods, when executed as prescribed by the religious authorities, gave results which proved \"...pain and suffering to the extent as has since long been generally associated in public with this kind of slaughter cannot be registered...\" and that \"[a complete loss of consciousness] occurred generally within considerably less time than during the slaughter method after captive bolt stunning.\" \n\nIn Islamic and Jewish law, captive bolts and other methods of pre-slaughter paralysis are generally not permissible, as consumption of animals found dead are regarded as carrion and stunned animals that are later killed will come into this category. \n\nVarious halal food authorities have more recently permitted the use of a recently developed fail-safe system of head-only stunning using a mushroom shaped hammer head that delivers a blow that is not fatal, proved by it being possible to reverse the procedure and revive the animal after the shock.\n\n"}

It is one of the historic theatres of Portugal, and some of the best performers of Portuguese, Brazilian and Spanish drama staged there, including Ary Fontoura, João Villaret, Laura Alves, Procópio Ferreira, and Ruy de Carvalho. Orchestras, tunas, variety shows, political meetings were also common in Garrett history.\n\nThe theatre is named in honor of famed 19th-century Portuguese playwright Almeida Garrett, who got inspiration to write his most famous work \"Frei Luís de Sousa\" after watching a play in Póvoa around this location. The current location is from 1890 and was, by far, the theater with most longevity and social impact in the city and its vicinity. In the middle of the 20th century, with the popularization of cinema, it became known as Cine-Teatro Garrett or Cinema Garrett.\nThe earliest known theatre in Póvoa de Varzim was built in 1793 in Campo das Cobras, location of all early theaters of Póvoa de Varzim. Theater in Póvoa was already common entertainment for beach-goers in the summers of early 19th century. Almeida Garrett most famous work \"Frei Luís de Sousa\" was based in one of those plays he watched in Póvoa. Almeida Garrett was also a personal friend of Povoan Francisco Gomes de Amorim. Early \"Teatro Garrett\" (Garrett Theater) was an initiative from a society of five citizens from the city of Porto, who built an elegant woodwork building on August 22, 1873 in Praça do Almada. In September 4th, 1876, Teatro Sá da Bandeira was built, also using wood frame construction. This venue was located in the intersection between rua do Norte (currently Rua da Alegria) and Largo do Rego (currently Largo David Alves). The popularity of Póvoa de Varzim as a main beach resort, lead to the construction of a permanent edifice for the theatre in 1890, the \"Theatro Garrett\", in an area near the old Sá da Bandeira Theater, which would be the reason for the demolition of the later. All the great and famed Portuguese actors and world fame artists that staged in Póvoa de Varzim transitioned to \"Theatro Garrett\".\n\nIt was a fundamental venue for the Povoan society at the time, with impact felt also in Northern Portugal, that came to Póvoa for sea-baths, and several people watched plays, cinema and concerts in there, for the first time in their lives. Several good-will actions were organized in there.\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Póvoa was the preferential route for the great national and international artists, especially Spanish. it was in Póvoa that the stars of the period initiated their tour in Portugal. It was, in Northern Portugal, the location with more show venues, especially coffee houses with musical entertainment, the \"café-concerto\". Each coffee house brought to Póvoa the best in music, drama, and dance. Garrett Theater was the great theater of this period. The national press highlighted the operetta companies, revue theatrical entertainment and zarzuela that were presented in Garrett. Some of these companies included the Sociedade Artística de Lucinda Simões, Lisbon's Teatro Ginásio and Porto's Teatro Nacional presented in there quality plays, and some premiered in there.\n"}

A top-level cabinet adviser in the German Empire and the Weimar Republic, he negotiated Germany's underwriting of Russia's October Revolution and authored the 1914 September Program which outlined German war aims during World War I. The posthumous publication of his secret notes and diaries played a role in the \"Fischer Controversy\" among German historians in the early 1960s.\n\nRiezler was born in Munich in 1882 to a prominent Catholic family; his grandfather had co-founded the Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank (now HypoVereinsbank, UniCredit Group). He studied classics at the University of Munich and was granted his doctorate in economic history with highest honors in 1905. His prize-winning thesis on the \"Oikonomika,\" a classical Greek treatise once attributed to Aristotle, was soon published. After working as a journalist for the \"Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung,\" a semi-official newspaper, he joined the press section of the German Foreign Office in 1907 and attracted the attention of Wilhelm II. When Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg became chancellor of Germany in 1909, Riezler became his chief adviser and confidant.\n\nRiezler's duties in the chancellor's office concerned primarily, but not exclusively, foreign policy. In 1914 he authored the September Program which proposed as possible German war aims limited annexations, a hard peace for France, and a Belgian vassal state. In October 1917 he was posted to the German embassy in Stockholm to arrange a cease-fire on the Eastern Front, and then to Moscow as the top aide to Germany's ambassador to Russia, Count Wilhelm von Mirbach. Riezler was an eyewitness to Mirbach's assassination by the Left Socialist-Revolutionaries on 9 July 1918, having unwittingly ushered the gunman Yakov Blumkin into Mirbach's presence.\n\nDuring this period, Riezler served as the conduit for German subsidies to the Bolsheviks and personally negotiated these with Lenin's representatives Karl Radek and Alexander Parvus. Riezler later claimed privately that it had been his own idea to transport Lenin in the famous \"sealed train\" from Zurich through Germany to Russia in April 1917.\n\nFollowing the war, Riezler became a staunch supporter of the Weimar Republic. He joined the German Democratic Party, contributed regularly to the pro-Weimar newspaper \"Die Deutsche Nation,\" and served as the Foreign Office's representative during the drafting of the Weimar Constitution. From November 1919 until April 1920 he was chief of cabinet to President Friedrich Ebert and played a central role in suppressing the Bavarian Soviet Republic and the Kapp Putsch.\n\nIn 1927 he was named \"Kurator\" of the University of Frankfurt, to which he attracted a distinguished faculty that included Ernst Kantorowicz, Adolph Lowe, Karl Mannheim, Paul Tillich, and Max Wertheimer. Riezler consequently played a crucial role in the 1930 inception of the Frankfurt School; for example, it was Riezler who recommended Herbert Marcuse to Max Horkheimer. Because of his concurrent appointment to the philosophy faculty, Riezler was also prominent in German philosophical circles. In 1929 Riezler sided with Martin Heidegger during the famous \"Davos encounter\" with Ernst Cassirer and wrote an eyewitness account of this event, \"Davoser Hochschulkurse 1929,\" for the \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung.\"\n\nRiezler was forced out of the university in April 1933 by the Nazis but, having been allowed by them to draw his pension, remained in Germany for the next five years, publishing books on aesthetics and Parmenides.\n\nIn late 1938 he contacted the Kreisau Circle, an aristocratic anti-Nazi faction, and soon emigrated to the United States to accept a professorship in philosophy at the New School for Social Research. He was to remain at that institution until his retirement, interspersed with visiting professorships at Columbia University and the University of Chicago. During this period he became a close friend and colleague of the political philosopher Leo Strauss, who devoted the final chapter of his book \"What is Political Philosophy?\" to Riezler. Noting that Riezler's philosophy was \"shaped by both the influence of Heidegger and the reaction to him,\" Strauss concludes that it \"was ultimately because he grasped the meaning of shame and awe that Riezler was a liberal, a lover of privacy.\"\n\nKurt Riezler returned to Europe in 1954, lived for some time in Rome and died in Munich in 1955. He was preceded in death by his wife Käthe (1885-1952), daughter of the German impressionist painter Max Liebermann. His survivors included their daughter Maria, wife of Howard B. White (1912-1974), a New School professor of political philosophy who had been Leo Strauss's first graduate student; and his brother Walter Riezler (1878-1965), a prominent musicologist, art historian and associate of the Deutscher Werkbund.\n\n\n\n"}

Subsequently, he gained significant media attention, being referred to as \"the world's worst golfer\". Following the 1976 Open, the rules were changed to prevent Flitcroft from attempting to enter again. Undeterred, he regularly attempted to enter the Open and several other golf competitions, either under his own name or under pseudonyms such as Gene Paceky (as in paycheque), Gerald Hoppy, and James Beau Jolley. Flitcroft was married to Jean (died 2002) by whom he had two sons—one of whom caddied for him.\n\nHe is the subject of a biography, \"The Phantom of the Open\", by Scott Murray and Simon Farnaby, published by Yellow Jersey Press in July 2010.\n\nIn his obituary, The Daily Telegraph commented thus:\n\nFlitcroft was born in Manchester on 23 November 1929.\n\nAccording to his unpublished memoirs, Flitcroft took up the game after watching the 1974 Piccadilly World Match Play Championship. Flitcroft had golfing ambitions well above his ability and came to notoriety in 1976 when, posing as a professional golfer, he managed to obtain a place to play in the qualifying round of The Open Championship—despite his previous experience amounting only to some hacking around on playing fields near his home. Flitcroft recalled, \"I was looking to find fame and fortune but only achieved one of the two\". He was inspired to enter the tournament by Walter Danecki, a postal worker from Milwaukee who, after being barred from becoming a professional by the Professional Golfers' Association of America, entered the 1965 Open Championship after telling the R&A that he was a pro and set a two-round score of 221 during qualifying.\n\nWhen he discovered, to his shock, that any amateurs entering competitions had to have an official handicap—something he lacked—he simply declared himself to be a professional. It was in the same 1976 Open that a young new player, the 19-year-old Seve Ballesteros first came to the public's attention. Flitcroft prepared for the tournament by studying a golf instruction manual by Peter Alliss which was borrowed from his local library. He further studied from instructional articles by the 1966 PGA Championship winner Al Geiberger, and honed his skills on a nearby beach.\n\nHis deception (and ineptitude) were uncovered when he managed to card a 49-over-par 121—the worst score in the tournament's history; some of the other professionals playing with him were so angry that they successfully demanded a refund of their entry fees. In addition the R&A gave him a lifetime ban from all their courses. It seems that none of the professionals noticed that his gear comprised only a red imitation-leather bag and half a set of mail-order clubs. As a result of his abilities, he became known as \"The Royal & Ancient Rabbit\".\n\nAfter leaving school, Flitcroft joined the Merchant Navy. Following his marriage, he and his wife settled in Barrow-in-Furness, where he worked as a crane operator at the Vickers-Armstrongs shipyard. At other times he worked as a shoe polish salesman and an ice cream man.\n\nIn a July 2006 article in Golfonline, Flitcroft said, \"I was in show business. I toured with a revue, and I used to jump into a tank on the stage, I was a stuntcomedy high diver. The revue used to tour all the country and I would dive into this tank. It wasn't all glass, just the front so the spectators could see what was going on under the water.\"\n\nAfter his initiation into celebrity golf, Flitcroft briefly became a C-list celebrity and had various golf trophies (usually those celebrating poor play or egregious mishaps) named after him; he also had the distinction of having the \"Maurice Gerald Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament\" named after him by the 1988 Blythefield Country Club in Grand Rapids. Buddy Whitten, Blythefield's head pro stated that, \"It started as a lark, but most people can't break 90 so they relate more to Maurice than they would to a touring pro.\" By the time of the 22nd Maurice G. Flitcroft Member-Guest Tournament, which was held in May 2000, the club had featured a green with two holes so that even the most errant of approaches were potentially rewarded. If this wasn't enough another green had a cup.\n\nIn 1988, Flitcroft himself was flown to Blythefield to play in the event. He is reported as having told the members there that it was the first time he and his wife had been out of the house together \"since their gas oven exploded.\" Whitten further said, \"It was a different sort of experience, I'd never met a crane operator from England. But his game had gotten a little better than I expected. I think he shot in the low 90s.\" Flitcroft said of his performance, \"I wasn't playing too well. Some faults had crept into my swing. But I hit a lot of good shots.”\n\nFlitcroft retired from Vickers in the 1970s and devoted himself to his golf—but was reduced to the ignominy of once again playing on local fields, having been banned from every local golf club after sneaking into their grounds to play without permission.\n\nMany years after his rise to fame, Flitcroft still received post which had been addressed simply to: Maurice Flitcroft, Golfer, England.\n\nIn 2017 comedian and writer Simon Farnaby, who co-wrote a biography of Flitcroft, stated that he was writing a film script based on the book.\n"}

Her parents had enrolled her at the \"Cévenolles\" boarding school in \"4th grade\" after being exposed to negative influences including marijuana at her former junior high school. She was buried on her would-be 14th birthday, November 26, 2011.\n\nOn November 11, 2011, in Chambon-sur-Lignon, in the département of Haute-Loire, Agnès Marin, a 13-year-old student at \"Les Cévenoles\" Boarding School, went with Mathieu Moulinas, another student, who was nearly 18 at the time, to look for hallucinogenic mushrooms in a forest. Once there, Moulinas proceeded to rape and stab Agnès 17 times before finally burning her body with petrol that he had brought to the site previously.\n\nAt his trial before the \"Cour d'assises des mineurs\" that began on June 18, 2013 and was held \"in camera\" for the most part at the request of Salomé F. in spite of the Marins' wishes and during which Mathieu recognized his guilt, the prosecutor criticized the numerous failings of the institutions and asked the jury to not grant the benefit of minority to Moulinas, instead asking for a 30-year sentence and civil commitment, taking into account the fact Moulinas had mental problems.\n\nOn June 28, 2013, Moulinas was sentenced to life imprisonment, a sentence which had not been met against a juvenile since Patrick Dils in 1989 (who was subsequently exonerated in 2002.). His lawyers appealed the sentence the next day.\n\nThe murder was committed during a time when the French public was debating juvenile criminality and recidivism among offenders.\n\nSome in France criticized the several different failures of the judicial system, whether by freeing such a suspect after three months of remand and putting him in a co-ed boarding school or the lack of candor of Moulinas's judicial supervisor about Moulinas's near-expulsion for typing \"pedo sex\" in a search engine.\n\nWhile the prosecution argued the school was aware Moulinas was charged for rape, the school stated they were not aware of the exact reason why he was under investigation. His father said he alluded his son was under investigation for a sexual offense. However, the father of the victim claims that the school was aware that Moulinas had problems involving \"sexual acts of aggression.\" \n\nOn , his life sentence was confirmed by the Appeal Assize Court, ending any possibility of the revision of the rulings on the facts.\n\n\n"}

She rose to fame in late 2000 when she auditioned for the reality television show \"Popstars\" on RTL II. The programme announced that Benaissa had won a place as a member of the all-female pop band No Angels. The group has achieved massive success and went on to become the \"biggest-selling German girlband to date\".\n\nAfter a series of commercially successful releases with the group, Benaissa released her solo debut album \"Schritt für Schritt\" in 2006. The semi-autobiographical album was recorded entirely in German, taking Benaissa's work further into soul, R&B and jazz music, but enjoyed moderate commercial success.\n\nIn February 2010, she was charged with causing bodily harm by German police for having unprotected sex with three men between 2004 and 2006, without informing them she was HIV-positive. In August of that same year, she was found guilty of hiding her HIV status from sexual partners and was given a two-year suspended sentence and 300 hours of community service. In September 2010, Nadja Benaissa officially left the band due to private reasons, leaving the No Angels as a trio.\n\nBenaissa is the second child born to a Moroccan father, Muhamed Benaissa, and a mother of mixed Serbian and German ethnicity with German citizenship, Sabina. Raised alongside her three years older brother Amin, she spent much of her childhood in Langen, Hesse, where her parents worked in the catering business, and she attended the Geschwister-Scholl-Schule.\n\nAt the age of nine, Benaissa began playing instruments, learning the piano and the flute. Her early musical interest grew after having auditioned and won a role in the school stage musical \"Tabaluga\" during her first year at the Dreieich-Schule-Langen. In her early teenage years, she began writing songs, and at the age of 13 Benaissa started performing in several cover bands within the Frankfurt am Main area, eventually winning the second place at \"Jugend musiziert\", a supraregional music contest for youths.\n\nOn 25 October 1999, at the age of 17, Benaissa gave birth to her daughter Leila Jamila, an event which she describes as \"the proudest moment of [her] life\". Although Benaissa and her boyfriend ended their relationship, Benaissa began attending evening classes in pursuit of her Realschulabschluss school certificate.\n\nIn mid-2000, Benaissa, along with thousands of other women, applied for the debut installment of the German reality television program \"Popstars\", a talent show looking to put together an all-female band. Sailing through the selection process, judges Simone Angel, Rainer Moslener and Mario M. Mendryzcki were generally impressed by her performances, which earned her a position in the top ten finalists despite her struggle with dancing choreography. During a special episode in November 2000, jury member Angel eventually disclosed that Benaissa had been selected to become part of the final five-member girl group No Angels. Initially hesitant about signing a recording contract which would force her to leave her baby daughter with her parents, the show's producers remained persuasive and Benaissa eventually agreed on joining the band.\n\nNevertheless, Benaissa decided to remain with the band, and in the following years the No Angels released another two number-one studio albums, \"Now ... Us!\" and \"Pure\", a live album and a successful swing album branded \"When the Angels Swing\", totalling twelve singles altogether – including four-number one singles. Eventually selling more than five million singles and albums worldwide, the No Angels became the best-selling German girl band to date and the most successful girl group of Continental Europe between the years of 2001 and 2003. On 5 September 2003, the four remaining members of the band (Jessica Wahls had left the band following the birth of her first child in February 2003) announced that they would no longer be performing together after three years of continual touring and increasing cases of illness. The release of \"The Best of No Angels\" in November of the same year marked the end of the band, with each member going their separate ways in early 2004.\n\nWhile her former bandmates pursued solo careers in music and television, Benaissa, who had suffered from intense sleep deprivation, decided to focus on her recovered motherhood the following months. In fall 2004, however, she signed a solo contract with the urban music division of Universal Music and started work on her debut album. Encouraged to perform soul and R&B music with lyrics in German language after a 2001 participation in the Sisters Keepers project's single \"Liebe & Verstand,\" Benaissa decided to focus on writing songs with German lyrics only. As a result, she released her first solo single, \"Es Ist Liebe,\" produced by Tino Oac, in September 2005. The Motown-inspired ballad received positive reception from music critics, but failed to reach the top 50 of the German Singles Chart.\n\nIn the fall of 2005 Benaissa went on tour as a supporting act for the German leg of \"Simply Red – In Concert\". Afterwards she prepared the release of her second single \"Ich Hab Dich,\" which was chosen to represent Hesse on the 2nd Bundesvision Song Contest. Benaissa eventually finished fourth with 104 points, while the single entered at number 36 on the German Singles Chart. Two weeks later \"Schritt für Schritt\" was released, yet barely reaching the top 70. In June 2006, Benaissa participated in another non-profit-making aid project when she provided vocals for the Fury in the Slaughterhouse cover, \"Won't Forget These Days,\" released during the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\n\nAlthough Benaissa was preparing her second studio album for a February 2007 release, involving production by German producers Audiotreats, DJ Desue, Loomis Green, MRF Entertainment, and Monroe among others, she decided to postpone the release in favour of a reunion of the No Angels in early 2007. However, as all four band members had settled on the continuation of solo projects, Benaissa entered Berlin recording studios in January 2008 to record fifteen new demo songs, including material she already penned in 2003. According to her MySpace blog, she finished the album recordings with a second session in March 2008.\n\nIn May 2010, No Angels began their five-date acoustic \"An Intimate Evening With\" tour in Munich, their first concert tour in eight years. Benaissa did not take part in the tour as she had called in sick a week before, prompting the remaining trio to re-arrange their set at the last minute. In September 2010, after months of speculation, the singer announced via MySpace that she had quit the band for good, leaving the No Angels as a trio. In her statement, Benaissa claimed she felt that she had become bigger than the group, stating: \"The scandal, the trial – they were overwhelmed by it [...] They'll be fine without me.\"\n\nAlso in September 2010, Benaissa released her biography \"Alles wird gut\", written by Tinka Dippel.\n\nBenaissa gave birth to a daughter in 1999.\nBenaissa was diagnosed with HIV when she was 17 during a routine screening after she became pregnant. She was in a relationship for a long time with Senegalese footballer of French citizenship Abdou Mbodji.\n\nOn 11 April 2009, Benaissa was arrested on suspicion of having had unprotected intercourse on several occasions in 2004 and 2006 without beforehand informing her partners that she was HIV-positive, allegedly infecting one partner with HIV. She was remanded into custody, after a judge ruled there was a danger she might repeat the alleged offence, but eventually released on 21 April 2009, subject to unnamed conditions.\n\nOn 12 February 2010, she was charged with causing bodily harm, an offence carrying a sentence of six months to ten years imprisonment. On 16 August 2010 she admitted in court to having had unprotected sex without telling her partners she was HIV-positive, but denied deliberately causing any infection. Benaissa had unprotected sex with three men between 2000 and 2004. One of her partners became infected with HIV. The victim found out that Benaissa has HIV after speaking with her aunt. He later got tested and found that he had contracted the virus. On 26 August 2010, she was found guilty on one count of causing grievous bodily harm and two of attempted bodily harm and was given a 2-year suspended sentence.\n\n"}

They are secretive and not much is known about the members of the group. The group's skill means that its attacks sometimes go without detection for many years.\n\nThe group, considered an advanced persistent threat, has been active since at least 2009, targeting victims via spear-phishing attacks against government officials' private email addresses, zero-day exploits, and hot-patching vulnerabilities. Upon gaining access to their victims' computers, the group steals economically sensitive information.\n\nPLATINUM succeeded in keeping a low profile until their abuse of the Microsoft Windows hot patching system was detected and publicly reported in April 2016. This hot patching method allows them to use Microsoft's own features to quickly patch, alter files or update an application, without rebooting the system altogether, this way, they can maintain the data they have stolen while masking their identity.\n\nIn June 2017, PLATINUM became notable for exploiting the serial over LAN (SOL) capabilities of Intel's Active Management Technology to perform data exfiltration.\n\nOnce in control of a target's computer, PLATINUM actors can move through the target's network using specially built malware which is either made by one of the multiple teams they are believed to have or sold through an outside source 2009.\n\nBecause of the diversity of this malware, which has little code in common, Microsoft's investigators taxonomised it into families.\n\nThe piece of malware most widely-used by PLATINUM was nicknamed Dispind by Microsoft. This piece of malware can install a keylogger, a piece of software that records (and may also be able to inject) keystrokes.\n\nPLATINUM also uses other malware like \"JPIN\" which installs itself into the %appdata% folder of a computer so that it can obtain information, load a keylogger, download files and updates, and perform other tasks like extracting files that could contain sensitive information.\n\n\"Adbupd\" is another malware program utilised by PLATINUM, and is similar to the two previously mentioned. It is known for its ability to support plugins, so it can be specialised, making it versatile enough to adapt to various protection mechanisms.\n\nIn 2017, Microsoft reported that PLATINUM had begun to exploit a feature of Intel CPUs. The feature in question is Intel's AMT Serial-over-LAN (SOL), which allows a user to remotely control another computer, bypassing the host operating system of the target, including firewalls and monitoring tools within the host operating system.\n\nMicrosoft advises users to apply all of their security updates to minimize vulnerabilities and to keep highly sensitive data out of large networks. Because PLATINUM targets organizations, companies and government branches to acquire trade secrets, anyone working in or with such organizations can be a target for the group.\n\n"}

Occurring in April and November, the event attracts local and international fashion designers, such as Thierry Mugler and Anna Fendi. In addition to runway shows, seminars and exhibits, the \"Fashion Talent Design Competition\" helps promote young Serbian designers by showcasing their collections. The seven day festival also highlights the works of applied artists, musicians, interior decorators, multimedia experts and architects. \n\nThe fashion show portion is often held at the Congress Centre Master of the Novi Sad Fair, a multi-functional venue situated near the center of the city. Other locations are used as well, for the opening shows, concerts, and art exhibits. Each year, about 30,000 visitors attend with approximately 60 fashion designers, from 20 different countries, presenting their collections. \n\nPartially sponsored by the municipal government, Serbia Fashion Week was founded in 2013 by current head Svetlana Horvat. Having worked as a womenswear designer, she is also the current president of the National Serbian Chamber of Fashion. \nOn October 31, 2013, Horvat made the fashion week official by signing the \"Protocol on Cooperation\" with the national Fashion Councils of eight other European countries.\n\nThe event's main objective is to present Serbian talent alongside designers from established European fashion capitals. Other goals include encouraging the local textile and manufacturing industries, as well as promoting tourism in the area.\n\nThe very first Serbia Fashion Week took place from October 31st to November 2nd, 2013. It featured designers from Serbia, the Netherlands, Hungary, Bulgaria, among others. French designer Eymeric François opened the show and Marcellous L. Jones, owner of \"Fashion Insider TV\", acted as adviser for the event. Two main themes defined the festival, High Fashion and Urban Fashion, with runway shows held at locations such as the Assembly of Vojvodina. A conference on fashion branding also took place at the assembly building. About 2,500 visitors attended the first festival in 2013. As part of the \"Designer Exchange\" program, local talent Biljana Tipsarević was later able to represent Serbia at Malta Fashion Week.\nThe special guest of honour, at the October 2014 edition, was Maastricht mayor, Onno Hoes, who participated in the Fashion Educational Conference Series. He spoke about the role of city governments in helping fashion events evolve. The opening ceremony took place at the Eđšeg chateau. Local designers, who presented their collections, included Verica Rakocević, Marija Šabić, Zvonko Marković, Bata Spasojević, and Milena Radović. That same year, Dutch designers began regularly showing their clothing lines, after a cooperation agreement between Serbia Fashion Week and FashionClash festival. Art exhibits included the works of French photographer Thomas Devaux and Serbian sculptor Vladimir Labat Rovnjev. The festival saw 14,000 visitors in 2014.\nInspired by David Bowie, one runway show in April 2015 was called \"Heros\" and spotlighted about 20 Serbian designers. Italian Vogue covered the event's spring edition, mentioning local talents Zorana Milicic and Marija Stankovic. French designer Eymeric François also participated, presenting his collection on the second day. A seminar on \"Digital Marketing in the Fashion Industry\" took place as well. At the November show, the awards ceremony was held at the Petrovaradin Fortress, with presentations made by fashion critic Marcellous L.

International designers at the show included German Isabell De Hellerin and Slovenian Nika Ravnik, as well as Lesia Semi from the Ukraine. Prizes were handed out at the French embassy in Belgrade, with jury members consisting of fashion expert Donald Potard and designer Anna Fendi. Fendi also visited Novi Sad to promote her new selection of wines from her AFV label.

A part of the English traditional Shrovetide celebrations of the week before Lent, the Monday precedes Shrove Tuesday. As the Monday before Ash Wednesday, it is part of diverse Carnival celebrations which take place in many parts of the Christian world, from Greece, to Germany, to the Mardi Gras and Carnival of the Americas.\n\nThe word \"shrove\" is the past tense of the English verb \"shrive\", which means to obtain absolution for one's sins by way of confession and doing penance. Thus Shrovetide gets its name from the shriving that English Christians were expected to do prior to receiving absolution immediately before Lent begins. Shrove Tuesday is the last day of \"shrovetide\", somewhat analogous to the \"Carnival\" tradition that developed separately in countries of Latin Europe. The terms \"Shrove Monday\" and \"Shrove Tuesday\" are no longer widely used in the United States or Canada outside of liturgical traditions, such as in the Lutheran, Anglican, and Roman Catholic Churches.\n\nThe British name Collopy Monday is after the traditional dish of the day, consisting of slices of leftover meat (collops of bacon) along with eggs. It is eaten for breakfast and is part of the traditional Lenten preparations. In addition to providing a little meat, the collopys were also the source of the fat for the following day's pancakes. \n\nIn east Cornwall, it is sometimes called Peasen Monday or Paisen Monday after the custom of eating pea soup on that day.\n\nShrove Monday is part of the German, Danish, and Austrian Carnival calendar, called Rosenmontag. In the Rhineland, as part of the pre-lenten Fasching festival (or Feast of Fools), it is part of the parade season, a day of marching, revelry, and satirical floats. In the Carnival in Denmark, it is called Fastelavn.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar (most years falling later than the Western Church, usually in March), the start of (Eastern) Lent is called Clean Monday. This is not identical to Shrove Monday, which precedes the start of (Western) Lent by two days. Clean Monday is the first day of \"Great Lent\", and is traditionally considered the beginning of spring in Greece and Cyprus, where it is a Bank Holiday. Different traditions take place in different localities. In the town of Tyrnavos, for instance, feasts are followed by songs and dances with Bacchic overtones.\n\nIn the 19th-century Trinidad and Tobago Carnival, a \"kambule\" (procession of people holding torches) took place in the earliest hours of Shrove Monday.\n\nThe Shrove Monday events of the New Orleans and Mississippi Gulf Coast Mardi Gras, dating back to the 19th century, have since the late 20th century been named Lundi Gras (\"Fat Monday\").\n\n"}

The landing gear compartment is not equipped with heating, pressure or oxygen, which are vital for survival at a high altitude. According to experts, at , hypoxia causes lightheadedness, weakness, vision impairment and tremors. By the oxygen level of the blood drops and the person will struggle to stay conscious. Above their lungs would need artificial pressure to operate normally. The temperature could drop as low as which causes severe hypothermia. Those stowaways who managed to not be crushed by the retracting undercarriage or killed by the deadly conditions would most likely be unconscious when the compartment door re-opens during the approach and fall several thousand feet to their deaths.\n\nDavid Learmount, an aviation expert of Flight International, told \"BBC\" about a lot of ignorance in this area. He suggested that no one would be willing to risk such journey, having full understanding of this kind of ordeal. Stowaways who survived usually traveled relatively short distances or at a low altitude. Two cases are known of people who survived at an altitude of about  – a man on an 8-hour flight, whose body core temperature fell to , and a 16-year-old boy who was unharmed by a 5.5 hour flight, despite losing consciousness. Almost all aircraft stowaways are male.\n\nIn one reported case, in 2003, a young man mailed himself in a large box and had it shipped on UPS planes from New York City to Texas. He survived because the box travelled in a pressurized hold of an aircraft.\n\nFrom 1947 until September 2012, there were 96 known stowaway attempts worldwide in wheel wells of 85 separate flights, which resulted in 73 deaths with only 23 survivors.\n\nStowaways may risk being fined or imprisoned, since it is illegal in most jurisdictions to embark on aircraft, boats or trains as stowaways. Airports, sea ports and train stations are typically marked as \"no trespassing\" or \"private property\" zones to anyone but customers and employees. Seaports, train stations, and airports often attempt further security by designating restricted areas with signs saying \"Authorized Personnel Only\".\n\nSince the September 11 attacks, it has become more difficult to be a stowaway on board transportation arriving to or departing from the United States. Airport security has dramatically increased, and among the new security measures is trained professionals watching over the fences from which stowaways usually gain entrance to an airport's runway.\n\nSome illegal immigrants travel around Europe in trucks and trains without being detected. A number of them try to get to other European countries, such as France and the United Kingdom.\n\nStowaways on sailing ships and on steamships made this way of illicit travel known throughout the world. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries impecunious (poor) would-be emigrants and travelers seeking adventure for no cost helped to make it seem romantic. Noted stowaways to America by steamship have included Henry Armetta, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, Willem de Kooning and Jan Valtin.\n\nThe word takes its origin with the expression \"stow away\".\n\nThis \"stow away\" expression is old and was used for things (such as food), such usage is seen for instance in the 1699 book \"A New Voyage Round the World, Volume 1\" or 1647 \"Journals of the House of Lords, Volume 10\".\n\nThe word was also used (later) for people. This gave names such as \"stow-aways\", when the correct current name in modern English language is \"stowaway\".\n\nDepending on the circumstances, people were stowed away in order to hide themselves, or to be transported as slaves.\n\nThe concept of people hiding is not so recent; it was yet forbidden (and so known) in 1748 by king of Spain, under the \"polizón\" denomination.\n\nThe US legislation set up a stowaway concept in 1850. Previously, entry on the territory was free. and the \"stowaway\" word might be older.\n\nIn 1891, the new US legislation requires the boat to pay the return travel for people not admitted in US, even if stowaway were still admitted.\n\n474 stowaways arrived in US in fiscal year 1910, and 528, next year.\n\nIn 1917, a new legislation defines a list of excludable aliens including stowaways.\n\nSeveral stowaways arrived in United States by boat during the first half of twentieth century; they were paying for 25 to 30 dollars to travel.\n\nSome stowaways were famous such as Hugh Todd.\n\nThe Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic, 1965, as amended, (The FAL Convention), define stowaway as \"A person who is secreted on a ship, or in cargo which is subsequently loaded on the ship, without the consent of the shipowner or the master or any other responsible person and who is detected on board the ship after it has departed from a port, or in the cargo while unloading it in the port of arrival, and is reported as a stowaway by the master to the appropriate authorities\".\n\nUnnoticed by the captain, crew, port officials and customs authorities, stowaways may gain access to a ship with or without the assistance of port personnel. Once on board the ship, stowaways hide in empty containers, cargo holds, tanks, tunnels, behind false panels, stores, accommodation areas, engine rooms, void spaces, cranes and chain lockers.\n\nThe presence of stowaways on board ships may bring serious consequences for ships and, by extension, to the shipping industry as a whole; the ship could be delayed in port; the repatriation of stowaways can be a very complex and costly procedure involving masters, shipowners, port authorities and agents, and the life of stowaways could be endangered as they may spent several days hidden, with the risk of suffocation and without any food or water.\n\n\n"}

In culinary contexts, a suckling pig is slaughtered between the ages of two and six weeks. It is traditionally cooked whole, often roasted, in various cuisines. It is usually prepared for special occasions and gatherings.\n\nThe meat from suckling pig is pale and tender and the cooked skin is crisp and can be used for pork rinds. The texture of the meat can be somewhat gelatinous due to the amount of collagen in a young pig.\nThere are many ancient recipes for suckling pig from Roman and Chinese cuisine. Since the pig is one of the first animals domesticated by human beings for slaughter, many references to pigs are found in human culture. The suckling pig, specifically, appears in early texts such as the sixth-century Salic law. As an example of a law governing the punishment for theft, Title 2, article 1, is, in Latin, \"Si quis porcellum lactantem furaverit, et ei fuerit adprobatum (malb. chrane calcium hoc est) CXX dinarios qui faciunt solidos III culpabilis iudicetur\". \"If someone has stolen a suckling pig and this is proven against him, the guilty party will be sentenced to 120 denarii which adds up to three solidus (Latin coins).\" The words \"chrane calcium\" are written in Frankish; \"calcium\" (or \"galza\" in other manuscripts) is the gloss for \"suckling pig\"; \"porcellum lactantem\". These glosses in Frankish, the so-called \"Malberg-Glossen\", are considered the earliest attested words in Old Dutch.\n\nThere are various preparations for suckling pig in Western and Asian cuisines. The most popular preparation can be found in northern Spain, namely Segovia.\n\nLechón is a pork dish in several regions of the world, most specifically Spain and its former colonial possessions. The word \"lechón\" originated from the Spanish term \"leche\" (milk), alluding to the immaturity of the piglet. Lechón is a popular item in the cuisine in Los Angeles, Spain, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Ecuador, Perú, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, and other Spanish-speaking nations in Latin America. In Spanish cuisine, cochinillo asado is common used to refer to roast piglet, as lechón has drifted linguistically to mean any roasted pig. In most of these regions, lechón is prepared throughout the year for special occasions, during festivals, and the Thankshgiving. \n\nAfter seasoning, the piglet is cooked by skewering the entire animal, entrails removed, on a large stick and cooking it in a pit filled with charcoal. The piglet is placed over the charcoal, and the stick or rod it is attached to is turned in a rotisserie action.\n\nIn Asia, roast suckling pig is eaten in Chinese or Vietnamese restaurants for important parties. It is also a popular dish at wedding dinners or a party for a baby's completion of its first month of life.\n\nIn the former Spanish colony of the Philippines, lechón (Filipino: \"litsón\") is considered a national dish. As the usage of the term has evolved over the years, \"lechón\" has now come to refer to roasted pig in general (including suckling pigs). Suckling pigs in the country are referred to as \"lechón de leche\", which corresponds to the term \"cochinillo\" in Spain.\n\nThere is also variant of suckling pig among the Indonesian non-Muslim ethnic groups, such as the Balinese, Batak, and Minahasa. Some pork dishes are also influenced by ethnic Chinese.\n\nThe European cuisines of Romania, Portugal (\"leitão\"), Spain, Germany, Austria, Albania, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Macedonia and Georgia favor it highly as well. It also accompanies goose as the traditional Christmas feast of families in Russia and Serbia. Russian Navy maintains a tradition of presenting a roast piglet (or several) to the crew of a ship returning from deployment.\n\nSuckling pig is known in German and Austrian cuisine as Spanferkel. It can be roasted in the oven or grilled, and is often served at festive occasions such as Oktoberfest.\n\nIn Sweden suckling pig is called spädgris, it is usually cooked in the oven, or sometimes roasted directly over the fire. It is often stuffed with various fruits such as apples and plums, together with butter and breadcrumbs.\n\nThe suckling pig is used in Cajun cuisine in the southern U.S., where the \"Cochon de Lait\" festival is held annually in the small town of Mansura, Louisiana. During this festival, as its name implies, suckling pigs are roasted. Other uses for the suckling pig in the U.S. include slow roasting in an oven or (as in a Hawaiian-style pig roast) in a pit. The latter remains popular in the cuisine of the Southern United States.\n\n"}

Haruhisa Handa and Conal Coad, guest artists had co-starred in Verdi’s opera “Nabucco\", who had been acquainted with each other prior to the performance. During the performance intermission, Haruhisa Handa gave an interpretation of the classical pieces.\nKiri Te Kanawa greeted the audience with an expression of her joy to have been able to visit Japan and perform. Her appearance in this concert was of surprise.\n\n\n\n\nThe concert was held at the Opera Palace, New National Theatre Tokyo on June 18, 2014. In addition to the 1,500 people in the audience who had won their tickets by a drawing of (5,800 applicants), 300 people including students of music colleges located in Japan were also invited.

The Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra accompanied the performance.\n\nHanda formed a close friendship with Fleming with a personal introduction from his friend, Michael Bolton which consequently led to her third visit to Japan after an absence of eight years. Handa and Fleming, based on their shared conviction that music is entertainment and their purpose is just to make the audience content, that being said they had then carefully selected the pieces for the performance.\n\nThe concert was under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The Tokyo Metropolis and the Embassy of the United States in Tokyo. Congratulatory telegrams were sent from Shinzo Abe (Prime Minister of Japan), Fumio Kishida (Foreign Minister), Hakubun Shimomura (Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), Yukio Hatoyama and Yoichi Masuzoe (Governor of Tokyo Metropolis).\n\nHanda told audience during his greetings that he wished them to listen to the mature vocal performance of a worldwide top ranked soprano. Fleming expressed her gratitude, saying “I have always been on tour singing, but now I feel so happy to be in Japan again”.\n\nIt was announced that Handa will assume the post of co-chair of organizing committee of the music festival to be held in New York City, New York featuring Fleming in 2015.\n\n\nThe encore consisted of duet by Fleming and Handa, Fleming’s solo, and a trio of “Furusato” by all three of the artists with a wish for the recovery from horrific damage due to the Great East Japan earthquake. It was reported that many of the audience were brought to tears. According to Handa at his suggestion, was to have Fleming sing the song that all Japanese know which she accepted, and which then lead to the trio.\n\nInternational Foundation for Arts and Culture, a special nonprofit incorporation.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "54741", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54741", "title": "Tony Award", "text": "Tony Award\n\nThe Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Broadway Theatre, more commonly known as the Tony Award, recognizes excellence in live Broadway theatre. The awards are presented by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League at an annual ceremony in New York City. The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances, and an award is given for regional theatre. Several discretionary non-competitive awards are also given, including a Special Tony Award, the Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre, and the Isabelle Stevenson Award. The awards are named after Antoinette \"Tony\" Perry, co-founder of the American Theatre Wing.\n\nThe rules for the Tony Awards are set forth in the official document \"Rules and Regulations of The American Theatre Wing's Tony Awards\", which applies for that season only. The Tony Awards are considered the highest U.S. theatre honor, the New York theatre industry's equivalent to the Academy Awards (Oscars) for film, the Emmy Awards for television, and the Grammy Awards for music. It also forms the fourth spoke in the EGOT, that is, someone who has won all four awards. The Tony Awards are also considered the equivalent of the Laurence Olivier Awards in the United Kingdom and the Molière Awards in France.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2010, the Tony Awards ceremony was held at Radio City Music Hall in New York City in June and broadcast live on CBS television, except in 1999, when it was held at the Gershwin Theatre. In 2011 and 2012, the ceremony was held at the Beacon Theatre. From 2013 to 2015, the 67th, 68th, and 69th ceremonies returned to Radio City Music Hall. The 70th Tony Awards was held on June 12, 2016 at the Beacon Theatre. The 71st Tony Awards and 72nd Tony Awards were held at Radio City Music Hall in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\n, there are 26 categories of awards, plus several special awards. Starting with 11 awards in 1947, the names and number of categories have changed over the years. Some examples: the category Best Book of a Musical was originally called \"Best Author (Musical)\". The category of Best Costume Design was one of the original awards. For two years, in 1960 and 1961, this category was split into Best Costume Designer (Dramatic) and Best Costume Designer (Musical). It then went to a single category, but in 2005 it was divided again. For the category of Best Director of a Play, a single category was for directors of plays and musicals prior to 1960.\n\nA newly established non-competitive award, The Isabelle Stevenson Award, was given for the first time at the awards ceremony in 2009. The award is for an individual who has made a \"substantial contribution of volunteered time and effort on behalf of one or more humanitarian, social service or charitable organizations\".\n\nThe category of Best Special Theatrical Event was retired as of the 2009–2010 season. The categories of Best Sound Design of a Play and Best Sound Design of a Musical were retired as of the 2014-2015 season. On April 24, 2017, the Tony Awards administration committee announced that the Sound Design Award would be reintroduced for the 2017-2018 season.\n\nPerformance categories\n\nShow and technical categories\n\nSpecial awards\n\nRetired awards\n\nThe award was founded in 1947 by a committee of the American Theatre Wing headed by Brock Pemberton. The award is named after Antoinette Perry, nicknamed Tony, an actress, director, producer and co-founder of the American Theatre Wing, who died in 1946. As her official biography at the Tony Awards website states, \"At <nowiki>[</nowiki>Warner Bros. story editor] Jacob Wilk's suggestion, [Pemberton] proposed an award in her honor for distinguished stage acting and technical achievement. At the initial event in 1947, as he handed out an award, he called it a Tony. The name stuck.\"\n\nThe first awards ceremony was held on April 6, 1947, at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City. The first prizes were \"a scroll, cigarette lighter and articles of jewelry such as 14-carat gold compacts and bracelets for the women, and money clips for the men.\" It was not until the third awards ceremony in 1949 that the first Tony medallion was given to award winners. Awarded by a panel of approximately 868 voters (as of 2014) from various areas of the entertainment industry and press.\n\nSince 1967, the award ceremony has been broadcast on U.S. national television and includes songs from the nominated musicals, and occasionally has included video clips of, or presentations about, nominated plays. The American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League jointly present and administer the awards. Audience size for the telecast is generally well below that of the Academy Awards shows, but the program reaches an affluent audience, which is prized by advertisers. According to a June 2003 article in \"The New York Times\": \"What the Tony broadcast does have, say CBS officials, is an all-important demographic: rich and smart. Jack Sussman, CBS's senior vice president in charge of specials, said the Tony show sold almost all its advertising slots shortly after CBS announced it would present the three hours. 'It draws upscale premium viewers who are attractive to upscale premium advertisers,' Mr. Sussman said...\" The viewership has declined from the early years of its broadcast history (for example, the number of viewers in 1974 was 20,026,000, in 1999 9,155,000) but has settled into between six and eight million viewers for most of the decade of the 2000s. In contrast, the 2009 Oscar telecast had 36.3 million viewers.\n\nThe Tony Award medallion was designed by art director Herman Rosse and is a mix of mostly brass and a little bronze, with a nickel plating on the outside; a black acrylic glass base, and the nickel-plated pewter swivel. The face of the medallion portrays an adaptation of the comedy and tragedy masks. Originally, the reverse side had a relief profile of Antoinette Perry; this later was changed to contain the winner's name, award category, production and year. The medallion has been mounted on a black base since 1967.\n\nA larger base was introduced in time for the 2010 award ceremony. The new base is slightly taller , up from and heavier , up from . This change was implemented to make the award \"feel more substantial\" and easier to handle at the moment the award is presented to the winners. According to Howard Sherman, the executive director of the American Theatre Wing:\n\nFor the specific Tony Awards presented to a Broadway production, awards are given to the author and up to two of the producers free of charge. All other members of the above-the-title producing team are eligible to purchase the physical award. Sums collected are designed to help defray the cost of the Tony Awards ceremony itself. An award cost $400 as of at least 2000, $750 as of at least 2009, and, as of 2013, had been $2,500 \"for several years\", according to Tony Award Productions.\n\n\"Source: Tony Awards Official Site, Rules\"\n\nFor the purposes of the award, a new play or musical is one that has not previously been produced on Broadway and is not \"determined… to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire\", as determined by the Administration Committee (per Section (2g) of the Rules and Regulations). The rule about \"classic\" productions was instituted by the Tony Award Administration Committee in 2002, and stated (in summary) \"A play or musical that is determined ... to be a 'classic' or in the historical or popular repertoire shall not be eligible for an Award in the Best Play or Best Musical Category but may be eligible in that appropriate Best Revival category.\" Shows transferred from Off-Broadway or the West End are eligible as \"new\", as are productions based closely on films.\n\nThis rule has been the subject of some controversy, as some shows have been ruled ineligible for the \"new\" category, meaning that their authors did not have a chance to win the important awards of Best Play or Best Musical (or Best Score or Best Book for musicals). On the other hand, some people feel that allowing plays and musicals that have been frequently produced to be eligible as \"new\" gives them an unfair advantage because they will have benefited from additional development time as well as additional familiarity with the Tony voters.\n\nThe Tony Awards Administration Committee has twenty-four members: ten designated by the American Theatre Wing, ten by The Broadway League, and one each by the Dramatists Guild, Actors' Equity Association, United Scenic Artists and the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. This committee, among other duties, determines eligibility for nominations in all awards categories.\n\nThe Tony Awards Nominating Committee makes the nominations for the various categories. This rotating group of theatre professionals is selected by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. Nominators serve three-year terms and are asked to see every new Broadway production. The Nominating Committee for the 2012-13 Broadway season (named in June 2012) had 42 members; the Nominating Committee for the 2014-2015 season has 50 members and was appointed in June 2014.\n\nThere are approximately 868 eligible Tony Award voters (as of 2014), a number that changes slightly from year to year. The number was decreased in 2009 when the first-night critics were excluded as voters. That decision was changed, and members of the New York Drama Critics' Circle were invited to be Tony voters beginning in the 2010-2011 season.\n\nThe eligible Tony voters include the board of directors and designated members of the advisory committee of the American Theatre Wing, members of the governing boards of Actors' Equity Association, the Dramatists Guild, the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers, United Scenic Artists, and the Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers, members of the Theatrical Council of the Casting Society of America and voting members of The Broadway League (in 2000, what was then The League of American Theaters and Producers changed membership eligibility and Tony voting status from a lifetime honor to all above-the-title producers, to ones who had been active in the previous 10 years. This action disenfranchised scores of Tony voters, including Gail Berman, Harve Brosten, Dick Button, Tony Lo Bianco, and Raymond Serra).\n\nTo be eligible for Tony Award consideration, a production must have officially opened on Broadway by the eligibility date that the Management Committee establishes each year. For example, the cut-off date for eligibility the 2013–2014 season was April 24, 2014. The season for Tony Award eligibility is defined in the Rules and Regulations.\n\nA Broadway theatre is defined as having 500 or more seats, among other requirements. While the rules define a Broadway theatre in terms of its size, not its geographical location, the list of Broadway theatres is determined solely by the Tony Awards Administration Committee. As of the 2016–2017 season, the list consisted solely of the 41 theaters located in the vicinity of Times Square in New York City and Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater.\n\nWhile the theatre-going public may consider the Tony Awards to be the Oscars of live theatre, critics have suggested that the Tony Awards are primarily a promotional vehicle for a small number of large production companies and theatre owners in New York City. In a 2014 \"Playbill\" article, Robert Simonson wrote that \"Who gets to perform on the Tony Awards broadcast, what they get to perform, and for how long, have long been politically charged questions in the Broadway theatre community...\" The producers \"accept the situation ... because just as much as actually winning a Tony, a performance that lands well with the viewing public can translate into big box-office sales.\" Producer Robyn Goodman noted that, if the presentation at the ceremony shows well and the show wins a Tony, \"you’re going to spike at the box office\".\n\nThe awards met further criticism when they eliminated the sound design awards in 2014. In 2014, a petition calling for the return of the Sound Design categories received more than 30,000 signatures. Addressing their previous concerns over Tony voters in the category, it was announced that upon the awards' return for the 2017-2018 season, they would be decided by a subset of voters based on their expertise.\n\nSome notable records and facts about the Tony Awards include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
