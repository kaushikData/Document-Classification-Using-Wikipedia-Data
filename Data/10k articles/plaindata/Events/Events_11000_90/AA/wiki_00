In 794 he launched a rebellion against the Abbasid Caliphate, but was defeated and killed in 795.\n\nIn several sources al-Walid is referred to as a member of the Banu Taghlib, but Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani and Ibn Khallikan call him a Shaybani, and in the opinion of Clifford Edmund Bosworth the latter identification is the correct one. He was considered a chief of the Kharijites, and reportedly acquired a reputation for audacity and bravery. During his lifetime he usually resided in the area of Nasibin and al-Khabur, in the region of the Jazira.\n\nIn 794 al-Walid revolted against the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid and quickly gathered a large number of supporters around him. He soon overran much of the Jazira and killed the governor of Diyar Rabi'a when the latter marched against him, then invaded Diyar Mudar and besieged 'Abd al-Malik ibn Salih in Raqqa. The Kharijites subsequently moved on to Arminiya and besieged Khilat, whose inhabitants agreed to ransom themselves in exchange for their liberty, and proceeded to invade Adharbayjan, Hulwan, the Sawad of Iraq and the districts on the west bank of the Tigris, enriching themselves along the way. They then returned to the Jazira, causing devastation to the province, and gained additional followers for their cause.\n\nIn an effort to stop the Kharijites, Harun al-Rashid sent two armies in succession against them, but they were defeated by the rebels and both of their commanders died in combat. The caliph then put Yazid ibn Mazyad al-Shaybani in command of a large army and dispatched him against al-Walid, urging him to bring an end to the insurgency as soon as possible. Yazid met the rebels in battle in late 795, at al-Haditha above Hit, and defeated al-Walid in single combat, killing him and cutting off his head. Yazid also killed a large number of the Kharijites and forced the remainder to disperse, and the revolt ended in defeat.\n\nAl-Walid was elegised after his death by his sister, the warrior and poet Laylā bint Ṭarīf.\n\n"}

{"id": "85033", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85033", "title": "Anna Perenna", "text": "Anna Perenna\n\nAnna Perenna was an old Roman deity of the circle or \"ring\" of the year, as the name (\"per annum\") clearly indicates. Her festival fell on the Ides of March (March 15), which would have marked the first full moon in the year in the old lunar Roman calendar when March was reckoned as the first month of the year, and was held at the grove of the goddess at the first milestone on the Via Flaminia. It was much frequented by the city \"plebs\".\n\nMacrobius records that offerings were made to her \"ut annare perannareque commode liceat\", \"i.e.\" \"that the circle of the year may be completed happily\" and that people sacrificed to her both publicly and privately. Johannes Lydus says that public sacrifice and prayers were offered to her to secure a healthy year. Ovid in his \"Fasti\" (3.523f) provides a vivid description of the revelry and licentiousness of her outdoor festival where tents were pitched or bowers built from branches, where lad lay beside lass, and people asked that Anna bestow as many more years to them as they could drink cups of wine at the festival.\n\nOvid reports a legend that identifies Anna Perenna with the sister of Dido, the Carthaginian founder in Virgil's \"Aeneid\". After Dido's tragic death, Anna finds refuge from her brother Pygmalion on Malta, with Battus, the king of the island and a wealthy host. Upon protecting Anna for three years, Battus counselled her to flee for her safety and find a fresh place of exile as her brother was seeking war. Forced again to flee over the seas, Anna Perenna was shipwrecked on the coasts of Latium where she was hosted by Aeneas' settlement of Lavinium. Anna's presence there made Lavinia increasingly jealous. Dido appeared in Anna's dream, exhorting her to abandon her latest refuge, from where she was swept away by the river Numicus and transformed into a river nymph hidden in the \"perennial stream\" (\"amnis perennis\"), and renamed Anna Perenna.\n\nOvid adds that some equate Anna Perenna with the Moon, with Themis, with Io or with Amaltheia, but prefers the report that during the \"secessio plebis\" an old woman of Bovillae named Anna baked cakes every morning and brought them to the hungry rebels, in gratitude for which the plebeians worshipped her as a goddess. Ovid goes on to report that after old Anna had become a goddess, she impersonated Minerva to gain admission to the god Mars' bedchamber, which is why coarse jokes and coarse songs are used at Anna Perenna's festivities, and remarks that since the festival of Anna Perenna is in the month dedicated to Mars, it is reasonable that Mars and Anna Perenna should be associated as cult partners.\n\nFranz Altheim, an authority on Roman religion, suggests that Anna Perenna was originally an Etruscan mother goddess, and that her relationship with Aeneas was developed to strengthen her association with Rome.\n\nTwo places of worship of Anna Perenna are attested. One in Buscemi, Sicily, where in 1899 some inscriptions to Anna and Apollo were found, and in Rome, where a fountain devoted to Anna Perenna rites was unearthed in 1999.\n\n"}
{"id": "449424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=449424", "title": "Beale ciphers", "text": "Beale ciphers\n\nThe Beale ciphers (or Beale Papers) are a set of three ciphertexts, one of which allegedly states the location of a buried treasure of gold, silver and jewels estimated to be worth over US$43 million . Comprising three ciphertexts, the first (unsolved) text describes the location, the second (solved) ciphertext the content of the treasure, and the third (unsolved) lists the names of the treasure's owners and their next of kin.\n\nThe story of the three ciphertexts originates from an 1885 pamphlet detailing treasure being buried by a man named Thomas J. Beale in a secret location in Bedford County, Virginia, in the 1820s. Beale entrusted a box containing the encrypted messages to a local innkeeper named Robert Morriss and then disappeared, never to be seen again. According to the story, the innkeeper opened the box 23 years later, and then decades after that gave the three encrypted ciphertexts to a friend before he died. The friend then spent the next twenty years of his life trying to decode the messages, and was able to solve only one of them which gave details of the treasure buried and the general location of the treasure. The unnamed friend then published all three ciphertexts in a pamphlet which was advertised for sale in the 1880s.\n\nSince the publication of the pamphlet, a number of attempts have been made to decode the two remaining ciphertexts and to locate the treasure, but all efforts have resulted in failure.\n\nThere are many arguments that the entire story is a hoax, including the 1980 article \"A Dissenting Opinion\" by cryptographer Jim Gillogly, and a 1982 scholarly analysis of the \"Beale Papers\" and their related story by Joe Nickell, using historical records that cast doubt on the existence of Thomas J. Beale. Nickell also presents linguistic evidence demonstrating that the documents could not have been written at the time alleged (words such as \"stampeding\", for instance, are of later vintage). His analysis of the writing style showed that Beale was almost certainly James B. Ward, whose 1885 pamphlet brought the Beale Papers to light. Nickell argues that the tale is thus a work of fiction; specifically, a \"secret vault\" allegory of the Freemasons; James B. Ward was a Mason himself.\n\nA single pamphlet published in 1885, entitled \"The Beale Papers\", is the only source of this story. The treasure was said to have been obtained by an American named Thomas J. Beale in the early 1800s, from a mine to the north of Nuevo México (New Mexico), at that time in the Spanish province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México (an area that today would most likely be part of Colorado). According to the pamphlet, Beale was the leader of a group of 30 gentlemen adventurers from Virginia who stumbled upon the rich mine of gold and silver while hunting buffalo. They spent 18 months mining thousands of pounds of precious metals, which they then charged Beale with transporting to Virginia and burying in a secure location. After Beale made multiple trips to stock the hiding place, he then encrypted three messages: the location, a description of the treasure, and the names of its owners and their relatives. The treasure location is traditionally linked to Montvale in Bedford County, Virginia.\n\nBeale placed the ciphertexts and some other papers in an iron box. In 1822 he entrusted the box to a Lynchburg innkeeper named Robert Morriss. Beale told Morriss not to open the box unless he or one of his men failed to return from their journey within 10 years. Sending a letter from St. Louis a few months later, Beale promised Morriss that a friend in St. Louis would mail the key to the cryptograms, however, it never arrived. It was not until 1845 that Morriss opened the box. Inside he found two plaintext letters from Beale, and several pages of ciphertext separated into Papers \"1\", \"2\", and \"3\". Morriss had no luck in solving the ciphers, and decades later left the box and its contents to an unnamed friend.\n\nThe friend, then using an edition of the United States Declaration of Independence as the key for a modified book cipher, successfully deciphered the second ciphertext which gave a description of the buried treasure. Unable to solve the other two ciphertexts, the friend ultimately made the letters and ciphertexts public in a pamphlet entitled \"The Beale Papers\", which was published by yet another friend, James B. Ward, in 1885.\n\nWard is thus not \"the friend\". Ward himself is almost untraceable in local records except that a man with that name owned the home in which a Sarah Morriss, identified as the spouse of Robert Morriss, died at age 77, in 1863. He also is recorded as becoming a Master Mason in 1863.\n\nThe plaintext of Paper #2 reads:I have deposited in the county of Bedford, about four miles from Buford's, in an excavation or vault, six feet below the surface of the ground, the following articles, belonging jointly to the parties whose names are given in number three, herewith:\n\nThe first deposit consisted of ten hundred and fourteen pounds of gold, and thirty-eight hundred and twelve pounds of silver, deposited Nov. eighteen nineteen. The second was made Dec. eighteen twenty-one, and consisted of nineteen hundred and seven pounds of gold, and twelve hundred and eighty-eight of silver; also jewels, obtained in St. Louis in exchange to save transportation, and valued at thirteen thousand dollars.\n\nThe above is securely packed in iron pots, with iron covers. The vault is roughly lined with stone, and the vessels rest on solid stone, and are covered with others. Paper number one describes the exact locality of the vault, so that no difficulty will be had in finding it.\n\nThe second cipher can be decrypted fairly easily using any copy of the United States Declaration of Independence, but some editing for spelling is necessary. To decrypt it, one finds the word corresponding to the number (\"e.g.\", the first number is 115, and the 115th word in the Declaration of Independence is \"instituted\"), and takes the first letter of that word (in the case of the example, \"I\").\n\nBeale used a version of United States Declaration of Independence different from the original. To extract the hidden message, the following 5 modifications must be applied to the original text:\n\n\nFurthermore:\n\n\nFinally, in the decoded text there are 4 errors, probably due to wrong transcription of the original paper:\n\n\nThe treasure's total weight is about 3 tons as described in inventory of the second cryptogram. This includes approximately 35,052 troy oz gold, 61,200 troy oz silver (worth about US$42 m and US$1 m, respectively, in January 2017) and jewels worth around US$220,000 in 2017. \n\nThere has been considerable debate over whether the remaining two ciphertexts are real or hoaxes. An early researcher, Carl Hammer of Sperry UNIVAC, used supercomputers of the late 1960s to analyze the ciphers and found that while the ciphers were poorly encoded, the two undeciphered ones did not show the patterns one would expect of randomly chosen numbers and probably encoded an intelligible text. Other questions remain about the authenticity of the pamphlet's account. In the words of one researcher \"To me, the pamphlet story has all the earmarks of a fake . . . [There was] no evidence save the word of the unknown author of the pamphlet that he ever had the papers.\"\n\nThe pamphlet's background story has several implausibilities, and is based almost entirely on circumstantial evidence and hearsay.\n\nThere have been many attempts to break the remaining cipher(s). Most attempts have tried other historical texts as keys (e.g., the Magna Carta, various books of the Bible, the U.S. Constitution, and the Virginia Royal Charter), assuming the ciphertexts were produced with some book cipher, but none have been recognized as successful to date. Breaking the cipher(s) may depend on random chance (as, for instance, stumbling upon a book key if the two remaining ciphertexts are actually book ciphers); so far, even the most skilled cryptanalysts who have attempted them have been defeated. Of course, Beale could have used a document that he had written himself for either or both of the remaining keys or either a document of his own or randomly selected characters for the third source, in either case rendering \"any\" further attempts to crack the codes useless.\n\nA survey of U.S. Census records in 1810 shows two persons named Thomas Beale, in Connecticut and New Hampshire. However, the population schedules from the 1810 U.S. Census are completely missing for seven states, one territory, the District of Columbia, and 18 of the counties of Virginia. The 1820 U.S. Census has two persons named Thomas Beale, Captain Thomas Beale of the battle of New Orleans 1815 in Louisiana originally from Virginia Botetourt County – Fincastle area 12 miles from Bedford County and one in Tennessee, and a Thomas K. Beale in Virginia, but the population schedules are completely missing for three states and one territory.\n\nBefore 1850 the U.S. Census recorded the names of only the heads of households; others in the household were only counted. Beale, if he existed, may have been living in someone else's household.\n\nIn addition, a man named \"Thomas Beall\" appears in the customer lists of St. Louis Post Department in 1820. According to the pamphlet, Beale sent a letter from St. Louis in 1822.\n\nAdditionally, a Cheyenne legend exists about gold and silver being taken from the West and buried in mountains in the East, dating from roughly 1820.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe has been suggested as the pamphlet's real author because he had an interest in cryptography. It was well known he placed notices of his abilities in the Philadelphia paper \"Alexander's Weekly (Express) Messenger\", inviting submissions of ciphers which he proceeded to solve. In 1843 he used a cryptogram as plot device in his short story \"The Gold-Bug\". From 1820, he was also living in Richmond, Virginia at the time of Beale's alleged encounters with Morriss. In February 1826 Poe enrolled as a student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. But with mounting debts, Poe left for Boston in April 1827. \n\nHowever, research and facts debunk Poe's authorship. He died in 1849 well before \"The Beale Papers\" were first published in 1885. The pamphlet also mentions the American Civil War that started in 1861. William Poundstone, an American author and skeptic, had stylometric analysis performed on the pamphlet for his 1983 book \"Biggest Secrets\", it found that Poe's prose is significantly different from the grammatical structure used by the author who wrote \"The Beale Papers\".\n\nDespite the Beale Papers' unproven veracity, this has not deterred treasure hunters from trying to find the vault. The \"information\" that there is buried treasure in Bedford County has stimulated many expeditions with shovels, and other implements of discovery, looking for likely spots. For more than a hundred years, people have been arrested for trespassing and unauthorized digging; some of them in groups as in the case of people from Pennsylvania in the 1990s.\n\nSeveral digs were completed at the top of Porter's Mountain, one in late 1980s with the land owner's permission as long as any treasure found was split 50/50. However, the treasure hunters only found Civil War artifacts. As the value of these artifacts paid for time and equipment rental, the expedition broke even.\n\nThe story has been the subject of multiple television documentaries, such as the UK's \"Mysteries\" series, a segment in the third episode of \"Unsolved Mysteries\"; and the 2011 \"Declaration of Independence\" episode of the History Channel TV show \"Brad Meltzer's Decoded\". There are also several books, and considerable Internet activity. In 2014, the National Geographic TV show \"The Numbers Game\" referred to the Beale ciphers as one of the strongest passwords ever created. In 2015 the UKTV series \"Myth Hunters\" (also known as \"Raiders of the Lost Past\") devoted one of its season 3 episodes to the topic. Also in 2015, the Josh Gates series \"Expedition Unknown\" visited Bedford to investigate the Beale Ciphers and search for the treasure.\n\nSimon Singh's 1999 book \"The Code Book\" explains the Beale cipher mystery in one of its chapters.\n\nIn 2010, an award-winning animated short film was made concerning the ciphers called \"The Thomas Beale Cipher\".\n\n\n\n"}

They discuss the idea of nuclear power and its control, the rationale behind building or not building an atomic bomb, the uncertainty of the past and the inevitability of the future as embodiments of themselves acting as particles drifting through the atom that is Copenhagen.\n\nIn most dramatic works where the characters are based on real people, there is a point at which the character deviates from the real person. Michael Frayn works to keep this distinction as small as possible. Having studied memoirs and letters and other historical records of the two physicists, Frayn feels confident in claiming that \"The actual words spoken by [the] characters are entirely their own.\" With that in mind, the character descriptions apply to both the representative characters as well as the physicists themselves. There is a great amount known about all of the primary characters presented in \"Copenhagen\"; the following includes those bits of information which are directly relevant and referenced in the work itself.\n\n\n\"Copenhagen\" cannot be labelled simply as a comedy or tragedy; the lack of a protagonist and direct conflict prevents this in large part. David Rush explores a subgenre of theatre, a later hybrid form known as \"drama,\" which he describes as a piece which cannot be specifically categorised as a tragedy, but which he notes involves \"serious people going about serious business in a serious way.\" As the characters in \"Copenhagen\" are already dead, they cannot suffer any tragic fall; though there is definite wit in the arguments, it is taken in a very serious light seeing as it regards subjects like war, fear and nuclear arms. It is most nearly a \"drama,\" but works in many ways as an expository piece in the manner it presents information to the audience.\n\nThe construction of the plot is non-linear, seeing as it does not exist in time and space. Sometimes one character will not notice that there are other people in the space, and speak as if to no one. The world that Frayn presents is outside of our conceptions as audience members, simply by virtue of the fact that no one attending the play has ever died. So the world in which \"Copenhagen\" is based is somewhere between heaven and an atom.\n\nIt can also be thought to exist \"inside the heads\" of the characters present. It is a subjective world, taking and manipulating history, picking apart some events and mashing others together to better compare them. The characters are all plagued by some form of guilt or another, particularly in reference to the atomic bomb, and they are trapped in this world, doomed to forever speculate on that evening in Copenhagen in 1941 to determine how the world might have been changed. These are all traits of the artistic style known as Expressionism.\n\nIn his preface to \"A Dream Play\", August Strindberg notes that in these worlds, \"everything is possible and probable. Time and space do not exist. Working with... real events as a background, the imagination spins out its threads of thoughts and weaves them into new patterns.\" \"Copenhagen\" is an embodiment of these principles.\n\nBecause the concepts in physics and politics are at times very complicated or very abstract, Frayn uses several controlling images to better relate certain ideas to his audience.\n\n• \"Skiing\" and \"Table-Tennis\" – These two activities are referred to as a pastime of Bohr and Heisenberg's, and both demonstrate the competition between the two (representative of national competition.) They are also used to suggest Heisenberg's speed and recklessness which contrasts with Bohr's caution and tediousness.\n\n• \"Invisible Straight\" – An anecdote in which Bohr managed to bluff himself in a game of poker by betting on a straight that he thought he had, but he really did not. This principle is applied to nuclear weaponry, suggesting that nations will act differently when they think that an opponent can produce nuclear arms, whether or not the opponent can.\n\n• \"Cap-Pistols, Land Mines and Nuclear Reactors\" – These fall into the Toy vs. Weapon theme and once again presents anecdotes of Bohr and Heisenberg's lives. Their fascination in playing with the new toy blinds them to the danger that it poses.\n\n• \"Bomb\" – The term \"bomb\" appears as a literal looming image in many cases, but it is used figuratively in a couple of instances, as if it should be a joke, but with such grave implications that it cannot be found funny. (For example, Heisenberg refers to a \"bomb having gone off\" in Bohr's head.)\n\n• \"Christian Reaching for the Life-Buoy\" – Christian was one of Bohr's sons, who tragically drowned while he and Bohr were out sailing. The phrase \"Christian reaches for the life-buoy\" appears several times during the play, and every time, the characters seem to hold their breath in the hope that this time, Christian will survive. Bohr had concluded that they would have both drowned had he jumped in to save his son, and this presents an idea of futile heroics, particularly with reference to Heisenberg and what should happen if he were to resist Hitler's rule.\n\n• \"Another Draft\" – Whenever the characters conclude that an interpretation of their 1941 meeting is incorrect, they call for \"another draft.\"\n\nThough the dialogue does not contradict logic, it cannot be called realistic in the strictest sense. One character's line might fade into the next, as though the second person knew exactly what he was going to say; sometimes a character will slip into a memory and partially relive a former or younger self in a monologue; and over the course of the show, there is a definite ambiguity as to whether they are speaking to one another or to the audience.\n\nThe play was originally written in English, but the real people in the exchange may have had this conversation in Danish or German. But even with translation in mind, Frayn defends that the words in the script are those that the characters would actually say. In his post-script, he writes, \"If this needs any justification, I can only appeal to Heisenberg himself.\" Understandably, Frayn needs to present the characters in an interesting and dramatic light, as well as depicting a setting that no living person has visited, so the accuracy of such dialogue is subject to dwindle by degrees.\n\n\"Plain language\" and \"scientific language\" both operate in this play. There are several instances when the two physicists start speaking too scientifically for many people to understand, and one of them will remark that they must revert to plain language, to explain it in a way that Margrethe will understand. Even for this effort though, criticism arose about the complexity of the play and the difficulty for viewers to comprehend. A writer for \"The Commonweal\" commented on the Broadway premiere, saying that \"the play's relentless cerebral forays can... be frustrating.\"\n\nLondon Premiere – 1998\n\n\"Copenhagen\" opened in the National Theatre in London and ran for more than 300 performances, starring David Burke as Niels Bohr, Sara Kestelman as Margrethe Bohr, and Matthew Marsh as Werner Heisenberg. It was directed by Michael Blakemore.\n\n\"Copenhagen\" transferred to the Duchess Theatre in London's West End, where it ran from 8 February 1999, for more than 750 performances. It had a \"second\" cast when it opened in the West End, who were responsible for performing at least one of the matinee shows each week. The second cast consisted of David Baron as Niels Bohr, Corinna Marlowe as Margarethe Bohr, and William Brand as Werner Heisenberg, and after six months, they replaced the original cast for the rest of the West End run.\n\nBroadway Opening – April 2000\n\nContinuing under the direction of Michael Blakemore, it opened on Broadway at the Royale Theatre on 11 April and ran for 326 performances. Starring Philip Bosco as Bohr, Michael Cumpsty as Heisenberg and Blair Brown as Margrethe, it went on to win the Tony Award for Best Play, along with two others for Best Featured Actress in a Play (Blair Brown), and Best Direction of a Play (Michael Blakemore). But even for its success, Frayn admitted in an article that \"A number of commentators expressed misgivings about the whole enterprise.\" Several critics noted that it was heavy with scientific dialogue, a little too heavy for the common audience. Though a writer from \"Physics World\" hailed it as \"brilliant theatre ,\" a Charles Spencer, of the \"Daily Telegraph\", wrote, \"I felt that my brain was being stretched to breaking point—well beyond breaking point, in fact.\"\n\nTV Movie – 2002\n\nThe play was adapted as a television movie in 2002, with Daniel Craig as Heisenberg, Stephen Rea as Niels Bohr, and Francesca Annis as Margrethe Bohr. The movie substantially cuts down the script of the play, eliminating several recurring themes, and most of the material that established the community of scientists in Copenhagen. It also abandons the abstract staging of the theatrical version in favour of being set in the city of Copenhagen, in Bohr's old house.\n\nRecent revivals\n\nThe play has had many productions and revivals, including:\n\nRadio – January 2013\n\nAdapted and directed by Emma Harding for BBC Radio 3 starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Werner Heisenberg, Greta Scacchi as Margrethe Bohr and Simon Russell Beale as Niels Bohr.\n\n\n\nThe meeting took place in September 1941 when Bohr and Heisenberg were 55 and 39, respectively. Heisenberg had worked with Bohr in Copenhagen for several years starting in 1924.\n\nHeisenberg historians remain divided over their own interpretations of the event. Frayn's 1998 play brought more attention to what previously had been a primarily scholarly discussion. A collection of historical essays provoked by the play was published in English in 2005.\n\nMuch of the initial controversy stemmed from a 1956 letter Heisenberg sent to the journalist Robert Jungk after reading the German edition of Jungk's book, \"Brighter than a Thousand Suns\" (1956). In the letter, Heisenberg described how he had come to Copenhagen to discuss with Bohr his moral objections toward scientists working on nuclear weapons, but how he had failed to say this clearly before the conversation came to a halt. Jungk published an extract from the letter in the Danish edition of the book in 1956 which, out of context, made it look as if Heisenberg was claiming to have sabotaged the German bomb project on moral grounds. (The letter's whole text shows Heisenberg was careful not to claim this.) Bohr was outraged after reading this extract in his copy of the book, feeling that this was false and that the 1941 meeting had proven to him that Heisenberg was quite happy to produce nuclear weapons for Germany.\n\nAfter the play inspired numerous scholarly and media debates over the 1941 meeting, the Niels Bohr Archive in Copenhagen released to the public all sealed documents related to the meeting, a move intended mostly to settle historical arguments over what they contained.\nAmong the documents were the unsent letters Bohr drafted to Heisenberg in 1957 about Jungk's book and other topics.\n\nThese drafts proved to be significant in several respects. First, they proved to be relatively consistent with Heisenberg's recollections of the meeting given to Jungk in 1956, meaning that the course of the conversation can now be fairly well established. Bohr and Heisenberg agree that Heisenberg started the visit by stating to Bohr that nuclear weapons were now conceivable. As Heisenberg wrote to Jungk,\nThis talk probably started with my question as to whether or not it was right for physicists to devote themselves in wartime to the uranium problem – as there was the possibility that progress in this sphere could lead to grave consequences in the technique of the war.\nBohr confirms this by writing\nIt had to make a very strong impression on me that at the very outset you stated that you felt certain that the war, if it lasted sufficiently long, would be decided with atomic weapons.\n\nHeisenberg repeated his convictions on the technical feasibility of building nuclear weapons. As Heisenberg recalled: He [Bohr] replied as far as I can remember with a counter-question, \"Do you really think that uranium fission could be utilized for the construction of weapons?\" I may have replied: \"I know that this is in principle possible, but it would require a terrific technical effort, which, one can only hope, cannot be realized in this war.\" Bohr was shocked by my reply. Bohr's draft letters are consistent with this: \nI did not respond to this at all, but as you perhaps regarded this as an expression of doubt, you related how in the preceding years you had devoted yourself almost exclusively to the question and were quite certain that it could be done... \n(This point is of interest, because it is at odds with the suggestion by critics that miscalculations by Heisenberg had led him to conclude erroneously, that atomic weapons were not feasible. According to Bohr's later notes, Heisenberg then told Bohr that he had not come to discuss the technical aspects of the potential weapons:\nHeisenberg said explicitly that he did not wish to enter into technical details but that Bohr should understand that he knew what he was talking about as he had spent 2 years working exclusively on this question.\n\nUnfortunately, because of Heisenberg's concerns about being monitored – his discussion of any details of Germany's nuclear efforts with someone in an occupied country would have been illegal – his remarks were cryptic. Indeed, Bohr's letters note that Heisenberg spoke \"in vague terms\", from which Bohr was only able to form an \"impression\" about Heisenberg's efforts.\nBohr wrote of this:\n\nI listened to this without speaking since [a] great matter for mankind was at issue in which, despite our personal friendship, we had to be regarded as representatives of two sides engaged in mortal combat. That my silence and gravity, as you write in the letter, could be taken as an expression of shock at your reports that it was possible to make an atomic bomb is a quite peculiar misunderstanding, which must be due to the great tension in your own mind. From the day three years earlier when I realized that slow neutrons could only cause fission in Uranium 235 and not 238, it was of course obvious to me that a bomb with certain effect could be produced by separating the uraniums. In June 1939 I had even given a public lecture in Birmingham about uranium fission, where I talked about the effects of such a bomb but of course added that the technical preparations would be so large that one did not know how soon they could be overcome. If anything in my behaviour could be interpreted as shock, it did not derive from such reports but rather from the news, as I had to understand it, that Germany was participating vigorously in a race to be the first with atomic weapons.\n\nThis circumspect discussion, combined with Bohr's shocked reaction to it, apparently cut off the discussion between the two. Thus, the Bohr letters cannot resolve the question, posed by the Copenhagen play, of what Heisenberg had tried to convey to Bohr.\n\nHeisenberg's comment that he knew about the potential for weaponizing uranium fission, appears to counter the arguments of critics such as Rose and Bernstein that calculation errors in 1940 about feasibility, rather than moral scruples, led Heisenberg not to pursue building nuclear weapons.\n\nFinally, the 1957 Bohr draft letters, written 16 years after the meeting, suggest a conflict between Bohr and Heisenberg. Heisenberg's letter to his wife, written on the eve of his departure from Copenhagen, provides no hint of a fracture. In it, he related his final evening with Bohr as very pleasant and unremarkable: \"Today I was once more, with Weizsäcker, at Bohr's. In many ways this was especially nice, the conversation revolved for a large part of the evening around purely human concerns, Bohr was reading aloud, I played a Mozart Sonata (a-Major).\"\n\nIn a March 2006 interview Ivan Supek, one of Heisenberg's students and friends, commented that \"\"Copenhagen\" is a bad play\" and that \"Frayn mixed up some things\". Supek also claimed that Weizsäcker was the main figure of the meeting. Allegedly, \"Heisenberg and Weizsäcker came to Bohr wearing German army uniforms. Weizsäcker tried to persuade Bohr to mediate for peace between Great Britain and Germany and Heisenberg practically completely relied on his political judgement\". Supek received these details in a confidential conversation with Margrethe who thought he would never make them public. Supek however felt it was \"his duty to announce these facts so that future generations can know the truth about the Bohr – Heisenberg meeting\".\n\nSupek's statements about Bohr's recollection of \"the Bohr – Heisenberg meeting\" mixes up the visit. Because Heisenberg could only visit Bohr in occupied Denmark on behalf of the German government, Heisenberg was obliged to make public lectures on behalf of the Government which were monitored by German government officials. Heisenberg tried to convey his opinions later during private discussions with Bohr. Heisenberg's letters to his wife and later to Jungk place his conversation with Bohr on Wednesday evening. Either he talked with Bohr on a walk, or at his residence. [3][7] Bohr, Supek, and Heisenberg describe the meeting differently\n\nOver the course of the play, a number of renowned physicists are mentioned. Many of them are referenced in the context of their work with either Bohr or Heisenberg. This is the order they appear in the script:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"flypast\" is used in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. In the United States, the terms flyover and flyby are used.\n\nFlypasts are often tied in with Royal or state events, anniversaries, celebrations - and occasionally funerary or memorial occasions. Sometimes flypasts occur in special situations, to honour someone or to celebrate certain types of aircraft. They have affinities with parades, of which they form the aerial component. Often they occur in purely display contexts at airshows, but it is the flypasts linked with civic, ceremonial and national pride, that imprint themselves on a nation's memory. Some flypasts have been described in broadcast and print media as \"historic\".\n\nFlypasts are regularly featured in public and ceremonial life in the United Kingdom, where they function as a particular kind of aerial salute. They serve to show respect, display aircraft, showcase flying skills and as a form of entertainment to delight the public, for example, during their annual appearance after Trooping the Colour. Flypasts reflect milestones of national life; varying in scope from personal, to community and local, to military, to national. They may honour individuals in private or public life or commemorate happenings at a particular location. They are also used to honour aircraft. On occasions both small and large they may occur over land or sea, sometimes connected with memorial or thanksgiving services.\n\nIn Commonwealth countries, notably Singapore, Canada and Australia, they occur on national days and occasionally on anniversaries. They are seen more rarely in other territories.\n\nFlypast locations are usually of national importance. In the UK, these include Buckingham Palace, where the Royal Family on the balcony will join the thousands of spectators in streets and parks below. Other London settings have included the River Thames. The 50th and 60th anniversaries of World War II were celebrated by flypasts over Normandy in France. Festivities of Trafalgar 200 were centred over Portsmouth and at sea.\n\nSettings have included the National Stadium, The Float@Marina Bay and the Padang in Singapore; Rajpath in New Delhi, India; Pakistan's Parliament House in Islamabad; Australia's Parliament House and Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial, in Canberra; Parliament Hill, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada; and Rizal Park in Manila, Philippines.\n\nThe connection of Trooping the Colour with Royal Air Force flypasts began in 1913 when the Royal Flying Corps Military Wing performed a flypast for King George V on Laffan's Plain, near Aldershot.\n\nOn 6 July 1935, George V carried out his Silver Jubilee Review of the Royal Air Force at RAF Duxford and RAF Mildenhall which included 200 aircraft on the ground and a flypast of 350 aircraft.\n\nKing George VI attended a flypast at the opening ceremony of the Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938 at Ibrox Stadium on 5 May 1938, with his consort Queen Elizabeth.\n\nFlypasts are a regular occurrence in the United Kingdom at national events or commemorations. In 1954 the Queen conducted a Coronation Review of the Royal Air Force at RAF Odiham which included a flypast by about 640 aircraft - among them 440 jet aircraft.\n\nOn many occasions, the flypasts are performed by the Red Arrows aerobatic team of the Royal Air Force, but on more important events like Royal occasions, for example the Queen's 80th birthday during 2006, was a flypast following the Trooping the Colour. Headed by the Lancaster with 2 Hurricanes and 2 Spitfires (Battle of Britain Memorial Flight), the 49 aircraft in 9 formations included Typhoons, Jaguars, Tristar, VC10, C-17A Globemaster III and E-3 Sentry. The highlight was a \"Diamond 9\" formation of Tornado GR4s and the appearance of a Canberra escorted by the Red Arrows.\n\nHistoric aircraft of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, including Supermarine Spitfires and the Avro Lancaster perform flypasts throughout the year particularly on military anniversaries and occasions and as a mark of respect at funerals and memorial services.\n\nIn many countries, flypasts, normally performed by the precision aerobatic team of a country's air force, are an integral part of Republic Day or National Day celebrations.\n\nOn Canada Day 1 July, the Snowbirds of the Royal Canadian Air Force perform a flyby over Parliament Hill in Ottawa. In 2017, this flypast was extended to 39 aircraft to mark Canada's 150th birthday.\n\nThe Pakistan Air Force conducts a flypast every year on 23 March to commemorate the Lahore Declaration and the Republic Day of Pakistan which occurred on 23 March 1956. This is done in Islamabad.\n\nIn Singapore the National Day Parade on 9 August 2005 celebrated 40 years of independence with an elaborate flypast \nincluding two Chinook helicopters flying the national flag past the Esplanade Theatre in Padang.\n\nIn Finland, during Independence Day parade on 6 December the Finnish Air Force has traditionally performed a flyover of four fighters at the moment when the honour company of the Air force passes the podium where a representative of the war veterans, a representative of the city and the commander of the military province in question receive the parade troops marching past, the Helicopter battalion of Utti Jaeger Regiment has also performed flyovers timed to happen at the same time when the honour company of the Finnish Army provided by the Utti Jaeger Regiment passes the podium.\n\nIn India, Republic Day celebrations on 26 January includes a flypast in Delhi.\n\nIn the Philippines, flypasts (also called flybys) by Philippine Air Force are held to celebrate Independence Day on 12 June and Rizal Day on 30 December.\n\nOn 1 April 2008, a flypast by the Red Arrows over Central London marked the 90th Anniversary of the founding of the Royal Air Force. The milestone was also celebrated that June following Trooping the Colour 2008 with a flypast of 55 aircraft, and in July with a Royal Review and flypast of 90 aircraft at the Royal International Air Tattoo. \n\nTen years later, the RAF's centenary was celebrated over The Mall, London and Buckingham Palace on 10 July 2018 with a large-scale flypast featuring the Red Arrows, the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, and aircraft from several RAF squadrons. This flypast featured 103 aircraft of 24 different types, spread out over twenty different formations. The entire flypast took nine minutes to pass over London. This was also the RAF's longest ever flypast: line of aircraft stretching over 100 miles long and featuring aircraft based from 17 different airfields all over the United Kingdom.\n\nDuring October 2006, the Indian Air Force celebrated its Platinum Jubilee with a flypast of around 78 aircraft, including the Sukhoi 30 MKI, the Mirage 2000, and MiG-25 attack aircraft.\nAnniversaries of World War II, such as VJ Day, have also been celebrated with flypasts in other countries, notably Australia and Canada and over the Normandy beaches.\n\nAchievements of the Royal Air Force in World War II were celebrated at the time and continue to be commemorated in flypasts. The upper dams of Ladybower Reservoir were used to practise for the Dambusters raids and this is occasionally commemorated in flypasts by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.\n\nOn 15 September 1945, after the war ended, about 300 aircraft flew over London in the first Battle of Britain anniversary flypast. \"The formation was led by 247 Squadron in their new Vampire fighters, the first time the public had seen the aircraft.\" This flypast was apparently led by Douglas Bader (RAF hero commemorated and portrayed by Kenneth More in the film \"Reach For the Sky.\")\n\nAn attender recalls a victory parade in London on 8 June 1946 featuring two flypasts, one during the day and one at night. Scores of aircraft, of many kinds, took part.\n\nThe 50th and 60th anniversaries of World War II were commemorated with large flypasts. On 15 September 1990, 168 aircraft in seven formations celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Further flypasts occurred on 6 June 1994, celebrating the 50th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nOver the weekend of 19–20 August 1995, the 50th anniversary of VJ Day was marked in London, including \"a two-minute silence which...was ended by an Avro Lancaster bomber overflying The Mall and dropping about a million poppies over the site.\" In the evening, there was a further flypast on the Thames.\n\n6 June 2004 marked the 60th Anniversary of D-day, with the Normandy landings commemorated by veterans (many now aged 80+ years) and political leaders at locations throughout Normandy. The Battle of Britain Memorial Flight scattered millions of poppies over the veterans as they crossed the English Channel by ferry. Later, it flew over the veterans at Arromanches, concluding a memorial service with a 47-aircraft flypast of modern military jets led by the RAF Red Arrows. At Pegasus Bridge, the Army Air Corps conducted a flypast of Lynx helicopters.\n\nOn 10 July 2005, the 60th anniversary of VE Day was marked by a flypast of vintage aircraft which again dropped one million poppies on crowds in The Mall.\n\nThe 60th anniversary in 2003 of the Dambusters raid was marked by a flypast of the last operational Lancaster over the cliffs at Reculver, site of secret tests of inventor Barnes Wallis's bouncing bomb. (This flight was part of a larger series of flypasts over key locations by the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.)\n\nOn 16 May 2008, Les Munro, the last surviving Squadron Leader, and Richard Todd, star of the celebrated film \"The Dambusters\", attended the 65th Anniversary service and flypast over Ladybower Reservoir. At 100 feet, as compared to 60 feet of the Dambusters' practice runs, a single Lancaster aircraft passed three times over Derwent Water. A Spitfire, two Tornadoes, and a Dakota transport plane also participated.\n\nIn 2003, the Royal Australian Air Force commemorated Anzac Day with a flypast of four aircraft - Harvard and Winjeel - over the Cenotaph in Ballarat, Victoria.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Air Force at the Canada Aviation Museum in Ottawa honoured Canada's participation and commemorated the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on 17 September 2006. Modern aircraft performed a flypast along with four World War II planes provided by Vintage Wings of Canada who made a \"once-in-a-lifetime formation\".\n\nTo mark the 70th Anniversary of VE Day, a flypast of 56 historical aircraft was performed over the National Mall in Washington, D.C. on May 8th, 2015. This flypast was a rare sight for residents, as it was the first time in several years that the restricted airspace over Washington was opened for the occasion.\n\nThe largest flypast in history occurred on the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender which formally ended the war between Japan and the allied powers in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. 400 B-29 bombers and 3000 carrier aircraft participated.\n\nOn 7 May 2007, hundreds of workers at Kennedy Space Center watched as US Air Force Thunderbirds performed a series of passes over the main industrial area, where the Space Shuttle is maintained and prepared for launches. The purpose of this demonstration was to photograph the planes at KSC for promotional purposes. Almost six months later, in November 2007, the Kennedy Space Center hosted the inaugural World Space Expo.

This would make the Geminids, together with the Quadrantids, the only major meteor showers not originating from a comet. The meteors from this shower are slow moving, can be seen in December and usually peak around December 13–14, with the date of highest intensity being the morning of December 14. The shower is thought to be intensifying every year and recent showers have seen 120–160 meteors per hour under optimal conditions, generally around 02:00 to 03:00 local time. Geminids were first observed in 1862, much more recently than other showers such as the Perseids (36 AD) and Leonids (902 AD).\n\nThe meteors in this shower appear to come from a radiant in the constellation Gemini (hence the shower's name). However, they can appear almost anywhere in the night sky, and often appear yellowish in hue. Well north of the equator, the radiant rises about sunset, reaching a usable elevation from the local evening hours onwards. In the southern hemisphere, the radiant appears only around local midnight or so. Observers in the northern hemisphere will see higher Geminid rates as the radiant is higher in the sky. The meteors travel at medium speed in relation to other showers, at about , making them fairly easy to spot. The Geminids are now considered by many to be the most consistent and active annual shower. Geminids disintegrate while at heights above .\n\n\n"}

The first production was planned to take place on 26 December 1637, but was postponed until 3 January 1638. The piece was then performed annually (on New Year's Day) in Amsterdam until 1968.\n\nSet in 1304, it tells the story of the siege of Amsterdam and its surrounding towns, united by the Kennemers and Waterlanders. The reason for the siege is Gijsbrecht's alleged involvement in the abduction and manslaughter of Floris V in 1296.\n\nThe enemy soldiers appear to leave but smuggle themselves into the town, hidden in a cargo of firewood being shipped in by the citizens of Amsterdam. After a violent battle, Gijsbrecht is forced to flee to Prussia, to found a \"New Holland\" there.\n\nIn reality, the nobleman who in 1304 invaded Amsterdam (to recover his position and possessions lost in 1296) was not Gijsbrecht IV (1235–1303), but his son Jan I (1270–1345).\n\nHistorian Pim de Boer at the University of Groningen has found serious (though not entirely conclusive) indications that Gijsbrecht - after his exile, with a few followers - founded Pruissisch Holland (now in Poland), not far from Elbing (also now in Poland).\nVarious parodies and continuations of the play have been produced by other authors, including the musical \"The Angel of Amsterdam\" (\"De Engel van Amsterdam\").\n\n"}

{"id": "7949372", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7949372", "title": "Humanitarian principles", "text": "Humanitarian principles\n\nThere are a number of meanings for the term humanitarian. Here humanitarian pertains to the practice of saving lives and alleviating suffering. It is usually related to emergency response (also called humanitarian response) whether in the case of a natural disaster or a man-made disaster such as war or other armed conflict. Humanitarian principles govern the way humanitarian response is carried out.\n\nThe principle of humanity means that all humankind shall be treated humanely and equally in all circumstances by saving lives and alleviating suffering, while ensuring respect for the individual. It is the fundamental principle of humanitarian response.\n\nThe Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief (RC/NGO Code) introduces the concept of the humanitarian imperative which expands the principle of humanity to include the right to receive and to give humanitarian assistance. It states the obligation of the international community \"to provide humanitarian assistance wherever it is needed.\"\n\nProvision of humanitarian assistance must be impartial and not based on nationality, race, religion, or political point of view. It must be based on need alone.\n\nFor most non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs), the principle of impartiality is unambiguous even if it is sometimes difficult to apply, especially in rapidly changing situations. However, it is no longer clear which organizations can claim to be humanitarian. For example, companies like PADCO, a USAID subcontractor, is sometimes seen as a humanitarian NGO. However, for the UN agencies, particularly where the UN is involved in peace keeping activities as the result of a Security Council resolution, it is not clear if the UN is in position to act in an impartial manner if one of the parties is in violation of terms of the UN Charter.\n\nHumanitarian agencies must formulate and implement their own policies independently of government policies or actions.\n\nProblems may arise because most NGHAs rely in varying degrees on government donors. Thus for some organizations it is difficult to maintain independence from their donors and not be confused in the field with governments who may be involved in the hostilities. The ICRC, has set the example for maintaining its independence (and neutrality) by raising its funds from governments through the use of separate annual appeals for headquarters costs and field operations.\n\nThe core principles are defining characteristics, the necessary conditions for humanitarian response. Organizations such as military forces and for-profit companies may deliver assistance to communities affected by disaster in order to save lives and alleviate suffering, but they are not considered by the humanitarian sector as humanitarian agencies as their response is not based on the core principles.\n\nIn addition to the core principles, there are other principles that govern humanitarian response for specific types of humanitarian agencies such as UN agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and NGOs.\n\nThe International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement follows, in addition to the above core principles, the principle of neutrality. For the Red Cross, neutrality means not to take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.\n\nThe principle of neutrality was specifically addressed to the Red Cross Movement to prevent it from not only taking sides in a conflict, but not to \"engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.\" The principle of neutrality was left out of the Red Cross/NGO code because some of the NGHAs, while committed to giving impartial assistance, were not ready to forgo their lobbying on justice issues related to political and ideological questions.\n\nUnited Nations General Assembly Resolution 46/182 lists the principle of neutrality, alongside the principles of humanity and impartiality in its annex as a guide to the provision of humanitarian assistance. The resolution is designed to strengthen human response of the UN system, and it clearly applies to the UN agencies.\n\nNeutrality can also apply to humanitarian actions of a state. \"Neutrality remains closely linked with the definition which introduced the concept into international law to designate the status of a State which decided to stand apart from an armed conflict. Consequently, its applications under positive law still depend on the criteria of abstention and impartiality which have characterized neutrality from the outset.\"\n\nThe application of the word neutrality to humanitarian aid delivered by UN agencies or even governments can be confusing. GA Resolution 46/182 proclaims the principle of neutrality, yet as an inter-governmental political organization, the UN is often engaged in controversies of a political nature. According to this interpretation, the UN agency or a government can provide neutral humanitarian aid as long as it does it impartially, based upon need alone.\n\nToday, the word neutrality is widely used within the humanitarian community, usually to mean the provision of humanitarian aid in an impartial and independent manner, based on need alone. Few international NGOs have curtailed work on justice or human rights issues because of their commitment to neutrality.\n\nThe provision of aid must not exploit the vulnerability of victims and be used to further political or religious creeds. All of the major non-governmental humanitarian agencies (NGHAs) by signing up to the RC/NGO Code of Conduct have committed themselves not to use humanitarian response to further political or religious creeds.\n\nAll of the above principles are important requirements for effective field operations. They are based on widespread field experience of agencies engaged in humanitarian response. In conflict situations, their breach may drastically affect the ability of agencies to respond to the needs of the victims.\n\nIf a warring party believes, for example, that an agency is favoring the other side, or that it is an agent of the enemy, access to the victims may be blocked and the lives of humanitarian workers may be put in danger. If one of the parties perceives that an agency is trying to spread another religious faith, there may be a hostile reaction to their activities.\n\nThe core principles, found in the Red Cross/NGO Code of Conduct and in GA Resolution 46/182 are derived from the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, particularly principles I (humanity), II (impartiality), III (neutrality—in the case of the UN), and IV (independence).\n\nAccountability has been defined as: \"the processes through which an organisation makes a \ncommitment to respond to and balance the needs of stakeholders in its decision making processes and activities, and delivers against this commitment.\" Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International adds: \"Accountability is about using power responsibly.\"\n\nArticle 9 of the Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief states:\n\"We hold ourselves accountable to both those we seek to assist and those from whom we accept resources;\" and thus identifies the two major stake holders: donors and beneficiaries. However, traditionally humanitarian agencies have tended to practice mainly \"upward accountability\", i.e. to their donors.\n\nThe experience of many humanitarian agencies during the Rwandan Genocide, led to a number of initiatives designed to improve humanitarian assistance and accountability, particularly with respect to the beneficiaries. Examples include the Sphere Project, ALNAP, Compas, the People In Aid Code of Good Practice, and the Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International, which runs a \"global quality insurance scheme for humanitarian agencies.\"\n\nThe RC/NGO Code also lists a number of more aspirational principles which are derived from experience with development assistance.\n\nThe Sphere Project Humanitarian Charter uses the language of human rights to remind that the right to life which is proclaimed in both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights is related to human dignity.\n\nHumanitarian principles are mainly focused on the behavior of organizations. However a humane response implies that humanitarian workers are not to take advantage of the vulnerabilities of those affected by war and violence. Agencies have the responsibility for developing rules of staff conduct which prevent abuse of the beneficiaries.\n\nOne of the most problematic areas is related to the issue of sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries by humanitarian workers. In an emergency where victims have lost everything, women and girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse.\n\nA number of reports which identified the sexual exploitation of refugees in west Africa prodded the humanitarian community to work together in examining the problem and to take measures to prevent abuses. In July 2002, the UN's Interagency Standing Committee (IASC) adopted a plan of action which stated: Sexual exploitation and abuse by humanitarian workers constitute acts of gross misconduct and are therefore grounds for termination of employment. The plan explicitly prohibited the \"Exchange of money, employment, goods, or services for sex, including sexual favours or other forms of humiliating, degrading or exploitative behaviour.\" The major NGHAs as well the UN agencies engaged in humanitarian response committed themselves to setting up internal structures to prevent sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries.\n\nSubstantial efforts have been made in the humanitarian sector to monitor compliance with humanitarian principles. Such efforts include The People In Aid Code of Good Practice, an internationally recognised management tool that helps humanitarian and development organisations enhance the quality of their human resources management. The NGO, Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International, is also working to make humanitarian organizations more accountable, especially to the beneficiaries.\n\nStructures internal to the Red Cross Movement monitor compliance to the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross.\n\nThe RC/NGO Code is self-enforcing. The SCHR carries out peer reviews among its members which look in part at the issue of compliance with principles set out in the RC/NGO Code\n\n"}

The observer ace claimed to have survived a bizarre flying mishap which earned him the moniker \"The Luckiest Man Alive.\" Hedley also survived uninjured after his plane was shot down in 1918, and he became a prisoner of war. After his immigration to the United States in 1920, he became a regular on the lecture circuit, enthralling American audiences with the stories of his military service.\n\nJohn Herbert Hedley, son of Ralph Hedley and his wife Ann Dunn Hair Hedley, was born on 19 July 1887 in North Shields, Northumberland, England. He was the oldest of three surviving sons. In 1891 and 1901, John, his parents, and two brothers continued to live in North Shields. His father was employed as a shipyard timekeeper, and his mother worked as a general shopkeeper. However, Ralph Hedley (1863–1901) died at age 38, shortly after the 1901 census, his death registered at Tynemouth, Northumberland in the second quarter of the year. At the time of the 1911 census, John Hedley was employed as an accountant's clerk and resided with his widowed mother and two younger brothers in North Shields. His mother, Ann Dunn Hair Hedley (1859–1912), died the following year at age 52. In the last quarter of 1912, John's marriage to Isabella C Sands was registered in Tynemouth, Northumberland. His son John Herbert Hedley, Jr. was born in 1914 in North Shields, the birth also registered in Tynemouth.\n\nThere is some disagreement among a variety of sources with regard to the details of John Hedley's military career. Hedley indicated that he joined the British Army on 4 August 1914. His medal index card indicates that he was with the Northumberland Fusiliers. This is supported by the \"London Gazette\" which reported that Hedley received a promotion from temporary Second Lieutenant to temporary Captain in the 26th Battalion (3rd Tyneside Irish) of the Northumberland Fusiliers on 1 May 1915. On 27 July 1915, he was appointed temporary Captain in the Army Cyclist Corps, from the 26th (Service) Battalion (3rd Tyneside Irish) of the Northumberland Fusiliers. The Gazette further indicated that he returned to the Northumberland Fusiliers as temporary Captain on 10 November 1915. According to author Norman Franks, John Herbert Hedley served with the Lincolnshire Regiment (17th Labour Company) before transfer to the Royal Flying Corps General List and was not promoted to temporary Captain until 13 April 1917. This is partially supported by the Gazette, which announced that temporary Captain J. H. Hedley of the Lincolnshire Regiment was appointed temporary captain in the Labour Corps, retaining present seniority, effective 13 April 1917. Further, Franks indicates that in October 1917, Hedley was with the No. 62 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps in England and the following month, on 6 November 1917, he joined No. 20 Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps. However, the \"London Gazette\" indicates that temporary Captain J. H. Hedley, Labour Corps, transferred to the Royal Flying Corps General List on 22 December 1917, with seniority from 4 November 1917. Captain John Hedley is credited with eleven aerial victories, all while he was with No. 20 Squadron, and all from the Bristol F.2b.\n\nThe aviator was given the nickname \"The Luckiest Man Alive\" by Floyd Gibbons, \"Chicago Tribune\" war correspondent during World War I. John Hedley claimed that while in aerial combat with German fighters in early 1918, his pilot Reginald \"Jimmy\" Makepeace put their plane into an abrupt nosedive, and Hedley tumbled out of the aircraft. The pilot continued his rapid descent for several hundred feet. However, when the plane pulled up, the ejected observer Hedley purportedly grabbed the tail and climbed back into his seat. It was thought that Hedley had been caught in the slipstream of the plane and had been brought down at the same velocity as the aircraft. The shaken pilot and observer then returned safely to their base.\n\nOn 27 March 1918, Captains John Herbert Hedley and Robert Kirby Kirkman in Bristol F.2b (B1156) were shot down by Leutnant Karl Gallwitz of Jasta 2. Both survived the crash without injuries and were captured. For many years, it was mistakenly thought that Hedley and Kirkman had been taken down by none other than Manfred von Richthofen himself. On 12 March 1918, Hedley was recommended for four aircraft destroyed, four aircraft sent out of control, and one balloon deflated. He received the French Croix de Guerre, gazetted on 28 April 1918. Hedley indicated that he also received the Belgian Croix de Guerre. Captain Hedley spent most of the rest of the year in a German prisoner of war camp, and was repatriated from Germany on 13 December 1918.\n\nNote: \"The Aerodrome\" disagrees with Norman Franks with regard to the pilots involved in the above victories. Instead, Makepeace is listed for victories 3 and 4, and Kirkman for Victories 7, 8, and 9. In addition, after the war, John Hedley indicated that he had scored thirteen aerial victories, twelve planes and one balloon.\n\nAfter Captain Hedley's return to England, his second son, Sidney Roland Hedley, was born in 1920. The former prisoner of war immigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City on 31 October 1920. His wife and children immigrated the following year, arriving in New York on 22 August 1921. They resided on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Cook, Illinois, where John Herbert Hedley, Sr. was naturalised on 3 May 1926.\n\nJohn Hedley apparently was very successful on the lecture circuit in 1920s and early 1930s, regaling American crowds with the story of his near-death experiences in (and out) of the cockpit that had earned him his nickname, \"The Luckiest Man Alive.\" The lecture that the former observer ace gave on a number of occasions was entitled \"Rambling Through the Air\". It appears that the talks took place most frequently between 1928 and 1930, often in Illinois, but also in other states such as Indiana and Wisconsin. Hedley thrilled a variety of audiences as he recounted his military experiences, from his initial service with the British Army in 1914 to his time as a prisoner of war until late 1918. The highlight of his lecture was almost always his account of being thrown out of the plane three miles above the earth, falling two or three hundred feet, and landing back on the tail of his aircraft. However, in one newspaper account, there is the suggestion that his version of the account differed. The journalist indicated that Hedley had \"retained his grasp on the macine (\"sic\") gun.\" The aviator claimed to have fought Richthofen's Circus three times, as a member of the 20th Squadron of the Royal Flying Corps, with the final encounter resulting in his aircraft being shot down in flames by Manfred von Richthofen. Press reviews of his lectures were rather complimentary. It was not until many years later that the assertion regarding the Red Baron was disproved.\n\nJohn Hedley's incredible tale was included among the anecdotes in the 1929 book \"Luck: Your Silent Partner\" by Lothrop Stoddard. In 1930, John Hedley was still living in Chicago, with his wife and two sons. His occupation at that time was reported to be a lawyer. By 1942, the year of the United States World War II draft registration, Hedley resided in Dayton, Ohio. At the time of an interview conducted in 1960, Hedley was living in Hollywood as a retired accountant. John Herbert Hedley died in Los Angeles on 1 April 1977.\n\nDespite his death, the former aviator still appears to have an audience. In 2009, the story of Hedley's bizarre mishap in 1918 was included in the book \"Strange But True, America: Weird Tales from All 50 States\". In addition, John Herbert Hedley and his incredible tale were the subject of the 2011 YouTube video \"The Luckiest Man Alive! – Strange as it Seems (2011)\".\n\n"}
{"id": "31191412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31191412", "title": "Journalism and freedom", "text": "Journalism and freedom\n\n\"Journalism and Freedom\" was an article by Rupert Murdoch that appeared in \"The Wall Street Journal\" 's online \"Opinion Journal\" on 8 December 2009. \n\n\"Journalism and Freedom\" was adapted from a speech given by Murdoch (Chairman and CEO of News Corporation) at the Federal Trade Commission's Workshop on Journalism and the Internet, held on 1 December 2009. In this article Murdoch discusses his views on government involvement in the press in the form of subsidies, the outdated \"20th century business models\" of newspapers which rely on advertising revenues and the detrimental effects these have on creators of established news content and the newspaper industry as a whole. He also argues that government funding compromises independent journalism and is a greater threat to competitive and unbiased press than digital technologies are. Also discussed is the impact of internet search engines and open content news material available online and new methods and models of content delivery portal electronic devices and media (e-readers, smart phones, laptops) and how this will affect delivery of news content in the future.\n\nThe debate surrounding \"Journalism and Freedom\" has focused on the threat of new technologies, and the role that they play in the decline of traditional newspapers. Murdoch does not blame new technologies for the decline of newspapers, rather the lack of regulation which allows journalists content to be used without payment. He sees the opportunities technologies can bring, creating a much wider audience for newspapers. Opinions have also been voiced concerning government interventions and the suitability of these as a way of rescuing the industry. Other revenue and business models have been proposed as an alternative to existing ones, as traditional models are failing.\n\nA report in 2009 highlighted the decline of newspaper circulation as figures showed that the industry as a whole sold fewer newspapers than at any other time since the 1940s. Within the report, free online content and business models were blamed for their part in the downturn; an opinion in agreement with Murdoch's article.\n\"The Wall Street Journal\"'s circulation in 2009 defied the trend as their circulation rose 0.6% and in 2010 they topped the list of circulating figures for American newspapers . The \"Journal\" sells online subscriptions, which is seen as a reason for their success.\n\nTraditional print based media relies heavily upon advertisements and classified adverts for the generation of the majority of their revenue, which accounts for upwards of three quarters of total income. This subsidy covers the expensive printing and distribution costs of the publication which was estimated to be between 30-40% and 11% respectively of total operating costs in 2006. Although online advertisements revenue have overtaken their print counterparts recently, the vast majority of this is spent on search engines and pay-per-click content rather than more traditional advertising on news websites such as banners.\n\nUsers do not appear willing to pay for general digital news content. Publications such as the \"New York Times\" have launched premium subscription based content \"TimeSelect\" in the past but uptake was low and it was eventually removed, but this is not to say that users will never pay for content, yet as of now it has not been successful for a mainstream publication as a method of generating revenue. James Jarvis, an American journalist, stated that \"\"TimesSelect\" is dead...with it goes any hope of charging for content online, Content is now and forever free\". One reason for this is that there is an abundance of free sources online for news, therefore few users will feel the need to pay for content that is available without charge elsewhere. Murdoch states that it is his belief that users in the future will indeed be willing to pay for digital news if the content is worthy, which is evident in the recent launch of \"The Daily\", an iPad-only daily newspaper which sells at 99 cents (US) per week. In the UK, \"The Times\" newspaper (also owned by Murdoch) saw its readership decline by 90% in 2010 after it introduced a paywall. In response to Murdoch's article, Kathy Gill claims that customers will not pay for content that is available elsewhere for free and that there needs to be a distinction made between what they will and won't pay for. There are also claims of hypocrisy in what Murdoch says as \"The Wall Street Journal\" has been criticised for not providing links to competitors in their own articles.\n\nThe globalisation of media and the new formats available are seen by Murdoch as an opportunity and the increased competition created good for consumers. People no longer want to be restricted by one format so newspapers must adapt their delivery models. Murdoch states that the customer base newspapers already have is an advantage as they can attract readers equally to their online versions. The standard of journalism is also likely to be more professional. Murdoch's vision of the future for newspapers online is that if readers are targeted and the content offered is of a high quality, people will be willing to pay for it.\n\nAs Murdoch states, readers use different technology platforms to access news content. Portable devices with considerably better processors, such as smartphones, laptops and tablet PCs which has made the gathering and dissemination of information much easier and increased the connection possibilities of news content which can be accessed by a larger number of people. Availability of news has now become considerabley more selective and flexible in terms of where it can be accessed. This means that it is likely that those who seek online news will consume more news in general as those who purchase the physical copy of the newspaper will be more and not less likely to access the same publications website. Murdoch states that adherence to business models based upon advertising on the part of news papers is responsible for declining revenues. Additionally, those who consume a lot of news offline will access online news more frequently. This, he argues, means that journalists and readers alike have perhaps been able to research more thoroughly using search engines, stumbling serendipitously upon sources online which they may not have encountered in an analogue environment. This has given rise to new challenges for media organisations in terms of delivering content to users. .\n\nIt is debatable whether online and offline news content are competing or complementary products. Some argue that the Internet presents too much competition for traditional newspapers. In terms of trust, there is also an assumption that news content delivered online may be inferior to content delivered by newspapers. However, there is also the issue of users finding online content less trust worthy. This could be linked to it being free and assumption that online news content is possibly less likeable, satisfying and enjoyable. However, as the article discuss, technology is not necessarily the cause of the decline in revenues from traditional news paper formats. Others. like Google CEO Eric Schmidt say that technology is definitely not to blame and can actually help newspapers to progress and avoid decline. Obsolescence of single delivery format is unlikely as both print and online serve different purposes and audiences.\n\nMurdoch also attacks news aggregator services, which he sees as being parasitic in that they are benefiting from news which they have not created or contributed to in any way. This refers to news websites who gather content for users, which allow them to access news stories on multiple sources, often on one specified area or topic of interest in order to save them time and effort but also blogs and even websites such as Yahoo! News and MSN. He comments that this it is particularly unfair to edit and rewrite articles that journalists have invested their time and effort in, especially in cases when they are not cited as being the original author or plagiarised. \nHe challenges that this kind of behaviour constitutes fair use and that those who do not contribute or create the news content that they publish on their websites or blogs can profit from the efforts of the aforementioned journalist while adding very little themselves. Also that this current practice cannot continue indefinitely.\nMurdoch's statements were attacked by \"Huffington Post\" founder Arianna Huffington stating that \"Murdoch confused aggregation with wholesale misappropriation\". She argued that aggregation was not misappropriation and that most journalists liked the traffic consequently driven to them. Also, Murdoch's own companies were as guilty for aggregating content like the political tracker on Fox News.com and the Rotten Tomatoes web site.\n\nThe level of financial support for newspapers from the American Government is decreasing and some believe this is a factor in the decline of the traditional newspaper industry. One instance of where governments have withdrawn from the industry came with the rise of e-government, bringing about less of a need for local authorities to pay for advertising space in newspapers.\n\nThere is a debate between those who are calling for more government funding to support the industry and others who believe this would be contrary to free speech and create unfair competition. Similar examinations are occurring in other countries as countries like Austria, France Norway and Sweden are looking to change their current subsidy models. It is possible for news organisations to receive public money and still maintain neutrality, most notably, the BBC. Tension also exists between direct subsidies like help with printing, distribution, research, and training, and indirect subsidies like tax concessions. Indirect subsidies are a more common model of government intervention.\n\nChanges in government legislation is seen as another option. The example of the U.S. auto industry has been brought up to demonstrate that the newspaper industry needs more than financing to survive. Murdoch asserts that newspapers themselves need to look at new ways of surviving, competing and generating revenue as government financing merely \"props up those who are producing things that customers do not want\". As Murdoch suggests, new business models need to be created and the industry – along with government - needs to be more proactive. Better legislation concerning newspapers and for the protection of newspapers is, says Murdoch, the best way to ensure the future of quality journalism.\n\nLegislation was introduced in 2009 by senator Ben Cardin of Maryland to help struggling newspapers. Under section 501(c) of the U.S. tax code, newspapers could become nonprofits and thus benefit from tax breaks similar to those awarded to charities, and educational and cultural nonprofits. So far, the bill has not progressed in Congress and it is questioned whether newspapers with existing debt would be able to be saved by this.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is also looking into protecting newspapers through policy. New ways of generating revenue, greater protection of intellectual property (an area Murdoch expresses concern about), a redefining of \"fair use\", and potential areas of government intervention are discussed in the FTC's \"Potential Policy Recommendations to support the reinvention of Journalism\".\n\nThere is also a case for no intervention at all, and that newspapers must find their own way. If this results in some of them ceasing to exist, this is merely the reflection of the market. It may also encourage newspapers to find their own way of dealing with the downturn, perhaps through greater emphasis on collaboration with each other.\n\nMurdoch's article calls for the government to reassess its regulation of news corporation ownership and copyright legislation. He believes that the governments role should be to protect the intellectual property of the newspapers and their journalists, get rid of regulations which hinder investment, and not restrict Cross ownership in the media. The relaxing of regulation could lead to less choice for consumers. American news is dominated by 5 corporations (including Murdoch's) and a change in cross-ownership rules could hinder other news companies from prospering.\n\n"}

He has released several studio albums and experienced significant commercial success as a blues artist.\n\nShepherd was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. He graduated from Caddo Magnet High School in Shreveport. He is \"completely self-taught\",\n\nShepherd stated in a 2011 interview that he began playing guitar in earnest at age seven, about six months after meeting and being \"pretty mesmerized\" by Stevie Ray Vaughan, Labor Day weekend in 1984, at one of his father's promoted concerts. His self-taught method employed a process of learning one note at a time, playing and rewinding cassette tapes, using \"a cheap Yamaha wanna-be Stratocaster...made out of plywood, basically\", and learning to play by following along with material from his father's record collection.\n\nBlues musician Bryan Lee invited 13 year old Shepherd to play guitar onstage. He subsequently made demo tapes, and a video was shot at Shepherd's first performance at the Red River Revel Arts Festival in Shreveport. It was this video performance that impressed Giant Records chief Irving Azoff enough to sign Shepherd to a multiple album record deal.\n\nFrom 1995 on, Shepherd took seven singles into the Top 10, and holds the record for the longest-running album on the \"Billboard\" Blues Charts with \"Trouble Is...\". In 1996, Shepherd began a longtime collaboration with vocalist Noah Hunt, who provided the vocals for Shepherd's signature song, \"Blue on Black\". Shepherd has been nominated for five Grammy Awards, and has received two Billboard Music Awards, two Blues Music Awards, and two Orville H. Gibson Awards.\n\nIn 2000, Shepherd played guitar on the end title theme for the animated feature \"\".\n\nIn September 2008, Fender Musical Instruments Corp. released the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Signature Series Stratocaster, designed exclusively by Shepherd. In 2007, he released a critically acclaimed and two time Grammy nominated DVD–CD project, \"\". This documents Shepherd as he travels the country to jam with and interview the last of the authentic blues musicians. As they tour the backroads, Shepherd, with members of the Double Trouble Band, play with a host of blues greats including Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown and Bryan Lee, Buddy Flett (with whom he jams at Lead Belly's grave), B. B. King, blues harp master Jerry \"Boogie\" McCain, Cootie Stark, Neal Pattman, John Dee Holeman, Etta Baker, Henry Townsend with Honeyboy Edwards, and a concert session with the surviving members of Muddy Waters' and Howlin' Wolf's bands, including luminaries such as Hubert Sumlin, Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith, and Pinetop Perkins. \n\nIn 2010 Shepherd was nominated for a Grammy for \"Live In Chicago\" which featured performances with Hubert Sumlin, Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith, Buddy Flett and Bryan Lee. In 2011, Shepherd released his seventh CD entitled \"How I Go\" on Roadrunner Records. In 2014 he released \"Goin Home\" on Mascot Label Group in Europe and on Concord Records in the US and the rest of the world. In 2015 Shepherd released \"Something From the Road Vol. 1,\" a live special release for Record Store Day in the U.S.\n\nIn January 2017 the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band went into the studio with producer Marshall Altman to record a new album of all newly written songs titled \"Lay It On Down\" and released the album on August 4 (July 21 in Europe on \"Mascot Label Group\"). \"Lay It On Down\" is the eighth record by the Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Blues Chart.\n\nIn 2013, Shepherd, along with Stephen Stills (Crosby, Stills & Nash) and Barry Goldberg (Electric Flag), formed The Rides. The three wrote, recorded, and released a CD entitled \"Can't Get Enough\" on August 27, 2013. Stills refers to the band as \"the blues band of my dreams\". The band toured the US in 2013 supporting their debut record, culminating with an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The three reunited in 2015, writing and recording a second release, \"Pierced Arrow\" that was released on 429 Records and Mascot Label Group in Europe in 2016.\n\nShepherd married Hannah Gibson, the daughter of actor Mel Gibson, on September 16, 2006.

The aim of the operation was to encircle Aleppo and cut rebel supply lines into the city, thus besieging rebel-held areas.\n\nOn 7 December 2013, an air raid on the town of Bezaa killed at least 20 people, including eight children and nine women.\n\nBetween 15 and 28 December, a series of Army helicopter attacks with barrel bombs against rebel-held areas of Aleppo left 517 people dead, including 151 children, 46 women and 46 rebels, according to the SOHR. 76 of those killed died on the first day alone, while 93–100 people were killed on 22 December. By 18 December, 879 people were wounded. During the first four days the attacks were concentrated on Aleppo city, but on 19 December, the helicopter strikes were expanded to include surrounding villages. A rebel commander claimed that by 26 December, more than 1,000 people had been killed in the bombing campaign. By the end of 6 January, the death toll in the bombings had risen to 603, including 172 children, 54 women and 52 rebels. On 9 January, aid groups stated more than 700 people had been killed since the start of the bombing campaign.\n\nOn 25 December, pro-government sources claimed that the Syrian Army captured the al-Jbanat area near Aleppo's al-Sheikh Maqsoud neighbourhood.\n\nOn 11 January 2014, government forces secured the area of al-Naqqarin and Sheikh Yusuf hill and were advancing towards the industrial area of Aleppo city. According to opposition activists, the rebels were in fear of losing the industrial district, which would cut their supply lines from Turkey. The next day, the Army also advanced towards the highway linking the airport to the government-held western part of the city.\n\nOn 14 January, the Army reportedly captured al-Zarzour, al-Taaneh, al-Subeihieh and Height 53 on the eastern outskirts of Aleppo. On 15 January, an Al-Manar correspondent reported that the Army captured al-Sabaheyya, al-Faory and Tal-Riman, east of Al-Safira, and was pushing towards the electricity station, northeast of Al-Safira. Later, Al-Manar claimed that the Army captured Tall Alam and Huwejna, east of Aleppo, also on the approaches to the electricity station. At the same time, government troops pushed out of Kweires military airport, east of Aleppo and the station, and captured villages around the base.\n\nOn 17 January, the Army bombarded the villages of Tal-Na'am, Jobul and Tal-Estabel and captured the village of Tal-Sobeha. By 18 January, it was confirmed government troops captured the town of Tall Alam, just west of the power plant. Sheikh Zayat, on the southern outskirts of the industrial zone, was also captured.\n\nOn 21 January, clashes took place around the village of Balat, accompanied by an air raid on the village.\n\nOn 22 January, the Army made an attempt to advance on the central Aziziyeh district of Aleppo city. At the same time, the town of Aziza, on the southern outskirts of Aleppo, came under rebel attack which was continuing as of 24 January. On 25 January, the Army captured the neighborhood of Karam Al Qasr on the eastern side of Aleppo city, after three days of fighting.\n\nOn 27 January, fighting was renewed in the area of the Umayyad Mosque in Aleppo's Old City, as the rebels claimed of destroying a Hezbollah base at Mount Hoihna and capturing most of the buildings in the town Maarath Al-Artik, on Aleppo's northwest outskirts.\n\nOn 28 January, rebels captured the Maarath Al-Artik mountain, which the Army used to shell nearby rebel-held towns. On the same day, the Army made more advances and seized the districts of Ballura and Kasr al-Tarrab, according to the pro-government al-Watan newspaper. It too said that an operation had been launched from Nairab airport in the east, as well as Aziza village in the south, while adding that troops had reached the outskirts of Mayssar, a rebel bastion in southeast Aleppo. At the same time, the SOHR confirmed the military captured the Karm al-Qasr district, on the southeastern edge of Aleppo, and reported that residents of Mayssar, Marjeh and Enzarrat districts were fleeing their homes for \"neighbourhoods controlled by regime forces because of the fighting\".\n\nDuring the month of January, government forces also pushed into the Old City district of Aleppo and captured the Farafra area.\n\nOn 2 February, the \"Al-Watan\" newspaper announced that the Army captured most of the eastern Karam al-Turab district of Aleppo.\n\nOn 16 February, government forces captured the village of Sheikh Najjar, south of the industrial zone, as well as Talet al-Ghali, on the eastern outskirts of Aleppo. On 19 February, rebels claimed to had recaptured Sheikh Najjar, while, the SOHR stated it was unclear who controlled the area. The next day, the Army re-secured Sheikh Najjar and captured two strategic hills that overlook the eastern neighborhoods of Aleppo, al-Ghalia and Syriatel.\n\nOn 24 February, the Army made progress in the Sheikh Najjar industrial zone, with rebels sending reinforcements to the area. The military was attempting to capture strategic areas in Sheikh Najjar that overlook the outskirts of the Aleppo central prison, which had been under a rebel siege for over a year. The Army hoped to station artillery at those positions to help fend off attacks on the prison. The next day, the military captured the factory of the Zanoubia ceramic company in the southern al-Sheikh Sa'id district of Aleppo. Soldiers, NDF militiamen and Hezbollah fighters also captured new positions near Base 80, putting them one kilometer from the Tariq al-Bab district. The area they captured included the districts of Talat Barkat and al-Ard al-Hamra.\n\nOn 27 February, the military reportedly captured Brakat hill, reaching to the east of the al-Sakan al-Shababi area of Aleppo city.\n\nOn 2 March, government forces captured the Majbal al-Zeft area near the Aleppo central prison, as well as the Al-Khaledia neighborhood of Aleppo city. The next day, there were conflicting claims of the takeover of the Al-Majbal area with both the Army and the opposition claiming to be in control. The military also claimed to be on the verge of breaking the siege of the prison after capturing 60 percent of the industrial zone and surrounding the rebels in the area.\n\nAt this time, rebels attempted to halt the Army advance on Aleppo's outskirts by attacking government-held villages south of the city, and thus trying to block the Army supply route (Aleppo-Khanaser-Hama). However, military reinforcements arrived to reinforce these positions and the attempted rebel advance was stopped.\n\nOn 9 March, fighting was once again raging around Al-Majbal hill, near the central prison. By this point, government forces had captured a strategic hill, where they positioned artillery to bombard rebel positions around the prison.\n\nIn early May, government forces captured the Al-Majbal area and the Breij roundabout, thus taking control of the northeastern entrance to Aleppo. This also brought government forces close to the central prison. The Army also reached the al-Kindi Hospital.\n\nWithin a week, rebels made claims to had retaken several points in Bureij, amid the arrival of hundreds of rebel reinforcements from Idlib, Hama and Aleppo provinces. According to the SOHR, 21 rebel fighters and 30 pro-government fighters were killed in the clashes, in addition to three disabled Army tanks. However, other opposition sources denied the claim saying rebel forces had made no progress in the Bureij area. Despite this, rebels managed to retake the al-Majbal area at the cost of at least 27 fighters, while the Army suffered several casualties.\n\nOn 20 May, the Army captured the Sheikh Najjar power plant and Agop hill right next to it, which opened the way towards the central prison, bringing government troops to one kilometer from the prison complex. There were also reports that some troops had already arrived to reinforce the prison. After the capture of the hill, the military attacked the village of Hilan, which is the last rebel stronghold before the prison. The Army was also still engaged in Sector 2 of the industrial complex.\n\nThe next day, the military captured Hilan, as government forces had broken through on the road leading to the prison. At the same time, rebels blew up the Kindi hospital in fear it could be used for monitoring rebel supply routes if the advancing government troops managed to capture it. Soon after, Army tanks had reached and taken up positions at about 500 meters from the prison complex. The area was witnessing heavy artillery shelling, with government troops dropping at least 30 barrel bombs from military helicopters over the previous 24 hours, as rebel forces were fast retreating from the area due to the government's superior firepower. During the two days of fighting, at least 50 rebels were killed.\n\nOn 22 May, the Army had finally broken the siege of the prison as tanks and armored vehicles entered the complex. The Air Force dropped more than 100 barrel bombs during the final push to reach the prison. This put the north-east approach to Aleppo under the control of government forces.\n\nBy 25 May, the military was in control of Sector 1 of the industrial zone and had captured the town of Jbeileh next to the prison.\n\nOn 30 May, the SOHR reported almost 2,000 people had been killed in Aleppo by barrel bomb strikes since the start of January.\n\nOn 3 July, after an assault which included 20 airstrikes, government forces fully captured the industrial district. This left the Infantry Academy and the Handarat camp as the only two rebel-held areas the Army would need to capture to complete the siege of Aleppo, after three major rebel supply routes had been cut.\n\nDays later, government reinforcements arrived, which included members of the elite Republican Guards and Hezbollah, and the military captured the villages of Kafr al-Saghir and Moqbila, advancing towards the Infantry Academy. Rebel reinforcements had also been dispatched to Aleppo, however, one brigade numbering 1,000 fighters that was supposedly sent from Idlib province to reinforce opposition forces in Aleppo city used the chance and defected to the rival extremist ISIS organisation.\n\nThe slow pace with which the Army advanced since the start of the operation was described as deliberate so the military could have time to consolidate control over captured territory. According to one diplomat, \"They haven't lost any areas they have taken back. It is not a battle of back-and-forth.\"\n\nBy mid-August, only three miles remained before the military could completely cut rebel supply lines into the city, after the opposition forces’ position deteriorated in the previous month following failed rebel counterattacks that attempted to dislodge government troops from the industrial zone. The rebels also attempted to capture the military academy in the western outskirts of the city, in an attempt to force government forces to reposition from the east to the west. However, the attack ended in catastrophe after the rebels were exposed to repeated air strikes, even at night, that made it impossible to move men and weapons freely.\n\nGovernment forces had also captured two hills and three villages in the western Aleppo countryside, while there were competing claims over the town of Khan Tuman. On 18 August, the Army captured Khan Tuman hill.\n\nBetween 20 and 23 August, heavy fighting raged at the Handarat district, which was reportedly being besieged by government forces, while the military claimed to had captured the village of Jbeileh, which the rebels used to conduct attacks on the prison. Shortly after the capture of Jbeileh, the Army attacked the \"cement factory\", with expectations it would be captured within a few hours.\n\nOn 24 August, the military captured Mount Azzan, after forcing rebel forces to retreat to the south, while government troops advanced from Jbeileh to the west towards Al-Muslimiyyah and captured two neighborhoods in the village.\n\nOn 3 October, following a two-month stalemate, the Army, supported by the NDF, Hezbollah, Al-Quds Brigades and Ba'ath Brigades, finally captured the village of Handarat and its hill, thus cutting off one of the two last rebel supply lines for opposition-held areas in Aleppo city. The Army quickly erected barriers on the road so it would be closed off. Government forces also captured the villages of al-Mudafah and Sifat and a four-way intersection west of Sifat. Later, the rebels counter-attacked in an attempt to recapture the hill. 45 rebels and 32 soldiers were killed during the day's fighting. The final supply route, via the Castello Road and al-Jandul roundabout, came under constant air-strikes and was monitored.\n\nOn 9 October, the Army secured the Handarat farms and the village of Babinnis, just south of the rebel-controlled infantry school.\n\nOn 13 October, the rebels made advances that could possibly cut off the supply roads to the Army-held Sifat, Handarat and Handarat base.\n\nOn 18 October, the Army captured the village of al-Jbayleh, the cement plant and the glass factory, north of the prison, ending the rebel's attempts to isolate the Army in Sifat and Handarat. The next day, the Army also captured the village of Al-Muslimiyya.\n\nOn 20 October, the military made further advances and captured the Halabi Farms (Mazra’a Halabi) and Tal Madafa, the highest hill in the province which is located north of Handarat.\n\nIn early November, the last remaining rebel supply route, the Castello Road, was within firing range of the Syrian Army and they were in position to close it off at any time, but were still leaving it open, possibly to give a chance to anyone who wanted to leave the city before they implemented the siege.\n\n"}
{"id": "14439289", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14439289", "title": "Ottoman–Hungarian wars", "text": "Ottoman–Hungarian wars\n\nThe Ottoman–Hungarian Wars were a series of battles between the Ottoman Empire and the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Following the Byzantine Civil War, the Ottoman capture of Gallipoli, and the decisive Battle of Kosovo, the Ottoman Empire was poised to conquer the entirety of the Balkans and also sought and expressed desire to expand further north into Central Europe beginning with the Hungarian lands.\n\nInitial Hungarian success culminated in the Crusade of Varna, though without significant outside support the Hungarians were defeated. Nonetheless the Ottomans suffered more defeats at Belgrade, even after the conquest of Constantinople. In particular, the notorious Vlad the Impaler, with limited Hungarian help, resisted Ottoman rule until the Ottomans placed his brother, a man less feared and less hated by the populace, on the throne of Wallachia. Ottoman success was once again halted at Moldavia due to Hungarian intervention, but the Turks finally succeeded when Moldavia and then Belgrade fell to Bayezid II and Suleiman the Magnificent, respectively. In 1526 the Ottomans crushed the Hungarian army at Mohács with King Louis II of Hungary perishing along with 14,000-20,000 of his foot soldiers. Following this defeat, the eastern region of the Kingdom of Hungary (mainly Transylvania) became an Ottoman tributary state, constantly engaged in civil war with Royal Hungary. The war continued with the Habsburgs now asserting primacy in the conflict with Suleiman and his successors. The northern and most of the central parts of Hungary managed to remain free from Ottoman rule, but the Kingdom of Hungary, the most powerful state east of Vienna under Matthias II, was now divided and constantly threatened by Ottoman ambitions in the region.\n\nIn the century after the death of Osman I in 1326, Ottoman rule began to extend over the eastern Mediterranean and the Balkans. The important city of Thessaloniki was captured from the Venetians in 1387, and the Turkish victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389 effectively marked the end of Serbian power in the region, paving the way for Ottoman expansion into the rest of Europe.\n\nIn 1344 Louis I of Hungary, who would rule from 1342–1382 and earn the epithet \"the Great\", invaded Wallachia and Moldavia and established a system of vassalage.\n\nLouis and his 80,000 strong army repelled the Serbian Dušan's armies in the duchies of Mačva and principality of Travunia in 1349. When Czar Dušan broke into Bosnian territory he was defeated by Bosnian Stjepan II with the assistance of Louis' troops, and when Dušan made a second attempt he was decisively beaten by Louis in 1354. The two monarchs signed a peace agreement in 1355.\nHis latter campaigns in the Balkans were aimed not so much at conquest and subjugation as at drawing the Serbs, Bosnians, Wallachians and Bulgarians into the fold of the Roman Catholic faith and at forming a united front against the Turks. It was relatively easy to subdue the Balkan Orthodox countries by arms, but to convert them was a different matter. Despite Louis' efforts, the peoples of the Balkans remained faithful to the Eastern Orthodox Church and their attitude toward Hungary remained ambiguous. Louis annexed Moldavia in 1352 and established a vassal principality there, before conquering Vidin in 1365. The rulers of Serbia, Walachia, Moldavia, and Bulgaria became his vassals. They regarded powerful Hungary as a potential menace to their national identity. For this reason, Hungary could never regard the Serbs and Wallachians as reliable allies in subsequent wars against the Turks.\n\nIn the spring of 1365, Louis headed a campaign against the Bulgarian Tsardom of Vidin and its ruler Ivan Sratsimir. He seized the city of Vidin on 2 May 1365; the region was under Hungarian rule until 1369.\n\nIn 1366 Byzantine Emperor John V visited Hungary to beg for help against the Ottoman Turks, who were in increasing conflict with the Balkan vassal states. Louis defeated the Turks when Hungarian and Turkish troops clashed for the first time in history at Nicapoli in 1366. He defeated the Turkish army in Wallachia in 1374.\n\nThe Battle of Nicopolis (25 September 1396) is thought to be the first large-scale encounter between Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, where a broad alliance of Christian monarchs and the Knights Hospitaller were defeated by a numerically superior Turkish army (the Ottomans had also enlisted the support of their new vassal, the Serbian Despotate).\n\nDespite these successes the Ottomans were dealt a major setback when at Ankara in 1402 Timur of the Chagatai Khanate captured the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid the Thunderbolt (so named for the speed of his crushing victories against his Christian opponents, most notably at Nicopolis). After a decade of internecine battles, Mehmed I emerged victorious and reestablished the Ottoman Empire, although under the suzerainty of the Byzantine Emperor.\n\nMurad II, the successor to Mehmed I, proved to be a man of far greater military skills then his peaceful predecessor. In 1422, no longer professing suzerainty to the Byzantines, he laid siege to Constantinople, which narrowly avoided becoming an Ottoman conquest. However he had managed to capture lands surrounding Constantinople. \n\nWith Byzantium no longer a threat, Murad II began his war against his Christian opponents, attacking Macedonia and capturing Thessalonika from the Venetians in 1430. Between 1435 and 1436 the Ottomans made a show of strength in Albania, but the country survived due to intervention from the Kingdom of Hungary, whose borders now neared those of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nIn the 1440s and 1450s, the Hungarian military leader John Hunyadi became the key architect of campaigns against the Ottoman Empire. In 1441 he scored a pitched battle victory at Semendria over Ishak Bey. The following year, he annihilated an Ottoman force invading Transylvania at Sibiu. Following this victory, Wallachia again accepted the suzerainty of the Kingdom of Hungary. With the help of knights from western Europe, Hunyadi succeeded in capturing Nis on November 3, 1443, defeating another Turkish army as they crossed the Balkan Mountains and then taking another victory on Christmas Day. Because supplies for the Crusader army were low, Hunyadi concluded a ten-year peace treaty with Murad II, presumably on Hunyadi's terms, for it was the triumphant Hungarian that entered Buda in February 1444. Ten years was the maximum time permitted by Islamic law for a treaty with an \"infidel\". The peace was short lived, as Cardinal Julian Cesarini incited the Hungarians to break the treaty and attack the Turks once more. However, much of the Crusader armies' strength had been reduced due to the loss (by defection) of Serbia, Albania and the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe Crusader army attacked across the Danube. Murad, upon hearing of the Christian breach of the treaty, is said to have mounted the broken treaty on his standard and said the words, \"Christ, if you are God as your followers claim, punish them for their perfidy\". The two armies met on November 10, 1444 near Varna in eastern Bulgaria. Accounts vary as to how many troops were present but the Crusaders may have been 30,000 strong whilst the Ottoman forces were two to three times larger. Nonetheless, Hunyadi's successful defense wagons held the line until King Ladislas led a charge to his death against the Turkish lines. His head was mounted on a spear where all the defeated Crusaders could see it. Few Crusaders survived the battle, although Hunyadi did escape with his life.\n\nThe Hungarians recovered their strength after Varna and Hunyadi was able to lead another expedition down the Danube. Turkish counter-attacks saw this \"crusade\" driven back. After Murad dealt with the Greeks at the Peloponesse and others who had fought him at Varna, he turned his attention to Albania, whose leader, once an Ottoman hostage, was now a popular resistance leader. Hunyadi could not refuse an offer to fight the Turks and in 1448 an army of some 24,000 Hungarians marched south into Serbia. At the Second Battle of Kosovo Murad scored another victory against the Hungarians. This time, Hunyadi had had enough and was unable to campaign against the Ottoman Sultan. Murad II passed on his powers to his successor, Mehmed II. Thanks to such victories, the Ottoman forces were able to capture Constantinople in 1453 with only the Italians offering minimal support to the Byzantines.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ottoman issue had again become acute, and, after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Sultan Mehmed II was rallying his resources to subjugate Hungary. His immediate objective was Nándorfehérvár (today Belgrade). Nándorfehérvár was a major castle-fortress, and a gatekeeper of south Hungary. The fall of this stronghold would have opened a clear way to the heart of Central Europe. Hunyadi arrived at the Siege of Belgrade at the end of 1455, after settling differences with his domestic enemies. At his own expense, he restocked the supplies and arms of the fortress, leaving a strong garrison there under the command of his brother-in-law Mihály Szilágyi and his own eldest son László Hunyadi. He proceeded to form a relief army, and assembled a fleet of two hundred ships. His main ally was the Franciscan friar, Giovanni da Capistrano, whose fiery oratory drew a large crusade made up mostly of peasants. Although relatively ill-armed (most were armed with farm equipment, such as scythes and pitchforks) they flocked to Hunyadi and his small corps of seasoned mercenaries and cavalry.\n\nOn July 14, 1456 the flotilla assembled by Hunyadi destroyed the Ottoman fleet. On July 21, Szilágyi's forces in the fortress repulsed a fierce assault by the Rumelian army, and Hunyadi pursued the retreating forces into their camp, taking advantage of the Turkish army's confused flight from the city. After fierce but brief fighting, the camp was captured, and Mehmet raised the siege and returned to Constantinople. With his flight began a 70-year period of relative peace on Hungary's southeastern border.\n\nHowever, plague broke out in Hunyadi's camp three weeks after the lifting of the siege, and he died on August 11. He was buried inside the (Roman Catholic) Cathedral of Alba Iulia (\"Gyulafehérvár\"), next to his younger brother John. Sultan Mehmet II paid him tribute: \"Although he was my enemy I feel grief over his death, because the world has never seen such a man.\"\n\nDuring the battle, Pope Callixtus III had ordered the bells of every European church to be rung every day at noon, as a call for believers to pray for the defenders of Belgrade. However, in many countries (like England and the Spanish kingdoms), news of the victory arrived before the order, and the ringing of the church bells at noon thus transformed into a commemoration of the victory. The pope never withdrew the order, and many Catholic and older Protestant churches still ring the noon bell to this day.\n\nHunyadi's son Matthias Corvinus was crowned king in Buda in 1458 at the age of 15. In 1471 Matthias renewed the Serbian Despotate in south Hungary under Vuk Grgurević for the protection of the borders against the Ottomans. In 1479 an Ottoman army, on its return home from ravaging Transylvania, was annihilated at Szászváros (modern Orăştie, 13 October 1479) in the Battle of Breadfield. The following year Matthias recaptured Jajce, drove the Ottomans from northern Serbia and instituted two new military banats, Jajce and Srebernik, from reconquered Bosnian territory.\n\nIn 1480 an Ottoman fleet seized Otranto in the Kingdom of Naples. At the earnest solicitation of the pope Matthias sent the Hungarian general, Balázs Magyar, to recover the fortress, which surrendered on 10 May 1481. Again in 1488, Matthias took Ancona under his protection for a while, occupying it with a Hungarian garrison.\n\nMehmed II's post-Constantinople troubles escalated further when the Balkan principality of Wallachia under Count Vlad III Dracul rebelled against the Ottoman Empire and declared the King of Hungary as his suzerain. The main drive for these actions was Vlad's return to his homeland after being in exile as a hostage of the Ottoman sultan. In 1461, five years after his return, Vlad initiated war with the Turks when he impaled the Turkish ambassadors demanding tribute from him and took the fortress of Giurgiu. Vlad then began a bloody assault across the Danube to the Black Sea, destroying as many of the ports as he could to prevent Ottoman naval attacks. Ottoman attempts to subdue Vlad militarily proved a failure, but his cruelty, which had terrorized his enemies, proved to be his undoing. When Mehmed offered the populace the choice of Vlad or his brother Radu, the populace chose Radu and soon Vlad was again an exile on the run. An attempt to return a few years afterwards ended in his death in battle.\n\nMehmed's army seems to have spent itself in Wallachia for the campaign against the Moldavians was shorter and yielded poorer results. In 1475 Mehmed ordered an invasion of Moldavia. Again, the Ottomans often took possession of the field but Moldavian hit-and-run tactics proved effective against the Turks. Poor roads further slowed the Ottomans until Stephen the Great was able to concentrate his forces at Vaslui. An Ottoman offensive was held in check and then finally driven from the field on 10 January 1475.\n\nThe Ottomans returned in 1476, this time assisted by their allies from Crimea, the Tartars and their newly conquered Vassal of Wallachia. Stephen knew that he did not have the resources to defend his people and evacuated them to the mountains. After a failed attack on the Ottoman vanguard Stephen seemed on the brink of defeat when King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary offered assistance. The Ottomans withdrew when the Hungarians began moving in and fighting did not resume until 1484.\n\nThe early reign of Bayezid II included a small civil war against his brother Jem, who escaped to the west. There European leaders entertained ideas of installing a pro-Western sultan while sending a crusade to the Balkans. Consequently, Bayezid did not incite any serious wars with his Christian opponents until his brother's death in 1495. In the meantime Bayezid signed a ten-year peace with Hungary in 1484, although this did not prevent a defeat of an Ottoman army at Villach in 1493. Between 1484 and 1486 Bayezid campaigned annually against Moldavia in an attempt to subdue it and link up with Crimea, his Muslim vassal and ally. Despite two defeats in 1485 and 1486 Moldavia was subjugated. As Bayezid's reign drew to a close he was entangled in a civil war between his sons Ahmed and Selim. Eventually Selim took the throne in 1512 and for the next eight years continued minor conquests in the west, although his main achievement was the conquest of the Mamluke Sultanate. It would be Selim's successor, Suleiman who would continue the war against Hungary.\n\nSuleiman the Magnificent resumed the war against Hungary by attacking the city of Belgrade, the same settlement that had defied Mehmed II over half a century earlier. Despite strong resistance, the city fell to Suleiman. In 1522 Suleiman took his army to a strategically successful siege of Rhodes, allowing the Knights Hospital to evacuate for the fort.\n\nWhen Suleiman launched an invasion in 1526 the Grand Vizier constructed a great bridge ahead of the Sultan allowing his army to march into Hungary. Despite eighty days of marching and taking five days to cross the Danube River, the Ottomans met no resistance from the Hungarians. The original plan of Hungarian King Louis II had been to send a vanguard to hold the Danube where the Ottomans were expected to cross, yet the nobles of the Kingdom refused to follow the King's deputy in battle, claiming that they did so out of zealous allegiance to the King (and would therefore only follow him). Consequently, when King Louis II took the field his army of 36,000 men seemed to be doomed to fail against the Ottomans' 80,000. At Mohács the plains of Hungary allowed the heavier Christian knights to launch an effective charge. As the Hungarian knights brushed aside first the Akinjis and then the Sipahis, the Ottoman cavalry regrouped and flanked the Knights inflicting a moderate amount of casulties. The Sultan then placed his Janissaries and cannon into position chained up as an effective line . The Hungarian cavalry took serious casualties from the skilfully handled Turkish artillery. With the cavalry annihilated, the infantry suffered immense casualties as the weight of numbers of the Ottomans and their skill in battle took their toll. When Suleiman the Magnificent found the body of Louis II he is said to have been saddened by his untimely death.\n\nJohn Zápolya, who had been instructed by Louis II to raid the enemy's supply lines, arrived at the battle too late and fled the scene. Suleiman, however, was not ready to annex the Kingdom completely into the Ottoman realm and in that power gap, Zapolya was chosen by Hungarian electorate as their ruler. Meanwhile, at the Diet of Bratislava Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was declared King of Hungary. The surviving nobles of Hungary now had to choose between pledging allegiance to a native vassal of Suleiman and a Christian \"foreigner\".\nZápolya would rule Hungary until his death in 1540. Following his demise, Hungary was split into three parts. The north-west (present-day Slovakia, western Transdanubia and Burgenland, western Croatia and parts of north-eastern present-day Hungary) remained under Habsburg rule; although initially independent, later it became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy under the informal name Royal Hungary. The Habsburg Emperors would from then on be also crowned as Kings of Hungary.\n\nThe eastern part of the kingdom (Partium and Transylvania) became at first an independent principality, but gradually was brought under Turkish rule as a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire. The remaining central area (most of present-day Hungary), including the capital of Buda, became a province of the Ottoman Empire.\n"}

He is credited for advising against the all-out war with India to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, eventually providing an exit to Pakistan Army to deescalate the situation through diplomacy with India.\n\nParvaiz Mehdi Qureshi was born in Phalia, Punjab, India, into a Punjabi family on 1 October 1943. After graduating from a local high school, Mehdi joined the Pakistan Air Force in 1961, and shared a room with Pervez Musharraf and Aziz Mirza, whom he enjoyed his lifelong friendship, when he being was selected for their respected military academies.\n\nAfter their interview with the local commandants, Mehdi, Musharraf, and Mirza went to see the world-claim Urdu movie, \"\"Savera\" (lit. \"Dawn\")\". The next day, all three were called to reported back to their respected academies and were selected for their respected training in their arms of commission. Mehdi entered in the famed Pakistan Air Force Academy in Risalpur, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and passed out in the class of 38th GD Pilot course where he was also conferred with the Sword of Honour by the commandant of the Air Force Academy in 1964.\n\nAfter gaining commissioned in the No. 16 Squadron \"Black Panthers\" of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) as P/Off (), he qualified as the fighter pilot, flying the F-86 Sabre jet.\n\nIn 1965, P/Off () Mehdi participated in the closed air combat operations during the second war with India where he flew his F-86 Sabre against the Indian Folland Gnat. After the war, P/Off () Mehdi was promoted as F/Off () in 1966; and Flight-Lieutenant () in 1969.\n\nIn 1969, Flt-Lt. () Mehdi was then dispatched to serve in the Eastern Command of the Pakistani military in East-Pakistan, serving in the No. 14 Squadron \"Tail choppers\". In 1970, Flt-Lt. Mehdi took over the command of his No. 14 Squadron \"Tail choppers\" as its commanding officer, stationed in Dacca HQ. In 1970–71, Flt-Lt. () Mehdi actively took participation in the air operations in East Pakistan against the Indian Army and their supported insurgent group, \"Mukti Bahini\".\n\nOn 22 November 1971, Capt. Mehdi flew his combat mission while flying his F-86 Sabre in support of operation in Garipur against the Indian Air Force.\nCapt. Mehdi's capture and subsequent imprisoned occurred on 23 November 1971 when he was flying with the finger-four formation of the ground attack/bomber unit near the Eastern India when his F-86 Sabre was shot down by the .20 mm machine gun mounted on the Folland Gnat. His Wingmen, F/Off Khalil Ahmad and Wg-Cdr Chourdhri, who were also shot down, were fortunate enough to escape towards the Pakistani side of the Indo-East Pakistan border. Capt. Mehdi parachutted 50 yrs. behind the Chaugachha Upazila where he was pulled by the Indian Army soldiers, and he was physically attacked by the Indian Army soldiers before being rescued by the Captain H.S. Panag, the section commander of the Indian Army. His capture as POW made him the first Pakistani POW and was eventually taken under the custody of Captain H.S. Panag who later sent him to Fort Williams. At the time of his capture, his 9 mm pistol, survival kit, aviator glasses, and the photo of his wife was recovered by Captain H.S. Panag.\n\nHis status as the first prisoner of war made the front pages of the Indian newspapers, and the photos of his capture were widely circulated in the black-and-white television screens of the Pakistani news media. Upon hearing and watching the news, President Yahya Khan imposed the state of emergency, and ordered the military for the preparation of war with India on 23 November 1971.\n\nAccording to the East-Pakistani sources, the No. 14 Squadron \"Tail choppers\" suffered with immense casualties due to lack of effective radars that would provide them with an early warning, whereas the attacking Indian Air Force planes were directed by Indian radar controllers at Barrackpore. Photos his capture and stills taken from the combat camera were later leaked in the internet in 2010s.\n\nThe population transfer agreement signed between the Governments of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh made it possible of war prisoner to be transported back to Pakistan from India in 1973–75. Upon his return, Capt. PQ Mehdi was directed to attend the war course at the Air War College where he attained master's degree in War studies in 1976. In 1977, Squadron-Leader (), Mehdi served to join the faculty of the Combat Commanders School (CCS), a TOPGUN training school, which he remained associated with several years.\n\nFrom 1977–79, Wing-Commander () Mehdi served as the commanding officer when he commanded the No. 9 Squadron \"Griffins\", stationed in Sargodha Air Force Base. In 1981–83, Group-Captain () Mehdi was appointed as the base commander of the Sargodha AFB. During this time, Grp-Capt. () Mehdi qualified as a combat pilot to fly the F-16s.\n\nIn 1991–93, Air-Cdre () Mehdi was appointed AOC of the Southern Air Command, based in Sindh, Pakistan, and was promoted to the two-star rank, moved to command the Northern Air Command. In 1993, AVM () Mehdi took over the command of the Air Defence Command, then-based in the Chaklala AFB. In 1995, Maj-Gen. Mehdi was eventually promoted to the three-star rank, posted at the Air AHQ in Islamabad when he was appointed as DCAS (Operations), which he remained in this capacity until 1997.\n\nIn 1997, Air-Marshal ( Mehdi was elevated and appointed as the Vice Chief of Air Staff (VCAS) under then-air chief Air Chief Marshal Abbas Khattak.\n\nOn 7 November 1997, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif approved the promotion papers of Air-Mshl () PQ Mehdi to be elevated to the four-star rank, Air Chief Marshal (), and subsequently took over the command of the Pakistan Air Force as its Chief of Air Staff (CAS) on 8 November 1997. As an air chief, ACM () PQ Mehdi played a crucial role in expanding the educational scope of the Air War College in Karachi, and backed up the military's plan for enhancing its communication capabilities between the branches of the Pakistani military.\n\nIn 1998, ACM () PQ Mehdi backed and spoke in favor of authorizing the nuclear weapon testing during the national security meeting with the civilian cabinet. Gen. Mehdi issued directives to the F-16s belonging to the No. 11 Squadron \"Arrows\" to escort the C-130H to strategically airlift six-to-seven nuclear device in tight finger-four formation to the weapon-testing sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.<ref name=\"http://www.defencejournal.com/2000/june/chagai.htm, 2000\"></ref> ACM Mehdi did not comment or offered any opinion when Prime Minister Sharif relieved the military commission of then-Chairman Joint chiefs General Jehangir Karamat in 1998.\n\nACM Mehdi commanded the air force during the two-month long military confrontation with the Indian Army in 1999. During this conflict and meeting with the chairman joint chiefs, ACM Mehdi advised against having the air force involved with the Indian Air Force, quoting: \"(\"sic\")...any intervention by the Pakistan Air Force into disputed land of Indian Kashmir would be perceived as an escalation to all-out declared war.\" Despite the strong urings of the JS HQ, the Air AHQ issued orders to their commanders to restrict the war efforts, knowing that \"cross-border attacks either on the side of the LoC or the international border would invite an immediate response from the Indian Air Force, possibly in the shape of a retaliatory strike against the home base of the intruding fighters–thus starting the first round.\".\n\nFurthermore, the aerial embargo placed by the United States in 1989–91 had badly affected the operational capabilities of the air force to carry out day-and-night combat missions. After much discussions, the F-16s were deployed but under the country's airspace and did not part in the war, although the aircraft began patrolling the Skardu air force base only to protect the base from any Indian Air Force incursion. After the aerial mission flew to support the Indian Army, the F-16s from the Northern Air Command were deployed for combat air patrol that began patrolling the Skardu Air Force Base only to protect the base from any Indian Air Force incursion.\n\nAt several meetings, ACM Mehdi had objected Gen. Musharraf's grand strategy when he pointed out the aftermath of \"Chengiz Khan\", a successful mission of PAF but it led the start of 1971 war which end up as a disaster for Pakistan. Therefore, Mehdi objected any direct confrontation mission but favoured the patrolling missions and remaining silent in support of other officers who gave vital criticism of Musharraf.\n\nIn the military and political circles, ACM () Mehdi's image was widely known to have an imposing personality, and a direct but strict attitude towards his principles. His retirement was eventually confirmed when a junior-most air force general was promoted take succeed him, leading to speculations that \"PQ Mehdi's rather straight-faced and forthright dealings with a somewhat junior-general Pervez Musharraf (although both graduated with same class) particularly during Kargil conflict was a good reason to believe that the general decided to appoint a not-very-senior air chief marshal whom he could order around like one of his Corps Commanders.\".\n\nTherefore, General Musharraf favoured to superseded five senior air force generals and appointed a sixth-in-line to the four-star rank once Mehdi was due for retirement. However this perception was proved wrong by a new chief of air staff who was as solid as his predecessor and gave no quarter when it came to PAF's interests.\n\n"}

{"id": "158604", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158604", "title": "Shrove Tuesday", "text": "Shrove Tuesday\n\nShrove Tuesday (also known in Commonwealth countries and Ireland as Pancake Tuesday or Pancake day) is the day in February or March immediately preceding Ash Wednesday (the first day of Lent), which is celebrated in some countries by consuming pancakes. In others, especially those where it is called Mardi Gras or some translation thereof, this is a carnival day, and also the last day of \"fat eating\" or \"gorging\" before the fasting period of Lent.\n\nThis moveable feast is determined by Easter. The expression \"Shrove Tuesday\" comes from the word \"shrive\", meaning \"absolve\". Shrove Tuesday is observed by many Christians, including Anglicans, Lutherans, Methodists and Roman Catholics, who \"make a special point of self-examination, of considering what wrongs they need to repent, and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God's help in dealing with.\"\n\nBeing the last day of the liturgical season historically known as Shrovetide, before the penitential season of Lent, related popular practices, such as indulging in food that one sacrifices for the upcoming forty days, are associated with Shrove Tuesday celebrations, before commencing the fasting and religious obligations associated with Lent. The term \"Mardi Gras\" is French for \"Fat Tuesday\", referring to the practice of the last night of eating richer, fatty foods before the ritual fasting of the Lenten season, which begins on Ash Wednesday.\n\nThe tradition of marking the start of Lent has been documented for centuries. Ælfric of Eynsham's \"Ecclesiastical Institutes\" from around 1000 AD states: \"In the week immediately before Lent everyone shall go to his confessor and confess his deeds and the confessor shall so shrive him as he then may hear by his deeds what he is to do [in the way of penance]\". By the time of the late Middle Ages, the celebration of Shrovetide lasted until the start of Lent. Pancakes are commonly eaten on this day. Since foods such as butter, eggs and fat are discouraged from being eaten during the Lenten season, Christians use these ingredients during Shrovetide to make pancakes or other rich foods, such as fasnachts and pączkis. The specific custom of Christians eating pancakes on Shrove Tuesday dates to the 16th century. Along with its emphasis on feasting, another theme of Shrove Tuesday involves Christians repenting of their sins in preparation to begin the season of Lent in the Christian calendar. In many Christian parish churches, both Protestant and Roman Catholic, a popular Shrove Tuesday tradition is the ringing of the church bells (on this day, the toll is known as the Shriving Bell) \"to call the faithful to confession before the solemn season of Lent\" and for people to \"begin frying their pancakes\".\n\nThe word \"shrove\" is a form of the English word \"shrive\", which means to obtain absolution for one's sins by way of Confession and doing penance. Thus Shrove Tuesday gets its name from the custom for Christians to be \"shriven\" before the start of Lent.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Ireland and parts of the Commonwealth, Shrove Tuesday is also known as \"Pancake Day\" as it is a common custom to eat pancakes as a meal. Elsewhere, the day has also been called \"Fat Tuesday\" or \"Mardi Gras\".\n\nIn Germany, the day is known as Fastnachtsdienstag, Faschingsdienstag, Karnevalsdienstag or Veilchendienstag (the last of which translates to violet [the flower] Tuesday), and celebrated with fancy dress and partial school holiday. Similarly, in German American areas such as Pennsylvania Dutch Country, it is known as Fastnacht Day.\n\nIn the Netherlands, it is known as \"vastenavond\", or in Limburgish dialect \"vastelaovond\", though the word \"vastelaovond\" usually refers to the entire period of carnival in the Netherlands. In some parts of Switzerland (e.g. Lucerne), the day is called Güdisdienstag, preceded by Güdismontag. According to the Duden dictionary, the term derives from \"Güdel\", which means a fat stomach full of food Güdeldienstag.\n\nIn Portuguese-, Spanish- and Italian-speaking countries, among others, it is known as Carnival (to use the English spelling). This derives from Medieval Latin \"carnelevamen\" (\"the putting away of flesh\") and thus to another aspect of the Lenten fast. It is often celebrated with street processions or fancy dress. The most famous of these events is the Brazilian Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, while the Venetians celebrate carnival with a masquerade. The use of the term \"carnival\" in other contexts derives from here. In Spain, the Carnival Tuesday is named \"día de la tortilla\" (\"omelette day\"): an omelette made with some sausage or pork fat is eaten. On the Portuguese island of Madeira, they eat \"malasadas\" on Terça-feira Gorda (Fat Tuesday in English) which is also the last day of the Carnival of Madeira. Malasadas were cooked in order to use up all the lard and sugar in the house, in preparation for Lent. This tradition was taken to Hawaii, where Shrove Tuesday is known as Malasada Day, which dates back to the days of the sugar plantations of the 1800s, the resident Catholic Portuguese (mostly from Madeira and the Azores) workers used up butter and sugar prior to Lent by making large batches of \"malasadas\".\n\nIn Denmark and Norway, the day is known as \"Fastelavn\" and is marked by eating \"fastelavnsboller\". Fastelavn is the name for Carnival in Denmark which is either the Sunday or Monday before Ash Wednesday. Fastelavn developed from the Roman Catholic tradition of celebrating in the days before Lent, but after Denmark became a Protestant nation, the holiday became less specifically religious. This holiday occurs seven weeks before Easter Sunday, with children dressing up in costumes and gathering treats for the Fastelavn feast. The holiday is generally considered to be a time for children's fun and family games.\n\nIn Iceland, the day is known as \"Sprengidagur\" (Bursting Day) and is marked by eating salted meat and peas. In Lithuania, the day is called \"Užgavėnės\". People eat pancakes (\"blynai\") and Lithuanian-style doughnuts. In Sweden, the day is called Fettisdagen (Fat Tuesday), and is generally celebrated by eating a type of pastry called \"fastlagsbulle\" or \"semla\". In Finland, the day is called laskiainen and is generally celebrated by eating green pea soup and a pastry called laskiaispulla (sweet bread filled with whipped cream and jam or almond paste, same as the Swedish semla). The celebration often includes downhill sledging. In Estonia, the day is called Vastlapäev and is generally celebrated by eating pea soup and whipped-cream or whipped-cream and jam filled sweet-buns called \"vastlakukkel\", similar to the Swedish \"fastlagsbulle\" or \"semla\". Children also typically go sledding on this day.\n\nIn Poland, a related celebration falls on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday and is called (Fat Thursday). In some areas of the United States, with large Polish communities, such as Chicago, Buffalo and Michigan, Tłusty Czwartek is celebrated with or eating contests, music and other Polish food. It may be held on Shrove Tuesday or in the days immediately preceding it.\n\nIn Slovenia, Kurentovanje is also the biggest and best known carnival. There are several more local carnivals usually referred to as Laufarija. In Hungary, and the Hungarian-speaking territories, it is called (literally the Tuesday leaving the meat) and is celebrated by fancy dress and visiting neighbours.\n\nPancakes are associated with the day preceding Lent, because they are a way to use up rich foods such as eggs, milk, and sugar, before the fasting season of the 40 days of Lent. The liturgical fasting emphasizes eating simpler food, and refraining from food that would give undue pleasure: in many cultures, this means no meat, dairy products, or eggs.\n\nIn Newfoundland and Cape Breton Island small tokens are frequently cooked in the pancakes. Children take delight in discovering the objects, which are intended to be divinatory. For example, the person who receives a coin will be wealthy; a nail indicates that they will become or marry a carpenter.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, as part of community celebration, many towns held traditional Shrove Tuesday \"mob football\" games, some dating as far back as the 17th century. The practice mostly died out in the 19th century after the passing of the Highway Act 1835 which banned playing football on public highways. A number of towns have maintained the tradition, including Alnwick in Northumberland (Scoring the Hales), Ashbourne in Derbyshire (called the Royal Shrovetide Football), Atherstone in Warwickshire (called simply the Atherstone Ball Game), St Columb Major in Cornwall (called Hurling the Silver Ball), and Sedgefield in County Durham.\n\nShrove Tuesday was once known as a \"half-holiday\" in Britain. It started at 11:00am with the ringing of a church bell. On Pancake Day, \"pancake races\" are held in villages and towns across the United Kingdom. The tradition is said to have originated in 1445 when a housewife from Olney, Buckinghamshire, was so busy making pancakes that she forgot the time until she heard the church bells ringing for the service. She raced out of the house to church while still carrying her frying pan and pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning. The pancake race remains a relatively common festive tradition in the UK, especially England. Participants with frying pans race through the streets tossing pancakes into the air and catching them in the pan while running. The pancake race at Olney traditionally has women contestants who carry a frying pan and race over a 415-yard course to the finishing line. The rules are strict: contestants must toss the pancake at the start and the finish, and wear a scarf and apron.\n\nSince 1950 the people of Liberal and Olney, both in Kansas, US, have held the \"International Pancake Day\" race between the two towns. The two towns' competitors race along an agreed-upon measured course. The times of the two towns' competitors are compared to determine a winner overall. After the 2009 race, Liberal was leading with 34 wins to Olney's 25. A similar race is held in North Somercotes in Lincolnshire, England.\n\nScarborough celebrates by closing the foreshore to all traffic, closing schools early, and inviting all to skip. Traditionally, long ropes were used from the nearby harbour. The town crier rang the pancake bell, situated on the corner of Westborough (main street) and Huntriss Row. Since 1996 a replica \"pancake bell\" situated at Newborough and North Street has been rung to initiate the day's festivities.\n\nThe children of the hamlet of Whitechapel, Lancashire keep alive a local tradition by visiting local households and asking \"please a pancake\", to be rewarded with oranges or sweets. It is thought the tradition arose when farm workers visited the wealthier farm and manor owners to ask for pancakes or pancake fillings.\n\nIn Scandinavia, in particular in Finland and Sweden, the day is associated with the almond paste-filled semla pastry.\n\nThin pancakes called blini are traditional in Christian festivals in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia also at this time of year (Maslenitsa).\n\nIn London, the Rehab Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the Fourth Estate, contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of Rehab, which provides a range of health and social care, training, education, and employment services in the UK for disabled people and others who are marginalised.\n\nShrove Tuesday is exactly 47 days before Easter Sunday, a moveable feast based on the cycles of the moon. The date can be any between 3 February and 9 March inclusive.\n\nShrove Tuesday occurs on these dates:\n\n"}
{"id": "29218703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29218703", "title": "Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome", "text": "Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome\n\nSudden arrhythmic death syndrome (SADS), also known as sudden adult death syndrome, sudden unexpected/unexplained death syndrome (SUDS), sudden unexpected/unexplained nocturnal death syndrome (SUNDS), is a sudden unexpected death of adolescents and adults, mainly during sleep. One relatively common type is known as Brugada syndrome.\n\nSudden unexpected death syndrome is rare in most areas around the world. This syndrome occurs in populations that are culturally and genetically distinct, and people who leave the population carry with them the vulnerability to suddenly die during sleep. Sudden unexplained death syndrome was first noted in 1977 among southeast Asian Hmong refugees in the US. The disease was again noted in Singapore, when a retrospective survey of records showed that 230 otherwise healthy Thai men died suddenly of unexplained causes between 1982 and 1990.\n\nA sudden death in a young person can be caused by heart disease (including cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, myocarditis, genetic connective tissue disorders, or conduction disease), medication-related causes or other causes. Rare diseases called channelopathies may play a role such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), PCCD (progressive cardiac conduction defect), early repolarisation syndrome, mixed sodium channel disease, and short QT syndrome. No cause of death is found, even after extensive examination in 5% of cases.\n\nMedical examiners have taken into account various factors, such as nutrition, toxicology, heart disease, metabolism, and genetics. Although there is no real known definite cause, extensive research showed people 18 years or older were found to have suffered from a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a condition in which the heart muscle becomes oddly thickened without any obvious cause. This was the most commonly identified abnormality in sudden death of young adults. In the instances where people experience sudden death, it is most commonly found that they were suffering from CAD (coronary artery disease) or ASCAD (atherosclerotic coronary artery disease), or any level of stress. However, studies reveal that people experienced early symptoms within the week before the terminal event such as chest pain at ~52% of victims, dyspnea at ~22%, syncope at ~7% and ~19% who experienced no symptoms. Scientists have also associated this syndrome with the gene SCN5A that is mutated and affects the function of the heart. However, all autopsies done on victims who suffered from this syndrome came back negative.\n\nIn Thailand, Laos, and the Philippines, \"bangungot\" (or in their term, sudden adult death syndrome) is caused by the Brugada syndrome.\n\nDiagnosis usually occurs post-mortem.\n\nThe only proven way to prevent SADS is with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Oral antiarrhythmics such as propranolol are ineffective.\n\nIn 1980 a reported pattern of sudden deaths brought attention to the Centers for Disease Control. The first reported sudden death occurred in 1948 when there were 81 series of similar deaths of Filipino men in Oahu County, Hawaii. However, it did not become relevant because there was no pattern associated. This syndrome continued to become more significant as years went on. By the year of 1981-1982, the annual rate in the United States was high with 92/100,000 among Laotians-Hmong, 82/100,000 among other Laotian ethnic groups, and 59/100,000 among Cambodians. This elevated rate is why the pattern of Asian sudden unexpected deaths was brought to attention in the United States.\n\nSoutheast Asian immigrants, who were mostly fleeing the Vietnam War, most often had this syndrome, marking Southeast Asia as the area containing the most people with this fatal syndrome. However, there are other Asian populations that were affected, such as Filipinos and Chinese immigrants in the Philippines, Japanese in Japan, and natives of Guam in the United States and Guam. Nonetheless, these particular immigrants who had this syndrome were about 33 years old and seemingly healthy and all but one of the Laotian Hmong refugees were men. The condition appears to affect primarily young Hmong men from Laos (median age 33) and northeastern Thailand (where the population are mainly of Laotian descent).\n\nLaotian Hmongs were chosen for the study because they had one of the highest sudden death rates while sleeping in the United States. They were originally from Southern China and the highlands of North Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. The location that was picked for this study was in Ban Vinai in the Loei Province, which is approximately 15 kilometers from the Lao border. This study took place between October 1982 and June 1983 as this syndrome became more of a relevant pressing issue. Ban Vinai was the location chosen because it had 33,000 refugees in 1982, which was the largest population of victims. Because this syndrome was occurring most commonly in those particular men, researchers found it most beneficial and effective to study the population in which they migrated from instead of studying victims and populations in the U.S. Because of religious limitations the Hmong men in Ban Vinai were not allowed to receive autopsies. Therefore, the only results and research obtained were victims outside of their religion or geographical area. An interview was arranged with the next of kin who lived with the victim, witnessed the death, or found the body. The interviews were open ended and allowed the person who was next of kin to describe what they witnessed and what preceding events they thought were relevant to the victim's death. The interviewers also collected information such as illness history, the circumstances of the death, demographic background, and history of any sleep disturbances. A genealogy was then created which included all the relatives and their vital status and circumstances of death.\n\nIn a medical journal, the author suggested that the Hmong who died were killed by their own beliefs in the spiritual world, otherwise known as \"Nocturnal pressing spirit attacks\". In Indonesia it is called \"digeuton\", which translates to \"pressed on\" in English. In China it is called \"bèi guǐ yā\" () which translates to \"crushed by a ghost\" in English. The Dutch call the presence a \"nachtmerrie\", the night-mare. The \"merrie\" comes from the Middle Dutch \"mare\", an incubus who \"lies on people's chests, suffocating them\". This phenomenon is known among the Hmong people of Laos, who ascribe these deaths to a malign spirit, \"dab tsuam\" (pronounced \"da cho\"), said to take the form of a jealous woman.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, when an outbreak of this syndrome began, many of the Southeast Asians were not able to worship properly due to the guerrilla war against the government of Laos with the United States. Hmong people believe that when they do not worship properly, do not perform religious ritual properly or forget to sacrifice, the ancestor spirits or the village spirits do not protect them, thus allowing the evil spirit to reach them. These attacks induce a nightmare that leads to sleep paralysis when the victim is conscious and experiencing pressure on the chest. It is also common to have a REM state that is out of sequence where there is a mix of brain states that are normally held separate. After the war, the United States government scattered the Hmong across the country to 53 different cities. Once these nightmare visitations began, a shaman was recommended for psychic protection from the spirits of their sleep. However, scattered across 53 different cities, these victims had no access to any or the right shaman to protect them from this syndrome.\n\nHmong people believed that rejecting the role of becoming a shaman, they are taken into the spirit world.\n\n\"Bangungot\" is depicted in the Philippines as a mythological creature called \"batibat\" or \"bangungot\". This hag-like creature sits on the victim's face or chest so as to immobilize and suffocate him. When this occurs, the victim usually experiences paralysis.\n\n"}

The theater, dedicated to the playwright Carlo Goldoni, has a main facade on the narrow Via Santa Maria #15, it is near the corner with Via de Caldaie. \nThe monastery took its name from Annalena Malatesta, the wife of Baldaccio d'Anghiari, a 15th-century condottiero, known to Dante, who was killed by treachery by a rival at the Palazzo Vecchio. Annalena after the subsequent death of her only son, converted her house into a convent. Within this convent, both the father of Cosimo I and Tommaso Soderini are said to have found temporary asylum from proscription.\n\nIn the early 19th-century, the monastery was vacated and the property expropriated. The theater producer Luigi Gargani obtained the property, and commissioned the design from architect Giuseppe del Rosso. On opening, the theater had 80 booths and sat 1600 spectators.\n\nThe theater was restored and reopened in 1997.\n\nNearby on Via della Fornace, Gargani had Del Rosso design a \"Teatro Diurno\" or \"Teatro L'Arena\", for daytime performances. This theater was sited where the Bilioni family once had a house. In 1356, this site was made into a monastery, under the Augustinian of San Giovanni Battista and Santa Chiara. The monastery was suppressed and converted to a theater in the Spring of 1818. It could house 1500 spectators in seven ground rows and two upper floors. In 1819, the church at the site became a school, and later the studio of the 19th-century sculptor Francesco Pozzi.\n"}
{"id": "2109960", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2109960", "title": "The Alexandra, Birmingham", "text": "The Alexandra, Birmingham\n\nThe Alexandra, commonly known as the Alex, is a theatre on Suffolk Queensway in Birmingham, England.\n\nConstruction of the theatre commenced in 1900 and was completed in 1901. The architects were Owen & Ward and the theatre was opened on 27 May 1901 as the \"Lyceum Theatre\" on John Bright Street. Initially it attracted few theatre goers and it was decided to bring in a star. For ten weeks from the middle of June 1901 H. A. Saintsbury trod the boards as the theatre's leading man, playing in costume dramas.\n\nAs a result of disappointingly low returns the new theatre was sold to Lester Collingwood for £4,000, who renamed it the \"Alexandra Theatre\" on 22 December 1902. Collingwood was killed in a road traffic accident in 1910 and was succeeded by Leon Salberg, who died in his office at the theatre in 1938. His ghost is said to inhabit the theatre. Other ghostly sightings include that by a cleaner of a woman dressed in grey in 1987.\n\nThe theatre was rebuilt with a fine Art Deco auditorium in 1935 to a design by Roland Satchwell. Upon Leon Salberg's death, Derek Salberg took over the running of the theatre. The Salberg family ran the theatre from 1911 to 1977. Following World War II, the theatre became well patronised by the local population - in 1950 85% of season ticket holders lived within the boundaries of Birmingham.\n\nAlthough the main entrance was originally situated on John Bright Street, a new main entrance block was built on Suffolk Street between 1967-1969 to a design by the John Madin Design Group, with a wide bridge linking the two - from the inside, the appearance is that of a single building. Satchwell's interior was refurbished in 1992 by the Seymour Harris Partnership. The Alex was sold to Apollo Leisure in the 1990s. Derek Salberg's autobiography \"\"Much Ado About Theatre\" had its foreword written by Laurence Olivier. Under Leon Salberg, the Alex was famous for its pantomimes such as \"Mother Goose\"\".\n\nThe theatre currently seats 1,371 and hosts a busy programme of touring drama, West End shows and stand-up comedy. It was the home of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company between 1990 and 1997.\n\nNeville Chamberlain delivered a speech at the theatre on 13 October 1918.\n\n\"Dad's Army\" star Arthur Lowe collapsed because of a stroke in his dressing room in the theatre before a performance of \"Home at Seven\", and later died in hospital on 15 April 1982 aged 66.\n\nOn 7 August 1995, the then Alexandra Theatre was taken over by the multi-national organisation the Apollo Leisure Group. The new owners who ran many West End theatres brought many large scale West End productions to the Alex including \"Copacabana\", \"Great Expectations\", \"Grease\" and \"Summer Holiday\" starring Darren Day. A critically acclaimed production of \"West Side Story\" transferred to the West End for a successful run.\n\nUnder the ownership of Apollo Leisure, the Alex saw major investment including improvements to the stage area and front of house areas, this then enabled the theatre to stage first-rate productions including two productions from Cameron Mackintosh, \"Oliver!\" starring Gary Wilmot, and \"Les Misérables\" - the first productions to try out the new facilities.\n\nIn 1999 the Apollo Leisure Group was bought by American entertainment company SFX Entertainment for around £160 million. Under SFX management the theatre saw increased entertainment value, still welcoming West End productions such as \"Doctor Dolittle\", and in Christmas 2000 saw the return of pantomime to the theatre, with a sell out season of \"Peter Pan\" starring Leslie Grantham and Joe Pasquale. \nIn 2001, SFX merged with Clear Channel Entertainment, making them the largest UK theatre operator, including three West End theatres. Under the ownership of Clear Channel the theatre continued to provide and attract a range of entertainment, including musicals, comedy, plays, opera and concerts.\n\nComedians including Stewart Lee, Seann Walsh, Jack Dee and Micky Flanagan have all performed at the theatre in recent years.\n\nIn January 2006 the Alexandra Theatre changed management once again, to be managed by Live Nation, a company that specialised in concert promotion and large venue operations. It is now owned by the Ambassador Theatre Group, and after a minor refurbishment the group renamed the theatre the \"New Alexandra Theatre\".\n\nOn 17 September 2018, the theatre was relaunched as \"The Alexandra\" following a £650,000 refurbishment and corporate re-brand to the venue which will be unveiled in October 2018 for the opening of the UK tour.\n\n"}

The project is based around an album of covers of songs by Dogs D'Amour, recorded by fans of the band, and the name of the project was taken from the first line of the Dogs song ‘’“The Prettiest Girl In The World”’’.\n\nThe project was conceived by Bruce Cunnington. In 2001, inspired by an earlier Dogs D’Amour tribute album (1999, Bullet Proof Poems ) Bruce discussed with a small group of fans the idea of producing a “by the fans, for the fans” album of acoustic Dogs D’Amour covers, however the time and cost involved prevented this from becoming a reality. By early 2007, with the rise to prominence of the internet download as a method of releasing music, the idea resurfaced, this time with the added motivation that it would be a way of paying tribute to Trace Warnaby, a well-known and much-loved figure in rock fan circles, who had died in December 2006 and who also inspired the Mad As Badgers fundraising project for the same cause. Tyla, vocalist and songwriter of Dogs D’Amour, gave his blessing to the project, even re-recording one song himself under the alias of Gabriel O’Keefe.\n\nThe project was publicised mainly by the fans themselves, using the internet. Fans’ messageboards carried links to the Hearts website. The group became a visible presence on Myspace, with those involved actively posting bulletins and banners on their own pages to spread word of the project. A group was set up on Facebook, and Trig.com also featured a page for the Hearts project.\n\n\nIn August 2007, members of the Hearts team gathered at a studio just outside London to record their version of “How Do You Fall In Love Again?”. Those who had some musical talent played drums, guitar, and bass. Those with enthusiasm gathered for a group singalong of the chorus. Each member then recorded a solo lead vocal track. The song was then mixed by Jason Knight, and received its debut airing on the project’s Myspace page on 29 August 2007, with the promo video – filmed on the day of recording by Darren Stockford – being shown for the first time on 8 September 2007, also on the project’s Myspace page. While the original plan was for an internet-only release for the album, a limited edition CD was also released to increase the amount of money that could be raised through the project.\n\nThe project, fortunately and coincidentally, was in full swing when Tyla announced that he would be touring the UK at the end of 2007. The fundraising efforts were focussed on the Norwich date of the tour, which was organised and promoted by a member of the Hearts team. On earlier dates of the tour, raffle tickets were sold at the merchandise stand, the draw taking place at Norwich with the top prizes being a piece of original artwork, painted and donated by Tyla and, as the fundraising was all about raising money for Cancer Research, a mammogram at a Harley Street clinic. Other prizes include t-shirts and signed memorabilia, while several fans also donated items from their own record collections.\n\nThe August Bank Holiday weekend of 2008 saw an all-day fundraising concert take place in Brighton, once again with Cancer Research UK as the beneficiaries. The event, which was christened \"The Burning Hearts Brighton Bash\", featured several of the bands who had recorded tracks for the album and was headlined by The Gasoline Queens, who had made up part of the most recent Dogs D'Amour line-up. Fundraising activities on the day included a raffle and a BBQ, which saw members of the bands who appeared on the day cooking burgers and hot dogs for the fans who were present.\n\n\n"}

He took part in the 'Great Escape' from Stalag Luft III in March 1944, but was one of the men recaptured and subsequently executed by the Gestapo.\n\nKirby-Green was born in Dowa, Nyasaland where his father Sir William Kirby-Green was the British District Governor. His father was upcountry at the time of his birth and found a baby abandoned in the bush at the same time as his son was born. He rescued the child, named him \"Putti\" and brought him up as a second son. After growing up in Africa, Kirby-Green was sent to boarding school in England at Dover College where he became a house prefect and a member of the rugby team. On leaving school in 1935 he lived with his parents in Tangier and gained a private pilot's license prior to joining the Royal Air Force. Kirby-Green was commissioned on 24 August 1936, he trained as a service pilot at No. 8 Flying Training School Montrose and joined No. 216 Squadron RAF flying transport aircraft in Egypt from 27 May 1937 before being confirmed as a pilot officer on 29 June 1937. During this period he regularly sailed to Tangier to visit his parents whilst on leave.\n\nIn January 1938 he was transferred to No. 99 Squadron RAF at RAF Mildenhall and with the squadron converted to the new Vickers Wellington bomber later that year. During 1938 he competed in the RAF Athletics Championships representing the base and competing against Ian Cross representing RAF Marham neither knowing that they would both be involved in the \"Great Escape\" in 1944. He was promoted flying officer on 29 January 1939. \nIn January 1940, after completing a gunnery course, he joined No. 9 Squadron RAF to fly Vickers Wellingtons operationally from RAF Honington and by the end of July 1940 he had completed 27 operations. That September he was rested and posted to the newly formed No. 311 Squadron RAF a Czech squadron, as a flight instructor. He always wore Czech insignia on his RAF uniform to honour his Czech friends. Kirby-Green was promoted flight lieutenant on 3 September 1940. Near the end of 1940 he married Maria Dorothea Diane Hayman in south-west London and they set up home at Hamerton near Huntingdon. In September 1941 he completed a highly successful instructional tour with the Czechs being posted away to No. 40 Squadron RAF for a second tour of ops. His commanding officer was \"Pick\" Pickard DSO DFC. On 10 September 1941 he participated in a bombing attack on Turin, Italy and was the only pilot of the squadron to reach and bomb the target due to the terrible weather conditions. He was promoted acting squadron leader and flight commander and received a Mention in Despatches.\n\nAt 01:06 hours on the morning of 17 October 1941 he took off from RAF Alconbury on his 37th operation flying a Wellington Mark Ic bomber (serial number \"Z8862\", squadron codes BL-B) to bomb factories in Duisburg but Kirby-Green's aircraft was shot down. All of the rest of the crew were killed and Kirby-Green became a prisoner of war. Percy Pickard flew down to break the news to his wife and said that he was sure that Kirby-Green would be a prisoner of war and then on 16 November 1941 William Joyce, Lord Haw Haw the American born Irish-British Nazi collaborator broadcasting from Berlin made specific reference to the capture of Squadron Leader Kirby-Green. By this time he had passed through interrogation camp at Dulag Luft and was in Stalag Luft I at Barth where he was a colourful and noisy character.\nAs a prisoner of war Kirby-Green received exotic parcels from family in Tangier with fruits, nuts, gramophone records of Latin music and bright clothing. He and Johnny Stower gave classes teaching the Spanish language. After transfer to Stalag Luft III he became more closely associated with Roger Bushell who was Big-X running the escape activities. Bushell recruited him as the senior security officer for the escape committee. He became Big-S and introduced a \"duty-pilot\" scheme which involved maintaining a watch on all German activities. He was also an enthusiastic tunneller, and collated all available information on Spain, anything which might assist an escaper heading for that frontier.\n\nThe original escape plan teamed Gordon Kidder up with Dick Churchill to travel posing as Rumanian woodcutters, but after Churchill was removed to another camp, Kidder was paired with deeply sun-tanned Tom Kirby-Green, who had been in charge of security for organizer Roger Bushells \"escape committee\"; they would instead pose as Spanish labourers. Despite Kirby-Green being buried by a cave-in in the tunnel, he and Kidder were amongst the first 24 from the total of 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24–25 March 1944, in the escape now known as \"the Great Escape\". The pair cleared the tunnel exit before the alarm was sounded and made it to the local railway station, where they were almost exposed when questioned by a female member of the prison camp censor staff. She involved a policeman, who was convinced by their mixture of Spanish and broken German and let them go. \nThey boarded the train for Breslau, where they then changed trains for Czechoslovakia, hoping for a further connection to Yugoslavia or Hungary where Kirby-Green had friends. But after crossing the border they were recaptured at Hodonin in southern Moravia (close to the Austrian frontier) on 28 March 1944. While held at Zlin prison they were the only prisoners interrogated physically and violently.\nThe two escapers were taken away by the Zlin Gestapo in two cars which headed out onto the Breslau road, and shot near Mahrisch Ostrau (later known as Moravska Ostrava and now just as Ostrava), their bodies being cremated in the local crematorium there. Urns returned to Stalag Luft III were marked with the date 29 March 1944 and the name of the town Mahrisch.\n\nKirby-Green was one of the 50 escapers executed and murdered by the \"Gestapo\". Originally his remains were buried at Sagan. He is now buried in part of the Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery.\n\nPost-war Czech investigators identified the participants in the murders of Kirby-Green and Gordon Kidder at Hrabuvka, west of Ostrava, and notified their British opposite numbers on 2 December 1945.\n\nKirby-Green's name was amongst those in the list of murdered prisoners which was published when news broke on or about 19–20 May 1944. The Glasgow Herald of 19 May 1944 published an early list naming several officers including Kirby-Green. Post-war investigations saw a number of those guilty of the murders tracked down, arrested and tried for their crimes.\n\n\n\n"}

Due to the severe time constraints, and because the Festival required only the submission of a script plus four songs, Bowen wrote most lyrics without any accompanying melody, planning to finish the songs later. Nevertheless, many of these lyrics have remained intact through several incarnations and revisions to the show.\n\nBowen and Bell, determined to write an original musical rather than adapt an existing play or movie, discovered almost immediately that their conversations about what to write were more interesting than what they were actually writing. As the idea to document the creation of the show itself (\"a musical about two guys writing a musical about two guys writing a musical\") became clearer, Bell and Bowen expanded the script based on their writing experiences with friends Susan Blackwell and Heidi Blickenstaff. \"[title of show]\" has since become a post-modern work-in-progress, with updates and changes to each new production reflecting the circumstances the cast and the show have experienced. Larry Pressgrove is the musical director and orchestrator in all productions to date.\n\nThe first three performances of \"[title of show]\", at the Manhattan Theatre Source in the summer of 2004, were produced by Laura Camien. The cast included Bowen, Bell, Blackwell, and Stacia Fernandez, playing the role of \"Stacia\". Bowen and Bell convinced several Broadway stars to participate in a recurring plot device by leaving recorded phone messages rejecting offers to star in the show. Messages featured in the Theatre Source and Festival performances included Idina Menzel, Marin Mazzie, Sutton Foster and Emily Skinner.\n\nThe production premiered at the 2004 New York Musical Theatre Festival on September 22, 2004 (also produced by Camien), at the Belt Theatre, and ran for six performances as scheduled. Heidi Blickenstaff replaced Fernandez, who had accepted the understudy role to Beth Leavel in the Broadway production of \"The Drowsy Chaperone.\" While her character's name remained \"Stacia\" for the Festival performances, thereafter it became \"Heidi\", and the role was modified to reflect Blickenstaff's experiences while helping to expand and evolve the show.\n\nA year of expansion and revision followed. Kevin McCollum agreed to produce \"[title of show]\" for professional presentation after seeing it performed at the Festival. Five new songs were added: \"Monkeys and Playbills\", \"What Kind of Girl is She?\", \"Festival Medley/September Song\", \"Secondary Characters\" and \"Nine People's Favorite Thing\". \"The Wall\", originally sung by Jeff and Stacia at the Festival, was rewritten as a solo for Heidi with new lyrics, and a new name, \"A Way Back to Then.\" Changes to the book included the addition of the conflict between Susan and Heidi (as introduced by \"What Kind of Girl Is She?\") and the combined music and scenes \"Awkward Photo Shoot\" and \"Change It, Don't Change It.\" Both reflected the tension among the cast members that had begun to set in since the Festival's performance and their uncertainty about an off-Broadway run.\n\nAfter several performances at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center in Waterford, CT, six off-off Broadway performances were staged at Ars Nova in New York City in September 2005. Phone messages in the Ars Nova production were left by Marin Mazzie and Emily Skinner again, with new messages from Amy Spanger and Victoria Clark. The success of these performances led to an offer by the Vineyard Theatre of a limited off-Broadway run.\n\n\"[title of show]\" was performed at the Vineyard Theatre from February 26, 2006 to April 24, 2006 as part of the theatre's regular season line-up, followed by an extension of the production from July 14, 2006 through October 1, 2006. Christine Ebersole lent her voice to one of the phone messages. The production won three Obie Award Special Citations for its writer/stars and director.\n\nA performance was scheduled to play in San Francisco in 2008 but was canceled because of time constraints in moving the show to Broadway by July 2008. The show's transfer to Broadway is chronicled in \"the \"[title of show]\" show\" video blogs on YouTube and on the show's official web site.\n\nThe musical began previews on Broadway at the Lyceum Theatre on July 5, 2008 and officially opened on July 17. It closed October 12, 2008 after 13 previews and 102 performances. It was produced by McCollum, Roy Miller (producer of \"The Drowsy Chaperone\"), The Vineyard Theatre, Laura Camien and Kris Stewart, the founder of the New York Musical Theatre Festival.\n\nThe entire off-Broadway cast continued in the same roles, and Berresse continued as director. Added to the list of phone messages in the Broadway production was the voice of Patti LuPone. Scenic design was by Neil Patel, costumes by Chase Tyler and lighting by Ken Billington and Jason Kantrowitz. \nThe show won a 2009 Broadway.com Audience Award for Favorite Ensemble Cast.\n\nThe London premiere opened at the Landor Theatre in August, 2013 starring Scott Garnham as Hunter, Simon Bailey as Jeff, Sarah Galbraith as Susan and Sophia Ragavelas as Heidi.\n\nSeveral regional productions have been staged, starting in January 2010 in St. Louis, Missouri. The Los Angeles premiere production ran from July 16, 2010 to September 11, 2010, at the Celebration Theatre with Jennifer R. Blake, Carey Peters, Jeffrey Landman, Micah McCain, and Gregory Nabours, for which Jennifer R. Blake won Outstanding Performance by a Lead Actress in a Musical for the role of Susan from StagesceneLA's Best of LA Theatre Awards 2009-2010 A production ran from November 16, 2010 to December 12, 2010 at the George Street Playhouse, New Brunswick, New Jersey, with Seth Rudetsky, Tyler Maynard, Lauren Kennedy and Susan Mosher. A production by Forte Musical Theatre Guild in Calgary ran from May 24 to June 4, 2011, directed by: Glenda Stirling\n\nThe Interlochen Arts Academy presented the musical in October 2012. With the help of two of the show's creators, Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell, an expanded ensemble was added to the production. This production was toured to New York for a weekend run at the Helen Mills Theater. A Danish production opened January 31, 2013 in Fredericia, 200 km west of Copenhagen. It was directed by Victoria Bussert and stars Lars Mølsted as Henrik (Hunter], Thomas Jensen as Jeff, Bjørg Gamst as Heidi, Maria Skuladottir as Susan and Thomas Møller as Lars (Larry). Danish translation by Thomas Bay and Mads Nielsen. The show was first seen at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2013, starring Carley Stenson as Susan, Robbie Towns as Jeff, Ricky Johnston as Hunter, and Jamie Lee Pike as Heidi. Other foreign productions include Hong Kong (2015). \nThe German-language premiere was presented at the Admiralspalast, Berlin in April 2017. The production starred Dennis Weißert (Hunter), Alexander Soehnle (Jeff), Annika Henz (Heidi), Franziska Kuropka (Susan) and Damian Omansen (Larry). The creative team included Damian Omansen (musical direction), Silvia Varelli (choreography and musical staging), Daniel Unger (design), Jonathan Richter (sound) and Martin Siemann (light). The German translation and stage direction was by Robin Kulisch.\n\nThe cast for the New York Musical Theatre Festival, off-Broadway, Broadway, and national tour productions has remained the same:\n\nLarry Pressgrove, the arranger and musical director, has a minor speaking role as himself (\"Larry\") while playing musical accompaniment at an on-stage keyboard.\n\nThe show also features recorded vocal cameo appearances by several well-known Broadway actors, playing themselves: Kerry Butler, Marin Mazzie, Victoria Clark, Christine Ebersole, Sutton Foster, Patti LuPone, and Emily Skinner.\n\nStandbys for the both the original off-Broadway and Broadway productions were Courtney Balan and Benjamin Howes.\n\nAs the show opens (\"Untitled Opening Number\") Jeff and Hunter are discussing the possibility of entering the upcoming New York Musical Theatre Festival. The submissions deadline is only three weeks away, but they long to make their mark in the theatre world (\"Two Nobodies In New York\"). Jeff laments his lack of inspiration. When his blank writing pad begins to look like Hunter, ideas begin to flow (\"An Original Musical\").\n\nThe two men recruit their friends Susan and Heidi to help with the project. As the guys battle writer's block, the girls become voices in their heads, making suggestions. \"Writing should feel easy,\" Susan says, \"like a monkey driving a speedboat\" (\"Monkeys and Playbills\"). Excitement mounts; if the show is a hit, they could replace the four ugly mismatched chairs on the set with chairs covered in diamonds. Hunter even ponders winning a Tony (\"The Tony Award Song\")—but Jeff reminds him that they have already cut the song he is in the midst of singing. Jeff and Hunter discuss their ambition to write and compose for a living (\"Part of It All\").\n\nDoubts and insecurities surface. Heidi wonders what she has gotten herself into, and Hunter worries that they are just stringing sketches and novelty songs together, that they need something \"a little meatier\" (\"I Am Playing Me\"). Susan and Heidi become suspicious of each other (\"What Kind Of Girl Is She?\"). Hunter and Jeff are getting increasingly discouraged: What were they thinking? Will they even finish? Susan says the \"vampires\" are devouring their confidence and creativity, and they cannot let that happen (\"Die, Vampire, Die!\"). Reenergized, the men finish the show, and the ensemble tackles the festival paperwork (\"Filling Out The Form\"). Since the deadline is upon them and nobody can come up with a killer name for the show, they decide to leave the title-of-show field untouched—which makes \"[title of show]\" the name of their show. \"What if they don't pick it?\" Hunter worries. \"Well, that'll be Act 2,\" says Jeff.\n\nBut their little three-week-old musical is chosen. During the festival the four revel in their six performances, and lament that it all must end (\"September Song\"). They note, as a bonus, that \"fancy industry people\" are in the audience. Heidi and Susan reconcile their differences and bond over their supporting roles (\"Secondary Characters\").\n\nAs plans progress toward taking the musical to Broadway, things begin to unravel: The four friends argue over the wisdom of making changes to the script, or leaving it alone (\"Change It/Don't Change It\"). Hunter and Jeff, after contacting numerous famous Broadway actresses, finally get a positive response from Sutton Foster, and Hunter suggests casting her in Heidi's role to generate some \"buzz\". Tensions build, and everything finally boils over at a publicity photo shoot (\"Awkward Photo Shoot\"). Heidi is upset that Hunter wants to replace her, Susan is concerned about profit-sharing, Jeff is letting the \"vampires\" get to him again, Larry (the keyboardist) feels snubbed because he's not in any of the press photos, and Hunter lashes out at all of them. Everyone leaves in a huff.\n\nThat night, Hunter breaks the ice by apologizing. More apologies follow, and the four wax nostalgic over younger, happier, less complicated days (\"A Way Back To Then\"). They now understand that the show must sink or swim as it is—with the five of them, without a \"bankable\" star—because their relationship and the quality of their creation are more important to them than commercial success; they would rather be \"...nine people's favorite thing than a hundred people's ninth-favorite thing\" (\"Nine People's Favorite Thing\"). \"Let's just put it out there and see what happens,\" Jeff says—which, of course, they have just finished doing—so the show ends (\"Finale\").\n\nAt curtain call, the four ugly chairs rise into the rafters and return encrusted in diamonds.\n\n\nThe 2006 original Off-Broadway cast recording was released by Ghostlight Records, an imprint of Sh-K-Boom Records. It includes the same musical numbers listed above, except that only \"September Song\" is performed from the \"Montage\" parts, followed by \"Secondary Characters\" (sung by Heidi and Susan) instead of \"Change It, Don't Change It\" and \"Awkward Photo Shoot\", which are not on the cast recording.\n\nThere are two bonus tracks on the recording:\n\n\"The [title of show] show\" is a video blog by the creators of \"[title of show]\". It documents the musical's progress to Broadway. Guest actors Barrett Foa, Sean Palmer, Sierra Boggess, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Kerry Butler, Lea Michele, Gideon Glick, Jonathan Groff, Ann Harada, director of \"[title of show]\" Michael Berresse and Cheyenne Jackson appear on the \"[title of show] show\".\n\nThe titles of the show's episodes reflect the original cast recording track listing.\n\nJeff and Hunter, appearing largely in character, excitedly announce that \"[title of show]\" is going to Broadway. This episode sets the precedent for future episodes; Jeff wears his costume from the original off-Broadway production and Hunter wears a promotional shirt from a random Broadway show. The episode chronicles the creation of the \"[title of show]\" show and includes clips of Jeff composing the show's musical theme at the piano.\n\nSplit into two parts, Jeff and Hunter begin searching for a Broadway theatre and Jeff creates the [TOS]ability Board. Susan checks in from her dressing room on the set of \"Law & Order\", her first appearance on the show after performing an unprepared search for a theater on foot in Shubert Alley. Upon returning to the apartment, Heidi messages Hunter and Jeff on iChat and recommends that the group perform out of town before mounting a Broadway production.\n\nThis episode introduced the duct tape motif of \"[title of show]\" publicity and the first playing of the opening sequence Jeff began composing in Episode 1.\n\nThis episode begins in the tradition of the \"[title of show]\"'s self-aware nature and immediately exposes the back stage conversations of the actors after filming Episode 2.\n\nHunter and Jeff begin to wonder if people will understand what \"[title of show]\" is. Susan, who has apparently been in the room during the filming of Episode 2, has prepared a comedic video spoof of a 1980s instructional video that explains the show's concept. Larry Pressgrove appears for the first time as Constantine, a co-worker in Jim and Barry's office.\n\nThe instructional video is interrupted so Jeff can update the [TOS]ability Board. Also, Jeff introduces his \"[title of show]\" Showcial Network Chart which records the status of \"[title of show]\" on Broadwayworld.com's Showcial Network. Hunter introduces his own chart called \"Hunter's Chart of Jeff's Charts.\"\n\nHunter and Jeff begin perusing a gift bag from \"Broadway on Broadway\" and decide to attend the annual Broadway flea market. While Jeff shows his new Playbills to Susan, Heidi arrives at the apartment. After a quick joyous reunion, the group decides to hit the town \"Heidi-Style.\" During a montage of the day, Jeff updates the [TOS]ability Board. After a long day, Jeff, Hunter, Heidi and Susan relax and imagine how \"[title of show]\" could play in different US cities in a series of television show spoofs. Jeff is seen out of costume for the first time.\n\nIn the writers' room, Hunter, Jeff, Heidi, Susan and Larry sit around a table and discuss what Episode 5 will be about. As a running joke, every time the city \"[title of show]\" will play in is said, a sound effect blocks it out. The team decide that parodies are the best ways to create exposure for \"[title of show]\". The discussion is interrupted by Jeff who updates the Showcial Network Chart and by Hunter parodying the YouTube video Leave Britney Alone. Jeff interrupts his own sequence to update the [TOS]ability Board and is again interrupted by Hunter who parodies the YouTube video of Miss Teen South Carolina.\n\nHeidi enters the scene and accidentally mentions that the out of town trial will take place in San Francisco. Susan then confesses to the audience that because no arrangements have been finalized, the city the out of town tryout had not yet been revealed. This episode has brief cameos from actors Sean Palmer and Barrett Foa.\n\nHunter and Jeff consider that should \"[title of show]\" become a Broadway hit, they would need to cast replacements for the original cast upon on whom the characters in the show are based.\n\nA musical sequence begins in which many Broadway actors sing a refrain from the show. Several actors play Hunter and Jeff in brief sequences that interrupt the musical number. Jeff introduces his new chart, Jeff's Playbill Needs, which lists Playbills he needs for his collection. Hunter, played by Ann Harada interrupts to add this chart to Hunter's Chart of Jeff's Charts.\n\nThe episode includes a very brief closing cameo from Nathan Lane and David Hyde Pierce.\n\nAfter agreeing there should be no more cameos via telephone, Hunter and Jeff prepare to meet at a planned press conference. Hunter has the responsibility of telling Cheyenne Jackson that he is no longer in the show. Jackson, enraged, exits the room.\n\nHeidi and Susan begin a fake press conference that parodies the news crawl and logo of CNN. Jeff arrives late to the conference and announces there will be no pre-Broadway tryout and the show will be sent directly to Broadway.\n\nBack in the apartment, Jeff and Hunter draw attention to the fact that they have implied the out of town tryout would be in San Francisco, which was canceled due to timing issues. Jeff updates the [TOS]ability Board and notes that every Broadway theatre is booked for the season but they still hope to perform on Broadway in spring 2008. Due to copyright infringement, the sound was turned off by YouTube. It was re-uploaded on February 23, 2010 with sound. The video without sound is still on the show's channel.\n\nThis episode features no introduction although the show's theme is played at the beginning. It begins with the end credits from the end to the beginning. A baton relay race is held by the cast of \"[title of show]\" involving a mysterious package that has been delivered to Jeff. Over twenty minutes earlier, Susan hands the package to Jeff who runs through Times Square to the Lyceum Theatre or The Producing Office to view its contents. Over thirty minutes earlier, Mindy gives Susan the package who runs to give it to Jeff, but on the way is attacked by ninjas. After a fierce battle, Susan defeats them and finds that one is Spring Awakening star Jonathan Groff. After finding that Groff cannot get her tickets, she kills him and finishes her trip in a restaurant where she eats and forgets to give Jeff the package. Nearly 40 minutes earlier, Larry gives Mindy singing lessons for a back-up vocal part in \"Die, Vampire, Die\" when a dog, Olive, gives him the package which he immediately gives to Mindy for delivery. Mindy runs through New York where she collides with Cheyenne Jackson. Avoiding Jackson, Mindy delivers the package to Susan. One hour earlier, Heidi sits in her dressing room preparing for a performance of The Little Mermaid. Hunter arrives out of breath and gives Heidi the package which she ties onto Olive's collar. Olive runs down the sidewalk to Larry's apartment building where she meets John Tartaglia in the elevator. Not caring what Tartaglia has to say, Olive leaves the elevator and delivers the package to Larry. Thirty-five minutes earlier, Hunter sits at his breakfast table when he suddenly gets dressed and retrieves the package from a shoe-box in his kitchen. He runs into midtown New York City passing actor Barrett Foa on the way to Heidi's dressing room. Twenty minutes earlier, Hunter stretches outside his apartment building and brings in a newspaper. While reading the newspaper, Hunter sees that the \"New York Times\" has announced \"[title of show]\" is going to Broadway. He retrieves the shoe-box which is labeled \"in case of [broadway] open.\" The entire sequence of events is played forwards very quickly and Jeff opens the package which contains the \"[title of show]\" sticker for his [TOS]ability board. The cast gathers around to see that the show will be playing at the Lyceum Theatre beginning on July 5. The closing credits announce the dates and ticket availability for the Broadway production and asks the viewer to \"tell 9 people\" in a reference to the song \"Nine People's Favorite Thing.\" The episode was later re-uploaded, although the original video is still on their channel.\n\nJeff is working in his kitchen preparing for Broadway when Hunter calls him. They tease one another about their success. They discuss American Idol and realize they have yet to film a new episode of The \"[title of show]\" show. Hunter reminds Jeff that they have already agreed to produce thirteen episodes despite Jeff's criticisms.\n\nHunter and Jeff explain what the cast has been doing since the debut of Episode 8. The cast have been rehearsing, hosting the Drama Desk Awards and modeling in promotional photography sessions. Hunter jokes that the show has already won Tony Awards although it has not yet opened on Broadway. Jeff and Hunter then teleport to the Lyceum Theatre where the new marquee for the show is being hung over the street. Larry, Susan and Heidi are summoned to 45th street. When they try to enter the theater they realize they are locked out as the Broadway revival of Macbeth is still striking. The group returns to the apartment where they continue to plan for the upcoming Broadway production. They graciously thank their fans for their support over the past four years.\n\nThe cast talks about their experience on the \"Great White Way\". Many stars come and ask for Mindy... Mindy Gets Shot!\n\nThe show opens with Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell outside Mindy's hospital room. A doctor comes out and tells them that she has just emerged from a 5-month coma. The show becomes a holiday special, featuring many of the guests in Episode 10, including Cheyenne Jackson, who is here to \"finish the job\".\n\nThe show reveals that it was not Cheyenne Jackson who shot Mindy but Allison Janney. The Tony Award Season special begins. Jeff unveils a new chart of which musicals are eligible for Tony Awards.\n\nHunter, Susan, Heidi and Jeff reminisce and celebrate the Christmas spirit. This episode introduced the puppets Grampa and Mindy played by Paul McGinnis and Matt Vogel respectively. Further, Cheyenne Jackson makes his first of several appearances on the show. Rather than focusing on mounting \"[title of show]\" on Broadway, the show is a series of comedic skits and musical numbers. This includes the puppets getting drunk, references to old-fashioned Christmas specials and an original claymation. Hunter and Jeff thank the fans for their continuing support and wish their viewers a merry Christmas.\n\nThis episode begins with a series of telephone calls between Hunter and Jeff and explains what is termed the \"snakeeatstailness\" of \"[title of show]\", or how the show chronicles its own creation and encompasses a cyclical pattern explained as ouroboros, a Greek term for this pattern. The video links to additional videos on the \"[title of show]\" website and features guest actors.\n\nThe [title of show] show: Extra Testimonials are video reviews by viewers of \"[title of show]\"'s Broadway production.\n\nIn this music video, set to the song \"Nine People's Favorite Thing\" (from \"[title of show]\"), 600 fans were assigned one line each from the song through e-mail, and instructed to e-mail a picture of themselves illustrating the lyric. The final video contains every picture, in lyrical order, as the song plays. The fans include everyday people and celebrities Patti LuPone, Joel Grey, Betty Buckley, John Kander, Jonathan Groff, Neil Patrick Harris, Jane Krakowski, America Ferrera, actor/siblings Celia, Maggie, and Andrew Keenan-Bolger, and others.\n\n"}

{"id": "1959418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959418", "title": "Uppsala Reggae Festival", "text": "Uppsala Reggae Festival\n\nUppsala Reggae Festival is the largest reggae festival in Scandinavia. It has been active since 2001, with a number of notable artists performing. It was first held in 2001, but the name was used as early as 1995. Uppsala Reggae Festival attracts attendees of all ages from all over the world. In connection with the 2001 festival, Uppsala was given the epithet \"The Reggae Mecca of Scandinavia\" by the Swedish National TV4, on the grounds that the festival then was the only festival in Scandinavia specifically dedicated to reggae. The third Uppsala Reggae Festival was awarded that year's cultural award by Swedish National Radio Broadcasting, and the fourth festival featured the largest reggae lineup ever to play in Scandinavia. Starting in 2002, the festival was held in August each year in Uppsala, 70 km north of Stockholm until it relocated in 2012. In 2004, the festival settled down at its current venue, KAP, which is central and in the heart of the city. Both in 2004 and 2005, the festival had about 10,000 attendees. Moreover, in 2007, the festival had the most visitors recorded to date with approximately 24,000 patrons attending the festival.\n\nIn 2012, the festival moved to Gävle where it was held in 2012 and 2013. However, after a couple of years, the promoters decided to cancel the festival. \nAfter a six year long hiatus, where the festival had left a big void in the city of Uppsala, it was announced in December 2016 that the festival would be making a long-awaited comeback in 2017. It has been confirmed that the festival will be held at the same venue as prior years, with the biggest change being that it will only be one day, as opposed to the two or three days that had become the custom in the past.\n\nJimmy Cliff, Kaliffa, Sevana, Papa Dee, Soundkilla, Trinity Sound, Stereo Steppers, Kabaka Pyramid, Lila Iké, Diego Jah, Meditative Sounds, Lion Youths, Micah Shemaiah\n\nChronixx, Raging Fyah, Don Carlos, Assassin, Kapten Röd, Jesse Royal, Ken Ring, Kaliffa, Labyrint, Dani M., Junior Natural, Essa Cham, Löst Folk,\n\nMr. Vegas, Queen Ifrica, Tony Rebel, Richie Spice, Gyptian, Heptones, Elephant Man, Ken Boothe, Johnny Clarke, Pressure, Protoje, Don Corleone, Romain Virgo, Quique Neira, Kapten Röd, Norrisman, Trinity Sound, Fatman Sound, Million Vibes, Silly Walks, The Maytals featuring Leba (from Toots & The Maytals).\n\nAbyssinians, Alaine, Alborosie & The Shengen Clan, Anthony B, Bunny Wailer, Busy Signal, Channel One Sound System feat.

{"id": "48552707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48552707", "title": "Vanessa Williams and Miss America", "text": "Vanessa Williams and Miss America\n\nVanessa Williams (born March 18, 1963) is an American actress, singer, and fashion designer. She initially gained recognition as the first African American winner of the Miss America title when she was crowned Miss America 1984 in September 1983. Several weeks before the end of her reign, however, a scandal arose when \"Penthouse\" magazine bought and published unauthorized nude photographs of Williams. Williams was pressured to relinquish her title, and was succeeded by the first runner-up, Miss New Jersey 1983, Suzette Charles. Thirty-two years later, in September 2015, when Williams served as head judge for the Miss America 2016 pageant, former Miss America CEO Sam Haskell made a public apology to her for the events of 1984.\n\nWhen she was 20 years old, Williams was approached by scouts from the Miss Syracuse pageant who had seen her perform while a student at Syracuse University. Despite their encouragement, Williams was not interested in participating in the pageant. She later changed her mind when she realized that she could earn scholarship money. Although she had never participated in a beauty pageant before, she won the title of Miss Syracuse in April 1983. She then went on to win Miss New York in July 1983 During the preliminaries for the Miss America pageant, Williams won \"Preliminary Swimsuit\" and \"Preliminary Talent\" (with a vocal performance of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\"). She was also crowned Miss America 1984 on September 17, 1983, becoming the first African American woman to win the title.\n\nDuring her reign as Miss America, Williams was criticized in some venues for winning. She later stated that \"there were a lot of people that did not want me to be representative of the United States and Miss America. And not just white people alone. There were a lot of people who had issues [...] I was too light. My eyes were the wrong color. My hair wasn't the right texture and getting criticism for being who I was.\" She was also the target of persistent racist hate mail and death threats (which she documented in her memoir, \"You Have No Idea\"). Thirty years later, when Miss America 2014 Nina Davuluri (who was also a former Miss New York and Miss Syracuse) became the target of a racist social media backlash, Williams recounted the similarities with her own experiences, stating that she \"wrote a book about everything that I went through, and I spent a lot of time talking about the death threats, the FBI, the sharpshooters ... it was a graver situation and more dangerous years ago—the change that was happening and the uproar because of the color of my skin.\"\n\nWilliams would later comment that she was one of five minority contestants that year, noting that ballet dancer Deneen Graham \"had already had a cross burned on her front yard because she was the first black Miss North Carolina [1983].\" She also pointed out that \"Suzette Charles was the first runner-up, and she was biracial. But when the press started, when I would go out on the - on the tour and do my appearances, and people would come up and say they never thought they'd see the day that it would happen; when people would want to shake my hand, and you'd see tears in their eyes, and they'd say, I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime - that's when, you know, it was definitely a very special honor.\"\n\nIn July 1984 (two months before the end of her reign), Williams learned that nude photos of her, taken before her involvement with the pageant, would be published without her consent in a future issue of \"Penthouse\". Williams believed that the private photographs had been destroyed; she stated that she never signed a release permitting publication or use of the photos in a public format. In contrast, Hugh Hefner the publisher of \"Playboy\", was also given the opportunity to publish these photos but turned it down stating: \"The single victim in all of this was the young woman herself, whose right to make this decision was taken away from her. If she wanted to make this kind of statement, that would be her business, but the statement wasn't made by her.\"\n\nThe black-and-white photos dated back to the summer of 1982 (after her freshman year at Syracuse University) when she worked as an assistant and makeup artist for Mount Kisco, New York photographer Tom Chiapel. At the time, Williams stated that Chiapel said that \"he had a concept of having two models pose nude for silhouettes, basically to make different shapes and forms. The light would be behind the models. I was reluctant, but since he assured me that I would be the only one to see them and I would not be identifiable in the photographs, I agreed. He had also gotten another model to agree to this.\" In a 2012 interview with NPR, Williams discussed these events stating that her mother:\n\nKept saying, 'you're just like your father; you're too trusting' And there's a part of me that, I do give people the benefit of the doubt ... it's also being free ... that was the mode I was in at that particular time, when I took those racy pictures, because I was already in college so you can't tell me what to do. So - I wasn't actually in high school - so my mentality was what - I'm living my own life; I'm a spirited, young woman; I can handle this; I can handle anything. And at 19, you think you rule the world, and you can control things. And a lot of times, you don't.\n\nAfter learning that \"Penthouse\" would be publishing these photos, the Miss America Organization responded by giving Williams 72 hours to resign. Williams later stated that \"the heightened spectacle and circus of it all was kind of crazy. I had people saying 'Fight for the crown! Fight for the crown!' and people chanting 'Don't give it up! Don't secede!' \" Williams also later noted that the situation was particularly hard on her mother Helen, who felt that she should not resign as Williams had performed her \"duties and excelled at everything I was asked to do plus doing 50% more of appearances that were not scheduled because I was the first African American Miss America.\" Helen was also upset that \"the pageant did not come to my support, they felt I needed to resign.\"\n\nWilliams, however, decided to resign, and formally announced her decision at a press conference held on July 23, 1984. The title subsequently went to the first runner-up, Miss New Jersey Suzette Charles who served out the final seven weeks of Williams' reign. On September 7, 1984, Williams filed a $500 million lawsuit against Chiapel and \"Penthouse\" publisher Bob Guccione; she dropped the lawsuit a year later stating that she wanted to put the scandal behind her. Ultimately, \"Penthouse\" published the unauthorized photos in its September 1984 issue, which the PBS documentary \"Miss America\" described as \"the most successful issue \"Penthouse\" magazine ever printed, netting Guccione a windfall profit of $14 million.\"\n\nAfter her resignation, Williams rebounded as a recording artist and actress. However, she also faced a long period of what she would later describe as \"the betrayal, and the humiliation, that happened to me on a grand scale.\"\"Essence\" magazine concurred stating that Williams was the subject of \"public shaming and bullying from the public at large\" and \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" noted that her \"career and reputation tanked. Overnight, [Williams] went from being America's darling to a national disgrace.\" \n\nShe would also later state that these events delayed her career by about ten years, as \"it seemed like an eternity in which I was the punch line to every late-night monologue ... Joan Rivers, whom I adored and met on \"The Tonight Show\" during my reign, was particularly relentless. Just when I figured she'd exhausted every possible Vanessa Williams joke, she'd have a whole new slew of them.\" Williams would also later tell of one audition that she had during the late 1980s for a theatrical role. She was denied the role, however, because \"the wife of lyricist Ira Gershwin decreed: 'Over my dead body will that whore be in my show.' \" In addition, her parents experienced \"an incredible amount of shame and humiliation\" and were equally the subject of harassment at the time.\n\nThirty years after the scandal broke, Amanda Marcotte suggested in \"The Daily Beast\" that \n\nwe owe a lot to Vanessa Williams for being a pioneer when it comes to showing the world how to recover when you've been unjustly shamed for being sexual. Williams could have slunk off into the shadows in shame, which no doubt many people at the time expected her to do. Williams picked herself up and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had nothing to be ashamed of. \n\nIn addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with \"Entertainment Tonight\" by stating that \"you can't give up ... you always have to remember what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way. They might delay your progress for the moment, but you always have to remember who you are, and that will give you the eyes on the prize.\"\n\nThirty-two years later, Williams returned to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, where she served as head judge for Miss America 2016 and sang \"Oh How the Years Go By.\" After this performance, former Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issued a public apology to Williams, stating:\n\nI have been a close friend of this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years. You have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984, when you resigned. Though none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize to you and to your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be.\n\nWilliams responded by stating that she did the \"best that I could, in my reign as Miss America, from 1983 to 1984.\"\n\nA few months after the pageant, Williams discussed the apology in an interview with Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O'Donnell for \"CBS This Morning\". King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, \"I think many people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.\" Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song \"Oh How the Years Go By\" (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed his hand on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant was about to happen. Williams said that one of the most important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had on her mother, who \"endured a lot\" during that period.\n\nAfter the pageant, Williams' replacement Suzette Charles stated in an interview with \"Inside Edition\" that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams had previously commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that \"there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there.\" In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), \"people now release [similar] things to make a career.\"\nWilliams responded: \"That's crazy. To think that oh you can look at a scandal and think that that would be good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of credibility and talent that I had and wiped it out.\"\n\n\n\n\nMiss America 2016\n\nPost-Miss America 1984\n\nJuly 1984 resignation speech\n\nMiss America 1984\n"}

The show takes place on a weekend in mid-July each year, but as of 2013, late June. The history of this flight exhibition dates back to 1910 and the Wright Company. Dayton is the hometown of the Wright brothers and is where Orville and Wilbur built their first powered plane. The show's main sponsor is Vectren Corporation and it is considered to be one of the country’s premier aviation events.\n\nIt is estimated that the 2010 Dayton Air Show attracted nearly 80,000 people and had a $5 million impact on the Dayton region's local economy. \nThe 2012 show is estimated to have a $3 million impact on Dayton's economy.\n\nThe Dayton Air Show showcases some of the world's best known civilian and military pilots. One of which includes the Blue Angels Other notable yearly performances include: the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, U.S. Army Golden Knights, Sean D. Tucker, Patty Wagstaff, and others. Included with these are also various fly-overs by aircraft such as the F-18 Super Hornet, B-2 Spirit, B-52 Stratofortress, A-10 Thunderbolt, P-51 Mustang, C-5 Galaxy, and more. Along with performances, there are also more than 100 ground aircraft on display.\n\nThe following is a list of all aircraft that have performed in the Dayton Air Show in 2009 and 2010. Please note that only the acts are listed, not static displays or other ground attractions.\n\n2011* (performances as of 1/20/11)\n\n2010\n\n2009\n\n\n2008\n\n2007\n\nThe US Air Trade and Technology Conference and Exposition (USATT) was initiated by Congressman Mike Turner to bring together contractors, subcontractors, governments, and others to discuss issues pertaining to the aerospace industry. The program focuses on UAVs, human performance, sensors, and alternative fuels, among other things. Although the (USATT) takes place during the Dayton Air Show, it is not open to the public.\n\nAn accident during a stunt flight resulted in the death of Jim LeRoy, who was pronounced dead on July 28, 2007 in a military MEDEVAC helicopter while in transit to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton, Ohio. The reason of this crash was reported as pilot error by the NTSB.\n\nOn June 22, 2013, a plane carrying wing walker Jane Wicker crashed at the air show, killing both Wicker and pilot Charlie Schwenker.\n\nOn June 23, 2017, the day before the air show, a Thunderbirds F-16D jet, not scheduled to perform, was taxiing to a staging area after a familiarization flight, when witnesses reported a gust of wind flipped the aircraft onto its top in a grassy area next to the taxiway. Both the pilot and a team crew member were trapped in the airplane for two hours; the pilot suffered only minor injuries while the crew member had no visible injuries. The Thunderbirds canceled their scheduled performances for both days of the air show.\n\nUnusually high temperatures led to greatly decreased attendance for the 2012 show. As such, it was announced in October, 2012 that the 2013 show would be moved from July to June. The trend has continued through 2016; the 2016 show was held from June 18-19 2016. The previous year's air show had lost attendance as well due to weather, however, the loss was due to heavy rains, which also forced the temporary grounding of some acts. An estimated 51,000 spectators attended the 2016 show, a large increase from the 40,000 of the previous year. This was despite the absence of a scheduled headliner act, the Blue Angels, following the group's temporary grounding due to the death of one of its pilots in a crash on June 2.\n\n"}
