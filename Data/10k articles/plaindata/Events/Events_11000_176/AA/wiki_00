The International Olympic Committee (IOC) awarded the 1940 Summer Olympics to Tokyo, Japan in July 1936. Tokyo's ability to host the event was questioned after war broke out with China (the Second Sino-Japanese War) with some countries calling for the Games to be boycotted. The Japanese decided to cancel the event and Helsinki, Finland, the runner-up city in the bidding process, was selected as the replacement. That too was cancelled after the outbreak of World War II.\n\nAt the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin the first torch relay event took place, starting a tradition that has continued in all the Games that have taken place since. Both National Olympic Committees had given details about their plan for the Olympic Torch relay.\n\nThe distance from Olympia to Berlin made it possible to hold a relay on foot in a reasonable amount of time, but the distance to Tokyo gave the IOC cause for concern. They discussed the viability of such an undertaking on numerous occasions and eventually decided that they should try to replicate the success of the inaugural torch relay using \"[s]teamers, automobiles, and airplanes\". A report into the progress made on the planning of the Games stated that there would be a significant benefit \"in diffusing the Olympic spirit in the districts where the knowledge of the Olympic movement is as yet very scanty\".\n\nThe organisation team behind the 1936 relay made recommendations to the Japanese Olympic Committee about how it could be completed. Their suggestions would see the torch carried for 10,000 km by runners and horse riders, travelling along the Silk Road across Central Asia. A significant portion of the relay would therefore take place across China, an idea not favoured by the Japanese. Another proposal, coming from Germany, was to pioneer the idea of air delivery of the Torch, in the purpose-built Messerschmitt Me 261 \"Adolfine\" long-range aircraft, which was designed to have a maximum range of some 11,024 km (6,850 mi) unrefueled.\n\nSeveral suggestions were made by the Japanese Olympic Committee about how the flame could be taken from Olympia to Tokyo. One proposal was for the torch to be carried on board a Japanese warship, but a later idea was for it to be taken by the \"Kamikaze\", a Mitsubishi Ki-15 plane, across southern Asia. When the flame arrived in Japan it would be carried from Mount Hyūga in Kyushu to Tokyo via the Ise Grand Shrine.\n\nA relay from Olympia to Tokyo eventually took place when the city hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Finnish Olympic Committee planned an ambitious relay that would cross Europe. The first part of the route would be very similar to that of 1936 as the torch travelled up to Berlin, the only addition being a detour to Slovakia. From there it would make its way through to Scandinavia, taken by a rowing boat where necessary.\n\nThere was a further proposal that the flame would make its way to every Olympic Stadium in each host city of the previous ten Summer Games. Cauldrons at these locations would also keep the flame burning for the duration of the Games. While the torch route would include Athens, Berlin, and Stockholm the other host cities were further afield and would require alternative arrangements. Suggestions included branching off the relay to the European cities but it would be more difficult to arrange travel to the two in the United States.\n\nThe route would visit the following cities across Europe:\n"}

The number of entrants to the national championships was cut down to eleven teams through a playdown system of regional qualifiers and a challenge round.\nAs with last year, teams qualified for the men's nationals either by qualifying automatically as one of the top two teams on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit, by qualifying through a regional qualifier, or by qualifying through the challenge round. The two teams that qualified automatically to the championships were chosen based on the Order of Merit upon the conclusion of the Curl Mesabi Cash Spiel. This year, the teams were those skipped by Tyler George and Craig Brown. The other eight spots in the nationals were awarded as follows: five were awarded to the top finishers in the regional qualifiers, and three were awarded to the top finishers in the challenge round.\n\nThe qualification rounds were all held with the double knockout provision in place. The double knockout provision states that a team is eliminated from qualifying for the nationals if the team has at least two losses in their win-loss record. If there are teams with less than two losses, they will play each other until the number of teams still able to qualify matches the number of qualification spots available.\n\nThe qualifiers were held from January 4 to 8 in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Seattle, Washington, Grand Forks, North Dakota, and Laurel, Maryland, given that at least five teams sign up at each qualifier. If there were less than five teams signed up at any site, the qualifier at that site would have been cancelled, and teams could either be moved to an alternate site or cancel their registration. Qualifiers with more than ten teams would have been held in a knockout format, and qualifiers with less than ten teams would have been held in a round robin format. Each qualifier site was awarded one or more qualification spots to the nationals based on the strength of field at each qualifier site. The strength of field of each team was calculated using Order of Merit points, past participation in national championships and world championships, and final ranks at past national championships. In total, five teams qualified from the four regional qualifiers, and eight teams moved from the qualifiers to the challenge round. This year, the teams that qualified from the regional qualifiers were those skipped by Heath McCormick, Wes Johnson, John Shuster, Owen Sampson, and Blake Morton.\n\nThe top eight finishers from the regional qualifiers that did not qualify for the nationals were invited to play in the challenge round, which were held from January 19 to 22 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Two other teams that were not qualified to either the nationals or the challenge round were then invited based on their Order of Merit points. If a team qualifying to the challenge round through a regional qualifier declined its invitation, the spot would have been filled based on the Order of Merit. A maximum of ten teams could play at the challenge round. The number of teams invited from each qualifier were determined using the strength of field system. The challenge round was played in a round robin format. At the conclusion of the round robin, the top three teams were chosen to qualify to the nationals. This year, those teams were those skipped by Eric Fenson, Mike Farbelow, and Todd Birr.\n\nAll four qualifiers were held at their respective locations from January 4 to 8. A total of 39 teams registered to participate in the regional qualifiers. Of these teams, three teams qualified directly to the nationals without participation in the qualifying rounds. The rink skipped by Pete Fenson did not have to participate in the qualifiers due to their participation on behalf of the United States at the 2012 USA-Brazil Challenge. Two teams, skipped by Tyler George and Craig Brown, qualified directly to the nationals by virtue of their Order of Merit rankings. If Fenson was one of the top two ranked Order of Merit teams, there would only have been one other team qualifying directly to the nationals via Order of Merit, but Fenson was not one of the top two ranked Order of Merit teams, so the top two ranked teams qualified directly to the nationals.\n\nThe following is a list of all teams registered to participate in the regional qualifiers. The teams skipped by Pete Fenson, Craig Brown, and Tyler George qualified automatically, and as such did not need to participate in the qualifying rounds.\n\nThe Laurel qualifier was held at the Potomac Curling Club in Laurel, Maryland. It was held in a round robin format. At the conclusion of the round robin, the top team qualified directly to the Nationals, and the second-ranked team qualified to the Challenge Round. The team skipped by Heath McCormick qualified directly to the Nationals, and the team skipped by Derek Surka qualified to the Challenge Round.\n\n\"Final Round Robin Standings\"\n\n\"Standings after Tiebreakers\"\n\n\"Thursday, January 5, 2:00 pm\"\n\n\"Thursday, January 5, 7:00 pm\"\n\n\"Friday, January 6, 9:00 am\"\n\n\"Friday, January 6, 2:00 pm\"\n\n\"Friday, January 6, 7:00 pm\"\n\n\"Saturday, January 7, 9:00 am\"\n\n\"Saturday, January 7, 2:00 pm\"\n\n\"Saturday, January 7, 7:00 pm\"\n\n\"Saturday, January 7, 9:00 am\"\n\n\"Sunday, January 8, 2:00 pm\"\n\"Sunday, January 8, 7:00 pm\"\nThe Seattle qualifier was held at the Granite Curling Club in Seattle, Washington.

{"id": "19096270", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19096270", "title": "Alaska Public Safety Commissioner dismissal", "text": "Alaska Public Safety Commissioner dismissal\n\nThe Alaska Public Safety Commissioner dismissal, also known as Troopergate, involves the possibly illegal July 2008 dismissal of the Alaskan Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan by Governor Sarah Palin for not firing Alaskan State Trooper Mike Wooten, who was in a bitter divorce with Palin's Sister.\n\nOn October 10, 2008, the twelve-member bipartisan Alaska Legislative Council hired investigator Stephen Branchflower to investigate the matter. The Legislative council voted unanimously to release the so called, Branchflower Report, which found that Palin had violated the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act covering state executive employees when she dismissed Monegan for not firing Wooten.\n\nUnder Alaska law, the state's three-member State Personnel Board, not the Legislative Council, decides whether a governor has violated the ethics laws. On November 3, 2008, the bipartisan Personnel Board which had been appointed by Palin, released the findings of its own investigation which concluded that Palin did not violate any ethics laws. No action was ever taken.\n\nSarah Palin, who in late August became the Republican vice presidential nominee in the 2008 United States presidential election, said that she reassigned commissioner Walt Monegan because of performance-related issues. Monegan said that his forced resignation may have been tied to his reluctance to fire Mike Wooten, an Alaska State Trooper who is also Palin's ex-brother-in-law. Monegan said that the Governor herself, her husband, and members of her staff as well as the state's Attorney General, had contacted him numerous times regarding Wooten. At the time Palin dismissed Monegan, Wooten was involved in a custody battle with his former wife, Molly McCann, Palin's sister.\n\nPalin denied that there had been any pressure on Monegan to fire Wooten, either from herself or from anyone in her administration. In mid-August, Palin acknowledged that \"pressure could have been perceived to exist, although I have only now become aware of it.\" She also apologized to Alaskans for what she called \"this distraction.\"\n\nBefore Palin became governor, she and other members of her family had made various allegations of misconduct against Wooten. An internal investigation upheld some charges and rejected others. On March 1, 2006 the chief of the Alaska state police issued a letter of reprimand to Wooten, and he served a five-day suspension as penalty. After Palin became governor in December 2006, she, her husband Todd Palin, and various aides had further contacts with Monegan about Wooten. Monegan told both Sarah Palin and Todd Palin that the disciplinary proceeding against Wooten was concluded and could not be reopened.\n\nPalin was investigated by an independent investigator, hired by a unanimous vote of a bipartisan committee of the Alaska Legislature, \"to investigate the circumstances … surrounding [Monegan's termination], and potential abuses of power and/or improper actions by members of the executive branch.\" Palin denied any wrongdoing. Democratic state Senator Hollis French, who is overseeing the investigation, stated the report will \"likely be damaging\" to the Palin administration, and may be an October surprise. In response to those remarks by French, Republican state Senator John Coghill pushed an unsuccessful effort to have French removed from managing the investigation.\n\nTodd Palin did not honor a September 2008 subpoena to appear in court to testify about his role in Troopergate. Two other key witnesses also failed to appear, and all three were originally referred to the full Alaska Senate for contempt. These contempt charges were not addressed until the state legislature met in January 2009, when the legislature had several options including physically bringing the witnesses in, imposing jail time, and levying fines. With the refusals to testify, Senator Hollis French, the Democrat chosen to oversee the charges, moved forward with the investigation.\nPalin's attorney general announced on October 5, 2008, that seven state employees would honor subpoenas to testify in the legislative investigation of the Troopergate affair.\n\nOn October 10, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council unanimously voted to release, without endorsing, the Branchflower investigative report which found that Sarah Palin \"abused her power as governor [in] attempting to get Trooper Wooten fired.\"\n\nIn 1999, Sarah Palin's sister Molly McCann and Mike Wooten began dating. In 2000, Palin wrote a character reference for Wooten. In 2001, Wooten became an Alaska State Trooper. Also in 2001, McCann and Wooten got married. In January 2005, they were separated.\n\nOn April 11, 2005, McCann filed for divorce from Wooten. That day a judge granted a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) against Wooten. The same day, McCann's father Chuck Heath phoned police to inform them about the DVPO.\n\nAlso that day, police spoke with McCann. She said Wooten had threatened to shoot her father if he hired an attorney to help in her divorce. McCann said that although Wooten \"has never physically abused her,\" he \"acts very intimidating.\" She also accused him of using illegal testosterone supplements, drunk driving, and threatening to \"take down\" Palin if she got involved. McCann said she was \"scared\" of what Wooten \"would do when he finds out she has hired an attorney.\"\n\nBased on McCann's complaint, the Alaska State Troopers began an investigation into the claims made, interviewing more than fifteen witnesses.\n\nIn May 2005, Sarah Palin told police that she and her son Track overheard a death threat against her father (Heath), in February 2005, when McCann allowed her to listen in on an argument through a phone line (speakerphone).\n\nPalin said she had not called police at that time because she did not want to put Wooten's career in jeopardy, and the situation had not progressed to physical violence. On August 10, 2005, Palin sent an email to Col. Julia Grimes, head of the Alaska State Troopers, urging that Wooten be dismissed and giving more details about the alleged death threat. The email from Palin to Grimes said that the February 2005 threat by Wooten to shoot Heath came after McCann had accused Wooten of attending an event with another woman. In the email, Palin described Wooten as \"a loose cannon\" and \"a ticking timebomb,\" and said that failing to fire Wooten \"would lead a rational person to believe there is a problem inside the organization.\"\n\nAs a result of the email, Palin was interviewed again by state troopers on August 18, 2005. During this interview, she stated that she did not warn her father of the death threat until two weeks after it was made; she explained the delay by saying that Wooten had no reason to shoot Heath. According to Heath himself, the delay was a month: \"Heath stated that his daughters didn't report the incident to him until a month later.\"\n\nOn May 9, a court hearing was held regarding the DVPO. At this hearing the DVPO was quashed because McCann's counsel was unable to produce evidence of any acts of physical or implied violence.\n\nIn October 2005, the divorce went to trial. During the trial, Judge John Suddock expressed puzzlement at the efforts of McCann's family to get Wooten fired, since it would harm his earning capacity and damage his ability to pay child support. Judge Suddock said \"it appears for the world that Ms. McCann and her family have decided to take off for the guy's livelihood -- that the bitterness of whatever who did what to whom has overridden good judgment.\" A representative for the Alaska State Trooper's union testified that the union viewed the dozen complaints filed by McCann and her family against Wooten as \"not job-related\" and \"harassment.\" Judge Suddock repeatedly warned McCann and her family to stop \"disparaging\" Wooten's reputation or risk the judge granting Wooten custody of the children. At a court hearing in October 2005, Judge Suddock said \"disparaging will not be tolerated—it is a form of child abuse … relatives cannot disparage either. If occurs [sic] the parent needs to set boundaries for their relatives.\"\n\nIn the divorce decree that was granted on January 31, 2006, Judge Suddock expressed concern about continued criticism by McCann's family towards Wooten and noted that he would pay particular attention to problems raised by a custody investigator. Legal disputes between Wooten and McCann over custody, child support and visitation rights continued through 2007 and 2008.\n\nOn October 29, 2005, Sgt. Wall issued a Memorandum of Findings describing the results of his investigation.\n\nWall's investigation report dated October 29, 2005 found that Wooten violated internal policy, but not the law, in making a death threat against Molly McCann's father Heath on February 17, 2005. Molly McCann, Sarah Palin and Track Palin said that he made the threat. Wooten said that he didn't make the threat. Wall decided that he had in fact done so. Wall concluded that the death threat was not a crime because Wooten did not threaten the father directly; therefore, Wall deemed the threat to be a violation of trooper policy rather than a violation of criminal law. Although the death threat was listed as a violation of trooper policy OPM 101.070(A) Unbecoming Conduct and OPM 101.070(B) Personal Conduct in the Memorandum of Findings, it was not mentioned at all in the suspension letter sent to Wooten by Col. Grimes on March 1, 2006.\n\nThe investigation found that Wooten had committed a hunting violation in shooting a moose without a permit: he had been out hunting with McCann in September 2003 and had shot the animal himself even though their permit was in McCann's name only. According to subsequent news reports, McCann had obtained the permit but balked at killing the moose herself, so she handed the gun to her then-husband, who shot the animal.\n\nWooten was also found to have violated department policy in using a Taser on his then 11-year-old stepson in 2003. He told investigators that he did so \"in a training capacity\" after the child had asked to be tased. In a September 2008 newspaper interview, Wooten said that he set the Taser to \"test\" mode, meaning that it was on low power. In a statement to police, the boy said \"he wanted to be tased to show that he's not a mommy's boy in front of Bristol [his cousin, Palin's daughter]. Following being tased he went upstairs to tell his mother that he was fine.\" In a statement to police, Molly McCann said \"she was up stairs giving a bath to the kids … Mike was going to show Payton what it feels like and she told Mike that he better not.\" According to Molly's account, she remained upstairs during the incident.\n\nAlthough the Taser incident happened in 2003, it was not reported to police until on or after April 11, 2005, the day McCann filed for divorce. On June 6, 2005, a police investigator asked Bristol why they \"waited so long and brought the incident up after two years.\" Bristol said \"because of the divorce and stuff\".\n\nThe investigation initially cleared Wooten on all the alcohol-related charges, but Grimes overturned that result and found that Wooten did, \"Take [an] open beer with him when he drove away in his trooper vehicle,\" on one occasion in the summer of 2004, violating both the law and internal trooper policy. Wooten was not on duty; he was wearing \"civilian attire.\" And he \"drove approximately one mile to his residence.\" Because Wooten \"was a member of the SERT [SWAT] team … he [was allowed to] use his State vehicle for personal use.\" The only witnesses to this event were close friends of Sarah Palin's father: \"Adrian Lane was a student of Chuck Heath's in Idaho when he was a child and they have been close friends ever since.\" This is apparently why the original Memorandum of Findings treated this allegation as \"Not Sustained.\" Wooten denied this allegation.\n\nWooten was cleared of numerous other allegations made by McCann and her family, including that he had taken illegal steroid and testosterone supplements, that he had physically assaulted McCann, and that he had illegally shot a wolf from a helicopter.\n\nAside from the alleged death threat against Heath, Sarah and Molly had also accused Wooten of making threats that he would \"bring down\" Sarah and her family. Sarah Palin had no first-hand knowledge of these threats; she heard about them via Molly. Molly told police she understood Wooten to mean that he could use his position as a trooper to make life difficult for Sarah. Wooten denied making this threat. The police investigation treated this allegation as \"Not Sustained.\"\n\nBased on the internal investigation findings, Grimes announced on March 1, 2006 that she would suspend Wooten for ten days. In announcing the suspension, Grimes referred to the Taser, moose and beer incidents, and also to seven other negative actions in Wooten's personnel file, such as failing to use turn signals. She did not mention the alleged death threat or any other allegations regarding threats. She concluded that \"[t]he record clearly indicates a serious and concentrated pattern of unacceptable and at times, illegal activity occurring over a lengthy period, which establishes a course of conduct totally at odds with the ethics of our profession\". After a union protest, the suspension was reduced to five days, and Grimes warned Wooten he would be fired if he committed any further misconduct.\n\nIn early December 2006, Palin took office as Governor of Alaska and appointed Walter C. Monegan III to be Public Safety Commissioner, a cabinet position. Monegan is a former police chief of Anchorage and son of Walter C. Monegan, Jr. According to the investigator hired by the state legislature, \"Right about that time, a little after the swearing in,\" someone from Palin's office called Monegan's office to schedule a meeting between Monegan and Todd Palin, the governor's husband.\n\nAccording to Monegan, the meeting took place in the Governor's office on January 4, 2007, with only Monegan and Todd Palin present. Palin asked Monegan to look into the Wooten affair. He gave Monegan various records, including material from a private investigator hired by the Palin family. Palin said that he disagreed with the five-day suspension, as inadequate and insufficient, and accused Wooten of a variety of transgressions, including drunken driving and child abuse. He asked Monegan to revisit the matter in light of some additional evidence he was providing. Monegan agreed to do that. He detailed some staff for the review, who made a page-by-page comparison with the investigation that had been done earlier, and told Monegan that there was nothing new. Monegan then told Todd Palin that there was nothing he could do as the case was closed. The troopers operate under a union contract that restricts the circumstances under which a trooper can be fired.\n\nAccording to Monegan, Governor Palin raised the matter with him personally twice, in January and February, and then kept raising the matter indirectly through e-mails, though she did not again bring it up directly. In an email sent to Monegan on February 7, 2007 about a proposed bill to require 99-year sentences for police officers found guilty of murder, Palin mentioned Wooten as an example of an officer who violated the public trust. The email listed several examples of Wooten's alleged misbehavior. Another Palin email, dated July 17, 2007, concerned a proposed bill to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill. Palin wrote to Monegan that her first thoughts \"went to my ex-brother-in-law, the trooper, who threatened to kill my dad yet was not even reprimanded by his bosses and still to this day carries a gun, of course.\" A spokesperson for the McCain-Palin campaign says that Palin's contacts with Monegan were only to alert him to potential threats to her family.\n\nMonegan also has said he got telephone calls from three Palin appointees: her then-chief of staff, Mike Tibbles; Commissioner Annette Kreitzer of the Department of Administration; and Attorney General Talis Colberg. Colberg said he called after Todd Palin asked him about \"the process\" for handling death threats made by state troopers against the first family. Monegan told Colberg the matter had been handled, and Colberg reported back to Todd Palin that nothing more could be done. In mid-August 2008, the Alaska Attorney General's inquiry reported that Palin's staff had made about two dozen contacts with public safety officials about Wooten, in 2007 and 2008, with more than half initiated by Tibbles.\n\nIn April 2007, Todd Palin told the \"Anchorage Daily News\" he had met once with Wooten's supervisor, Colonel Audie Holloway, to give her pictures of Wooten driving a snowmobile when he was out on a worker's compensation claim. Diane Kiesel, Alaska state personnel director, also called Holloway about the snowmobile incident.\n\nOn November 19, 2007, a meeting was called by Mike Tibbles, at the time Palin's chief of staff, to discuss the process of how Wooten had returned to work after a worker's compensation injury. Present were Kevin Brooks, the deputy commissioner of the Department of Administration, Nicki Neal, director of the Personnel Division, and Diane Kiesel, former director of Personnel and Labor Relations.\nOn February 29, 2008, Frank Bailey, the governor's director of boards and commissions, made a phone call to trooper Lt. Rodney Dial, the state troopers' liaison to the legislature. The Public Safety Department recorded the call, as it does routinely, and the Palin administration released an audiotape of it on August 13. In it, Bailey made several accusations against Wooten, including that he lied on his application to become a trooper. He was recorded saying \"Todd and Sarah are scratching their heads, 'why on earth hasn't, why is this guy still representing the department?' \" and \"I'm telling you honestly, you know, she really likes Walt [Monegan] a lot, but on this issue, she feels like it's, she doesn't know why there is absolutely no action for a year on this issue. It's very, very troubling to her and the family. I could definitely relay that.\" Bailey said in an interview on August 13 that no one had asked him to make the call and he didn't know why he indicated in the call that he was speaking on behalf of the Palins. A transcript of the call is available.\n\nCell records show that Todd Palin spoke to Palin aide Ivy Frye three times on the afternoon of February 28, the day before Bailey's conversation with Dial. About three hours after the last call, the first of ten emails began to circulate between Ivy Frye, Sarah Palin, her husband Todd, Bailey, Administration Commissioner Annette Kreitzer, Deputy Chief of Staff Randy Ruaro and Palin aide Kris Perry. The exchanges continued overnight and into the morning of Bailey's phone call.\n\nShortly before the annual celebration of Police Memorial Day on May 15, 2008, Commissioner Monegan dropped off a color photograph at Governor Palin's Anchorage office with a request that she sign and present it at the ceremony. The photograph was of an Alaska State Trooper, dressed in a formal uniform, saluting. He was standing in front of the police memorial located in front of the crime lab at AST headquarters in Anchorage, partially obscured by a flagpole. The picture to be signed by the Governor was to be used as a poster to be displayed in various Trooper Detachments around the state.\n\nShortly after he returned to his office from dropping off the photograph, he received a call from Kris Perry, Governor Palin's Director of her Anchorage office, who asked (according to Walt Monegan's testimony), \"Why did you send a poster over here that has a picture of Mike Wooten on it?\" Until that moment, Commissioner Monegan apparently never realized it was indeed a photograph of Trooper Wooten. Governor Palin canceled her appearance and sent Lieutenant Governor Parnell in her place.\n\nAt least three dozen people contacted Monegan's office over a 19-month period. Kim Peterson, Mr. Monegan's special assistant and a 31-year human resources employee of the State of Alaska, said she fielded about a dozen calls. \"It was very clear that someone from the governor's office wanted him watched,\" she told the \"New York Times\". Mr. Palin had called Ms. Peterson to claim that he had seen Wooten riding a snowmobile while on disability for a back injury and asked her to investigate. When Mr. Palin called back two weeks later asking for a response, Peterson told him that she could not discuss it because it was a confidential personnel matter.\n\nDianne Kiesel, a deputy director at the Department of Administration, called Ms. Peterson to suggest that Wooten could be reassigned to the cold-case unit or perform background checks. Ms. Peterson responded that those options would violate the union contract. Annette Kreitzer, Commissioner of the Alaskan Department of Administration, also called Monegan and Peterson about Wooten.\n\nOn July 11, 2008, Palin's acting chief of staff Mike Nizich dismissed Monegan, offering him a position as executive director of the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, which he turned down.\n\nIn a letter to DPS employees announcing his termination, Monegan wrote that he was an at-will employee and knew his dismissal was, \"A possibility ever present\", and that he had been advised that the governor wanted to take DPS in a \"different direction\". In an interview the next day Monegan said that the dismissal had come \"out of the blue\" and that \"[i]f the governor was upset with me for one thing or another, it had never been communicated to me.\"\n\nThe accusation that Governor Palin may have abused her power when her attempt to reassign Commissioner Walt Monegan resulted in his termination of employment appeared in the blog of Andrew Halcro on Thursday, July 17, 2008. Halcro claimed that Monegan was \"fired\" because of his budget battles with the governor and because he refused to fire Trooper Wooten.\n\nHalcro's blog reported that Monegan thought he was going into the meeting to smooth over the ruffled feathers caused from when his deputy, Holloway, denied the governor's chief of security, Cocerall, an extra trooper for security at the governor's picnic. Instead he was fired. The legislators agreed to hire a special investigator to look into the issue to clear the air.\n\n\"That's the only thing I can think of, if you want to get to the truth and be unbiased,\" said Senate President Lyda Green, a Wasilla Republican. \"Otherwise, speculation just continues.\"<ref name=\"Lawmakers may look into Monegan firing (7/19/08)\"></ref>\n\nTen days later, on July 28, 2008, the Alaska Legislative Council met and voted 12–0 to delegate their authority to the Council Chairman, Senator Elton, to hire legal services to investigate the termination of Commissioner Monegan. They named Senator Hollis French as Project Director for the contract. The report was intended that the \"investigation be professional, unbiased, independent, objective, and conducted at arm's length from the political process\". The investigators report was to be submitted to the Legislative Council.\n\nSenator French hired Stephen Branchflower to conduct the investigation. The contract was signed on July 31, 2008, and Branchflower began his investigation on August 11, 2008.\n\nOn July 17, Palin said publicly that \"We have [to] start recruiting. We have to start doing more than just talking about it. And taking action also.\" Monegan responded on July 18 that the two most recent trooper graduating classes had the most recruits in years. On July 18, Monegan suggested that his dismissal might have been related to his reluctance to fire Wooten. He said phone calls and questions from the Palin administration and the governor's husband, Todd Palin, about Wooten started shortly after Monegan was hired and continued until May or June 2008. Monegan said that Palin's acting chief of staff, Mike Nizich, told him on July 11 that he was being removed from his position because Palin wanted to take the Department of Public Safety in a different direction.\n\nOn July 18, in response to Monegan's comments, Palin released a statement:\n\nThe statement also denied that the governor had improperly accessed Wooten's employment records, saying that \"[t]o allege that I, or any member of my family, requested, received or released confidential personnel information on an Alaska State Trooper, or directed disciplinary action be taken against any employee of the Department of Public Safety, is, quite simply, outrageous. Any information regarding personnel records came from the trooper himself.\" Palin said \"absolutely no pressure [was] ever put on Commissioner Monegan to hire or fire anybody, at any time … no pressure was ever put on anybody to fire anybody.\" She also praised Monegan's replacement, saying \"Commissioner Kopp shares my vision for filling vacant positions and reducing crime across the state.\"\n\nIn late July, former U.S. Attorney Wevley Shea, who had acted previously as an informal adviser to Palin, wrote her an unsolicited letter in which he urged her to apologize for \"overreaching or perceived overreaching\" to get Wooten fired, and warned that the matter could snowball into a bigger scandal. The letter said that she should fire any aides who had raised concerns with Monegan.\n\nOn August 13, Palin said specifically that her action was unrelated to Wooten. She said that Monegan was dismissed for not adequately filling state trooper vacancies and fighting alcohol abuse problems, and because he \"did not turn out to be a team player on budgeting issues.\" Palin acknowledged that \"pressure could have been perceived to exist, although I have only now become aware of it.\" She suspended Frank Bailey, and apologized to Alaskans:\nOn August 28, in an interview with \"Anchorage Daily News\", Monegan said, \"For the record, no one ever said fire Wooten. Not the governor. Not Todd. Not any of the other staff. What they said directly was more along the lines of 'This isn't a person that we would want to be representing our state troopers.' \" He later added that he had resisted pressure from the governor and her husband to re-open the case against Wooten.\n\nIn an August interview with \"The New Yorker\", Palin blamed Monegan for failing to address alcohol abuse in rural Alaska. According to the \"New Yorker\" article, Palin stated that she didn't fire Monegan, but rather \"asked him to drop everything else and single-mindedly take on the state's drinking problem, as the director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.\" Palin characterized the job offered to Monegan as \"commensurate in salary pretty much—ten thousand dollars less\", but said that Monegan didn't want it, so he quit.\n\nIn September, in a televised interview with Charles Gibson of ABC News, Palin reiterated her position that she had dismissed Monegan because of his job performance and that neither she nor her husband pressured him to fire Wooten. Palin said \"I never pressured him to hire or fire anybody … I know that Todd, too, never pressured … Monegan.\" In response, Monegan said: \"She's not telling the truth when she told ABC neither she nor her husband pressured me to fire Trooper Wooten. And she's not telling the truth to the media about her reasons for firing me.\"\n\nMonegan has made a number of other statements alleging that he had been pressured to fire Wooten. \"There was pressure for that, yes.\" \"There were numerous contacts by the governor, her husband, by her staff that basically said that Trooper Wooten was not an acceptable example of an Alaska state trooper.\" \"The fact that they tried for better than a year while I was there is kind of indicative that somebody was trying to pressure something.\"\n\nOn September 2, 2008, \"a senior strategist in the McCain campaign\" said \"the man who was fired has said on the record that he was never pressured by the governor or the governor's husband on the issue of firing Trooper Wooten.\"\n\nOn September 15, 2008, McCain/Palin campaign spokeswoman Meg Stapleton held a news conference at which she accused Monegan of \"egregious insubordination\", \"obstructionist conduct\" and a \"brazen refusal\" to follow proper channels for requesting money. Asked why someone with a history of insubordination would be offered the leadership of the Alaska Alcoholic Beverage Control Board, Stapleton said that without having to deal with a budget, Monegan would be able to focus on alcohol abuse issues. She added that Palin \"respects the fact that he [Monegan] was respected in the community.\"\n\nMonegan's successor, Charles Kopp, testified that during the July 9, 2008, phone call seeing if he was still interested the commissioner's job, he asked why Monegan was leaving, and Frank Bailey told him that Governor Palin was upset by the episode where she was asked to autograph Wooten's photograph.\n\nThe Alaska Legislative Council is a bipartisan body of state House and Senate members who can convene to make decisions when the full legislature is not in session. As of July 2008 it was made up of four Democrats and eight Republicans. On July 28, 2008, the Legislative Council voted 12–0 to hire an independent investigator to investigate Palin and her staff for possible abuse of power or improper actions surrounding Monegan's dismissal. A retired state prosecutor, Stephen Branchflower, was named as the investigator. Branchflower was awarded a three-month contract, which began on August 1. In the same unanimous vote, the Council also appointed Sen. French (D), a former state prosecutor, to manage Branchflower. French is Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nAs a result of the announcement of a legislative investigation, Talis Colberg, the Alaskan Attorney General, and his Department of Law, began conducting an inquiry in late July at the request of the Governor. Rep. Ramras (R), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, criticized the Colberg probe. \"I think it is harmful to the credibility of the administration, harmful to the process and harmful to all the parties involved … it's just the worst possible thing to be doing.\" Ramras said Colberg \"needs to be very careful to avoid his review having any appearance of tampering with witnesses.\" The findings of the review were made public on August 13.\n\nThe inquiry identified two dozen contacts by members of Palin's staff with public safety officials, concerning Wooten. Of these, only one was determined to be improper by the Attorney General's office. Palin said that she had only known about some of the two dozen contacts, and that she never asked anyone on her staff to get in touch with such officials about Wooten. Additionally, the Governor said that, \"Many of these inquiries were completely appropriate. However, the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure, presumably at my direction.\"\n\nIn July, Palin had denied that there had been any pressure on Monegan to fire Wooten, either from herself or from anyone in her administration. Based on the Attorney General's inquiry, she said on August 13 that \"I do now have to tell Alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although I have only now become aware of it.\"\n\nPalin said the \"most disturbing\" contact found in the inquiry by the Attorney General and his office was the February 2008 phone call by Bailey to Dial. In a newspaper interview the day after the tape was released, Palin said she never asked Bailey to make the call, which she called \"just wrong.\" She also denied that the tape showed the administration applying pressure to fire Wooten, saying \"[i]f that's pressure, then (after) years in law enforcement, how do they do their job if that's perceived as pressure?\" A day or two earlier, Palin had said that Bailey's call appeared as a form of pressure: \"It appears that he, though, tried to apply some pressure on my behalf.\"\n\nOn August 19, the Governor's office announced that Bailey had been placed on paid leave, pending the outcome of the legislative investigation. Sharon Leighow, a spokesperson for the governor, said that Bailey was kept on the state payroll so Palin \"can direct him to assist Mr. Branchflower, thereby fulfilling her pledge to Alaskans to cooperate fully with the investigation.\"\n\nOn August 16, Hollis French said that the Palin administration has been cooperating and that subpoenas would not be necessary. In late August, French said that Palin was likely to be deposed soon in the case.\n\nIn mid-August, Palin hired a private practice lawyer, Thomas Van Flein, to defend her and her staff in the investigation; he began working on August 21. Van Flein was being paid by the State of Alaska; Attorney General Colberg was unable to represent Palin because of his involvement in the case. On August 29, Van Flein asked for all witness statements, documents and other materials collected in the course of the legislative investigation. French said, in response, that he had instructed Branchflower not to provide the letters or witness statements. On September 17, Van Flein said that he had, as of September 12, terminated his contract with the state, and was representing Todd and Sarah Palin personally. Van Flein said that the state would not be billed for any of his services since he was hired in August. Van Flein said that, after listening to Colberg's interview with Branchflower, he believes that Colberg is not a \"material witness.\"\n\nBranchflower's 3-month contract that started on August 1 was originally scheduled to end on October 31, and therefore the investigation was expected to end on that date. On September 2, French said the report would \"likely to be damaging to the (Palin) administration,\" and could be an October surprise. In response to French's statements, Republican state Senator John Coghill launched an unsuccessful attempt to have French removed from overseeing the investigation, and suggested the entire investigation ought to be canceled, saying \"if this has been botched up the way it has, there's a question as to whether it should continue.\" French apologized: \"I made some remarks I should not have made. The point to remember is I'm not doing the investigation, Steven Branchflower is. He is independently gathering the facts and he will issue the report, which he will have to defend.\"\n\nOn September 5 French said that rather than ending on October 31, the Friday before the election, the report would be complete by October 10. House Judiciary Chairman Ramras (R) said the reason for the earlier completion date for the report is to avoid the appearance of a last-minute \"October surprise.\" Other Republican lawmakers also expressed support for the earlier date.\n\nFrench's \"October surprise\" remarks were used, in part, as the basis for a lawsuit that was brought by five Republican lawmakers, in an attempt to stop the Branchflower investigation. On October 2, Superior Court Judge Peter Michalski rejected this lawsuit, and defended French's right to make those remarks: \"It is expected that legislators will belong to some party and will support the positions of their party, often publicly. The legislature is, by its nature, a political branch. It would be assumed that, e.g., review of Wall Street's financiers might be founded on a strongly held and expressed belief that somebody did something wrong.\"\n\nOn September 1, French said the legislature would pay to fly Branchflower to wherever Sarah Palin was on the campaign trail if needed, and that Branchflower had not yet been able to set up an interview with Palin. In a letter on September 1, Van Flein indicated that Palin probably would not agree to an interview unless the legislature turned the matter over to the Personnel Board. If witnesses were not available, French said, he would ask the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he chairs, to issue subpoenas. He said that Palin needed to be interviewed sometime in September.\n\nOn September 2, the lawyer for Frank Bailey, the aide Palin suspended after a recording of his call to a trooper official came to light, canceled a deposition scheduled for September 3. The lawyer said that Van Flein, who represents Palin, informed him that there was a jurisdictional dispute that was unsettled. Bailey's lawyer also said that Bailey was ready to be deposed, and that Bailey would say that he wasn't asked by the Governor to make any calls regarding Monegan, but that the jurisdictional matter should be settled first. In response to this, Rep. Ramras (R), chair of the House Judiciary Committee, said \"Alaskans should be offended, that Frank Bailey is on paid leave and will not do an interview that he already committed to with Mr. Branchflower.\"\n\nOn September 9, Senior Assistant Attorney General Mike Barnhill wrote to Legislative Council chair Sen. Kim Elton threatening to go to court to confirm that it was legal for the Governor to assign her staff to review personnel files. He said that, if the lawmakers agreed that this interpretation of the law was correct, the Attorney General's office \"will drop its objections [to state employees testifying] and the depositions may proceed without subpoenas.\" On September 12, Sen. Elton agreed with Barnhill's proposal, writing that \"I stipulate in my role as a chair of the Legislative Council and on behalf of the council that your interpretation of the law is correct.\"\n\nOn September 12, the Alaska Senate Judiciary Committee issued subpoenas to thirteen potential witnesses: Todd Palin, Ivy Frye, Randy Ruaro, Frank Bailey, John Bitney, Annette Kreitzer, Dianne Kiesel, Nicki Neal, Brad Thompson, Michael Nizich, Kris Perry, Janice Mason, and Murlene Wilkes. The Committee also authorized a subpoena for Bailey's cell-phone records.\n\nAccording to Branchflower, Wilkes may have lied to him during an earlier interview, and may have had a financial incentive to cover up being pressured by the Palins to deny Wooten's worker's compensation claim. Branchflower said an employee at Wilkes' company had called a tip line and said \"the governor's office wanted this claim denied.\" According to KTUU, \"knowingly denying a worker's comp claim for false reasons is a criminal offense.\" Sarah Palin herself was not subpoenaed: Ramras said that it \"would be disrespectful\" for the committee to subpoena the governor while she was running for Vice President. The Alaska Senate Judiciary Committee, which voted to issue the subpoenas, is composed of three Republicans and two Democrats. The vote was 3-2. The subpoenas were authorized at a joint meeting of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The House Judiciary Committee also voted, in an advisory capacity, in favor of authorizing the subpoenas. This vote was 5-0. Those five include three Republicans and two Democrats. Two Republican members of the House Judiciary Committee were not present.\n\nOn September 16, saying that the investigation was \"tainted\" by manipulations from Barack Obama's supporters, a McCain-Palin spokesperson said that Palin would not cooperate with the investigator hired by the legislature. The Obama campaign said that the claim of manipulation was \"complete paranoia.\"\n\nOn September 16, State Attorney General Talis Colberg, a Palin appointee, notified the Legislature that state employees would disobey the subpoenas issued in the course of the investigation, unless either the full Senate or the legislature as a whole voted to compel their testimony. He stated that the officials were \"loyal employees subject to the supervision of the Governor\" and cited Governor Palin's decision not to co-operate with the inquiry, her statement that the subpoenas were \"of questionable validity,\" and the pending lawsuits challenging the investigation. He added that the employees were in \"an untenable situation.\" The full Alaska legislature is not scheduled to convene until January 2009: it could not meet earlier unless a Special Session is called by Governor Palin.\n\nIn response to Attorney General Colberg's letter, Sen. Elton accused the administration of breaking an earlier agreement to allow the employees to testify. He cited several public statements by Palin or her staff pledging her cooperation, in addition to what he called the \"explicit\" offer in the earlier letter of September 9 to allow the testimony, provided that the administration's interpretation of the State Personnel Act was agreed upon.\n\nAlso on September 16, five GOP lawmakers from the Alaskan State Legislature filed a lawsuit in Anchorage Superior Court to end the investigation, claiming it was \"unlawful, biased, partial and partisan.\"\n\nOn September 18, the McCain/Palin campaign announced that Todd Palin would refuse to testify because he does not believe the investigation is legitimate. State senator Bill Wielechowski said that the witnesses could not be punished for disobeying the subpoenas until the full legislature comes into session, which was scheduled to be in January 2009.\n\nAs evidence of her claim that the Branchflower investigation was \"tainted,\" McCain spokesperson Stapleton cited the removal of former Palin Chief of Staff Tibbles from the subpoena list compiled by Branchflower. Branchflower had requested a subpoena for Tibbles because Tibbles was refusing to cooperate voluntarily. Stapleton said \"French's further political involvement was accidentally revealed when the investigator testified that he had deferred to French on the proper witnesses to subpoena.\" On October 1, the McCain campaign said \"Branchflower and French were recently exposed for colluding on the issuing of subpoenas.\" The McCain campaign also said \"in a hearing, Branchflower admits conspiring with French regarding the recipients of subpoenas.\"\n\nAccording to House Judiciary Chairman Ramras (R), it was his idea to remove Tibbles from the list: \"we did not want to put that onus -- at least this was the point of view I put forward -- I did not want to put that onus on somebody who is now excluded from state service and would not enjoy the same legal protection that has been afforded to those members of the administration.\"\n\nIn response to charges that the Branchflower investigation is partisan, Ramras stated that the Chairmen and Vice Chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees comprise three Republicans and one Democrat. All those four voted in favor of authorizing Branchflower's subpoenas. Ramras also mentioned \"I have had a McCain sign in my front yard since August 21st, as soon as they hit town in Fairbanks.\" Responding to further claims of partisanship, Ramras said \"the hyperbole from the truth squad [McCain campaign] is a little farfetched … to those of us who have monitored this thing from the front-row seats, it's a misnomer.\"\n\nSubpoenas were authorized at a joint meeting of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees on September 12. Branchflower was present, and reported on the interim progress of his month-long investigation. As of September 12, Branchflower had identified 33 potential witnesses, and had taken statements from 16 witnesses. He was also working with a large amount of material that had been produced by the Colberg investigation, and turned over to him.\n\nBranchflower said there was enough evidence in the public record to support the claim that Todd Palin was the principal critic of Trooper Wooten. Todd Palin had many contacts with DPS personnel over the last several years and made many comments about how it appeared that DPS was not doing its job because of Wooten; he wanted Wooten fired. Branchflower described Monegan's account of his meeting with Todd Palin in January 2007. Palin said Wooten's suspension was inadequate. In a legal filing in September 2008, Sarah Palin said her family didn't learn until July 2008 that Wooten had been disciplined with a suspension in 2006.\n\nOn September 19, French issued a letter detailing the status of the thirteen witness subpoenas authorized by the Senate Judiciary Committee on September 12. As of the 19th, six of the subpoenas had been served, to Todd Palin, Ivy Frye, Ruaro, Bailey, Bitney and Wilkes. The former three failed to appear on September 19, as ordered. The latter three complied with the subpoena by providing statements to Branchflower. The cell-phone company also was served and complied by providing Bailey's records.\n\nOn September 19, French announced that Branchflower would serve subpoenas on the seven remaining witnesses (Kiesel, Kreitzer, Neal, Thompson, Nizich, Perry, and Mason), with a return date of September 26.\n\nFrench's letter noted that Attorney General Colberg's office had confirmed twice, in writing, that witnesses would cooperate. Colberg cancelled that cooperation agreement on September 16. French said that various subpoenas would have been served earlier, but Branchflower had been relying on assurances that had been given by the Governor and others that witnesses would be instructed to cooperate.\n\nOn October 2, Superior Court Judge Peter Michalski rejected the contentions of the five Republican state legislators who had sued to block the investigation, and he also rejected Colberg's challenge to the subpoenas. In response, Colberg declined to discuss whether he would advise the subpoenaed state officials to comply with the subpoenas; he stated instead that he would need to consult with them about a possible appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court before commenting publicly.\n\nOn October 5, seven of the witnesses agreed that they would testify, leaving only the Palins' own appearance in doubt.\n\nThe Alaska Legislative Council investigation concluded on October 10, 2008. After a full day of deliberation, the twelve members of the legislative commission voted unanimously to release, without endorsing, the 263-page Branchflower Report. The report included four main findings:\n\n\nThe report concludes that Palin wrongfully allowed her husband, Todd Palin, to use state resources to pursue having Trooper Wooten fired, stating that \"Palin knowingly permitted a situation to continue where impermissible pressure was placed on several subordinates in order to advance a personal agenda...\"\n\nThe report also recommended some clarifications of ethics statutes for the future. The third finding relates to evidence that Alaskan officials had informed the owner of the firm handling Wooten's worker's compensation claim that the governor wanted Wooten's claim denied. However, the report finds that the claim was handled without regard to any attempt at political pressure. The report did not recommend any sanctions or legal penalties.\n\nPalin's attorney issued a five-page statement condemning the Branchflower report as misleading and wrong on the law. Palin responded to the report by saying, \"About the Tasergate issue... I'm very very pleased to be cleared of any legal wrongdoing, any hint of any kind of unethical activity there.\" This statement was criticized as inconsistent with the contents of the report by the media and by Democratic state senator Kim Elton.\n\nOn September 1, Palin essentially filed an ethics complaint against herself, asking the state Personnel Board to review the case. Her lawyer asked the state legislature to drop its investigation, saying that by state law, the board had jurisdiction over ethics issues. Palin also asked that the board review the matter as an ethics complaint.\n\nThe Personnel Board is a three-member panel appointed by the governor, and confirmed by the legislature. Members serve six-year terms, and not more than two members may be of same political party. The three people on the current board were first appointed by Frank Murkowski (R), Palin's gubernatorial predecessor; Palin reappointed one member in 2008. Another member donated $400 to Palin's 2006 campaign for governor. As governor, Palin has the authority to remove members of the board, for cause. The Personnel Board hired Anchorage trial lawyer Timothy J. Petumenos, a registered Democrat who contributed to Palin's opponent for governor in 2006, as its investigator. In 2002, his firm handled the $15 million bond issue for Wasilla's hockey complex, a pet project of then-mayor Palin.\n\nIn response to the request from Palin's attorney, French responded that \"We're going to proceed. If they want to proceed, that's perfectly within their right but it doesn't diminish our right to do so.\"\n\nOn September 3, Nicki Neal, director of the state Division of Personnel and Labor Relations, said that the board would meet soon in executive session—closed to the public—to begin its work. Palin had asked for the ethics case to be open. Neal said she would check into how that relates to the board meetings. Neal is one of the persons listed as a potential witness in the Branchflower investigation.\n\nOn September 15, 2008, Palin's attorney Van Flein filed arguments with the Personnel Board arguing that there was \"no probable cause\" to pursue the complaint that Palin earlier filed against herself. The filing accused Monegan of \"an escalating pattern of insubordination on budget and other key policy issues\", including a press conference appearance with Senator French, who is leading the legislature's investigation. Van Flein also argued that, even if Palin had ordered Monegan to fire Wooten, that would not violate Alaska's Ethics Act \"because the public generally shares a common interest in public order and safety.\"\n\nThe September 15 filing said that a key matter was a planned trip to Washington, D.C. by Monegan to seek funding for an initiative against sexual assault. The filing said that \"the proposed Washington trip proved to be the last straw\", and that she had not authorized the trip. On April 28, 2008, Palin had praised Monegan for his work in this area (sexual assault and domestic violence).\n\nOn September 19, \"ABC News\" reported that the governor's staff had authorized Monegan's trip, scheduled for July 22, 2008. ABC posted a travel authorization, signed by Nizich, Palin's Chief of Staff, on June 19, 2008, for the trip.\n\nIn response to inquiries about the travel authorization, the McCain-Palin campaign provided a statement on September 19 from Ruaro, the governor's deputy chief of staff as of September 1, 2008. Ruaro wrote that Monegan asked for—and received—approval for the travel without telling Palin's staff his reason for going. '\"As a matter of routine, the travel was approved by Mike Nizich ... weeks before the actual purpose was made clear by former Commissioner Monegan,'\" Ruaro wrote. On September 20, the McCain campaign said \"Gov. Palin's chief of staff authorized Monegan to travel to Washington … weeks before Monegan revealed the true purpose of his trip.\"\n\nHowever, the September 15 legal filing contained a related e-mail: on June 26, 2008, Randy Ruaro, at that time a special assistant to the governor, emailed Karen Rehfeld, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, with a copy to Nizich. The email began \"Walt and DPS want to make a trip back to DC in the end of July ... to get funding ... for work on sexual assault cases.\"\n\nOn October 13, 2008, Monegan asked the State Personnel Board for a hearing at which he could defend himself against Palin's accusations. Monegan's \"Request for Due Process Hearing To Address Reputational Harm\" set forth Palin's explanations for having dismissed him. It also stated:\nLike all cabinet officers, Mr. Monegan served at the pleasure of the Governor and she could terminate him for any just reason or for no reason at all. But the Governor is not entitled to make untrue and defamatory statements about her reasons for discharging a cabinet officer. Governor Palin's public statements accusing Mr. Monegan of serious misconduct were untrue and they have stigmatized his good name, severely damaged – and continue to damage – his reputation, and impaired his ability to pursue future professional employment in law enforcement and related fields.\n\nThe Palins' attorney, Thomas Van Flein, stated that Palin and her husband would both give depositions on October 24 afternoon outside the state. As part of the Alaska Personnel Board investigation, with hired independent counsel Timothy Petumenos, each interview was expected to take up to 3 hours.\n\nOn September 3, the police union filed an ethics complaint with the Alaska Attorney General's office. The complaint alleged that Palin and her officials had illegally accessed and disclosed information from Wooten's confidential personnel records. It said that the call by Frank Bailey, particularly the allegation that Wooten had lied on his job application, demonstrated knowledge that could only have come from Wooten's private file.\nDuring the February 29, 2008, call, which was recorded, Lt. Dial asked Bailey how he had come across this \"extremely confidential\" information, and Bailey replied \"I'm a little bit reluctant to say. Over in admin is where, you know, we hold workers' comp right in there.\"\n\nThe McCain-Palin campaign responded to the September 3 ethics complaint by saying that the privacy had been waived as part of the Wooten divorce proceedings, putting the information in the public domain, and that Bailey had received the information from Todd Palin, not from Wooten's personnel records, following Wooten's release on February 7, 2008 of his entire personnel file (\"including all disciplinary action(s)\") to his ex-wife's attorneys.\n\nOn November 3, 2008, the Alaska Personnel Board concluded its probe and determined that Palin had not violated ethics laws, contradicting the earlier investigations. Tim Petumenos, the lawyer hired by the board to conduct the probe, was quoted as stating in his final report, \"There is no probable cause to believe that the governor, or any other state official, violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act in connection with these matters.\" The Personnel Board report also dismissed Monegan's request for a hearing and recommended that the police union's (PSEA) amended complaint be dismissed. The summary and recommendations of the Petumenos report are as follows:\n\nSUMMARY OF PUBLIC FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n1. There is no probable cause to believe that Governor Palin violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act by making the decision to dismiss Department of Public Safety Commissioner Monegan and offering him instead the position of Director of the Alcohol Beverage Control Board.\n\n2. There is no probable cause to believe that Governor Palin violated the Alaska Executive Ethics Act in any other respect in connection with the employment of Alaska State Trooper Michael Wooten.\n\n3. There is no basis upon which to refer the conduct of Governor Palin to any law enforcement agency in connection with this matter because Governor Palin did not commit the offenses of Interference with Official Proceedings or Official Misconduct.\n\n4. There is no probable cause to believe that any other official of state government violated any substantive provision of the Ethics Act.\n\n5. There is no legal basis or jurisdiction for conducting a \"Due Process Hearing to Address Reputational Harm\" as requested by former Commissioner Walter Monegan.\n\n6. The Amended Complaint by the PSEA should be dismissed.\n\n7. Independent Counsel recommends that the appropriate agency of State government address the issue of the private use of e-mails for government work and revisit the record retention policies of the Governor's Office.\n\nThese findings differ from those of the Branchflower Report because Independent Counsel has concluded the wrong statute was used as a basis for the conclusions contained in the Branchflower Report. The Branchflower Report misconstrued the available evidence and did not consider or obtain all of the material evidence that is required to properly reach findings in this matter.\n\nIn early December, Palin's deputy press secretary said that the board's report had been released because Palin had waived her confidentiality to release it, but that Palin would not release a transcript of her testimony on October 24. The governor's office also refused to release a transcript of Todd Palin's deposition and other key documents that were part of the Personnel Board investigation but not included as attachments to the official report.\n\nPalin has made a number of statements expressing her views on the proper venue for the investigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPalin replaced Monegan with Chuck Kopp, who had been the police chief and, for a time, the acting city manager, of Kenai. She had previously nominated Kopp in March 2007 to the Alaska Judicial Council, to which he was later confirmed. (He resigned on July 13, 2008.) The Alaska Judicial Council recommends judges for selection in the state. According to the \"Anchorage Daily News\", Kopp \"was a rising star in Alaska's Christian conservative movement.\" In Kenai, Kopp had been previously suspended and investigated for sexual harassment of an employee. Palin said she believed, when she named him on July 11, that the investigation had cleared him, and that she learned that Kopp had received a letter of reprimand only when Kopp held a press conference on July 22 to discuss that letter. Kopp resigned on July 25. He received a $10,000 severance payment. Monegan had received no severance payment.\n\nAlthough certain reports indicate that Kopp was appointed on July 11, the actual announcement from Palin's office is dated July 14. The person who was sexually harassed by Kopp sent an email to Palin on July 14, 2008, very early in the morning before Palin made her announcement. The victim said \"my sexual harassment complaint against Chief Kopp was acknowledged [and] validated … by the City of Kenai.\" In a letter to the victim on October 10, 2005, the City of Kenai had said this: \"As a result of our investigation, Chuck Kopp was removed immediately from his supervisory role relating to your position. … The City of Kenai will not tolerate harassment of its employees from anyone, regardless of his or her position.\" Palin later stated that when she appointed Kopp, she was unaware that he had been reprimanded.\n\nOn September 12, 2008 Palin appointed Joseph Masters as the third Public Safety Commissioner in a two-month period. Masters, a former deputy director of the Alaska State Troopers, had been security director for petrochemical operations for a private company. He replaced John Glass, who had served as acting commissioner. The \"Anchorage Daily News\" reported: \"Asked if the governor discussed her vision of the department with him, [Masters] said, 'Gov. Palin didn't give me any guidance or direction or mandates for the department.'\"\n\nAs of mid-September 2008, the post of director of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (the alternative job which Palin had offered to Monegan) was unfilled.\n\nIn a number of instances, certain facts appear to be described in an inconsistent manner, when comparing multiple sources:\n\nAccording to the memorandum of findings and the suspension letter, there was no finding that Wooten ever committed any act of violence against any person, other than the Taser incident. According to a police statement, McCann told police that Wooten never abused her. According to a police statement, the DVPO was dissolved because there was no evidence of violence.\n\nAccording to various statements by Palin et al., Wooten is violent and abusive. Various statements reference the DVPO as proof that Wooten is violent. In a sworn statement, Todd Palin accused Wooten of \"violent behavior\" directed at four family members. On September 2, 2008 Palin said that Wooten was guilty of \"violent behavior … directed against … my sister.\" On September 17 McCain-Palin spokesperson Meg Stapleton said Wooten \"abused her [Palin's] sister.\" On October 9 Stapleton said \"there are numerous instances of abuse.\" On October 10 the McCain campaign accused Wooten of \"violent behavior\" directed at four family members in 2005 and early 2006.\n\nAccording to the Memorandum of Findings and the suspension letter, there was no finding that Wooten ever made any threat of violence against any person, other than Heath. The alleged threat against Heath was witnessed by no one outside the family. The suspension letter did not mention that threat. Another alleged threat, to \"bring down\" Sarah and her family, was witnessed only by McCann, and she stated that she understood it was not a threat of violence, but rather a threat \"to make life difficult\" for them.\n\nAccording to various statements by Palin et al., Wooten has made violent threats against various other members of her family, aside from Heath. For example, on September 15, 2008, Palin said Wooten had made \"threats of violence\" against McCann and Palin's nephew.\n\nIn September 2008, Palin described Wooten as \"a trooper who is making threats against the First Family.\" On September 18 she again mentioned \"his threats against the First Family.\" This seems to indicate that Wooten has made threats subsequent to the time that Palin became governor. However, Palin's September 2008 legal filings do not detail any threats that took place after Palin became governor, or at any time since April 11, 2005, when the divorce was filed. Palin's filing on September 1, 2008 said \"no one in the Palin family ever filed a formal complaint,\" subsequent to the complaints the family made in 2005.\n\nBranchflower said \"Palin has stated publicly that she and her family feared Trooper Wooten. Yet the evidence presented has been inconsistent with such claims of fear … she ordered a substantial reduction in manpower in her personal protection detail …, an act that is inconsistent with a desire to avoid harm from Trooper Wooten … [Palin's] claims of fear were not bona fide and were offered to provide cover for the Palins' real motivation: to get Trooper Wooten fired for personal family related reasons.\"\n\nBranchflower wrote that in their first meeting with their security detail, the Palins were specifically asked if they knew of any threats against them. \"They basically said no.\"\n\nAccording to the DVPO document itself, the DVPO was temporary, with a nominal 20-day duration. It was issued presumptively on April 11, 2005, based on allegations made by McCann that day, in her written application. The DVPO document indicates that a hearing would be held to determine whether or not the temporary order should be extended into a long-term protective order. That hearing was originally scheduled for April 27 but actually took place on May 9. According to a police statement, the DVPO was dissolved at the May 9 hearing because McCann could not present evidence of violence.\n\nOn September 2, 2008, Palin said \"the Anchorage Superior Court [had found] that [Wooten] had engaged in serious, violent misconduct.\" According to a sworn statement by Todd Palin, the DVPO extended into 2006. On September 16, 2008, the McCain campaign said\n\"he [Wooten] is the subject of a Domestic Violence Protective Order\", suggesting that the DVPO was still in effect. On October 10, 2008, the McCain campaign said Wooten was the subject of a DVPO \"in 2005 and early 2006\".\n\nAccording to Palin, she and her family were unaware, prior to July 2008, that Wooten had been disciplined in 2006. For example, on September 1, 2008 Palin said that \"Monegan never told Governor Palin or Todd about the discipline that Wooten received ... the parties involved had no idea how the matter was resolved ... As far as the Palin family knew [as of July 2008], Wooten ... had escaped discipline.\" In a sworn statement on October 8, 2008, Todd Palin said \"the DPS never informed me or my wife that Wooten had been disciplined.\"\n\nAccording to the Branchflower Report, Sarah Palin was aware that Wooten had been disciplined. Branchflower said Palin was \"apparently intent upon getting Trooper Wooten fired in spite of the fact she knew he had been disciplined following the Administrative Investigation.\" In a sworn deposition, Monegan said that he did \"mention [to Sarah Palin] that the discipline had already been imposed on Mr. Wooten during the previous administration following an administrative investigation and that the matter was closed.\" Branchflower reports that Monegan \"told Mr. Palin that the matter had been investigated, that discipline had been imposed.\"\n\nThe Branchflower Report includes testimony by John Glass, Deputy Commissioner of Public Safety, who testified that he told Todd Palin \"that Wooten had already been penalized for his actions that he had taken.\" Glass testified that he gave the same information to Frank Bailey, Palin's director of boards and commissions. Glass told Bailey that \"he should just leave the matter alone since Wooten disciplinary proceeding had already taken and that discipline had already been imposed and the matter was closed.\"\n\nAccording to a statement by police, the DVPO was dissolved because McCann showed no evidence that Wooten was violent.\n\nAccording to Palin, the DVPO was dissolved because Wooten's superiors intervened. According to Palin, the police investigation was \"negligently or deliberately slipshod … investigators seemed more concerned about exonerating Wooten than protecting public safety or the Palin family.\"\n\nAccording to the police union ethics complaint, Bailey had improper access to confidential information from Wooten's personnel file. Palin responded by stating that Todd Palin had this information because Wooten had signed a release placing his entire personnel file in the public domain. However, Palin has also claimed that her family was not aware of Wooten's suspension until July 2008. Also, Wooten's release of February 7, 2008, did not place his file in the public domain, it only released his file to McCann's attorneys in connection with the divorce proceedings.\n\nAccording to the suspension letter issued by Col. Grimes, there had been three disciplinary actions against Wooten: a warning, a reprimand, and an Instruction, for such things as \"not using turn signals\", in the period prior to April 11, 2005, the date when the divorce was filed and a Domestic Violence Protective Order was issued.\n\nAccording to Palin, \"Wooten had been disciplined a dozen times before he was the subject of a Domestic Violence Protective Order from Molly McCann.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12383290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12383290", "title": "Anti-tank dog", "text": "Anti-tank dog\n\nAnti-tank dogs ( \"sobaki-istrebiteli tankov\" or \"protivotankovye sobaki\"; or \"Hundeminen\", \"dog-mines\") were dogs taught to carry explosives to tanks, armored vehicles and other military targets. They were intensively trained by the Soviet and Russian military forces between 1930 and 1996 and used in 1941–1942 against German tanks in World War II. Although the original dog training routine was to leave the bomb and retreat so that the bomb would be detonated by the timer, this routine failed and was replaced by an impact detonation procedure which killed the dog in the process. The U.S. military trained anti-tank dogs in 1943 for use against fortifications, but never deployed them. Dogs strapped with explosives were unsuccessfully used by Iraqi insurgents in the 2000s.\n\nIn 1924, the Revolutionary Military Council of the Soviet Union approved the use of dogs for military purposes, which included a wide range of tasks such as rescue, delivery of first aid, communication, tracking mines and people, assisting in combat, transporting food, medicine and injured soldiers on sleds, and destruction of enemy targets. For these purposes, a specialized dog training school was founded in the Moscow Oblast. Twelve regional schools were opened soon after, three of which trained anti-tank dogs.\n\nThe Soviet Army had no dedicated dog trainers, therefore they recruited hunting, police, and even circus trainers. Several leading animal scientists were also involved, in order to help organize a wide-scale training program. German Shepherd Dogs were favored for the program for their physical abilities and ease of training, but other breeds were used as well. The idea of using dogs as mobile mines was developed in the 1930s, together with the dog-fitting mine design. In 1935, anti-tank dog units were officially included in the Soviet Army.\n\nThe original idea was for a dog to carry a bomb strapped to its body, and reach a specific static target. The dog would then release the bomb by pulling with its teeth a self-releasing belt and return to the operator. The bomb could then be detonated either by a timer or remote control, though the latter was too rare and expensive at the time to be used. A group of dogs practiced this for six months, but the reports show that no dogs could master the task. They performed well on a single target but became confused after the target or location was changed and often returned to the operator with the bomb unreleased, which in a live situation would have killed both the dog and the operator.\n\nContinual failures brought about a simplification. The bomb was fastened on the dog and detonated upon contact with the target, killing the animal. Whereas in the first program, the dog was trained to locate a specific target, this task was simplified to find any enemy tank. Dogs were trained by being kept hungry and their food was placed under tanks. The tanks were at first left standing still, then they had their engines running, which was further combined with sporadic blank-shot gunfire and other battle-related distractions. This routine aimed to teach the dogs to run under the tanks in battlefield situations.\n\nEach dog was fitted with a mine carried in two canvas pouches adjusted individually to each dog. The mine had a safety pin which was removed right before the deployment; each mine carried no markings and was not supposed to be disarmed. A wooden lever extended out of a pouch to about in height. When the dog dived under the tank, the lever struck the bottom of the tank and detonated the charge. Because the underparts of the chassis were the most vulnerable area of these vehicles, it was hoped the explosion would disable the vehicle.\n\nThe use of anti-tank dogs was escalated during 1941–1942, when every effort was made by the Soviet Army to stop the German advance at the Eastern Front of World War II. In that period, the dog training schools were mostly focused on producing anti-tank dogs. About 40,000 dogs were deployed for various tasks in the Soviet Army.\n\nThe first group of anti-tank dogs arrived at the frontline at the end of the summer of 1941 and included 30 dogs and 40 trainers. Their deployment revealed some serious problems. In order to save fuel and ammunition, dogs had been trained on tanks which stood still and did not fire their guns. In the field, the dogs refused to dive under moving tanks. Some persistent dogs ran near the tanks, waiting for them to stop but were shot in the process. Gunfire from the tanks scared away many of the dogs. They would run back to the trenches and often detonated the charge upon jumping in, killing Soviet soldiers. To prevent that, the returning dogs had to be shot, often by their controllers and this made the trainers unwilling to work with new dogs. Some went so far as to say that the army did not stop with sacrificing people to the war and went on to slaughter dogs too; those who openly criticized the program were persecuted by \"special departments\" (military counterintelligence). Out of the first group of 30 dogs, only four managed to detonate their bombs near the German tanks, inflicting an unknown amount of damage. Six exploded upon returning to the Soviet trenches, killing and injuring soldiers. Three dogs were shot by German troops and taken away, despite furious attempts by the Soviets to prevent this, which provided examples of the detonation mechanism to the Germans. A captured German officer later reported that they learned of the anti-tank dog design from the killed animals, and considered the program desperate and inefficient. A German propaganda campaign sought to discredit the Soviet Army, saying that Soviet soldiers refuse to fight and send dogs instead.\n\nAnother serious training mistake was revealed later; the Soviets used their own diesel-engine tanks to train the dogs rather than German tanks which had gasoline engines. As the dogs relied on their acute sense of smell, the dogs sought out familiar Soviet tanks instead of strange-smelling German tanks.\n\nThe efficiency of using anti-tank dogs in World War II remains uncertain. There are claims by the Soviet sources that around 300 German tanks were damaged by Soviet anti-tank dogs. This claim was questioned by Russian historians as propaganda, trying to justify the dog training program. There are however documented claims of individual successes of the program, with the number of damaged tanks usually being within a dozen. For example, at the front of the 160th Infantry Division near Hlukhiv, six dogs had damaged five German tanks; near the airport of Stalingrad, anti-tank dogs destroyed 13 tanks. At the Battle of Kursk, 16 dogs disabled 12 German tanks which had broken through the Soviet lines of defense near Tamarovka, Bykovo.\n\nThe German forces knew about the Soviet dogs from 1941 onwards, and so took measures to defend against them. An armored vehicle's top-mounted machine gun proved ineffective due to the relatively small size of the attackers as the dogs were too low to the ground and because of the dogs' speed and the difficulty in spotting them. Consequently, every German soldier received orders to shoot any dog in combat areas.\n\nThe hostility of German soldiers and officers to the dogs is mentioned in the semi-fictional novel \"Kaputt\" by Curzio Malaparte. As an Italian correspondent on the Eastern front during 1941–42, Malaparte recounted how one of the German soldiers' first tasks upon entering and occupying villages in Ukraine was to seek out and kill any dog on sight.\n\nAfter 1942, the use of anti-tank dogs by the Soviet Army rapidly declined, and training schools were redirected to producing the more needed mine-seeking and delivery dogs. However, training of anti-tank dogs continued after World War II, until June 1996.\n\nThe Japanese Army received about 25,000 dogs from their ally Germany and organized several dog training schools in Japan, and one in China at Nanjing. Some dogs were trained for demolition, but instead of strapping explosives to the dog, it was attached to dog-drawn carts. Their deployment had little success, mostly due to poor training. In the late 1940s, anti-tank dogs were used by the Viet Minh forces fighting in Indochina.\n\nIn 1943, U.S. forces considered using armed dogs against fortifications. The aim was for a dog to run into a bunker carrying a bomb, which would then be detonated by a timer. Dogs in this secret program were trained at Fort Belvoir. The dogs, called \"demolition wolves\", were taught to run to a bunker, enter it, and sit while waiting for a simulated explosion. Each dog carried a bomb strapped to its body in canvas pouches, as with the Russian method. The program was terminated on 17 December 1943 out of safety concerns. During the training, dogs often returned to the senders without entering the bunker or waiting there for supposed period of time which would have caused friendly casualties in a live fire situation. It was feared that in the actual battle, dogs would return much more often, scared by enemy fire. Attempts to continue the program in 1944 and 1945 failed.\n\nWilliam A. Prestre, a Swiss citizen living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, proposed using large dogs to kill Japanese soldiers. He convinced the military to lease an entire island in the Mississippi River to house the training facilities. There the army hoped to train as many as two million dogs. The idea was to begin island invasions with landing craft releasing thousands of dogs against the Japanese defenders, then followed up by troops as the Japanese defenders scattered in confusion. One of the biggest problems encountered was getting Japanese soldiers to train the dogs, as very few Japanese soldiers were being captured. Eventually, Japanese-American soldiers volunteered for the training. The biggest problem was the dogs, as they were either too docile, did not respond to training teaching them to rush across beaches, or were terrified by shellfire. After millions of dollars were spent, the program was abandoned.\n\nAround 2007, insurgents attempted to use bomb-equipped dogs during the Iraq War. Remote controls were used to detonate the bomb. In one documented incident in Iraq, the dog was detonated without inflicting damage. More often, donkeys were used, as they were more reliable. Donkeys are traditionally equipped with sacks and thus could carry a large explosive charge without looking suspicious.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20026241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20026241", "title": "Battle of Jinyang", "text": "Battle of Jinyang\n\nThe Battle of Jinyang () was fought between the elite families of the State of Jin, the house of Zhao and the house of Zhi (智), in the Spring and Autumn period of China. The other houses of Wei and Han first participated in the battle in alliance with the Zhi, but later defected to ally with Zhao to annihilate the Zhi house. This event was a catalyst to the Tripartition of Jin in 434 BC, the forming of the three states of Zhao, Wei, and Han, and the start to the Warring States period. It is the first battle described in the Song Dynasty history compendium \"Zizhi Tongjian\".\n\nBy 490 BC, after the destruction of the houses of Fan (范) and Zhonghang (中行), control of the State of Jin, then the largest state in China, was contested by four elite families: Zhi, Wei, Zhao, and Han. With multiple military victories under his belt, Zhi Yao (or Zhi Bo Yao 智伯瑤) of the house of Zhi exerted the most influence in the Jin court – all decisions of the state had to pass through him. He also controlled the most territory within the state. The reigning duke of Jin, Duke Ai, was powerless to restrain him. So Zhi Yao, in his pride, began to demand lands from the other three houses. The houses of Wei and Han reluctantly complied to evade Zhi's wrath, but Zhao Xiangzi (趙襄子) refused to cede the territories of Lin (藺) and Gaolang (皋狼), both in modern-day Lishi, to Zhi. Zhi, in retribution, formed a secret alliance with the houses of Wei and Han to attack Zhao.\n\nZhao Xiangzi suspected an attack from Zhi, since he has heard that Zhi sent envoys to Han and Wei three times, but never to Zhao. After rejecting suggestions to move to Zhangzi or Handan out of concern for the people there, Zhao Xiangzi asked his minister Zhang Mengtan (張孟談) where he could prepare his defence, and Zhang Mengtan suggested Jinyang because Jinyang had been well-governed for generations. Zhao agreed, and summoned Yanling Sheng (延陵生) to lead the army carriages and cavalry ahead to Jinyang, Zhao himself to follow later. Once in Jinyang, Zhao Xiangzi, following the suggestions of Zhang Mengtan, issued orders to refill the granaries and the treasuries, repair walls, make arrows, and melt copper pillars for metal. By virtue of past governance, the treasuries, granaries, and arsenals were filled within three days, and the walls repaired within five. Thus all of Jinyang was prepared for war.\n\nWhen the three armies of Zhi, Wei, and Han reached Jinyang in 455 BC, they laid siege to the city, but for three months they could not take the city. They fanned out and surrounded the city, and a year later diverted the flow of the Fen River to inundate the city. All buildings under three stories high were submerged, and the people of Jinyang were obliged to live in nest-like perches above the water and hang their kettles from the scaffolding in order to cook.\n\nBy the third year, supplies had run out for the Zhao, diseases broke out, and the populace were reduced to eating each other's children. Although the common people remained firm in the defence, the court ministers' loyalties began to waver. Zhao Xiangzi asked Zhang Mengtan, \"Our provisions are gone, our strength and resources are exhausted, the officials are starving and ill, and I fear we can hold out no longer. I am going to surrender the city, but to which of the three states should I surrender?\" Zhang Mengtan, much alarmed, persuaded Zhao not to surrender but instead send him out to negotiate with the houses of Wei and Han.\n\nThe houses of Wei and Han were promised an even split of Zhao's territories when the battle was won, however both the Wei and Han leaders were uneasy, since they understood that they too would be conquered if Zhao fell to Zhi. Zhi Yao's minister, Xi Ci (郤疵), warned Zhi that the two houses were going to revolt, since \"the men and horses [of Jinyang] are eating each other and the city is soon to fall, yet the lords of Han and Wei show no signs of joy but instead are worried. If those are not rebellious signs, then what are they?\" Zhi paid Xi Ci no heed, and instead told the lords of Han and Wei of Xi's suspicion. Xi, knowing that his warning fell to deaf ears, excused himself from the battlefield by going to the State of Qi as an envoy.\n\nIndeed, when Zhang Mengtan secretly met with Wei Huan-zi and Han Kangzi (韓康子), who confessed that they were secretly planning to mutiny against Zhi. The three discussed their plans and settled on a date to execute the plans. Zhang Mengtan returned to Jinyang to report back to Zhao Xiangzi, and Zhao, in joy and apprehension, bowed to Zhang several times as a sign of great reverence.\n\nOne of Zhi Yao's clansmen, Zhi Guo (智過), by happenstance, observed the leaders of Wei and Han after the secret meeting, and warned Zhi Yao of the possibility that they might rebel, judging by their lack of restraints like before. Zhi again chose to put his trust in his two allies, saying: \"Since I have been this good to them, they would surely not attack or deceive me. Our troops have invested Jinyang for three years. Now when the city is ready to fall at any moment and we are about to enjoy the spoils, what reason would they have for changing their minds?\" Zhi told Wei and Han what Zhi Guo said, and the two learnt to be cautious when they saw Zhi Guo the next day. Zhi Guo, seeing the change in their looks, insisted to Zhi Yao that the two ought to be executed. Zhi Yao would not hear of it, and Zhi Guo suggested another plan to buy their friendship: to bribe the influential ministers Zhao Jia (趙葭) of Wei and Duan Gui (段規) of Han with enfeoffment of the Zhao lands. Zhi Yao rejected the proposal because the Zhao lands were going to split in three already, and he did not want to receive less than one third of the eventual spoils. Since Zhi Yao would not listen, Zhi Guo left him and changed his surname to Fu (輔) as a precaution.\n\nHearing this, Zhang Mengtan urged Zhao Xiangzi to take action immediately, lest Zhi Yao changes his mind. Zhao then dispatched Zhang Mengtan to the camps of Wei and Han, alerting them of the time of the final attack. On the night of May 8, 453 BC, Zhao troops killed the men guarding the dams of the Fen River and let the river flood the Zhi armies. As the Zhi armies fell into chaos trying to stop the water, the Wei and Han armies attacked Zhi from the sides and Zhao led his soldiers in a frontal attack. Together they inflicted a severe defeat on Zhi Yao's army and took him prisoner.\n\nZhao Xiangzi had a grudge on Zhi Yao because Zhi had often humiliated him in the past, thus he executed Zhi and made his skull into a winecup. No one in the house of Zhi was spared except for Zhi Guo's family, who had already changed their surnames and fled. The territories of Zhi were evenly distributed among the three victors.\n\nWith the elimination of the Zhi house, control of the State of Jin fell to the remaining three families, their powers unchecked by anyone in the state. In 434 BC, following the death of Duke Ai, the three families annexed all of Jin's lands, leaving only the capital estates of Jiang and Quwo for the next duke of Jin. In 403 BC, the Wei, Zhao and Han lords all went to King Weilie of Zhou in Luoyang and were made marquises in their own right, establishing the three states of Zhao, Wei, and Han, ushering in the beginning of the Warring States period by Sima Guang's definition. Most historians, when referring to those three states, call them the \"Three Jins\" (三晉). The State of Jin continued to exist with a tiny piece of territory until 376 BC when the rest of the territory was partitioned by the Three Jins.\n\nThe Legalist thinker Han Feizi of the late Warring States period used this battle as an example of failure via greed and perversity, one of the \"Ten Faults\" that a ruler should not have. He reasoned that because Zhi Yao was too fond for profit, he opened himself to the destruction of the state and his own demise.\n\nThe Song Dynasty statesman Sima Guang, in his \"Zizhi Tongjian\", attribute Zhi Yao's failure to his lacking virtue compared to his talents, and thus invited disaster.\n\n"}

{"id": "51502087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51502087", "title": "Cajun Navy", "text": "Cajun Navy\n\nThe Cajun Navy are informal ad-hoc volunteer groups comprising private boat owners who assist in search and rescue efforts in Louisiana and adjacent areas. These groups were formed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and reactivated in the aftermaths of the 2016 Louisiana floods, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, the 2018 Hidalgo County flood, Hurricane Florence, Tropical Storm Gordon, and Hurricane Michael. They are credited with rescuing thousands of citizens during those disasters.\n\nThese groups draw their name from the region's Cajun people, a significant number of whom are private boat owners and skilled boat pilots. Their boats consist of a number of types, but are typically small vessels such as bass boats, jonboats, air boats, and other small, shallow-draft craft easily transported to flooded areas.\n\nThe term \"Cajun Navy\" had earlier, unrelated jovial origins before it evolved into its current usage. The earliest documented use of the term occurred in 1964 when outgoing governor Jimmie Davis received \"a commission as a commodore in the Cajun Navy plus a four-star pirogue for his personal use\" as a going-away gift by the Greater Lafourche Port Commission. It was also used in 1995 by a sub-krewe of the Krewe of Denham Springs as part of the krewe's Mardi Gras parade theme of \"And Away We Go.\" Contemporary usage appears to have been coined in 2005 to describe private boaters who served as volunteer rescuers in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina; it was apparently used as such by then-Tulane University history professor Douglas Brinkley in a speech, as cited in the Baton Rouge \"Advocate\":\n\nThe term received more currency in 2015, the tenth anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, when commemorative articles in the media referred to the loose organization of south Louisiana boaters. CBS News, for example, reported that year, \"Hurricane Katrina killed an estimated 1,800 people, but it could have been far worse if not for what became known as 'The Cajun Navy.' Hundreds of people in hundreds of boats gathered in Lafayette, Louisiana, to rescue thousands trapped by floodwaters...\"\n\nFormer Louisiana state senator Nick Gautreaux put out a plea across local television and radio for \"Anybody [who] wants to go help the people of New Orleans please come to the Acadiana Mall.\" Between 350 and 400 boats and people showed up. This makeshift flotilla that became known as the Cajun Navy is credited with rescuing more than 10,000 people from flooded homes and rooftops.\n\nIn 2016, major flooding struck south-central Louisiana, resulting in even more attention for the informal rescue organization. \"[M]akeshift flotillas popped up across the region over the weekend,\" observed \"USA Today\" during the disaster. \"Many are operating under a name familiar in Louisiana: the Cajun Navy.\" \"Fortune\" magazine noted, \"In the midst of one of the most severe (yet least-reported) natural disasters in recent history, a homegrown volunteer rescue squad known as the Cajun Navy is providing badly needed relief in flood-ravaged Louisiana.\" The Baton Rouge \"Advocate\" summed up the feelings of many when it wrote: \"The heroes hailed from the Cajun Navy, the nickname for an impromptu flotilla of volunteers who had no admiral, no uniforms, no military medals awaiting them for acts of valor. It was conscience, not a commanding officer, that summoned them into treacherous currents to carry endangered citizens to higher ground.\" The following year, one rescuer recalled ferrying as many as seven people at a time out of flooded Baton Rouge neighborhoods in his 16-foot boat.\n\nTechnology was first introduced by one of the boaters in 2016 and played a critical role during the Cajun Navy rescues. At first, people would show up and put their boats in the water without any direction. There was little organization and no way to define which areas had been rescued and which were still in need. One volunteer realized that a couple of mobile phone applications that he used for a game, Zello and Glympse, would be helpful in organizing the rescue attempts. He organized his teammates in the game to come teach boaters and other volunteers how to use the apps for the needed rescues. Eventually, the boaters would be directed by a core group of volunteers who would take requests to be rescued from the Cajun Navy Facebook group page. One volunteer started to gather requests into a Google spreadsheet which was accessible to other volunteers. They vetted the requests by calling phone numbers provided in the posts to the Facebook group page or using Facebook Messenger, then the volunteers used the Zello application to dispatch a nearby boater. Technology was essential to the success of the Cajun Navy. An unknown number of volunteers manned Facebook, using Glympse and Zello to link rescuers with those asking for assistance.\n\nIn August 2017, the Cajun Navy engaged in rescue operations in response to the major flooding of Southeast Texas by Hurricane Harvey. The \"Chicago Tribune\" referred to them \"roar[ing] into Pasadena, Texas...in high-clearance pickup trucks with bass boats and pirogues like the Cajun Cavalry, ready to help search and rescue efforts alongside first responders who were inundated with thousands of calls across the region\". Cajun Navy groups formed in the year following the Louisiana flooding performed more than 5,000 rescues in Southeast Texas, throughout cities and towns including Houston, Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Vidor. Multiple teams acted behind the scenes using social media to organize hundreds of citizens. Volunteers acted as citizen dispatchers, relaying requests for rescue from the Cajun Navy Facebook page to those boaters who could perform the rescue via Zello.\n\nIn cooperation with U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, the Cajun Navy agreed to participate in relief efforts for storm surge victims of Hurricane Irma within central and southern Florida, in September 2017.\n\nThe Cajun Navy assisted victims of flooding in Hidalgo County, Texas.\n\nIn September 2018 the Cajun Navy was activated and sent to New Bern, North Carolina to assist with rescues in the wake of major flooding from Hurricane Florence. They rescued 160 people, many from the tops of their cars and some using air mattresses because the winds were severe enough to topple boats, until local emergency management told them their help was no longer needed because all rescues could be handled by local first responders.\n\nAlso in September 2018, Cajun Navy members were mobilized in anticipation of possible flooding in New Orleans generated by Tropical Storm Gordon.\n\nAlthough initially informal groups of rescuers, there have been recent efforts to create a much more organized structure for the Cajun Navy. There are several formal regional groups now, including one of which that was acknowledged by President Donald Trump. These regional groups now include the Scott-based America's Cajun Navy (and its chapters, the Hammond-based Louisiana Cajun Navy and Texas Cajun Navy), the Watson-based Cajun Navy 2016, the Lafayette-based Cajun Navy Acadiana, the New Orleans-based Cajun Navy Relief & Rescue, and the Baton Rouge-based United Cajun Navy.\n\nIn addition there are also groups known as the \"Cajun Special Forces\" ,the \"Cajun Army\", and the “Cajun Commissary”, that assist with post-flood projects like supplying survivors with food, water and supplies, gutting houses, and other various rebuilding efforts.\n"}
{"id": "101460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=101460", "title": "Cannes Film Festival", "text": "Cannes Film Festival\n\nThe Cannes Festival (; ), until 2002 called the International Film Festival (') and known in English as the Cannes Film Festival, is an annual film festival held in Cannes, France, which previews new films of all genres, including documentaries from all around the world. Founded in 1946, the invitation-only festival is held annually (usually in May) at the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès.\n\nOn 1 July 2014, co-founder and former head of French pay-TV operator Canal+, Pierre Lescure, took over as President of the Festival, while Thierry Fremaux became the General Delegate. The board of directors also appointed Gilles Jacob as Honorary President of the Festival.\n\nThe 2018 Cannes Film Festival took place between 8 and 19 May 2018. The jury president was Australian actress Cate Blanchett, and \"Shoplifters\", directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda, won the Palme d'Or.\n\nThe Cannes Film Festival has its origins in 1932 when Jean Zay, the French Minister of National Education, on the proposal of historian Philippe Erlanger and with the support of the British and Americans, set up an international cinematographic festival. Its origins may be attributed in part to the French desire to compete with the Venice Film Festival, which at the time was shocking the democratic world by its fascist bias. The first festival was planned for 1939, Cannes was selected as the location for it, but the funding and organization were too slow and finally the beginning of World War II put an end to this plan.\n\nOn 20 September 1946, twenty-one countries presented their films at the First Cannes International Film Festival, which took place at the former Casino of Cannes. In 1947, amid serious problems of efficiency, the festival was held as the \"Festival du film de Cannes\", where films from sixteen countries were presented. The festival was not held in 1948 and 1950 on account of budgetary problems. In 1949, the \"Palais des Festivals\" was expressly constructed for the occasion on the seafront promenade of La Croisette, although its inaugural roof, while still unfinished, blew off during a storm. In 1951, the festival was moved to spring to avoid a direct competition with the Venice Festival which was held in autumn.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, the festival attracted a lot of tourism and press attention, with showbiz scandals and high-profile personalities' love affairs. At the same time, the artistic aspect of the festival started developing. Because of controversies over the selection of films, the Critics' Prize was created for the recognition of original films and daring filmmakers. In 1954, the Special Jury Prize was awarded for the first time. In 1955, the Palme d'Or was created, replacing the \"Grand Prix du Festival\" which had been given until that year. In 1957, Dolores del Río was the first female member of the jury for the official selection.\n\nIn 1959, the \"Marché du Film\" (Film Market) was founded, giving the festival a commercial character and facilitating exchanges between sellers and buyers in the film industry. Today it has become the first international platform for film commerce. Still, in the 1950s, some outstanding films, like \"Night and Fog\" in 1956 and \"Hiroshima, My Love\" in 1959 were excluded from the competition for diplomatic concerns. Jean Cocteau, three times president of the jury in those years, is quoted to have said: \"The Cannes Festival should be a no man's land in which politics has no place. It should be a simple meeting between friends.\"\n\nIn 1962, the International Critics' Week was born, created by the French Union of Film Critics as the first parallel section of the Cannes Film Festival. Its goal was to showcase first and second works by directors from all over the world, not succumbing to commercial tendencies. In 1965 Olivia de Havilland was named the first female president of the jury, while the next year Sofia Loren became president.\n\nThe 1968 festival was halted on 19 May. Some directors, such as Carlos Saura and Miloš Forman, had withdrawn their films from the competition. On 18 May filmmaker Louis Malle along with a group of directors took over the large room of the \"Palais\" and interrupted the projections in solidarity with students and labour on strike throughout France, and in protest to the eviction of the then President of the Cinémathèque Française. The filmmakers achieved the reinstatement of the President, and they founded the Film Directors' Society (SRF) that same year. In 1969 the SRF, led by Pierre-Henri Deleau created the Directors' Fortnight (\"Quinzaine des Réalisateurs\"), a new non-competitive section that programs a selection of films from around the world, distinguished by the independent judgment displayed in the choice of films.\n\nDuring the 1970s, important changes occurred in the Festival. In 1972, Robert Favre Le Bret was named the new President, and Maurice Bessy the General Delegate. He introduced important changes in the selection of the participating films, welcoming new techniques, and relieving the selection from diplomatic pressures, with films like MASH, and later Chronicle of the Years of Fire marking this turn. In some cases, these changes helped directors like Tarkovski overcome problems of censorship in their own country. Also, until that time, the different countries chose the films that would represent them in the festival. Yet, in 1972, Bessy created a committee to select French films, and another for foreign films.\n\nIn 1978, Gilles Jacob assumed the position of General Delegate, introducing the Caméra d'Or award, for the best first film of any of the main events, and the Un Certain Regard section, for the non-competitive categories. Other changes were the decrease of length of the festival down to thirteen days, thus reducing the number of selected films; also, until that point the Jury was composed by Film Academics, and Jacob started to introduce celebrities and professionals from the film industry.\n\nIn 1983, a new, much bigger Palais des Festivals et des Congrès was built to host the festival, while the Directors' Fortnight remained in the old building. The new building was nicknamed \"The Bunker\", provoking a lot of criticism, especially since it was hardly finished at the event and several technical problems occurred. In 1984 Pierre Viot replaced Robert Favre Le Bret as President of the Festival. In his term, the Festival started including films from more countries, like Philippines, China, Cuba, Australia, India, New Zealand and Argentina. In 1987, for the first time of the Festival, a red carpet was placed at the entrance of the Palais. In 1989, during the first Cinéma & liberté forum, hundred directors from many countries signed a declaration \"against all forms of censorship still existing in the world\".\n\nIn 1998, Gilles Jacob created the last section of the Official Selection: la Cinéfondation, aiming to support the creation of works of cinema in the world and to contribute to the entry of the new scenario writers in the circle of the celebrities. The Cinéfondation was completed in 2000 with \"La Résidence\", where young directors could refine their writing and screenplays, and in 2005 \"L'Atelier\", which helps twenty directors per year with the funding of their films. Gilles Jacob was appointed Honorary President in 2000, and in 2002, the Festival officially adopted the name \"Festival de Cannes\".\n\nDuring the 2000s, the Festival started focusing more on the technological advances taking place in the film world, especially the digital techniques. In 2004 the restored historical films of the Festival were presented as \"Cannes Classics\", which included documentaries. In 2007 Thierry Frémaux became General Delegate. In 2009 he extended the Festival in Buenos Aires, as \"La Semana de Cine del Festival de Cannes\", and in 2010 he created the \"Cannes Court Métrage\" for the Short Film competition.\n\nFestival Director Thierry Fremaux is known to have 'banned' selfies on the Red Carpet of the world's largest Film Festival back in 2015.\nIn 2017, along with the 70th anniversary events of the Festival, the issue of changing the rules on theatrical screening caused controversy. The enforcement of theatrical screening in 2018 resulted in Netflix being banned.\n\nThe Cannes Film Festival is organised in various sections:\n\nThe President of the Festival, who represents the Festival in front of its financial partners, the public authorities and the media, is elected by the board of directors of the Festival, officially named the \"French Association of the Film Festival\". The Board is composed of authorities of the world of cinema, as well as of public authorities which subsidize the event. The President has a renewable 3-year mandate and appoints the members of his team, including the General Delegate, with the approval of the board of directors. Sometimes a President, after his last term, becomes the Honorary President of the Festival.\n\nThe General Delegate is responsible for the coordination of the events. When Gilles Jacob passed from General Delegate to the position of the President, in 2001, two new positions were created to take over his former post, the General Director to oversee the smooth running of the event, and the Artistic Director, responsible for the selection of films. However, in 2007, the Artistic Director Thierry Fremaux, became again the General Delegate of the Festival.\n\nThe general secretary is responsible for the reception of works and other practical matters.\n\nPrior to the beginning of each event, the Festival's board of directors appoints the juries who hold sole responsibility for choosing which films will receive a Cannes award. Jurors are chosen from a wide range of international artists, based on their body of work and respect from their peers. The appointment of the President of the Jury is made following several annual management proposals made in the fall and submitted to the Festival's board of directors for validation.\n\nThe jury meets annually at the historic Villa Domergue to select the winners.\n\nThe most prestigious award given at Cannes is the Palme d'Or (\"Golden Palm\") for the best film.\n\nThe festival has become an important showcase for European films. Jill Forbes and Sarah Street argue in \"European Cinema: An Introduction\" (), that Cannes \"became...extremely important for critical and commercial interests and for European attempts to sell films on the basis of their artistic quality\" (page 20). Forbes and Street also point out that, along with other festivals such as the Venice Film Festival and Berlin International Film Festival, Cannes offers an opportunity to determine a particular country's image of its cinema and generally foster the notion that European cinema is \"art\" cinema.\n\nAdditionally, given massive media exposure, the non-public festival is attended by many movie stars and is a popular venue for film producers to launch their new films and to attempt to sell their works to the distributors who come from all over the globe.\n\nThough most of the media attention the festival receives is journalistic in nature,  the festival has been explored from the standpoint of fiction by novelists over the years.\n\nJ. G. Ballard’s Super-Cannes is about the European elite who live in a closed society by the festival. Michael Grothaus’ Epiphany Jones is a social satire about the festival and film industry and explores sex trafficking that occurs during the festival. The book was named on of the best Hollywood novels of all time by Entertainment Weekly. Iain Johnstone’s \"Cannes: The Novel\" is a dystopian tale about terrorists holding the festival hostage.\n\nIn addition to fictional works, the festival has been examined in contexts ranging from the cultural to the historical in a host of non-fiction books.\n\nIn recent years a number of gender and sexual controversies has surrounded the Cannes Film Festival. These include \"Heelgate\" in which numerous female attendees of a red carpet premiere were stopped from entering in 2015 for wearing flat soled shoes instead of high heels. The incident caused numerous female celebrities to wear flat soled shoes or no shoes at all to other red carpet premiers in a show of solidarity and protest.\n\nA number of high-profile directors and producers have also been accused of sexual harassment and abuse at past festivals. An accusation of rape involving Harvey Weinstein, allegedly occurred at the Venice festival.\n\nAs a result of the past sexual controversies and the #MeToo movement that arose out of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, in 2018, Cannes Film Festival officials announced the creation of a telephone hotline during the festival in which victims could report incidents of sexual harassment and other crimes. The hotline is in collaboration with the French government.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5323695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5323695", "title": "Capitoline Games", "text": "Capitoline Games\n\nIn Ancient Rome, the Capitoline Games (Latin: Ludi Capitolini) were annual games (\"ludi\"). They started out as religious holiday celebrations that \"called upon divine support to ensure continued prosperity for the state.\" They were instituted by Camillus, 387 BC, in honor of Jupiter Capitolinus, and in commemoration of the Capitol's not being taken by the Gauls that same year. The games lasted sixteen days, starting on October 15.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, a part of the ceremony involved the public criers putting up the Etruscans for sale by auction. They also took an old man, tying a golden bulla (amulet) around his neck, such as were worn by children, and submitting him to public derision. Festus said that they dressed him in a praetexta, and hung a bull around his neck, not in the manner of a child, but because this was an ornament of the kings of Etruria.\n\nThe original Capitoline games fell into disuse, but new ones were instituted by Domitian in 86, modeled after the Olympic Games in Greece. Every four years, in the early summer, contestants came from several nations to participate in various events. Rewards and crowns were bestowed on the poets and placed on their heads by the Emperor himself. The feast was not for poets alone, but also for champions, orators, historians, comedians, magicians, etc. These games became so celebrated, that the manner of accounting time by lustres (periods of five years) was changed, and they began to count by Capitoline games, as the Ancient Greeks did by Olympiads.\n\nThe Capitoline Games were markedly different than that of other kinds of Roman games. For one thing, the Games were specific Greek-styled games instituted by Domitian in 86 AD during a time of remodeling. From then on, these games were held every four years, a tradition held by today's contemporary Olympic Games. He built the first and only permanent building, the Stadium of Domitian in the Campus Martius, to house these Greek games. Previously, Greek games had appeared sporadically since early second century BC but had not been enduring until the first century AD.\n\nThe Campus Martius laid just west of the seven hills and outside of the pomerium. which was a hallowed, public space and had its separate grounds away from Rome itself. It had training rooms connected to baths, a concept that beforehand was not conceived due to the pre-existing Roman thought that bathing and physical exercise were separate on the whole (they considered physical training as warfare preparation and therefore had no place near baths). This bath/training room was a uniquely Greek custom.\n\nThe typical Greek games included events for javelin, long jump, and discus. Other events had wrestling and boxing. Greek styled games had several initial functions. One of them was to celebrate generals’ successes in Greece. Other functions involved power moves exercised by rulers. Roman emperors had considerable decisions over the Campus Martius.\n\nJulius Caesar had temporary stages in the Campus, including ones with an artificial lake designed for mock water fights. The Saepta was a building located in the Campus that was reserved for voting and other such political matters. It was planned by Julius Caesar.\n\nAugustus held his own games at the arena: three sets of his own––two in his name and one for his grandson. Of his games, one was named the Actian Games in 28 BC. The Actian Games had gymnastics shows on a wooden stage. The Augustalia Games were the second in 19 BC. The third Games were held in 12 BC, used to honor his promotion to Pontifex Maximus.\n\nThe appreciation that Romans give particularly to the athletes competing in the events was evident in the numerous tokens dedicated to certain athletes. In other occasions, artists such as poets, musicians, and orators were recognized for their skills. Such tokens included lamps decorated with foliage, flowers, and crowns. This was a way to commemorate the games.\n\nThe prominence of Greek athletics points towards the prevailing influence Greek culture had on the minds of the Romans. The popularity of the Greek games held in the arenas only attest to the claim. Athletics was in a way a method to preserve and highlight the virility of Greek honor in a physical way, demonstrated through feats of spectacular strengths and finesse, usually naked in order to make a statement about comparing fit Greek bodies to others. This was especially contrastive with Roman morals, which decried public nudity.\n\nThe Romans’ adoption of Greek games underlined a certain kind of thought reversal on Rome’s part. Such acceptance became more widely recognized, especially through the influx of Greek immigrants via slavery or other means of displacement. The ever-changing populous of Rome and its varied citizens soon added Greeks into the equations; even the governmental senators were sometimes selected from the Greek-provinces of Rome. In a sense, Rome was a cosmopolitan city, spoken in many languages such as Latin, Greek, and Oscan, this shows a multifaceted empire made up of different parts around the Mediterranean area. Greek arts, luxuries, and ideas were infused into Roman culture, so much so that it was not abnormal to see even Romans enact special sporting events like the ones above. The Romans merely adapted such values to their own lifestyle. In other ways, having Greek-styled games could be a tactic on the part of the Romans enjoying the culture of conquered lands.\n"}

Prices of goods and services are affected in both cases. When demand for goods or services increases, its price (or price levels) increases because of a shift in the demand curve to the right. When demand decreases, its price decreases because of a shift in the demand curve to the left. Demand shocks can originate from changes in things such as tax rates, money supply, and government spending. For example, taxpayers owe the government less money after a tax cut, thereby freeing up more money available for personal spending. When the taxpayers use the money to purchase goods and services, their prices go up.\n\nIn the midst of a poor economic situation in the United Kingdom in November 2002, the Bank of England's deputy governor, Mervyn King, warned that the domestic economy was sufficiently imbalanced that it ran the risk of causing a \"large negative demand shock\" in the near future. At the London School of Economics, he elaborated by saying, \"Beneath the surface of overall stability in the UK economy lies a remarkable imbalance between a buoyant consumer and housing sector, on the one hand, and weak external demand on the other.\"\n\nDuring the global financial crisis of 2008, a negative demand shock in the United States economy was caused by several factors that included falling house prices, the subprime mortgage crisis, and lost household wealth, which led to a drop in consumer spending. To counter this negative demand shock, the Federal Reserve System lowered interest rates. Before the crisis occurred, the world's economy experienced a positive global supply shock. Immediately afterward, however, a positive global demand shock led to global overheating and rising inflationary pressures.\n\n"}

{"id": "21936579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21936579", "title": "Eagle Summit (Alaska)", "text": "Eagle Summit (Alaska)\n\nEagle Summit is a -tall gap through the White Mountains of central Alaska. The gap was named after the nearby Eagle River by prospectors from nearby Circle, Alaska.\n\nEagle Summit is the site of a convergence zone between the Yukon Flats to the north and the low ground of the Tanana Valley to the south. Any differential in the weather within the two valleys causes high winds and precipitation when there is moisture in the atmosphere. In 1916, Hudson Stuck, who was one of the first people to climb Denali's South Peak, wrote, \"The Eagle Summit is one of the most difficult summits in Alaska. The wind blows so fiercely that sometimes for days together its passage is almost impossible. ... The snow smothers up everything on the lee side of the hill, and the end of every storm presents a new surface and an altered route. ... there is no easier pass and no way around.\"\n\nIt was for this latter reason that engineers chose Eagle Summit as the route to build the Steese Highway, which connects Fairbanks, Alaska to the Yukon River at Circle. In 1927, just 11 years after Stuck became one of the first Americans to navigate Eagle Summit on dog sled, the highway was completed and road travel over the summit became possible. Today, Eagle Summit still is the highest point on the highway and tourism guides recommend its scenic views. Eagle Summit also experiences Midnight Sun around the time of the summer solstice despite being south of the Arctic Circle, due to its elevation.\n\nThe trail of the annual Yukon Quest 1,000-mile sled dog race also passes over Eagle Summit. The area's high winds, drifting snow, and steep terrain make it the most difficult section of trail in the race, and some competitors have called it the most difficult section of trail in any sled dog race in the world. In 2006, a fierce storm atop Eagle Summit caused whiteout conditions that forced seven mushers and dog teams to be evacuated via helicopter from the mountain. Partially because of the storm, only 11 mushers finished the race — the fewest in Yukon Quest history.\n"}
{"id": "181304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181304", "title": "Edward III (play)", "text": "Edward III (play)\n\nThe Raigne of King Edward the Third, commonly shortened to Edward III, is an Elizabethan play printed anonymously in 1596. It has frequently been claimed that it was at least partly written by William Shakespeare, a view that Shakespeare scholars have increasingly endorsed. The rest of the play was probably written by someone else: Thomas Kyd, Christopher Marlowe, Michael Drayton, and George Peele among the top contenders, with recent scholars introducing Thomas Nashe to the fold.\n\nThe play contains several gibes at Scotland and the Scottish people, which has led some critics to think that it is the work that incited George Nicolson, Queen Elizabeth's agent in Edinburgh, to protest against the portrayal of Scots on the London stage in a 1598 letter to William Cecil, Lord Burghley. This could explain why the play was not included in the First Folio of Shakespeare's works, which was published after the Scottish King James had succeeded to the English throne in 1603.\n\n\"The English\"\n\n\"Supporters of the English\"\n\n\"The French\"\n\n\"Supporters of the French\"\n\n\"The Scots\"\nThere are several references made to \"the Emperor.\" This is Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor.\n\nKing Edward III is informed by the Count of Artois that he, Edward, was the true heir to the previous king of France. A French ambassador arrives to insist that Edward do homage to the new French king for his lands in Guyenne. Edward defies him, insisting he will invade to enforce his rights. A messenger arrives to say that the Scots are besieging a castle in the north of England. Edward decides to deal with this problem first. The castle is being held by the beautiful Countess of Salisbury, the wife of the Earl of Salisbury. As Edward's army arrives, the rampaging Scots flee. Edward immediately falls for the Countess, and proceeds to woo her for himself. She rebuffs him, but he persists. In an attempted bluff, the Countess vows to take the life of her husband if Edward will take the life of his wife. However, when she sees that Edward finds the plan morally acceptable, she ultimately threatens to take her own life if he does not stop his pursuit. Finally, Edward expresses great shame, admits his fault and acquiesces. He dedicates himself to use his energies to pursue his rights and duties as king.\n\nIn the second part of the play, in several scenes reminiscent of \"Henry V\", Edward joins his army in France, fighting a war to claim the French throne. He and the French king exchange arguments for their claims before the Battle of Crécy. King Edward's son, Edward, the Black Prince, is knighted and sent into battle. The king refuses to send help to his son when it appears that the young man's life is in danger. Prince Edward proves himself in battle after defeating the king of Bohemia. The English win the battle and the French flee to Poitiers. Edward sends the prince to pursue them, while he besieges Calais.\n\nIn Poitiers the prince finds himself outnumbered and apparently surrounded. The play switches between the French and English camps, where the apparent hopelessness of the English campaign is contrasted with the arrogance of the French. Prince Edward broods on the morality of war before achieving victory in the Battle of Poitiers against seemingly insurmountable odds. He captures the French king.\n\nIn Calais the citizens realise they will have to surrender to King Edward. Edward demands that six of the leading citizens be sent out to face punishment. Edward's wife, Queen Philippa, arrives and persuades him to pardon them. Sir John Copland brings Edward the king of the Scots, captured in battle, and a messenger informs Edward that the English have secured Brittany. However, the successes are undercut when news arrives that Prince Edward was facing certain defeat at Poitiers. King Edward declares he will take revenge. Prince Edward arrives with news of his victory, bringing with him the captured French king. The English enter Calais in triumph.\n\nLike most of Shakespeare's history plays, the source is Raphael Holinshed's \"Chronicles\", while Jean Froissart's \"Chronicles\" is also a major source for this play. Roger Prior has argued that the playwright had access to Lord Hunsdon's personal copy of Froissart and quoted some of Hunsdon's annotations. A significant portion of the part usually attributed to Shakespeare, the wooing of the Countess of Salisbury, is based on the tale \"The Countesse of Salesberrie\" (no. 46) in the story-collection \"Palace of Pleasure\" by William Painter. Painter's version of the story, derived from Froissart, portrays Edward as a bachelor and the Countess as a widow, and concludes with the couple marrying. Painter's preface indicates that he knew that this was \"altogether untrue\", since Edward had only one wife, \"the sayde vertuous Queene Philip\", but reproduces Froissart's version with all its \"defaults\". The author of the play is aware that both were married at the time. Melchiori (p. 104) points out the similarity of the playwright's language to that of Painter in spite of the plotting differences.\n\nThe play radically compresses the action and historical events, placing the Battle of Poitiers (1356) immediately after the Battle of Crecy (1346), and before the capture of Calais. In fact, Poitiers took place ten years after the earlier victory and capture of Calais. The compression necessitates that characters are merged. Thus the French king throughout the play is John II of France. In fact, Crecy had been fought against his predecessor, Philip VI of France. Many other characters are freely depicted at events when they could not have been present. William Montague, 1st Earl of Salisbury and John de Montfort were both dead even before Crecy. While Sir John Copland did capture the Scottish King David and bring him to Calais in 1346, shortly after Crecy, complete Anglo-Montfort victory in Brittany, alluded in the same scene, was not achieved until the Battle of Auray in 1364.\n\nIn 1596, \"Edward III\" was published anonymously, which was common practice in the 1590s (the first Quarto editions of \"Titus Andronicus\" and \"Richard III\" also appeared anonymously). Additionally, Elizabethan theatre often paid professional writers of the time to perform minor additions and emendations to problematic or overly brief scripts (the additions to the popular but brief \"Doctor Faustus\" and Shakespeare's own additions on the unperformed \"Sir Thomas More\" being some of the best known). No holographic manuscript of \"Edward III\" is extant.\n\nThe principal arguments against Shakespeare's authorship are its non-inclusion in the \"First Folio\" of Shakespeare's plays in 1623 and being unmentioned in Francis Meres' \"Palladis Tamia\" (1598), a work that lists many (but not all) of Shakespeare's early plays. Some critics view the play as not up to the quality of Shakespeare's ability, and they attribute passages resembling his style to imitation or plagiarism. Despite this, many critics have seen some passages as having an authentic Shakespearean ring. In 1760, noted Shakespearean editor Edward Capell included the play in his \"Prolusions; or, Select Pieces of Ancient Poetry, Compil'd with great Care from their several Originals, and Offer'd to the Publicke as Specimens of the Integrity that should be Found in the Editions of worthy Authors\", and concluded that it had been written by Shakespeare. However, Capell's conclusion was only supported by mostly German scholars.\n\nIn recent years, professional Shakespeare scholars have increasingly reviewed the work with a new eye, and have concluded that some passages are as sophisticated as any of Shakespeare's early histories, especially \"King John\" and the \"Henry VI\" plays. In addition, passages in the play are direct quotes from Shakespeare's sonnets, most notably the line \"lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds\" (sonnet 94) and the phrase \"scarlet ornaments\", used in sonnet 142.\n\nStylistic analysis has also produced evidence that at least some scenes were written by Shakespeare. In the \"Textual Companion\" to the Oxford Complete Works of Shakespeare, Gary Taylor states that \"of all the non-canonical plays, \"Edward III\" has the strongest claim to inclusion in the Complete Works\" (the play was subsequently edited by William Montgomery and included in the second edition of the Oxford Complete Works, 2005). The first major publishing house to produce an edition of the play was Yale University Press, in 1996; Cambridge University Press published an edition two years later as part of its New Cambridge Shakespeare series. Since then, an edition of the Riverside Shakespeare has included the play, as has the Arden Shakespeare in its Third Series (2017). The Oxford Shakespeare series has published an edition.\n\nGiorgio Melchiori, editor of the New Cambridge edition, asserts that the play's disappearance from the canon is probably due to a 1598 protest at the play's portrayal of the Scottish. According to Melchiori, scholars have often assumed that this play, the title of which was not stated in the letter of 15 April 1598 from George Nicolson (Elizabeth I's Edinburgh agent) to Lord Burghley noting the public unrest, was a comedy (one that does not survive), but the play's portrayal of Scots is so virulent that it is likely that the play was banned—officially or unofficially—and left forgotten by Heminges and Condell.\n\nThe events and monarchs in the play would, along with the two history tetralogies and \"Henry VIII\", extend Shakespeare's chronicle to include all the monarchs from Edward III to Shakespeare's near-contemporary Henry VIII. Some scholars, notably Eric Sams, have argued that the play is \"entirely\" by Shakespeare, but today, scholarly opinion is divided, with many researchers asserting that the play is an early collaborative work, of which Shakespeare wrote only a few scenes.\n\nIn 2009, Brian Vickers published the results of a computer analysis using a program designed to detect plagiarism, which suggests that 40% of the play was written by Shakespeare with the other scenes written by Thomas Kyd (1558–1594). John Jowett and Richard Proudfoot and Nicola Bennett, while not rejecting the possibility of Kyd's authorship, find that the evidence is insufficient. Citing Jowett's \"Shakespeare and the Text\", Proudfoot and Bennett identify multiple assumptions made in the attribution, crediting the first three to Jowett: that Kyd's known oeuvre (consisting of only \"The Spanish Tragedy\", \"Soliman and Perseda\", and an English translation of French playwright Robert Garnier's \"Cornelia\") is a sufficient body of evidence for comparison, that \"rarity\" of n-gram patterns is definable and doubtlessly characteristic, and that scenes within collaborative plays are always by one author acting alone. Proudfoot and Bennett add to these that selection bias prejudges outcome, making the methodology only somewhat more sophisticated than \"parallel passage\" strategies of old despite the inclusion of more text in the analysis. They cite in-progress work by Martin Mueller to digitally analyse 548 plays published between 1562 and 1662 for n-grams, but also note that some playwrights and plays of the era are known only by their names, that anonymous plays could be written by authors whose work is unknown to scholars of drama of the period, and that there was a dramatic increase in the publication of plays starting in 1593, when the practice became normalized for successful plays. Based on Mueller's work, the top ten plays with n-gram links to \"Edward III\" range from 6.3% to 4.11%: \n\nThis suggests to them that genre is more significant than author. They also note that Kyd's plays don't score that high on Mueller's scale, \"The Spanish Tragedy\" at 24th, \"Soliman and Perseda\" at 33, and \"Cornelia\" at 121. They also note that Vickers was working on a wider project to expand the canon of Kyd to include \"Edward III\", \"Arden of Faversham\", \"Fair Em\", \"King Leir\", and parts of \"Henry VI, Part 1\". \n\nCharles Forker's analysis of \"The Troublesome Reign of John, King of England\" (2011) assesses that anonymous play as being by George Peele, and \"Edward III\" as stylistically different from that of Peele. Nevertheless, Tucker Brooke identified Peele as the author of \"Edward III\" in 1908, and Lois Potter did so in 2012. \"Any case for Peele,\" write Proudfoot and Bennett, \"would take as its point of departure the fact that his known plays share several concerns with \"Edward III\": \"David and Bethsabe\" revolves around adulterous love and its consequences; the action of \"Edward I\" dramatizes the creation of the title of Prince of Wales (of which the Black Prince was only the third holder); while \"The Battle of Alcazar\" dramatizes sixteenth-century warfare — the anachronistic model for the battle narratives in \"Edward III\", with their pikes and naval gunnery.\"\n\nHarold Bloom rejects the theory that Shakespeare wrote \"Edward III\", on the grounds that he finds \"nothing in the play is representative of the dramatist who had written \"Richard III\".\"\n\n\nThe first modern performance of the play was on 6 March 1911, when the Elizabethan Stage Society performed Act 2 at the Little Theatre in London. Following this, the BBC broadcast an abridged version of the play in 1963, with complete performances taking place in Los Angeles in 1986 (as part of a season of Shakespeare Apocrypha) and Mold in 1987.\n\nIn 1977, the play was incorporated into the marathon BBC Radio dramatic series \"Vivat Rex\" as Episodes Three: \"Obsession\" and Four: \"The Black Prince\" with Keith Michell as \"Edward III\", Christopher Neame as \"Edward the Black Prince\" and Richard Burton as \"The Narrator\".\n\nIn 1998, Cambridge University Press became the first major publisher to produce an edition of the play under Shakespeare's name, and shortly afterward the Royal Shakespeare Company performed the play (to mixed reviews).\n\nIn 2001, the American professional premiere was staged by Hope Theatre, Inc. at the Bank Street Theater in Greenwich Village, New York City, which received mixed reviews. Later in 2001, it was produced again by Pacific Repertory Theatre's Carmel Shakespeare Festival, which received positive reviews for the endeavor.\n\nIn 2002, The Royal Shakespeare Company's production was performed as part of a season of little done plays by Shakespeare's contemporaries along with such titles as \"The Roman Actor\" by Philip Massinger and \"Eastward Ho\" by Ben Jonson. The production was directed by Anthony Clarke and starred David Rintoul as King Edward and Caroline Faber as the Countess. It was performed at the Swan Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, a venue known for tackling more non-mainstream titles. The production mixed costuming and set elements that included medieval armor and weaponry with 19th century style military uniforms.\n\nIn 2009, Director Donna Northcott of St. Louis Shakespeare produced a traditionally set production on a multi-tiered set at the Orthwein Theater.\n\nIn 2011, the Atlanta Shakespeare Company presented a production in repertory with \"The Two Noble Kinsmen\" at their Shakespeare Tavern Theater. In his director's note, Director Troy Willis stressed the various elements of honor and chivalry found in the play were often taught to the nobility by characters who were lower in social station than themselves. This is notable in the Countess instructing King Edward and Audley instructing the young prince.\n\nIn 2014, The Hawai'i Shakespeare Festival (HSF) presented an anime/video game style production that was notable for using dancers as stand ins for King Edward and King John as they controlled the dancers from the sides of the stage.\n\nIn 2016, The Hudson Shakespeare Company presented a production as part of their Shakespeare in the Park series and their history cycle treatment of Shakespeare’s second or major cycle producing it along with \"Richard II\" and \"Henry IV, Part 1\" and \"Henry IV, Part 2\". As \"Edward III\" takes place two generations before \"Richard II\", which was done in a late medieval style, \"Edward III\" was placed in an early medieval/Viking setting to depict an earlier time. Other notable features included by Artistic Director Jon Ciccarelli were a Viking party scene that bridged the Edward-Countess meeting scene with the Lodowick monologue and included an historical dramatization of Edward's founding of the \"Order of the Garter\" stressing the mutual attraction between Edward (Ben Forer) and the Countess (Rachel Matusewicz).\n\nIn 2016, The Flock Theater in New London, Connecticut, featured a decidedly older King Edward and much younger Countess.\n\nIn 2016, the Chicago Shakespeare Theater presented \"Edward III\" as part of a 3-play history cycle that included \"Henry V\" and \"Henry VI, Part 1\". The cycle was called \"Tug of War: Foreign Fire\" and concluded in a follow up cycle called \"Tug of War: Civil Strife\" which included \"Henry VI, Part 2\", \"Henry VI, Part 3\" and \"Richard III\".\n\nThe play featured prominently in the plot of the pilot episode of the 2017 series \"Will\" that aired on TNT. Laurie Davidson plays a young William Shakespeare who arrives fresh faced in London in 1589 with no theatre contacts and a play to sell. He sees a production at the playhouse called simply “The Theatre” with his future theatre colleagues William Kempe (William Huston) and Richard Burbage (Mattias Inwood) and decides to sell his new play, \"Edward III\", to their company. \n\nWill encounters Richard Burbage’s sister, Alice Burbage (Olivia DeJonge). Unimpressed, Alice demands that this “actor” pitch his play to her on the street while she looks out a second story window. Will reads a speech of King Edward’s from the final scene of the play to the captured French King John. However, the scene in question is one that scholars do not identify as Shakespeare’s.\n\nAlice takes pity on the peddling playwright and convinces her father James Burbage (Colm Meaney) to produce the play as the company is in desperate need of new material. James finds the play not “ready for primetime” and has Will work on the play with their resident playwright, the fictional John Baxter (Alan Aisenberg). In a day the two collaborate on the final script. This dual authorship “solves” the riddle of who co-authored the non-Shakespeare scenes. \n\nThe episode depicts and refers to several incidents in the actual play:\n\n\n"}

Its primary purpose was strategic deforestation, destroying the forest cover and food resources necessary for the implementation and sustainability of the North Vietnamese style of guerilla warfare. The U.S. Agent Orange usage reached an apex during Operation Ranch Hand, in which the material (with its extremely toxic impurity, dioxin) was sprayed over 4.5 million acres of land in Vietnam from 1961 to 1971.\n\nThe use of Agent Orange as a chemical weapon has left tangible, long-term impacts upon the Vietnamese people that live in Vietnam as well as those who fled in the mass exodus from 1978 to the early 1990s. Hindsight corrective studies indicate that previous estimates of Agent Orange exposure were biased by government intervention and under-guessing, such that current estimates for dioxin release are almost double those previously predicted. Census data indicates that the United States military directly sprayed upon millions of Vietnamese during strategic Agent Orange use. The effects of Agent Orange on the Vietnamese range from a variety of health effects, ecological effects, and sociopolitical effects.\n\nThe most illustrative effects of Agent Orange upon the Vietnamese people are the health effects. Scientific consensus has made it clear that the importance of accuracy in terms of site-specific cancer risk as well as the difficulty in identifying Agent Orange as the cause of that specific cancer risk must be acknowledged. Previous studies on the subject have not been generalizable because though they demonstrate statistically significant increase in cancer risk, the populations have been \"Western\" veterans or Korean veterans, or the sample sizes were too small to be considered appropriate. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines the margin of exposure as \"the ratio of the no-observed adverse-effect-level to the estimated exposure dose.\" Independent scientific analyses of the epidemiology of Agent Orange suggest that there is little to no margin of exposure for dioxin or dioxin-like compounds on vertebrates, meaning that even passive contact or genetic lineage has devastating repercussions.\n\nRigorous studies have consequently been conducted to instead measure the levels of dioxin still present in the blood samples of the citizens of both North and South Vietnam. These studies indicate that though most Agent Orange studies have had myopic analyses of American veterans, Vietnamese citizens have had far greater exposure to breadth and scope of the target. The pervasion of dioxin as described by Schechter et al. (made clear in very high TCDD or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin levels in human milk, adipose tissue, and blood as measured by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy) in the Vietnamese people living in Vietnam is substantially greater than that of other populations (Schechter et al., 1995). Dioxin levels were corroborated in subsequent studies, most notably those conducted in areas geographically near bombing sites and spray missions during the course of Operation Ranch Hand, approximately between 1962 and 1970. A 2002 sample study of the dioxin levels in the city of Bien Hoa, a populous city in southern Vietnam located in the proximity of an air base used for spray missions, indicated noticeably elevated blood dioxin levels despite a 20-year period of peace with Agent Orange specifically being found in the blood samples. Emigrants to the city and even children born after the end of the Agent Orange spraying operations had blood samples indicating a presence of dioxin (Schecter et al., 2001). Meta-studies have affirmed the dioxin pathway of genetic inheritance, e.g. a statistically significant correlation between paternal exposure to Agent Orange and spina bifida over three case-control studies from 1966 to 2008 (Ngo et al., 2009).\n\nMoreover, the effects of Agent Orange continue to subsist in Vietnamese refugee communities. The toxin assisted in the political and economic upheaval necessary to uproot over two million refugees from Vietnam as well as Laos and Cambodia and force them to flee to other countries. By 1992, upwards of 1 million refugees had settled in the United States, 750,000 in other North American and European countries, and an unattainable quantity of refugees in camps located across the world, unable to obtain the visas and immigration documents necessary to permanently immigrate . Scientific reports have concluded that refugees who had reported being exposed to chemical sprays while in South Vietnam continued to experience pain in the eyes and skin as well as gastrointestinal upsets. In one study, ninety-two percent of participants suffered incessant fatigue; others reported abortions and monstrous births. Meta-analyses of the most current studies on the association between Agent Orange and birth defects have concluded that there is a statistically significant correlation such that having a parent who was exposed to Agent Orange at any point in their life will increase one's likelihood of either possessing or acting as a genetic carrier of birth defects.Vietnamese studies specifically indicated an even greater correlation between parental exposure and birth defects, with scholars concluding that the rate of association varied situationally as degree of exposure and intensity were factors also considered.\n\nThe ecological effects of Agent Orange have also been devastating in regards to their destruction of plant life as well as the coercive creation of ecological refugees. The physical ecology of Vietnam has been reported to continue to affect the daily lives of Vietnamese citizens, with studies concluding that exposures to Agent Orange as empirically verified by blood dioxin levels continue to pervade in the country due to dioxin persistence in soils, oftentimes moving into river sediment, fish, and finally into people via daily consumption. Studies in the Aluoi Valley, a village near a now-defunct military base that was operating between 1963 and 1966, confirmed this process of biological magnification, as contaminated soil acted \"reservoirs\" of TCDD Agent Orange toxin that would later transfer to fish and ducks and finally to humans, all via consumption. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature concluded that \"much of the damage can probably never be repaired\".\n\nOfficial US military records have listed figures including the destruction of 20% of the jungles of South Vietnam and 20-36% (with other figures reporting 20-50%) of the mangrove forests. An overall reduction in biomass, i.e. plant and animal populations, has been noted along with loss of soil nutrients and ecosystem productivity in terms of growth yields. Forests that have been sprayed multiple times (estimates point to about a quantity of land equaling 0.5 million hectares) have extensively exacerbated ecological disadvantages; recovery times are dubious and \"the plant and animal communities have been totally disrupted\" due to \"total annihilation of the vegetative cover\". The long-term effect of this deforestation continues to result in less aged foliage and mangroves being unable to grow from even a single spraying, with many patches of economically unviable grass colloquially referred to as \"American grass\". Farm land that was destroyed in the process of militarization and the creation of battlefields produced an agricultural wasteland, forcing Vietnamese farmers to work with contaminated soil for more than 40 years.\n\nThe use of Agent Orange is considered a \"notorious example\" of the expropriation of human environment for warfare, forcing the rural Vietnamese to move to cities as ecological refugees to survive because their crops and livelihood had been destroyed. The late Harvard professor Samuel P. Huntington noted the impact of a doubling or tripling of the urban population shifted from majority rural populations directly because of the Vietnam War. Later authors note that the use of Agent Orange in committing \"ecocide\" was crucial in this construction of the ecologically displaced refugee, i.e. individuals removed from their homes as a means of crafting a weaker and institutionally dependent government and mitigating \"rural revolutionary forces\".\n\nVarious sociopolitical effects of Agent Orange have also been documented. Difficulty in maintaining judicial and civil transparency persists despite decades passing since the use of Agent Orange by the United States military. Corporations indicted by the ethicality of their chemical use have been described as \"antagonistic and focused on technological arguments\".\n\nThe first legal proceeding taken on behalf of Vietnamese victims was undertaken in January 2004 in a New York district court. Ultimately the district court held that \"herbicide spraying . . . did not constitute a war crime pre-1975\" and that international law prevented the companies that produced Agent Orange from being liable. Alternative models for reconciling the harms done by the dioxin on the Vietnamese people with reparations have also been proposed. Some have called for the defoliation and destruction to be deemed an \"environmental war crime\". Law reviews have even called for a revision to the litigation process in the US due to the harmful implications regarding justice, reparations, and accountability as a result of the political sway of aggregate private interests.\n\nCitizen-to-citizen dialogue for individuals to call for accountability by the United States government was first established in 2006 by the Ford Foundation. Citizens sought a legal avenue by which private citizens and policy makers could work together to form a coherent plan of action in addressing the legacy of Agent Orange. The US-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin, composed of members of the Aspen Institute, Vietnam National University, and Vietnam Veterans Association, is the most notable example of this civic response. Long-term programs and continued check-ups on the state of current plans to address Agent Orange are heavily monitored.\n\nQuestions of governmental accountability have been raised towards who should be responsible for allowing the use of the chemical dioxin despite knowing the risks. Those who said that the use (at the time of the Vietnam War) of Agent Orange was merely a means of defeating the Viet Cong did not believe that the defoliant violated the Geneva Protocol. However, the 1925 Geneva Protocol and Geneva Weapons Conventions signed by all members of the UN ban use of chemical and biological weapons specifically. The 1925 Geneva Convention Gas Protocol corroborated and reinforced this ban. There is reason to believe that sociopolitical context constrains the ability of government bodies to reveal the truth regarding food-behavior research as well as the scientific studies crafted by these bodies; governments may have an incentive to disrupt or obstruct investigations into the matter.\n\nAdditional remediative policies have been proposed by concerned groups of citizens due to a lack of governmental accountability. The US-Vietnam Dialogue Group on Agent Orange/Dioxin of the Aspen Institute established a 10-year Plan of Action on June 16, 2010 to call for governmental participation in addressing herbicide effect in Vietnam. This plan calls for the United States and the Vietnamese government to work with other governments and NGOs to invest 30 million dollars over ten years to clean and purify harmed ecosystems and expand services to families who have been affected medically and physically by Agent Orange.\n\nThe current scientific consensus on the effects of Agent Orange concludes that scientists at the time made erroneous judgments on how devastating the chemical could be. Scientific reviews \"ex post facto\" have indicated that many of these supposedly objective studies that conclude a beneficial use of Agent Orange were based on access to still classified documents and little else. Additionally, Koppes's study indicates that these scientists repeatedly minimize the harms of the chemical and therefore speak from a position of disbelief rather than empirical evidence.\n"}

Most of these wars were fought over the title of count of Holland, but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the bourgeois in the cities against the ruling nobility.\n\nThe Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of Holland. \nThe Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen.\n\nThe origin of the name \"Cod\" is uncertain, but is most likely a case of reappropriation. Perhaps it derives from the arms of Bavaria, that look like the scales of a fish. The \"Hook\" refers to the hooked stick that is used to catch cod. Another possible explanation is that as a cod grows it tends to eat more, growing even bigger and eating even more, thus encapsulating how the noblemen perhaps saw the expanding middle classes of the time.\n\nAfter count William IV was killed in 1345, his sister Margaret inherited the county. She was married to Emperor Louis IV and resided in Bavaria. She appointed their second son William (the later count\nWilliam V) as her representative.\n\nIn 1350, the nobles of Holland asked Margaret to return to Holland. As a reaction, the Cod league was formed on May 23, 1350 by a number of supporters of William. On September 5 of the same year, the Hook league was formed. Soon afterward, these factions clashed, and a civil war began.\n\nEdward III of England, husband of Margaret's sister Philippa, came to her aid, winning a naval engagement off Veere in 1351. A few weeks later the Hooks and their English allies were defeated by William and the Cods at the Battle of Vlaardingen, which ruined Margaret's cause. Edward shortly afterwards changed sides, and the empress saw herself compelled (1354) to come to an understanding with her son, he being recognized as count of Holland and Zeeland, she of Hainaut. Margaret died two years later, leaving William in possession of the entire Holland-Hainaut inheritance (July 1356). William was married to Maud of Lancaster, sister to Blanche of Lancaster.\n\nAlthough there were a number of smaller fights in the period after 1356, the main battle re-emerged at the death of William VI, Count of Holland and Hainaut in 1417. Both William's brother John and his daughter Jacqueline claimed the county. The Cods chose the side of John, and, after his death, of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, while the Hooks supported Jacqueline.\n\nThe result of these battles and especially of her defeat at the Battle of Brouwershaven, was that Jacqueline was allowed to retain the titles of countess of Hainaut and Holland, but that Philip would rule the county. Philip was named heir to the county, and Jacqueline, who was childless, was not allowed to remarry without Philip's consent.\n\nThe treaty became void when Jacqueline remarried in 1432 with Frank van Borssele, and she had to hand her territories over to Burgundy.\n\nThe period between 1430 and 1450 remained reasonably calm, but when Philip the Good tried to expand his influence into the Bishopric of Utrecht by appointing his natural son David of Burgundy as Bishop, Hook resistance re-emerged in Utrecht. This led to the Siege of Deventer (1456), and two civil wars, (1470-1474) and (1481-1483), concluded in favor of the Cods and Burgundy after the Battle of Westbroek and the Siege of Utrecht (1483).\n\nWhen the House of Burgundy had died out with the death of Mary of Burgundy in 1482, the Hooks revolted one more time against her husband and successor Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. The revolt was led by Frans van Brederode, but crushed in 1490.\n\n"}

Tanner (April 4, 1844 – October 2, 1927) was an American soldier and civil servant. He is best known for having lost both his legs below the knee at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Serving during the rest of the war as a government stenographer, he was present at the death of Abraham Lincoln and took notes that are the most comprehensive record of the events of the President's assassination. He later served as the United States Commissioner of Pensions, and helped reorganize and incorporate the American Red Cross.\n\nTanner was born on a farm near Richmondville, New York, on April 4, 1844. He worked on the farm most of the year and was educated in the local public schools, graduating from high school at the age of 16. He took courses at a business school for a year, and then taught public school for a few months in a neighboring school district.\n\nTanner was just 17 years old when the American Civil War broke out in April 1861. He enlisted in Company C of the 87th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and was quickly promoted to corporal. (The title \"Corporal\" stuck with him for the rest of his life as a nickname.) He saw action in the Peninsula Campaign (March–July 1862), fighting at the Siege of Yorktown (April 5 to May 4, 1862), the Battle of Williamsburg (May 5, 1862), the Battle of Seven Pines (May 31-June 1, 1862), the Seven Days Battles (June 25 to July 1, 1862), and the Battle of Malvern Hill (July 1, 1862). He then saw action at the Battle of Thoroughfare Gap (August 28, 1862), the Battle of Bristoe Station (August 26, 1862), and the Battle of Manassas Station (August 27, 1862). The last time he saw action was at the Second Battle of Bull Run, August 28–30, 1862. As Confederate artillery shelled his unit's position on August 30, shrapnel tore off his left foot and shattered his left leg below the knee. Union surgeons amputated both legs about below the knee.\n\nWith the Union army in retreat, Tanner was left behind to be cared for by a local farmer's family. He was captured by Confederate forces. Paroled after 10 days, he spent several weeks recovering in Fairfax Seminary Hospital before being sent home to New York. He learned to walk with artificial limbs.\n\nTanner won a position as deputy doorkeeper for the New York State Assembly, then worked in a variety of positions of increasing responsibility for the next few months. During this time, he learned stenography.\n\nIn October 1864, Tanner won an appointment as a clerk and stenographer in the Ordnance Department in Washington, D.C. On April 14, 1865, he was summoned to the Petersen House where Abraham Lincoln lay dying from an assassin's bullet. During the night, Tanner took the testimony of eyewitnesses to the assassination, and he was present in the room when Lincoln died at 7:22 A.M. on April 15.\n\nTanner left the Ordnance Department in December 1865 and moved back to Richmondville, New York. He took a job as a clerk of a committee in the state legislature, studied law with Judge William C. Lamont, and was admitted to the bar in 1869. He married Mero L. White, daughter of Alfred C. White of Jefferson, New York, in 1866. The couple had two sons (James A. and Earle W.) and two daughters (Ada and Antoinette).\n\nVery active in Republican politics, Tanner won a patronage position as a clerk in the New York Custom House in New York City in 1869. He was promoted to deputy customs collector and served for four years under Chester A. Arthur, the Collector of the Port.\n\nTanner ran for a seat in the New York State Assembly in 1871, but lost in what many considered were fraudulent elections. He ran for registrar of deeds and wills in Kings County, New York, in 1876, but lost again.\n\nIn November 1877, Tanner was appointed tax collector for the city of Brooklyn, New York. He held the position for eight years. He allowed citizens to pay their taxes by mail, which was a major innovation at the time. Under Tanner, annual tax collections rose from $400,000 to $2 million a year. In 1884, he ran for sheriff, but was again defeated. The election of a Democratic city administration in 1886 forced him from office, and he became a popular public speaker on the chataqua circuit.\n\nTanner was frequently called on to lobby Congress on behalf of veterans and made many speeches in favor of Benjamin Harrison's presidential candidacy. Tanner was appointed Commissioner of Pensions on March 23, 1889. He supervised the operations of the Bureau of Pensions for just five months, however. His willingness to hire disabled veterans rather than party hacks and his desire to \"treat the boys liberally\" and loosen rules so that veterans could more easily qualify for pensions led to an investigation by Secretary of the Interior John W. Noble, Tanner's superior. President Harrison then requested his resignation. He resigned on September 12, 1889. Leaving government service a second time, Tanner opened a legal practice dedicated to helping veterans win pension claims against the federal government.\n\nFrom 1889 until 1904, Tanner was a private pension attorney engaged in prosecuting various claims against the government. In January 1894, his legs were amputated a second time in an attempt to reduce the extreme pain from which he suffered.\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt appointed Tanner to be Register of Wills for the District of Columbia in April 1904. He held the position until his death.\n\nTanner became a member of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) shortly after it formed. The organization was a fraternal association for military veterans who had served in Union armies during the Civil War. His fame as a disabled veteran and witness to the Lincoln assassination made him popular among GAR members, and in 1876 they elected him Commander of the New York state organization. Many attempts had been made in the previous decade to create an old soldiers' home in the state, but none of these efforts bore any fruit. Tanner was determined to see one built by the state. He enlisted the help of the Reverend Henry Ward Beecher, a noted abolitionist and firebrand preacher, and held an organizing meeting in Brooklyn which raised $13,000 ($). Tanner then criss-crossed the state numerous times, making speeches and holding rallies. Tanner's efforts were so successful that in 1879 the New York State Legislature appropriated money for a 600-bed Soldiers' Home in Bath, New York. He later successfully campaigned for a home for Confederate veterans in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nTanner was elected National Commander of the GAR in 1905. In 1912, the United Daughters of the Confederacy invited him to the ceremony for the laying of the cornerstone for the Confederate Memorial in Arlington National Cemetery. Such was his fame that he was asked on the spot to deliver short remarks to the assembled Confederate veterans (even though he was not scheduled to speak).\n\nTanner was also a member of the Union Veteran Legion, and was elected national commander of that association as well.\n\nTanner was also active in the American Red Cross. Clara Barton founded the organization in 1881 and led it for almost a quarter century. But by the early 1900s, Barton's leadership had devolved into a cult of personality and the organization's finances were in severe straits. Barton was forced out, and new leadership established a more professional and bureaucratic organization. Among those elected to the Red Cross' board of directors was James Tanner. Tanner worked assiduously to win a Congressional charter for the reorganized American Red Cross, which was granted in 1904. Tanner later served on the organization's central committee and its executive committee.\n\nTanner died a few minutes after 8:00 P.M. on October 2, 1927, in Washington, D.C.

Written by Nunnally Johnson, the film is loosely based on the life of Jesse James, the notorious outlaw from whom the film derives its name. It is \"notorious for its historical inaccuracy.\" The supporting cast features Henry Hull, John Carradine, Brian Donlevy, Jane Darwell and Lon Chaney, Jr..\n\nThe American Humane Association began to oversee filmmaking after a horse died when it was driven off a cliff on set.\n\nA railroad representative named Barshee (Brian Donlevy) forces farmers to give up the land the railroad is going to go through, giving them $1 per acre (much less than fair price) for it. When they come to Jesse's home, Jesse (Tyrone Power) tells Barshee that his mother Mrs Samuels (Jane Darwell) is the farm's owner.\n\nBarshee repeatedly tries to force her into selling, until her other son Frank James (Henry Fonda) gets involved. Frank fights and easily beats Barshee, but Jesse shoots Barshee in the hand, in self-defence. When arrest warrants are issued for Frank and Jesse, Major A. Rufus Cobb (Henry Hull) editor in nearby Liberty, Missouri and uncle of Zerelda (Zee) Cobb (Nancy Kelly), Jesse's lover, quickly comes to tell them to leave.\n\nFrank and Jesse learn that Barshee is responsible for the death of their mother and Jesse kills him in revenge. This begins Frank and Jesse's career as outlaws. They are pursued relentlessly by the unscrupulous railway boss, McCoy (Donald Meek). Three years later, with a $5,000 reward on his head, Jesse marries Zee and turns himself in, at her insistence, having been promised a light sentence by Marshall Will Wright (Randolph Scott). But McCoy manages to manipulate the situation through his connections, by having the judge dismissed pre-trial, and installing a new judge, who is likely to favour McCoy's recommendation of imposing the death penalty for Jesse.\n\nFrank breaks Jesse out of jail, and the James gang continue their life of crime. Eventually Zee leaves him, taking their son Jesse Jr. with her. Years later, following an unsuccessful robbery, a wounded Jesse returns home and Zee joins him in the belief that they will escape to California. Meanwhile, Bob Ford (John Carradine), an old member of the James gang, together with his brother Charlie Ford (Charles Tannen), contact Jesse, claiming that Frank sent them to ask Jesse to participate in their next robbery. They assert that the job will earn them all, a large sum of money for very little risk. Jesse nevertheless refuses the Ford brothers' offer, and the brothers exit the house. However, sensing an opportunity to claim the generous reward for Jesse's death, Bob Ford sneaks back inside, and shoots Jesse in the back, thereby killing him.\n\n\n\"Jesse James\" was a smash hit and the fourth largest-grossing film of 1939, behind \"Gone with the Wind\", \"The Wizard of Oz\", and \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\", and in front of \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\". A sequel, \"The Return of Frank James\", directed by Fritz Lang and with Henry Fonda reprising his role as Frank James along with a variety of other actors playing the same characters as they had in \"Jesse James\", was released in 1940.\n\nA remake was directed by Nicholas Ray in 1957, \"The True Story of Jesse James\".\n\nThe film gained a measure of notoriety for a scene in which a horse falls to its death down a rocky slope toward the end of the film. This scene was one of many cited by the American Humane Association against Hollywood's abuse of animals, and led to the association's monitoring of filmmaking. However, according to Leonard Mosley's biography \"Zanuck: The Rise and Fall of Hollywood's last Tycoon\", none of \"the horses [had] been injured. Under Zanuck's direction, a short distance down the cliff, on a conveniently broad platform, the unit roper had arranged a soft landing for the horses.\"\n\nMuch of the filming for Jesse James took place around the town of Pineville, Missouri in McDonald County, Missouri, because at the time the town and surrounding area looked much the same as it would have in the 1880s and 1890s. The town's historic Old McDonald County Courthouse, a National Register of Historic Places site, was featured in the film serving as a stand in for the Liberty, Missouri courthouse. Pineville still celebrates Jesse James Days annually in homage to the film and the movie stars who descended on the small town to make it. In their off time from filming, the films' stars and crew, including Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda and Randolph Scott, would seek out relaxation at the Shadow Lake resort in Noel, Missouri, on the shores of Elk River (Oklahoma).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "39116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39116", "title": "La Scala", "text": "La Scala\n\nLa Scala (; abbreviation in Italian language for the official name ) is an opera house in Milan, Italy. The theatre was inaugurated on 3 August 1778 and was originally known as the \"\" (New Royal-Ducal Theatre alla Scala). The premiere performance was Antonio Salieri's \"Europa riconosciuta\".\n\nMost of Italy's greatest operatic artists, and many of the finest singers from around the world, have appeared at La Scala. The theatre is regarded as one of the leading opera and ballet theatres in the world and is home to the La Scala Theatre Chorus, La Scala Theatre Ballet and La Scala Theatre Orchestra. The theatre also has an associate school, known as the La Scala Theatre Academy (), which offers professional training in music, dance, stage craft and stage management.\n\nLa Scala's season opens on 7 December, Saint Ambrose's Day, the feast day of Milan's patron saint. All performances must end before midnight, and long operas start earlier in the evening when necessary.\n\nThe Museo Teatrale alla Scala (La Scala Theatre Museum), accessible from the theatre's foyer and a part of the house, contains a collection of paintings, drafts, statues, costumes, and other documents regarding La Scala's and opera history in general. La Scala also hosts the Accademia d'Arti e Mestieri dello Spettacolo (Academy for the Performing Arts). Its goal is to train a new generation of young musicians, technical staff, and dancers (at the Scuola di Ballo del Teatro alla Scala, one of the Academy's divisions).\n\nA fire destroyed the previous theatre, the Teatro Regio Ducale, on 25 February 1776, after a carnival gala. A group of ninety wealthy Milanese, who owned private boxes in the theatre, wrote to Archduke Ferdinand of Austria-Este asking for a new theatre and a provisional one to be used while completing the new one. The neoclassical architect Giuseppe Piermarini produced an initial design but it was rejected by Count Firmian (the governor of the then Austrian Lombardy).\n\nA second plan was accepted in 1776 by Empress Maria Theresa. The new theatre was built on the former location of the church of Santa Maria alla Scala, from which the theatre gets its name. The church was deconsecrated and demolished and, over a period of two years, the theatre was completed by Pietro Marliani, Pietro Nosetti and Antonio and Giuseppe Fe.\nThe theatre had a total of \"3,000 or so\" seats organized into 678 pit-stalls, arranged in six tiers of boxes above which is the 'loggione' or two galleries. Its stage is one of the largest in Italy (16.15m d x 20.4m w x 26m h).\n\nBuilding expenses were covered by the sale of boxes, which were lavishly decorated by their owners, impressing observers such as Stendhal. La Scala (as it came to be known) soon became the preeminent meeting place for noble and wealthy Milanese people. In the tradition of the times, the main floor had no chairs and spectators watched the shows standing up. The orchestra was in full sight, as the orchestra pit had not yet been built.\n\nAbove the boxes, La Scala has a gallery—called the \"loggione\"—where the less wealthy can watch the performances. The gallery is typically crowded with the most critical opera aficionados, known as the loggionisti, who can be ecstatic or merciless towards singers' perceived successes or failures. For their failures, artists receive a \"baptism of fire\" from these aficionados, and fiascos are long remembered. For example, in 2006, tenor Roberto Alagna was booed off the stage during a performance of \"Aida\". This forced his understudy, Antonello Palombi, to quickly replace him mid-scene without time to change into a costume.\n\nAs with most of the theatres at that time, La Scala was also a casino, with gamblers sitting in the foyer. Conditions in the auditorium, too, could be frustrating for the opera lover, as Mary Shelley discovered in September 1840:\nAt the Opera they were giving Otto Nicolai's \"Templario\". Unfortunately, as is well known, the theatre of La Scala serves, not only as the universal drawing-room for all the society of Milan, but every sort of trading transaction, from horse-dealing to stock-jobbing, is carried on in the pit; so that brief and far between are the snatches of melody one can catch.\nLa Scala was originally illuminated with 84 oil lamps mounted on the stage and another thousand in the rest of theatre. To prevent the risks of fire, several rooms were filled with hundreds of water buckets. In time, oil lamps were replaced by gas lamps, these in turn were replaced by electric lights in 1883.\n\nThe original structure was renovated in 1907, when it was given its current layout with 1,987 seats. In 1943, during World War II, La Scala was severely damaged by bombing. It was rebuilt and reopened on 11 May 1946, with a memorable concert conducted by Arturo Toscanini—twice La Scala's principal conductor and an associate of the composers Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini—with a soprano solo by Renata Tebaldi, which created a sensation.\n\nLa Scala hosted the first productions of many famous operas, and had a special relationship with Verdi. For several years, however, Verdi did not allow his work to be played here, as some of his music had been modified (he said \"corrupted\") by the orchestra. This dispute originated in a disagreement over the production of his \"Giovanna d'Arco\" in 1845; however the composer later conducted his \"Requiem\" there on 25 May 1874 and he announced in 1886 that La Scala would host the premiere of what was to become his penultimate opera, \"Otello\". The premiere of his last opera, \"Falstaff\" was also given in the theatre.\n\nIn 1982, the Filarmonica della Scala was established, drawing its members from the larger pool of musicians that comprise the Orchestra della Scala.\n\nThe theatre underwent a major renovation from early 2002 to late 2004. The theatre closed following the traditional 7 December 2001 season opening performances of \"Otello\", which ran through December. From 19 January 2002 to November 2004, the opera company transferred to the new Teatro degli Arcimboldi, built in the Pirelli-Bicocca industrial area from the city centre.\nThe renovation by architect Mario Botta proved controversial, as preservationists feared that historic details would be lost. However, the opera company was satisfied with the improvements to the structure and the sound quality, which was enhanced when the heavy red carpets in the hall were removed. The stage was entirely rebuilt, and an enlarged backstage allows more sets to be stored, permitting more productions.\n\nSeats now include monitors for the electronic libretto system provided by Radio Marconi, an Italian company, allowing audiences to follow opera libretti in English and Italian in addition to the original language.\n\nThe opera house re-opened on 7 December 2004 with a production, conducted by Riccardo Muti, of Salieri's \"Europa riconosciuta\", the opera performed at La Scala's inauguration in 1778. Tickets for the re-opening fetched up to €2,000.\n\nThe renovations cost a reported €61 million, and left a budget shortfall that the opera house overcame in 2006.\n\nCarlo Fontana, the general manager of La Scala since 1990, was dismissed in February 2005 by the board of governors over differences with the music director, Riccardo Muti. The resulting staff backlash caused serious disruptions and staff strikes. In a statement, the theatre's board said it was \"urgent to unify the theatre's management.\" On 16 March 2005, the La Scala orchestra and other staff overwhelmingly approved a no-confidence motion against Muti, and demanded the resignation of Fontana's replacement, Mauro Meli. Muti had already been forced to cancel a concert a few days earlier because of the disagreements. Italy's culture minister, Giuliano Urbani, supported the conductor but called for urgent action by management to safeguard the smooth operation and prestige of La Scala. On 2 April 2005, Muti resigned from La Scala, citing \"hostility\" from staff members.\n\nIn May 2005, Stéphane Lissner, formerly head of the Aix-en-Provence Festival, was appointed General Manager and Artistic Director of La Scala, becoming the first non-Italian in its history to hold the office. On 15 May 2006, Daniel Barenboim was named \"Maestro Scaligero\", or \"de facto\" principal guest conductor, of the company. In October 2011, Barenboim was appointed the next music director of La Scala, effective December 2011, with an initial contract of 5 years.\n\nIn December 2013, management named Riccardo Chailly the next music director of La Scala, effective 1 January 2015.\n\nStéphane Lissner left La Scala for the Paris Opera. His successor , formerly director of the Salzburg Festival, began his tenure on 1 October 2014.\n\nLa Scala will host the opening ceremony of the 134th IOC Session in 2019. \n\nNotes\nSources\n\n"}

To be considered a living fossil, the fossil species must be old relative to the time of origin of the extant clade. Living fossils commonly are species-poor lineages, but they need not be. \n\nLiving fossils exhibit stasis over geologically long time scales. Popular literature may wrongly claim that a \"living fossil\" has undergone no significant evolution since fossil times, with practically no molecular evolution or morphological changes. Scientific investigations have repeatedly discredited such claims. \n\nThe minimal superficial changes to living fossils are mistakenly declared the absence of evolution, but they are examples of stabilizing selection, which is an evolutionary process -- and perhaps the dominant process of morphological evolution.\n\nLiving fossils have two main characteristics, although some have a third. The first two are required for recognition as a living fossil stasis but some authors include the third. They: \n\nSuch criteria are neither well-defined nor clearly quantifiable, but modern methods for analyzing evolutionary dynamics can document the distinctive tempo of stasis. Lineages that exhibit stasis over very short time scales are not considered living fossils; what is poorly-defined is the time scale over which the morphology must persist for that lineage to be recognized as a living fossil.\n\nThe term \"living fossil\" is much misunderstood in popular media in particular, in which it often is used meaninglessly. In professional literature the expression seldom appears and must be used with far more caution, although it has been used inconsistently. \n\nOne example of a concept that could be confused with \"living fossil\" is that of a \"Lazarus taxon\", but the two are not equivalent; a Lazarus taxon (whether a single species or a group of related species) is one that suddenly reappears, either in the fossil record or in nature, as if the fossil had \"come to life again\". In contrast to Lazarus taxa, a living fossil in most senses is a species or lineage that has undergone exceptionally little change throughout a long fossil record, giving the impression that the extant taxon had remained identical through the entire fossil and modern period.\n\nThe average species turnover time, meaning the time between when a species first is established and when it finally disappears, varies widely among phyla, but averages about 2–3 million years. A living taxon that had long been thought to be extinct could be called a Lazarus taxon once it was discovered to be still extant. A dramatic example was the order Coelacanthiformes, of which the genus \"Latimeria\" was found to be extant in 1938. About that there is little debate--however, whether \"Latimeria\" resembles early members of its lineage sufficiently closely to be considered a living fossil as well as a Lazarus taxon has been denied by some authors in recent years.\n\nCoelacanths disappeared from the fossil record some 80 million years ago (upper Cretaceous) and, to the extent that they exhibit low rates of morphological evolution, extant species qualify as living fossils. It must be emphasised that this criterion reflects fossil evidence, and is totally independent of whether the taxons had been subject to selection at all, which all living populations continuously are, whether they remain genetically unchanged or not. This in turn gives rise to a great deal of confusion; for one thing, the fossil record seldom preserves much more than the general morphology of a specimen--to determine much about its physiology is seldom possible. To determine much about its noncoding DNA is hardly ever possible, but even if a species were hypothetically unchanged in its physiology, it is to be expected from the very nature of the reproductive processes that its non-functional genomic changes would continue at more or less standard rates. It follows that a fossil lineage with apparently constant morphology need not imply equally constant physiology, for example, and certainly neither implies any cessation of the basic evolutionary processes such as natural selection, nor reduction in the usual rate of change of the noncoding DNA. In short, not even the most dramatic examples of living fossils can be expected to be without changes, no matter how persistently constant their fossils and their extant specimens might seem.\n\nSome living fossils are taxa that were known from palaeontological fossils before living representatives were discovered. The most famous examples of this are:\n\nAll of these were described from fossils before later found alive (2 species, 10 species, one species, and one species respectively).\n\nOther examples of living fossils are single living species that have no close living relatives, but are survivors of large and widespread groups in the fossil record. Consider:\n\nThe fact that a living fossil is a surviving representative of an archaic lineage does not imply that it must retain all the \"primitive\" features (plesiomorphies) of its ancestral lineage. Although it is common to say that living fossils exhibit \"morphological stasis\", stasis, in the scientific literature, does not mean that any species is strictly identical to its ancestor, much less remote ancestors.\n\nSome living fossils are relicts of formerly diverse and morphologically varied lineages, but not all survivors of ancient lineages necessarily are regarded as living fossils. See for example the uniquely and highly autapomorphic oxpeckers, which appear to be the only survivors of an ancient lineage related to starlings and mockingbirds.\n\nThe term \"living fossil\" is usually reserved for species or larger clades that are exceptional for their lack of morphological diversity and their exceptional conservatism, and several hypotheses could explain morphological stasis on a geologically long time-scale. Early analyses of evolutionary rates emphasized the persistence of a taxon rather than rates of evolutionary change. Contemporary studies instead analyze rates and modes of phenotypic evolution, but most have focused on clades that are thought to be adaptive radiations rather than on those thought to be living fossils. Thus, very little is presently known about the evolutionary mechanisms that produce living fossils or how common they might be. Some recent studies have documented exceptionally low rates of ecological and phenotypic evolution despite rapid speciation. This has been termed a \"non-adaptive radiation\" referring to diversification not accompanied by adaptation into various significantly different niches. Such radiations are explanation for groups that are morphologically conservative. Persistent adaptation within an adaptive zone is a common explanation for morphological stasis. The subject of very low evolutionary rates, however, has received much less attention in the recent literature than that of high rates\n\nLiving fossils are not expected to exhibit exceptionally low rates of molecular evolution, and some studies have shown that they do not. For example, on tadpole shrimp (\"Triops\"), one article notes, \"Our work shows that organisms with conservative body plans are constantly radiating, and presumably, adapting to novel conditions... I would favor retiring the term ‘living fossil’ altogether, as it is generally misleading.\"\n\nThe question posed by several recent studies pointed out that the morphological conservatism of coelacanths is not supported by paleontological data. In addition, it was shown recently that studies concluding that a slow rate of molecular evolution is linked to morphological conservatism in coelacanths are biased by the \"a priori\" hypothesis that these species are ‘living fossils’. Accordingly, the genome stasis hypothesis is challenged by the recent finding that the genome of the two extant coelacanth species \"L. chalumnae\" and \"L. menadoensis\" contain multiple species-specific insertions, indicating transposable element recent activity and contribution to post-speciation genome divergence. Such studies, however, challenge only a genome stasis hypothesis, not the hypothesis of exceptionally low rates of phenotypic evolution.\n\nThe term was coined by Charles Darwin in his \"On the Origin of Species\" from 1859, when discussing \"Ornithorhynchus\" (the platypus) and \"Lepidosiren\" (the South American lungfish):\n\nA living taxon that lived through a large portion of geologic time.\n\nQueensland lungfish (\"Neoceratodus fosteri\") is an example of an organism that meets this criterion. Fossils identical to modern Queensland lungfish have been dated at over 100 million years making this species one of the oldest if not actually the oldest extant vertebrate species.\n\nA living taxon morphologically and/or physiologically resembling a fossil taxon through a large portion of geologic time (morphological stasis).\n\nA living taxon with many characteristics believed to be primitive.\n\nThis is a more neutral definition. However, it does not make it clear whether the taxon is truly old, or it simply has many plesiomorphies. Note that, as mentioned above, the converse may hold for true living fossil taxa; that is, they may possess a great many derived features (autapomorphies), and not be particularly \"primitive\" in appearance.\n\nAny one of the above three definitions, but also with a relict distribution in refuges.\n\nSome paleontologists believe that living fossils with large distributions (such as \"Triops cancriformis\") are not real living fossils. In the case of \"Triops cancriformis\" (living from the Triassic until now), the Triassic specimens lost most of their appendages (mostly only carapaces remain), and they have not been thoroughly examined since 1938.\n\nAny of the first three definitions, but the clade also has a low taxonomic diversity (low diversity lineages).\n\nOxpeckers are morphologically somewhat similar to starlings due to shared plesiomorphies, but are uniquely adapted to feed on parasites and blood of large land mammals, which has always obscured their relationships. This lineage forms part of a radiation that includes Sturnidae and Mimidae, but appears to be the most ancient of these groups. Biogeography strongly suggests that oxpeckers originated in eastern Asia and only later arrived in Africa, where they now have a relict distribution.\n\nThe two living species thus seem to represent an entirely extinct and (as Passerida go) rather ancient lineage, as certainly as this can be said in the absence of actual fossils. The latter is probably due to the fact that the oxpecker lineage never occurred in areas where conditions were good for fossilization of small bird bones, but of course, fossils of ancestral oxpeckers may one day turn up enabling this theory to be tested.\n\n- Proposed in 2017: lineage has a slow rate of evolution and occurs close to the centroid of the lineage's morphospace.\n\nSome of these are informally known as \"living fossils\".\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25086138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25086138", "title": "Mongol invasions of Tibet", "text": "Mongol invasions of Tibet\n\nThere were several Mongol invasions of Tibet. The earliest is the alleged plot to invade Tibet by Genghis Khan in 1206, which is considered anachronistic; there is no evidence of Mongol-Tibetan encounters prior to the military campaign in 1240. The first confirmed campaign is the invasion of Tibet by the Mongol general Doorda Darkhan in 1240, a campaign of 30,000 troops that resulted in 500 casualties. The campaign was smaller than the full-scale invasions used by the Mongols against large empires. The purpose of this attack is unclear, and is still in debate among Tibetologists. Then in the late 1240s Mongolian prince Godan invited Sakya lama Sakya Pandita, who urged other leading Tibetan figures to submit to Mongol authority. This is generally considered to have marked the beginning of Mongol rule over Tibet, as well as the establishment of patron and priest relationship between Mongols and Tibetans. These relations were continued by Kublai Khan, who founded the Mongol Yuan dynasty and granted authority over whole Tibet to Drogon Chogyal Phagpa, nephew of Sakya Pandita. The Sakya-Mongol administrative system and Yuan administrative rule over the region lasted until the mid-14th century, when the Yuan dynasty began to crumble.\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Oirat Mongols again conquered the region and established the Khoshut Khanate. Since then the Mongols had intervened in Tibetan politics until the Qing conquest of Mongolia and Dzungaria.\n\nAccording to one traditional Tibetan account, the Mongol emperor Genghis Khan plotted to invade Tibet in 1206, but was dissuaded when the Tibetans promised to pay tribute to the Mongols. Modern scholars consider the account to be anachronistic and factually wrong. Genghis' campaign was targeted at the Tangut kingdom of Western Xia, not Tibet, and there was certainly no tribute being paid to the Mongols prior to 1240. There is no evidence of interaction between the two nations prior to Doorda Darkhan's invasion in 1240.\n\nThe earliest real Mongol contact with the ethnic Tibetan people came in 1236, when a Tibetan chief near Wenxian submitted to the Mongols campaigning against the Jin dynasty in Sichuan.\n\nIn 1240, the Mongol Prince Godan, Ögedei's son and Güyük's younger brother, \"delegated the command of the Tibetan invasion to the Tangut general, Doorda Darqan (Dor-ta)\". The expedition was \"the first instance of military conflict between the two nations\". The attack consisted of 30,000 men (most possibly much smaller than that) and resulted in 500 casualties, along with the burning of the Kadampa monasteries of Rwa-sgreṅ and Rgyal-lha-khang. The campaign was smaller than the full-scale invasions used by the Mongols against large empires. According to Turrell V. Wylie, that much is in agreement among Tibetologists. However, the purpose of invasion is disputed among Tibetan scholars, partly because of the abundance of anachronistic and factually erroneous sources.\n\nHowever, modern studies find that the oldest sources credit the Mongol scouts with burning Rgyal-lha-khang only, while a large number of Rwa-sgreng monks were slain. The bKa’-brgyud-pa monasteries of sTag-lung and\n’Bri-gung, with their old link to the Western Xia dynasty, were spared because Doorda himself was a Tangut Buddhist. The\n’Bri-gung abbot or, according to Petech, the Rwa-sgreng abbot, suggested the Mongols had invited the Sakya hierarch, Sakya Pandita. After he met Godan, Sakya Pandita died there leaving his two nephews. Sakya Pandita convinced other monasteries in Central Tibet to align with the Mongols. The Mongols kept them as hostages referring symbolic surrender of Tibet.\n\nOne view, considered the most traditional, is that the attack was a retaliation on Tibet caused by the Tibetan refusal to pay tribute. Wylie points out that the Tibetans stopped paying tribute in 1227, while Doorda Darkhan's invasion was in 1240, suggesting that the Mongols, not known for their empathy, would not wait over a decade to respond. The text from which this claim is based on also makes other anachronistic mistakes, insisting that Genghis was planning to attack Tibet prior to Doorda Darkhan's invasion, when the real campaign was against the Tangut kingdom of Western Xia.\n\nAnother theory, supported by Wylie, is that the military action was a reconnaissance campaign meant to evaluate the political situation in Tibet. The Mongols hoped to find a single monarch with whom they could threaten into submission, but instead found a Tibet that was religiously and politically divided, without a central government.\n\nA third view is that the troops were sent as raids and \"looting parties\", and that the goal of the campaign was to pillage the \"wealth amassed in the Tibetan monasteries\". This is disputed, as the Mongols deliberately avoided attacking certain monasteries, a questionable decision if their only goal was profit.\n\nWhatever the purpose of the invasion, the Mongols withdrew in 1241, as all the Mongol princes were recalled back to Mongolia in preparation for the appointment of a successor to Ogedai Khan. In 1244, the Mongols returned to Tibet. They invited Sakya Pandita to Godan's camp, where he agreed to capitulate Tibet, after the Mongols threatened a full-scale invasion of the region.\n\nSa-skya Pandita died in 1251 and his master Köten possibly died at the same time (or, according to other sources, after 1253). Möngke Khan became Khagan in the same year. Some sources say there was a Mongolian invasion in 1251, in retribution for a failure to pay tribute, or in 1251-2 'to take formal possession of the country'. In order to strengthen his control over Tibet, Möngke made Qoridai commander of the Mongol and Han troops in Tufan in 1251. Two attacks are mentioned, one led by Dörbetei, the other by Qoridai, and the double campaign struck fear into the Tibetans. Tibetan sources however only mention an attack on a place called \"Bod kyi-mon-mkhar-mgpon-po-gdong\". Wyle is sceptical however of all of these sources, arguing that the lack of substantive evidence for an invasion raises doubts about the extent of Mongol movements in Tibet proper.' He concludes:-\n\nIn 1252-53 Qoridai invaded Tibet, reaching as far as Damxung. The Central Tibetan monasteries submitted to the Mongols. Möngke divided the lands of Tibet between his relatives as their appanages in accordance with Great Jasag of Genghis Khan. Many Mongol aristocrats including Khagan himself seem to have sought blessings of prominent Tibetan lamas. Möngke Khan patronized Karma Baqshi (1204–83) of the Karma-pa suborder and the ’Bri-gung Monastery, while Hulagu, khan of the Mongols in the Middle East, sent lavish gifts to both ’Bri-gung and the Phag-mo-gru-pa suborder's gDan-sa-thel monastery. Later William Rubruck reports that he saw Chinese, Tibetan, and Indian Buddhist monks at the capital city, Karakorum, of the Mongol Empire.\n\nAlthough, Karmapa of the Karma Kagyu school politely refused to stay with him, preferring his brother the Khagan, in 1253 Prince Kubilai summoned to his court the Sa-skya-pa hierarch's two nephews, Blo-gros rGyal-mtshan, known as ’Phags-Pa lama (1235–80), and Phyag-na rDo-rje (1239-67) from the late Köten's ordo in Liangzhou. Khubilai Khan first met 'Phags-pa lama in 1253, presumably to bring the Sa-skya lama who resided in Köden's domain, and who was a symbol of Tibetan surrender, to his own camp. At first Kublai remained shamanist, but his chief khatun, Chabui (Chabi), converted to Buddhism and influenced Kublai's religious view. During Kublai's expedition into Yunnan, his number two, Uriyangkhadai, had to station in Tibet in 1254-55 possibly to suppress war-like tribes in Tibet. Hulegu appointed his representative, Kokochu, in Tibet in mid-1250s while marching towards Iran. Since then, the Ilkhans had had possessions in Tibet.\n\nIn 1265 Qongridar ravaged the Tufan/mDo-smad area, and from 1264 to 1275 several campaigns pacified the Tibetan and Yi peoples of Xifan around modern Xichang. By 1278 Mongol myriarchies: tumens and postroads reached through mDo-khams as far west as Litang.\n\nTibet was subdued to the Mongol Empire under Mongolian administrative rule, but the region was granted with a degree of political autonomy. Kublai Khan would later include Tibet into his Yuan dynasty, and the region remained administratively separate from the conquered provinces of Song dynasty China.\n\nAccording to the Tibetan traditional view, the khan and the lama established \"priest-patron\" relations. This meant administrative management and military assistance from the khan and assistance from the lama in spiritual issues. Tibet was conquered by the Mongols before the Mongol invasion of South China. After the conquest of the Song dynasty, Kublai Khan consolidated Tibet into the new Yuan dynasty, but Tibet was ruled under the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan), separate from the Chinese provinces. The Mongols granted the Sakya lama a degree political authority, but retained control over the administration and military of the region.\nAs efforts to rule both territories while preserving Mongol identity, Kublai Khan prohibited Mongols from marrying Chinese, but left both the Chinese and Tibetan legal and administrative systems intact. Though most government institutions established by Kublai Khan in his court resembled the ones in earlier Chinese dynasties, Tibet never adopted the imperial examinations or Neo-Confucian policies.\n\nBuddhist monks from Tibet were popular and well respected in Mongol-ruled Iran (the Ilkhanate), Mongolia, China (the Yuan) and Central Asia (the Chagatai Khanate). Towards the end of the Yuan dynasty in the mid-14th century, Tibet regained its independence from the Mongols.\n\nThe Oirats converted to Tibetan Buddhism around 1615, and it was not long before they became involved in the conflict between the Gelug and Karma Kagyu schools. At the request of the Gelug school, in 1637, Güshi Khan, the leader of the Khoshuts in Koko Nor, defeated Choghtu Khong Tayiji (1581-1637), the Khalkha prince who supported the Karma Kagyu school.\n\nTsogtu Khuntaiji had established a base on the Tuul river. Known as an intellectual, he embraced the Karma sect and built monasteries and castles. He submitted himself to Ligdan Khan, last grand khan of the Mongols. He took part in Ligdan's campaign to Tibet to help the Karma sect although Ligdan Khan died in 1634 before they joined together. But Tsogtu pursued the campaign. In the same year he conquered the Tümed around Kokonor (Qinghai Lake) and moved his base there. By request from Shamar Rabjampa he sent an army under his son Arslan to central Tibet in 1635. However, Arslan attacked his ally, the Tsang army. He met the fifth Dalai Lama and paid homage to Gelukpa monasteries instead of destroying them. Arslan was eventually assassinated by Choghtu's order.\n\nThe Geluk sect asked for help Törü Bayikhu (Güshi Khan), the leader of the Khoshut tribe of the Oirat confederation. In 1636 Törö Bayikhu led the Khoshuts and the Dzungars to Tibet. In the next year a decisive war between Tsogtu Khuntaiji and Törü Bayikhu ended in the latter's victory and Tsoghtu was killed.\n\nHe has traditionally been portrayed as evil by the Geluk sect. On the other hand, the Mongolian movie \"Tsogt taij\" (1945) treated him as a national hero. It reflected the communist regime's attitude toward Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nWith his crushing victory over Tsogtu, Güshi Khan conquered Amdo (present-day Qinghai). The unification of Tibet followed in 1641-42, when Güshi Khan invaded Central Tibet and defeated the indigenous Tsangpa Dynasty. After his victory he was proclaimed (chogyal), i.e. the King of Dharma, or Teaching, by the Fifth Dalai Lama. With these events the establishment of a Khoshut Khanate was confirmed. Gushi khan granted to the Dalai Lama authority over Tibet from Dartsedo to Ladakh. The title \"Dalai Lama\" itself had previously been bestowed upon the third lama of the Gelug tulku lineage by Altan Khan (not to be confused with the Altan Khans of the Khalkha), and means, in Mongolian, \"Ocean of Wisdom.\"\nAmdo, meanwhile, became home to the Khoshuts. The descendants of Güshi Khan continued to rule as Dharma kings (chogyals) of Tibet, although they were eclipsed by the Dalai Lama and his regent for long periods. In 1717, however, the Dzungars, led by Tsewang Rabtan's brother Tsering Dondup, invaded Tibet. The invaders defeated and killed Lha-bzang Khan (the last khan of the Khoshut Khanate), a great-grandson of Güshi Khan and the fifth Dharma king of Tibet. The Dzungars deposed a pretender to the position of the Dalai Lama who had previously been promoted by Lha-bzang Khan. The 5th Dalai Lama had encouraged Mongolian lamas to prevent any non-dGe-lugs-pa teaching among the Mongols. The Dzungars soon began to loot Lhasa, thus losing initial Tibetan goodwill towards them. Many Nyingmapa and Bonpos were executed and Tibetans visiting Dzungar officials were forced to stick their tongues out so the Dzungars could tell if the person recited constant mantras (which was said to make the tongue black or brown). This allowed them to pick the Nyingmapa and Bonpos, who recited many magic-mantras. This habit of sticking one's tongue out as a mark of respect on greeting someone has remained a Tibetan custom until recent times.\n\nThe Dzungar invasion was a challenge to the imperial policy of the Kangxi Emperor, since Lha-bzang Khan had been allied to the Qing dynasty. The Emperor retaliated in 1718, but his military expedition suffered inadequate logistics and was annihilated by the Dzungars at the Battle of the Salween River not far from Lhasa. A second and larger expedition was dispatched by the Emperor and met with rapid success. The Manchus expelled Tsewang Rabtan's force from Tibet in 1720 and the troops were hailed as liberators. They brought Kälzang Gyatso with them from Kumbum to Lhasa and he was installed as the 7th Dalai Lama in 1721. In 1723 Lobzang Danjin, another descendant of Güshi Khan, defended Amdo against Qing dynasty's attempts to extend its rule into Tibet, but was crushed in the following year. Thus, Amdo fell under Chinese domination.\n\n\n"}

On Monday, 30 December 1957, 17-year-old Anne Noblett disappeared whilst travelling to her home in Marshalls Heath, Hertfordshire. A month later, on 31 January 1958, her fully clothed body was found in woodland near Whitwell. Her remains showed signs of having been refrigerated and the case was dubbed the \"Deep Freeze Murder\" by the press. Two thousand people were interviewed, and refrigeration units within a 30-mile radius were investigated but no one to date has been arrested for the murder.\n\nOn Monday, 30 December 1957, Anne Noblett, a student at Watford Technical College, had attended a dance with friends at Lourdes Hall in Harpenden in Hertfordshire. After the dance she said goodbye to friends and caught the 391 Green Line bus to return home to Marshalls Heath near Wheathampstead, where she lived with her parents (Hugh and Ira) and brothers. The last sighting of Noblett was by Shirley Edwards at around six o'clock in the evening when she alighted the bus at the Cherry Trees pub at the bottom of Marshalls Heath Lane, close to home.\n\nThere was a report, by a local resident, of car rear lights being visible further up the lane at the approximate time of her disappearance. \n\nHer parents reported their daughter as missing and police undertook a search with dogs in the area but found nothing.\n\nNoblett's body was found on 31 January 1958 by two brothers, Hugh and Brian Symonds, out walking their dog in Rose Grove Woods (known locally as Young’s Wood) near Horn Hill, Whitwell; approximately seven miles from where she was last seen. Police attended the scene, in scrub 300 yards from the main road, and Noblett's body was found fully clothed and with her spectacles on; her belongings were found close by. It was determined that she had been strangled and most likely suffered a sexual assault. Her body was also found to be frozen solid.\n\nThe crime was investigated by Detective Chief Superintendent Robert Elwell of Hertfordshire CID, who was assisted by Detective Superintendent Richard Lewis of New Scotland Yard's Murder Squad. It was determined that Anne had probably been picked up between the bus stop and her home, possibly by someone she knew. The freezing of Noblett's body could not have been a natural occurrence as the temperature in the period between her disappearance and discovery had been quite mild. Officers now considered that Noblett's body had been refrigerated and the press dubbed the killing the \"Deep Freeze Murder\".\n\nThough Noblett's body had been found fully clothed it was found that she had been stripped and redressed. Buttons on her undergarments had been attached incorrectly. \n\nIt was determined during Noblett's autopsy that she had died soon after being abducted, as the food she had eaten that day had not been digested. Dr Francis Camps, the Home Office pathologist who carried out the post mortem, determined Noblett's body had probably been put in a refrigeration unit before being transported to the wood where she was found. \n\nPolice decided that Noblett had been murdered soon after being abducted, and that her body had then been placed in a refrigeration unit. The murderer then transported the frozen body and carried it (there were no signs of dragging) from a vehicle to the wood where it was later found. They determined that the murderer would have been strong to have carried the 11-stone frozen body to where it was placed, and also that the difference in the growth of plants under and beside Noblett's body meant that she was probably placed there up to a fortnight before being discovered.\n\nAn extensive police search of all refrigeration units within a 30-mile radius of the crime scene yielded nothing. Local farmland, outbuildings and factories were also searched.\n\nThe motive for the murder appeared to be of a sexual nature.\n\nSeveral case reviews have taken place over the decades following the murder; the last in February 2017. Police admit the murderer may well have died in the intervening years. The possibility of discovering the identity of the murder is low due to a lack of DNA evidence in the case, as no physical evidence remains.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35713952", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35713952", "title": "Naval battle off Tatamagouche", "text": "Naval battle off Tatamagouche\n\nThe Action of 15 June 1745 was a naval encounter between three New England vessels and a French and native relief convoy en route to relieve the Siege of Louisbourg (1745) during King George's War. The French and native convoy of four French vessels and fifty native canoes carrying 1200 fighters was led by Paul Marin de la Malgue and the New England forces were led by Captain David Donahew. The New Englanders were successful. The Governor of Ile Royal Louis Du Pont Duchambon thought that the New Englanders would have ended their siege of Louisbourg had Marin arrived. (There were 1800 French soldiers at Louisbourg versus 4200 New Englanders.) Instead, the day following the battle, Duchambon surrendered Louisbourg to New England.\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, in May 1744, Captain David Donahue of the Resolution took prisoner the chief of the Mi'kmaq people of Ile Royale Jacques Pandanuques with his family to Boston and killed him.\n\nIn May 1745, Paul Marin de la Malgue led 200 troops and hundreds of Mi'kmaq joined a siege against Annapolis Royal. The siege was ended after three weeks when Marin was recalled to assist with defending the French during the Siege of Louisbourg (1745).\n\nDuring the Siege at Annapolis, the Wabanaki Confederacy (Mi'kmaq and Maliseet) took prisoner William Pote and some of Gorham's Rangers. During his captivity, Pote wrote one of the most important captivity narratives from Acadia and Nova Scotia. While at Cobequid, Pote reported that an Acadian said that the French soldiers should have \"left their [the English] carcasses behind and brought their skins.\" He also wrote about the Naval battle off Tatamagouch.\n\nCaptain Donahew in \"Resolution\" (12 guns, 50 crew) was travelling with Captain Daniel Fones in \"Tartar\" (14 guns, 100 crew); and Captain Robert Becket in \"Bonetta\" (six guns). The two latter ships left \"Resolution\" to pursue smoke from what they believed to be a French and native encampment. Shortly after they left, four French vessels appeared, led by Marin. Upon seeing the native canoes, Captain Donahew hoisted a French flag on his own sloop so the natives would think it was a French privateer with a prize. The wind dropped off and the Resolution was becalmed and surrounded by the French vessels and canoes. At 10:00 am on 15 June 1745, Donahew raised the British flag on his ship and a fierce two-hour battle ensued. Donahew reported firing at the four vessels two hundred rounds from his four pounders; fifty-three rounds from his three pounders, and \"my swivel and small Arms continually playing on them.” The British reported there was a \"considerable slaughter\" of the French and natives.\n\nThe four French vessels were about to board Donahew's vessel when relief arrived, Captain Fones and Captain Becket returned. As a result, the French retreated to Gouzar. The two other French vessels went up near-by Dewar's River. The natives remained behind a seawall.\n\nThe convoy eventually retreated to Tatamagouche. They built defenses on land, anticipating an attack by the New Englanders. Another New England vessel appeared. A week after the initial attack, presumably because of the number of their losses, the Huron decided to abandon the convoy and return to Quebec.\n\nThe battle was significant in the downfall of Louisbourg because Marin's relief envoy was thwarted. Without the relief of the convoy, the following day Louisbourg fell.\n\nWeeks after the fall of Louisbourg, Donahew and Fones again engaged Marin, who was now nearing the Strait of Canso. Donahew and 11 of his men put ashore and were immediately surrounded by 300 Indians. The captain and five of his men were slain and the remaining six were taken prisoner. The Indians were said to have cut open Donahew's chest, sucked his blood, then eaten parts of him and his five companions. This tale significantly heightened the sense of gloom and frustration settling over the fortress. On July 19, the 12-gun provincial cruiser of Donavan's, \"Resolution\", sailed slowly into the harbour with her colours flying at half-mast. The horrifying tale of the fate of her captain, David Donahew, and five crew members spread rapidly through the fortress.\n\nIn commemoration of this battle, the Historic Sites Monument Board, in August 1939, erected at Tatamagouche a monument in a spot overlooking the waters of the Harbour. (See Battle of Tatamagouche Monument.)\n\nCaptain Fones brought \"Tartar\" (14 guns) back safe to her home port in Rhode Island. Two cannon from \"Tartar\" are on the lawn of the Newport Historical Society (See Tartar's Guns), which were formerly mounted close to the Oliver Perry Monument at Washington Square, Newport, Rhode Island\n\n\nEndnotes\n\nLinks\n"}

At the time Newlyn was also the home to as many as five Methodist and Non-Conformist religious groups, whose congregations included the local fishermen, most of whom practised a ban on fish being landed on the Sabbath. The non-Cornish fishing crews, largely from Lowestoft and northern English ports, did not hold the same opinions about Sabbath observation, and would frequently land fish on a Sunday attracting higher prices for their fish than those sold on a weekday.\n\nThe riots began in the early morning of Monday 18 May when a group of up to 40 Newlyn fishermen, supported by a mob of around 1,000 others, boarded the boats of \"East\" (of Cornwall) fishermen moored in Newlyn Harbour and destroyed their catches. By mid-morning some 16 boats had been seized and approximately 100,000 mackerel thrown overboard. By midday messages were sent to the fishing communities of St Ives, Mousehole and Porthleven for help in intercepting the further 100 non-Cornish fishing vessels still at sea in the area.\n\nWithin minutes of the riot's beginning, a message was sent to the county police station at Chyandour in Penzance asking for assistance, and by mid-morning a large number of police had assembled from all parts of west Cornwall. Since an estimated 100 Lowestoft vessels were still at sea a small steamer was dispatched, containing the Newlyn harbour master, to advise them of the situation; the steamer was duly chased by a local trawler. By late afternoon the Porthleven fleet arrived in support of the Newlyn men.\n\nThe next day the police and local fisherman exchanged in a number of violent encounters around Newlyn Harbour. The only recorded injury was to local Police Inspector Matthews, who was knocked on the head by a fish box. As the rioting continued seven \"Yorkie\" vessels were sighted making for Penzance harbour to land their catches there. Around 300 of the rioters then made for that harbour and were met by a detachment of the Penzance Borough Police, supported by a group of local Penzance youths. The strong resistance met on arrival in Penzance forced the rioters to return to Newlyn.\n\nBy mid-afternoon the situation had become so serious that the local authorities asked for military assistance. At 6:00 pm 400 soldiers from the Royal Berkshire Regiment under Major Massard arrived by train at Penzance railway station and made for temporary barracks in Penzance to await orders.\n\nAround 8:00 pm a considerable riot broke out between the Newlyn, Porthleven and St Ives men, and the men of Penzance supported by the men of Lowestoft, who had by this time managed to land their catches. Around 100 police of both the Penzance and Cornwall forces attempted to intervene but were beaten back, this leading the police to summon the assistance of the military recently stationed in Penzance. The soldiers immediately made for Newlyn, again joined by several hundred Penzance men, and, upon crossing Newlyn bridge, were met with stone throwing. The soldiers then made for the Harbour and occupied the piers. While this was occurring the torpedo boat destroyer HMS \"Ferret\" entered the harbour. The arrival of the military calmed the rioters, and by midnight that day they had largely dispersed.\n\n"}

{"id": "10115233", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10115233", "title": "Savaging", "text": "Savaging\n\nSavaging is a term used in the study of ethology that refers to aggressive behaviour displayed by the mother towards the offspring. Aggressive behaviour includes being rough with, injuring, biting, attacking, crushing and killing (maternal infanticide) of the offspring. While savaging behaviour has been seen in multiple species, it is predominantly demonstrated in domestic pigs (\"Sus scrofa domesticus\"). As the definition of savaging is so broad, research on the prevalence of savaging behaviour varies with reports of little savaging of offspring to savaging of offspring up to the 20th percentile. Prevalence of aggressive, non-fatal savaging is greater in gilts as piglet-focused aggression is more frequent in young animals than sows. Occurrence of savaging demonstrated by sows is greater if the sow has previously savaged her offspring either as a gilt or sow. Savaging behaviour usually occurs during the first two days after parturition. Prevalence of savaging is similar among first and second farrowing cycles. Savaging behaviour has a significant impact on both agricultural economy and animal welfare which is why it is currently a subject of interest in the pig industry.\n\nThere exist multiple environmental factors that increase the rate of savaging demonstrated by pigs. It has been shown that human attitudes and behaviour can affect the behaviour of domestic pigs. For example, annoyance and transmission of emotions can occur in gilts and sows when a new worker enters the farrowing rooms and makes excessive noise, does not feed the animals in a timely manner and/or is frustrated/annoyed. Research suggests that maternal behaviour may improve when workers and pigs are familiar with their environment and on a set schedule. Another environmental factor that has been examined is the amount of time spent by humans in the farrowing room. Decreased disturbance of the sows by human intrusions during farrowing has indicated a decrease in savaging behavior. A study by Gonyou and Harris found that increasing light exposure in the farrowing rooms to 16–24 hours per day decreased piglet deaths due to savaging. A further environmental cause of savaging may be the shock mothers feel upon the arrival of the piglets. Piglet arrival can cause fear and alarm in gilts and sows as a new and unfamiliar stimulus has been presented. Some studies have found evidence of increased savaging rates in larger litter sizes as well.\n\nIt has been proposed that the degree of aggressive behaviour displayed prior to farrowing cycles by sows and gilts predicts whether the offspring will be savaged and to what extent. Evidence has also been found that savaging sows may be genetically less likely to crush piglets, which lends to the existing research supporting that savaging sows can be competent mothers. High levels of oestradiol at postpartum and high levels of pre-farrowing oestradiol to progesterone ratios in gilts show more savaging behaviour to piglets. Additionally, low plasma oxytocin during the immediate postpartum period shows an increase in savaging behaviour. Heritability estimates of 0.11 and 0.25 from half-sib analyses have demonstrated that selection against sow savaging of pigs is possible; however, it may be slow to show effectiveness.\n\nThe pig industry is investing in research regarding savaging behaviours in hopes to diminish the losses they face when gilts and sows commit infanticide. Sedation techniques following birth have prevented savaging; however, in many cases, the onset of aggression is merely delayed. The industry has also attempted to avoid savaging behavior by limiting reproduction in gilts and sows that have previously savaged their offspring. Efforts to eliminate the behavior include additional care and attention to the mother pig during her farrowing cycles.\n\nSavaging of offspring by the biological mother has been reported in multiple species including farmed silver foxes, farmed wild boar and domestic breeds of farmed pigs. Though aggressive savaging behaviour is demonstrated by other species, it is most commonly used to describe pig aggression. Research has shown that primiparous silver foxes demonstrate savaging shortly after birth with a 37% chance of killing the offspring through bite wounds. Silver foxes have been shown to engage in savaging behaviour followed by infanticide and cannibalism of the offspring. Savaging in wild boars has been found to have genetic significance as different genetic lines have produced varying degrees of savaging. Wild boars have shown aggression after parturition towards their offspring; however, they have lower infanticide rates than other species.\n\n\n"}

On June 2, 1995, he was shot down over Bosnia and Herzegovina by an 2K12 Kub mobile SAM launcher and forced to eject from his F-16C into hostile territory. After nearly a week of evading the Serbs he was eventually rescued by Marines. He was previously involved in the Banja Luka incident where he fired upon six enemy aircraft. The 2001 film \"Behind Enemy Lines\" is loosely based upon his experiences.\n\nIn September 2011, O'Grady announced a run for the 2012 Republican nomination for Texas State Senate District 8, held at the time by the retiring Republican Florence Shapiro, but he later suspended his campaign because of uncertainties over the Texas redistricting fight.\n\nThe Bosnian War was an international armed conflict that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between April 1992 and December 1995. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), after popular pressure, had decided to intervene in the Bosnian War after allegations of war crimes against civilians were made by various media organizations. NATO military involvement primarily involved enforcement of a \"No Fly Zone\" code named Operation Deny Flight to discourage military aircraft of the Bosnian-Serb Armed Forces from attacking Bosnian civilians and Bosniak and Croat forces. As part of that operation, two F-16s from the 555th Fighter Squadron based at Aviano Air Base, Italy, were patrolling the skies above Bosnia on June 2, 1995.\n\nOn the ground, a Bosnian Serb Army 2K12 Kub surface-to-air missile battery near Mrkonjić Grad was readying to fire its missiles on NATO aircraft. The Serbs had moved the mobile tracked missile battery and laid a trap. They switched on their missile radars sparingly, giving F-16 fighters little warning. Waiting until a plane was directly overhead, where the aircraft's warning and countermeasures would be at their weakest, they fired two missiles. In the cockpit, O'Grady's instruments alerted him that a missile was coming but, because he was flying through an overcast, he could not see it. The first missile exploded between the two aircraft. The second struck the F-16 piloted by O'Grady. His flight lead, Captain Bob Wright, saw O'Grady's plane burst into flames and break in two. Wright did not see a parachute, but O'Grady survived by ejecting from the aircraft.\n\nO'Grady landed among a Bosnian-Serb population he was briefed would be unfriendly. He quickly secured a 29-pound survival bag, ran, and hid. Rubbing dirt on his face, he hid face-down as Bosnian-Serb forces came upon his parachute, half a dozen times shooting their rifles only feet from where he was hidden in an effort to flush him out or kill him.\n\nDuring the next six days, he put to use the lessons learned during a 17-day Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) training session he had undertaken near his hometown of Spokane, Washington. He ate leaves, grass, and bugs, and stored the little rainwater he could collect with a sponge in plastic bags.\n\nO'Grady radioed for help immediately but had to remain quiet with paramilitaries coming within feet of him; he used the radio following standard operating procedures as the U.S. Air Force had taught him so not to give away his position to unfriendly forces. On his 6th night on the ground he made radio contact, signalling his location using his radio's limited battery power. NATO planes conducting sorties in the Balkans had been picking up beeper snippets that they thought could be coming from O'Grady. This extremely sensitive information was inadvertently revealed by General Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, when the general told reporters attending a promotion ceremony that monitors had detected \"intermittent\" transmissions. A NATO official was quoted as saying \"I was dumbfounded he said that... I mean, why not just announce to the bad guys, 'We think he's alive and kicking, and we hope we find him before you do'?\"\n\nJust after midnight on June 8, he spoke into the radio. An F-16 pilot from the 510th responded and, after confirming his identity, the rescue was set in motion. At 4:40, Admiral Leighton Smith, commander of NATO Southern Forces, called US Marine Corps Colonel Martin Berndt aboard USS \"Kearsarge\" with orders to \"execute\".\n\nTwo CH-53 Sea Stallions with 51 marines from the 3rd Battalion 8th Marines within the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit lifted off USS \"Kearsarge\" to rescue the pilot. The two helicopters were accompanied by two Marine Corps AH-1W SuperCobra helicopter gunships and a pair of Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jets. These six aircraft had support from identical sets of replacement helicopters and jump jets as well as two Navy EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare planes, two Air Force EF-111A Raven electronic warfare planes, two Marine F/A-18D Hornets, a pair of anti-tank Air Force A-10 Thunderbolts, and a NATO AWACS radar plane.\n\nAt 6:35 a.m., the helicopters approached the area where O'Grady's signal beacon had been traced. The pilots saw bright yellow smoke coming from trees near a rocky pasture where O'Grady had set off a flare. The first Sea Stallion, commanded by Major William Tarbutton, touched down and 20 marines jumped off the aircraft and set up a defensive perimeter. As the second Sea Stallion landed, a figure with a pistol who turned out to be the missing pilot appeared running towards the Marines and immediately went to the Sea Stallion. As the side door opened, he was pulled in before the second 20 Marines poised to leave by the rear ramp could even move. They were called back to their seats, and those who had formed the defensive perimeter reboarded the other helicopter. After a quick head count, the Stallions took off. They had been on the ground no more than seven minutes.\n\nThe Marines, with O'Grady, flew low over Serb-held Bosnia. However, American aircraft detected a Serb missile radar along the Croatian coast, scanning for targets. An American plane recommended destroying the Serb radar, code-named Giraffe. The request was denied, partly out of concern that a strike could spark wider conflict.\n\nMinutes later, the Marines reported they were under fire. Three shoulder-held surface-to-air missiles had been launched at them but missed, as the helicopter pilots—flying 150 feet off the ground at 175 mph—jinked to evade them. Serb small arms pocked both helicopters; the Marines aboard heard the bullets hit inside the fuselage. One door gunner returned fire. One round hit some communication gear in the chopper and the bullet ended up against Master Sergeant Angel Castro Jr.'s armor without injuring anyone. At 7:15 AM local time, 30 minutes after picking up O'Grady, the rescuers reported \"feet wet\", meaning they were over water. O'Grady was back aboard the \"Kearsarge\" at 7:30. All of the aircraft landed without further incident.\n\nOn August 11, 1995, a USAF RQ-1 Predator UAV was shot down by Serb forces in the same area. The Serbs recovered the wreckage and handed it over to Russia for technical evaluation. On August 30, NATO launched Operation Deliberate Force, a massive airstrike campaign which eventually lifted the siege of Sarajevo and led to the end of the war in Bosnia.\n\nO'Grady received a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for this mission.\n\nO'Grady was born in Brooklyn, New York City, a son of William P. O'Grady and Mary Lou Scardapane, and graduated from Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane, Washington. He is a former cadet in the Civil Air Patrol and a 1989 Air Force ROTC graduate from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's campus in Prescott, Arizona. After his rescue, O'Grady transferred from active duty in the regular U.S. Air Force to the Air Force Reserve, where he continued to fly the F-16. In May 2007, he completed a master's degree in biblical studies at Dallas Theological Seminary in Dallas, Texas. He resides in Frisco in Collin County, Texas.\n\nO'Grady is an active Republican, having spoken at the 1996 Republican convention in support of Bob Dole. In 2004, O'Grady, supporting George W. Bush for re-election, accused Bush's opponent John Kerry of \"treason\" for actions taken during the Vietnam War. O'Grady endorsed Brian Birdwell in his successful 2010 bid for the Texas State Senate, then launched his own candidacy for the Texas statehouse in September 2011, seeking the 2012 Republican nomination in Senate District 8 following the retirement of Sen. Florence Shapiro. O'Grady dropped out of the race in early 2012, claiming Shapiro had reneged on a promise to support him in the Republican primary, while his opponent had numerous endorsements.\n\nThe shootdown incident was depicted and described on the documentary television program \"Situation Critical\" in episode No. 5, \"\"Downed Pilot\".\" This has been shown on the National Geographic Channel. It was also covered in \"Escape! – Escape From Bosnia: The Scott O'Grady Story\" on the History Channel. BBC also made a documentary, titled \"Missing in Action\", that was later purchased by 20th Century Fox and Discovery Communications.\n\nThe 2001 film \"Behind Enemy Lines\", starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson, is loosely based on this event. Although O'Grady had given the film a positive rating on the film review television show \"Hot Or Not,\" O'Grady took offense at the portrayal of 'his' character in \"Behind Enemy Lines\" \"as a pilot who disobeys orders and swears\". O'Grady sued 20th Century Fox in 2002 for falsely misleading the public that the film was true to life and for using him unauthorized to promote the film without his permission. He also took action over the documentary, \"Behind Enemy Lines: The Scott O'Grady Story\", which was a reedited version of a BBC documentary which Discovery Communications, parent company of the Discovery Channel, had purchased and edited. The documentary was broadcast several times on the Discovery Channel, and O'Grady accused Fox of using it to promote the film. Both suits were settled in 2004. Fox made a confidential settlement with O'Grady, while a Texas court ruled against O'Grady and in favor of Discovery Communications. The judge's ruling stated, in effect, that the events in a person's life are not the same thing as that person's likeness or image.\n\nO'Grady co-wrote two books, collaborating on one, with Michael French, that detailed his experiences of being shot down over Bosnia and his eventual rescue, \"Basher Five-Two: The True Story of F-16 Fighter Pilot Captain Scott O'Grady.\" He first wrote a book that was a New York Times Bestseller about his experience in \"Return with Honor\" with Jeff Coplon. Another book has also been written; this one, \"\"Good To Go:\" The Rescue of Capt. Scott O'Grady, USAF, from Bosnia,\" was written by Mary Pat Kelly.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "869742", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=869742", "title": "Sidd Finch", "text": "Sidd Finch\n\nSidd Finch is a fictional baseball player, the subject of the notorious April Fools' Day hoax article \"The Curious Case of Sidd Finch\" written by George Plimpton and first published in the April 1, 1985 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\". According to Plimpton, Finch was raised in an English orphanage, learned yoga in Tibet, and could throw a fastball as fast as .\n\nIn early 1985, Mark Mulvoy, the managing editor of \"Sports Illustrated\", noticed that a cover date that year would fall on April 1. He asked George Plimpton to commemorate this with an article on April Fools' Day jokes in sports. When Plimpton found himself unable to find enough examples to craft an article, Mulvoy gave Plimpton permission to create his own hoax.\n\nPlimpton reported that Hayden Siddhartha \"Sidd\" Finch was a rookie baseball pitcher in training with the New York Mets. He also wore only one shoe—a heavy hiker's boot—when pitching. Finch, who had never played baseball before, was attempting to decide between a sports career and one playing the French horn. What was astonishing about Finch was that he could pitch a fastball at an amazing , far above the record of a \"mere\" , with pinpoint accuracy, and without needing to warm up. The Mets scouting report gave Finch a \"9\" on fastball velocity and control: \"8\" is the highest score on the scale.\n\nAccording to Plimpton, Finch grew up in an English orphanage and was adopted by an archaeologist who later died in a plane crash in Nepal. After briefly attending Harvard University, he went to Tibet to learn \"yogic mastery of mind-body\" under \"the great poet-saint Lama Milaraspa\", which was the source of his pitching prowess. Finch decided not to pursue a baseball career, instead choosing to \"play the French horn or golf or something.\"\n\nThe story was accompanied by photographs of Finch, including one featuring a young Lenny Dykstra and another of Finch talking with the Mets' actual pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre. The Mets played along with the hoax, even providing a uniform and number (21) for Finch. \n\n\"Sports Illustrated\" photographer Lane Stewart recruited his friend, Joe Berton, who was a junior high school art teacher from Oak Park, Illinois, to portray Finch. Berton posed as Finch for the photographs (usually with his face averted from the lens). Berton stands at and wears a size 14 shoe.\n\nNovelist Jonathan Dee, who was working as Plimpton's assistant at the time, described Plimpton at the time of the writing of the article as, \"a wreck. Nothing, he knew,\" wrote Dee years later, \"falls quite so flat as a bad joke. Such was his anxiety that, for the one and only time in my five years in his employ, he asked me to come in to work on a Saturday. I still remember my naïve astonishment at the sight of a world-famous, successful writer actually agonizing over whether something he’d written was good enough, funny enough, believable enough, or whether the whole thing would wind up making him seem like a national jackass.\" Dee also talked about his role in the Finch hoax in an outtake from the documentary film \"Plimpton! Starring George Plimpton as Himself\".\n\nThe story was released in late March 1985. Mets fans were overjoyed at their luck in finding such a player, and flooded \"Sports Illustrated\" with requests for more information. The sports editor of one of New York's newspapers complained to Jay Horwitz, the public relations director of the Mets, for allowing \"Sports Illustrated\" to have the scoop. Two (unnamed) general managers called Commissioner of Baseball Peter Ueberroth to ask how their batters could face Finch safely. Meanwhile, the \"St. Petersburg Times\" sent a reporter to find Finch, and a radio talk show host claimed he saw Finch pitch.\n\nThe Mets gave Finch a locker between George Foster and Darryl Strawberry. The three major networks, CBS, NBC, and ABC, and the local St. Petersburg, Florida newspapers sent reporters to Al Lang Stadium for a press conference about Finch. At the April 2 press conference, Berton announced his retirement.\n\nThe subhead of the article read: \"He's a pitcher, part yogi and part recluse. Impressively liberated from our opulent life-style, Sidd's deciding about yoga—and his future in baseball.\" The first letters of these words spell out \"Happy April Fools' Day – a(h) fib\". Despite this clue and the obvious absurdity of the article, many people believed Finch actually existed. The magazine printed a much smaller article in the following April 8 issue announcing Finch's retirement. It then announced it was a hoax on April 15.\n\nPlimpton eventually broadened his article into a novel, first published in 1987. The book discussed Finch's \"brief re-commitment to baseball,\" in which stories of Sadaharu Oh and Steve Dalkowski, as well as Finch's girlfriend, inspire Finch to stick with baseball, and he reaches Major League Baseball with the Mets.\n\nIn April 2015, ESPN released a documentary on its \"30 for 30 Shorts\" program about the Sidd Finch phenomenon, as another April Fools' joke for a new generation.\n\nOn August 26, 2015, the Brooklyn Cyclones had a Sidd Finch bobblehead give-away for the thirtieth anniversary of the event. George Plimpton had passed away, so his son Taylor threw the ceremonial first pitch. Joe Berton attended and signed autographs on the bobbleheads. The bobblehead showed Finch in a Cyclones uniform, with French Horn and one bare foot. The Cyclones were not in existence in 1985; a team executive explained in an interview during the game radio broadcast that using the Major League team name and logo would have been much more expensive.\n\n"}
{"id": "2253393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2253393", "title": "Siege of Jerusalem (1187)", "text": "Siege of Jerusalem (1187)\n\nThe Siege of Jerusalem was a siege on the city of Jerusalem that lasted from September 20 to October 2, 1187, when Balian of Ibelin surrendered the city to Saladin. Citizens who were able to pay the ransom were set free, however several thousand were enslaved. Though Jerusalem fell, it was not the end of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, as the capital shifted first to Tyre and later to Acre after the Third Crusade. Latin Christians responded in 1189 by launching the Third Crusade led by Richard the Lionheart, Philip Augustus, and Frederick Barbarossa separately.\n\nThe Kingdom of Jerusalem, weakened by internal disputes, was defeated at the Battle of Hattin on 4 July 1187. Most of the nobility were taken prisoner, including King Guy. Thousands of Muslim slaves were freed. By mid-September, Saladin had taken Acre, Nablus, Jaffa, Toron, Sidon, Beirut, and Ascalon. The survivors of the battle and other refugees fled to Tyre, the only city able to hold out against Saladin, due to the fortuitous arrival of Conrad of Montferrat.\n\nIn Tyre, Balian of Ibelin had asked Saladin for safe passage to Jerusalem in order to retrieve his wife Maria Comnena, Queen consort of Jerusalem and their family. Saladin granted his request, provided that Balian not take up arms against him and not remain in Jerusalem for more than one day; however, upon arrival in the holy city, Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem, Queen Sibylla, and the rest of the inhabitants begged him to take charge of the defense of the city. Heraclius, who argued that he must stay for the sake of Christianity, offered to absolve him of the oath, and Balian agreed.\n\nHe sent word of his decision to Saladin at Ascalon via a deputation of burgesses, who rejected the sultan's proposals for a negotiated surrender of Jerusalem; however, Saladin arranged for an escort to accompany Maria, their children, and all their household to Tripoli. As the highest ranking lord remaining in Jerusalem, according to the chronicler Ibn al-Athir, Balian was seen by the Muslims as holding a rank \"more or less equal to that of a king.\"\n\nBalian found the situation in Jerusalem dire. The city was filled with refugees fleeing Saladin's conquests, with more arriving daily. There were fewer than fourteen knights in the whole city, so he created sixty new knights from the ranks of the squires (knights in training) and burgesses. He prepared for the inevitable siege by storing food and money. The armies of Syria and Egypt assembled under Saladin, and after conquering Acre, Jaffa, and Caesarea, though he unsuccessfully besieged Tyre, the sultan arrived outside Jerusalem on September 20. \n\nAfter a brief reconnoiter around the city, Saladin's army came to a rest before the Tower of David and the Damascus Gate. His archers continually pelted the ramparts with arrows. Siege towers/belfries were rolled up to the walls, but were pushed back each time. For six days, skirmishes were fought with little result. Saladin's forces suffered heavy casualties after each assault. On September 26, Saladin moved his camp to a different part of the city, on the Mount of Olives where there was no major gate from which the crusaders could counter-attack. The walls were constantly pounded by the siege engines, catapults, mangonels, petraries, Greek fire, crossbows, and arrows. A portion of the wall was mined, and it collapsed on September 29. The crusaders were unable to push Saladin's troops back from the breach, but at the same time the Muslims could not gain entrance to the city. Soon there were only a few dozen knights and a handful of remaining men-at-arms defending the wall, as no more men could be found even for the promise of an enormous fee. \n\nThe civilians were in great despair. According to a passage possibly written by Ernoul, a squire of Balian, in the \"Old French Continuation of William of Tyre\", the clergy organized a barefoot procession around the walls, much as the clergy on the First Crusade had done outside the walls in 1099. At Mount Calvary, women cropped their children's hair, after immersing them chin-deep in basins of cold water. These penances were aimed at turning away God's wrath from the city, but \"…Our Lord did not deign to hear the prayers or noise that was made in the city. For the stench of adultery, of disgusting extravagance and of sin against nature would not let their prayers rise to God.\" \n\nAt the end of September, Balian rode out with an envoy to meet with the sultan, offering surrender. Saladin told Balian that he had sworn to take the city by force, and would only accept an unconditional surrender. Saladin told Balian that Saladin's banner had been raised on the city wall, but his army was driven back. Balian threatened that the defenders would destroy the Muslim holy places, slaughter their own families and the 5000 Muslim slaves, and burn all the wealth and treasures of the Crusaders. Saladin, who wanted to take the city with as little bloodshed of his fellow Muslims as possible, insisted that the Crusaders were to unconditionally surrender but could leave by paying a ransom of ten dinars for men, five for women and two for children; those who couldn't pay would be enslaved. Balian told him that there were 20,000 in the city who could never pay that amount. Saladin proposed a total of 100,000 dinars to free all the 20,000 Crusaders who were unable to pay. Balian complained that the Christian authorities could never raise such a sum. He proposed that 7,000 of them would be freed for a sum of 30,000 dinars, and Saladin agreed.\n\nOn Balian's orders the Crusaders surrendered the city to Saladin's army on October 2. The take-over of the city was relatively peaceful especially in contrast to the Crusader siege of the city in 1099. Balian paid 30,000 dinars for freeing 7,000 of those unable to pay from the treasury of the city. The large golden Christian cross that had been placed over the Dome of the Rock by the Crusaders was pulled down and all Muslim prisoners of war taken by the Crusaders were released by Saladin who according to the Kurdish scholar and historian Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad, numbered close to 3,000. Saladin allowed many of the noble women of the city to leave without paying any ransom. For example, a Byzantine queen living a monastic life in the city was allowed to leave the city with her retinue and associates as also Sibylla, the queen of Jerusalem and wife of the captured King Guy. Saladin also granted her safe passage to visit her captive husband in Nablus. The Native Christians were allowed to remain in the city while those of Crusader origin were allowed to leave Jerusalem for other lands along with their goods through a safe passage via Akko by paying a ransom of 10 dinars. Saladin's brother, Al-Adil was moved by the sight and asked Saladin for 1,000 of them as reward of his services. Saladin granted his wish and Al-Adil immediately released them all. Heraclius upon seeing this asked Saladin for some slaves to liberate. He was granted 700 while Balian was granted 500 and all of them were freed by them. All the aged people who could not pay the ransom were freed by orders of Saladin and allowed to leave the city. He then proceeded to free 1,000 more captives upon request of Muzaffar al-Din Ibn Ali Kuchuk who claimed they were from his hometown of Urfa. In order to control the departing population he ordered the gates of the city to be closed. At each gate of the city a commander was placed who checked the movement of the Crusaders and made sure only those who paid the ransom left the city. The grand masters of the Templars and Hospitallers were approached to donate money for the release of the poor Crusaders. However they refused and a riot almost erupted after which they were forced to donate the money. Saladin then assigned some of his officers the job of ensuring the safe arrival of the Crusaders in Christian lands. 15,000 of those who could not pay the ransom were ransomed into slavery. According to Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani, 7,000 of them were men and 8,000 were women and children. \n\nOn Saladin's orders, the ransomed inhabitants marched away in three columns accompanied by 50 cavalrymen of Saladin's army. The Templars and Hospitallers led the first two, with Balian and the Patriarch leading the third. Balian joined his wife and family in County of Tripoli. The refugees first reached Tyre where only men who could fight were allowed to enter the city by Conrad of Montferrat. The remaining refugees went to the County of Tripoli, which was under Crusader control. They were denied entrance and robbed of their possessions by raiding parties from within the city. Most of the less affluent refugees went to Armenian and Antiochian territories and were later successful in gaining entrance into Antioch. The remaining refugees fled from Ascalon to Alexandria where they were housed in makeshift stockades and received hospitable treatment from the city officials and elders. They then boarded Italian ships which arrived from Pisa, Genoa and Venice in March 1188. The captains of the ships at first refused to take the refugees since they were not being paid for them and did not have supplies for them. The governor of Alexandria who had earlier taken the oars of the ships for payment of taxes refused to grant sailing permits to the captains until they agreed. The latter then agreed to take the refugees along with them and were made to swear decent treatment and safe arrival of the refugees before they left.\n\nAfter the surrender of the city, the Church of the Holy Sephulcre was ordered to be closed for three days by Saladin while he considered what to do with it. Some of his advisers told him to destroy the Church in order to end all Christian interest in Jerusalem. Most of his advisers however told him to let the Church remain there saying that Christian pilgrimages would continue anyway because of the sanctity of the place and also reminded him of the Caliph Umar who allowed the Church to remain in Christian hands after conquering the city. Saladin rejected the destruction of the church saying that he had no intention to discourage the Christian pilgrimages to the site and it was reopened after three days on his orders. The Frankish pilgrims were allowed to enter the church upon paying a fee. To solidify Muslim claims to Jerusalem, many holy sites, including the shrine known as Al-Aqsa Mosque, were ritually purified with rose water. Christian furnishings were removed from the mosque and it was fitted with oriental carpets. Its walls were illuminated with candelabras and text from the Quran. The Orthodox Christians and Jacobites were allowed to remain and to worship as they chose. The Copts who were barred from entering Jerusalem by the Crusader kingdom of Jerusalem as they were considered heretics and atheists, were allowed to enter the city without paying any fees by Saladin as he considered them his subjects. The Coptic places of worship that were earlier taken over by the Crusaders were returned to the Coptic priests. The Copts were also allowed to visit The Church of the Holy Sephulcre and other Christian sites. The Abyssinian Christians were allowed to visit the holy places of Jerusalem without paying any fees.\n\nThe Byzantine emperor, Isaac Angelus sent a message to Saladin congratulating him on taking the city, requesting him to convert all the churches in the city back to the Orthodox church and all Christian ceremonies to be performed according to the Greek Orthodox liturgy. His request was granted and the rights of other sects were preserved. The local Christians were allowed to pray freely in their churches and the control of Christian affairs was handed over to the Byzantine patriarchate.\n\nSaladin went on to capture a number of other castles that were still holding out against him, including Belvoir, Kerak, and Montreal, and returned to Tyre to besiege it for a second time.\n\nMeanwhile, news of the disastrous defeat at Hattin was brought to Europe by Joscius, Archbishop of Tyre, as well as other pilgrims and travelers, while Saladin was conquering the rest of the kingdom throughout the summer of 1187. Plans were immediately made for a new crusade; on October 29, Pope Gregory VIII issued the bull \"Audita tremendi\", even before hearing of the fall of Jerusalem. In England and France, the Saladin tithe was enacted in order to finance expenses. The Third Crusade did not get underway until 1189, in three separate contingents led by Richard the Lionheart, King of England, Philip Augustus, King of France, and Frederick Barbarossa, Emperor of Rome. They failed to regain Jerusalem.\n\nMuch of the film \"Kingdom of Heaven\" focuses on the siege, though this version has been roundly criticized by historians.\n\n"}

The work follows the exploits of Spartacus, the leader of the slave uprising against the Romans known as the Third Servile War, although the ballet's storyline takes considerable liberties with the historical record. Khachaturian composed Spartacus in 1954, and was awarded a Lenin Prize for the composition that same year. It was first staged, with choreography by Leonid Yakobson, in Leningrad 1956, but only with qualified success since Yakobson abandoned conventional \"pointe\" in his choreography. The ballet received its first staging at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow in 1958, choreographed by Igor Moiseyev; however it was the 1968 production, choreographed by Yury Grigorovich, which achieved the greatest acclaim for the ballet. It remains one of Khachaturian's best known works and is prominent within the repertoires of the Bolshoi Theatre and other ballet companies in Russia and the former Soviet Union.\n\nPrincipal Characters:\n\n\nThe Roman consul Crassus returns to Rome from his latest conquests in a triumphal procession. Among his captives are the Thracian king Spartacus and his wife Phrygia. Spartacus laments his captivity and bids a bitter farewell to Phrygia, who is taken off to join Crassus’ harem of concubines. To entertain Crassus and his entourage, Spartacus is sent into the gladiatorial ring and is forced to kill a close friend. Horrified at his deed, Spartacus incites his fellow captives to rebellion.\n\nThe escaped captives celebrate their freedom. Meanwhile, Crassus entertains the Roman patricians with a lavish entertainment, including fights between blindfolded gladiators, one of whom is Spartacus. Spartacus unknowingly kills his friend in the arena. This induces Spartacus and his men to rebel. They disrupt the orgy and rescue the slave women, including Phrygia. Aegina insists that Crassus pursue the slave army immediately. The lovers celebrate their escape to the \"Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia\".\n\nAegina discovers Spartacus’s camp and observes the lovers emerging from their tent the next morning. Aegina sends word to Crassus, who sends his army in pursuit. Internecine struggles break out among Spartacus’s forces. Finally, Crassus’s forces discover Spartacus and impale him upon their spears. Spartacus’s closest followers recover his body and carry it off while Phrygia mourns her loss.\n\nKhachaturian extracted and arranged music from the ballet in 1955 for four orchestral suites:\n2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons; 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba; timpani, percussion ; strings.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "858406", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=858406", "title": "Technoparade", "text": "Technoparade\n\nA technoparade (the word is German) is a parade of vehicles equipped with strong loudspeakers and amplifiers playing Electronic dance music. It resembles a carnival parade in some respects, but the vehicles (called lovemobiles) are usually less elaborately decorated. Unlike some carnival parades, a technoparade does not share the tradition of bombarding the spectators with sweets. However, the revellers do occasionally throw confetti (usually larger and more sparkly than that in a carnival parade) and spray foam from the vehicles onto the crowd.\n\nNearly all of the vehicles are converted trucks. In order to power the amplifiers, the trucks are frequently equipped with an additional electrical generator. For safety reasons, horse-drawn floats are never used in technoparades: there would be a danger of horses panicking from the noise and chaos. However, there are occasional human-drawn floats equipped with generators, record players, amplifiers and loudspeakers. Some of the vehicles allow people to ride along, for a fee. For those on the sidelines, or travelling alongside on foot or bicycles, attendance is free.\n\nThe official program of a technoparade is generally not as important as what happens informally. In contrast to a carnival parade, the vehicles are little more than flatbed trucks with sound equipment, rather than elaborately decorated floats. There are usually no fireworks or other traditional elements of large celebrations. Technoparades are rarely linked to anniversaries of historical events: they usually simply take place in the summer to take advantage of the good weather.\n\nHowever, in Germany technoparades are usually officially registered as a political demonstration and thus have an appropriate motto. That way techno fans have a constitutional right to dance in the streets, and any objections from the authorities to noise and traffic obstructions are overruled and the cities also have to pay for security and cleaning up the streets afterwards.\n\nTechnoparades generally have a carnival atmosphere, where social rules (and some laws, or at least their enforcement) are at least loosened, and sometimes broken outright. An atmosphere of chaos and tolerance prevails as bystanders dance to the shifting sounds of successive vehicles rolling by them: the music blasting from one vehicle blends into that from another, which can mean a sudden change of dance style in the area where the spheres of influence overlap. The music coming from two sound trucks overlaps with approximately equal intensity, and people can dance to either of two competing rhythms. In the technoparade subculture they call this the \"Verwirrungsgebiet\" (\"overlap zone\") by analogy to a concept in radio frequency engineering.\n\nThe street allows for a type of dancing that would be literally impossible in cramped German nightclubs, and the breadth of some people's dancing is further exaggerated as they throw their clothes outwards. Some in the crowd generally climb up to any high point that can possibly be scaled, more and more as the event continues. The spirit is usually continued at after-parties in the local nightclubs, sometimes including unofficial after-parties at venues having no official connection to the parade.\n\nTechnoparades are not without problems:\n\n\n5 big technoparades of the 1990s and early 2000s:\n\nParades with a political character:\n\nSmall town or onetime moves:\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to technoparades, electronic dance events have also been organized using other moving vehicles such as boats and trams. In contrast to technoparades which are characterized by free participation on the street, in this case only the passengers on the vessels or inside the trams are part of the event. An example for a boatparade is the \"Berlin Beats & Boats\" event which takes place annually since 2009 and involves up to 14 swimming dancefloors. A regular \"Housetram\" event has been organized by Monika Kruse in Munich since 1995.\n\n\n\"This article is based on the in the .\"\n"}

It was produced and directed by Cecil B. DeMille from a screenplay by Harold Lamb, Edwin Justus Mayer and C. Gardner Sullivan adapted by Jeanie Macpherson from the novel \"Lafitte the Pirate\" by Lyle Saxon. The music score was by George Antheil and the cinematography by Victor Milner.\n\nThe film stars Fredric March as Lafitte, Franciska Gaal and Akim Tamiroff with Margot Grahame, Walter Brennan, Ian Keith, Spring Byington, Douglass Dumbrille, Beulah Bondi and Anthony Quinn in supporting roles.\n\nIt is one of the few pre-1950 sound films by Paramount to remain under that studio's ownership (partly so the remake could be filmed), whereas most films from that era had been sold to EMKA, Ltd. – now part of NBCUniversal Television Distribution – in the early television era.\n\nCecil B. DeMille remade the film in 1958 in Technicolor and VistaVision with the same title, but because of ill health, he allowed Henry Wilcoxon, his longtime friend and associate, to produce it, and the film was directed by Anthony Quinn, who was his son-in-law at the time. DeMille received no screen credit, but did make a personal appearance in the prologue to the film, much as he did in \"The Ten Commandments\". The 1958 version of \"The Buccaneer\" stars Yul Brynner, Charles Boyer and Claire Bloom, with Charlton Heston as Andrew Jackson. Douglass Dumbrille appeared in both versions and Quinn acted in the earlier version.\n\nIn the closing stages of the War of 1812, Dolly Madison (Spring Byington) evacuates the White House as the British arrive and burn Washington. Laffite (Fredric March) asks a young woman of good family, Annette de Remy (Margot Grahame), to marry him but she asks him to give up piracy first. He and his pirates set up a trading post in the swamp to sell luxury goods to New Orleans society that they have seized from non U.S. ships but have to suspend their sales when the governor, who has put a price on his head, appears with troops. Senator Crawford (Ian Keith) tells him that the British will offer him money to help them. Laffite leaves for the sea where he finds one of his captains, Captain Brown (Robert Barrat) has seized the Corinthian, a US ship, contrary to his orders not to attack American ships, burning the ship and killing the crew and passengers. Laffite's man Dominique You (Akim Tamiroff) saves the sole survivor Gretchen (Franciska Gaal), who had been made to walk the plank by Brown so no witnesses remained, and Lafitte hangs the captain for disobeying orders. Lafitte spares Gretchen despite her potential as a hostile witness and Gretchen works as his maid and falls in love with him, despite You being in love with her. The British, who are planning to attack New Orleans, offer Laffitte position and wealth if he will guide them through the swamps to the city and threaten to attack his stronghold if he will not. Although his men are willing, Lafitte's loyalty is to Louisiana and he delays answering the British, instead warning the city authorities of the British plans. On Crawford's advice, Brevet Major General Andrew Jackson (Hugh Sothern), who leads the available American forces, does not trust Lafitte and instead attacks his stronghold in order to prevent him aiding the English, capturing or killing his men, whom Lafitte has ordered not to resist. Meanwhile, Jackson determines to defend the city, though he has limited forces, despite Crawford's advice to surrender the city. Lafitte, who escaped from the attack, perseveres, appearing before Jackson in person and offering to supply him with flints and powder and provide experienced gunners to help defend the city if he will pardon his men. Jackson agrees to grant pardon after the forthcoming battle, although he will only promise to give Lafitte an hour's start from pursuit. Lafitte releases his men, in the process killing Crawford in a swordfight.\n\nThe entrenched American forces, with the help of Lafitte's artillery and gunners, mow down the advancing ranks of disciplined but over confident British troops. At the victory ball, Gretchen is recognized as a passenger on the Corinthian and as wearing clothing and jewels from Annette's sister, who was a passenger on the ship. It is consequently revealed that Lafitte's men has sunk it, killing Annette's sister along with the other passengers and crew. Lafitte accepts ultimate responsibility for the tragedy and is only saved from a lynching by Jackson, who keeps his promise of giving Lafitte an hour's start. With Annette heartbroken, Lafitte leaves, reaching his ship safely, where he finds that Gretchen has stowed away.\n\nThe 1975 film, \"The Day of the Locust\", used a fictionalized version of The Buccaneer's Hollywood premier for its climactic finale.\n\n"}

It followed the First Crusade and the Second Crusade to Finland. As the result of the attack, Viborg Castle was established and western Karelia remained under Swedish rule for over 400 years. The name of the expedition is largely anachronic, and it was a part of the Northern Crusades.\n\nAccording to Eric Chronicles, the reason behind the expedition was pagan intrusions into Christian territories. Birger Magnusson's letter of 4 March 1295 states that the motive of the crusade was long-time banditry and looting in the Baltic Sea region by Karelians, and the fact that they had taken Swedes and other travellers as captives and then tortured them. Karelians had also been engaged in a destructive expedition to Sweden in 1257 which led Valdemar to request Pope Alexander IV to decleare a crusade against them, which he agreed.\n\nAccording to Eric Chronicles, Swedes conquered 14 hundreds from the Karelians.\n\n"}
{"id": "323333", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=323333", "title": "Topsy (elephant)", "text": "Topsy (elephant)\n\nTopsy (circa 1875 – January 4, 1903) was a female Asian elephant put to death at a Coney Island, New York, amusement park by electrocution in January 1903.\n\nBorn in Southeast Asia around 1875, Topsy was secretly brought into the United States soon thereafter and added to the herd of performing elephants at the Forepaugh Circus, who fraudulently advertised her as the first elephant born in America. During her 25 years at Forepaugh, Topsy gained a reputation as a \"bad\" elephant and, after killing a spectator in 1902, was sold to Coney Island's Sea Lion Park. When Sea Lion was leased out at the end of the 1902 season and redeveloped into Luna Park, Topsy was involved in several well-publicized incidents, attributed to the actions of either her drunken handler or the park's new publicity-hungry owners, Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy. \n\nTheir end-of-the-year plans to hang Topsy at the park in a public spectacle and charge admission were stopped by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The event was cut back to invited guests and press only and Thompson and Dundy agreed to use a more sure method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered winch with poison and electrocution planned for good measure. On January 4, 1903, in front of a small crowd of invited reporters and guests Topsy was fed poison, electrocuted, and strangled, the electrocution ultimately killing her. Amongst the press that day was a crew from the Edison Manufacturing movie company who filmed the event. Their film of the electrocution part was released to be viewed in coin-operated kinetoscopes under the title \"Electrocuting an Elephant\". It is probably the first filmed death of an animal in history.\n\nThe story of Topsy fell into obscurity for the next 70 years but has become more prominent in popular culture, partly due to the fact that the film of the event still exists. In popular culture Thompson and Dundy's killing of Topsy has switched attribution, with claims it was an anti-alternating current demonstration organized by Thomas A. Edison during the War of Currents. Historians point out that Edison was never at Luna Park and the electrocution of Topsy took place ten years after the War of Currents.\n\nTopsy was born in the wild around 1875 in Southeast Asia and was captured soon after by elephant traders. \nAdam Forepaugh, owner of the Forepaugh Circus, had the elephant secretly smuggled into the United States with plans that he would advertise the baby as the first elephant born in America. At the time Forepaugh Circus was in competition with the Barnum & Bailey Circus over who had the most and biggest elephants. The name \"Topsy\" came from a slave girl character in \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\".\n\nForepaugh announced to the press in February 1877 that his circus now boasted \"the only baby elephant ever born on American soil\". The elephant trader who sold Topsy to Forepaugh also sold elephants to P.T. Barnum and tipped Barnum off about the deception. Barnum exposed the hoax publicly and Forepaugh stopped claiming that Topsy was born in America, only advertising that she was the first elephant born outside a tropical zone.\n\nAt maturity, Topsy was 10 ft high, 20 ft long, with claims she weighed between 4 and 6 tons. Over the years, Topsy gained a reputation as a \"bad\" elephant. In 1902 another event brought her again to prominence: the killing of spectator James Fielding Blount in Brooklyn, New York, at what was then the Forepaugh & Sells Brothers' Circus. Accounts vary as to what happened but the common story is that on the morning of May 27, 1902, a possibly drunk Blount wandered into the menagerie tent where all the elephants were tied in a line and began teasing them in turn, offering them a bottle of whiskey. He reportedly threw sand in Topsy's face and then burnt the extremely sensitive tip of her trunk with a lit cigar. Topsy threw Blount to the ground with her trunk and then crushed him with her head, knees, or foot. Newspaper reports on Blount's death contained what seem to be exaggerated accounts of Topsy's man-killing past, with claims that she killed up to 12 men, but with more common accounts that, during the 1900 season, she had killed two Forepaugh & Sells Brothers' Circus workers, one in Paris, Texas and one in Waco, Texas. Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, could find no record of anyone being killed by an elephant in Waco, and a handler attacked by Topsy in Paris suffered injuries but there is no record of him dying. The publicity generated by Topsy's man killing brought very large crowds to the circus to see the elephant. In June 1902 during the unloading of Topsy from a train in Kingston, New York, a spectator named Louis Dodero used a stick in his hand to \"tickle\" Topsy behind the ear. Topsy seized Dodero around the waist with her trunk, hoisted him high in the air and threw him back down before being stopped by a handler. Because of this attack the owners of Forepaugh & Sell Circus decided to sell Topsy.\n\nTopsy was sold in June 1902 to Paul Boyton, owner of Coney Island's Sea Lion Park, and added to the menagerie of animals on display there. The elephant's handler from Forepaugh, William \"Whitey\" Alt, came along with Topsy to work at the park. A bad summer season and competition with the nearby Steeplechase Park made Boyton decide to get out of the amusement park business. At the end of the year he leased Sea Lion Park to Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy who proceeded to redevelop it into a much larger attraction and renamed it Luna Park. Topsy was used in publicity, moving timbers and even the fanciful airship \"Luna\", part of the amusement ride \"A Trip to the Moon\", from Steeplechase to Luna Park, characterized in the media as \"penance\" for her rampaging ways.\n\nDuring the moving of the \"Luna\" in October 1902, handler William Alt was involved in an incident where he stabbed Topsy with a pitchfork trying to get her to pull the amusement ride. When confronted by a police officer, Alt turned Topsy loose from her work harness to run free in the streets, leading to Alt's arrest. The occurrence was attributed to the handler's drinking. In December 1902 a drunk Alt rode Topsy down the town streets of Coney Island and walked, or tried to ride, Topsy into the local police station. Accounts say Topsy tried to batter her way through the station door and \"she set up a terrific trumpeting\", leading the officers to take refuge in the cells. The handler was fired after the incident.\n\nWithout Alt to handle Topsy, the owners of Luna Park, Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy, claimed they could no longer handle the elephant and tried to get rid of her, but they could not even give her away and no other circus or zoo would take her. On December 13, 1902, Luna Park press agent Charles Murray released a statement to the newspapers that Topsy would be put to death within a few days by electrocution. At least one local paper noted that the steady drone of events and reports regarding Topsy from the park had the hallmarks of a publicity campaign designed to get the new park continually mentioned in the papers. On January 1, 1903, Thompson and Dundy announced plans to conduct a public hanging of the elephant, set for January 3 or 4, and collect a twenty-five cents a head admission to see the spectacle. The site they chose was an island in the middle of the lagoon for the old Shoot the Chute ride where they were building the centerpiece of their new park, the 200-foot Electric Tower (the structure had reached a height of 75 feet at the time of the killing). Press agent Murray arranged media coverage and posted banners around the park and on all four sides of the makeshift gallows advertising, \"OPENING MAY 2ND 1903 LUNA PARK $1,000,000 EXPOSITION, THE HEART OF CONEY ISLAND\".\n\nOn hearing Thompson and Dundy's plans, the President of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, John Peter Haines, stepped in and forbade hanging as a \"needlessly cruel means of killing [Topsy]\" and also told Thompson and Dundy they could not conduct a public spectacle and charge admission. Thompson and Dundy discussed alternatives with Haines, going over methods used in previous attempts to euthanize elephants including poisoning, but that, as well as a 1901 attempt to electrocute an elephant named Jumbo II two years earlier in Buffalo, New York, were botched. After much negotiation, which included Thompson and Dundy trying to give the elephant to the ASPCA, a method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered winch was agreed upon. They also agreed they would use poisoning and electricity as well.\n\nThe date of Topsy's demise was finally set for Sunday, January 4, 1903. The press attention the event had received brought out an estimated 1500 spectators and 100 press photographers as well as agents from the ASPCA to inspect the proceedings. Thompson and Dundy allowed 100 spectators into the park although more climbed through the park fence. Many more were on the balconies and roofs of nearby buildings, which were charging admission to see the event. The Electric Tower had been re-rigged with large ropes set up to strangle the elephant, which were inspected by the ASPCA agents to make sure they conformed to what had been agreed. The details of the electrocution part of the execution were handled by workers from the local power company, Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Brooklyn, under the supervision of chief electrician P. D. Sharkey. They spent the night before stringing power lines from the Coney Island electrical substation nine blocks to the park to carry alternating current they planned to redirect from a much larger plant in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. At Bay Ridge the staff was told to \"get an engine ready and clear a feeder and bus to Coney Island Station\". \n\nTopsy was led out of her pen into the unfinished Luna Park by Carl Goliath, an expert on elephants who formerly worked for animal showman Carl Hagenbeck. Newspaper accounts of the events noted that Topsy refused to cross the bridge over the lagoon, ignoring prodding by Goliath and even bribes of carrots and apples. The owners of Luna Park then tried to get William Alt, who would not watch the killing, to lead Topsy across the bridge, but he declined an offer of $25 to coax her to her death saying he would “not for $1000”. They finally gave up trying to get Topsy across the bridge and decided to \"bring death to her\". The steam engine, ropes, and the electrical lines were re-rigged to the spot where Topsy stood. The electricians attached copper-lined sandals connected to AC lines to Topsy's right fore foot and left hind foot so the charge would flow through the elephant's body. With chief electrician Sharkey making sure everyone was clear, Topsy was fed carrots laced with 460 grams of potassium cyanide by press agent Charles Murray who then backed away. At 2:45pm Sharkey gave a signal and an electrician on a telephone told the superintendent at Coney Island station nine blocks away to close a switch and Luna Park chief electrician Hugh Thomas closed another one at the park, sending 6,600 volts from Bay Ridge across Topsy's body for 10 seconds, toppling her to the ground. According to at least one contemporary account, she died \"without a trumpet or a groan\". After Topsy fell, the steam-powered winch tightened two nooses placed around her neck for 10 minutes. At 2:47, Topsy was pronounced dead. An ASPCA official and two veterinarians employed by Thompson and Dundy determined that the electric shock had killed Topsy. During the killing the superintendent of the Coney Island station, Joseph Johansen, became \"mixed up in the apparatus\" when he threw the switch sending power to the park and was nearly electrocuted. He was knocked out and left with small burns from the power traveling from his right arm to his left leg.\n\nAmong the press the day Topsy was put to death was a film crew from the Edison film company, possibly directed by Edwin S. Porter or Jacob Blair Smith. The film they created of the death of Topsy was 74 seconds long and shows just the electrocution. It was released to be added to the lineup of films viewable in Edison kinetoscopes within a few weeks under the title \"Electrocuting an Elephant\". This was one of many short \"actuality\" films shot by the Edison Manufacturing Company from 1897 onwards at Coney Island depicting rides, bathing scenes, diving horses, and even a film of elephants in 1903 \"Shooting the Chutes at Luna Park\". The Edison company submitted the film to the Library of Congress as a \"paper print\" (a photographic record of each frame of the film) for copyright purposes. This form of submission may have saved the film for posterity since most films and negatives of this period decayed or were destroyed over time.\n\n\"Electrocuting an Elephant\" does not seem to have been as popular as other Edison films, and could not even be viewed at Luna Park because the attraction did not have the coin-operated kinetoscopes needed to view it. The film and Topsy's story fell into relative obscurity in the intervening years, showing up as an out-of-context clip in the 1979 film \"Mr. Mike's Mondo Video\". In 1991 documentary maker Ric Burns made the film \"Coney Island\" which included a segment recounting the death of Topsy, including clips from the film \"Electrocuting an Elephant\".\n\nIn 1999 Topsy was commemorated in the Coney Island Mermaid Parade in a parade float by artist Gavin Heck. In 2003 Heck and a local arts group held a competition to select a memorial arts piece to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Topsy's death. The chosen piece, created by New Orleans artist Lee Deigaard and exhibited at the Coney Island USA museum, allowed the public to view \"Electrocuting an Elephant\" on a hand-cranked mutoscope while surrounded by hanging chains and standing on a copper plate.\n\nIn recent years portions of \"Electrocuting an Elephant\" have also appeared in movies, music videos, TV shows, and video games. The theme of Topsy's electrocution also appears in songs, in the plot-line of several novels, and in poems such as U.S. poet laureate W. S. Merwin's \"The Chain to Her Leg\".\n\nIn popular culture, Topsy is often portrayed as being electrocuted in a public demonstration organized by Thomas Edison during the War of Currents to show the dangers of alternating current.\nExamples of this view include a 2008 \"Wired\" magazine article titled \"Edison Fries an Elephant to Prove His Point\" and a 2013 episode of the animated comedy series \"Bob's Burgers\" titled \"Topsy\". The inventor had been involved with the electrocution of animals fifteen years earlier during the War of Currents, trying to demonstrate the dangers of alternating current, but the events surrounding Topsy took place ten years after the end of the \"War\". At the time of Topsy's death, Edison was no longer involved in the electric lighting business. He had been forced out of control of his company by its 1892 merger into General Electric and sold all his stock in GE during the 1890s to finance an iron ore refining venture. The Brooklyn company that still bore his name mentioned in newspaper reports was a privately owned power company no longer associated with his earlier Edison Illuminating Company. Edison himself was not present at Luna Park, and it is unclear as to the input he had in Topsy's death or even its filming since the Edison Manufacturing film company made 1200 short films during that period with little guidance from Edison as to what they filmed. Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, surmises that Edison would have been pleased by the proper positioning of the copper plates and that the elephant was killed by the large Westinghouse AC generators at Bay Ridge, but he shows no actual contact or communication between the owners of Luna Park and Edison over Topsy.\n\nTwo things that may have indelibly linked Thomas Edison with Topsy's death were the primary newspaper sources describing it as being carried out by \"electricians of the Edison Company” (leading to an eventual confusing of the unrelated power company with the man), and the fact that the film of the event (like many Edison films from that period) was credited on screen to \"Thomas A. Edison\".\n\n\n"}

The Vostok 3KA space capsule was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on April 12, 1961, with Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard, making him the first human to cross into outer space.\n\nThe orbital spaceflight consisted of a single orbit around Earth which skimmed the upper atmosphere at at its lowest point. The flight took 108 minutes from launch to landing. Gagarin parachuted to the ground separately from his capsule after ejecting at altitude.\n\nThe Space Race between the Soviet Union and the United States, the two Cold War superpowers, began just before the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, in 1957. Both countries wanted to develop spaceflight technology quickly, particularly by launching the first successful human spaceflight. The Soviet Union secretly pursued the Vostok programme in competition with the United States Project Mercury. Vostok launched several precursor unmanned missions between May 1960 and March 1961, to test and develop the Vostok rocket family and space capsule. These missions had varied degrees of success, but the final two—Korabl-Sputnik 4 and Korabl-Sputnik 5—were complete successes, allowing the first manned flight.\n\nThe Vostok 1 capsule was designed to carry a single cosmonaut. Yuri Gagarin, 27, was chosen as the prime pilot of Vostok 1, with Gherman Titov and Grigori Nelyubov as backups. These assignments were formally made on April 8, four days before the mission, but Gagarin had been a favourite among the cosmonaut candidates for at least several months.\n\nThe final decision of who would fly the mission relied heavily on the opinion of the head of cosmonaut training, Nikolai Kamanin. In an April 5 diary entry, Kamanin wrote that he was still undecided between Gagarin and Titov. \"The only thing that keeps me from picking [Titov] is the need to have the stronger person for the one day flight.\" Kamanin was referring to the second mission, Vostok 2, compared to the relatively short single-orbit mission of Vostok 1. When Gagarin and Titov were informed of the decision during a meeting on April 9, Gagarin was very happy, and Titov was disappointed. On April 10, this meeting was reenacted in front of television cameras, so there would be official footage of the event. This included an acceptance speech by Gagarin. As an indication of the level of secrecy involved, one of the other cosmonaut candidates, Alexei Leonov, later recalled that he did not know who was chosen for the mission until after the spaceflight had begun.\n\nGagarin was examined by a team of doctors prior to his flight. One doctor gave her recollection of the events in an interview with Russia Today in April 2011: \"Gagarin looked more pale than usual. He was unsociable and quiet, which was not like him at all. He would answer by nodding or a short 'yes' to all questions. Sometimes he would start humming some tunes. This was a different Gagarin. We geared him up, and hugged. And I said, 'Yuri, everything will be fine.' And he nodded back.\"\n\nUnlike later Vostok missions, there were no dedicated tracking ships available to receive signals from the spacecraft. Instead they relied on the network of ground stations, also called Command Points, to communicate with the spacecraft; all of these Command Points were located within the Soviet Union.\n\nBecause of weight constraints, there was no backup retrorocket engine. The spacecraft carried 10 days of provisions to allow for survival and natural orbital decay in the event the retrorockets failed.\n\nThe letters \"CCCP\" were hand-painted onto Gagarin's helmet by engineer Gherman Lebedev during transfer to the launch site. As it had been less than a year since U2 pilot Gary Powers was shot down, Lebedev reasoned that without some country identification, there was a small chance the cosmonaut might be mistaken for a spy on landing.\n\nThe entire mission would be controlled by either automatic systems or by ground control. This was because medical staff and spacecraft engineers were unsure how a human might react to weightlessness, and therefore it was decided to lock the pilot's manual controls. In an unusual move, a code to unlock the controls was placed in an onboard envelope, for Gagarin's use in case of emergency. Prior to the flight, Kamanin and others told Gagarin the code anyway.\n\nAt Baikonur Cosmodrome on the morning of April 11, 1961, the Vostok-K rocket, together with the attached \"Vostok 3KA\" space capsule, were transported several kilometers to the launch pad, in a horizontal position. Once they arrived at the launch pad, a quick examination of the booster was conducted by technicians to make sure everything was in order. When no visible problems were found, the booster was erected on LC-1. At 10:00 (Moscow Time), Gagarin and Titov were given a final review of the flight plan. They were informed that launch was scheduled to occur the following day, at 09:07 Moscow Time. This time was chosen so that when the capsule started to fly over Africa, which was when the retrorockets would need to fire for reentry, the solar illumination would be ideal for the orientation system's sensors.\n\nAt 18:00, once various physiological readings had been taken, the doctors instructed the cosmonauts not to discuss the upcoming missions. That evening Gagarin and Titov relaxed by listening to music, playing pool, and chatting about their childhoods. At 21:50, both men were offered sleeping pills, to ensure a good night's sleep, but they both declined. Physicians had attached sensors to the cosmonauts, to monitor their condition throughout the night, and they believed that both had slept well. Gagarin's biographers Doran and Bizony say that neither Gagarin nor Titov slept that night. Chief Designer Sergei Korolev didn't sleep that night, due to anxiety caused by the imminent spaceflight.\n\nAt 05:30 Moscow time, on the morning of April 12, 1961, both Gagarin and his backup Titov were woken. They were given breakfast, assisted into their spacesuits, and then were transported to the launch pad. Gagarin entered the \"Vostok 1\" spacecraft, and at 07:10 local time (04:10 UTC), the radio communication system was turned on. Once Gagarin was in the spacecraft, his picture appeared on television screens in the launch control room from an onboard camera. Launch would not occur for another two hours, and during the time Gagarin chatted with the mission's main CapCom, as well as Chief Designer Sergei Korolev, Nikolai Kamanin, and a few others. Following a series of tests and checks, about forty minutes after Gagarin entered the spacecraft, its hatch was closed. Gagarin, however, reported that the hatch was not sealed properly, and technicians spent nearly an hour removing all the screws and sealing the hatch again. According to a 2014 obituary, Vostok's chief designer, Oleg Ivanovsky, personally helped rebolt the hatch. There is some disagreement over whether the hatch was in fact not sealed correctly, as a more recent account stated the indication was false.\n\nDuring this time Gagarin requested some music to be played over the radio. Korolev was reportedly suffering from chest pains and worried, as up to this point the Soviet space launch rate was 50% (12 out of 24 launches had failed). Two Vostoks had failed to reach orbit due to launch vehicle malfunctions and another two malfunctioned in orbit. Korolev was given a pill to calm him down. Gagarin, on the other hand, was described as calm; about half an hour before launch his pulse was recorded at 64 beats per minute.\n\n\n\nThe automatic orientation system brought Vostok 1 into alignment for retrofire about 1 hour into the flight.\n\nAt 07:25 UT, the spacecraft's automatic systems brought it into the required attitude (orientation) for the retrorocket firing, and shortly afterwards, the liquid-fueled engine fired for about 42 seconds over the west coast of Africa, near Angola, about uprange of the landing point. The orbit's perigee and apogee had been selected to cause reentry due to orbital decay within 10 days (the limit of the life support system function) in the event of retrorocket malfunction. However, the actual orbit differed from the planned and would not have allowed descent until 20 days.\n\nTen seconds after retrofire, commands were sent to separate the Vostok service module from the reentry module (code name \"little ball\" ()), but the equipment module unexpectedly remained attached to the reentry module by a bundle of wires. At around 07:35 UT, the two parts of the spacecraft began reentry and went through strong gyrations as Vostok 1 neared Egypt. At this point the wires broke, the two modules separated, and the descent module settled into the proper reentry attitude. Gagarin telegraphed \"Everything is OK\" despite continuing gyrations; he later reported that he did not want to \"make noise\" as he had (correctly) reasoned that the gyrations did not endanger the mission (and were apparently caused by the spherical shape of the reentry module). As Gagarin continued his descent, he remained conscious as he experienced about 8 g during reentry. (Gagarin's own report states \"over 10 g\".)\n\nAt 07:55 UT, when Vostok 1 was still 7 km from the ground, the hatch of the spacecraft was released, and two seconds later Gagarin was ejected. At altitude, the main parachute was deployed from the Vostok spacecraft. Two schoolgirls witnessed the Vostok landing and described the scene: \"It was a huge ball, about two or three meters high. It fell, then it bounced and then it fell again. There was a huge hole where it hit the first time.\"\n\nGagarin's parachute opened almost right away, and about ten minutes later, at 08:05 UT, Gagarin landed. Both he and the spacecraft landed via parachute south west of Engels, in the Saratov region at . It was 280 km to the west of the planned landing site (near Baikonur).\n\nA farmer and her daughter observed the strange scene of a figure in a bright orange suit with a large white helmet landing near them by parachute. Gagarin later recalled, \"When they saw me in my space suit and the parachute dragging alongside as I walked, they started to back away in fear. I told them, don't be afraid, I am a Soviet citizen like you, who has descended from space and I must find a telephone to call Moscow!\" \n\nGagarin's flight was announced while Gagarin was still in orbit, by Yuri Levitan, the leading Soviet radio personality since the 30s. Although normally, news of Soviet rocket launches would only be aired after the fact, Sergei Korolev wrote a note to the Party Central Committee, to convince them that the announcement should be made as early as possible:\n\nWe consider it advisable to publish the first TASS report immediately after the satellite-spacecraft enters orbit, for the following reasons:\n\n(a) if a rescue becomes necessary, it will facilitate rapid organization of a rescue;\n\n(b) it precludes any foreign government declaring that the cosmonaut is a military scout.\n\nThe flight was celebrated as a great triumph of Soviet science and technology, demonstrating the superiority of the socialist system over capitalism. Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations, the scale of which was comparable to World War II Victory Parades. Gagarin was awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union, the nation's highest honour. He also became an international celebrity, receiving numerous honours and awards.\n\nApril 12 was declared Cosmonautics Day in the USSR, and is celebrated today in Russia as one of the official \"Commemorative Dates of Russia.\" In 2011, it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations.\n\nGagarin's informal reply \"poyekhali!\" became a historical phrase used to refer to the arrival of the Space Age in human history. Later it was included in the refrain of a Soviet patriotic song written by Alexandra Pakhmutova and Nikolai Dobronravov (\"He said \"let's go!\" He waved his hand\").\n\nThe Soviet press later reported that, minutes before boarding the spacecraft, Gagarin made a speech: \"Dear friends, you who are close to me, and you whom I do not know, fellow Russians, and people of all countries and all continents: in a few minutes a powerful space vehicle will carry me into the distant realm of space. What can I tell you in these last minutes before the launch? My whole life appears to me as one beautiful moment. All that I previously lived through and did, was lived through and done for the sake of this moment.\" According to historian Asif Siddiqi, Gagarin actually \"was essentially forced to utter a stream of banalities prepared by anonymous speechwriters\" taped much earlier in Moscow.\n\nOfficially, the U.S. congratulated the Soviet Union on its accomplishments. Writing for \"The New York Times\" shortly after the flight, however, journalist Arthur Krock described mixed feelings in the United States due to fears of the spaceflight's potential military implications for the Cold War, and the \"Detroit Free Press\" wrote that \"the people of Washington, London, Paris and all points between might have been dancing in the streets\" if it were not for \"doubts and suspicions\" about Soviet intentions. Other US writers reported worries that the spaceflight had won a propaganda victory on behalf of communism. President John F. Kennedy was quoted as saying that it would be \"some time\" before the US could match the Soviet launch vehicle technology, and that \"the news will be worse before it's better.\" Kennedy also sent congratulations to the Soviet Union for their \"outstanding technical achievement.\" Opinion pages of many US newspapers urged renewed efforts to overtake the Soviet scientific accomplishments.\n\nAdlai Stevenson, then the US ambassador to the United Nations, was quoted as saying, \"Now that the Soviet scientists have put a man into space and brought him back alive, I hope they will also help to bring the United Nations back alive,\" and on a more serious note urged international agreements covering the use of space (which did not occur until the Outer Space Treaty of 1967).\n\nPrime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India praised the Soviet Union for \"a great victory of man over the forces of nature\" and urged that it be \"considered as a victory for peace.\" \"The Economist\" voiced worries that orbital platforms might be used for surprise nuclear attacks. The \"Svenska Dagbladet\" in Sweden chided \"free countries\" for \"splitting up and frittering away\" their resources, while West Germany's \"Die Welt\" argued that America had the resources to have sent a man into space first but was beaten by Soviet purposefulness. Japan's \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" urged \"that both the United States and the Soviet Union should use their new knowledge and techniques for the good of mankind,\" and Egypt's \"Akhbar El Yom\" likewise expressed hopes that the cold war would \"turn into a peaceful race in infinite space\" and turn away from armed conflicts such as the Laotian Civil War.\n\nThe FAI rules in 1961 required that a pilot must land with the spacecraft to be considered an official spaceflight for the FAI record books. Although some contemporary Soviet sources stated that Gagarin had parachuted separately to the ground, the Soviet Union officially insisted that he had landed with the Vostok; the government forced the cosmonaut to lie in press conferences, and the FAI certified the flight. The Soviet Union did not admit until 1971 that Gagarin had ejected and landed separately from the Vostok descent module.\n\nWhen Soviet officials filled out the FAI papers to register the flight of Vostok 1, they stated that the launch site was Baykonur at . In reality, the launch site was near Tyuratam at , to the south west of \"Baykonur\". They did this to try to keep the location of the Space Center a secret. In 1995, Russian and Kazakh officials renamed Tyuratam Baikonur.\n\nFour decades after the flight, historian Asif Azam Siddiqi wrote that Vostok 1\nThe landing site is now a monument park. The central feature in the park is a 25 meter tall monument that consists of a silver metallic rocketship rising on a curved metallic column of flame, from a wedge shaped, white stone base. In front of this is a 3 meter tall, white stone statue of Yuri Gagarin, wearing a spacesuit, with one arm raised in greeting and the other holding a space helmet.\n\n, the \"Vostok 1\" re-entry capsule belongs to the S. P. Korolev RSC Energia Museum in Korolev City. However, during the summer of 2018 it is on a temporary loan to the Space Pavilion at the VDNKh in Moscow.\n\nIn 2011, documentary film maker Christopher Riley partnered with European Space Agency astronaut Paolo Nespoli to record a new film of what Gagarin would have seen of the Earth from his spaceship, by matching historical audio recordings to video from the International Space Station following the ground path taken by \"Vostok 1\". The resulting film, \"First Orbit\", was released online to celebrate the 50th anniversary of human spaceflight.\n\n\n\n"}
