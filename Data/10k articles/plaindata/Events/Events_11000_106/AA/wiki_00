Surrey CCC, despite The Oval having been commandeered by the military, issued a statement that spring which “hoped that some matches may be played in July and August”. It was a forlorn hope.\n\nClub cricket in the south of England went into serious decline and many clubs closed down indefinitely. In the north, efforts were made to keep the leagues alive and the Bradford League did very well indeed, with large crowds reported, especially after the Saltaire club signed the great bowler Sydney Barnes.\n\nPlum Warner, at home on sick leave, had an idea to stage services charity matches at Lord's. These would involve Dominions teams against English servicemen. Colin Blythe played in one shortly before he was killed.\n\nThe number of games increased as cricket began to be viewed as a morale booster. Birley records that \"as many as 119 services and schools games were played at Canterbury in 1917”.\n\nA Yorkshire County XII played two-day matches against teams representing the Bradford League and the Yorkshire Council league.\n\nWhen the 1918 \"Wisden\" was published, it honoured the \"School Bowlers of the Year\" - Harry Calder, John Firth, Clement Gibson, Gerard Rotherham and Greville Stevens.\n\nThe charity and holiday games continued in 1918. This was a second successive warm summer and games were again well attended, especially league games with former county or Test professionals in action.\n\nThe 1919 \"Wisden\" honoured \"Five Public School Cricketers of the Year\" - Percy Adams, Percy Chapman, Adrian Gore, Lionel Hedges and Norman Partridge. Chapman went on to captain England.\n\n\n"}

This policy was in effect until roughly 1975. By 1980, NASCAR had completely stopped tracking the year model of all the vehicles and most teams did not take stock cars to the track under their own power any more.\n\nTwo hundred laps were taken on a paved oval track spanning . The total time of the race was three hours, forty-three minutes, and thirty-six seconds. This would be the first event to ever take place at Ontario Speedway. The day of the race was February 28, 1971.\n\nAverage speed was and the pole position speed was . There were five cautions for 21 laps and the margin of victory was 8½ seconds. With an attendance of nearly seventy-nine thousand people, the race was well attended even by modern standards. Eleven notable crew chiefs were recorded as being a part of this event; including Paul Goldsmith, Richard Elder, Harry Hyde, Dale Inman, Lee Gordon and Paul Burchard.\n\nIn the 51-man entire racing grid, there were 50 Americans and only one Mexican (by the name of Pedro Rodríguez who finished in 47th due to an electrical fault). It was the 1000th race ever to be accomplished in NASCAR history. Rodríguez would retire from the NASCAR Winston Cup Series after his race here. Dean Dalton would finish in last place due to being black flagged and disqualified on lap 2. The only car in the same league with Foyt was Freddie Lorenzen until Lorenzen's engine blew and he crashed on the front straight with a fire. At the end, Petty had a chance to win, but he missed his pit under the green flag and had to come back in and finished third. Foyt won the first two Ontario races.\n\nThe total winnings of the race were considered to be $180,200 ($ when adjusted for inflation) - making it the biggest non-Daytona purse during that era. Manufacturers involved in the event included Chevrolet, Ford, Dodge, Mercury, and Plymouth. Other notable drivers included Elmo Langley, Fred Lorenzen, and Ron Hornaday, Sr. (whose son is a four-time Craftsman Truck Series champion). Marty Kinerk would also retire after this race along with Jim McElreath, Pedro Rodríguez and Johnny Steele.\n\nFailed to qualify: Jack Roberts (#20), John W.

The activation was in error. Later studies showed that residents did not evacuate, and that the most common response was to 'change the channel' or seek other confirmation.\n\nThe Emergency Alert System (EAS) is a public warning system in the United States that allows designated government authorities to suspend and preempt terrestrial radio and television broadcasts when needed to issue urgent public safety alerts. The highest priority alert that can be issued is an Emergency Action Notification (EAN), sometimes called a \"presidential alert\". An EAN sets into motion a series of events that causes all of the United States' television and radio stations to become networked together to simulcast the President of the United States, or another federal official. An Emergency Action Notification has never been used for an actual event. However, local and state-level activations of the EAS routinely occur for emergencies such as tornadoes, 911 system outages, and other, localized, exigent events.\n\nAt 2:10 p.m. on Tuesday, February 1, 2005, a state-level activation of the EAS occurred in Connecticut. A scheduled, unannounced test of the system had been planned for that day. However, the system instead informed television and radio stations that an evacuation of the state was underway. Both the Connecticut Office of Emergency Management and Governor Jodi Rell issued statements shortly after the broadcast confirming the activation had been in error and there was no evacuation underway, though clarifications were not issued until more than an hour after the transmission.\n\nOfficials initially blamed hackers for the misactivation, though an employee of the state's Office of Emergency Management later said they had accidentally registered the incorrect code prior to what should have been an EAS test, prompting the broadcast of the evacuation notification instead of the test message.\n\nAccording to media reports, the message broadcast began, \"civil authorities have issued an immediate evacuation order for all of Connecticut, beginning at 2:10 p.m. and ending at 3:10 p.m\".\n\nDespite the critical nature of the message, officials from the Connecticut State Police reported they received no calls from the public inquiring as to its authenticity or the circumstances that would require the evacuation of Connecticut. Though some local police reportedly received calls from members of the public, the message \"failed to set off a noticeable exodus into Massachusetts, Rhode Island or New York\".\n\nA study conducted after the activation discovered that 11 percent of the state's residents had received the warning while it was being broadcast. Of those persons, 63 percent reported they were \"a little or not at all concerned\" when receiving it. The most common reaction reported by residents was to seek confirmation of the emergency by changing channels; other common reactions were looking outside or consulting neighbors, and only one percent of persons surveyed who heard the broadcast actually attempted to flee Connecticut.\n\nThe most common reasons given by people for not following the evacuation orders were because no specific threat was described in the broadcast, because no specific area was mentioned other than \"the entire state of Connecticut\", and because there was no observable activity indicative of an emergency.\n\n"}
{"id": "9241757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9241757", "title": "2007 Boston Mooninite panic", "text": "2007 Boston Mooninite panic\n\nThe 2007 Boston Mooninite panic occurred on Wednesday, January 31, 2007, after the Boston Police Department and the Boston Fire Department mistakenly identified battery-powered LED placards depicting the Mooninites, characters from the Adult Swim animated television series \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\", as improvised explosive devices. Placed throughout Boston, Massachusetts, and the surrounding cities of Cambridge and Somerville, these devices were part of a guerrilla marketing advertising campaign for \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters\", a film based on \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\".\n\nThe incident led to controversy and criticism from a number of media sources, including \"The Boston Globe\", \"Los Angeles Times\", Fox News, \"The San Francisco Chronicle\", \"The New York Times\", CNN and \"The Boston Herald\", some of which ridiculed the city's response to the devices as disproportionate and indicative of a generation gap between city officials and the younger residents of Boston, at whom the ads were targeted. Several sources noted that the hundreds of officers in the Boston police department or city emergency planning office on scene were unable to identify the figure depicted for several hours until a younger staffer at Mayor Thomas Menino's office saw the media coverage and recognized the figures as cartoon characters from the TV show.\n\nAfter the devices were removed, the Boston Police Department stated in their defense that the ad devices shared \"some characteristics with improvised explosive devices,\" which they said included an \"identifiable power source, a circuit board with exposed wiring, and electrical tape.\" Investigators were not mollified by the discovery that the devices were not explosive in nature, stating they still intended to determine \"if this event was a hoax or something else entirely.\" Although city prosecutors eventually concluded there was no ill intent involved in the placing of the ads, the city continues to refer to the event as a \"bomb hoax\" (implying intent) rather than a \"bomb scare.\"\n\nReflecting back on the incident years later, various academics and media sources have characterized the reaction to the marketing campaign as a form of social panic. Author Gregory Bergman wrote in his 2008 book \"BizzWords\" that the devices were basically a self-made form of the children's toy Lite-Brite. Computer security expert Bruce Schneier wrote in his 2009 book \"Schneier on Security\" that Boston officials were \"ridiculed\" for their overreaction to the incident. In his 2009 book \"Secret Agents\", historian and communication professor Jeremy Packer discussed a phenomenon in culture called the \"panic discourse\" and described the incident as a \"spectacular instance of this panic\". In a 2012 article \"The Boston Phoenix\" called the incident the \"Great Mooninite Panic of 2007\". A 2013 publication by WGBH News wrote that the majority of Boston youth thought that the arrests of two men who placed devices, Peter \"Zebbler\" Berdovsky and Sean Stevens, were not warranted.\n\nIn November 2006, Boston area artist Zebbler (aka Peter Berdovsky) met John (aka VJ Aiwaz) in New York City. John worked for a marketing organization named Interference, Inc., and asked Berdovsky if he would be interested in working on a promotional project. Berdovsky agreed and enlisted the help of Sean Stevens for the project. Interference shipped Berdovsky 40 electronic signs. Adrienne Yee of Interference e-mailed him a list of suggested locations and a list of things not to do. According to police, the suggested locations for the devices included \"train stations, overpasses, hip/trendy areas and high traffic/high visibility areas.\" The signs were to be put up discreetly overnight. They were to be paid $300 each for their assistance.\n\nBerdovsky, Stevens, and Dana Seaver put up 20 magnetic lights in the middle of January. They dubbed the activity \"Boston Mission 1.\" While Stevens and Berdovsky put up the lights, Seaver recorded the activity on video and sent a copy to Interference. On the night of January 29, 2007, in what was called \"Boston Mission 2,\" 18 more magnetic lights were put in place. This included one under Interstate 93 at Sullivan Square in Charlestown.\n\nThe devices closely resembled the Night Writer promoted by the Graffiti Research Lab in early 2006. The devices were promotional electronic placards for the forthcoming \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters\". Each device, measuring about 1 by 1.5 feet, consisted of a printed circuit board (PCB) with black soldermask, light-emitting diodes, and other electronic components soldered to it, including numerous resistors, a few capacitors, and at least one integrated circuit package. At the bottom was a pack of four Publix brand D-cell batteries, with magnets attached to the back so the devices could be easily mounted on any ferromagnetic surface. The batteries were originally covered in black tape to blend in with the black PCB.\n\nThe LED lights were arranged to represent the Mooninite characters displaying the middle finger. Two variants were manufactured with the LEDs arranged in pixelated likenesses of Ignignokt and Err, Mooninite characters from \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\". Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley said the device \"had a very sinister appearance. It had a battery behind it, and wires.\" Others compared the displays to the Lite-Brite electric toy in appearance.\n\nOn January 31, 2007, at 8:05 a.m., a passenger spotted one of the devices on a stanchion that supports an elevated section of Interstate 93 (I-93), above Sullivan Station and told a policeman with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) of its presence. At 9 a.m., the Boston Police Department bomb squad received a phone call from the MBTA requesting assistance in identifying the device. Authorities responded with what the \"Boston Globe\" described as \"[an] army of emergency vehicles\" at the scene, including police cruisers, fire trucks, ambulances, and the Boston Police Department bomb squad. Also present were live TV crews, large crowd of onlookers, and helicopters circling overhead. Peter Berdovsky, who had placed the device, went to the scene and video recorded the situation. Berdovsky recognized the device with which the police were dealing, but made no attempt to inform the police at the scene. Berdovsky returned to his apartment and contacted Interference, the company who had hired him to place the lights. He was told by Interference that they would handle informing the police and that he should personally say nothing about the situation.\n\nDuring the preliminary investigation at the site, police found that the device shared \"some characteristics with improvised explosive devices.\" These characteristics included an identifiable power source, circuit board with exposed wiring, and electrical tape. After the initial assessment, Boston police shut down the northbound side of I-93 and parts of the public transportation system. Just after 10 a.m., the bomb squad used a small explosive filled with water to destroy the device as a precaution. MBTA Transit police Lieutenant Salvatore Venturelli told the media at the scene, \"This is a perfect example of our passengers taking part in homeland security.\" He refused to describe the object in detail because of the ongoing investigation, responding only that \"It's not consistent with equipment that would be there normally.\" Investigators were trying to determine \"if it was a hoax or something else entirely,\" according to Venturelli. Northbound I-93 reopened to traffic at about 10:05 a.m. By 10:21 a.m. it was determined to be \"some sort of hoax device,\" according to a police timeline of the events.\n\nAt 12:54 p.m., Boston police received a call identifying another device located at the intersection of Stuart and Charles Street. At 1:11 p.m. the Massachusetts State Police requested assistance from the bomb squad with devices found under the Longfellow and Boston University bridges. Both bridges were closed as a precaution, and the Coast Guard closed the river to boat traffic.\n\nAt 1:26 p.m., friends of Peter Berdovsky received an e-mail from him, which alleged that five hours into the scare, an Interference Inc. executive requested Berdovsky \"keep everything on the dl.\" Travis Vautour, a friend of Berdovsky, stated: \"We received an e-mail in the early afternoon from Peter that asked the community that he's a part of to keep any information we had on the down low and that was instructed to him by whoever his boss was.\" Two hours later, Interference notified their client, Cartoon Network. Between 2 and 3 p.m., a police analyst identified the image on the devices as an \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" cartoon character, and police concluded the incident was a publicity stunt. Turner Broadcasting System issued a statement concerning the event at around 4:30 p.m. Portions of the Turner statement read:\n\nWe regret that they were mistakenly thought to pose any danger. The packages in question are magnetic lights that pose no danger. They are part of an outdoor marketing campaign in 10 cities in support of Adult Swim's animated television show Aqua Teen Hunger Force. They have been in place for two to three weeks in Boston, New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle, Portland, Austin, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. Parent company Turner Broadcasting is in contact with local and federal law enforcement on the exact locations of the billboards. We regret that they were mistakenly thought to pose any danger.\n\nSome devices had been up for two weeks in the cities listed before the Boston incident occurred, although no permits were ever secured for the devices' installation. The marketing company responsible for the campaign, Interference, Inc., made no comment on the situation and their website was down (restored as of February 3, 2007). Berdovsky and Stevens, the individuals hired by Interference to install the signs, were arrested by Boston police during the evening of January 31, and charged with violating Chapter 266: Section 102A½ of the General Laws of Massachusetts, which states that it is illegal to display a \"hoax device\" with the motive to cause citizens to feel threatened, unsafe, and concerned. Both were held at the State Police South Boston barracks overnight and were released on $2,500 bail from the Charlestown Division of Boston Municipal Court the following morning.\n\n\"The Boston Globe\" stated that the \"marketing gambit exposes a wide generation gap,\" quoting one 29-year-old blogger as writing \"Repeat after me, authorities. L-E-D. Not I-E-D. Get it?\" The \"Globe\"s \"Brainiac\" blog was quick to credit bloggers such as Todd Vanderlin and Brian Stuart for being among the first to report on the ad's origin. The \"Brainiac\" blog earned praise from other media outlets for their timely coverage of events, even as the paper continued to report on simply \"suspicious objects\".\n\n\"Los Angeles Times\" editorials derided the reaction of Boston's officials, remarking, \"Emergency personnel and anti-terrorism squads shut down more than a dozen highways, transit stations and other locations across the city Wednesday after receiving reports about multiple suspicious devices. The slender, placemat-sized items had dozens of colored lights, exposed wires and circuitry, and were powered by a row of D batteries wrapped in black tape. In other words, they looked like an upscale version of Hasbro's Lite-Brite, a toy for artistic grade schoolers.\" Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and writer on contemporary security issues, summed up the incident as a \"non-terrorist embarrassment in Boston\".\n\n\"The Boston Herald\" stated that part of the reaction in the response could be blamed on two packages that did not blink. According to Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, phony pipe bombs were also discovered that day, one inside Tufts-New England Medical Center at 1 p.m. A security guard described \"an agitated white male\" fleeing saying, \"God is warning you that today is going to be a sad day.\" The \"Herald\" went on to characterize the placement of the devices as a \"coordinated hoax.\" Davis also mentioned other incidents of the day that may have influenced the reaction, including a Washington, D.C. metro stop being shut down due to a suspected package, and fumes emanating from a package at a post office in New York City, resulting in four people being treated there. \"It was almost like we had a kind of perfect storm of circumstances falling into place,\" Davis said.\n\nThe advertising magazine \"Brandweek\" said that the incident, which it labeled a fiasco, would cause marketers to \"steer clear of guerrilla tactics until the controversy around the \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" stunt-turned-bomb-scare in Boston dies down.\" It further said the incident \"will no doubt be followed by a reassessment of the potential price of what used to be known as a low-cost method to generate buzz.\"\n\nAccording to Fox News, fans of \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" mocked Boston officials during the press conference of Berdovsky and Stevens, calling the arrests an overreaction, while holding signs supporting the actions of the two. These signs had slogans such as \"Free Peter\" and \"1-31-07 Never Forget,\" satirizing Mayor Tom Menino's mentions of 9/11. Other local Boston residents were quoted by local papers. \"We all thought it was pretty funny,\" said one student. \"The majority of us recognize the difference between a bomb and a Lite-Brite,\" said another. One resident said that the police response was \"silly and insane,\" and that \"we're the laughingstock.\" \"Something Positive\", a webcomic written and drawn by Waltham resident R. K. Milholland, also weighed in on the issue. Bloggers on a Boston LiveJournal community commented on channel 4 footage of the first device being exploded and clearly identified it as a \"Mooninite,\" reacting in disbelief.\n\nKarl Carter of Atlanta-based Guerrilla Tactics Media said fans of the show \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" would recognize the character and think it was funny, but other people who saw the signs wouldn't get the joke. \"This is probably better set up for nightclubs and other sorts of scenarios where the people that are receiving the message, one, would know what it's about, but also two, wouldn't be frightened,\" he said. \"You know, if you put these in certain environments, like public spaces in this post-9/11 sensitivity, then of course you're going to wind up in trouble.\" \"Make\" magazine editor Phillip Torrone said the advertisers should have used better judgment, but called the Mooninite board a \"neat electronic project.\" As reported by \"Boing Boing\", the media and the State of Massachusetts insisted on maintaining the use of the words \"bomb hoax\" when describing the event, despite Turner Broadcasting Systems' firm contentions that the devices were not intended to resemble bombs and the company had no intent to arouse suspicion or panic in approving the advertising campaign.\n\nThe next day, Bax and O'Brien on the Western Massachusetts radio station WAQY weighed in, with John O'Brien saying, \"and they [the devices] were also placed in Boston over two weeks ago. I don't think the terrorism officials in Boston are very observant ... Good thing September 11 didn't happen here. We wouldn't have found it until September 20.\"\n\nOn February 27, 2007, just a month after the incident, the Boston police bomb squad responded and detonated another object that they believed to be a bomb, which turned out to be a city-owned traffic counter. In the months following the scare, stickers reading, \"Don't Panic! This is NOT A BOMB. Do not be afraid. Do not call the police. Stop letting the terrorists win,\" began to appear on Boston parking meters, ATMs, and other objects in public.\n\nOn March 18, 2007, at the annual St. Patrick's Day Breakfast in South Boston, jokes were made about the incident by Massachusetts politicians. Tom Menino said it was a good way to obtain a local aid package for the city (referring to the $1 million in \"good faith money for homeland security\" that Cartoon Network paid the city of Boston to avoid a lawsuit). Congressman Stephen Lynch joked that the Mooninites were part of a sleeper cell that also included SpongeBob SquarePants and Scrappy-Doo. State Treasurer Timothy P. Cahill held up a picture of a Mooninite with Mitt Romney's face on it, saying \"We had to blur out his real feelings about Massachusetts.\"\n\nOn February 5, 2007 state and local agencies came to an agreement with both Turner Broadcasting and Interference, Inc., to pay for costs incurred in the incident. As part of the settlement, which resolves any potential civil or criminal claims against the companies, Turner and Interference agreed to pay $2 million: $1 million to go to the Boston Police Department and $1 million to the Department of Homeland Security. This was in addition to the companies' apologies, which local authorities deemed too little as announced by Dan Conley, district attorney for Suffolk County, Massachusetts, in a speech on NECN, saying the people who are responsible for this \"reckless stunt\", are liable for the havoc it caused to both the city and the region.\n\nOn February 9, 2007, the week after this occurred, Cartoon Network's general manager and executive vice president, Jim Samples, resigned \"in recognition of the gravity of the situation that occurred under my watch\", and with the \"hope that my decision allows us to put this chapter behind us and get back to our mission of delivering unrivaled original animated entertainment for consumers of all ages\". Following Samples's resignation, Stuart Snyder was named his successor.\n\nIn total, ten cities were involved in the marketing campaign, which began two to three weeks before the incident in Boston. The NYPD contacted Interference, Inc., to request a list of 41 locations where the devices were installed. Officers were able to locate and remove only two devices, both located near 33rd Street and West Side Highway at the High Line overpass. The NYPD did not receive any complaints about the devices, according to police spokesman Paul Brown. At 9:30 p.m. on the evening of January 31, the Chicago Police Department received a list of installation locations from Interference, Inc. Police recovered and disposed of 20 of the 35 devices. Police Superintendent Philip Cline admonished those responsible for the campaign, stating, \"one of the devices could have easily been mistaken for a bomb and set off enough panic to alarm the entire city.\" Cline went on to say that, on February 1, he asked Turner Broadcasting to reimburse the city for funds spent on locating and disposing of the devices. Two men were briefly held in connection to the incident.\n\nFewer than twenty devices were found in Seattle and neither the Seattle Police Department nor the King County Sheriff's Office received 9-1-1 calls regarding them. King County Sheriff's spokesman John Urquhart stated, \"To us, they're so obviously not suspicious ... We don't consider them dangerous. In this day and age, whenever anything remotely suspicious shows up, people get concerned —and that's good. However, people don't need to be concerned about this. These are cartoon characters giving the finger.\"\n\nInterference, Inc., hired two people to distribute twenty devices throughout Philadelphia on January 11. One of these was Ryan, a 24-year-old from Fishtown, who claimed that he was promised $300 for installing the devices, only 18 of which were actually functional. Following the scare in Boston, the Philadelphia Police Department recovered three of the 18 devices. Joe Grace, spokesman for Philadelphia Mayor John F. Street, was quoted as saying, \"We think it was a stupid, regrettable, irresponsible stunt by Turner. We do not take kindly to it.\" A cease-and-desist letter was sent to Turner, threatening fines for violating zoning codes.\n\nNo devices were retrieved in Los Angeles and Lieutenant Paul Vernon of the Los Angeles Police Department stated that \"no one perceived them as a threat.\" The many Los Angeles signs were up for over two weeks before the Boston scare without incident. Police Sergeant Brian Schmautz stated that officers in Portland had not been dispatched to remove the devices, and did not plan to unless they were found on municipal property. He added, \"At this point, we wouldn't even begin an investigation, because there's no reason to believe a crime has occurred.\" A device was placed in inside 11th Ave. Liquor on Hawthorne Boulevard in Portland, where it remains. San Francisco Police Sergeant Neville Gittens said that Interference, Inc. was removing them, except for one found by art gallery owner Jamie Alexander, who reportedly \"thought it was cool\" and had it taken down after it ceased to function.\n\nBerdovsky and Stevens were arrested on the day of the incident and charged with placing a hoax device to incite panic, a felony charge that carries a five-year maximum sentence, and one count of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor. Both pleaded not guilty to the two charges and were later released on a $2,500 cash bond. At their arraignment, Assistant Attorney General John Grossman claimed that the two were trying to \"get attention by causing fear and unrest that there was a bomb in that location.\" Michael Rich, the lawyer representing both men, disputed Grossman's claim, asserting that even a VCR could be found to fit the description of a bomb-like device. Judge Leary said that it would be necessary for the prosecution to demonstrate an intent on the part of the suspects to cause a panic. The judge continued, \"It appears the suspects had no such intent ... but the question should be discussed in a later hearing.\" After making bail, Berdovsky and Stevens appeared for a live press conference. As Rich had advised them not to discuss the case, they spent the entire conference discussing and inviting press questions about hair styles of the 1970s, and ignoring any questions relating to the bomb scare.\n\nOn March 1, 2007, Senator Edward Kennedy, D-MA, introduced S.735, \"The Terrorist Hoax Improvements Act of 2007.\" It would amend\n\nOn May 11, 2007, prosecutors decided not to pursue criminal charges against Berdovsky and Stevens, in exchange for community service and a public apology. Attorney General Martha Coakley cited the difficulty in proving intent to incite panic on the part of the two men and called the deal \"an appropriate and fair resolution.\" Berdovsky and Stevens completed 80 and 60 hours of community service at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston, respectively. The incident prompted opportunists to acquire the promotional devices from other cities and auction them on eBay, with prices ranging from $500 to over $5,000 USD. Other eBay users created merchandise commemorating the event, including T-shirts, stickers, and custom LED signs.\n\nAn \"Aqua Teen Hunger Force\" episode from season five entitled \"Boston\" was produced as the series creators' response to the bomb scare, but Adult Swim pulled it to avoid further controversy. The episode has never aired, and has never been formally released to the public legally in any format. However, it was illegally leaked online in January 2015. In addition, Ignignokt appears in the Season 5 DVD sleeve, dressed up as Osama Bin Laden.\n\nAuthor Gregory Bergman wrote in his 2008 book \"BizzWords\" that the devices in question were \"essentially homemade Lite-Brites\". Bergman concluded: \"That this occurred in Boston, home to Harvard, MIT, and other famous schools of learning, is embarrassing.\" Computer security expert Bruce Schneier wrote in his 2009 book \"Schneier on Security\" that Boston officials were \"ridiculed\" for their overreaction to the incident. Schneier wrote, \"Almost no one looked beyond the finger pointing and jeering to discuss exactly why the Boston authorities overreacted so badly. They overreacted because the signs were weird.\" Schneier characterized this as a form of \"Cover Your Ass\" security.\n\nIn his 2009 book \"Secret Agents\", historian and communication professor Jeremy Packer discussed a phenomenon in culture called the \"panic discourse\" and described the incident as a \"spectacular instance of this panic\". Packer stated the discovery of the lightboards prompted \"a city government and media panic\".\n\n\"The Boston Phoenix\" published an article in 2012 looking back on the incident and interviewed Zebbler for his thoughts on its place in history. \"The Boston Phoenix\" called the incident the \"Great Mooninite Panic of 2007\". The publication concluded that the city of Boston was impacted due to the fact that it was \"oblivious\" to the Mooninite character from popular culture. Zebbler thought that history would not be likely to repeat itself with a similar event, and surmised that marketing agencies would instead be more apt to first contact law enforcement to get permission for such an event.\n\nSix years after the incident, \"WGBH News\" published an article reflecting on law enforcement reaction to the marketing campaign. WGBH summarized that the overall assessment of the government's response to the incident was critical, observing: \"What was the fallout from the scare? Both local and national media outlets derided Boston Law enforcement for failing to recognize a PR stunt gone wrong. Many young Bostonians felt the arrest of Zebbler and Stevens was an overreaction.\" The article quoted a student who pointed out the vast proportion of individuals were successfully able to determine the difference between a Lite-Brite children's toy and a bomb.\n\nWGBH requested a comment in 2013 from Zebbler to reflect back on the incident, and he stated he thought the overreaction by the government was a greater symptom of the American culture during that time period. Zebbler said he would take part in a subsequent guerilla marketing event if there was a benevolent motivation behind it.\n\nThe city of Boston hired Zebbler for its 2014 New Year's celebrations to create a light show—and paid him US$50,000 for his services. Zebbler said he felt it was an honor to be selected and help bring unity to the city. Zebbler's light show production was the centerpiece of the 2014 Boston First Night event held in Copley Square. When interviewed by the \"Boston Herald\" about the choice of Zebbler for the 2014 First Night, Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino said, \"We're a forgiving city.\" Attorney General Martha Coakley also felt that paying Zebbler for the light production in 2014 was a good choice. Coakley went on to defend the actions of law enforcement from 2007: \"This was several years ago now. Those two young men had been hired by a company to do some guerrilla advertising. At the time, particularly in its proximity to 9/11, I think the City and Boston Police were very concerned. I think we responded appropriately at the time, but I think we also saw the company immediately make compensation to the City of Boston and to the Boston Police for the efforts involved.\"\n\n\n"}

The scam involved a crime syndicate which created 118 fake clinics in 25 states and used stolen medical license numbers of real doctors and matched them to legitimate Medicare patients whose names and billing information were also stolen. The group submitted more than $163 million in claims and received $35 million of that before they were caught. Prosecutors charged 73 individuals in several states with allegations of racketeering conspiracy, bank fraud, money laundering and identity theft.\n\nA scandal surfaced involving a case to defraud the Medicaid and other healthcare programs such as Medicare. With an estimated amount to be stolen totalling $163 million of which $35 million was already acquired by the criminals, it involved more than 50 ethnic Armenians living in the United States who were arrested on October 13, 2010. The operation was run by more than 400 FBI agents. In addition to FBI, IRS and local enforcement agencies in California, Georgia, New Mexico, New York and Ohio were involved in the probe. The Justice Department has already indicted 73 individuals in New York and four other states. 44 defendants were indicted in New York, along with 10 in California, seven in New Mexico, six in Ohio and six in Georgia. According to the authorities, the Armenian-American organized crime group operated across 25 states.\n\nAccording to the authorities, the individuals acted within an organized crime enterprise run by Armen Kazarian aka PZO a Soviet Union mobster part of the Vor v zakone who arrived in the US in 1996 and resided in Glendale, California. The other alleged ringleaders, Davit Mirzoyan, 34, also from Glendale and Robert Terdjanian, 35, from Brooklyn were also indicted.\nThe authorities said most members of the organization were Armenian nationals or immigrants. The suspects have been allegedly laundering the stolen money. Prosecutors said that Kazarian travelled to New York to erase a $200,000 debt of one associate to another. When the second associate was unable to pay the fee of $100,000 for that service, his yacht was seized by Kazarian.\n\nAccording to authorities, the investigation started after they received reports about theft of personal information, including Social Security numbers of 2,900 Medicare patients in upstate New York. The government claimed the group billed Medicare from phantom clinics for unnecessary medical services, or for services which were never performed, by stealing identities of both doctors and patients. According to officials, about $35 million of the bills claimed by the network was paid out by Medicaid already. A total of 118 medical clinics in 25 states were used to defraud the US health insurance program. One of the fake clinics was run from a small office over Coney Island auto body shop. Two Queens doctors and a worker at the Lutheran Hospital in Brooklyn were part of the gangster network. The U.S. District Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, declared that the Mirzoyan–Terdjanian organization, an Armenian-run syndicate in New York and Los Angeles, used threats, intimidation and violence, operating in classic mafia style. Bharara said \"This Armenian group allegedly employed a raft of rackets, extortion, credit-card fraud, identity theft, immigration fraud, and even distribution of contraband cigarettes and stolen Viagra\"\nThe penalties range from 10 years to life in prison. The defendants will be tried in the states where they have been indicted.\n\nIn the state of Georgia, six people, Arthur Manasarian, 58; Gegham Sargsyan, 56; Khoren Gasparian, 27; Sahak Tumanyan, 43, and his wife, Hasmik Tumanyan, 38; and Toni R. Lowery, 27, five of them being ethnic Armenians were indicted for opening, operating and filing false claims to defraud Medicaid from five fake clinics in Brunswick, Savannah and Macon such as \"Brunswick Medical Supply Inc\". Sargsyan and Gasparian have escaped and are believed to have possibly left the country. \nOne of the highest amounts of the stolen taxpayer money is attributed to the state of Ohio, where the criminals of the organization billed the state for $44 million of which $20 million was paid out. All six charged with the crime by Ohio authorities are ethnic Armenians: Karen Chilyan, Eduard Oganesyan and Arus Gyulbudakyan aka Fina Markova the leader of Ohio ring have already been apprehended while Lilit Galstyan, Julieta Ghazaryan and Marine Movsisyan are still at-large.\n\nOn July 8, 2011, the leader of the criminal network Armen Kazarian pleaded guilty to racketeering charges. He faced up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing was scheduled for 6 October 2011. In February 2013, Kazarian was sentenced to 37 months in prison, to three years of supervised release and was also ordered to pay a $60,000 fine.\n\n\n"}

The ceremony was the first in the Academy's 85-year history to adopt the phrase \"The Oscars\" as the ceremony's official name during the broadcast and marketing. During the ceremony, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presented Academy Awards (commonly referred to as Oscars) in 24 categories. The ceremony was televised in the United States by ABC, and produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron and directed by Don Mischer. Actor Seth MacFarlane hosted the show for the first time.\n\nIn related events, the Academy held its 4th annual Governors Awards ceremony at the Grand Ballroom of the Hollywood and Highland Center on December 1, 2012. On February 9, 2013, in a ceremony at The Beverly Hills Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by hosts Chris Pine and Zoe Saldana.\n\n\"Life of Pi\" won four awards including Best Director for Ang Lee. \"Argo\" won three awards, including Best Picture, the fourth film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture without its director nominated. Other winners included \"Les Misérables\" also with three awards, \"Django Unchained\", \"Lincoln\", and \"Skyfall\" with two, and \"Amour\", \"Anna Karenina\", \"Brave\", \"Curfew\", \"Inocente\", \"Paperman\", \"Searching for Sugar Man\", \"Silver Linings Playbook\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty\" with one. The telecast garnered more than 40 million viewers in the United States.\n\nThe nominees for the 85th Academy Awards were announced on January 10, 2013, at 5:38 a.m. PST (13:38 UTC) at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California, by Seth MacFarlane, host of the ceremony, and actress Emma Stone. \"Lincoln\" received the most nominations with twelve total, and \"Life of Pi\" came in second with eleven.\n\nThe winners were announced during the awards ceremony on February 24, 2013. \"Argo\" was the fourth film to win Best Picture without a directing nomination, following 1927's \"Wings\", 1932's \"Grand Hotel\", and 1989's \"Driving Miss Daisy\". As co-producer of \"Argo\", George Clooney became the third individual to win Oscars for both acting and producing. By virtue of his nomination for Best Original Song in \"Ted\", host Seth MacFarlane became the first person since James Franco, who was a co-host and a Best Actor nominee during the 83rd ceremony in 2011, to host the ceremony while receiving a nomination in the same year. He was also the first singer nominee and also the first to host the show solo. \"Silver Linings Playbook\" was the fourteenth film to earn nominations in all four acting categories, and the first since \"Reds\" in 1981. At age 22, Best Actress winner Jennifer Lawrence became the second-youngest winner in that category. With his third win for Best Lead Actor, Daniel Day-Lewis became the first three-time winner in that category. He also was the sixth performer to win at least three acting Oscars. \"Amour\" was the fourth film nominated simultaneously for Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film in the same year. At age nine, Quvenzhané Wallis became the youngest nominee for Best Actress and the youngest female acting nominee overall. Meanwhile, Emmanuelle Riva (aged 85) was the oldest nominee for Best Actress. This marked the first time in Oscar history that all five nominees in an acting category (Best Supporting Actor) were all previous winners.\"Skyfall\" and \"Zero Dark Thirty\"s joint win in the Best Sound Editing category was the sixth occurrence of a tie in Oscar history.\n\nWinners are listed first, highlighted in boldface, and indicated with a double dagger ().\nThe Academy held its 4th Annual Governors Awards ceremony on December 1, 2012, during which the following awards were presented.\n\n\n\nThe following 15 films received multiple nominations:\n\nThe following six films received multiple awards:\n\nThe following individuals, listed in order of appearance, presented awards or performed musical numbers.\n\nDue to declining interest and viewership in recent ceremonies, the Academy hired a new production team in an attempt to improve ratings and revive interest in the ceremony. Reports surfaced that Academy then-president Tom Sherak approached television producer Lorne Michaels for producing duties with actor and comedian Jimmy Fallon as host. However, the telecast's broadcaster ABC objected to these selections, and both men declined afterward. With newly elected Academy president Hawk Koch assuming leadership duties, the Academy hired Neil Meron and Craig Zadan in August 2012 to produce the ceremony. Two months later, the Academy announced that actor, director, animator, singer, and comedian Seth MacFarlane would host the telecast. MacFarlane expressed that it was truly an honor and a thrill to be asked to host Academy Awards commenting, \"It's truly an overwhelming privilege to be asked to host the Oscars. My thoughts upon hearing the news were, one, I will do my utmost to live up to the high standards set forth by my predecessors; and two, I hope they don’t find out I hosted the Charlie Sheen Roast.\" In an unusual break from previous years, producers Meron and Zadan announced that the on-air telecast of the ceremony would be simply referred to as \"The Oscars\" instead of \"The 85th Annual Academy Awards\".\n\nAs evident by the numerous musical numbers featured throughout the telecast, the ceremony was billed as a salute to music and the movies. In keeping with the theme of the evening, numerous film scores from various motion pictures were played intermittently throughout the ceremony; most notable was John Williams' theme music from \"Jaws\", which was used to goad winners off the stage if their acceptance speeches were overly long. In a departure from having the orchestra perform in the same theatre, composer Williams Ross conducted the orchestra from a studio inside the Capitol Records Building a mile away.\n\nSeveral other people were involved with the telecast and its promotion. Tony Award-winning art director Derek McLane designed a new set and stage design for the ceremony. Rob Ashford served as choreographer for several musical numbers during the event. Comedians Ben Gleib and Annie Greenup served as correspondents and hosts of \"Oscar Road Trip\", a nationwide bus tour promoting the ceremony in eleven major cities across the United States. Six young film students from colleges across the country, who were selected from a contest conducted by AMPAS and MtvU, were recruited to appear onstage to deliver Oscar statuettes to the presenters during the gala.\n\nIn January 2012, AMPAS announced that it would create electronic voting system starting with the 2013 ceremony as another method for members to select the nominees and winners during the process. According to AMPAS Chief Operating Officer Ric Robertson, the implementation of the digital ballot was designed to increase participation among members in the voting process and to provide an alternative method of voting in case of emergency. Despite several Academy officials denying such reasons, some industry insiders speculated that the introduction of electronic voting was another move toward moving future awards galas to January. The deadline to submit nomination ballots was originally scheduled for January 3, but technological errors and glitches prompted the Academy to move the deadline one day later.\n\nNone of the nine Best Picture nominees were among the top ten releases in box office during the nominations. However, four of those films had already earned $100 million in American and Canadian ticket sales. At the time of the announcement of nominations on January 10, \"Lincoln\" was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $144 million in domestic box office receipts. The other three films to earn $100 million prior to nominations were \"Django Unchained\" with $112 million, \"Argo\" with $110 million, and \"Les Misérables\" with $103 million. Among the five remaining Best Picture nominees, \"Life of Pi\" was the next highest-grossing film with $91.8 million followed by \"Silver Linings Playbook\" ($35.7 million), \"Beasts of the Southern Wild\" ($11.2 million), \"Zero Dark Thirty\" ($4.4 million), and finally \"Amour\" ($311,247). The combined gross of the nine Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $620 million with an average gross of $68.9 million per film.\n\nOf the top 50 grossing movies of the year, 61 nominations went to 15 films on the list. Only \"Brave\" (8th), \"Wreck-It Ralph\" (13th), \"Lincoln\" (17th), \"Django Unchained\" (23rd), \"Argo\" (26th), \"Les Misérables\" (27th), \"Flight\" (30th), and \"Life of Pi\" (31st) were nominated for Best Picture, Best Animated Feature, or any of the directing, acting, or screenwriting awards. The other top 50 box office hits that earned nominations were \"Marvel's The Avengers\" (1st), \"Skyfall\" (4th), \"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey\" (6th), \"Ted\" (13th), \"Snow White and the Huntsman\" (15th), \"Prometheus\" (20th), and \"Mirror Mirror\" (44th).\n\nDuring the opening monologue, MacFarlane is told by James T. Kirk (William Shatner) (Captain Kirk set in the next day) about how he was going to ruin the telecast, Captain Kirk then shows him a video where MacFarlane sings a song about actresses in the movies in which they were disrobed. In response to the segment, California assemblywoman Bonnie Lowenthal and state senator Hannah-Beth Jackson expressed their disappointment at MacFarlane, ABC, and AMPAS in a press release reading, \"[T]here was a disturbing theme about violence against women being acceptable and funny. From topical jabs about domestic violence to singing about 'boobs' during a film's rape scene, Seth MacFarlane crossed the line from humor to misogyny.\" Amy Davidson of \"The New Yorker\" interpreted the song as hostile to women. Actresses Lena Dunham, Jamie Lee Curtis, Geena Davis, and Jane Fonda also commented on the jokes, with Fonda stating: \"What I really didn’t like was the song and dance number about seeing actresses' boobs. I agree with someone who said, if they want to stoop to that, why not list all the penises we’ve seen? Better yet, remember that this is a telecast seen around the world watched by families with their children and to many this is neither appropriate or funny.\"\n\nIn a press release statement, the Academy defended MacFarlane for expressing his artistic freedom, \"If the Oscars are about anything, they’re about creative freedom. We think the show's producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, and host Seth MacFarlane did a great job and we hope our worldwide audience found the show entertaining.\"\n\nThe show received a mixed reception from media publications. Some media outlets were more critical of the show. Columnist Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" commented \"By calling constant attention to the naughty factor\", MacFarlane created \"an echo chamber of outrage, working a little too hard to top himself with faux-scandalous gags about race, Jews in Hollywood, and the killing of Abraham Lincoln.\" \"The Washington Post\" television critic Hank Stuever bemoaned, \"There was nothing notably terrible about the show, and nothing particularly enthralling.\" Regarding MacFarlane's performance as host, Stuever noted, \"What you got was a combination of sicko and retro, an Oscar show hosted by someone who waited until Oscar night to discover that he's only so-so at stand-up comedy.\" Television editor Alan Sepinwall of HitFix lamented that the ceremony made for a \"frequently messy, but occasionally surprising and/or entertaining evening.\" He added that MacFarlane \"had some funny moments here and there, but he missed way more than he hit, and Frat Boy Seth quickly assumed dominance as the evening went along.\"\n\nOther media outlets received the broadcast and more positively. Tim Goodman of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised MacFarlane's performance saying that he did \"impressively better than one would have wagered.\" He also noted that he added \"plenty of niceties with a little bit of the Ricky Gervais bite-the-hand-that-feeds-you thing and worked the juxtaposition rather nicely. \"Chicago Tribune\" television critic Nina Metz lauded MacFarlane for keeping \"a solid handle on the proceedings.\" She also remarked that the host \"opened with a series of jokes that were bona fide winners, landing on just the right tone: confident but not cocksure\". Associated Press critic Frazier Moore extolled MacFarlane observing that he \"seized the camera Sunday as host of ABC's Oscarcast and proved to its vast audience that he's a ridiculously versatile entertainer, a guy who can be as charming as he is famously irreverent, even polarizing.\"\n\nThe American telecast on ABC drew in an average of 40.38 million people over its length, which was a 3% increase from the previous year's ceremony. An estimated 77.92 million total viewers watched all or part of the awards. The show also drew higher Nielsen ratings compared to the two previous ceremonies with 24.47% of households watching over a 35.65 share. In addition, the program scored its highest key demo ratings in six years with a 13.71 rating over a 33.45 share among viewers in the 18–49 demographic.\n\nIn July 2013, the ceremony presentation received nine nominations for the 65th Primetime Emmys. The following month, the ceremony didn't win any of the nominations.\n\nThe annual \"In Memoriam\" segment was presented by actor/producer/director George Clooney. The montage featured an excerpt of the main title from \"Out of Africa\" by composer John Barry. At the end of the tribute, singer Barbra Streisand sang \"The Way We Were\" from the film of the same name in tribute to composer Marvin Hamlisch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

An allied army composed of Medes and the Babylonian, rebelling against the Assyrians, together with Scythians and Cimmerians, besieged it and sacked 750 hectares of what was at that time, the greatest city in the world. This led to the destruction of the Neo-Assyrian Empire over the next three years as the dominant state in the Ancient Near East. After this battle, the archeological record shows that the capital of the once mighty Assyrian Empire was extensively de-urbanized and depopulated.\n\nBabylon became the imperial center of Mesopotamia for the first time in over a thousand years, leading to the Neo-Babylonian Empire, claiming imperial continuity as a new dynasty.\n\nThe Neo-Assyrian Empire arose in the 10th century BC and reached its peak in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, succeeding the Middle Assyrian Empire (1366-1074 BC) as the largest empire the world had yet seen. \nBy the reign of Ashurbanipal, it controlled or held in vassalage most of the nations and city-states from the Caucasus Mountains (modern Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan) in the north to Egypt, Arabia and Nubia in the south, and central Iran/Persia in the east to Cyprus and the Hellenic and Phoenician Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia and the Levant in the west.\n\nHowever, after the death of Ashurbanipal in 627 BC, the once mighty empire of Assyria was becoming increasingly volatile, with Assyria proper erupting into a series of internal civil wars. This led many of the subject states, many of which had their own political dynasties, to become restive, whereas neighbouring states and groups, such as the Medes, Persians, Babylonians, Chaldeans, Scythians, Cimmerians became increasingly hostile under the Assyrian hegemony.\n\nThe Assyrians had, by the accounts of their own records, been brutal even by the standards of the time, and thus had accumulated many hitherto impotent enemies. It had been weakened by a three front struggle to maintain power in Egypt, a costly but victorious war against the Elamites, and put down rebellions amongst their southern Mesopotamian Babylonian kinsmen, even though the core of the empire had been largely at peace. The Assyrian monarchs wrote constantly of internal danger, fear of palace intrigue, and feared a rebellion.\n\nUpon the death of Ashurbanipal, a series of bitter and bloody wars of succession occurred, weakening the empire – from 625 BC onwards, the Neo-Assyrian Empire's domination over the Middle East, Asia Minor, Caucasus and East Mediterranean gradually began to fade.\n\nAn alliance grew up of external states, such as the Chaldeans, who took advantage of the upheavals in Assyria to take control of much of Babylonia with the aid of the Babylonians themselves. They were building Babylonia into a power that is termed Neo-Babylonian. The goal was the overthrow of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. The taking of the capital, Nineveh and the transferral of the seat of Mesopotamian power to Babylon. Nineveh was not only a political capital, but home to one of the great libraries of Akkadian tablets and a recipient of tribute from across the near east. (See Library of Ashurbanipal).\n\nThe Assyrian chronicles break off in 639 BC after the destruction of Susa, the capital of Elam, and the subjugation of a rebellious Babylon ruled by Ashurbanipal's own brother Shamash-shum-ukin. Business records are missing after 631 BC. The primary sources are written afterwards by a victorious Neo-Babylonian from the reign of Nabopolassar. The primary chronicle is numbered 21901, was translated by C. J. Gadd in 1923, and can be found in the British Museum. By the Babylonian tradition set down by Herodotus much later, a Hebrew tradition attributed to Nahum, and by reference in Egyptian chronicles, all were hostile to Assyria. There are also legends that have grown up the centuries afterwards, among peoples who descend from one of the involved nationalities, including the still Mesopotamian Eastern Aramaic speaking and Christian Assyrians of northern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northwest Iran and northeast Syria.\n\nThe Medes were ruled by Cyaxares. Although initially defeated by the Assyrians, he rebuilt his army and attacked Nineveh in conjunction with other peoples.\n\nThe best recounting of the actual battle is taken from the excerpts of Persica written by Ctesias, preserved in Diodorus Siculus and Photius, whose account may have been embroidered with accounts of other battles.\n\nAccording to the Babylonian Chronicles, there was a bitter 12-year struggle between Babylon and Assyria, as well as civil wars in Assyria itself. They describe that in the tenth year of Nabopolassar (616 BC) the Babylonians defeated the Assyrian army and marched up the river sacking Mane, Sahiri and Bali-hu.\n\nThe conflict renewed the next year, with the Assyrians mustering their army and throwing the Babylonians back to Takritain. Nabopolassar stationed his army in the fortress of Takritain, and the two armies did battle there the next year. The Assyrians were beaten and retreated to Assyria.\n\nThe Babylonians then allied with the Medes, Persians, Cimmerians and Scythians. The Median army took Tarbisu, near Nineveh and encamped nearby, and then attacked the city of Assur, with the Babylonian text recounting how in 614 BC their Median ally destroyed Assur's temples and sacked the city, but their army did not reach the city until after the plundering had been done.\n\nIn 612 BC, the Bablyonians mustered the army again and joined with Cyaxares encamping against Nineveh. They laid siege to the city for three months and in August, finally broke the defenses, and plundered the city, burning it behind. The major part in the city’s downfall was played by the Medes. The Assyrian King Sin-shar-ishkun was killed in the siege. His brother Ashur-uballit II was made King of Assyria. He refused to submit, however, and successfully fought his way out of Nineveh, founding a final capital at Harran.\n\nAccording to the tradition laid out in Diodorus, the Tigris river was flooded, entering into the city. While his account is often suspect, this aspect has been given attention. The allied armies entered the area of the outer wall and there fought to enter the palace. Temples were sacked and finally the palace was burned, though this did not destroy the city, and may have aided the preservation of clay texts. According to the account in Nahum, one of the Old Testament prophets, if read as history rather than prophecy (conservative Bible scholars regard Nahum as prophecy), the battle went on for months, and fighting was in each house and street.\n\nThere would be several more campaigns against Assyria by the Neo-Bablyonians and their allies, including one against an allied Egyptian-Assyrian army. Thus while the Battle of Nineveh was a turning point in the war, Ashur-uballit II would fight on for several more years. His ultimate fate is not known or recorded - he may have been killed at the fall of Harran in 609 BC (which ended the Assyrian Empire) or at Carchemish in 605 BC (where Egypt along with remnants of the army of the former Assyrian Empire were defeated); or simply disappeared into obscurity.\n\n"}
{"id": "11597705", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11597705", "title": "Bombings of Switzerland in World War II", "text": "Bombings of Switzerland in World War II\n\nBombings of Switzerland in World War II consisted of initially sporadic bombing events that became more frequent during the later stage of World War II.\n\nSwitzerland was a neutral country during World War II, but adjacent to and at times almost completely surrounded by Axis, or Axis occupied, countries. On several occasions, Allied bombing raids hit targets in Switzerland resulting in fatalities and property damage. Such events led to diplomatic exchanges. While Allied forces explained the causes of violations as navigation errors, equipment failure, weather conditions, and pilots' errors, in Switzerland fear was expressed that some neutrality violations were intended to exert pressure on the country to end its economic cooperation with Nazi Germany. In addition to bombing raids, air attacks by individual fighter planes strafed Swiss targets toward the end of the war. The Swiss military, in turn, attacked Allied aircraft overflying Switzerland with fighters and anti-aircraft cannons.\n\nDuring World War II, Swiss airspace was violated by both sides. During the Battle of France, the Swiss Air Force shot down eleven German planes violating Swiss airspace for the loss of three planes in return. This resulted in a German threat of sanctions and retaliation, and the Swiss government decided to order an end to interceptions of foreign aircraft in Swiss airspace.\n\nWith Allied and Axis aircraft freely overflying Switzerland, over 7,000 siren alarms were initiated in Switzerland during the war. Some Allied bombers took advantage of this situation by using Swiss airspace as a safer route than enemy air space on their bombing runs to and from targets in Germany, but more often, bombers in distress preferred to descend to neutral Switzerland for asylum rather than in German territory. As a result, Switzerland ultimately interned 1,700 American airmen.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1942, Allied bombers very rarely flew over Switzerland, because the Swiss authorities, under German pressure, prescribed black-outs in order to complicate navigation for the U.S. and British air crews. As the neutral Swiss territory was safe for Allied bombers, Germany also pressured the Swiss into forcing the Allied air crews to land in Switzerland, instead of letting them continue bombing runs.\n\nIn 1943, the Swiss military began attacking Allied aircraft breaching Swiss airspace. Six Allied aircraft were shot down by Swiss Air Force fighters and four by anti-aircraft cannons, killing 36 Allied airmen. The first Allied aircraft to be shot down over were two British bombers flying low over Swiss territory on the night of July 12–13, 1943, which were shot down by Swiss anti-aircraft fire over Valais. The first American bomber shot down over Switzerland was downed near Bad Ragaz on October 1, 1943, and only three of its crew survived.\n\nOn September 5, 1944, American P-51 Mustangs escorting a damaged B-17 bomber crossed into Swiss airspace and were confronted by Swiss Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Not realizing they were over Switzerland, the P-51s attacked the Swiss Messerschmitts, shooting down one and killing its pilot, and damaging another one.\n\nAmerican and British planes bombed Switzerland about seventy times during World War II, killing 84 people. Although these bombings were attributed to error, some historians have suspected that the Allies wanted to send a warning to Switzerland for having cooperated with Germany.\n\nThe daylight bombing of Schaffhausen on 1 April 1944 by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) was the most serious of all incidents. Approximately 50 B-24 Liberators of a larger force misidentified Schaffhausen as their target Ludwigshafen am Rhein near Mannheim (about 235 km north of Schaffhausen), and dropped sixty tons of bombs on the town. Although an air raid alarm sounded in Schaffhausen, air raid sirens had been set off so many times without any attack that the locals felt safe, and many failed to take cover. A total of 40 people were killed and about 270 injured, and large parts of the town were destroyed. At the insistence of the Swiss government for an explanation, Allied investigations into the incident found that bad weather broke up the American formation over France, and that high winds that nearly doubled the ground speed of the bombers confused the navigators. (Two other widely scattered cities in Germany and France were also mistakenly bombed during the same mission.) As Schaffhausen is situated on the right bank (north side) of the Rhine river, it was apparently assumed to be the German city. By October 1944, US$4,000,000 had been paid in restitution.\n\nOn 22 February 1945, thirteen USAAF air attacks on Switzerland took place with Stein am Rhein receiving the most damage. Other places included Taegerwilen, Rafz, and Vals. Overall, 21 people were killed in these attacks.\n\nOn 4 March 1945, six USAAF B-24H bombers hit Zurich with 12.5 tons of high explosives and 12 tons of incendiaries, killing five people. The intended target had been Aschaffenburg near Frankfurt am Main (290 km north). The six bombers had gone off course, and their crews believed they were bombing Freiburg im Breisgau. At virtually the same time, other bombers dropped 12.5 tons of high explosives and five tons of incendiaries on Basel.\n\nDuring 1940, minor attacks on Geneva, Renens, Basel, and Zurich were conducted by the Royal Air Force.\n\nOn 1 October 1943, bombs were released by the USAAF over Samedan leading to property damage. 1944 saw attacks that included Koblenz, Cornol, Niederweningen, and Thayngen. Attacks in 1945 included Chiasso twice. Basel was bombed on 4 March 1945. The last air attack occurred in Brusio on 16 April 1945.\n\nRegarding the Zurich bombing, a court-martial proceeding took place in England on 1 June 1945. Col. James M. Stewart, the famous actor and wartime B-24 pilot, was the presiding officer of the trial. Accused were the lead pilot Lieutenant William R. Sincock and one of his navigators, Lieutenant Theodore Q. Balides, for violating the 96th Article of War, Sincock specifically for having \"wrongfully and negligently caused bombs to be dropped in friendly territory\". Weather conditions and equipment failure were found to be at fault; the defendants were found not guilty of criminal culpability.\n\nIn addition to the US$4 million paid by October 1944, the United States government agreed to pay 62,176,433.06 Swiss francs (then equivalent to $, or $ at current prices) to the Swiss government as full and final payment for damage to persons and property during World War II on 21 October 1949.\n\n\n\n"}

Research in CWE involves focusing on organizational, technical, and social issues.\n\nWorking practices in a collaborative working environment evolved from the traditional or geographical co-location paradigm. In a CWE, professionals work together regardless of their geographical location. In this context, e-professionals use a collaborative working environment to provide and share information and exchange views in order to reach a common understanding. Such practices enable an effective and efficient collaboration among different proficiencies.\n\nThe following applications or services are considered elements of a CWE:\n\nThe concept of CWE is derived from the idea of virtual work-spaces, and is related to the concept of e-work. It extends the traditional concept of the professional to include any type of knowledge worker who intensively uses information and communications technology (ICT) environments and tools in their working practices. Typically, a group of e-professionals conduct their collaborative work through the use of collaborative working environments (CWE).\n\nCWE refers to online collaboration (such as virtual teams, mass collaboration, and massively distributed collaboration); online communities of practice (such as the open source community); and open innovation principles.\n\nA collaborative working system (CWS) is an organizational unit that emerges any time when collaboration takes place, whether it is formal or informal, intentional or unintentional. Collaborative work systems are those in which conscious efforts have been made to create strategies, policies, and structures in order to institutionalize values, behaviors, and practices that promote cooperation among different parties in an organization so as to achieve organizational goals. A high level of collaborative capacity will enable more effective work both at the local and daily levels, and at the global and long-term levels.\n\nBeyerlein, et al. (2002) define collaboration as the collective work of two or more individuals where the work is undertaken with a sense of shared purpose and direction, that is attentive and responsive to the environment. In most organizations collaboration occurs naturally, but ill-defined work practices may create barriers to natural collaboration. The result is a loss of both decision-making quality and valuable time. Well-designed collaborative working systems not only overcome these natural barriers to communication, they also establish a cooperative work culture that becomes an integral part of the organization's structure.\n\nA collaborative work system is related to the collaborative working environment. The latter notion is more focused on technology and was issued from the concept of collaborative workspaces, driven from research within the MOSAIC Project.\n\nThe concept of 'system' in 'collaborative work system' has a self-explanatory power that is different from 'environment'. The former pertains to an integrated whole, including collaborative work conceived as a purposeful activity, whilst the later stresses the surroundings of an object – the collaborative working practices – that include a diversified number of tools and software applications mostly for remote collaboration, including video-conferencing, documents and workflow management among other technologies.\n\nA collaborative work system generally includes a collaborative working environment, but it should be conceived primarily as a set of human activities, intentional or not, that emerge every time a collaboration occurs. This enables focus on the work practices that are necessary for human collaboration and draws attention to important behavioral variables such as leadership and motivation that are not considered within the CWE definition.\n\nBesides participatory leadership, another key element of a successful collaborative work system is the availability of group collaboration technology or groupware – hardware and software tools that help groups to access and share the information the professionals need to meet, train or teach.\n\nHowever, a collaborative work system (CWS) does not necessarily require groupware support. A simple way to conceptualize the relation between the two concepts is to consider computer supported cooperative work (CSCW) as a whole consisting of a collaborative work system (CWS) supported by collaborative software or groupware.\n\nOn the other hand, a collaborative working environment which supports people in both their \"individual\" and \"cooperative\" work, whatever their geographical location transcends the notion of CSCW which deals specifically with cooperative work.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14059443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14059443", "title": "Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush", "text": "Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush\n\nThe Deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, also known as Aardakh (), Operation Lentil (, \"Chechevitsa\"; \"Vaynax Maxkaxbaxar\") was the Soviet forced transfer of the whole of the Vainakh (Chechen and Ingush) populations of the North Caucasus to Central Asia on February 23, 1944, during World War II. The expulsion, preceded by the 1940–1944 insurgency in Chechnya, was ordered by NKVD chief Lavrentiy Beria after approval by Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin, as a part of a Soviet forced settlement program and population transfer that affected several million members of non-Russian Soviet ethnic minorities between the 1930s and the 1950s.\n\nThe deportation was prepared since at least from October 1943 and 19,000 officers as well as 100,000 NKVD soldiers from all over the USSR participated in this operation. The deportation encompassed their entire nations, as well as the complete liquidation of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The demographic consequences of this eviction were catastrophic and far reaching: of the 496,000 Chechens and Ingush who were deported, at least a quarter perished. In total, the archive records show that over a hundred thousand people died or were killed during the round-ups and transportation, and during their early years in exile in the Kazakh and Kyrgyz SSR as well as Russian SFSR where they were sent to the many labor camps in the forced settlements. They were under administrative supervision of the NKVD officials during that entire time.\n\nThe exile lasted for 13 years and the survivors would not return to their native lands until 1957, after the new Soviet authorities under Nikita Khrushchev reversed many of Stalin's policies, including the deportations of nations. A local report indicated that some 432,000 Vainakhs had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR by 1961, though they faced many obstacles while trying to settle back to the Caucasus, including unemployment, lack of accommodation and ethnic clashes with the local Russian population. Eventually, the Chechens and Ingush recovered and regained the majority of the population. This eviction left a permanent scar in the memory of the survivors and their descendants. February 23 is today remembered as a day of tragedy by most of Ingushs and Chechens. Many in Chechnya and Ingushetia classify it as an act of genocide, as did the European Parliament in 2004.\n\nThe Chechens and the Ingush speak languages that are closely related and have a degree of passive intelligibility, both being Vainakh languages. The Chechen-Russian conflict is one of the longest and most protracted conflicts in modern history, spanning three centuries. Its origins date back to 1785, when the Chechens fought against Russian expansionism into the Caucasus. The Caucasus War was fought between 1817 and 1864. The Russian Empire succeeded to annex and subjugate the people of the area, but also killed or deported numerous non-Russian peoples and was responsible for the Circassian genocide. The Circassians, the Ubykh and the Abaza were subsequently resettled to the Ottoman Empire. However, other Caucasus people were affected as well. There were up to 1.5 million Chechens in the Caucasus in 1847, but as a result of this war and ensuing expulsions, their number dropped to 140,000 in 1861, and then further to 116,000 in 1867. In 1865, at least 39,000 Chechens were exiled to the Ottoman Empire by the Russian Empire.\n\nIn spite of this, the Chechens intermittently demanded a restoration of their independence and rebelled again against the Russian Empire in 1878. During the era of the USSR, throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Chechens rejected the collectivization and Sovietization policies of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. This social resistance was nicknamed the 'Chechen problem'. During this time, Moscow constantly changed their territory, until the Chechen and Ingush Autonomous Oblasts were merged into a single Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic in 1936.\n\nIn 1940, another Chechen insurgency, led by Khasan Israilov, started in Galanchozh. It was partly inspired by the resistance of Finns against the invading Soviets in the Winter War in 1939. In February 1942, Mairbek Sheripov's group rebelled in Shatoysky and Itum-Kalinsky Districts. They united with Israilov's army to rebel against the Soviet system. The Soviet Air Force bombarded the Chechen-Ingush republic in the spring of 1942 to suppress the rebellion. During World War II, the Soviet government accused Chechens and Ingush of cooperating with the Nazi invaders. The Nazis wanted to reach the Azerbaijan SSR, whose oil reserves were the goal of Case Blue (Fall Blau). On August 25, 1942, a group of German paratroopers, led by saboteur Osman Gube, landed near the village of Berezhki in the Galashkinsky district in order to organize anti-Soviet actions yet managed to only recruit 13 people in the area.\n\nThe key period of the Chechen guerilla war started in August–September 1942, when German troops approached Ingushetia, and ended in the summer-autumn of 1943, with the Soviet counter-offensive that drove the Wehrmacht from the North Caucasus. There were some 20 million Muslims in the USSR, and the Soviet government feared that a Muslim revolt could spread from Caucasus to the whole of Central Asia. In August 1942, the \"Wehrmacht\" entered North Caucasus, seizing the Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics. It also encouraged anti-Sovietism among the local populace. However, the Nazis never reached Grozny and the only town in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR they briefly occupied was Malgobek, which was inhabited by Russians.\n\nVarious historians, including Moshe Gammer, Ben Fowkes and Tony Wood, refute the Chechens' ties with the Germans, some pointing out that the Nazis stopped at the northwest outskirts of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, near Mozdok, in Northern Ossetia, and that a majority of the Vainakh never even came with a direct contact with the German army. While there were secret negotiations with the Germans near this border, the Chechen rebels pointed out that they did not favor a rule from Berlin nor from Moscow. Sheripov reportedly gave the Ostministerium a sharp warning that \"if the liberation of the Caucasus meant only the exchange of one colonizer for another, the Caucasians would consider this... only a new stage in the national liberation war\". In October 1942, Chechens assisted other volunteers to help erect a defensive barrier around Grozny. Between December 1942 and March 1943, Chechens and Ingush contributed 12 million rubles to the Soviet defensive war. 17,413 Chechens joined the Red Army and were awarded 44 decorations while a further 13,363 joined the Chechen-Ingush ASSR People's Militia, ready to defend the area from an invasion. By contrast, Babak Rezvani points out that only about a 100 Chechens collaborated with the Axis powers.\n\nOn orders from Lavrentiy Beria, the head of the NKVD, the entire Chechen and Ingush population of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic were to be deported by freight trains to remote areas of the Soviet Union. The operation was called \"Chechevitsa\" (Operation Lentil), its first two syllables pointing at its intended targets. The operation is referred to by Chechens often as \"Aardakh\" (the Exodus). This operation was being prepared and planned since at least October 1943, and included Beria's two most trusted NKVD officers, Ivan Serov and Bogdan Kobulov. Beria complained to Stalin about the \"low level of labour discipline\" among Chechens, the \"prevalence of banditry and terrorism\", the \"failure of Chechens to join the communist party\" and the \"confession of a German agent that he found a lot of support among the local Ingush\". Beria then ordered to implement the operation. When Supian Kagirovich Mollaev, the leader of the local government in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, heard about the decision, he burst into tears, but soon pulled himself together and decided to follow orders. The Chechen-Ingush Republic was never fully occupied by the Nazi army, but the repressions were officially justified by \"an armed resistance to Soviet power\". The charges of the Vainakh collaboration with the Nazis were never subsequently proven in any Soviet court.\n\nDuring World War II, 3,332,589 individuals were encompassed by Stalin's policies of deportations and forced settlements. Some of the stated reasons were allegedly to \"defuse ethnic tensions\", to \"stabilize the political situation\" or to punish people for their \"act against the Soviet authority\". According to the 1939 census, 407,690 Chechens and 92,074 Ingush were registered in the Soviet Union. On October 13, 1943, Operation Lentil commenced when about a hundred thousand troops and operative workers were moved into Checheno-Ingushetia, supposedly for mending roads and bridges. The soldiers even lived for a month inside the homes of the Chechens, who considered them guests. On February 20, 1944, Beria arrived to Grozny to supervise the operation.\nOn February 23, 1944 (on Red Army Day), the operation began. The NKVD troops went systematically from house to house to collect individuals. The inhabitants were rounded up and imprisoned in Studebaker trucks, before being packed into unheated and uninsulated freight cars. The people were given only 15 to 30 minutes to pack for the surprise transfer. According to a correspondence dated March 3, 1944, at least 19,000 officers and 100,000 NKVD soldiers from all over the USSR were sent to implement this operation. Some 500 people were deported by mistake even though they were not Chechens or Ingush. The plan envisaged that 300,000 people were to be evicted from the lowland in the first three days, while in the following days the remaining 150,000 people living in the mountain regions would be next in line.\n\nMany times, resistance was met with slaughter, and in one such instance, in the aul of Khaibakh, about 700 people were locked in a barn and burned to death by NKVD General Mikheil Gveshiani, who was praised for this and promised a medal by Beria. Many people from remote villages were executed per Beria's verbal order that any Chechen or Ingush deemed 'untransportable should be liquidated' on the spot. This meant that the old, the ill and the infirm were to either be shot or left to starve in their beds alone. The soldiers would sometimes plunder the empty homes. An eyewitness recalled the actions of the NKVD forces:\n\nThose who resisted, protested or walked too slow were shot on the spot. In one incident, NKVD soldiers climbed up Moysty, a high mountain, and found 60 villagers there. Even though their commander ordered the soldiers to shoot the villagers, they fired in the air. The commander then ordered half of the soldiers to join the villagers and another platoon shot them all. 2,016 'anti-Soviet' people were arrested, and 20,072 weapons were confiscated in the operation.\n\nThroughout the North Caucasus, about 650,000 people (according to Dalkhat Ediev, 724,297) were deported in 1943 and 1944 by the Soviet forces. 478,479 people were forcibly resettled in the Aardakh: 387,229 Chechens and 91,250 Ingush. They were loaded onto 180 special trains, about 40 to 45 persons into each freight car. A combined total of 14,200 freight cars and 1,000 flat cars were used for this mass forcible transfer from February 23 to March 13, a rate of almost 350 freight cars per day. Some 40% to 50% of the deportees were children. The Chechens were the second most numerous repressed peoples in the USSR, after the Volga Germans. Tens of thousands of Kalmyks, Balkars, Meskhetian Turks and Karachays were also deported from the region. Only Chechen and Ingush women married to non-punished peoples were spared from the deportation. However, Russian women married to Chechen or Ingush men were subject to deportation unless they divorced. Their livestock was sent to kolkhozes in Ukrainian SSR, Stavropol Krai, Voronezh and Orel Oblasts. Many of these animals perished from exhaustion.\nSome 6,000 Chechens got stuck in the mountains of the Galanzhoy district due to the snow, but this slowed the deportation only minimally: 333,739 people were evicted, of which 176,950 were sent to trains already on the first day of the operation. Beriya reported that there were only six cases of resistance, 842 were \"subject to isolation\" while 94,741 were removed from their homes by 11 p.m. on the first day of the operation. Each family was allowed to carry up to 500 kg of personal belongings on the trip. The people were transported in cattle trains that were not appropriate for human transfer, lacking electricity, heating or running water. The exiles inside endured epidemics, which lead to deaths from infections or hunger. The transit to Central Asia lasted for almost a month. Some of the epidemics included typhus. One witness, who was seven years old at the time of her family's deportation, recalls that the wagons were so full of people that there was no space to move inside them. The exiles were given food only sporadically during the transit and did not know where they were being taken to. The wagons did not even stop for bathroom breaks: the passengers had to make holes in the floor to relieve themselves. The special trains traveled almost 2,000 miles and discharged the peoples into desolate areas of Central Asia, devoid of shelters or food. 239,768 Chechens and 78,479 Ingush were sent to the Kazakh SSR, whereas 70,089 Chechens and 2,278 Ingush arrived in Kirgiz SSR. Smaller number of the remaining deportees were sent to Uzbek SSR, Russian SFSR and Tajik SSR.\nThe persecution of the Chechens did not stop there. In May 1944, Beria issued a directive ordering the NKVD to browse the entire USSR in search for any remaining members of that nation, \"not leaving a single one\". As a result, an additional 4,146 Chechens and Ingush were found in Dagestan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Krasnodar Krai, Rostov and Astrakhan Oblast. In April 1945, Beria was informed that 2,741 Chechens were deported from the Georgian SSR, 21 from the Azerbaijan SSR and 121 from Krasnodar Krai. In Moscow, only two Chechens managed to avoid eviction. All the Chechen and Ingush were discharged from the Red Army and sent to Central Asia as well. With these supplementary exiles, the number of the deported Chechens and Ingush grew to a total of 493,269. In July 1944, Beria reported an even higher figure to Stalin, claiming that a total of 496,460 Chechen and Ingush were deported. This ethnic cleansing operation was marked by an utter \"culture of impunity\". Many perpetrators of Operation Lentil were, in fact, even awarded the Suvorov First Class prize for arresting and capturing Chechens and Ingush.\n\nAs with eight other \"punished peoples\" of the Soviet Union, the Chechens were put into the regime of special settlements. There was no barb wire around their compound, but any Chechen aged 16 or over had to report to the local NKVD officials each month. Those who tried to escape were sent to the gulag. This status of a special settler was supposed to be inherited by the children of the exiles. The exiles were assigned with the heaviest tasks, such as constructing sites, mines and factories in the most inhospitable places. The only compensation they received for their work was food coupons. They would be punished if they would not do any work assigned to them. Local authorities would act harshly towards them: sometimes they would beat the children of the Chechens to death. At Krasnoyarsk about 4,000 Chechens were assigned to forced labor camps. This, combined with malnutrition due to the negligence of the authorities to provide enough food for the newly arrived exiles, led to high death rates. The settlers were not provided with adequate accommodation: on September 1, 1944, only 5,000 out of the 31,000 families in Kirgiz SSR were provided with housing. One district prepared only 18 apartments for 900 families. Some exiles had to live in unheated tents. The Chechen children had to attend school in the local language, not their own. Several cases of rebellion were reported: in Krasnoyarsk in October 1954, some 4,000 Chechens managed to escape from a gulag concentration camp. The Soviet police found and killed half of them, but the other half managed to hide in the vast outdoors.\n\nMany deportees died \"en route\", and the extremely harsh environment of exile, especially considering the amount of exposure and thermal stress, killed many more. The temperatures ih the Kazakh SSR would drop anywhere from during winter and then hit up to during summer.\n\nThey travelled in wagons that were locked from the outside, without light or water, during winter. Trains would stop and open the wagons only occasionally to bury the dead in the snow. The local people at the train stations were forbidden to help the sick passengers or to give them any medicine or water. Some Russian sources claim that 1,272 people died during this transit. In 1948, there were 118,250 special settlers in Kazakh SSR \"in extreme need in regard for food\" and authorities reported thousands of children dying from undernourishment. Food rations were fixed at only 116 grams of flour and 56 grams of grain per day for each person, which was even below the standards of the captives in Auschwitz-Birkenau camp. The local authorities in Kyrgistan set up enough supplies for only four months. One mother tried to make soup out of grass for her children. According to official Soviet reports, 608,749 Chechen, Ingush, Karachay and Balkars were registered in exile in Central Asia by 1948. The NKVD gives the statistic of 144,704 people who died in 1944–48 alone: a death rate of 23.7% per all these groups. 101,036 Chechens, Ingush and Balkars died in Kazakhstan and 16,052 in Uzbekistan. This means that their group suffered the highest death toll of all the deported peoples within the Soviet Union.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Otto Pohl estimates the combined number of deaths among Chechen and Ingush exiles during transit and confinement in special settlements by 1949 at 123,000. Out of these deaths, Chechens comprised 100,000 and Ingush 23,000. Thomas McDonell also gives a figure of at least 100,000 Chechens who died from starvation and diseases in exile, but does not give a figure for the Ingush casualties. Tom K. Wong, Associate Professor of Political Science, estimates that at least 100,000 Vainakhs died in the first three years in exile, excluding those who perished during the transit and the round-ups. Historian William Flemming released calculations giving a minimum of 132,000 Chechens and Ingush who died between 1944 and 1950. In comparison, their number of births in that period was only 47,000. Thus, the Chechen and ingush population fell from 478,479 in 1944 to 452,737 in 1948. From 1939 to 1959, the Chechen population grew by 2.5%. In comparison, between 1926 and 1939, it grew 28%. Historian Alexander Nekrich stated that the net losses of Chechens between 1939 and 1959 (after allowing for wartime losses) were 131,000, and of Ingush 12,000. German journalist Lutz Kleveman determined that 150,000 people did not survive the first four years of winter cold in Central Asia. Estimates for the maximum deaths and demographic losses of the Chechen and Ingush range from about 170,000 to 200,000, thus ranging from a quarter of the total Chechen population to nearly a third being killed in those years.\n\nThe demographer Dalkhat Ediev, in a study of casualty figures for all ethnic groups that were singled out for \"punishment\" by Stalin, found that deaths due to the deportations included 125,500 of the Chechen deportees and 20,300 of the Ingush deportees, or 30.8% of the Chechens and 21.3% of the Ingush. Meanwhile, the short-term demographic losses are estimated at 51.1% for the Chechens and 47.9% for the Ingush. He estimates that the Chechen population dropped to a low of 285,000 and the Ingush to 78,800 people in October 1948. However, despite these heavy losses, the Chechens subsequently increased their fertility rates, which is seen by some as a manifestation of their resiliance and determination to survive.\n\nThe Checheno-Ingush ASSR was dissolved and transformed into Grozny Oblast, which included also the Kizlyarsky District and Naursky Raion, and parts of it were given to North Ossetia (part of Prigorodny District), Georgian SSR and Dagestan ASSR. As a result, Georgian SSR \"grew\" from 69,300 to 76,400, North Ossetiya from 6,200 to 9,200 and Dagestan from 35,000 to 38,200 square kilometers. Names of repressed nations were totally erased from all books and encyclopedias. By the next summer, a number of Chechen and Ingush placenames were replaced with Russian ones; mosques were destroyed, and a massive campaign of burning numerous historical Nakh language books and manuscripts was near complete. Their villages were razed to the ground and their graveyards bulldozed. With the native population gone, the Chechen region experienced a huge lack of skilled workers: the local oil production industry dropped more than ten times in 1944 compared to 1943.\n\nOn November 26, 1948 the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet issued a decree which sentenced the deported nations to a permanent exile in those distant regions. This decree was not only mandatory for Chechens and Ingush, but also for Crimean Tatars, Germans, Balkars and Kalmyks. The settlers were not allowed to travel beyond three kilometers of their new place of residence. The authorities also prohibited any public mention or documentation of the deportations and its murders. Thousands of historical Vainakh texts, along with their origins, were lost when the Russians destroyed the public and private library of the peoples of Chechnya. The settlers were the target of various provocations in the Kazakh SSR: in December 1954, students in Elizavetinka taunted the Chechens as \"traitors and betrayers of motherland\". In May 1955, a worker in a coal mine engaged in a fight with a Chechen colleague in Ekibastuz. This escalated into a pogrom in which Russian hooligans even attacked a police station which sheltered the runaway Chechens. Many refugees from the Soviet Union were moved to the empty homes, including Russians, Ukrainians, Avars and Ossetians. As a consequence of this, the Russians comprised 49% of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR by 1959. By one report dated April 8, 1957, there were 415,000 Chechen and Ingush living in the Kazakh and Kyrgyz SSR, or 90,000 families. 38,500 were employed in the industry, 91,500 in agriculture, 25,000 in offices.\n\nIn 1953, the three architects of the deportation perished: shortly after Stalin died on March 5, Beria and Kobulov were arrested on June 27, 1953. They were convicted on multiple charges, sentenced to death and executed on December 23, 1953. However, these charges were unrelated to the crimes of deportations, and were merely a ploy to remove them from power. Nikita Khrushchev became the new Soviet leader and revoked numerous deportations, even denouncing Stalin. In his secret speech on February 24, 1956, Khrushchev condemned these Stalinist deportations:\n\nOn July 16, 1956 the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet adopted a decree lifting the restrictions of the legal status of Chechens, Ingush and Karachais in the special settlements. In January 1957, the Soviet Council of Ministers passed a decree allowing repressed nations to freely travel in the Soviet Union. The Chechens and Ingush were thereby rehabilitated. Their exile lasted 13 years. Some started slowly returning to the Caucasus already in 1954, but were sent back by the authorities. During 1956 alone, between 25,000 and 30,000 Chechens and Ingush returned to their homeland, some even carrying the bodies of their relatives. The Soviet government tried to give them autonomy inside Uzbekistan or to resettle them in other parts of the Caucasus, but the returnees were adamant to return to their native lands.\n\nOver 50,000 families returned in 1957. By 1959, Chechens and Ingush already comprised 41% of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. 58.2% of Chechens and 45.3% of Ingushetians returned to their native lands by that year. By 1970, this peaked with 83.0% of all Chechens and 72.1% of all Ingush being registered in the Chechen-Ingush ASSR. However, this distribution fell to 76.8% and 69.0%, respectively, by 1989. In comparison, 91.9% of all Chechens and 91.9% of all Ingush were concetrated in their titular republic in 1926. However, some Chechens stayed in Kyrgyzstan: some were afraid of the harsh long trip, some lacked the money to travel. By 2010, there were still a 100,000 Chechens living in Kazahstan.\n\nWhen the Chechens and Ingush returned to their homeland, they found their farms and infrasturcture had deteriorated. Some of the mountain regions were still a restricted zone for the returnees, which meant they had to settle in the lowlands. Worse still, they found other peoples living in their homes, and viewed these other ethnicities (Ossetians, Russians, Laks, and Avars) with hostility. Some Laks, Darghins and Avars had to be moved back to Dagestan, where they came from. Conflicts between Ossetians and Ingush in Prigorodny were sparked. The massive numbers of Vainakhs who were coming back to the Northern Caucasus took the locals by surprise: the Soviet government thus decided to temporarily halt the influx of returnees in the summer of 1957. Many Chechens and Ingush sold their homes and belongings, and quit their jobs to be able to return. A renewed ethnic conflict between Chechens and Russians was also on the rise. The Russians, angered by issues over land ownership and job competition, rioted as early as 1958. The 1958 riot was sparked by a fight between a Russian sailor and an Ingush youngster over a girl in which the Russian was fatally injured. In the next four days, the Russians formed mob riots and looted the Vainakh property, seizing government buildings and demanding either a restoration of Grozny Oblast, or a creation of a non-titular autonomy, re-deportation of the Chechens and Ingush, establishment of \"Russian power\", mass search and disarming of Chechens and Ingush, before Soviet law enforcement dispersed the rioters. Although the riot was dispersed and denounced as \"chauvinistic\", afterward the republican government made special efforts to please the Russian populace, including mass discrimination against the Chechens aimed at preserving the privileged position of the Russians.\nIn 1958, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was officially restored by a decree direct from Moscow, but in previous 1936 borders. North Ossetia kept the Psedakh and Prigorodny District, Georgian SSR kept the Daryal Gorge, amounting to 1/6 of lost land for Ingushetia, while the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was \"compensated\" with the Itum-Kalinsky and Prigorodny Districts from the Georgian SSR. This was done to dissipate the demographic impact of the 419,000 Vainakh returnees on Russians who moved there. By 1989, the 750,000 Chechens already comprised a majority (55%) of the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, while 300,000 Russians comprised 22% and 163,700 Ingush 12% of the population. Chechens started to gain control by the 1970s. Ultimately, the attempt to make Checheno-Ingushetia more multi-ethnic in order to discourage potential uprisings failed due to the higher birthrate of the Vainakhs.\n\nA local report from 1961 indicated that out of 524,000 Vainakhs, 432,000 had resettled to the Chechen-Ingush ASSR, 28,000 to Dagestan and 8,000 to North Ossetiya. However, ethnic clashes continued even in the 1960s: in 1965 alone, 16 such clashes were recorded, resulting in 185 injuries and 19 fatalities. Chechens were greatly disadvantaged after being allowed to return. There were no Chechen-language schools, leading to a lack of education of the populace (which did not universally understand Russian). According to sociologist Georgi Derluguyan, the Checheno-Ingush Republic's economy was divided into two spheres, in which the Russian sphere had all the jobs with higher salaries in the urban areas: no Chechen cadre was promoted to a top position all until 1989. In the 1960s, in order to finance their families, some forty thousand men temporarily migrated from Chechen-Ingushetia each year to find part-time jobs in Kazakhstan and Siberia, thanks to their contacts from the time of their exile. On paper, the Chechen-Ingush Republic enjoyed the same privileges as other Soviet ASSRs, but in reality it had very little actual Chechens or Ingush representing its government, which was run directly by the Russians. Despite being rich with oil, the Chechen-Ingush ASSR remained the second poorest region of the entire USSR. Yusup Soslambekov, a chairman of the Chechen parliament after 1991, lamented that his people returned from exile to their homes \"not as masters of that land but as mere inhabitants, tenants. Other people took our jobs in our factories\".\n\nThis deportation left a permanent scar in the memory of the Chechens and is today regarded by some historians as \"one of the most significant ethnic traumas of the Soviet period\". Some descendents of the peoples of the North Caucasus are even today in fear of a new deportation. One historian named it \"the central defining event in modern Chechen history\". It also played a role in the Chechen mistrust at the Kremlin and a partial motivation for the subsequent declaration of independence in 1991 and the First and Second Chechen War in the 1990s and 2000s. For instance, insurgent Shamil Basayev referred to his 40 relatives who died during the deportation while Aslan Mashadov, the President of Ichkeria, stated that February 23 remains \"one of the most tragic dates for his people\" and that the goal of the Russian government has always stayed the same: \"Chechnya without Chechens\". Historian Nikolay Bugay described the deportation as a \"perversion of Lenin's national policy and a direct disregard for the constitutional rights of the peoples\".\nIn 1991, Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev made political capital by, in a symbolic move, sending out officials to gather these lost gravestones (that had been used by the Soviets for the construction of pedestrian footpasses and foundations of pig pens), many of which had lost their original inscriptions, and to construct out of them a memorial in the center of Grozny. The memorial was made to symbolize both Chechen remorse for the past as well as the desire to, in the name of the dead ancestors, fashion the best possible Chechen Republic out of their land and work hard towards the future. It bears an engravement, reading: \"We will not break, we will not weep; we will never forget.\" Tablets bore pictures of the sites of massacres, such as Khaibakh. The memorial was damaged during the subsequent Russo-Chechen wars. It has been later moved and dismantled by Ramzan Kadyrov's pro-Russian government, sparking much controversy.\nSome think that this deportation constitutes an act of genocide according to the IV Hague Convention of 1907 and the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide of the U.N. General Assembly (adopted in 1948), including French historian and expert on communist studies Nicolas Werth, German historian Philipp Ther, Professor Anthony James Joes, American journalist Eric Margolis, Canadian political scientist Adam Jones, scholars Michael Fredholm and Fanny E. Bryan. Raphael Lemkin, a lawyer of Polonized-Jewish descent who initiated the Genocide Convention, assumed that genocide was perpetrated in the context of the mass deportation of the Chechens, Ingush, Volga Germans, Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks and Karachay. German investigative journalist Lutz Kleveman compared the deportation to a \"slow genocide\". In this case this was acknowledged by the European Parliament as an act of genocide in 2004:\n\nExperts of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum cited the events of 1944 for a reason of placing Chechnya on their genocide watch list for its potential for genocide. The separatist government of Chechnya also recognized it as genocide. Members of the Chechen diaspora and their supporters promote February 23 as World Chechnya Day to commemorate the victims.\n\nThe Chechens, along with the Ingush, Karachai and Balkars, are represented in the \"Confederation of Repressed Peoples\" (CRP), an organization that covers the former Soviet Union and aims to support and rehabilitate the rights of the deported peoples.\n\nAleksandr Solzhenitsyn's book \"The Gulag Archipelago\", published in 1973, mentioned the Chechens: \"They are a nation that refused to accept the psychology of submission... I never saw a Chechen seek to serve the authorities, or even to please them\".\n\nIn 1977 Vladimir Vysotsky wrote the song \"Летела жизнь\" (\"Letela zhizn\") devoted to the deportation.\n\nAnatoly Pristavkin wrote the 1987 novel \"The Inseparable Twins\" which deals with this deportation. Semyon Lipkin published the novel \"Dekada\" in 1983. Iunus Desheriev, a philologist of Chechen origin, published an autobiography about how he escaped the fate of his people thanks to assistance from Russian friends.\n\nOn February 19, 1989, the Yaryksu-Auch village built a monument to the victims of Stalinism.\n\nOn February 23, 1997, the \"9 towers\" memorial was unveiled in Nazran, devoted to the deportation.\n\nThe Chechen-Russian film \"Ordered to Forget\" (Приказано забыть) by Hussein Erkenov was released in 2014 and depicts the 1944 Khaibakh massacre of the Chechens.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31186303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31186303", "title": "Economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United States", "text": "Economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United States\n\nThe economic impact of illegal immigrants in the United States is challenging to measure and politically contentious. Since it is a challenging field to quantify, it leaves room for varying methodologies of study, and so the definitive results of the economic impact can change.\n\nOne possibility is that foreign workers entering the country illegally can lower wages and increase overall costs of production. This comes from the theory that when there are more illegal immigrants in the country, there will be more immigrants looking for employment because most illegal immigrants prefer to work. This increases competition among low-skilled local workers, and this will push wages for the domestic low-skilled labor market down. Simultaneously the increased supply in unskilled illegal migrants can offset technological developments and \"reduce the country's economy's competitiveness in the international market\". The opposing theory is that even though this can happen in some areas with more low-skilled employment, on the net illegal immigration increases the welfare of domestic workers because their additional consumption outweighs the costs of welfare. Along the same lines it is argued that illegal immigrants work for lower wages, then domestic residents recognize these profits and can choose to either spend or save this new revenue, so the net outcome can be decided by the net of these two economic forces. Studies have shown that overall in the long run illegal immigration benefits the country in terms of its general production, but introducing many people in the labor market can lead to income distribution that can tend towards domestic workers and immigrant workers on other occasions. The net short-term impacts of some aspects of illegal immigration can be inconclusive. Though this net effect changes, the number of immigrants crossing the border illegally is less unclear.\n\nThere were approximately 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2016, roughly unchanged from the prior year but well below the 12.2 million peak in 2007. There were an estimated 8 million unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. civilian workforce in 2016, roughly 5%. The Congressional Budget Office reported in 2007 that \"the tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to them\" but \"in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both legal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use.\" Unauthorized immigrants demand goods and services while an estimated 50 to 75 percent pay taxes. Due to cheaper labor, they contribute to lower prices in the industries where they work, such as agriculture, restaurants, and construction.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, there were 11.3 million illegal immigrants living in the United States in 2016, statistically unchanged from the previous year. The number peaked at 12.2 million in 2007, following a steady increase that began in 1990. An estimated 5.6 million unauthorized immigrants were from Mexico in 2015 and 2016, down from 6.4 million in 2009. Non-Mexicans numbered 5.7 million, indicating Mexicans are no longer the clear majority of unauthorized immigrants. The U.S. civilian workforce includes 8 million unauthorized immigrants, accounting for 5% of those working or looking for work in 2014. This number has been relatively stable since 2007, ranging between 8.0 and 8.3 million. Unauthorized immigrants represent 26% of farming and 15% of construction labor. They are primarily concentrated in six states: California, Texas, Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Illinois. About two-thirds have been in the U.S. for more than a decade.\n\nThe reduction has been driven mainly by a decrease in the number of new immigrants from Mexico, the single largest source. Net immigration from Mexico to the U.S. has stopped and possibly reversed since 2010. At its peak in 2000, about 770,000 immigrants arrived annually from Mexico; the majority arrived illegally. By 2010, the inflow had dropped to about 140,000—a majority of whom arrived as legal immigrants.\n\nAt its peak in August 2007, the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. was 12.5 million. This decreased by 1.3 million to 11.2 million by July 2008 (11%) due to either increased law enforcement or fewer job opportunities. Based on the Department of Homeland Security estimates in 2009, unauthorized immigrant population living in the United States decreased to 10.8 million in January 2009. On the whole, between 2000 and 2009, the unauthorized immigrant population grew by 27 percent.\n\nImmigrants to the U.S. are concentrated at both the high- and low-income ends of the U.S. labor market, determined largely by their educational attainment. In 2004, at the low end, half of workers age 25 and older who lacked a diploma were from Mexico and Central America. These workers were employed in jobs that required little formal education, such as construction labor and dishwashing, and on average they earned much less than did the average native worker.\n\nAn employer may benefit from the illegal status of a migrant who is desperate for work and therefore prepared to accept poor pay, usually below local norms. If paid under the table rather than using an ITIN, hiring an illegal worker also brings the employer the advantage of paying less in the way of welfare contributions and other non-wage costs.\n\nNearly every dollar earned by illegal immigrants is spent immediately, and the average wage for US citizens is $10.25/hour with an average of 34 hours per week. This means that approximately 8 million US jobs are dependent upon economic activity produced by illegal immigrant activities within the US.\n\nA 2007 review of the academic literature by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that \"over the past two decades, most efforts to estimate the fiscal impact of immigration in the United States have concluded that, in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants—both legal and unauthorized—exceed the cost of the services they use.\" While the overall fiscal impact on the US is beneficial, unauthorized immigrants have an adverse impact on the budgets of state and local governments. While cautioning that the reports are not a suitable basis for developing an aggregate national effect across all states, they concluded that:\nIRS estimates that about 6 million unauthorized immigrants file individual income tax returns each year. Research reviewed by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office indicates that between 50 percent and 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants pay federal, state, and local taxes. Illegal immigrants are estimated to pay in about $7 billion per year into Social Security. In addition, they spend millions of dollars per year, which supports the US economy and helps to create new jobs. The Texas State Comptroller reported in 2006 that the 1.4 million illegal immigrants in Texas added almost $18 billion to the state's budget, and paid $1.2 billion in state services they used.\n\nThe Social Security and Medicare contributions of illegal immigrants directly support older Americans, as illegal immigrants are not eligible to receive these services, although their children born in the United States are eligible for such benefits. Illegal immigrants pay social security payroll taxes but are not eligible for benefits. During 2006, Standard & Poor's analysts wrote: \"Each year, for example, the U.S. Social Security Administration maintains roughly $6 billion to $7 billion of Social Security contributions in an \"earnings suspense file\"—an account for W-2 tax forms that cannot be matched to the correct Social Security number. The vast majority of these numbers are attributable to illegal workers who will never claim their benefits. For 2010, the Social Security Administration estimated that illegal immigrants and their employers paid $13 billion in required social security payroll taxes.\n\nThe Social Security Administration has stated that it believes unauthorized work by non-citizens is a major cause of wage items being posted as erroneous wage reports instead of on an individual's earnings record. When Social Security numbers are already in use; names do not match the numbers or the numbers are fake, or the person of record is too old, young, dead etc., the earnings reported to the Social Security Agency are put in an Earnings Suspense file. The Social Security spends about $100 million a year and corrects all but about 2% of these. From tax years 1937 through 2003 the ESF had accumulated about 255 million mismatched wage reports, representing $520 billion in wages and about $75 billion in employment taxes paid into the over $1.5 trillion in the Social Security Trust funds. As of October 2005, approximately 8.8 million wage reports, representing $57.8 billion in wages remained unresolved in the suspense file for tax year 2003.\n\nEstimates indicate that about 4% of the school-age population is made up of children who are illegal immigrants. Many require remedial assistance in language skills, which increases costs to the public schools. During April 2006, Standard & Poor's analysts wrote: \"Local school districts are estimated to educate 1.8 million illegal children. At an average annual cost of $7,500 (averages vary by jurisdiction) per student, the cost of providing education to these children is about $11.2 billion.\" Other estimates of the costs to educate illegal children and US-born children of illegal immigrants reached $30 billion in 2009.\n\nNPR reported in March 2006 that when the wages of lower-skilled workers go down, the rest of America benefits by paying lower prices for things like restaurant meals, agricultural produce and construction. The economic impact of illegal immigration is far smaller than other trends in the economy, such as the increasing use of automation in manufacturing or the growth in global trade. But economists generally believe that when averaged over the whole economy, the effect is a small net positive. Harvard's George Borjas says the average American's wealth is increased by less than 1 percent because of illegal immigration.\n\nEconomists have different conclusions regarding the impact on wages from immigration, both legal and illegal. It is challenging to separate the impact of illegal immigration (generally workers with lower educational attainment) from immigration overall. Studies generally conclude there is a small adverse impact on the wages of lower-skilled workers from immigration and some benefit for higher-skilled workers:\n\nIn 2008, Gordon H. Hanson at University of California–San Diego and National Bureau of Economic Research performed a study to see if undocumented immigration affects native workers employment. From the study was concluded that unauthorized immigrants provide a source of manpower in agriculture, construction, food processing, building cleaning and maintenance, and other low-end jobs. Cities with a high percentage of illegal immigration were examined in this study and data showed that illegal immigrants overall impact on the US economy is small. On the other hand, US employers gain from lower labor costs and the ability to use their land, capital, and technology more productively.\n\n\"Reuters\" reported that illegal immigrants, as well as legal immigrants in the country less than five years, generally are not eligible for Medicaid. However, they can get Medicaid coverage for health emergencies if they are in a category of people otherwise eligible, such as children, pregnant women, families with dependent children, elderly or disabled individuals, and meet other requirements. The cost of this emergency care was less than 1% of Medicaid costs in North Carolina from 2001–2004 and the majority was for childbirth and related complications. \"USA Today\" reported that \"Illegal immigrants can get emergency care through Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor and people with disabilities. But they can't get non-emergency care unless they pay. They are ineligible for most other public benefits.\"\n\nBecause of the U.S. Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 (), most hospitals may not refuse anyone treatment for an emergency medical condition because of citizenship, legal status, or ability to pay. An example of the cost conflict between federal government, state and local government, and private institutions, the Immigration and Naturalization Service brings injured and ill illegal immigrants to hospital emergency rooms but does not pay for their medical care. Almost $190 million, or about 25 percent, of the uncompensated costs Southwest border county hospitals incurred resulted from emergency medical treatment provided to illegal immigrants.\n\nAt least two research studies have been done which attempt to discover the cost of health care for illegal immigrants by asking the illegal themselves.\n\nMoreover, studies have also shown that not providing illegal immigrants with a decent healthcare might actually cost the country in the long-run rather than save expenses. In 2000, researchers compared the perinatal outcomes and costs of illegal women with and without prenatal care and inferred the impact of denial of prenatal benefits to illegal immigrants in California. Nearly 10% of illegal women had no prenatal care. These women were nearly 4 times as likely to be delivered of low birth weight infants and more than 7 times as likely to be delivered of premature infants as were illegal women who had prenatal care. For every dollar cut from prenatal care, an increase of $3.33 in the cost of postnatal care and $4.63 in incremental long-term cost were expected. Elimination of publicly funded prenatal care for illegal women could save the state $58 million in direct prenatal care costs but could cost taxpayers as much as $194 million more in postnatal care, resulting in a net cost of $136 million initially and $211 million in long-term costs. Although their parents are illegal immigrants, these children are actually U.S citizens.\n\nEconomist David Card wrote in 2009 that immigration (legal and illegal) has a minor impact on income inequality and wages: \"Together these results imply that the impacts of recent immigrant inflows on the relative wages of U.S. natives are small. The effects on overall wage inequality (including natives and immigrants) are larger, reflecting the concentration of immigrants in the tails of the skill distribution and higher residual inequality among immigrants than natives. Even so, immigration accounts for a small share (5%) of the increase in U.S. wage inequality between 1980 and 2000.\"\n\nAviva Chomsky, a professor at Salem State College, states that \"Early studies in California and in the Southwest and in the Southeast...have come to the same conclusions. Immigrants, legal and illegal, are more likely to pay taxes than they are to use public services. Illegal immigrants are not eligible for most public services and live in fear of revealing themselves to government authorities. Households headed by illegal immigrants use less than half the amount of federal services that households headed by documented immigrants or citizens make use of.\"\n\nNational Public Radio (NPR) wrote in 2006: \"Supporters of a crackdown argue that the U.S. economy would benefit if illegal immigrants were to leave, because U.S. employers would be forced to raise wages to attract American workers. Critics of this approach say the loss of illegal immigrants would stall the U.S. economy, saying illegal workers do many jobs few native-born Americans will do.\"\n\nProfessor of Law Francine Lipman writes that the belief that illegal migrants are exploiting the US economy and that they cost more in services than they contribute to the economy is \"undeniably false\". Lipman asserts that \"illegal immigrants actually contribute more to public coffers in taxes than they cost in social services\" and \"contribute to the U.S. economy through their investments and consumption of goods and services; filling of millions of essential worker positions resulting in subsidiary job creation, increased productivity and lower costs of goods and services; and unrequited contributions to Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance programs.\"\n\nPEW studies on unauthorized immigrants estimates that the average household of 3.1 persons earns about $36,000 per year. This average wage is consistent with the PEW estimate that 49% of illegal immigrants have not graduated from high school.\n\nThe Congressional Budget office (CBO) estimates that people in this salary bracket (the second quintile) pay about 6.8% of their income in Federal taxes.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation estimates that the average household in the bottom quintile received $29,015 in benefits and paid $4,251 in Federal, state and local taxes. In the second quintile the average household received $24,709 in benefits and paid $9,524 in Federal, state and local taxes. In the top quintile, the average household received $21,515 in benefits and services and paid $69,704 in Federal, state and local taxes. However, it is unclear how much benefit the average unauthorized immigrant household is eligible for.\n\nIn 2013, Robert Rector and Jason Richwine of The Heritage Foundation released a study concluding that as of 2010, the \"average unlawful immigrant household\" had a net deficit (benefits received minus taxes paid) of $14,387 per household. Critics of the Rector-Richwine report \"questioned several assumptions made by the report’s authors—everything from the amount that legalization could boost earnings for immigrants to the amount of welfare they may use.\" The Heritage report purported to project costs over a 50-year period and assumed no changes to Social Security or Medicare, which prompted criticism that the study was overly speculative. The report also counted \"the cost of benefits paid to the children of those living in the U.S. illegally, even though many of those children by law are citizens.\" The methodology and conclusions of the 2013 Heritage Foundation study were sharply criticized as flawed by, among others, Alex Nowrasteh of the Cato Institute, Doug Holtz-Eakin of the American Action Forum, and Tim Kane at the Hudson Institute. Nowrasteh wrote that the Heritage report's refusal to account for GDP growth and increased economic productivity from immigration led to \"a massive underestimation of the economic benefits of immigration and diminishing estimated tax revenue.\" Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida also criticized the report.\n\nThe Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy released a report in February 2016, stating that 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States are paying annually an estimated amount of $11.64 billion in state and local taxes, \"on average an estimated 8 percent of their incomes.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "302246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302246", "title": "False pretenses", "text": "False pretenses\n\nIn criminal law, property is obtained by false pretenses when the acquisition results from intentional misrepresenting of a past or existing fact.\n\nThe elements of false pretenses are:\n(1) a false representation\n(2) of a material past or existing fact\n(3) which the person making the representation knows is false\n(4) made for the purpose of causing\n(5) and which does cause\n(6) the victim to pass title\n(7) to his property [3]\nFalse pretenses is a statutory offense in most jurisdictions; subject matter covered by statute varies accordingly, and is not necessarily limited to tangible personal property - some statutes include intangible personal property and services. For example, the North Carolina false pretense statute applies to obtaining \"any money, goods, property, services, choses in action, or any other thing of value ...\"[4]\nUnder common law, false pretense is defined as a representation of a present or past fact, which the thief knows to be false, and which he intends will and does cause the victim to pass title of his property. That is, false pretense is the acquisition of title from a victim by fraud or misrepresentation of a material past or present fact.\n\na false representation - there must be a description or portrayal of something that is false. If a person makes a statement about something that he mistakenly believes to be untrue there is no false representation. For example, if a person represents that the ring is a diamond solitaire when he believes that is in fact made of cubic zirconium he is not guilty of false pretenses if it turns out that the ring was in fact a diamond. The representation must be false at the time title passes. Thus if the representation was false when made but is true at the time title to the property passes there is no crime. For example, representing to a seller that you have funds available in your bank account to pay for the goods when in fact your account has a zero balance is not false pretenses if at the time the transaction takes place adequate funds are present in the account. The representation may be oral or written. The misrepresentation has to be affirmative. A failure to disclose a fact does not fit this misrepresentation in common law, unless there is a fiduciary duty between the thief and victim. Moreover, opinion and puffing are not considered misrepresentation as they color the facts but do not misrepresent them.\n\nof a material past or existing fact - the representation must relate to a material past or existing fact. A representation concerning a future state of facts is not sufficient. Nor is merely an expression of opinion.\n\nwhich the person making the representation knows is false - A mistaken representation about some past or existing state of facts is not sufficient for false pretense.\n\nmade for the purpose of causing and which does cause - It is essential that the victim of the false pretenses must actually be deceived by the misrepresentation: the victim must transfer title to the property in reliance on the representation; and the victim being deceived must be a major (if not the only) reason for the victim's transferring title to the defendant. Simply making a false promise or statement is not sufficient. It is not a defense to false pretenses charge that a reasonable person would not have been deceived by the false representation. No matter how gullible the victim, if he/she was in fact deceived the offense has been committed. On the other hand, the offense requires the victim believe the representation to be true. If the person to whom the representation has been made has doubts or serious misgivings about the truth of the representation but nonetheless goes through with the transaction he has not been deceived - he has basically assumed the risk of a false representation.\n\nTitle passes - False pretense is conventionally referred to as a crime against “title” and \"title\" must pass from the victim to the perpetrator for the crime to be complete. However, this is not to be taken literally for the simple reason that a person who obtains ownership of property by deceit does not obtain full title to the property; only a voidable title. False pretense applies to situations where the wrongdoer by deceit obtains “title or ownership – or whatever property interest the victim had in the chattel, if it was less than title.” If the victim has an interest is the property less than full title the acquisition of that interest through false representation can be false pretenses unless the only interest the person has is possession of the property. In such case the crime would be larceny by trick rather than false pretenses. Larceny by Trick also applies to situations where the wrongdoer by deceit obtains possession only, with the victim retaining ownership or some superior interest in the chattel.[5] Determining whether the victim obtained title or possession can present problems. Generally a sell or conditional sell is sufficient to pass title for purposes of false pretenses whereas lending property does not involve a transfer of title. Note that if property is falsely obtained for a specific purpose - for example money to buy a car that does not exist - the crime is larceny by trick rather than false pretenses because the victim intended to pass title to the money only upon completion of the transaction; until such time the victim intended to deliver possession only.\nThe essential distinction between false pretenses and larceny and embezzlement is that false pretenses requires that the victim pass title to the defendant whereas the other offenses do not.\nThe determination as to whether the offense is larceny or false pretenses can have significant effect on the ability of true owner to reclaim the appropriated property. If false pretenses, a bona fide purchaser for value would acquire title superior to the victim; whereas, if the crime is larceny a purchaser from the wrongdoer, bona fide or otherwise, would not acquire any title to the property and would have to return the property to the victim.\n\nUnited States statutes on this subject are mainly copied from the English statutes, and the courts there in a general way follow the English interpretations. The statutes of each state must be consulted. Under federal law, obtaining money or property through false pretenses as part of a scheme or artifice to defraud, and using means of interstate commerce such as a telephone, is illegal under title 18 USC section 1343; the crime is usually referred to as \"Wire Fraud.\" There are Federal laws providing penalties for false personation of the lawful owner of public stocks, &c., or of persons entitled to pensions, prize money, &c., or the false making of any order purporting to be a money order.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first “modern” false pretense statute was enacted by Parliament in 1757. The statute prohibited obtaining “money, goods, wares, or merchandise” by “false pretence.” The first general embezzlement statute was enacted by Parliament in 1799. Neither of these statutes were part of the American common law. However, most states passed laws similar to the English statutes.\n\nIn Arizona, obtaining money or property by falsely impersonating another is punishable as for larceny. Obtaining credit by false pretenses as to wealth and mercantile character is punishable by six months imprisonment and a fine not exceeding three times the value of the money or property obtained.\n\nIn Illinois, whoever by any false representation or writing signed by him, of his own respectability, wealth or mercantile correspondence or connections, obtain; credit and thereby defrauds any person of money, goods, chattels or any valuable thing, or who procures another to make a false report of his honesty, wealth, &c., shall return the money, goods, &c., and be fined and imprisoned for a term not exceeding one year. Obtaining money or property by bogus cheques, the confidence game, or three card monte, sleight of hand, fortune-telling, &c., is punishable by imprisonment for from one to ten years. Obtaining goods from warehouse, mill or wharf by fraudulent receipt wrongly stating amount of goods deposited by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than ten years. Fraudulent use of railroad passes is a misdemeanor. A person who knowingly personates a public official, a veteran, the recipient of a medal, the holder of a title, or profits from a false academic degree is unlawful.\n\nIn Massachusetts it is simple larceny to obtain by false pretenses the money or personal chattel of another. Obtaining by false pretence the making, acceptance or endorsement of a bill of exchange or promissory note, the release or substitution of collateral or other security, an extension of time for payment of an obligation, or the release or alteration of the obligation of a written contract, is larceny and punishable by imprisonment.\n\nIn New York, obtaining property by false pretenses, felonious breach of trust and embezzlement are included in the term larceny,), but the methods of proof required to establish each crime remain as before the code. Obtaining lodging and food on credit at hotel or lodging house with intent to defraud is a misdemeanor. Purchase of property by false pretences as to persons means or ability to pay is not criminal when in writing signed by the party to be charged\n\nFalse pretences as a concept in the criminal law is no longer used in English law. It used to refer to the means whereby the defendant obtained any chattel, money or valuable security from any other person with intent to defraud, indictable as a misdemeanour under the Larceny Act 1861 as amended by the Larceny Act 1916. The modern concept is a deception and it is used as the common basis of the \"actus reus\" (the Latin for \"guilty act\") in the deception offences under the Theft Act 1968 and in the Theft Act 1978. The Fraud Act 2006 repealed these latter two Acts and replaced deception offences with other offences.\n\nThe three major theft offences were larceny, embezzlement and false pretences. Larceny was a common law offence (created by judicial action) while embezzlement and false pretences were statutory offences (created by legislative action). Larceny is by far the oldest. The elements of larceny were \"well-settled\" by the thirteenth century. The only other theft offence then existing was cheat which was a misdemeanor. Cheat was a primitive version of the crime of false pretences and involved obtaining property by the use of false weights or measures. In 1541 a statute was enacted by Parliament that made it a misdemeanor to obtain property by a false token or a counterfeit letter \"made in any other man’s name.\" This statute did not cover obtaining property by the use false spoken words. The first \"modern\" false pretence statute was enacted by Parliament in 1757. The statute prohibited obtaining \"money, goods, wares, or merchandise\" by \"false pretence.\" The first general embezzlement statute was enacted by Parliament in 1799.\n\nThe broad distinction between this offence and larceny is that in the former the owner intends to part with his property, in the latter he does not. This offence dates as a statutory crime practically from 1756. At common law the only remedy originally available for an owner who had been deprived of his goods by fraud was an indictment for the crime of cheating, or a civil action for deceit. These remedies were insufficient to cover all cases where money or other properties had been obtained by false pretences, and the offence was first partially created by a statute of Henry VIII (1541), which enacted that if any person should falsely and deceitfully obtain any money, goods, &c., by means of any false token or counterfeit letter made in any other man's name, the offender should suffer any punishment other than death, at the discretion of the judge. The scope of the offence was enlarged to include practically all false pretences by the Act of 1756, the provisions of which were embodied in the Larceny Act 1861.\n\nThe pretence must be a false pretence of some existing fact, made for the purpose of inducing the prosecutor to part with his property (e.g. it was held not to be a false pretence to promise to pay for goods on delivery), and it may be by either words or conduct. The property, too, must have been actually obtained by the false pretence. The owner must be induced by the pretence to make over the absolute and immediate ownership of the goods, otherwise it is larceny by means of a trick. It is not always easy, however, to draw a distinction between the various classes of offences. In the case where a man goes into a restaurant and orders a meal, and, after consuming it, says that he has no means of paying for it, it was usual to convict for obtaining food by false pretences. But in \"R v Jones\" , an English court found that it is neither larceny nor false pretences, but an offence under the Debtors Act 1869, of obtaining credit by fraud.\n\n\"R v Danger\" revealed a lacuna in the law. This was remedied by section 90 of the Larceny Act 1861. That section was replaced by section 32(2) of the Larceny Act 1916.\n\nSection 32 of the Larceny Act 1916 read:\n\nThe offence of obtaining by false pretences, contrary to section 32(1) of the Larceny Act 1916, was replaced by the offence of obtaining property by deception, contrary to section 15 of the Theft Act 1968. Section 32(2) of the Larceny Act 1916 was replaced by section 20(2) of the Theft Act 1968.\n"}
{"id": "13105847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13105847", "title": "George Enescu Festival", "text": "George Enescu Festival\n\nThe George Enescu Festival (also known as George Enescu International Festival and Competition), held in honor of the celebrated Romanian composer George Enescu, is the biggest classical music festival and classical international competition held in Romania and one of the biggest in Eastern Europe. Enescu's close associate George Georgescu organized the first festival in 1958; highlights included a performance of Bach's Concerto for Two Violins with Yehudi Menuhin and David Oistrakh as soloists and a staging of Enescu's sole opera, \"Œdipe\", with Constantin Silvestri conducting. \n\nThe official opening day of the Enescu Festival took place on 4 September 1958, merely three years after George Enescu's death. Among the music world's personalities that were present for this first edition of the festival were performers such as David Oistrah, Halina Czerny-Stefanka, Nadia Boulanger, Monique Haas, Iacov Zak and Claudio Arrau, and conductors such as Sir John Barbirolli, Carlo Felice Cillario and Carlo Zecchi. On 22 September of the same year, the national premiere of George Enescu's lyrical tragedy \"Oedipe\" took place, starring a young David Ohanesian in the lead role. This role was going to mark out the rest of his career as a soloist (conductor: Constantin Silvestri, Directed by: Jean Ranzescu, Scenery: Roland Laub).\n\nViolinist, teacher, conductor and composer, worldwide known for his lush opera composition \"Oedipe\", George Enescu presented his first work as a composer with the Collonne Orchestra in Paris, 1898; he also performed as a conductor at prestigious Carnegie Hall (NY). George Enescu was also the teacher of one of the greatest violinists of the past century – Lord Yehudi Menuhin. Their bond was so strong that in 1995, Menuhin accepted the invitation to come to Romania to open the George Enescu International Festival. Menuhin also accepted to be the President of Honor of the Enescu Festival in 1998, though his schedule as a soloist was full up to 2003. \n\nToday, an average of around 20 works by Romanian composer George Enescu are interpreted in the Enescu Festival each edition. The 2015 edition of the Enescu Festival (30 August – 20 September 2015 Bucharest) brings on stage interpretations from Enescu's works by record-breaking German violinist David Garrett, San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (Pulitzer Prize for Music), or Israel Philharmonic Orchestra under Zubin Mehta. Highlights of this edition of the Festival also include violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter, Berliner Philharmoniker, London Symphony Orchestra and Royal Liverpool Symphony Orchestra. \n\nThe concerts are held in three different venues in Bucharest, Iaşi and Sibiu. The 2007 presentations ended with a performance of Carl Orff's \"Carmina Burana\" before an audience of over 4,000 at the Sala Palatului.\n\nThe competition portion of the Festival lasts about a week, and it consists of three different categories: composition (118 participants in 2007), piano (44 in 2007), and violin (41 in 2007), each a record number of participants.\n\nIn the 2005 and 2007 presentations a daily open-air concert was added to the festival program. It is known as the \"Festival Piazza\" and features 3½ hours of classical music, in addition to movies about the life of George Enescu.\n\nThe official opening day of the festival took place on 4 September 1958, merely three years after George Enescu's death, thus marking the official debut of the most important international musical manifestation hosted by Romania. The festival was meant to occur once every three years, being accompanied by an international competition, that was interrupted after the 5th edition, only to be reintroduced in the festival in 1991.\n\nAmong the music world's personalities that were present for this first edition of the show were performers such as Yehudi Menuhin, David Oistrah, Halina Czerny-Stefanka, Nadia Boulanger, Monique Haas, Iacov Zak and Claudio Arrau, and conductors such as Sir John Barbirolli, Carlo Felice Cillario and Carlo Zecchi.\n\nOn 22 September of the same year, the national premiere of George Enescu's lyrical tragedy \"Oedipe\" took place, starring a young David Ohanesian in the lead role. This role was going to mark out the rest of his career as a soloist (conductor: Constantin Silvestri, Directed by: Jean Ranzescu, Scenery: Roland Laub).\n\nCompared to the first one, the second edition paid much more attention to repertoires from the lyrical theatre and vocal art. This initiative was supported by several renowned soloists such as Dimitr Uzunov, Ivan Petrov and Anton Dermota. Five lyrical spectacles were presented by the Bucharest Theatre of Opera and Ballet: « Oedipe » by George Enescu, «Boris Godunov » by Modest Mussorgski, « Fidelio » by Ludwig van Beethoven, « Othello » by Giuseppe Verdi and « O Noapte Furtunoasă » by Paul Constantinescu, alongside two ballet acts in the forms of « La Piata » by Mihai Jora and « Priculiciul » by Zeno Vancea.\n\nFor the first time, there were opened three new concert halls: the Grand Hall of the Palace, the Small Hall of the Palace (now the Auditorium Hall) and the Concert Studio of the Romanian Radiotelevision (now the Mihail Jora Concert Studio).\n\nIn this edition participated the following: Sviatoslav Richter, Aldo Ciccolini, Leonid Kogan, Henryk Szeryng, Valentin Gheorghiu, Ştefan Gheorghiu, Vladimir Orlov, Radu Aldulescu, Ion Voicu, Sir John Barbirolli (his second time at the George Enescu Festival), Lorin Maazel, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski with George Georgescu, Mircea Cristescu, Mircea Basarab, Iosif Conta and Mihai Brediceanu.\n\nThe third edition debuted with a regrettable event – the death of the conductor George Georgescu, a few days after the beginning of the international event, depriving the Romanian stage of an indisputable artist.\n\nThe success of the previous editions was reconfirmed in 1964 mainly by the presence of exceptional international artists such as: Arthur Rubinstein, Henryk Szering, Gaspar Cassado, Monique Haas, Miroslav Ceangalovici, André Navarra, André Cluytens, Herbert von Karajan, Zubin Mehta and John Pritchard. Beside them there were also Romanian artists such as Valentin and Ştefan Gheorghiu, Ştefan Ruha, Ion Voicu, Radu Aldulescu, Vladimir Orlov, Mircea Basarab and Mihai Brediceanu.\n\nIt was an edition of first auditions, among the most important being the interpretations of the poem Vox Maris (by the Radiotelevision Orchestra, conducted by Iosif Conta) and the Piano Quartet no. 1, both signed by George Enescu.\n\nDuring the 1967 festival, a great importance was given again to promoting both Enescian music and Romanian contemporary creations. It was one of the editions when the highest number of George Enescu's musical pieces was auditioned (12) and when 18 Romanian composers were included in the concert programs.\n\nThis edition also brought the first world audition of the Enescian creation: \"Trio in A minor for violin, cello and piano\". Other important first auditions were: \"String Quartet No. 2\" by Mihail Jora, \"String Quartet No. 7\" by Wilhelm Berger and \"Scene nocturne\" by Anatol Vieru.\n\nBesides the presence of Romanian orchestras and artists (Valentin Gheorghiu, Ion Voicu, Radu Aldulescu, Mircea Basarab, Constantin Bugeanu and Antonin Ciolan, the \"George Enescu\" Philharmonic Orchestra, the Radiotelevision Orchestra, the Philharmonic Orchestra in Cluj, the Madrigal Choir, the \"George Enescu\" Quintet or the \"Muzica Quartet\"), international performers or ensembles were also present, such as Los Angeles Philharmonic, Moscow State Philharmonic, Grand Paris Opera Ballet, Czech Nonet and Tatrai Quartet. These ones and other artists such as Van Cliburn, Isaac Stern, Claire Bernard, Friedrich Gulda, David Oistrah, Mstislav Rostropovich, Zubin Mehta, Kiril Kondrashin and Kurt Masur have filled the concert halls once again.\n\nDue to the Beethoven bicentenary, an initial characteristic of this edition was the massive presence of the creation of Bonn titan – 12 works interpreted – during the festival.\n\nAccording to this and considering Enescu's affinity for the great classic, the Research Sector of the History of Art Institute, part of the Academy of Social and Political Sciences and the \"George Enescu\" Studies Center organized a round table with the theme \"George Enescu and the Beethovian tradition\".\n\nThe international personalities who performed in 1970 on the Bucharest stages were Paul Badura- Skoda, Gyorgy Cziffra, Henryk Szeryng, Mstislav Rostropovich, Nicanor Zabaletta, Jean Pierre Rampal, who replaced Valentin Gheorghiu (who became unavailable in the last minute), Virginia Zeani, Paul Klecky and André Previn. If in the previous editions the range of instruments was reduced to piano, violin and cello, during this edition a greater variety was observed, by inviting the most notable harpist of the time, Nicanor Zabaletta, and the legendary flautist Jean Pierre Rampal.\n\nProbably the most important symphonic ensemble was the London Symphony Orchestra for which the Palace Grand Hall proved to be too small. Besides these two, other orchestras were also present such as the Opera and Ballet Theatre Orchestra in Leningrad, the Bach Gewandhaus Orchestra in Leipzig and other chamber orchestras, such as the Juilliard American Quintet and the Gasparo da Salo Chamber Orchestra.\n\nThe sixth edition of the International Festival \"George Enescu\" was reduced to only one week, due to the discomfort presented by the political authorities, who considered an artistic manifestation of this kind to be a useless investment.\n\nAmong the international soloists and conductors present this year were: Leonid Kogan, who replaced Sviatoslav Richter, who was supposed to perform in the opening concert, Yehudi Menuhin, Philippe Entremont, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski and Radmila Bakocevici.\n\nArtists were invited exclusively on political criteria, most of them coming from socialist countries or from the ones sympathizing with the doctrine of the communist government. Three from the five international orchestras come from the communist countries.\n\nThis year, the Festival did not include a competition and an organizing committee. Also, the International Musicology Symposium did not benefit from the participation of international researchers, becoming a national symposium.\n\nThe soloists and the orchestras invited to participate in the festival were again selected based on political criteria. Among the notable international personalities, the Romanian public could attend the concerts of Pierre Cochereau, Christian Ferras, Grace Bumbry, Victoria de Los Angeles and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, three years before the retirement of the great artist.\n\nThere were four international ensembles present: the Hungarian Symphony Radiotelevision Orchestra in Budapest, the Madrigals in Belgrad, Moscow Chamber Orchestra and the \"Studio der Frühen Musik\" Vocal-Instrumental Quartet.\n\nAmong the Romanian artists could be mention: Radu Lupu, Ştefan Ruha, Ludovic Bacs, Mircea Basarab, Mihai Brediceanu, Iosif Conta, Emil Simion and Cornel Trăilescu.\n\nThe Festival « George Enescu » was becoming rather a national manifestation, as a shadow of the Competition \"Cântarea României\", which could thus celebrate its laureates at an international artistic level. Despite this drawback, this year's edition had a few remarkable guests, such as Nikita Magaloff, Viktor Tretiakov, Ludwig Hölscher and Sheila Armstrong.\n\nThe international instrumental ensembles that came to Bucharest had a chamber music repertoire (Deutsche Kammerakademie, the Sextet Gabrielli Brass Ensemble and the Contemporary Music Atelier in Poland). A novelty was the presence of two choreographical ensembles: Alvin Ailey Ballet Company from the US and Miyagi Minoru Traditional Dance Troupe from Japan.\n\nAlthough the organizers did not dispose of great funds, they made efforts to start this edition, with the occasion of the 100 years anniversary from the birth of George Enescu.\n\nSome of the international personalities present were: Annerose Schmidt, François Joël Thiollier, Vladimir Spivakov, Emil Ceakarov, Isaac Karabtchiewisky and Herbert Kegel.\n\nThree of the seven musical troupes present in the festival were choreographical ensembles: Eurythmeum Troupe from Stuttgart, Lar Lubovitch Company and Sopianae Ballet Company.\n\nThe critics had very good reviews for the Great Academic Theatre Ensemble of URSS which performed \"The Queen of Spades\" and \"Iolanta\" by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky and \"Mozart and Salieri\" by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, along with other famous pieces of the Russian, Italian and French romantic lyrical repertoire.\n\nFrom the Romanian personalities present at the festival we mention: Valentin Gheorghiu, Dan Grigore, Radu Lupu, Ion Voicu and many names of the lyrical stage such as: Victoria Mann, Emilia Petrescu, Mihaela Agachi, Ionel Pantea, Florin Diaconescu.\n\nAn unprecedented number of Romanian creations was registered at the 10th edition, being interpreted 80 contemporary works, an impressive number, considering that in the program were included only 76 Romanian composers.\n\nThe Enescian creation was also generously represented, 25 works were interpreted, the highest number registered until then. Highly appreciated interpretations of the Enescian works were performed, among others, by Cristian Mandeal (\"Third Suite\") and Ion Baciu (\"Second Symphony\").\n\nInternationally reputed interprets performing in the Festival were: Viktor Tretiakov, Siegfried Lorenz, Herbert Kaliga, Rudolf Innig, Jose Miguel Moreno Aguado and Jean Perisson. There were only two international instrumental ensembles in this edition, due to limited funds, the Dolezal Quartet from Czechoslovakia and Brodsky Quartet from Great Britain.\n\nThe 1988 edition took place during the Romanian Antheneum Centenary. Also, 120 years from the foundation of the \"George Enescu\" Philharmonic was celebrated that year.\n\nFrom the peak of the interpretative moments of George Enescu's creation we mention: \"Symphony I\" conductor Mihai Brediceanu, \"Vox Maris\" symphonic poem conducted by Iosif Conta, \"Rapsody I\" conducted by Yekoslav Sutej and \"Two Intermezzi for String Orchestra\" – Târgu-Mureș Chamber Orchestra.\n\nThe international personalities who participated in this edition were Georges Pludermacher, Michael Roll, Levon Ambartumian and Ferdinang Klinda.\n\nDuring the festival, original moments were offered by Alexander Rudin, present both as a pianist and a cellist, in two concerts by J. Haydn and the French conductor Francoise Legrande.\n\nStarting with this edition, the first after the events of December 1989, the International Festival \"George Enescu\" begins to recapture its former glory.\n\nThe combined efforts of the organizing institutions succeeded to bring to Bucharest international renowned guests. It was a new beginning, which resulted, in the coming editions, in an array of famous international music names.\n\nFrom the guest artists we mention: Mathias Weber, Jean Francois Antionioli, Gerhard Oppitz, Teiko MaMaehashi, Carlos Paita, Levon Ambartumian and Michiyoshi Inoue.\n\nYolanda Marculescu, who had been the prima dona of the Romanian National Opera of Bucharest from 1948 to 1968, was invited to return to Romania as a juror in 1991.\n\nThe Theatre of Classical Ballet from Kiev, the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, the Percussionists from Hague, the Saint Martin in the Fields Chamber Orchestra, Rheinisches Barocktrio, and Concerto Averna from Warsaw were the international ensembles present in the festival.A distinctive feature of this festival was the presence of works such as \"Missa Brevis\" by Joseph Haydn, \"Requiem\" by Mozart, \"Palestrina Missa Brevis\" operas impossible to interpret in the communist era.\n\nThe allocated funds, the facilities and the authorities’ desire to create a new international image of Romania in the 90's, led to organizing the 13th edition at incredible high standards. Thus, through the Government's Decision nr. 364/30 from 1995, the amount of 2.690.488 RON (approx. $2 million) was approved for organizing the festival, to which the financial support of the Romanian Radiotelevision Society was added.\n\nImportant international names participated in this edition, such as: Lord Yehudi Menuhin, Lorin Maazel, Georges Pretre, Zubin Mehta, Yuri Temirkanov, Roberto Benzi, Sergiu Comissiona, Alberto Lissy, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski, Jean Pierre Rampal, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London, the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Saint Petersburg Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, the Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Radio Television Orchestra in Madrid, along with the most important Romanian soloists and instrumental and vocal ensembles.\n\nOne of the most controversial moments of this edition was the putting in stage of George Enescu's opera \"Oedipe\" by Andrei Şerban. In this version, the key role was interpreted by two soloists: Sever Barnea – young Oedipe and Nicolae Urdareanu – old Oedipe. Andrei Şerban gave the spectacle strong political connotations, which led to inevitable reactions.\n\nIn 1998, the anniversary of 40 years from the first International Festival « George Enescu » was celebrated. Complementary activities took place in the same time with the international event: recitals and concerts performed during the series \"Romanian Music of the 20th century\" (with the support of the National Radio Orchestra and the ensembles Archaeus, Concordia, Contraste, Romantica, Trio Modus), series entitled \"Bach by Midnight\", the International Seminar \"George Enescu and the music of the 20th century\" and the International Seminar I.A.M.A. with the theme \"Development Directions of Managerial Cultural Exchanges\".\n\nTwelve international music troupes participated in this year's edition: the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra from Chicago, the Tonhalle Zurich Orchestra, the French National Orchestra, the Symphony Orchestra from Koln, the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra, The Budapest Festival Orchestra, the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, the Moscow Virtuosi Orchestra, The Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia Orchestra from Rome, the Kremarata Baltika Chamber Orchestra and the Alban Berg Quartet.\n\nFrom the interprets and soloists present we mention: Viktoria Mullova, Gidon Kremer, Misha Maisky, Peter Donhoe, Peter Zimmermann, Shlomo Minz, Barbara Hendricks, Vladimir Spivakov, Yan Pascal Tortellier, Lawrence Foster, Daniel Barenboim, Lord Yehudi Menuhin, for the last time in front of the Romanian public, the maestro passed the following year.\n\nThe 2001 edition was by far the richest and most glamorous of all 15 editions of the festival. A lot of prestigious international artists performed on the Bucharest stages during the three-week festival. Among the participants of the 15th edition were: Helene Grimaud, Vasko Vasiliev, Jean-Phillippe Collard, Rudolf Buchbinder, Maurice Andre, Maxim Vengerov, Pierre Amoyal, Isabelle Faust, Christian Zacharias, Cristoph Eschenbach, Laurent Petitgrard, Kurt Masur, Claus Peter Flor, Alexandros Myrat, Michel Plasson, Seiji Ozawa, Ghenadi Rojdestvenski, Leopold Hager, Sakari Oramo and Riccardo Mutti.\n\nBeside these world-renowned personalities were prestigious instrumental ensembles such as: the Paris Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Russian State Symphony Chapel, the Hamburg Radio Orchestra, Orchestre National du Capitole de Toulouse, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, Penderecki Festival Orchestra, Orchestre de Chambre de Lausanne, London Chamber Orchestra, „Sine Nomine\" Quartet.\n\nThe \"By Midnight\" concert series continued in this edition starting with Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, 17 operas were interpreted.\n\nThe organizers concentrated on promoting the contemporary Romanian creations, through the series entitled \"Romanian Music of the 20th Century\", during which important operas could be listened to, signed mostly by the most appreciated and prestigious Romanian composers.\n\nThe International Contest « George Enescu » was organized a week before the Festival, allowing the finale and the Gala Concert to be included in the festival program. Similar to the precedent edition, the series \"Midnight Concerts\" continued, this year's focus being on Ludwig van Beethoven (\"Beethoven by Midnight\"), 26 of his works being interpreted.\n\nIn 2003, there was an initiative to organize concerts in the Festival Market, idea which continued in the following editions. Therefore, the International Festival \"George Enescu\" symbolically greeted potential audiences, facilitating the access to classical music to those unfamiliar with the genre.\n\nThe artistic excellence of the participants was confirmed also during this edition, when 11 international symphony orchestras performed, with Sir Collin Davis as conductor, the Orchestra of the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino (conducted by Zubin Mehta, a familiar presence in the program of the International Festival \"George Enescu\"), the Nazionale di Santa Cecilia Orchestra from Rome (with Myung Whun Chung as conductor), the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra (conducted by Leif Segerstam), the Royal Stockholm Orchestra (conducted by Alain Gilbert) or the Vienna Symphony Orchestra (conducted by Vladimir Fedoseev). The public could also see perform the Gulbenkian Orchestra from Lisbon or the Britten Sinfonia Ensemble from Great Britain.\n\nThe 2005 edition was organized for the commemoration of 50 years from the passing of the great composer. The objectives were to present and promote the Enescian creation to the prestigious artists invited, to promote the contemporary Romanian creations, to include the precedent editions laureates in the festival program and to open the festival to a jazz repertoire.\n\nAs a premier, for this edition there were presented three important elements: Johann Sebastian Bach's Brandenburg concertos and orchestral suites, performed by King's Consort ensemble and Ludwig van Beethoven's concertos for piano, with Christian Zacharias as soloist. Besides King's Consort ensemble and Christian Zacharias, in this edition also participated: Kirov Theatre Symphony Orchestra with conductor Valery Gergiev, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Zubin Mehta, and Nigel Kennedy.\n\nThis edition's pleasant surprises were offered by the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Jukka-Pekka Saraste, Murray Perahia, Martha Argerich, Trio Beaux Arts and the violinist Joshua Bell who replaced Maxim Vegherov (unavailable). The absence of the masterpiece \"Oedipe\" on the festival banners was criticized.\n\nSimilar to the precedent edition, the variety of the repertoire can be noticed, great symphony hits or concerts were accompanied by other names, some of them quasi-famous to the large audience, coming from either the areas of old music, or from the most innovative areas of the contemporary music. This change is due to the type of ensembles invited, some of them being specialized in interpreting historical repertoires and others in contemporary ones.\n\nGeorge Enescu's compositions were also present in this year's program.\n\nThe debut at the end of August was a premiere for this edition, which had seven musical themed directions (« Romanian Contemporary Creation », « Enescu and His Contemporaries », « Midnight Concerts », « Classical Themes in Modern Interpretation », « Opera and Ballet », « Great Orchestras » and « Chamber Concerts ») and a long and consistent program. The complexity of the repertoire, a feature of the previous festival editions, reached its peak this year.\n\nThe fact that in 2007, \"Oedipe\" opera was not included on the festival banners led to criticism, therefore, this year's edition debuted with this spectacle, a co-production of the Capitole Theatre in Toulouse and the Romanian Opera in Bucharest.\n\nThe commemoration of 200 years from the passing of Joseph Haydn in 2009, concluded in Haydn being the second composer in the top of works included in the festival program.\n\nThe Lausanne Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Christian Zacharias performed the music of the great Austrian maestro for three evenings, and was joined by the Ensemble le Musiciens du Loubre, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and the Munich Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra.\n\nThe novelty of this edition was the concert series \"Classical Themes in Modern Interpretation\" as an alternative for jazz and world music lovers. From this series concert we mention Uri Caine and his troupe, Florin Răducanu.\n\nThe 20th edition of the George Enescu International Festival and Competition presented and promoted the Enescu's works, the artistic and interpretative values of contemporary Romanian music, provided prestigious platform for launching value interpreters from among the younger generation and promoted the winners of previous editions.\n\nAmong participating groups: Wiener Philharmoniker / Franz Welser Möst, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra / Zubin Mehta, Yefim Bronfman, Vadim Repin, Staatskapelle Berlin / Daniel Barenboim Orchestra Accademia Nazionale di \"Santa Cecilia\" of Rome / Antonio Pappano, Orchestre National de France / Daniele Gatti, London Symphony Orchestra, Mariinsky Orchestra / Valery Gergiev, Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, Resident Orkestr / Christian Badea, Hungarian National Philharmonic / Zoltan Kocsis, Boris Berezovsky, Gulbenkian Symphony Orchestra / Lawrence Foster, Saint Martin in the Fields / Murray Perahia, Yundi, Isabelle Faust, Christian Zacharias, Sisters Labeque, Gidon Kremer, Helene Grimaud, David Garrett etc. with artists and bands from Romania: Dan Grigore, Horia Andreescu, Cristian Mandeal, Dana Borşan, Luiza Borac Voces Quartet, Alexandru Tomescu, Philharmonic \"George Enescu\" National Radra.\n\nThe joint concerts in the series entitled \"Enescu and his contemporaries\" continued, including chamber works in the interpretation of young soloists. Internationally renowned ensembles performed as \"Great international orchestras\" and \"Chamber concerts\", along with opera and ballet performances.\n\nA series dedicated to contemporary music - \"Music of the 21st century\" - brought together works by Romanian and foreign contemporary composers. The works were presented by bands and singers in Romania and abroad. The series was accompanied by a \"workshop\" attended by 17 young composers, master and doctoral university attendees from the country. \n\nA new entry in the Festival's program was the series \"World Music\", related to one of the essential contributions made by Enescu's Universal Music: use of specific national musical elements through symphony processing. This series was attended by composers and ensembles that brought elements from the Indian, Japanese, Argentinean, Yiddish, Lebanese, Moroccan and Romanian music.\n\nThere were 8 theaters and concert halls (Hall of the Palace, Romanian Athenaeum, Bucharest National Opera, National Theatre \"I. L Caragiale\" National Art Museum Hall, \"Mihail Jora\" Hall at the Romanian Radio Society, Small Hall of the Romanian Athenaeum, National University of Music Bucharest) and an outside stage in The Festival's Square. \nThere were over 160 artistic events including 8 Romanian music concerts, 13 chamber concerts, 20 \"Great International Orchestras\"concerts, 6 concerts in the series \"Enescu and his contemporaries\", 10 concerts in the \"World Music\" series, 5 opera events, 5 ballets shows, 37 concerts as a part of the international competition, 64 events in Festival Square, 8 conferences in the musicology Symposium.\n\nOther 23 concerts were held in the rest of the country, in Arad, Busteni, Cluj Napoca, Craiova, Iasi, Sibiu, Târgu Mureş and Timişoara. \nThe festival also hosted an art exhibition named \"E-Biennial\", in collaboration with the National Museum of Art, Museum of the Romanian Peasant, Ann Art and the Bucharest University of Arts.\n\nThe XXI edition of the \"George Enescu\" International Festival, held between 1 and 28 September 2013 brought together in Bucharest famous artists and orchestras like Concertgebouw Amsterdam, Staatskapelle Berlin, London Philharmonic, Münchener Philharmoniker, Royal Philharmonic London, Royal Stockholm Philharmonic and Academy Saint Martin in the Fields.\n\nSome of the most important personalities of the international classical music were present on the Festival scene: the conductors Daniel Barenboim and Mariss Jansons, the pianists Radu Lupu, Murray Perahia, Pinchas Zuckerman, Maxim Vengerov and Evgeny Kissin. \n\nFor the XXI edition of the Festival there are artists and groups who came for the first time in Romania: Rundfunk Sinfonieorchester Berlin (the orchestra interpreted Wagner's tetralogy for the first time at Bucharest, in the last 50 years), Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, National Philharmonic Of Russia, Harmonius Chamber Orchestra – Osaka, Camerata Salzburg, Vortice Dance Company and the famous actor John Malkovich, the narrator of The Infernal Comedy - Confessions of a Serial Killer, interpreted by Wiener Akademie. As a reconfirmation of Festival's value, famous orchestras like Royal Concertgebouw Amsterdam and Staatskapelle Berlin, Academia Santa Cecilia di Roma returned in Romania in 2013. \n\nAnother premiere of the XXI edition was the Bucharest transformation into a magical space, in a capital of creativity.

In early December 2016, a prominent climate change sceptic, Scott Pruitt was selected as a new administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These proceeding had raised concerns among academic community that the scientific opinion on climate change might be suppressed during Trump's presidency. Indeed, according to Reuters sources, in 25 January 2017, Trump's administration instructed United States Environmental Protection Agency to remove climate change page from their website.\n\nFearing for possible deletion, or alteration of the US government websites containing the government climate data, as happened in Canada, people from various academic backgrounds and training such as coders, environmental scientists, social scientists, archivists, and librarians gathered together in order to save US government websites at risk of changing or disappearing during or after government transition.

When it capsizes near shore, it is everyone for themselves. The book then chronicles the lives of four of the passengers, Murad, Halima, Aziz and Faten, exploring their lives before the trip and what motivated their attempt at immigration.\n\nThe novel sets up an empathy for the situations which create the need for migration; as critic Lisa Marchi points out, the novel \"highlights the economic precarity, social invisibility, and indisputable vulnerability of the migrants\".\n\nThe novel also complicates the nature of the \"Muslim\" identity of many of these immigrants.\n\nWhen describing the novel, critic Lisa Marchi said it's \"wisely constructed: the writer confidently travels between temporal settings and geographical zones to gradually unveil the genealogy of each character’s migratory project\".\n"}

It was built between 1926 and 1929 by Matilda Dodge Wilson (the widow of auto pioneer John Francis Dodge) and her second husband, lumber broker Alfred G. Wilson. In 1957, the mansion and the surrounding property and buildings were donated to the State of Michigan in order to fund Michigan State University–Oakland, now known as Oakland University. In 2012, it was named a National Historic Landmark.\n\nMeadow Brook Farms originally belonged to Matilda's first husband, automotive tycoon John F. Dodge. He purchased the property along with the large white farmhouse off of Adams Road as a holiday retreat for his family. The mansion is located on a estate off South Adams Road; Dodge added a nine-hole golf course, some of the holes of which still follow the current Katke-Cousins 18-hole course on the property. Meadow Brook Hall was constructed between 1926 and 1929 by Matilda Dodge Wilson and her second husband, Alfred Wilson at a cost of $4 million. Throughout her lifetime, Matilda resided in the hall for over forty years. Some of the family's time was spent vacationing at their summer home in Bar Harbor, Maine and winter home in Scottsdale, Arizona. The hall was also partially closed for a brief time during the depth of the Depression.\n\nCovering and with 110 rooms, the mansion is the fourth largest historic house museum in the United States. It was designed by William Kapp of the firm Smith, Hinchman & Grylls in a Tudor-revival style. The building features stonework and a plaster dining room ceiling created by Corrado Parducci. Much of the original artwork collected by the Wilsons is still found at Meadow Brook including paintings by Anthony van Dyck, Rosa Bonheur, Joshua Reynolds, John Constable and Thomas Gainsborough, as well as Tiffany glass, Stickley furniture, Meissen porcelain, and Rookwood pottery. The estate was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and National Historic Landmark in 2012.\n\nIn 1957, Alfred and Matilda Dodge Wilson donated the 1,500 acre estate to Michigan State University, along with $2 million to create a branch college campus, now known as Oakland University. The Wilsons lived in the on the property until Alfred's death in 1962. Mrs. Wilson lived in Meadow Brook Hall until her death in 1967.\n\nThe Meadow Brook Concours d'Elegance was held annually during August on the grounds of Meadow Brook Hall from 1979 until 2010. This week-long event was one of the largest collector car shows in the world, and a social event in the tradition of the first Concours in 1920s Paris which was an exhibition of automotive design, craftsmanship, history and a tool for automobile manufacturers to market products. Over the years, the event also served as a fundraiser for the preservation of Meadow Brook Hall.\n\nOn July 20, 2010, promoters announced that the Concours d'Elegance would leave Meadow Brook Hall after that year for the Inn at St. John's in Plymouth, Michigan. The event is now known at the Concours d'Elegance of America at St. John's.\n\n\n\n"}

Thirty-five German intelligence specialists were transferred along with various equipment first to Sweden and then to U.S. camps in occupied Germany through an agreement between the Americans and the German High Command of the Wehrmacht in Norway.\n\nThe intelligence material from Operation Claw, among it a Soviet codebook, became very useful for the Americans during the Cold War. Operation Claw was controversial both when it happened and afterwards. In 1945, it was controversial that the Americans operated in what was seen as a British controlled country, and that they secured information about its ally the Soviet Union, in cooperation with neutral Sweden. In later years, a hypothesis that the Norwegian resistance fighter Kai Holst's sudden death in June 1945 was related to his involvement in the Operation Claw has been put forward by among others the historian Tore Pryser.\n\nEven before the war in Europe ended the various allied states had begun the search for German scientists and other German expertise. Signals intelligence had been vital during World War II and especially the British work with breaking the German codes, from the Enigma had been of huge importance. The Yalta Conference in February 1945 had revealed conflicts of interest between the western allied nations on one side and the Soviet Union and the relation was severely strained.\n\nAmerican intelligence organisations were very interested in German intelligence experts knowledge of the Soviet Union and immediately after the war in Europe ended they began to cooperate with the German Major General Reinhard Gehlen and his organisation Fremde Heere Ost (FHO) which had led German intelligence on the Eastern Front. It was part of an organized effort to obtain as much German intelligence information and personnel as possible; the operation had the name Target Intelligence Committee (TICOM).\n\nThe war was however still fought in East-Asia, the US and the Soviet Union were still allies and the Americans were counting on Soviet assistance in the war against Japan. The allies had designated Norway as part of the British sphere of influence. Both for the US and the neutral Sweden the operation was thus very sensitive and was conducted in great secrecy.\n\nIn the Wehrmacht camp at Lillehammer a group of 35 German experts on signals intelligence were gathered. They had been working on the Eastern Front against Soviet forces and had an archive and extensive knowledge about Soviet affairs. This was knowledge the Western Allies, and especially the Americans, wanted and that probably also were of use during the Cold War.\n\nIn cooperation with the American intelligence organisation Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and with knowledge and support from the Norwegian legation in Stockholm agents for the Swedish intelligence organisation C-byrån traveled together with two Norwegian intelligence specialists to Lillehammer on May 9 and 10, 1945. The German group of experts were taken out of the camp and transported to Sweden. After a few weeks in Sweden they were on June 12 flown from Torslanda Airport close to Gothenburg to US occupied Germany and were interned in an American military camp at Wiesbaden.\n\nThe transfer to Sweden of the German experts at Lillehammer, that OSS called \"Operation Claw\", was directed from the highest level. From the U.S. side the leader of OSS, Major General William J. Donovan was involved, from the Swedish side the chief of the Defense Staff, Major General Carl August Ehrensvärd. The famous Swedish police director Harry Söderman was also involved from the Swedish side.\n\nMore than a month after the German capitulation, a British led search supported by Norwegian personnel was executed in order to find people from Gestapo and other German key personnel that tried to hide among ordinary soldiers in German military camps. The search force that Kai Holst and other Norwegians were assisting were soon aware of that a number of German key personnel had been removed in the Swedish-US operation a month earlier.\n\nKai Holst had been working at the military office number 4 (Mi4) at the Norwegian legation in Stockholm, and after the search he unexpectedly traveled right back to Stockholm. The next day he was found shot at the top of the staircase in an apartment building at Rindögatan 42 on Gärdet. The official cause of death was stated as suicide, but neither Holst's family nor many of his colleagues from the resistance movement have accepted this and are of the opinion that he was liquidated. The historian Tore Pryser has put forward the hypothesis that Holst brought with him information from Lillehammer that could damage Operation Claw and thus was killed. To be able to damage the operation Kai Holst can not have been trusted as others were. He must have been considered a threat due to his contact with Alexandra Kollontaj who was ambassador in Stockholm representing Soviet Union. A possible reason for the what looks like a murder of Kai Holst was not his knowledge as such but his connections.\n\nOperation Claw was the beginning of the postwar era cooperation between Swedish and US intelligence services, in violation of Sweden's officially stated neutrality. From the American side the operation was viewed as a great success and the responsible within OSS, William T. Carlson and Joseph T. Kloman, were both honored with decorations where the operation specifically were mentioned. For the Swedish C-byrån Operation Claw quickly became toxic. Even though the operation was to be kept confidential, information leaked to the Swedish press and C-byrån were dissolved in February 1946.\n\nInformation regarding Operation Claw continued to be classified as confidential in the post-war years and some of it still remains so today. A report about the operation in the British National Archives is restricted until 2020.\n\n\n\n"}

When Serbia started trying to evade economic and political control by the Habsburgs and build links with other countries, particularly Bulgaria and France, the Hungarian government decided to punish the Serbs with economic sanctions. Specifically, in an attempt to reduce its economic dependence on the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Serbia began to import French rather than Austrian munitions in 1904 and established a customs union with Bulgaria in 1905, ending the sale of tariff-laden Austrian goods in Serbia.\n\nLong used to setting economic policy, Austria responded in April 1906 by closing its borders to Serbian pork. Serbia refused to bow to Vienna, gained French investment to build new packing plants for international trade, began to order materials from Austria's rival Germany\nand pressured the Austrian-administrated provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina for a trade outlet on the Adriatic Sea. That caused Austria to give up by March 1908, as shown by the trade statistics of the period in question, published in the 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica:\n\nRussia supported Serbia's actions, and war between Austria-Hungary and Russia was averted only because of a German ultimatum in 1909 that demanded the end of Russian aid to Serbia.\n\n\n"}

Several allegations of investigators' misconduct have been raised and were almost immediately debunked, including supposed unlawful wire-tapping of Trump Tower during the campaign, unmasking of Trump associates on intelligence intercepts, FISA court alleged abuse against Carter Page detailed in the Nunes memo, the alleged installation of a mole in the Trump campaign, and the FBI being denied to forensically analyze the DNC servers.\n\nMueller's appointment to oversee the investigation immediately garnered widespread support from Democrats and from some Republicans in Congress. Senator Charles Schumer (D–NY) said, \"Former Director Mueller is exactly the right kind of individual for this job. I now have significantly greater confidence that the investigation will follow the facts wherever they lead.\" Senator Dianne Feinstein (D–CA) stated, \"Bob was a fine U.S. attorney, a great FBI director and there's no better person who could be asked to perform this function.\" She added, \"He is respected, he is talented and he has the knowledge and ability to do the right thing.\" Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R–UT) tweeted that \"Mueller is a great selection. Impeccable credentials. Should be widely accepted.\" Much Republican support in Congress was lukewarm: Rep. Peter T. King (R–NY) said \"It's fine. I just don't think there is any need for it.\" Republican former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich tweeted that Mueller is a \"superb choice to be special counsel. His reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity,\" but less than a month later he tweeted \"Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair.\"\n\nFormer United States Attorney Preet Bharara wrote of the team that \"Bob Mueller is recruiting the smartest and most seasoned professionals who have a long track record of independence and excellence\".<ref name=\"Jarrett_Perez_6/10/2017\"></ref> Former special prosecutor Ken Starr, who had investigated Bill Clinton during the Clinton administration, said that the team was \"a great, great team of complete professionals\". Attorney George T. Conway III, husband of Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway, wrote an article defending the constitutionality of the Mueller Investigation.\n\nSome conservatives, including political commentators Laura Ingraham, Ann Coulter, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, stated that Mueller should be dismissed and the investigation closed. Christopher Ruddy, the founder of the right-leaning Newsmax, and a friend of Trump, stated that the president has considered firing Mueller.\n\nOn June 23, 2017, Trump stated that members of Mueller's team were \"all Hillary Clinton supporters, some of them worked for Hillary Clinton.\" PolitiFact rated Trump's claim \"Mostly False\", noting that only three had made campaign contributions to Hillary Clinton and one had defended the Clinton Foundation in court. One member of the team had made contributions to Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz and Republican Senator George Allen.<ref name=\"Tobias_6/26/2017\"></ref> In an interview with \"The New York Times\" published on July 19, 2017, Trump stated that he would have not appointed Sessions as Attorney General had he known that he was going to recuse himself from the investigation. Furthermore, Trump confirmed that he would view it as a violation if Mueller investigated his and his family's finances, unrelated to Russia.\n\nOn June 25, 2017, it was reported that a pro-Trump group had launched an ad called \"Witch Hunt,\" featuring conservative Tomi Lahren, which attacked Mueller and the investigation.<ref name=\"Mascaro_6/25/2017\"></ref>\n\nOn July 21, 2017, the \"Washington Post\" reported that Trump asked his advisors about his power to pardon those under investigation. Trump and his legal team discussed the possibility of Trump pardoning aides, family members, and himself. No president has ever pardoned himself, so there is no case law on whether it would be legal. Trump attorneys also reportedly created a list of Mueller's potential conflicts of interest. Trump lawyer John Dowd said the story was \"nonsense\".\n\nOn August 3, 2017, at a campaign-style rally in West Virginia, Trump continued to deny any Russian involvement in his campaign or win: \"The Russia story is a total fabrication. It's just an excuse for the greatest loss in the history of American politics, that's all it is.\" This occurred on the same day as the announcement that another grand jury had been empaneled.<ref name=\"Nussbaum_8/3/2017\"></ref>\n\nOn August 12, 2017, \"The New York Times\" published an interview of Republican Senator Richard Burr, the Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in which he said he was hopeful that the investigation would be complete by the end of the year.\n\nSean Hannity, a strong supporter of Trump, has been a vocal and persistent critic of the Mueller investigation on his Fox News television show, \"Hannity\", and syndicated radio program, \"The Sean Hannity Show\". He has called the investigation a \"witch hunt\" and described Mueller as \"corrupt, abusively biased and political.\" Hannity has asserted that the investigation arose from an elaborate, corrupt scheme involving Hillary Clinton; the Steele dossier, which he asserts is completely false although parts of it have been reported as verified; former Justice Department officials James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Bruce Ohr, and others; and a wiretap on former Trump aide Carter Page that Hannity asserts was obtained by misrepresentations to the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, characterizing the wiretap as an abuse of power that is \"far bigger than Watergate\" and \"the weaponizing of those powerful tools of intelligence and the shredding of our Fourth Amendment, constitutional rights.\"\n\nJeanine Pirro, a former Westchester County district attorney and currently host of the weekly Fox News program \"Justice with Judge Jeanine\", has been friends with President Trump for decades. On her program, Pirro described Mueller, FBI Director Christopher Wray (a Trump appointee), former FBI Director James Comey and other current/former FBI officials as a \"criminal cabal,\" saying \"There is a cleansing needed in our FBI and Department of Justice—it needs to be cleansed of individuals who should not just be fired, but who need to be taken out in cuffs.\"\n\nTucker Carlson, host of the Fox News program \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\", said on March 2, 2018, \"We've been hearing about Russia non-stop, literally non-stop, for more than a year. Almost no information has come out to justify the obsession, none has come out to justify the claim that there was collusion, and most Americans are no longer interested, if they ever were.\"\n\nThroughout 2017 and 2018, Trump and his allies in Congress and the media have promulgated a series of false narratives to assert that the FBI, Justice Department and Mueller investigation have been engaged in an elaborate, corrupt conspiracy against Trump. Among other things, Trump has characterized the Mueller investigation as a \"rigged Russia witch hunt,\" while prominent Trump supporter Sean Hannity has described it as \"the biggest corruption scandal in American history.\" On May 29, 2018, Trump went so far as to assert that the Mueller investigation intended to meddle in the 2018 midterm elections, an accusation Hannity reinforced on his Fox News show that night, saying Mueller \"wants to derail many pro-Trump Republicans in the midterms.\" In a two-minute monologue that same day, Fox News anchorman Shepard Smith flatly debunked that assertion and a number of other Trump narratives, saying \"you laugh at them because there's almost nothing else you can do.\"\n\nAmid concerns that Trump might attempt to halt the investigation by having Mueller dismissed, some members of Congress have supported a bipartisan bill designed to protect Mueller. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced on April 17, 2018, that such a bill was not necessary and he would not allow it to come to the Senate floor for a vote. Nevertheless, the chairman of the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee Chuck Grassley announced on April 19, 2018, that his committee would vote on the measure the following week. The bill cleared the committee on April 26, with four Republicans joining all ten Democrats in a 14-7 vote, but McConnell repeated he would not bring the bill to the floor for a vote.\n\nTrump reportedly asked White House Counsel Donald McGahn in April 2017 to call acting deputy attorney general Dana Boente—who was supervising the Russia probe at the time, before Mueller's appointment—and get him to persuade Comey to announce that Trump was not personally under investigation. McGahn made the call but failed to convince Boente that Comey should make the statement.\n\nIn June 2017, Trump reportedly tried to fire Mueller, according to several independent accounts published in January 2018. The reports said that Trump told McGahn to fire Mueller; that McGahn refused, saying that to do so would have a catastrophic effect on Trump's presidency; and that Trump then backed off. \"The New York Times\" reported that McGahn said he would resign rather than carry out the order, while CNN said McGahn did not directly threaten to resign, and Fox News said Trump was persuaded not to carry out the action by McGahn and other aides. \"The New York Times\" report said that Trump cited three conflicts of interest on Mueller's part to justify the dismissal: a years-old dispute over fees at Trump National Golf Club; the fact that Mueller had most recently worked for the law firm that previously represented Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and the fact that Mueller had been interviewed to return as FBI Director the day before he was appointed special counsel. According to CNN, another reason Trump wanted to fire Mueller was Trump's perception that Mueller was close friends with Comey, although others have described them as professional acquaintances from having simultaneously worked in the Justice Department during the George W. Bush presidency. In August 2017, Trump said he had never thought about firing Mueller, and by December 2017 he had denied it twice more; in that time period his lawyers and advisers also issued five similar denials. By January 2018, Trump and his surrogates had denied that he had considered firing Mueller a total of eight times. Trump dismissed the January 2018 \"The New York Times\" story as \"fake news\". McGahn was interviewed by Mueller's investigators on November 30, 2017.\n\nAlso in June 2017, Trump reportedly instructed his aides to start a campaign for his administration and his Republican allies to discredit potential witnesses in the investigation, including FBI officials Andrew McCabe, Jim Rybicki, and James Baker. The three men had been identified by Comey as his confidants. The instruction was reported in January 2018 by \"Foreign Policy\". Trump's lead attorney John Dowd disputed the accuracy of the report.\n\nIn early December 2017 Trump sought to fire Mueller, according to an April 2018 report in \"The New York Times\", but stopped after learning the news reports he based his decision on were incorrect.\n\nIn January 2018, CNN reported that Trump was unhappy with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller investigation. Trump reportedly talked about wanting to fire Rosenstein and proposed firing him, before being persuaded otherwise by his advisers.\n\nOn March 17, 2018, Trump appeared to abandon his attorneys' advice to avoid directly criticizing the Mueller investigation, tweeting that the \"Mueller probe should never have been started\" and that it was a \"WITCH HUNT!\" He also claimed that \"there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State.\" The next day, he questioned how \"fair\" it was that \"the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans\". Trump did not note that Mueller himself is a Republican, as is the man who appointed him, Rod Rosenstein—who was appointed by Trump. This was the first time he had criticized Mueller by name, alarming many prominent Republicans, who cautioned Trump not to criticize Mueller or give any appearance that he was contemplating having Mueller dismissed; they warned of dire repercussions if he did. Presidential lawyer Ty Cobb later stated that the president \"is not considering or discussing\" firing Mueller.\n\nIn April 2018, following an FBI raid on the office and home of Trump's private attorney Michael Cohen, Trump for the first time spoke openly about firing Mueller, saying that \"many people\" had advised him to do so and \"We'll see what happens.\" Under Department of Justice regulations, that authority can only be exercised by Rosenstein, the DOJ official in charge of the special counsel investigation, but White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump believes he has the power to do it directly, although he is not currently acting to do so. Trump also said that the \"witch hunt\" that began \"right after I won the nomination\" is \"an attack on our country in a true sense. It's an attack on what we all stand for.\" In May 2018, Trump tweeted that the special counsel probe, led by \"13 Angry Democrats\", was investigating him on \"obstruction for a made up, phony crime\". He declared that there was no obstruction, only him \"fighting back\".\n\nFollowing the May 2018 disclosure that FBI informant Stefan Halper had spoken with Trump campaign aides Carter Page, George Papadopolous and Sam Clovis, Trump advanced a conspiracy theory dubbed as Spygate that the previous administration under Barack Obama paid to plant a spy inside Trump's 2016 presidential campaign to assist his rival, Hillary Clinton, win the 2016 US presidential election. With no actual supporting evidence produced, Trump's allegations were widely described as blatantly false. Trump's allegations prompted the Justice Department and the FBI to provide a classified briefing regarding Halper to several Congressmen, including Republicans Trey Gowdy and Paul Ryan. Gowdy and Ryan concluded that the FBI did not do anything improper, and that Russia, not Trump, was not the target of the FBI.\n\nIn June 2018, Trump claimed that a report by Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz \"totally exonerates\" him and that \"the Mueller investigation has been totally discredited\", despite the report having nothing to do with the special counsel investigation, the Trump campaign or Russia. The report was instead focused on the FBI's 2016 investigation of the Hillary Clinton email controversy.\n\nOn August 1, 2018, President Trump said on Twitter that Attorney General Jeff Sessions \"should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further.\" Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani played down the significance of the comment, telling CNN's Dana Bash that Trump was \"was expressing his opinion on his favorite medium, Twitter, for asserting his First Amendment rights\" and said the tweet was not a presidential order. At a press briefing later that day, Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said \"It's not an order, it's the president's opinion.\"\n\nAccording to a \"Washington Post\" tally, by August 21 Trump had fired or threatened over half of the officials with leadership roles in the investigation. Speaking to Reuters on that date he said,“I can go in, and I could do whatever — I could run it if I want. But I decided to stay out. I’m totally allowed to be involved if I wanted to be. So far, I haven’t chosen to be involved.”\n\nIn an interview with \"The Hill\" published on September 19, 2018, Trump said that the Mueller investigation was “beyond a witch hunt” - it is a “hoax” with “17 angry Democrats” which has committed “fraudulent” acts.\n\nOn December 16, 2017, Kory Langhofer, a lawyer for \"Trump for America\", sent a letter to Congress alleging that Mueller's team had unlawfully acquired, via the GSA, tens of thousands of emails sent and received by thirteen senior members of the Trump transition team. The communications derived from the official governmental presidential transition team domain, \"ptt.gov\". On the following day, GSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt stated that Trump's transition team had been explicitly advised at the time of the transition that all material passing through government equipment would be subject to monitoring and auditing, and would not be held back from law enforcement officers. A spokesman for Mueller's investigation, Peter Carr, also rejected Langhofer's claims, stating that the Trump transition emails were acquired appropriately through the criminal investigation process.\n\nOn March 17, 2018, Trump's personal attorney, John Dowd, urged Rod Rosenstein to follow the \"courageous example\" of Sessions in dismissing Andrew McCabe and \"bring an end\" to the Mueller investigation. Dowd originally told the \"Daily Beast\" that he was speaking on behalf of the president, but later told CNN he was speaking only for himself. A source told CNN that Trump had not authorized the statement, but two sources told \"The New York Times\" that Dowd was speaking at Trump's urging. \n\nDuring the week of March 19, 2018, Trump hired the law firm diGenova & Toensing, headed by Joseph diGenova and his wife and law partner Victoria Toensing. Both are longtime Republican activists, having appeared on Fox News on numerous occasions to criticize Democrats, most notably Bill and Hillary Clinton. In recent weeks diGenova has advanced the narrative that a \"deep state\" conspiracy is attempting to subvert Trump. In January 2018, diGenova said on Fox News, \"There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and, if she didn't win the election, to then frame Donald Trump with a falsely created crime. Make no mistake about it: A group of FBI and DOJ people were trying to frame Donald Trump of a falsely created crime.\" Fox News reported that Toensing had recently represented Trump associates Mark Corallo, Sam Clovis, and Erik Prince, and that Corallo, Clovis, and Trump signed waivers of any potential conflicts of interest. The White House announced later that week that diGenova and Toensing would not be hired as part of the special counsel legal team, but might assist Trump in other legal matters. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow cited conflicts of interest, while two sources told \"The New York Times\" that Trump hadn't established personal rapport with diGenova and Toensing.\n\nSeveral conservative sources sided with Trump to embrace and promote the Spygate conspiracy theory, including the \"Fox & Friends\" talk show and political commentators Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity for Fox News, the website Breitbart, and also radio show host Rush Limbaugh. Meanwhile, Infowars host Alex Jones took credit for coining the \"Spygate\" term. Asked on whether the promotion of the conspiracy Spygate theory is meant to discredit the special counsel investigation, Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani said on May 27 that the investigators \"are giving us the material to do it. Of course, we have to do it in defending the president ... it is for public opinion\" on whether to \"impeach or not impeach\" Trump.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported on July 12, 2018, that the White House had ordered that classified information about informant Stephan Halper be given to all members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, beyond the tight access that had previously been granted to the Gang of Eight. The directors of national intelligence and the FBI both opposed the move. House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, a staunch Trump ally, had requested the expanded access for weeks, while Democrats asserted it was an effort by Republicans to gain information they could use to undermine the Mueller investigation.\n\nIt was reported in early September that Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani said that the White House could and likely would prevent the special counsel investigation from making public certain information in its final report which would be covered by executive privilege. Also according to Giuliani, Trump's personal legal team is already preparing a \"counter-report\" to refute the potential special counsel investigation's report.\n\nOn July 26, 2017, Florida Representative Matt Gaetz introduced a congressional resolution calling for a special counsel investigation into the handling of the Hillary Clinton email controversy by James Comey, undue interference of Attorney General Loretta Lynch in that investigation, and the acquisition of Uranium One by the Russian state corporation Rosatom during Mueller's time as FBI director. Gaetz stated that he did not trust Mueller to lead the investigation because of his alleged involvement in approval of the Uranium One deal and his allegedly close relationship with Comey, a probable person of interest in the proposed investigation. The resolution was referred to two House committees where it has remained as of February 21, 2018.\n\nOn August 24, 2017, Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Florida) added a rider to the proposed fiscal 2018 spending bill package that would block funding from being used \"for the investigation under that order of matters occurring before June 2015\" (the month Trump announced he was running for president) immediately and terminated funding for the special counsel investigation 180 days after passage of the bill. Rep. DeSantis said that the DOJ order of May 17, 2017, \"didn't identify a crime to be investigated and practically invites a fishing expedition.\" House Republican leaders did not allow the amendment to proceed to the floor for a vote.\n\nOn November 3, 2017, Gaetz introduced another resolution demanding Mueller's resignation as special counsel due to conflicts of interest, this resolution was co-sponsored by U.S. Representative from Arizona Andy Biggs and U.S. Representative from Texas Louie Gohmert; Arizona Representative Trent Franks co-sponsored the resolution on November 8, 2017. The resolution was referred to the House Judiciary Committee where it has remained as of February 21, 2018. As a \"sense of the House\" resolution, its approval would not be legally binding upon Mueller.\n\nOn February 2, 2018, the House Intelligence Committee with Trump's authorization released a memo written by committee chair Devin Nunes and staff. The Nunes memo, based on classified information, alleged that the FBI and Department of Justice \"may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources\" in October 2016 in seeking authorization for a wiretap on Carter Page, a former adviser to Trump's campaign. Before the memo's release, Trump told associates that it would discredit the investigation, and after its release, Trump claimed in a tweet that the memo \"totally vindicates\" him. On February 24, 2018, the House Intelligence Committee with Trump's authorization released a redacted version of a memo from Adam Schiff, ranking Democratic member of the committee, as a response to the Nunes memo. The response contended the wiretaps were properly obtained and were warranted because Page had been assessed by intelligence agencies as \"an agent of the Russian government,\" adding that \"Our extensive review of the initial FISA application and three subsequent renewals failed to uncover any evidence of illegal, unethical, or unprofessional behavior by law enforcement and instead revealed that both the FBI and DOJ made extensive showings to justify all four requests.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported on March 28, 2018, that the Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz would investigate accusations of wrongdoing surrounding the surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page, \"amid a stream of attacks in recent months from the White House and Republican lawmakers seeking to undermine the special counsel's investigation.\" The announcement fell short of the demands of several Republican politicians and prominent Trump supporters such as Sean Hannity for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel to investigate. CNN reported on March 29, 2018, that Attorney General Jeff Sessions had appointed John W. Huber, the United States Attorney for the District of Utah, to investigate this and other matters. In a letter to three Republican Congressional committee chairmen, Sessions said he would rely on Huber's findings to decide if a special counsel needed to be appointed. Huber had been investigating the matter for a time, but his involvement had not previously been disclosed. CNN reported that Huber is investigating \"a cluster of Republican-driven accusations against the FBI,\" which includes allegations that the FBI acted inappropriately in two matters involving Hillary Clinton, including her emails and the sale of Uranium One to a Russian-owned company.\n\nA May 2017 \"Politico\"/Morning Consult poll showed that 81% of U.S. voters supported the special prosecutor's investigation. A June 2017 Associated Press–NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll asked U.S. adults whether the special counsel investigation could be fair and impartial: 26% were \"extremely confident\" or \"very confident\"; 36% were \"moderately confident\" and 36% were \"not very confident\" or \"not at all confident.\" The poll indicated that 68% of Americans were at least \"moderately concerned\" about inappropriate connections between the Trump campaign and the Russians.\n\nA poll published in November 2017 by ABC News and \"The Washington Post\" found that 58% of Americans approved of Mueller's handling of his investigation, while 28% disapproved. It also indicated that half of Americans believed that President Trump was not co-operating with the investigation. A Quinnipiac poll published on November 15, 2017, suggested that 60% of Americans believed that Mueller's investigation was proceeding fairly, with 27% believing that it was not. The poll also found that 47% of respondents said that President Trump ought to be impeached if he were to dismiss Mueller.\n\nA December poll by Associated Press–NORC indicated that four out of ten Americans believed that Trump had committed a crime in connection with Russia, with an additional three out of ten beyond that believing that he had acted unethically. It found that 62% of Democrats and 5% of Republicans believe that Trump acted illegally. It found that 68% of Americans believed that Trump was obstructing the investigation. 57% of respondents said that they were \"extremely confident\" or \"moderately confident\" that Mueller's investigation is fair.\n\nIn another December poll from \"The Hill\", 54% of respondents believe Mueller has a conflict of interest due to his relationship with James Comey. The poll also found 36% agreed Trump and his allies are getting harsher treatment from the special counsel than Clinton and her allies did during the FBI investigation into her handling of classified material.\" The same poll found that 60 percent of voters say that \"a comment to the FBI director that he should consider letting Flynn off the hook\" is not enough to constitute obstruction of justice.\n\nA \"USA Today\"/Suffolk University poll released on February 26, 2018, showed that a 58% majority of registered voters say they have a lot or some trust in Mueller's investigation, while a 57% majority say they have little or no trust in Trump's denials. Further, 75% say they take the charges filed by Mueller seriously; most of them say they take them \"very\" seriously. That represents some shift in views over the past year. In a \"USA Today\"/Suffolk Poll in March 2017, 63% called it very or somewhat serious.\n\nA CBS poll released in May 2018 found that a majority of Americans, 53%, believe the investigation is politically motivated, although most agreed it should continue. The poll indicated most Republicans believe that Congress should take steps to end the investigation, while most independents and nearly all Democrats feel the investigation should be allowed to continue.\n"}

{"id": "8051987", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8051987", "title": "San Diego free speech fight", "text": "San Diego free speech fight\n\nThe San Diego free speech fight in San Diego, California, in 1912–1913 was one of the most famous of the \"free speech fights\", class conflicts over the free speech rights of labor unions.\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, growing confrontations between the working class and their employers caused suspicion and animosity both within, and against the workers. Striking workers had taken militant action which culminated in the Haymarket Riot in Chicago; the Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886 was crushed, destroying the Knights of Labor, coincident with the birth of the conservative American Federation of Labor. In the western United States the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) inherited the mantle of militant unionism, challenging capital in strikes from Cripple Creek to Canada. Many communities sought to limit the spread of union philosophy by revoking rights granted by the United States Constitution, particularly the freedom of speech granted by the First Amendment.\n\nIn 1905 the WFM and other unions, together with socialist, and anarchist groups met in Chicago to form the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in what came to be called the \"First Continental Congress of the working class.\" The immediate purpose of the IWW was to unite all working people into one worldwide union, regardless of race, creed, sex, skill, or national origin. The ultimate goal was abolition of the wage system, replacing wage labour with worker cooperatives.\n\nThe \"Wobblies\", as IWW members were called, frequently engaged in creative tactics, including soapboxing. The IWW orators spoke to workers about bosses, corruption, exploitation, and the unfairness of capitalism. Championing such a direct challenge to capital, members of the IWW faced persecution and prejudice in North America, and throughout the world. In many American cities, from Pennsylvania to California, IWW members found their right to public speech interfered with by local ordinance or police harassment. Thus began the free speech fights of the IWW.\n\nFrom approximately 1906, the San Diego General Membership Branch of the IWW focused on various small industries, including cigar making and lumber. In 1910 the IWW attempted to organize Mexican workers of the San Diego Consolidated Gas and Electric Company. A successful strike led to the formation of a public service union, which was disbanded when many of the Mexican workers left to participate in the Mexican Revolution.\n\nOne of the most brutal and significant of the free speech fights occurred in the Stingaree neighborhood of San Diego, home to the city's \"undesirables.\" The San Diego Common Council had passed an ordinance to curb Wobbly soapbox orations, resulting in the San Diego free speech fight in which the IWW clashed with law enforcement and vigilantes who were incited to violence by local newspapers.\n\nThe San Diego free speech fight began on February 1, 1912, but confrontation with the San Diego's \"old guard\" began as early as 1910. On November 10, 1910, Local 13 of the IWW held a meeting to celebrate the martyrs of the Chicago Haymarket Riot. The police closed down the Wobbly meeting place, Germania Hall, before the event could take place. In response, the IWW took their grievances to the streets and began their soapbox free speech campaign. Afterwards, Wobblies who spoke \"on the soapbox\" were jailed, \"fingerprinted, photographed in jail and then released.\"\n\nIn response to the Germania Hall incident, the IWW shifted their efforts to a form of soapbox oratory in order to win over a diverse spectrum of the working class, focusing on gaining converts through their speeches. The fifty members of the IWW refocused their efforts to Heller's Corner at the corner of 5th and E Streets, in the center of the Stingaree. The Stingaree contained a mélange of ethnic groups: ranging from whites, white immigrant, blacks, Mexicans, and Chinese, most of which were members of the working class. The Stingaree and Heller's Corner were symbolic hubs for the San Diegan prejudices against different races and lower classes. The Stingaree was home to everything different and unknown that went against the \"mission\" ideal in San Diego, including: saloons, shops, cheap hotels, gambling houses, opium dens and prostitutes. The square block at the corner of Fifth and E Streets was home to more than just debauchery, as it also was the central location for a variety of \"soapbox orators\" including the Salvation Army, Socialists, Holy Rollers, and the Single Taxers. The situation was relatively peaceful and there were no violent run-ins with the police, until after the Germania Hall incident.\n\nThe free speech fight officially began on January 8, 1912, when the San Diego Common Council passed Ordinance No. 4623, which called for a restricted zone of 49-square blocks (more than that which was requested by San Diegans) in the middle of San Diego, encompassing all of \"soapbox row.\" The ordinance came as a result of a recommendation given by the San Diego grand jury and a petition signed by eighty-five prominent citizens and property owners who had hoped to prohibit free speech in a seven-square block zone centered around 5th & E. The meetings blocked traffic, it was officially argued, and that necessitated an ordinance for \"the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, and safety and one of emergency.\" The initial punishment for violating the ordinance was punishable by a $25 to $100 fine and/or thirty days' imprisonment. Prior to passage of the ordinance, the Wobblies, Single Taxers, and Socialists had signed a 250-person petition in which they called for an allowance of unrestricted free speech. This effort countered the petitions previously submitted by the San Diego Grand Jury and the high powered San Diegan citizens, but to no avail.\n\nThere was a period of uncertainty, during which the council delayed its decision. The council may have simply been searching for affirmation from the general public in order to avoid widespread conflict and dismay throughout the city. Some council members \"believed that a referendum would show that the majority of San Diegans favored speaking anywhere at anytime.\"\n\nThe council finally found a reason to pass the ordinance on the evening of January 6, 1912. The Socialists and Single Taxers were holding a soapbox event on the streets when an off-duty constable and real estate man, R.J. Walsh drove his car into a crowd at the closed-off soapbox row. With his horn blaring, he attempted to disrupt the orators. His car was mobbed and its tires were slashed. The police intervened and two days later the San Diego Common Council passed Ordinance 4623 with an emergency clause that called for the immediate cessation of public free speech rights, sidestepping the customary twenty-day implementation wait period. The free speech fight had officially begun.\n\nThe California Free Speech League was created on January 16, 1912, with the support of Socialists, Wobblies, church groups, the AFL and other trade unions. The League attempted to take a legal stand against the free speech restrictions by holding up the Constitution and defending the rights of non-property owning peoples. The League also hired E.E. Kirk as an attorney to provide some legal leverage against the law and its enforcement.\n\nAfter the passage of free speech restrictions, the Wobblies and other groups began testing the ordinance. At a typical IWW street meeting the police left the Wobblies undisturbed and merely relegated themselves to traffic and pedestrian direction. Indeed, the Wobblies and the Socialists believed that they had already won back their free speech rights. But law enforcement was simply adhering to a generally accepted 30-day grace period after the ordinance was enacted. Once the grace period was over, forty-one people were arrested during a parade and demonstration consisting of 5,000 protesters. Those arrested were jailed for twenty-four hours, held initially on a misdemeanor charge. But the prosecutors decided the violators had conspired to break the law, and thus tried the prisoners under a felony charge of conspiracy. The Wobblies and other soapbox speakers then moved their orations out of the restricted zone. But the council passed an ordinance which gave police the ability to arrest anyone that disrupted traffic throughout San Diego.\n\nThe increase in arrests led to the rapid filling of the San Diego jails, causing overcrowding and the rapid decline of prison conditions, increasing Wobbly anger toward law enforcement. The reports about jail conditions were conflicting, but the general trend seems to show that the Wobblies and other pro-free speech detainees were treated badly. The jails filled up so quickly that the police used their sobering rooms or drunk tanks for housing inmates. These tanks had no beds and the arrested were forced to sleep on vermin infested concrete floors. Moreover, police brutality and aggression were rampant, while beatings and other abuses were relatively common throughout the ordeal. Sixty-three-year-old Michael Hoy died on March 28th after the police beat him and withheld medical attention. \n\nThese events coincided with the plan of the Free Speech League to \"glut the jails and then to demand individual jury trials which would clog the courts and bring the legal machinery to a standstill.\" This especially appealed to the IWW, so much so that they called for 20,000 Wobblies to converge on San Diego in order to bring the system to a halt. There were 50 members of local 13 in 1912, but roughly 5,000 Wobblies came to San Diego to participate in the free speech fight. District Attorney Utley tried to offer a compromise to the Wobblies, promising to free the men originally arrested for conspiracy if the IWW ceased its public speaking in the restricted zone. The IWW declined the offer on principle even through its attorney, E.E. Kirk, recommended that they accept the compromise. The arrests continued. The IWW then protested against the detainment and the prison conditions in front of the city jail. Five thousand protesters turned out, and the police indiscriminately blasted people, including women and children, with fire hoses.\n\nThe increase in arrests left Police Chief Keno Wilson with a dilemma; he wanted to punish the protesters, but simultaneously faced overcrowded jails and stockades. After local newspapers began editorializing vociferously against the protesters and their tactics, groups of vigilantes began transporting arrested Wobblies and free speakers to the county line. The vigilantes began patrolling trains that were inbound from the north, and would grab Wobblies and invited speakers before they could get to the city. The vigilantes then proceeded to \"reeducate\" the speakers on patriotism as this brutal first hand account notes: They were drunk and hollering and cursing the rest of the night. In the morning they took us out four or five at a time and marched us up the track to the county line… where were forced to kiss the flag and then run a gauntlet of 106 men, every one of which was striking at us as hard as they could with their pick ax handles. They broke one man's leg, and everyone was beaten black and blue, and was bleeding from a dozen wounds. These incidents occurred quite frequently, but there was no significant outcry from the middle class citizens of San Diego.\n\nThe state of California finally intervened, as Governor Hiram Johnson was flooded with demands for an inquiry into the arrests and vigilantism in San Diego. Governor Johnson sent Colonel Weinstock to act as an investigative commissioner. By all accounts Weinstock was an impartial judge of situation, and he concluded that the arrests and free speech restrictions were unlawful, but that the Wobblies were wrong in their pursuance of an activist stance. Moreover, Weinstock likened the situation to Czarist Russia and suggested the Attorney General take action, but he did not. Although Weinstock's presence caused a temporary cessation in violence, the situation was once again aroused when Joseph Mikolash, a Wobbly, was killed by police in the IWW headquarters in San Diego on May 7. \n\nThe Wobblies reportedly employed firearms against the police in the incident, which led to the discovery of a small arms cache in the IWW headquarters. This increased the public's hostility toward the IWW and toward Weinstock's report, which had defended the Wobblies' constitutional right to free speech.\n\nEmma Goldman and Ben Reitman came to San Diego for Goldman to give her speech \"An Enemy of the People\" on May 15, 1912. When the two arrived at the train station the same women that allegedly needed protection from the soapbox orators yelled \"Give us that anarchist; we will strip her naked; we will tear out her guts.\" Mayor of San Diego James E. Wadham offered a warning, but no help to the two activists. Reitman was abducted by vigilantes from his hotel room and tortured. He later recalled,\nThey tore my clothes off. They knocked me down, and when I lay naked on the ground, they kicked and beat me until I was almost insensible. With a lighted cigar they burned the letters I.W.W. on my buttocks; then they poured a can of tar over my head and, in the absence of feathers, rubbed sage-brush on my body. One of them attempted to push a cane into my rectum. Another twisted my testicles. They forced me to kiss the flag and sing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". When they tired of the fun, they gave me my underwear for fear we should meet any women. They also gave me back my vest, in order that I might carry my money, railroad ticket, and watch. The rest of my clothes they kept. I was ordered to make a speech, and then they commanded me to run the gauntlet. The Vigilantes lined up, and as I ran past them, each one gave me a blow or a kick. Then they let me go.Reitman had not been a member of the IWW, although he was a supporter. Emma Goldman then returned to Los Angeles after being misled into thinking that the Vigilantes had not harmed Reitman but simply put him on a train for Los Angeles. Reitman was released a day later and arrived in Los Angeles badly beaten.\n\nBy the fall of 1912, the soapbox row had been abandoned. The vigilantes ended their terror campaign, for they had brutalized, driven out, or– some believe– possibly murdered anyone who stood up for the right of free speech in San Diego. This was quite a different result from what the IWW had experienced in its other free speech fights around the country. The Wobblies did not return to San Diego until 1914.\n\nFrom the July 11, 1912, edition of the IWW's \"Little Red Songbook\", the first stanza of \"We're Bound For San Diego\":\n\nThe bonus track \"Tar and Sagebrush\", from Anti-Flag's new album, \"The Bright Lights of America\", is a folk punk interpretation of Ben Reitman's description of his torture.\n\n"}

{"id": "2549886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2549886", "title": "Shakespeare Santa Cruz", "text": "Shakespeare Santa Cruz\n\nShakespeare Santa Cruz was an annual professional theatre festival in Santa Cruz, California, which ran from 1981 to 2013. After losing the financial support of the University of California, Santa Cruz, the company was relaunched through crowdfunding as Santa Cruz Shakespeare.\n\nShakespeare Santa Cruz was founded in 1981 and performed annually on the campus of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Plays by Shakespeare and other great dramatists were performed indoors on the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage and outdoors in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen. Bringing in professional actors, directors and designers from throughout the country, the Company's season ran from July to early September and presented three or four plays that ran concurrently in repertory six days a week (no performance on Mondays). With a mission to “cultivate the imagination, wit, daring, and vision that the greatest playwrights demand of artists and audiences alike,\" SSC sought to present a festival of theatre which showcased contemporary approaches to directing, designing and acting. Attendance grew from 7,716 people in 1982 to 31,013 in 1992. Since its founding, the company's artistic directors have been Audrey Stanley (1982–86), Michael Edwards (1987–92), Danny Scheie (1993–95), Risa Brainin, Paul Whitworth (1996–2007), and Marco Barricelli (2008–2013). Some of the rising theatre stars who have worked at SSC are: David Aaron Baker, Bryan Cranston, Maria Dizzia, Dan Donohue, Caitlin FitzGerald, Richard Gunn, Peter Jacobson, Carrie Preston, Reg Rogers, and Michael Stuhlbarg.\nIn 1997, Artistic Director Paul Whitworth introduced the SSC annual Winter Holiday season. In keeping with the tradition of Shakespeare Santa Cruz’s fresh take on the classics, the holiday shows were original musicals written for SSC by playwright Kate Hawley with music composed by Gregg Coffin, Craig Bohmler and Adam Wernick. A fusion of the traditions of the British pantomime and the American musical, \"Cinderella\", \"Gretel and Hansel\", \"The Princess and the Pea\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\" were based on traditional fairy tales and appeal to audiences of all ages. The winter season performed in November and December.\n\nIn addition to the summer repertory season and the holiday show, Shakespeare Santa Cruz had two performance programs which sought to engage student actors with Shakespearean and other classical texts---the summer Fringe show and the Shakespeare to Go program. The Fringe show was an opportunity for the summer Company's acting interns to perform their own production in the Glen two nights each summer. Past productions included \"Lysistrata\", \"The Antipodes\", \"Fools in the Forest\", and \"The Mock-Tempest\". Shakespeare to Go was an educational engagement program—and recipient of National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) funding—featuring University of California Santa Cruz Theater Arts students who toured local schools in the spring performing one-hour versions of one of the full-length plays to be featured in the summer repertory season. Additionally, Shakespeare to Go presented a limited number of free public performances.\n\nThe festival was responsible for supporting itself, but had recently run deficits which were paid by the University of California. In 2008, with California's budget crisis having resulted in reduced funding, the university could no longer afford to cover these debts. An agreement was reached that if the theater could raise $300,000, it could continue operation. Within 10 days of the agreement's announcement, over $400,000 was raised. Claiming continuing financial problems, however, the UCSC Arts Division dean announced several years later that Shakespeare Santa Cruz would end after its 2013 holiday production.\n\nFollowing this announcement, the theater company began a campaign to raise money to become an independent company. By February 2014, they raised over $1 million (USD) through crowdfunding to continue on without the financial support of the university. In March 2014, the new company changed its name to Santa Cruz Shakespeare.\n\n\n"}

It was also visible in the Atlantic. A very small portion occurred in the Southern Hemisphere almost entirely over the ocean. It was part of solar saros 133.\n\nThe umbral portion which was as far as 242 km (150 km), it included areas that were 150 miles (250 km) northwest of the Cape Verdean island of Santo Antão (then a Portuguese colony) in the Atlantic, the Spanish controlled Canary Islands, Morocco including Casablanca, Rabat, Tangier and Tetouan, Gibraltar, Spain including Malaga, Valencia and Barcelona, France including Grenoble, Lyon, Nîmes and Marseilles, Switzerland, Munich, Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland), Mazuria, much of the Baltic, Saint Petersburg, Russia, newly founded at the time and a part of the Russian north including the Samoyedic and Yakut areas and up to Manchuria. The greatest occurred in the area between Saxony and Lower Silesia (now in Poland) at 51.5 N, 15.2 E at 9:35 UTC (10:35 CET) and lasted for over 4 minutes.\n\nThe eclipse showed up to 50% obscuration in Burkina Faso, Mai, Songhai, Benghazi in Libya, Ankara, Sinope, the north of the Caspian and a part of Mongola and on the other side, northwestern Islands and the east shore of Greenland. It was 75% obscuration in places like Norway, Lapland and Zemlya and on the other side around Bissau, Syracuse in Sicily and Bucharest. Places that was 25% obscuration of the sun included Kingdom of Benin, Egypt and Babylon in Iraq (then commonly as Mesopotamia). Areas that were on the rim of the eclipse included Gabon, Darfur, Nubia, the north of the Arabian Peninsula, Persia, the Arghan Empire, Nepal, Assam and Manchurian controlled Yunnan.\n\nThe eclipse started in the middle of the Atlantic and finished at sunset in Siberia, Korea and China.\n\nThe subsolar marking was in Nubia.\n\nThe eclipse was the first to be the subject of predictive maps. Unlike the famous Halley's eclipse of 1715, the eclipse was not total in England. However John Flamsteed, based on a letter by a Captayn Stanyan in Bern, reported to the Royal Society that, for the first time to his knowledge, someone \"took notice of a red streak preceding the emersion of the sun's body from a total eclipse\", erroneously attributing it to the atmosphere of the Moon. Also Johann Jakob Scheuchzer reported on the eclipse's \"red streak\" relating it to the Moon's atmosphere. \nThe eclipse also coincided with the Grand Alliance victory at Barcelona and was widely interpreted as the “eclipse of Sun King”, i. e. the dimming of Louis XIV, king of France, while the French court officially regarded the eclipse only as a scientific phenomenon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "358988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358988", "title": "Spirit of St. Louis", "text": "Spirit of St. Louis\n\nThe Spirit of St. Louis (Registration: N-X-211) is the custom-built, single engine, single-seat, high wing monoplane that was flown by Charles Lindbergh on May 20 – 21, 1927, on the first solo nonstop transatlantic flight from Long Island, New York, to Paris, France, for which Lindbergh won the $25,000 Orteig Prize.\n\nLindbergh took off in the \"Spirit\" from Roosevelt Airfield, Garden City, New York, and landed 33 hours, 30 minutes later at Aéroport Le Bourget in Paris, France, a distance of approximately 3,600 miles (5,800 km). One of the best-known aircraft in the world, the \"Spirit\" was built by Ryan Airlines in San Diego, California, owned and operated at the time by Benjamin Franklin Mahoney, who had purchased it from its founder, T. Claude Ryan, in 1926. The \"Spirit\" is on permanent display in the main entryway's \"Milestones of Flight\" gallery at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nOfficially known as the \"Ryan NYP\" (for \"N\"ew \"Y\"ork to \"P\"aris), the single-engine monoplane was designed by Donald A. Hall of Ryan Airlines and named the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" in honor of Lindbergh's supporters from the St. Louis Raquette Club in his then hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. To save design time, the NYP was loosely based on the company's 1926 Ryan M-2 mailplane, the main difference being the NYP's 4,000-mile range. As a nonstandard design, the government assigned it the registration number N-X-211 (for \"experimental\"). Hall documented his design in \"Engineering Data on the \"Spirit of St. Louis\"\", which he prepared for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and is included as an appendix to Lindbergh's 1953 Pulitzer Prize winning book \"The Spirit of St. Louis\".\n\nB.F. \"Frank\" Mahoney and Claude Ryan had co-founded the company as an airline in 1925 and Ryan remained with the company after Mahoney bought out his interest in 1926, although there is some dispute as to how involved Ryan may have been in its management after selling his share. It is known, however, that Hawley Bowlus was the factory manager who oversaw construction of the Ryan NYP, and that Mahoney was the sole owner at the time of Donald A. Hall's hiring.\n\nThe \"Spirit\" was designed and built in San Diego to compete for the $25,000 Orteig Prize for the first nonstop flight between New York and Paris. Hall and Ryan Airlines staff worked closely with Lindbergh to design and build the \"Spirit\" in just 60 days. Although what was actually paid to Ryan Airlines for the project is not clear, Mahoney agreed to build the plane for $6,000 and said that there would be no profit; he offered engine, instruments, etc. at cost. After first approaching several major aircraft manufacturers without success, in early February 1927 Lindbergh, who as a U.S. Air Mail pilot was familiar with the good record of the M-1 with Pacific Air Transport, wired, \"Can you construct Whirlwind engine plane capable flying nonstop between New York and Paris ...?\"\n\nMahoney was away from the factory, but Ryan answered, \"Can build plane similar M-1 but larger wings... delivery about three months.\" Lindbergh wired back that due to competition, delivery in less than three months was essential. Many years later, Jon van der Linde, chief mechanic of Ryan Airlines, recalled, \"But nothing fazed B.F. Mahoney, the young sportsman who had just bought Ryan.\" Mahoney telegraphed Lindbergh back the same day: \"Can complete in two months.\"\n\nLindbergh arrived in San Diego on February 23 and toured the factory with Mahoney, meeting Bowlus, chief engineer Donald Hall, and sales manager A. J. Edwards. After further discussions between Mahoney, Hall and Lindbergh, Mahoney offered to build the \"Spirit\" for $10,580, restating his commitment to deliver it in 60 days. Lindbergh contributed $2,000 toward the cost of the \"Spirit\" that he had saved from his earnings as an Air Mail pilot for Robertson Aircraft Corporation. The rest was provided by the Spirit of St. Louis Organization.\n\nLindbergh was convinced: \"I believe in Hall's ability; I like Mahoney's enthusiasm. I have confidence in the character of the workmen I've met.\" He then went to the airfield to familiarize himself with a Ryan aircraft, either an M-1 or an M-2, then telegraphed his St. Louis backers and recommended the deal, which was quickly approved.\n\nMahoney lived up to his commitment. Working exclusively on the aircraft and closely with Lindbergh, the staff completed the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" 60 days after Lindbergh arrived in San Diego. Powered by a Wright Whirlwind J-5C 223-hp radial engine, it had a 14 m (46-foot) wingspan, 3 m (10 ft) longer than the M-1, to accommodate the heavy load of 1,610 L (425 gal) of fuel. In his 1927 book \"We\", Lindbergh acknowledged the builders' achievement with a photograph captioned \"The Men Who Made the Plane\", identifying: \"B. Franklin Mahoney, president, Ryan Airlines\", Bowlus, Hall and Edwards standing with the aviator in front of the completed aircraft.\n\nLindbergh believed that multiple engines resulted in a greater risk of failure while a single engine design would give him greater range. To increase fuel efficiency, the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" was also one of the most advanced and aerodynamically streamlined designs of its era.\n\nLindbergh believed that a flight made in a single-seat monoplane designed around the dependable Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial engine provided the best chance of success. The Ryan NYP had a total fuel capacity of or of gasoline, which was necessary in order to have the range to make the anticipated flight non-stop. The fuel was stored in five fuel tanks, a forward tank – , the main – , and three wing tanks – total of . Lindbergh modified the design of the plane's \"trombone struts\" attached to the landing gear to provide a wider wheel base in order to accommodate the weight of the fuel.\n\nAt Lindbergh's request, the large main and forward fuel tanks were placed in the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This arrangement improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine in the event of a crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that forward visibility would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.\n\nLindbergh sat in a cramped cockpit which was 94 cm wide, 81 cm long and 130 cm high (36 in × 32 in × 51 in). The cockpit was so small, Lindbergh could not stretch his legs. The \"Spirit of St. Louis\" was powered by a , air-cooled, nine-cylinder Wright J-5C Whirlwind radial engine. The engine was rated for a maximum operating time of 9,000 hours (more than one year if operated continuously), and had a special mechanism that could keep it clean for the entire New York-to-Paris flight. It was also, for its day, very fuel-efficient, enabling longer flights carrying less fuel weight for given distances. Another key feature of the Whirlwind radial engine was that it was rated to self-lubricate the engine's valves for 40 hours continuously. Lubricating, or \"greasing,\" the moving external engine parts was a necessity most aeronautical engines of the day required, to be done manually by the pilot or ground crew prior to every flight and would have been otherwise required somehow to be done during the long flight.\n\nThe engine was built at Wright Aeronautical in Paterson, New Jersey by a 24-year-old engine builder, Tom Rutledge, who was disappointed that he was assigned to the unknown aviator, Lindbergh. Four days after the flight, he received a letter of congratulations from the Wright management.\n\nThe race to win the prize required time-saving design compromises. Donald A. Hall decided that the empennage (tail assembly) and wing control surfaces would not be altered from his original Ryan M-2 design, thus minimizing redesign time that was not available without delaying the flight. The result was less aerodynamic stability; nevertheless, the experienced Lindbergh approved the unaltered design. This setup resulted in a negatively stable design that tended to randomly introduce unanticipated pitch, yaw, and bank (roll) elements into its overall flight characteristics. There is dispute regarding whether Hall and Lindbergh also preferred this design because they anticipated that the continuous corrections to the random movements of the aircraft would help to keep Lindbergh awake during the estimated 40-hour flight. Whether or not the unstable design was deliberately retained to help fight fatigue, Lindbergh did later write how these random unanticipated movements helped keep him awake at various times during the flight. The stiff wicker seat in the cockpit was also purposely uncomfortable, although custom fitted to Lindbergh's tall and lanky frame.\nLindbergh also insisted that unnecessary weight be eliminated, even going so far as to cut the top and bottom off of his flight map. He carried no radio in order to save weight and because the radios of the period were unreliable and difficult to use while flying solo. Also, although he was an airmail pilot, he refused to carry souvenir letters on the transatlantic journey, insisting that every spare ounce be devoted to fuel. The fuselage was made of treated fabric over a metal tube frame, while the wings were made of fabric over a wood frame. The plywood material that was used to build most of Lindbergh's plane was made at the Haskelite Manufacturing Corporation in Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n\nA small, left-facing Indian-style swastika was painted on the inside of the original propeller spinner of the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" along with the names of all the Ryan Aircraft employees who designed and built it. It was meant as a message of good luck prior to Lindbergh's solo Atlantic crossing as the symbol was often used as a popular good luck charm with early aviators and others. The inside of the original propeller spinner can be viewed at the National Air and Space Museum. This propeller spinner was found to be cracked when Lindbergh arrived at New York prior to his transatlantic flight. The propeller spinner that is on the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" now was hastily made in New York to replace the cracked original and was on the aircraft during the transatlantic flight.\n\nLindbergh's New York-to-Paris flight made him an instant celebrity and media star. In winning the Orteig Prize, Lindbergh stirred the public's imagination. He wrote: \"I was astonished at the effect my successful landing in France had on the nations of the world. It was like a match lighting a bonfire.\" Lindbergh subsequently flew the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" to Belgium and England before President Calvin Coolidge sent the light cruiser to bring them back to the United States. Arriving on June 11, Lindbergh and the \"Spirit\" were escorted up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C., by a fleet of warships, multiple flights of military pursuit aircraft, bombers, and the rigid airship where President Coolidge presented the 25-year-old U.S. Army Reserve aviator with the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\nOn the same day, the U.S Post Office issued a commemorative 10-cent \"Lindbergh Air Mail\" stamp depicting the \"Spirit\" over a map of its flight from New York to Paris, and which was also the first stamp issued by the post office that bore the name of a living person.\n\nOver the next 10 months, Lindbergh flew the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" on promotional and goodwill tours across the United States and Latin America. According to the published log of the \"Spirit,\" during his 3 month tour of the US, he allowed Major Thomas Lamphier (Commander of the 1st Pursuit Squadron, Selfridge Field) and Lieutenant Philip R. Love (classmate in flight school and colleague of Lindbergh's in the airmail service of Robertson Aircraft Corporation) to pilot the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" for ten minutes each on July 1 and August 8, 1927, respectively. These two are apparently the only persons other than Lindbergh who ever piloted the \"Spirit of St. Louis.\"\nJust one year and two days after making their first flight at Dutch Flats in San Diego, California, on April 28, 1927, Lindbergh and the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" flew together for the final time while making a hop from St. Louis to Bolling Field, in Washington, D.C., on April 30, 1928. There he presented his monoplane to the Smithsonian Institution where for more than eight decades it has been on display, hanging for 48 years (1928–76) in the Arts and Industries Building and today hanging, since 1976, in the atrium of the National Air and Space Museum alongside the Bell X-1 and SpaceShipOne. At the time of its retirement, the \"Spirit\" had made 174 flights, totaling 489:28 hours in the air.\n\nWhile in other respects the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" appears today much as it appeared on its accession into the Smithsonian collection in 1928, the gold color of the aircraft's aluminum nose panels is an artifact of well-intended early conservation efforts. Not long after the museum took possession of the \"Spirit\", conservators applied a clear layer of varnish or shellac to the forward panels in an attempt to preserve the flags and other artwork painted on the engine cowling. This protective coating has yellowed with age, resulting in the golden hue seen today. Smithsonian officials have indicated that the varnish will be removed and the nose panels restored to their original silver appearance the next time the aircraft is taken down for conservation.\nHowever, the Smithsonian has subsequently reversed this stance, deciding that the golden hue on its engine cowling will remain, as it is part of the aircraft's natural state after acquisition and during its years on display. The effort to preserve artifacts is not to alter them but to maintain them as much as possible in the state in which the Smithsonian acquired them. Also, when the aircraft was recently lowered to the floor of the museum's Milestone's gallery, the tires were removed and replaced with 'forklift' style tires. This was done to preserve the Spirit's original tires which, due to age and lessening of vulcanization, are unable to sustain the aircraft's weight without disintegration (conservation was also likely undertaken on the wheel assembly itself).\n\nNYP-2, an exact duplicate of the \"Spirit of St. Louis\", was built 45 days after the transatlantic flight, for the Japanese newspaper \"Mainichi\". The NYP-2 carrying serial number 29 was registered as \"J-BACC\" and achieved a number of record-breaking flights early in 1928 before a crash ended its career.\n\nAlthough Ryan capitalized on the notoriety of the NYP special, further developments were only superficially comparable to the \"Spirit of St. Louis\". An offshoot of the Ryan B-1 Brougham emerged as a five-seater with the same J-5 engine but modified with a conventional cockpit layout and a shorter wingspan. Under the newly restructured B.F. Mahoney Company, further development continued with the six-place Model B-7 utilizing a 420 hp engine and the Model C-1 with the basic 220 hp engine. \n\nShortly after the original \"Spirit\" was retired in April 1928, the Mahoney Aircraft Corporation presented Lindbergh with a Mahoney Ryan B-1 \"Brougham\". In 1928, Mahoney built a B-1X as a gift for Charles Lindbergh.\n\nPilot Frank Hawks purchased a Mahoney Ryan B-1 Brougham (NC3009) with money from his wife, naming the plane the \"Spirit of San Diego.\" In the aftermath of the media exposure surrounding Lindbergh's transatlantic flight, he flew to Washington with his wife on board to greet the triumphant Lindbergh. Due to the ensuing publicity, Hawks was hired by the Ryan Aircraft company to be its official representative. Hawks went on to tour the country, selling rides in the aircraft \"like Lindy flew.\"\n\nThe Mahoney Ryan B-1 \"Brougham\" was also used as the basis of a reproduction of the \"Spirit of St. Louis\". The reproduction was used in the 1938 Paramount film \"Men with Wings\" starring Ray Milland.\n\nAll three reproductions from the Warner Bros. film \"The Spirit of St Louis\" (1956) have survived with B-153 on display at the Missouri History Museum, in St. Louis, B-156 is part of the collection at The Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and B-159 belongs to the Cradle of Aviation Museum located in Garden City, Long Island, New York, not far from the site of Roosevelt Field from which the original departed in 1927. According to information at the Henry Ford Museum, their copy (B-156) was actually owned by James Stewart, who portrayed Lindbergh in the film. Stewart is credited as having donated the aircraft to the Henry Ford. Lindbergh was reputed to have flown one of the reproductions during the film's production, however, the connection to Lindbergh is now considered a myth.\nOn the 40th anniversary of Lindbergh's flight, a new reproduction named \"Spirit 2\" was built by movie stunt pilot Frank Tallman. It first flew on April 24, 1967 and appeared at the 1967 Paris Air Show where it made several flights over Paris. In 1972, \"Spirit 2\" was bought for $50,000 by the San Diego Air & Space Museum (formerly San Diego Aerospace Museum) and placed on public display until it was destroyed by arson in 1978. The museum built a replacement named \"Spirit 3\" which first flew on April 28, 1979; it made seven flights before being placed on display. In August 2003, the \"Spirit 3\" was removed from display and was flown as a 75th Anniversary tribute to Lindbergh. The aircraft is now on display in the museum's rotunda.\n\nThrough the efforts of both staff and volunteers, the Experimental Aircraft Association in Oshkosh, Wisconsin produced two reproductions of the \"Spirit of St. Louis\", powered by Continental R-670-4 radial engines, the first in 1977 (the first of which was to be based on a conversion from a B-1 Brougham; the aircraft proved to be too badly deteriorated to be used in that manner) to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Lindbergh’s flight across the Atlantic Ocean and subsequent tour of the United States. This example is now on display in the main museum gallery. A second reproduction, started from scratch in 1977 and first flown in November 1990, continues to fly at air shows and commemorative events. Both of the EAA reproductions were registered under the original's N-X-211.\n\nAnother airworthy reproduction was built by David Cannavo and first flown in 1979, powered by a Lycoming R-680 engine. In 1995, it was bought by Kermit Weeks for his Fantasy of Flight Museum in Polk City, Florida.\n\nA reproduction of the \"Spirit\" (Registration ES-XCL), which had been built and certified in Estonia in 1997, was written off on May 31, 2003. Shortly after takeoff at an air show in Coventry, England, structural failure occurred, resulting in a fatal crash, killing its owner-pilot, Captain Pierre Holländer. \n\nA recently completed \"Spirit\" reproduction, intended for airworthiness is owned by the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome (ORA), fulfilling a lifelong dream of its primary founder, Cole Palen (1925–1993). The reproduction project had been started by Cole before his own death, and has mostly been subsequently built by former ORA pilot and current vintage aircraft maintenance manager Ken Cassens, receiving its wing covering, completed with doped fabric in 2015. A restored Wright J-5 Whirlwind radial was obtained by Palen in the 1970s for the project's start, with original, and still functional 1920s-era flight instruments being incorporated — including the same basic type of earth inductor compass used by Lindbergh — matching the ones in the original \"Spirit\" at the NASM, with the goal of becoming the most authentic airworthy reproduction of the \"Spirit\" yet built.\n\nThis reproduction aircraft successfully flew in early December 2015 in upstate New York, piloted by aircraft restorer/builder Ken Cassens of Stone Ridge, New York. The aircraft made its public debut flight on May 21, 2016, the 89th anniversary of Lindbergh's flight.\n\nA 90% static reproduction built in 1956 for \"The Spirit of St Louis\" film by studio employees is now on display at the Wings of the North Air Museum in Eden Prairie, MN. In 1999, the San Diego Air & Space Museum built a non-flying example which was fitted with an original Wright J-5 engine. It is on display at San Diego International Airport. A static reproduction of the \"Spirit of St. Louis\" was built in 2002 and is on display at St. Louis Lambert International Airport. The Octave Chanute Aerospace Museum at Rantoul, Illinois also has a static reproduction built by museum volunteers. Two reproductions are also found in Germany, one at the Frankfurt International Airport with the second in the \"Luftfahrtmuseum Hannover\". \n\n"}

On June 27, her body was found by a fisherman, floating in the San Joaquin River east of Antioch, California near its bridge, east of San Francisco. On December 11, 2017, after extensive DNA analysis, 63-year-old Mitchell Lynn Bacom, a local registered sex offender, was arrested as the prime suspect. This was Antioch's oldest cold case murder. \"We never gave up on bringing this case to a successful resolution,\" said Antioch Police Chief Tammany Brooks. At the time of Bombardier's homicide, Bacom, currently residing in the 300 block of Madill Street, Antioch, was known to her family. He has been a person of interest all along. Bombardier was raped, stabbed in the chest, and her heart was punctured. The Antioch Police Department states that she was kidnapped from her sister's 3421 Hudson Street townhome in Antioch while she was babysitting her nieces. Her sister, Stephanie Mullen, arrived home at 4:00 a.m. to find Bombardier missing. Bombardier's father, Ted, said that she knew her killer, as there was no forced entry. Bacom is a violent convicted criminal with a long record. Authorities will attempt to match up his DNA to other cold cases. He is being charged with kidnapping, rape, oral copulation, murder, and murder with use of a deadly weapon.\n\nFourteen-year-old Bombardier was an honor roll student at Antioch Junior High at the time of her homicide. She also belonged to the California Junior Scholastic Federation. She was buried at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Lafayette. Jennifer Kathleen Gibbons came across her grave in 2014 and started blogging about the unsolved case. This kept it top of mind for the public and later for investigators.\n\nIn 2015, DNA samples from Bombardier's case were sent to the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office Forensic Laboratory for them to create a DNA profile. In early 2017, after advancements in DNA analysis technology, Antioch police were notified that a CODIS hit was made that tentatively identified Bacom as the perpetrator. After additional testing, when the samples were conclusively linked to Bacom through a federal DNA database, he was taken into custody without incident at his home.\n\nIn 1973 Bacom was tried for several crimes, convicted, and sentenced to five years to life imprisonment. In 1981 he was convicted for several more crimes and sentenced to 24 years in prison. In 2002 he failed to register as a sex offender and was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nMitchell Lynn Bacom (born March 21, 1954) is a native of Knightsen, California. He has brown eyes, and brown hair. He stands five-feet seven-inches tall, and weighs 185 pounds.\n\n"}
{"id": "975325", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=975325", "title": "Strictly Come Dancing", "text": "Strictly Come Dancing\n\nStrictly Come Dancing (informally known as Strictly) is a British television dance contest in which celebrities partner with professional dancers to compete in a ballroom and Latin dance. Each couple is scored out of 10 by a panel of judges. The format has been exported to over 40 other countries, and has also inspired a modern dance-themed spin-off \"Strictly Dance Fever\". The show is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman.\n\nThe show has run on BBC One since 15 May 2004, primarily on Saturday evenings with a following Sunday night results show (with certain exceptions) and with its high viewing figures \"Strictly Come Dancing\" has become a significant programme in British popular culture. The fifteenth series ended on 16 December 2017. A further eleven stand-alone Christmas specials have also been produced, in consecutive years from 2004 onwards. Nine charity specials have also been produced since 2008. Since the fourth series, the show has also been aired in high definition on BBC HD, and BBC One HD from series 8.\n\nOn 7 November 2013 it was announced that Sir Bruce Forsyth would be retiring from presenting the main series. While intended to return as host for each Children in Need and Christmas special, he only did so for the Christmas special in 2014 and the Children in Need special in 2015. He sent a video message for the 2015 Christmas special as he was unable to appear due to his illness. Forsyth died on 18 August 2017.\n\nProducer Richard Hopkins, who had produced the first UK series of \"Big Brother\", unsuccessfully pitched the idea of a modern \"Come Dancing\" to the BBC under the title of Pro-Celebrity Dancing in 2003. Later, entertainment executive Fenia Vardanis also suggested reviving \"Come Dancing\", so Jane Lush, the then head of BBC Entertainment, put Hopkins and Vardanis together to develop the show.\n\nHopkins then called in Karen Smith, who had just produced \"Comic Relief Does Fame Academy\" for BBC One and \"The Games\" for Channel 4, to help lead the development of the show and launch the series. Smith was the show running Executive Producer of the first three series, and of sister show \"\". She then took the role of Creative Director of BBC Entertainment whilst still overseeing series 4 and 5.\n\nHopkins later took the format to America himself when the BBC dismissed the idea of selling it abroad, as they felt it was too British.\n\nFrom series 1 to 11, Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly presented the pro-celebrity ballroom dancing competition. From series 8 to 11, Forsyth only presented the main show and was replaced for the results show by Claudia Winkleman, at which point Daly assumed Forsyth's role as main presenter and Winkleman assumed Daly's role as co-presenter. Winkleman has joined Daly as full-time co-presenter for series 12 following Forsyth's departure after the 2013 series. Through telephone voting, viewers vote for who they would like to be in the next round, the results of the poll being combined with the ranking of the judges. For example, with ten contestants left, the judges' favourite would receive ten points, second favourite nine points, and so on, and similarly with the viewers' rankings. The bottom ranked couple gets one point. The profits from the telephone lines were donated to Sport Relief in series 1, and to Children in Need from series 2 to 5.\n\nThe show is broadcast live on BBC One on Saturday evenings, and is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (however Zoë Ball covered for Winkleman for a number of weeks in 2014). Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show. For some of the second series, Natasha Kaplinsky stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of Bruno Tonioli, Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood. Alesha Dixon took Phillips' place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge \"Britain's Got Talent\" which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her; Bussell remains a judge alongside Tonioli and Revel Horwood. Tonioli commutes weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is Alan Dedicoat. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast \"as live\" on the Sunday.\n\nThe singers on the show are Tommy Blaize, Hayley Sanderson, Lance Ellington, Andrea Grant and formerly the well known UK dance music vocalist Tara McDonald. The music director is David Arch. Tommy Blaize has been part of \"Strictly\" since its beginning. David Arch joined in the fourth series and Hayley Sanderson in the fifth.\n\nThe show was broadcast from a specially constructed set at the BBC Television Centre, moving to the Elstree Studios in 2013. However, in the first two series, shows were also filmed at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool, where the original \"Come Dancing\" series was filmed in the 1970s.\n\nIn the second series, two shows were filmed at the Tower Ballroom, show five and the Grand Final which was broadcast live on 11 December 2004. In 2005 though the BBC announced that they would not be returning to the venue for the third series due to \"logistical problems\". In October 2008, Craig Revel Horwood called for the series to return to the Tower Ballroom, saying, \"the atmosphere was electric. It's huge and has so much history. The Tower Ballroom puts a lot of pressure on the professionals and the celebrities to perform to the best of their potential. What a wonderful place to go live to 12 million people. We have got to get the BBC to bring Strictly Come Dancing back to Blackpool.\" Eventually, the show did return to the Tower Ballroom, for series 7, where Blackpool-born Craig Kelly was eliminated. The episode was aired live on 7 November 2009. \"Strictly Come Dancing\" returned to Blackpool for the 2010 and 2011 series. Then after series 10 when \"Strictly Come Dancing\" did not go to Blackpool, they announced that they would return for series 11.\n\n\n\n\n\nKey:\n\n\nSome of the dancers form professional partnerships, dancing together competitively or on the show. Darren Bennet and Lilia Kopylova, and James and Ola Jordan are married, while Matthew and Nicole Cutler are divorced but still professional partners. Anton du Beke and Erin Boag have danced as a professional couple since 1997; Vincent Simone and Flavia Cacace are a former Argentine Tango world champion couple. Brendan Cole and Katya Virshilas danced professionally for several years before parting in November 2009. Karen Hauer and Kevin Clifton were engaged when Kevin entered the show in 2013 and were married prior to the 2015 season, Janette Manrara and Aljaž Škorjanec were married in 2017. Neil and Katya Jones are also married.\n\nOn average, dances last for approximately 90 seconds. The music for the dances are performed by The Strictly Come Dancing Band.\n\nPrior to series 10, the dances performed in the early weeks are switched between one Ballroom and one Latin, and are divided as evenly as possible depending on the number of contestants left. As the competition progressed further, this system is abandoned and many styles, not just two, can be performed in one week by each of the remaining contestants. From series 4 through 7, the remaining contestants who made it to the semi-finals are granted to perform the semi-final-exclusive Argentine Tango. Beginning with series 10, this has all changed. The contestants are now allowed to dance whichever dance they are bestowed to (not accustomed to any patterns), though the Argentine Tango remains to be somewhat reserved for the latter stages of the series. The Showdance, however, is still restricted only for the finalists from the very first series until now.\n\nAs of series four, coaches are Jaclyn Spencer and Chris Marques (aka Cuban Groove) for Salsa and Mambo, and Jenny Thomas and Ryan Francois for Swing, Jive, Rock n Roll and The Charleston. The Argentine Tango coaches in series three were Flavia Cacace and Vincent Simone, both of whom have subsequently competed in the show.\n\nFrom Series 1-4, the results show was shown live, later on the Saturday after 1 hour after the performances.\n\nFrom Series 5 onwards, the results show is recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show and incorporates the result of the viewers' votes which are completed by 21:30. This was confirmed by the official BBC website in 2008:\n\nThroughout the Sunday results show the presenters refer to 'last night' in reference to the main show, due to the timing of the Sunday programme, and Tess Daly, Claudia Winkleman's and the judges' outfits are changed to present an illusion of a second live broadcast.\n\nFor Series 7, the Sunday results show was axed and put back to Saturday nights as a result of a revamp of the show. It was then put back on Sundays in Series 8.\n\nA new system called the dance-off was introduced in series 5. It continued on the program through series 7, was not used for series 8 and 9, but was reinstated as of series 10 and has remained a feature of the show ever since. There are two couples in each dance-off, which occurs on the results show: the two who received the lowest totals that week from the combined judges' scores and the public vote. The aim of the dance-off is for the couples to convince the judges that they deserve to go through to the following week's competition. Before they attempt the dance a second time the couple sometimes gets advice from the judges. The judges decide who continues on the show and who is eliminated based on the second dance performances. If three of the judges agree that one of the couples should be \"saved\", that couple is through to the following week's competition and the Head Judge's vote is not counted. If one couple has two votes and the other couple has one vote, then the deciding vote is cast by the Head Judge, originally Len Goodman and currently Shirley Ballas. Afterwards, the eliminated couple perform one final dance—some people call it waltzing out of the ballroom. The Monday after they are eliminated they appear on \"\" to talk about their time on the show. The dance-off has been cancelled only once, in series 14, due to an injury sustained earlier by one of the contestants, Anastacia. She was unable to perform the dance-off, and the couple with the lowest total was eliminated.\n\nDuring the run of \"Strictly Come Dancing\", \"Strictly: It Takes Two\" is broadcast each weeknight on BBC Two. The series was previously hosted by Claudia Winkleman; but, due to her pregnancy in 2011, she had to leave the series, and Zoë Ball took over from Series 9.\n\nThe show features reviews of the performances during the previous Saturday's show, and interviews with, and training footage of, the couples preparing for the next show. The judges and other celebrities also provide their opinions on how the couples are doing. \"It Takes Two\" replaced \"Strictly Come Dancing on Three\", hosted by Justin Lee Collins, which ran on BBC Three during the first series. Prior to 2010, BBC Two Scotland aired the programme on four nights only, running their own Gaelic-language programming on Thursdays instead.\n\nIn Spring 2004, \"Strictly Come Dancing\" commenced its first series. The professional dancers were: Brendan, Hanna, Anton, Erin, John, Paul, Camilla and Kylie. This is the only series that took place in the Spring/Summer months. From the second series onwards, the show takes place from September/October to December each year. Natasha Kaplinsky & Brendan Cole were crowned the first winners of Strictly Come Dancing. This was the shortest series, with 8 weeks.\n\nIn Autumn 2004, the second series commenced. 5 of the 8 professionals returned. These professionals were: Brendan, Anton, Erin, Paul and Camilla. There were 5 new professionals who are: Darren, Ian, Lilia, Nicole and Hazel. Hazel only participated in this series while the other professionals competed in following series.\n\nA new spin-off show called \"\" presented by Claudia Winkleman was created this series and has continued to air alongside each following series, now hosted by Zoë Ball on BBC Two.\n\nIn 2005, the third series commenced. Brendan, Anton, Erin, Camilla, Darren, Ian and Lilia returned from last series. Nicole, Paul and Hazel did not return. They were replaced by Karen, Hanna, Izabela, Andrew and Matthew.\n\nThe celebrities that took part in this series were as follows:\n\nThe show ran from 7 October to 23 December 2006. Over 12 million votes were cast, raising £1.5 million for Children in Need. A peak of 13 million viewers tuned into the final show of series four to see Mark and Karen crowned 2006 \"Strictly Come Dancing\" champions.\n\nThis series introduced four new professional dancers – Flavia Cacace, James Jordan, Ola Jordan and Vincent Simone. Andrew Cuerden, Hanna Haarala and Izabela Hannah did not return to the series. This series also saw the return of Nicole Cutler, who had taken part in Series 2 but not in Series 3.\n\nThe couples in order of elimination:\n\nThe fifth series of \"Strictly Come Dancing\" began on BBC One on 29 September 2007, with Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly returning as presenters. For the first and only time, the line up of professionals was unchanged from the previous series. The first programme was a catch-up show and preview to the new series, before the start of the competition on 6 October, which ran for 12 weeks.\n\nThe show featured 14 new celebrities, who were paired with 14 professional dancers. In a change to the previous format, the results show was recorded on Saturday and broadcast on Sunday, rather than shown live later on Saturday. In addition to this, the two couples who were at the bottom of the table after the viewers' vote were subject to a dance-off, where they reprised their routine, for the judges to decide who left. Head Judge Len Goodman had the casting vote in case of a tie. The series raised just over a million pounds for Children in Need.\n\nA sixth series of the show was confirmed after the dancers' pay dispute was called off in late June 2008. The series lasted for 14 weeks, which is the longest series so far. The series involved three new professional dancers, Brian Fortuna, Hayley Holt and Kristina Rihanoff. Nicole Cutler did not return to the series.\n\nIn July 2008 it was reported that current EastEnders cast members were banned from taking part in the competition due to the length of the series.\n\nThe sixth series began on 13 September with a behind-the-scenes look at the new series, followed by the first live show on 20 September.\n\nOn 19 November 2008, John Sergeant announced that he would be leaving the show because he believed he may \"win it\".\n\nThe seventh series of \"Strictly Come Dancing\" ran from 18 September until 19 December 2009. Tess Daly signed a two-year deal to continue presenting the programme for at least the 2009 and 2010 series'.\n\nOn 9 July 2009, former competitor Alesha Dixon was confirmed to be joining the judging panel for this series, and that Darcey Bussell would be a guest judge towards the end of the series run. Dixon replaced Arlene Phillips who moved to \"The One Show\" as a \"Strictly Come Dancing\" expert. It has been reported in the media that many of the show's professional dancers are furious at Phillips being replaced by Dixon. They apparently feel that they \"will be judged by someone who knows less than they do about dancing\". The BBC were also accused of sexism, as none of the male judges on the show had been replaced. The BBC received over 5,000 complaints. Dixon's fans were also unhappy as she had to cancel a number of dates on her autumn tour to do the programme.\n\nThe official line-up was revealed on 25 August 2009 and the winner was \"BBC Breakfast\" presenter Chris Hollins:\n\nThe eighth series of \"Strictly Come Dancing\" began with a launch show on 11 September 2010, then three weeks later the live shows started on 1 October 2010. Three new professional dancers were announced, The celebrities were revealed on 8 September 2010 and the professional partners were revealed during the launch show.\n\nStrictly returned with a launch show on 10 September 2011, with the final in December at the Tower Ballroom, Blackpool. Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly returned to front the main show, and Claudia Winkleman presented the Sunday night results show along with Daly.\n\nFor \"\", a new presenter joined the team. Winkleman had to pull out of the 2011 series as it would be difficult to do a daily programme so soon after giving birth and was replaced by Zoë Ball.\n\nAll of series eight's judges returned to the show.

Caroline Flack and Pasha Kovalev, and Danny Mac and Oti Mabuse both hold the record for most perfect scores with four forties. Kovalev also holds the record for most perfect scores by a professional dancer with eight forties. On another eight occasions, a couple scored 40/40 on a Christmas Special. The Rumba is the only dance style not to have received the perfect score.\n\nHere is a table showing all of the perfect scores achieved by number of perfect scores\n\nBy Celebrity:\n\nBy Professional:\n\nThe lowest score the judges have ever awarded was 8/40 (1,1,3,3) to Quentin Willson and Hazel Newberry for their Cha Cha Cha. Eleven individual ones have been awarded in the entirety of Strictly Come Dancing, with ten of those coming from Craig Revel Horwood and the other coming from Arlene Philips. Ann Widdecombe holds the current record for the most ones, receiving ones from Revel Horwood for her Salsa, Samba, and Rumba. The biggest margin between two singular judges scores is five, awarded to Jason Wood and Kylie Jones for their Rumba (2,5,7,5), Christopher Parker and Hanna Karttunen for their Tango (2,6,7,6), Fiona Philips and Brendan Cole for their Rumba (1,2,6,4), Gary Rhodes and Karen Hardy for their Cha-Cha-Cha (1,5,6,5), Scott Maslen and Natalie Lowe for their Rumba (4,9,7,8), Mark Benton and Iveta Lukosiute for their Cha-Cha-Cha (3,8,8,7), and Scott Mills and Joanne Clifton for their Samba with Donny Osmond (2,5,7,5,6).\nAlexandra Burke and her partner Gorka Márquez hold the record of most tens with 32, then that is followed by Ricky Whittle and his partner Natalie Lowe with 28. However, if the four tens given by Darcey Bussell during her tenure as a fifth judge are removed, he is behind Danny Mac and Oti Mabuse, with 26 tens, and Rachel Stevens and her partner Vincent Simone and Harry Judd and his partner Aliona Vilani with 25 each. They are followed by Natalie Gumede and Artem Chigvintsev, and Ore Oduba and Joanne Clifton with 24 each, Caroline Flack and Pasha Kovalev with 23, Abbey Clancy and Aljaž Skorjanec with 22, Kara Tointon and Artem Chigvintsev with 21 and Lisa Snowdon and Brendan Cole, Kimberley Walsh and Pasha Kovalev and Denise van Outen and James Jordan with 20. Of these celebrities, Snowdon and Cole and Flack and Kovalev are the only pairings to receive straight tens from the judges in all of their dances in their respective series finals. Flack and Kovalev are the only pair to manage three sets of perfect 40 marks in the final, and also hold the records for the longest consecutive streak of 40 marks with four, that includes their Salsa in the semi-final show, and the longest consecutive streak of tens, that adds to a total of 16.\nGumede and Chigvintsev also have the best average score from the judges out of all contestants on every series being 36.9/40 for their dances. Danny Mac and Oti Mabuse, and Alesha Dixon and her partner Matthew Cutler, follow, with averages of 36.6 and 36.5 respectively. Quentin Willson, Susannah Constantine and Diarmuid Gavin hold averages of 8.0, 12.0 and 13.8, the lowest of any celebrities so far.\n\nThe best and worst performances in each dance according to the judges' marks (out of 40) are as follows (not including scores earned on Christmas or any other specials). \nFor a more accurate comparison Darcey Bussell's scores have been subtracted from the totals of the Series 7 quarter-finalists where relevant; specifically Ali Bastian's American Smooth, Chris Hollins' Charleston and Ricky Whittle's Quickstep. Bussell scored all of them a ten. Whittle's Showdance has not been included as it did not receive the perfect score from Bussell, and therefore cannot be considered the same standard. The Rumba is the only dance that has not received the full mark of 40, the highest score being 39/40. Winner of series 12, Caroline Flack, and runner-up of series 14, Danny Mac, hold the record for receiving the most perfect scores as a celebrity with four. With nine perfect scores, Flack's partner Pasha Kovalev holds the record for most perfect scores by a professional dancer.\n\nTelevision presenter Johnny Ball, who was 74 when he competed in 2012, is the oldest contestant; he was older than magician Paul Daniels and actress Lesley Joseph, who were 72 & 71 when they competed in 2010 & 2016 respectively. Actress Louisa Lytton, who was 17 when she competed in 2006, remains the youngest contestant. Actor Joe McFadden, who was 42 when he competed in 2017, is the oldest series winner and gymnast Louis Smith, who was 23 when he competed in 2012, is the youngest series winner. At 20, Christopher Parker and Matt Di Angelo are the youngest contestants to make it to the finale. while Dr. Pamela Stephenson is the oldest, at the age of 61.\n\nSeries 16 contestant Susannah Constantine holds the record for the lowest overall average score of 12. \nSeries 8 quarter-finalist Ann Widdecombe holds the record for the most lowest scores, with a highest score of 21/40 and lowest score of 12/40. Series 2 contestant Quentin Willson holds the record for the overall lowest score of 8/40 (1,1,3,3) and lowest average 8.0/40.0. Series 11 runner-up Natalie Gumede holds the highest average score with 36.9/40.0. Series 12 winner Caroline Flack and series 14 runner-up Danny Mac hold the record for the most perfect scores with four 40s. Series 13 contestant Jamelia holds the record for being in the most dance-offs, which is 5. Series 15 runner-up Debbie McGee holds the record for getting the earliest ever 40 in the competition which was in week 7, for her Tango. This was also the first 40 with Shirley Ballas as the head judge.\n\nOn 13 December 2008, \"Strictly Come Dancing\" became the subject of press attention and viewer complaints about an error in the voting system during the semi-final of series six. In the show, three couples remained in the competition. After all three had performed and the judges had given their scores, two of the couples were in joint-first position on the leaderboard, while the third - Tom Chambers and Camilla Dallerup - were in last place. This meant that, no matter how many public votes were cast in their favour, it was mathematically impossible for the third-placed couple to survive. This oversight was initially unnoticed by producers until after the public vote became live and viewers were invited to call in and save their favourites at a cost of 15p per vote. Once the mistake was finally realised and the public vote was closed, it was announced that all three couples would be put through to the final; all the votes already cast would count towards the final result of the competition; and viewers could apply for a refund if they wished.\n\nThe BBC received 1800 complants about the incident, while media regulator Ofcom received 297. Jon Beazley, the BBC's Head of Entertainment Production, was interviewed on \"Strictly\"'s spin-off show \"\" on 15 December. He apologised for the oversight, referring to it as an \"unprecedented situation.\" On the same day, the BBC posted a statement on their website, which clarified that an independent adjudicator had been consulted to reach a solution that would offer \"fairness to the viewers who voted and the contestants themselves.\" The BBC also stated that, following the mistake, \"the voting and judging mechanisms used in all BBC voting programmes [had] been thoroughly examined.\"\n\nAfter conducting an investigation, Ofcom concluded that \"the mistake had resulted from an oversight, rather than any shortcomings in the technical arrangements for voting or in the handling of votes received\", and that they were \"satisfied that appropriate steps were taken by the BBC and the disadvantage to viewers minimised.\" Ofcom also opined that: \"the BBC had been open and transparent with viewers about the mistake it made and the solution adopted.\"\n\nIn June 2008, tabloid newspaper \"The Sun\" reported that the then 66-year-old judge Arlene Phillips, who had judged the show since its inception in 2004, was to replaced by series five winner Alesha Dixon, then aged 30. This was later confirmed by the BBC in July of that year. Subsequently, the BBC was accused of ageism and sexism by several sources, an accusation the corporation has faced before over the removal of several older presenters, including Moira Stuart, Juliet Morris, Miriam O'Reilly, Michaela Strachan, Charlotte Smith and Anna Ford. The BBC denied the allegations that the decision to remove Phillips was due to her age.\n\nFurthermore, Dixon herself was criticised after the debut episode of the seventh series, the first to feature her as a judge. A total of 272 complaints were received by the BBC - bringing the total number about Dixon joining the programme to over 4000 - along with over 5000 comments on \"Strictly Come Dancing\"'s internet message board. Dixon was compared unfavourably to Phillips, with claims that the former was \"unsuitable\", \"unqualified\" and lacked \"knowledge, experience and talent\". However, Dixon was praised and defended from her critics by the BBC, by fellow judge Craig Revel Horwood and by Phillips herself.\n\nIn 2009, during the seventh series, professional dancer Anton du Beke issued a public apology for his use of a racial slur during a conversation with his dance partner Laila Rouass. Du Beke claimed that the comment, which was never broadcast, was a joke referring to Rouass' spray-tan, in which he said that she \"looked like a Paki\". Over 600 complaints were received by the BBC, including those about comments Bruce Forsyth, then host of \"Strictly Come Dancing\", made about the controversy on a Talksport radio programme, in which he suggested that Britain \"used to have a sense of humour\" about such incidents, and that du Beke's apology should be accepted.\n\nFollowing the incident, and Forsyth's response, the BBC stated:Racially offensive language in the workplace is entirely unacceptable. Anton was right to apologise quickly and without reservation and Laila has wholly accepted his apology. Everyone is very clear that there can be no repetition of this behaviour.Forsyth also clarified his position:What Anton said to Laila was wrong and he has apologised unreservedly for this. Nor do I in any way excuse or condone the use of such language. To be absolutely clear, the use of racially offensive language is never either funny or acceptable. However, there is a major difference between this and racist comments which are malicious in intent and whilst I accept that we live in a world of extraordinary political correctness, we should keep things in perspective.\n\nIn 2015, in an interview with the \"Daily Mirror\", CJ de Mooi said that he was turned down for the show because he had wanted to dance with a same-sex partner. In response, the BBC said \"Strictly is a family show and we have chosen the traditional format of mixed-sex couples\". The press has reported on the issue on numerous occasions when gay celebrities have appeared on the show, including Will Young, Susan Calman, Robert Rinder, Richard Coles and Ranj Singh. \"Strictly Come Dancing\" judges Shirley Ballas and Craig Revel Horwood have both expressed their support for introducing same-sex couples.\n\nThe so-called \"Strictly curse\" has been blamed for the number of affairs and relationship break-ups that have occurred during or soon after taking part in the show. The first such incident was the suggested affair between dancer Brendan Cole and newsreader Natasha Kaplinsky during the initial series: they both denied the affair, but the surrounding controversy resulted in the ending of both their long term relationships.\n\nAn example of \"Strictly Come Dancing\"s popularity is that after episodes, electricity use in the United Kingdom rises significantly as viewers who have waited for the show to end begin boiling water for tea, a phenomenon known as TV pick-up. National Grid personnel watch the show to know when closing credits begin so they can prepare for the surge.\n\nAll ratings are from BARB. Series averages exclude Christmas special and launch show.\nThe show has won a highly prestigious Rose D'Or award for 'Best Variety Show', beating off competition from reality shows from twelve other different countries. It has also won two awards for 'Best Reality Show' at the TRIC Awards and two at the TV Quick Awards for 'Best Talent Show'. It has also received four BAFTA Award nominations.\n\nThe show won the award of 'Most Popular Talent Show' at the National Television Awards in 2008, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017\n\nIn the Guinness Book of World Records 2010 edition, the format of \"Strictly Come Dancing\" was named the most successful television show with the format being sold to more than 38 countries worldwide.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25010926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25010926", "title": "Teatro San Benedetto", "text": "Teatro San Benedetto\n\nThe Teatro San Benedetto was a theatre in Venice, particularly prominent in the operatic life of the city in the 18th and early 19th centuries. It saw the premieres of over 140 operas, including Rossini's \"L'italiana in Algeri\", and was the theatre of choice for the presentation of \"opera seria\" until La Fenice was built in 1792.\n\nThe small, elegant theatre was first constructed by Michele Grimani on land owned by the Venier family. It was inaugurated on 26 December 1755 with a performance of Gioacchino Cocchi's opera \"Zoe\". In 1766 the ownership of the San Benedetto passed from Grimani to a consortium of patrician families in Venice who had been box holders at the theatre. The original design of the theatre was circular. However it was rebuilt in the traditional horseshoe shape following a fire in 1773. \n\nIn 1765 Vincenzo Galeotti who danced here from 1761 became the ballet master of the theatre and staged his first ballet here (at that time besides Galeotty and his wife Antonia there were two soloists and 16 corps de ballet dancers in the company). In 1772—1773 the ballet master of San Benedetto was Gasparo Angiolini.\n\nIn 1782 Teatro San Benedetto hosted the ball in honour of Count and Countess De Nord, Russian prince Pavel Petrovich and his spouse, visiting Venice. \n\nIn 1786 the owners' consortium had to cede the theatre to the Venier family following a lawsuit, and later went on to build La Fenice. The theatre then became the Teatro Venier (or Teatro Venier in San Benedetto). \n\nIn 1810, the ownership passed to the impresario Giovanni Gallo, and for a time it was known as the Teatro Gallo. His sons, who had inherited the theatre in 1847, renamed it Teatro Rossini in 1868 in honour of Gioachino Rossini whose operas \"L'italiana in Algeri\" and \"Eduardo e Cristina\" had premiered there earlier in the century, but by then its glory days as an opera house were over.\n\nIn 1937 the building was completely remodelled as a movie theater, the Cinema Rossini, with a new facade by the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa. The cinema was closed in 2007 and will undergo restoration in 2010 in a project financed by the City of Venice.\n\n"}

Texas Fear Fest was organized by John Gray and presented in conjunction with horror websites \"Pit of Horror\" and \"Dread Central\". Despite the apparent success of the first three events, the organization collapsed in 2011 due to internal issues which forced the cancellation of scheduled and future events.\n\nThe first Texas Fear Fest was held March 23–25, 2007, at the Mesquite Convention Center in Mesquite, Texas, and presented by horror websites Pit of Horror and Dread Central.

These sessions were subsequently played on The Dave Fanning Show on Irish-based radio RTÉ 2FM.\n\nProduced by Jim Lockhart and engineered by Phil Cook, the 1991 session was recorded at RTÉ's Studio 8 on March 9, 1991.\nOn May 19, 2010, RTÉ 2FM radio host Dan Hegarty played three tracks (\"Dreams\", \"Uncertain\", Reason\") from the 1991 Dave Fanning Session, nearly 20 years after their first broadcast. Hegarty aired \"Reason\" again a year later on March 17, 2011, then \"Dreams\" on September 7, 2011 during a show broadcast from Limerick. \nThe complete session was broadcast again on October 18, 2011 on Dan Hegarty's show.\nTrack list\n\nIn 1993, the band recorded another Fanning Session. During an interview at RTÉ 2FM, Fergal indicated that the band was recording a new version of \"Wanted\" from their debut album, \"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?\" and three new songs (\"False\", \"Like You Used To\" and \"The Icicle Melts\"). Up to this date, \"False\" and \"Like You Used To\" remain commercially unreleased, while \"The Icile Melts\" was re-recorded and released a year later on the band’s second album, \"No Need to Argue\".\nThe complete session was broadcast again on 7 December 2011 on Dan Hegarty's \"Alternative to Sleep\" show (RTÉ 2FM). \nTrack list\n\nIt is unclear if another Dave Fanning Session took place, since information about the Cranberries’ Fanning Sessions remains scarce and sometimes contradictory in the fan community. In 2002, Zombieguide webmaster, Alex Kraus, received CD-Rs from the Cranberries’ drummer, Fergal Lawler, which contained some tracks identified as being from a 1990 Dave Fanning Session. Since some of the information from those CD-Rs are now know to be inaccurate (e.g., the four 1991 Fanning Session tracks are identified as \"Xeric Demos\"), we cannot confirm the existence of a 1990 Dave Fanning Session. It possible that the information on those CD-R tracks was mixed up sometime between the original tape recording in the early 1990s and the CD transfer, a decade later.\n\nThe Cranberries worked on a studio session for the John Peel show on BBC Radio 1. The session, produced by Dale Griffin and engineered by Nick Gomm, was recorded at Maida Vale 4 on January 16, 1992 and broadcast a month later, on February 16. It featured four songs that were later re-recorded for the band’s first album. The four tracks were broadcast again on the April 24, 1992 show. Recordings of the John Peel Session appeared on an unauthorized bootleg CD entitled \"Be With You\".\n\nTrack list\n\nThe Cranberries recorded a BBC Radio 1 Evening Session, which was broadcast on September 26, 1994. The recording session was produced by James Birtwistle. \"I Can't Be With You\" and \"Empty\" from that session were included on the \"I Can't Be With You\" single while \"Zombie\" was released on a promo cassette with British magazine Vox. It is unclear if other tracks were recorded during that session. \n\nTrack list \n\nOn May 23, 1993, The Cranberries recorded an acoustic performance for the 2 Meter Sessions in the Netherlands. This session was performed live without an audience.\nTrack list\n\nOn the day of their Los Angeles debut, the band was invited at KCRW’s Morning Becomes Eclectic radio show on July 15, 1993 for an interview with host Chris Douridas and a live acoustic performance. The acoustic version of Sunday from that performance was included on the KCRW 1995 compilation \"Rare on Air, volume 2\". The interview and performance are available in streaming mode on the radio's website.\n\nTrack list\n\nIn 1993, The Cranberries recorded a live acoustic performance in Los Angeles for the On the Edge show on the Westwood One radio network. \"How\", \"Away\" and \"Linger\" were broadcast on the week of September 11, 1993 along with two short interview segments. The complete performance was aired during the week of June 4, 1994, without the interview segments.\n\nTrack list\n\nOn March 24, 1999, The Cranberries gave a three-song performance at BBC Radio 1, before the release of their fourth album \"Bury The Hatchet\" on the Mid Morning Show with Simon Mayo. It was the first time the band played \"Animal Instinct\" and Elvis Presley's \"In The Ghetto\".\nTrack list\n\nOn August 16, 2001, The Cranberries gave a two-song acoustic performance at the Studio C of Boulder (Colorado) radio station KBCO – World Class Rock, to promote the upcoming release of \"Wake Up and Smell the Coffee\". A similar performance was broadcast on Minneapolis-based radio station KTCZ – Cities 97 on August 20, 2001.

The two stations are part of the Clear Channel Communications group.\nTrack list\n\nOn September 6, 2002 Irish radio RTÉ 2fm broadcast a live and acoustic session with The Cranberries to promote the release of their greatest hits compilation, \"\". The band discussed each song with radio host Gerry Ryan before performing it.\nTrack list\n\nOn May 3, 1993, the band performed a live set for the \"C'est Lenoir\" show on France Inter in Paris (France). The Black Sessions were recorded in front of an audience.\n\nTrack list\n\nOn August 19, 1994, the band recorded a live acoustic performance in front of an audience for the WNNX radio station in Atlanta, Georgia. The recording was featured on the unauthorized bootleg CD entitled \"Strange Fruits\".\n\nTrack list\n\nOn January 31, 1995, The Cranberries recorded a live acoustic performance in front of an audience at Los 40 Principales in Madrid, Spain.

During that performance with a strings ensemble, the band played nine songs, from which three were unreleased material at that time. While \"Free to Decide\" and \"I’m Still Remembering\" were later included on the band’s third album \"To the Faithful Departed\", \"Yesterday’s Gone\" remains unreleased in a studio format. The MTV Unplugged version of \"Zombie\" appeared on the band’s \"When You're Gone\" North American Maxi single and the one of \"Yesterday's Gone\", on the \"Beneath the Skin – Live in Paris\" DVD.

In this post harvest festival, they give thanks to Misi Saljong (also known as \"Pattigipa Ra'rongipa\"), the sun god, for blessing the people with a rich harvest. Wangala is celebrated in the months from September to December, with different villages setting different dates for the occasion.\n\nThe first Hundred Drums Wangala Festival was organized on December 6 and 7, 1976 at Asanang, near the Rongram C&RD Block Office, 18 km from Tura, India. Since then, it has been celebrated every year. The festival has grown so big as to include dance troupes from outside Garo Hills such as Bangladesh and Karbi Anglong, with a sizeable amount of prize money up for grabs awarded to the best performing dance troupe. The 100 Drums Festival is a state sponsored event, attracting many local, national and international tourists every year.\n\nWangala is traditionally celebrated for two to three days - or up to a week - by two or three collaborating villages; though recently it has been celebrated for one day in metropolitan areas as an attempt to conserve the ancient heritage of the Garo tribe and to expose the younger generation to their roots. True traditional styles of celebrating Wangala can be found in remote \"Songsarek\" (animistic) villages such as Sadolpara in West Garo Hills district of Meghalaya, where people who worship the old gods still persist in their way of life; all the while rejecting Christianity. A much more hyped and commercialised variant of Wangala can be observed in the 100 Drums Festival held at\nAsanang in West Garo Hills, Meghalaya, where performers (who may or may not be Christians and not Songsarek) are invited from all over Garo Hills, and even from far off places such as Karbi Anglong, Tripura and Bangladesh which have sizeable pockets of Garo inhabitants. This mega event is held for three days and is a host to various fan favourites such as sports, food, art and culture. Tura, the cultural, financial and de facto political heartland of the Garos, is mainly represented by the students of Christian Girls' Higher Secondary School, Tura (which teaches the dance to its students as an essential part of the curriculum) at every 100 Drums Festival.\n\n\"Rugala\" (lit. The Pouring of rice beer) and \"Cha·chat So·a\" (lit. Incense burning) are the rituals performed on the first day by the priest, who is known as \"Kamal\". These rituals are performed inside the house of the \"Nokma\" (chieftain i.e. the husband of the woman who holds power over an a'king) of the village. \"Dama Gogata\", the dance with drums, flutes and assorted brass instruments by men and women in colourful dresses and proud headgear - a picture which is synonymous with visuals of Wangala - is performed on the last day of the days-long celebration.\n\nDuring Wangala, people young and old dress in their colourful garments (\"Dakmanda\", Daksari\", or \"Gando\") and feathered headgear (\"do'me\") and dance to music played on long, oval-shaped drums (\"Dama\").\n\n\"Katta Doka\" (talking in a singing style/traditional tribal rapping), \"Ajia\", \"Dani Doka\" (describing Wangala by singing), \"Chambil Mesaa\" or the Pomelo Dance are performed during these days.\n\n\n"}

The purpose of these diaries is to both record information which can later be used by the military to improve its training and tactics as well as to generate a detailed record of units' activities for future use by historians. War diaries are focused on the administration and operations of the unit they cover, and generally do not contain information about individual personnel.\n\nWar diaries were invented by the Prussian Army. On 22 April 1850, the Prussian Minister of War, August von Stockhausen, ordered that all commanders of major units should keep war diaries. All significant military actions, relocations, important messages and orders, casualties, material losses, reinforcements etc. were to be recorded. Subsequent regulations of 1870, 1895, 1916 and 1940 were largely identical to the 1850 regulations.\n\nThe British Army first required that its units keep war diaries in 1907 as a means of preventing its mistakes of the Second Boer War from being repeated, and units currently operating in Afghanistan continue to maintain such diaries. The war diaries kept by Australian military units are normally maintained by the unit's adjutant or intelligence officer and contain a regularly updated narrative of its activities as well as copies of reports, messages received and maps.\nWWII \"War Diaries\" from units of the US Navy (including all ships) and Marine Corps were declassified on December 31, 2012 by the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OCNO) and made available to the public through the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). These \"war diaries\" are part of a larger collection of records from the OCNO at NARA, currently spanning 1875 to 2006.\n\n\n\n"}

His family was Jewish, and originated in Romania on his father's side. Safire later added the \"e\" to his surname for pronunciation reasons, though some of his relatives continue to use the original spelling.\n\nSafire graduated from the Bronx High School of Science, a specialized public high school in New York City. He attended Syracuse University but dropped out after two years. He delivered the commencement address at Syracuse in 1978 and 1990, and became a trustee of the university.\n\nHe was a public relations executive from 1955 to 1960. Previously, he had been a radio and television producer and an Army correspondent. He worked as a publicist for a homebuilder who exhibited a model home at an American trade fair at Sokolniki Park in Moscow in 1959—the one in which Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev had their famous Kitchen Debate. A widely circulated black-and-white photograph of the event was taken by Safire. Safire joined Nixon's campaign for the 1960 Presidential race, and again in 1968. After Nixon's 1968 victory, Safire served as a speechwriter for him and for Spiro Agnew; he is well known for having created Agnew's famous term, \"nattering nabobs of negativism.\"\nSafire prepared a speech called \"In Event of Moon Disaster\" for President Nixon to read on television if the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon. According to the plans, Mission Control would \"close down communications\" with the LEM and a clergyman would have commended their souls to \"the deepest of the deep\" in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. Presidential telephone calls to the astronauts' wives were also planned. The speech originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon's chief of staff H. R. Haldeman in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke's First World War poem \"The Soldier\". In a 2013 piece for \"Foreign Policy\" magazine, Joshua Keating included the speech as one of six entries in a list of \"The Greatest Doomsday Speeches Never Made.\"\n\nHe joined \"The New York Times\" as a political columnist in 1973. Soon after joining the \"Times\", Safire learned that he had been the target of \"national security\" wiretaps authorized by Nixon, and, after noting that he had worked only on domestic matters, wrote with what he characterized as \"restrained fury\" that he had not worked for Nixon through a difficult decade \"to have him—or some lizard-lidded paranoid acting without his approval—eavesdropping on my conversations.\"\n\nIn 1978, Safire won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary on Bert Lance's alleged budgetary irregularities; in 1981, Lance was acquitted by a jury on all nine charges. Safire's column on October 27, 1980, entitled \"The Ayatollah Votes\", was quoted in a campaign ad for Ronald Reagan in that year's presidential election.\n\nSafire also frequently appeared on the NBC's \"Meet the Press\".\n\nUpon announcing the retirement of Safire's political column in 2005, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of \"The New York Times\", said:\"The New York Times\" without Bill Safire is all but unimaginable, Bill's provocative and insightful commentary has held our readers captive since he first graced our Op-Ed Page in 1973. Reaching for his column became a critical and enjoyable part of the day for our readers across the country and around the world. Whether you agreed with him or not was never the point, his writing is delightful, informed and engaging.\n\nSafire served as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board from 1995 to 2004. After ending his op-ed column, he became the full-time chief executive of the Dana Foundation, where he was chairman from 2000. In 2006, Safire was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush.\n\nPortions of Safire's FBI file were released in 2010. The documents \"detail wiretapping ordered by the Nixon administration, including the tapping of Safire's phone.\"\n\nIn addition to his political columns, Safire wrote a column, \"On Language\", in the weekly \"The New York Times Magazine\" from 1979 until the month of his death. Many of the columns were collected in books. According to the linguist Geoffrey Pullum, over the years Safire became less of a \"grammar-nitpicker,\" and Benjamin Zimmer cited Safire's willingness to learn from descriptive linguists. Another book on language was \"The New Language of Politics\" (1968), which developed into what Zimmer called Safire's \"magnum opus,\" \"Safire's Political Dictionary\".\n\nSafire described himself as a \"libertarian conservative.\" A \"Washington Post\" story on the ending of his op-ed column quotes him on the subject:I'm willing to zap conservatives when they do things that are not libertarian. [After the 9/11 attacks,] I was the first to really go after George W. on his treatment of prisoners.\n\nAfter voting for Bill Clinton in 1992, Safire became one of the leading critics of Clinton's administration. Hillary Clinton in particular was often the target of his ire. He caused controversy in a January 8, 1996, essay when, after reviewing her record, he concluded she was a \"congenital liar\". She did not respond to the specific instances cited, but said that she didn't feel offended for herself, but for her mother's sake. According to the president's press secretary at the time, Mike McCurry, \"the President, if he were not the President, would have delivered a more forceful response to that on the bridge of Mr. Safire's nose\".\n\nSafire was one of several voices who called for war with Iraq, and predicted a \"quick war\" and wrote: \"Iraqis, cheering their liberators, will lead the Arab world toward democracy.\" He consistently brought up the point in his \"Times\" columns that an Iraqi intelligence agent met with Mohamed Atta, one of the 9/11 attackers, in Prague, which he called an \"undisputed fact\", a theory which was disputed by the CIA and other intelligence agencies. Safire insisted that the theory was true and used it to make a case for war against Iraq. He also incorrectly predicted that \"freed scientists\" would lead coalition forces to \"caches [of weapons of mass destruction] no inspectors could find\".\n\nSafire was staunchly pro-Israel. He received the Guardian of Zion Award of Bar-Ilan University in 2005. President George W. Bush appointed him to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008.\n\nSafire died from pancreatic cancer at a hospice in Rockville, Maryland, on September 27, 2009, aged 79. He was survived by his wife, Helene Belmar (Julius); their children, Mark and Annabel; and granddaughter, Lily.\n\nThe following is a partial list of his writings:\n\nLanguage\n\nNovels\n\nEdited collections\n\nPolitical works\n\nSpeeches\n\n\n"}
