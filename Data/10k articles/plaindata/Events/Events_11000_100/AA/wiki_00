It was centred in Kosovo and Belgrade (both then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia). A Muslim pilgrim had contracted the smallpox virus in the Middle East. Upon returning to his home in Kosovo, he started the epidemic in which 175 people were infected, 35 of whom died. The epidemic was efficiently contained by enforced quarantine and mass vaccination. The 1982 film \"Variola Vera\" is based on the event.\n\nBy 1972, vaccination for smallpox had long been widely available and the disease was considered to be eradicated in Europe. The population of Yugoslavia had been regularly vaccinated against smallpox for 50 years, and the last case was reported in 1930. This was the major cause for the initial slow reaction by doctors, who did not promptly recognize the symptoms of the disease.\n\nIn October 1970, an Afghan family went on pilgrimage from Afghanistan, where smallpox was endemic, to Mashhad in Iran, triggering a massive epidemic of smallpox in Iran that would last until September 1972. By late 1971, smallpox-infected devotees on pilgrimage had carried the smallpox from Iran into Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn early 1972, a 38-year-old Kosovo Albanian Muslim clergyman named Ibrahim Hoti, from Damnjane near Đakovica, Kosovo, Serbia, undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca. He also visited holy sites in Iraq, where there were known cases of smallpox. He returned home on February 15. The following morning he felt achy and tired, but attributed this to the long bus journey. Hoti soon realised that he had some kind of infection, but, after feeling feverish for a couple of days and developing a rash, he recovered - probably because he had been vaccinated two months earlier.\n\nOn March 3, Latif Mumdžić, a thirty-year-old schoolteacher, who had just arrived in Đakovica to enroll at the local higher institute of education, fell ill. He had no known direct contacts with the clergyman, so he might have been infected by one of the clergyman's friends or relatives who visited him during his illness, or by passing the clergyman in the street.\n\nWhen Mumdžić visited the local medical center two days later, the doctors tried to treat his fever with penicillin (smallpox is a virus, so this was ineffective). His condition did not improve, and after a couple of days his brother took him to the hospital in Čačak, 150 km to the north in Serbia. The doctors there could not help him, so he was transferred by ambulance to the central hospital in Belgrade.\n\nOn March 9, Mumdžić was shown to medical students and staff as a case of an atypical reaction to penicillin, which was a plausible explanation for his condition. On the following day, Mumdžić suffered massive internal bleeding and, despite efforts to save his life, died in the evening.\n\nThe cause of death was listed as \"reaction to penicillin\". In fact he had contracted \"black pox\", a highly contagious form of smallpox. Before his death, Mumdžić directly infected 38 people (including nine doctors and nurses), eight of whom would consequently die.\n\nA few days after Mumdžić's death, a wave of 140 smallpox cases erupted across Kosovo province.\n\nThe government's reaction was swift. Martial law was declared on March 16. Measures included \"cordons sanitaires\" of villages and neighbourhoods, roadblocks, prohibition of public meetings, closure of borders and prohibition of all non-essential travel. Hotels were requisitioned for quarantines in which 10,000 people who may have been in contact with the virus were held under guard by the army. \n\nMumdžić's brother developed a smallpox rash on March 20, resulting in medical authorities realising that Mumdžić had died of smallpox. The authorities undertook a massive revaccination of the population, helped by the World Health Organization (WHO), \"...almost the entire Yugoslavian population of 18 million people was vaccinated.\" Leading experts on smallpox were flown in to help, including Donald Henderson and Don Francis.\n\nWithin two weeks, almost the entire population had been re-vaccinated. By mid-May the spread of the disease was stopped and the country returned to normal life. During the epidemic, 175 people contracted smallpox and 35 of them died.\n\nThe Yugoslav government received international praise for the successful containment of the epidemic, which was also one of the finest hours for Donald Henderson and the WHO, as well as one of the crucial steps in the eradication of smallpox.\n\nIn 1982, Serbian director Goran Marković made the film \"Variola Vera\" about a hospital under quarantine during the epidemic. In 2002, the BBC screened a television drama called \"Smallpox 2002\", which was partly inspired by the events.\n\n\n\n"}

The case is officially called \"State vs. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and others\", but is popularly known as \"Agartala Shoŗojontro Mamla\" (Agartala conspiracy case) as the main conspiracy was purported to have taken place in the Indian city of Agartala in Tripura state, where Sheikh Mujib's associates met Indian military officials.\n\nThe government of Pakistan brought charges against 35 political personalities including three eminent civil servants officials under civil law. They were Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Ahmed Fazlur Rahman CSP, Steward Mujibur Rahman, Commander Moazzem Hossain, former LS Sultanuddin Ahmad, LSCDI Nur Mohammad, Flight Sergeant Mahfiz Ullah, Corporal Abdus Samad, former Havildar Dalil Uddin, Ruhul Quddus CSP, Flight Sergeant Md. Fazlul Haq, Bibhuti Bhushan Chowdhury alias Manik Chowdhury, Bidhan Krishna Sen, Subedar Abdur Razzaque, former clerk Mujibur Rahman, former Flight Sergeant Md. Abdur Razzaque, Sergeant Zahurul Haq, Benedict Dias, A.B. Khurshid, Khan Mohammad Shamsur Rahman CSP, AKM Shamsul Haque, Havildar Azizul Haq, Mahfuzul Bari, Sergeant Shamsul Haq, Shamsul Alam, Captain Mohammad Abdul Muttalib, 21 Baluch Regiment, Captain Shawkat Ali, Captain Khondkar Nazmul Huda, Captain A.N.M Nuruzzaman, Sergeant Abdul Jalil, Mahbub Uddin Chowdhury, Lt. M Rahman, former Subedar Tajul Islam, Ali Reza, Captain Khurshid Uddeen Ahmed, Master Warrant Officer Abdul Latif Majumdar, and Lt. Abdur Rauf.\n\nThe plot was conceived by Sheikh Mujib in an attempt to ignite an armed revolution against West Pakistan that would result in the secession. Two of the accused, navy steward Mujibur Rahman and the educationist Mohammad Ali Reza went to Agartala, Tripura, a city in Eastern India to seek Indian support for an independent Bangladesh.\n\nThe alleged conspiracy was uncovered by the Lieutenant Colonel Shamsul Alam, who commanded the East Pakistan Detachment of the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). It was during this time that an officer of the East Bengal Regiment, Rauf ur Rahman, who was in league with the conspirators made an attempt on Alam's life. Alam displayed great bravery and chased the would-be assassins; for this Alam was awarded the Sitara-e-Basalat, the highest award for bravery in action during peacetime.\n\nIn all, 1,500 Bengalis were arrested in connection with the plot in 1967. In January 1968 the Home Department of Pakistan declared that it had detected a scheme to destabilise Pakistan and break the Eastern wing through an armed revolt, and had arrested 8 people. Later on 18 January, the Department implicated Sheikh Mujib as well. He and others were arrested on 9 May 1968, and were subsequently released, only to be arrested later.\n\nThe existence of a conspiracy between Mujib and India for the secession of East Pakistan has not been proven but it is now known that Mujib did secretly meet Indian officials in Agartala in July 1962 and there were secret meetings between the Awami League and Indian Government representatives after the 1965 war.\n\nPakistan decided to try the accused by court-martial since a lot of the accused involved military personnel. However, this was overturned in favour of a civil trial to implicate the politicians ahead of the 1970 elections as well as to provide transparency of the trials. Hence, only 35 were finally accused. The accused were then moved from Dhaka Central Jail to the secured borders of the Dhaka Cantonment.\n\nThe penal codes were amended to benefit the prosecution of the accused, and the trial began on 19 June 1968 under a special tribunal. The hearings took place inside a secured chamber within the Dhaka Cantonment. The hearing became for Mujib an opportunity to publicise the Awami League demands. The charge sheet of 100 paragraphs were presented before the tribunal, with 227 witnesses and 7 approvers.\n\nThe tribunal was headed by 3 judges – the chair, Justice SA Rahman was a non-Bengali; the other members MR Khan and Maksum-ul-Hakim were Bengalis. The government was represented by the Attorney General TH Khan and former Foreign Minister Manzur Quader. Thomas Williams, a British lawyer, along with local attorneys challenged the formation of the tribunal by filing a petition in favour of Sheikh Mujib. The approvers appeared in the witness box and testified that they provided false evidence under the coercion of the State.\n\nMembers of public looked at the case as a conspiracy of the Pakistan government against the political autonomy movement of East Pakistan, especially since the government was keen to prove that Sheikh Mujib was an Indian agent and a separatist. They organised mass movement and demanded immediate withdrawal of the case and release of all prisoners. According to the government decision, the final date for the case was 6 February 1969. However, because of the mass upsurge of 1969, the government had to defer the date.\n\nIn the morning of 15 February 1969, a Pakistani habildar shot point blank at Sergeant Zahurul Haq at the door of his jail cell, and killed him. The news of the killing led a furious mob to set fire to the State Guest House and other government buildings, where the chief lawyer for the government and the Chair of the tribunal resided. They vacated secretly. Some of the case files and evidence got burnt as a result of the arson.\n\nIn the face of mass movement, the government withdrew the Agartala Conspiracy Case on 22 February 1969. The accused were released on the following day and the Race course Maidan saw a grand reception of the accused, where Sheikh Mujib was given his famous title \"Bangabandhu\".\n\nAngry protesters formed an action committee. This popular hostility forced Aub Khan to withdraw the case and convene a Round Table Conference which Sheikh Mujib triumphantly attended but walked out of when his Six-Point demands were ignored. The case and the resulting uprising was a major factor in the fall of Ayub Khan's government and is also seen as one of the major events leading to \"Bengali nationalism\" and the Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\nSergeant Zahurul Haq were honoured by the naming of a students' residential hall of the University of Dhaka after him.\n\nIn 2010, and on the anniversary of the withdrawal on 22 February 2011, surviving conspirator and Deputy Speaker of the Parliament Shawkat Ali confessed to the parliament at a point of order that the charges read out to them were accurate, stating that they formed a \"Shangram Parishad\" (Action Committee) under Sheikh Mujib for the secession of East Pakistan.\n\nParliamentarian Tofael Ahmed added that had the case not been filed, the plot would have culminated in the secession of East Pakistan without bloodshed, and credit the Deputy Speaker for planning the liberation of the nation.\n\n"}

The Act permits studies to be conducted using animals for procedures such as breeding genetically modified animals, medical and veterinary advances, education, environmental toxicology and includes procedures requiring vivisection, if certain criteria are met. Revised legislation came into force on January 1, 2013. The original act related to the 1986 EU Directive 86/609/EEC which was updated and replaced by EU Directive 2010/63/EU\n\nIn 2002, a Government select committee inquiry described the Act as the \"...tightest system of regulation in the world\" in relation to the regulation of using animals for research.\n\nPrior to ASPA, the use of animals in the UK was regulated by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, which enforced a licensing and inspection system for vivisection. Animal cruelty was previously regulated by the Protection of Animals Act 1911 (now largely repealed) and more recently by the Animal Welfare Act 2006, both of which outlaw the causing of \"unnecessary suffering\". Specific exemptions apply to experiments licensed under the 1986 Act.\n\nThe 1986 Act defined \"regulated procedures\" as animal experiments that could potentially cause \"pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm\", to \"protected animals\", which encompassed all living vertebrates other than humans, under the responsibility of humans. A 1993 amendment added a single invertebrate species, the common octopus (\"Octopus vulgaris\"), as a protected animal. The Act applied only to protected animals from halfway through their gestation or incubation periods (for mammals, birds and reptiles) or from when they became capable of independent feeding (for fish, amphibians and, the common octopuses). Primates, cats, dogs and horses had additional protection over other vertebrates under the Act.\n\nRevised legislation came into force on January 1, 2013. The Act has been expanded to protect -\n\nThe definition of regulated procedures was expanded to -\nASPA also regulates the modification of genes in protected animals if this causes the animal pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. Other considerations in the Act include animal sources, housing conditions, identification methods and the humane killing of animals. This legislation is widely regarded as the strictest in the world protecting animals used in research. Those applying for a license must explain why such research cannot be done through non-animal or in-vitro methods. The project must also pass an ethical review panel which aims to decide if the potential benefits outweigh any suffering for the animals involved.\n\nASPA involves three levels of regulation — person, project, and place.\n\nThe 'person' level is achieved by the granting of a \"personal licence\" (PIL, procedure personal licence) to a researcher wishing to carry out regulated procedures on a protected animal. Having undergone a defined sequence of training, a researcher can apply for a PIL permitting specified techniques to be carried out on named species of animals.\n\nThe 'project' level of regulation is governed by the granting of a \"project licence\" (PPL) to a suitably qualified senior researcher. The PPL details the scope of the work to be carried out, the likely benefits that may be realised by the work, and the costs involved in terms of the numbers and types of animals to be used, and the harm that might be caused to the animals. Typically a large and detailed document, the PPL precisely defines which techniques may be applied to particular animals and for what purpose.\n\nFinally, the 'place' where regulated procedures are carried out is controlled by the granting of a \"certificate of designation\" (PCD) to a senior authority figure at the establishment, such as the Registrar or Vice-chancellor of a University, or the Chief executive officer of a commercial company. The PCD details which rooms in the establishment are permitted to be used for certain techniques and species, but may also apply to outdoors areas and even mobile areas (e.g. boats) if this is where the research is to be conducted.\n\nIt is an offence under ASPA to carry out regulated procedures on a protected animal unless authorised by a personal licence, a project licence, and a certificate of designation.\n\nA report by Animal Aid called the Act a \"vivisectors' charter\", alleging that it allows researchers to do as they please and makes them practically immune from prosecution. The report said that licences to perform experiments are obtained on the basis of a \"nod of approval\" from the Home Office Inspectorate, and that the Home Office relies on the researchers' own cost-benefit analysis of the value of the experiment versus the suffering caused. (Note: This document is now dated - several of the bans called for have been enacted)\n\nA 2002 House of Lords select committee inquiry compared the Act to legislation from France, the U.S., and Japan. The report concluded that \"virtually all witnesses agreed that the UK has the tightest system of regulation in the world\" and that it is \"the only country to require an explicit cost/benefit assessment of every application to conduct animal research.\" Note that costs are explicitly in terms of adverse effects on animals, not the financial cost to the experimenters.\n\nIn 2005, Patricia Hewitt, then British Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, called the Act \"[among] the strongest laws in the world to protect animals which are being used for medical research.\"\n\n"}

When Ridwan of Aleppo died in 1113, there was a period of peace, at least for a few years. However, Roger of Salerno, who was ruling Antioch as regent for Bohemond II, did not take advantage of Ridwan's death; likewise, Baldwin II, count of Edessa, and Pons, count of Tripoli, looked after their own interests and did not ally with Roger against Aleppo. In 1115, Roger defeated a Seljuk Turkish invasion force led by Bursuq ibn Bursuq at the Battle of Sarmin.\n\nIn 1117 Aleppo came under the rule of the Artuqid atabeg Ilghazi. In 1118 Roger captured Azaz, which left Aleppo open to attack from the Crusaders; in response, Ilghazi invaded the Principality in 1119. Roger marched out from Artah with Bernard of Valence, the Latin Patriarch of Antioch. Bernard suggested they remain there, as Artah was a well-defended fortress only a short distance away from Antioch, and Ilghazi would not be able to pass if they were stationed there. The Patriarch also advised Roger to call for help from Baldwin, now king of Jerusalem, and Pons, but Roger felt he could not wait for them to arrive.\n\nRoger camped in the pass of Sarmada, while Ilghazi besieged the fort of al-Atharib. A force under Robert of Vieux-Pont set out to break the siege, and Ilghazi feigned a retreat, Robert's men were drawn out from the fort and ambushed.\n\nIlghazi was also waiting for reinforcements from Toghtekin, the Burid emir of Damascus, but he too was tired of waiting. Using little-used paths, his army quickly surrounded Roger's camp during the night of June 27. The prince had recklessly chosen a campsite in a wooded valley with steep sides and few avenues of escape. Roger's army of 700 knights, 500 Armenian cavalry and 3,000 foot soldiers, including turcopoles, hastily formed into five divisions. These drew up in a V-shaped line with the tip farthest from the Muslim battle array. From left to right, the divisions were commanded by Robert of St. Lo, Prince Roger, Guy de Frenelle, Geoffrey the Monk and Peter. Meanwhile, Roger told off a sixth division under Renaud Mansoer to protect the Antiochene rear.\n\nAs the Muslim army waited, the \"qadi\" Abu al-Fadl ibn al-Khashshab, wearing his lawyer's turban but brandishing a lance, rode out in front of the troopers. At first they were incredulous at being harangued by a scholar but at the end of his passionate evocation of the duties and merits of the jihad warrior, according to Kamal ad-Din, the contemporary historian of Aleppo, these hardened professionals wept with emotion and rode into battle.\n\nThat morning, June 28, the battle was begun by an archery duel between the Antiochene infantry, posted in front of the knights, and the Turkish bowmen. The crusader army was at first successful when the right-hand divisions of Peter and Geoffrey the Monk attacked and defeated the Artuqids opposed to them. Guy de Frenelle's center division had some success also, but the battle was soon decided on the left flank. Robert of St. Lo and the Turcopoles were driven back into Roger's division, disrupting it. A north wind blew dust in the faces of the Antioch knights and footmen, confusing them further. Soon, Artuqid flanking forces enveloped the crusaders.\n\nDuring the fighting, Roger was killed by a sword in the face at the foot of the great jewelled cross which had served as his standard. The rest of the army was killed or captured; only two knights survived. Renaud Mansoer, took refuge in the fort of Sarmada to wait for King Baldwin, but was later taken captive by Ilghazi. Among the other prisoners was likely Walter the Chancellor, who later wrote an account of the battle. The massacre led to the name of the battle, \"ager sanguinis\", Latin for \"the field of blood.\"\n\nThe battle proved that the Muslims could defeat a Crusader army without the help of the Seljuks. However, Ilghazi soon went on an alcoholic binge and did not advance to Antioch, where Patriarch Bernard was organizing whatever defense he could. Even so, because of the loss of the Antiochene field army, Atharib, Zerdana, Sarmin, Ma'arrat al-Numan and Kafr Tab rapidly fell into Muslim hands.\n\nIlghazi was defeated by Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Count Pons at the Battle of Hab on August 14, and Baldwin took over the regency of Antioch. Subsequently, Baldwin recovered some of the lost towns. Even so, the defeat at the Field of Blood left Antioch severely weakened, and subject to repeated attacks by the Muslims in the following decade. Eventually, the Principality came under the influence of a resurgent Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe Crusaders regained some of their influence in Syria at the Battle of Azaz six years later in 1125.\n\nThe description \"ager sanguinis\" is possibly a Biblical reference to the field purchased by Judas with the money he had been given to betray Christ. The Acts of the Apostles records that Judas killed himself in the field, and it was thus known as \"acheldemach\" in Aramaic, and \"ager sanguinis\" in the Vulgate.\nThe Turks captured 70 knights and 500 soldiers of inferior rank. The high-ranking prisoners were ransomed and 30 men who could not pay their way out were executed.\n\n"}
{"id": "16605457", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16605457", "title": "Battle of the Persian Border", "text": "Battle of the Persian Border\n\nThe Battle of the Persian Border was the second encounter between the forces of Media and Persia. Though not a decisive victory for Persia, it signaled the diminishing power of Media in Southwest Asia. It was the first battle Cambyses I had fought in, and the first which he had fought with his son, Cyrus the Great. The first major battle, which lasted two days, was an attempt to bring freedom to Persia. It also prompted the Persians to retire south, and fight a third battle. It was narrated by Nicolaus of Damascus, and among others who also mentioned the Battle of Hyrba, but Herodotus does not mention this battle. Most historians on the battle consider Herodotus to be mentioning only the first and last battles in the war, which is partly based on the description of his two battles. At the border this became the first major battle between the two powers. Cyrus managed to escape the enemy without retreating, thus ending the battle and prolonging the struggle without a complete victory for Astyages, the king of the Medes. The next battle became the last stand for the Persians; as their very existence relied on the outcome of the war, which had to be won.\n\nCyrus had retired to the border of the Median province to protect the Persian border against Astyages. After the Battle of Hyrba Astyages invaded Persia. The battle that was to come was composed of cavalry from both sides, and chariots that in most part were used for the battle, for they were never used again. A small part of the invasion force from the Medes participated in the battle, while the Persians spent all their cavalry from their reserves. Astyages had tried to persuade Cyrus to surrender but he now preferred to show no mercy even though he had better relations with Atradates (the variant name of Herodotus' Mitradates, which Nicolaus mistakenly uses for Cambyses, the father of Cyrus). The name of the city Cyrus and his father were protecting was not given. Nevertheless, the city was an important frontier town worth the protection. When Astyages came within reach of the city, Persian civilians were ready to evacuate if necessary. Meanwhile, Cyrus and Cambyses assembled the army, but it is not exactly known whether Oebares (who helped Cyrus to the throne) or Harpagus participated on the side of Cyrus in the battle, it is known that the original Oebares was an advisor to Cyrus. So Nicolaus, as he is known to change names around, may most likely be saying Harpagus was in the battle, as he was historically Cyrus's second in command and the only other choice available, but in this battle it seems Oebares was on Cyrus' side. Then it could also be said as Herodotus mentions, Harpagus was the most likely candidate that was in this battle that occurred about a year after the first battle. Therefore, as battle began, Astyages had his special troops positioned to attack at the rear.\n\nAfter the first days battle the Persians had either inflicted massive casualties on Astyages' personal guard that was made up of cavalry, or the rest of his army that was also cavalry. Nevertheless, the Persians still claimed victory the first day. The second day of the battle Cyrus, assuming the battle had ended, secretly retired south with the rest of the armed forces, while only Cambyses and a few old men remained in the city. When Cyrus was forced to fight again, Astyages' ingenious move of cavalry occurred, which was aimed at capturing the poorly guarded city. As he was assuming the battle had not ended, he easily captured the city, while only Cambyses is reported to have been wounded and later died. It is debated among today's historians if the second day is to be counted as part of the original battle, or that it should be counted as a separate battle. As the Persians retired south, Astyages readily abandoned the city, which is based partly on the scant sources from Nicolaus, therefore not becoming a complete victory for Astyages, as he is not known to put a garrison there after he and his forces went south after the Persians. It was however a psychological blow to the Medes as they thought the Persians were lucky in the first battle, but again the Persians won, this time tactically. Both armies later went back to their camps and organized their armies while deciding where to meet for the next fight. Then as the year passed, both forces agreed to meet at the Persian capital which Astyages wished to capture.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "490608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=490608", "title": "Bon Festival", "text": "Bon Festival\n\nThe festival of Obon lasts for three days; however its starting date varies within different regions of Japan. When the lunar calendar was changed to the Gregorian calendar at the beginning of the Meiji era, the localities in Japan reacted differently and this resulted in three different times of Obon. \"Shichigatsu Bon\" (\"Bon in July\") is based on the solar calendar and is celebrated around 15 July in eastern Japan (Kantō region such as Tokyo, Yokohama and the Tōhoku region), coinciding with Chūgen. \"Hachigatsu Bon\" (Bon in August) is based on the lunar calendar, is celebrated around the 15th of August and is the most commonly celebrated time. \"Kyū Bon\" (Old Bon) is celebrated on the 15th day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, and so differs each year. \"Kyū Bon\" is celebrated in areas like the northern part of the Kantō region, Chūgoku region, Shikoku, and the Okinawa Prefecture. These three days are not listed as public holidays but it is customary that people are given leave.\n\n\"Obon\" is a shortened form of \"Ullambana\" ( or , \"urabon'e\"). It is Sanskrit for \"hanging upside down\" and implies great suffering. The Japanese believe they should ameliorate the suffering of the \"Urabanna\".\n\n\"Bon Odori\" originates from the story of Maha Maudgalyayana (Mokuren), a disciple of the Buddha, who used his supernatural powers to look upon his deceased mother. He discovered she had fallen into the Realm of Hungry Ghosts and was suffering. Greatly disturbed, he went to the Buddha and asked how he could release his mother from this realm. Buddha instructed him to make offerings to the many Buddhist monks who had just completed their summer retreat, on the fifteenth day of the seventh month. The disciple did this and, thus, saw his mother's release. He also began to see the true nature of her past selflessness and the many sacrifices that she had made for him. The disciple, happy because of his mother's release and grateful for his mother's kindness, danced with joy. From this dance of joy comes Bon Odori or \"Bon Dance\", a time in which ancestors and their sacrifices are remembered and appreciated. See also: Ullambana Sutra.\n\nAs Obon occurs in the heat of the summer, participants traditionally wear yukata, or light cotton kimonos. Many Obon celebrations include a huge carnival with rides, games, and summer festival food like watermelon.\n\nFamilies sent their ancestors' spirits back to their permanent dwelling place under the guidance of fire: this rite was known as sending fire (Okuribi). Fire also marks the commencement (Mukaebi) as well as the closing of the festival.\n\n\"Bon Odori\" (Japanese: ), meaning simply \"Bon dance\", is a style of dancing performed during Obon. Originally a Nenbutsu folk dance to welcome the spirits of the dead, the style of celebration varies in many aspects from region to region. Each region has a local dance, as well as different music. The music can be songs specifically pertinent to the spiritual message of Obon, or local min'yō folk songs. Consequently, the Bon dance will look and sound different from region to region. Hokkaidō is known for a folk-song known as \"Sōran Bushi\". The song \"Tokyo Ondo\" takes its namesake from the capital of Japan. \"Gujo Odori\" in Gujō in Gifu Prefecture is famous for all night dancing. \"Gōshū Ondo\" is a folk song from Shiga Prefecture. Residents of the Kansai area will recognize the famous \"Kawachi ondo\". Tokushima in Shikoku is very famous for its \"Awa Odori\", and in the far south, one can hear the \"Ohara Bushi\" of Kagoshima.\n\nThe way in which the dance is performed is also different in each region, though the typical Bon dance involves people lining up in a circle around a high wooden scaffold made especially for the festival called a \"yagura\". The yagura is usually also the bandstand for the musicians and singers of the Obon music. Some dances proceed clockwise, and some dances proceed counter-clockwise around the yagura. Some dances reverse during the dance, though most do not. At times, people face the yagura and move towards and away from it. Still some dances, such as the Kagoshima Ohara dance, and the Tokushima Awa Odori, simply proceed in a straight line through the streets of the town.\n\nThe dance of a region can depict the area's history and specialization. For example, the movements of the dance of the Tankō Bushi (the \"coal mining song\") of old Miike Mine in Kyushu show the movements of miners, i.e. digging, cart pushing, lantern hanging, etc.; the above-mentioned Soran Bushi mimics the work of fishermen such as hauling in the nets. All dancers perform the same dance sequence in unison.\n\nThere are other ways in which a regional Bon dance can vary. Some dances involve the use of different kinds of fans, others involve the use of small towels called \"tenugui\" which may have colorful designs. Some require the use of small wooden clappers, or \"kachi-kachi\" during the dance. The \"Hanagasa Odori\" of Yamagata is performed with a straw hat that has been decorated with flowers.\n\nThe music that is played during the Bon dance is not limited to Obon music and min'yō; some modern enka hits and kids' tunes written to the beat of the \"ondo\" are also used to dance to during Obon season.\n\nThe Bon dance tradition is said to have started in the later years of the Muromachi period as a public entertainment. In the course of time, the original religious meaning has faded, and the dance has become associated with summer.\n\nThe Bon dance performed in the Okinawa Islands is known as \"eisā\". Similarly, the Yaeyama Islands have \"Angama\".\n\nIn Argentina, the Bon Festival is celebrated by Japanese communities during the summer of the southern hemisphere. The biggest festival is held in Colonia Urquiza, in La Plata. It takes place on the sports ground of the La Plata Japanese School. The festival also includes \"taiko\" shows and typical dances.\n\nBon Odori Festival is celebrated every year in many Japanese communities all over Brazil, as Brazil is home to the largest Japanese population outside Japan. São Paulo is the main city of the Japanese community in Brazil, and also features the major festival in Brazil, with street odori dancing and matsuri dance. It also features Taiko and Shamisen contests. And of course, this festival is also a unique experience of a variety of Japanese food & drinks, art and dance.\n\nThe Korean version of the Bon celebration is known as Baekjung. Participants present offerings at Buddhist shrines and temples, and masked dances are performed. It is as much an agricultural festival as a religious one.\n\nIn Malaysia, Bon Odori Festivals are also celebrated every year in Esplanade (Padang Kota Lama) Penang, Matsushita Corp Stadium in Shah Alam, Selangor, and also Universiti Malaysia Sabah at Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. This celebration, which is a major attraction for the state of Selangor, is the brain child of the Japanese Expatriate & Immigrant's Society in Malaysia. In comparison to the celebrations in Japan, the festival is celebrated on a much smaller scale in Penang, Selangor and Sabah, and is less associated with Buddhism and more with Japanese culture. Held mainly to expose locals to a part of Japanese culture, the festival provides the experience of a variety of Japanese food and drinks, art and dance, with the vast number of Japanese companies in Malaysia taking part to promote their products.\n\nBon Odori festivals are also celebrated in North America, particularly by Japanese-Americans or Japanese-Canadians affiliated with Buddhist temples and organizations. Buddhist Churches of America (BCA) temples in the U.S. typically celebrate Bon Odori with both religious Obon observances and traditional Bon Odori dancing around a yagura. Many temples also concurrently hold a cultural and food bazaar providing a variety of cuisine and art, also to display features of Japanese culture and Japanese-American history. Performances of taiko by both amateur and professional groups have recently become a popular feature of Bon Odori festivals. Bon Odori festivals are usually scheduled anytime between July and September.\nBon Odori melodies are also similar to those in Japan; for example, the dance Tankō Bushi from Kyushu is also performed in the U.S. In California, due to the diffusion of Japanese immigration, Bon Odori dances also differ from Northern to Southern California, and some are influenced by American culture, such as \"Baseball Ondo\".\nThe \"Bon season\" is an important part of the present-day culture and life of Hawaii. It was brought there by the plantation workers from Japan, and now the bon dance events are held among the five major islands (Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui and Hawaii) on weekend evenings from June to August. They are held usually at Buddhist missions, but sometimes at Shintoist missions or at shopping centers. At some Buddhist missions, the dance is preceded by a simple ritual where the families of the deceased in the past year burn incense for remembrance, but otherwise the event is non-religious. The songs played differ among the regions --- one or two hour bon dance in the western part of the Big Island (in and around Kailua Kona), for example, typically starts with \"Tankō Bushi\", continues with songs such as \"Kawachi Otoko Bushi\" (using wooden clappers), \"Yukata Odori\" (using the towels given at the donation desk), \"Asatoya Yunta\" and \"Ashibina\" from Okinawa Prefecture (reflecting the fact that many Okinawan descendants live in Hawaii), \"Pokémon Ondo\" for children, zumba songs for the young, \"Beautiful Sunday\", etc., and ends with \"Fukushima Ondo\" celebrating abundant harvest. The participants, Japanese descendants and the people of all races, dance in a big circle around the yagura, the central tower set up for the dance, from which recorded songs are broadcast and, most of the time, the taiko group accompany the songs playing drums. In larger cities, bon dance lessons are given by volunteers before the actual events. \n\nSome Japanese museums may also hold Obon festivals, such as the Morikami Japanese Museum in Florida.\n\nIn St. Louis Missouri the Botanical Garden has hosted a Bon festival over Labor Day weekend every year since 1977. Known as the Japanese festival it is a collaboration with several Japanese-American organizations. Hosting thousands of people over 3 days it provides authentic Japanese music, art, dance, food, and entertainment including dancing around a yagura, sumo wrestling, Taiko drums, Bonsai demonstrations, music played on traditional instruments, several bazaars, food courts with authentic Japanese foods, tea ceremonies, candlelit lanterns released on the lake in the gardens Japanese garden and much more.\n\nIt is also celebrated in the country of Taiwan, because of their Chinese influence and roots.\n\n\n\n"}

The FBI had reported two weeks after the assassination that Andrews, who had been hospitalized with pneumonia, said he was under heavy sedation and had concluded that the call had been a \"figment of his imagination\".\n\nNearly three years later on March 2, 1967, the New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison asserted that \"Clay Bertrand\" was actually New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw who had conspired with Lee Harvey Oswald and David Ferrie to kill Kennedy. Shaw, who had been arrested and booked with conspiracy to commit murder, denied that he had ever used the name. An FBI document to President Lyndon Johnson's advisor W. Marvin Watson at the time of this development indicated that they had been unable to locate an individual by the name \"Clay Bertrand.\"\n\nShortly after appearing before the Orleans Parish grand jury, Andrews stated in an interview on June 28, 1967 that \"Bertrand\" was not Shaw but was Eugene Davis, his friend and client. Davis denied in an affidavit that he was \"Bertrand\" or the person who suggested that Andrews go to Dallas to help Oswald. Andrews was subsequently convicted on three counts of perjury for lying to the grand jury on August 14, 1967. On February 25, 1969, Andrews testified during the trial of Clay Shaw that the name \"'Clay Bertrand' was a figment of [his] imagination\" and that he had been \"carrying on a farce\" in order to prevent \"bring[ing] a lot of heat and trouble to someone who didn't deserve it.\" On March 1, 1969, the 34-day trial concluded when the jury acquitted Shaw after deliberating less than an hour.\n\n"}

UNITY seeks to provide positive artistic outlets for youth to express themselves instead of expressing themselves through violence, drug use, stereotyping, bullying and other negative forms of self-expression.\n\nThe International Fireworks Festival is held at Elliston Park in Southeast Calgary and is presented by Trico Homes. Each night of the festival showcases a different nation. Participants attend by invitation of the organizers. Pyrotechnic displays take place over Elliston Park and are synchronized to music. Thus, these choreographed pyrotechnical arrangements are referred to as 'pyro-musicals'.\n\nIn 2009 the organizers introduced a variety of artistic requirements that all fireworks designers must incorporate into their designs. In past years the fireworks were presented in the style of a competition with a competitor being limited to winning two years in a row before a mandatory year-long break would be implemented. As of 2009, the pyro-musical presentations have been presented in a festival process rather than as a competition. This new process has been introduced to better meet artistic and funding criteria set forward by various backing partners as well as to help better fulfill GlobalFest's mandate of promoting cultural diversity.\n\nOver the years several countries have participated in the pyro-musical aspect of GlobalFest: Canada, USA, Mexico, India, South Africa, Germany, Portugal, Hong Kong, China, Spain, Italy and Japan.\n\nNew artistic requirements included a compulsory piece of music that must be incorporated by each competitor and a 25% minimum of each competitor's music that must be native to the representing country. This was done to challenge the designers, provide a better pyro-musical experience to the audience, and better meet the mandate of GlobalFest as a Multi-Cultural Festival. From 2012-2017, the compulsory piece was composed by local, Calgarian composer Donovan Seidle.\n\nGlobalfest 2012 featured countries:\n\nGlobalFest 2013 featured countries:\n\n\nGlobalFest 2014 featured countries:\n\nGlobalFest 2015 featured countries:\n\nGlobalFest 2016 featured countries:\n\nGlobalFest 2017 featured PROVINCES (Canada 150 Celebration):\n\nGlobalfest 2018 featured countries:\n\nCompetition winners:\n\n\nIn the early years, GlobalFest featured cultural pavilions scattered throughout Calgary, usually in various community halls. The pavilions would often include ethnic food, displays and entertainment. Cultural Pavilions included themes from Africa, Hispanic America, Middle East, Caribbean, Francophone, India, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Ukraine and Vietnam. The OneWorld festival was originally co-organized with the International Avenue Arts and Culture Centre.\n\nIn 2007, the pavilions were grouped together for the first time at Penbrooke Meadows Community Association and was visited by over 10,000 GlobalFest patrons.\n\nIn 2008, a previously protected area of Elliston Park was opened up to the organizers and the move was made to transfer the cultural pavilions to Elliston Park and re-launch the OneWorld Village. The cultural organizations are also provided the opportunity to present their nations' foods in separate food kiosks, located adjacent to the OneWorld Village.\n\nGlobalFest patrons can now enjoy the OneWorld Festival in conjunction with the International Fireworks Festival each evening at the same location in Elliston Park. Cultural stages will feature music, dance and other artists presented by the cultural pavilion organizers within the OneWorld Village. The Calgary Foundation Centennial stage will also be presenting various artists to those patrons on the south side of Elliston Park. A third stage has been added to the site located in the OneWorld Cafe and International Bar. The Cafe stage will provide entertainment nightly prior to the fireworks as well as for an hour following the fireworks presentation.\n\nThe idea for the festival started in 1994, when the newly established Calgary Fireworks Festival Society started looking for a safe firework launch site. It took until 2001 to discover Elliston Park and its lake. At the same time, the International Avenue Arts and Culture Centre was making plans for a multicultural festival in Forest Lawn. The two non-profit societies presented plans for a joint festival at Calgary's International Avenue Business Revitalisation Zone (a city department), and the festival began in 2003, with an audience of almost 100,000, including city residents and tourists.\n\nThe site chosen for the fireworks display, Elliston Lake, is the second largest lake in Calgary (after Glenmore Reservoir), and was created close to a landfill site in 1978. The land has been owned by the city of Calgary since 1960 The area was used for agriculture for ten years, and Elliston Park opened in 1994. Over the years the park has been expanded by reclaiming land from the nearby landfill, bringing the total area to over 410 hectares, making it the city's second largest park (after Nose Hill).\n\n\n"}

The economic slowdown began in the 1430s in the north of the country, spreading south in the 1440s, with the economy not recovering until the 1480s. The Great Slump took place against a wider trading crisis in Northern Europe, driven by shortages of silver, essential for the money supply, and a breakdown in trade. It was also driven by multiple harvest failures in the 1430s and disease amongst livestock, that drove up the price of food and damaged the wider economy.\n\nThe impact of the Great Slump was far reaching across England. Certain groups were particularly badly affected: cloth exports fell by 35 percent in just four years at the end of the 1440s, for example, collapsing by up to 90 percent in some parts of the South-West. Prices of remaining trade goods fell dramatically as well. Popular rebellions ensued in 1450 under Jack Cade, and the events contributed to the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in the 1460s.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17326228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17326228", "title": "History of structural engineering", "text": "History of structural engineering\n\nThe history of structural engineering dates back to at least 2700 BC when the step pyramid for Pharaoh Djoser was built by Imhotep, the first engineer in history known by name. Pyramids were the most common major structures built by ancient civilizations because it is a structural form which is inherently stable and can be almost infinitely scaled (as opposed to most other structural forms, which cannot be linearly increased in size in proportion to increased loads).\n\nAnother notable engineering feat from antiquity still in use today is the qanat water management system. \nQanat technology developed in the time of the Medes, the predecessors of the Persian Empire (modern-day Iran which has the oldest and longest Qanat (older than 3000 years and longer than 71 km) that also spread to other cultures having had contact with the Persian.\n\nThroughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans, such as stone masons and carpenters, rising to the role of master builder. No theory of structures existed and understanding of how structures stood up was extremely limited, and based almost entirely on empirical evidence of 'what had worked before'. Knowledge was retained by guilds and seldom supplanted by advances. Structures were repetitive, and increases in scale were incremental.\n\nNo record exists of the first calculations of the strength of structural members or the behaviour of structural material, but the profession of structural engineer only really took shape with the Industrial Revolution and the re-invention of concrete (see History of concrete). The physical sciences underlying structural engineering began to be understood in the Renaissance and have been developing ever since.\n\nThe recorded history of structural engineering starts with the ancient Egyptians. In the 27th century BC, Imhotep was the first structural engineer known by name and constructed the first known step pyramid in Egypt. In the 26th century BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza was constructed in Egypt. It remained the largest man-made structure for millennia and was considered an unsurpassed feat in architecture until the 19th century AD.\n\nThe understanding of the physical laws that underpin structural engineering in the Western world dates back to the 3rd century BC, when Archimedes published his work \"On the Equilibrium of Planes\" in two volumes, in which he sets out the \"Law of the Lever\", stating:\n\nArchimedes used the principles derived to calculate the areas and centers of gravity of various geometric figures including triangles, paraboloids, and hemispheres. Archimedes's work on this and his work on calculus and geometry, together with Euclidean geometry, underpin much of the mathematics and understanding of structures in modern structural engineering.\n\nThe ancient Romans made great bounds in structural engineering, pioneering large structures in masonry and concrete, many of which are still standing today. They include aqueducts, thermae, columns, lighthouses, defensive walls and harbours. Their methods are recorded by Vitruvius in his De Architectura written in 25 BC, a manual of civil and structural engineering with extensive sections on materials and machines used in construction. One reason for their success is their accurate surveying techniques based on the dioptra, groma and chorobates.\n\nCenturies later, in the 15th and 16th centuries and despite lacking beam theory and calculus, Leonardo da Vinci produced many engineering designs based on scientific observations and rigour, including a design for a bridge to span the Golden Horn. Though dismissed at the time, the design has since been judged to be both feasible and structurally valid\nThe foundations of modern structural engineering were laid in the 17th century by Galileo Galilei, Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton with the publication of three great scientific works. In 1638 Galileo published \"Dialogues Relating to Two New Sciences\", outlining the sciences of the strength of materials and the motion of objects (essentially defining gravity as a force giving rise to a constant acceleration). It was the first establishment of a scientific approach to structural engineering, including the first attempts to develop a theory for beams. This is also regarded as the beginning of structural analysis, the mathematical representation and design of building structures.\n\nThis was followed in 1676 by Robert Hooke's first statement of Hooke's Law, providing a scientific understanding of elasticity of materials and their behaviour under load.\n\nEleven years later, in 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\", setting out his Laws of Motion, providing for the first time an understanding of the fundamental laws governing structures.\n\nAlso in the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz both independently developed the Fundamental theorem of calculus, providing one of the most important mathematical tools in engineering.\n\nFurther advances in the mathematics needed to allow structural engineers to apply the understanding of structures gained through the work of Galileo, Hooke and Newton during the 17th century came in the 18th century when Leonhard Euler pioneered much of the mathematics and many of the methods which allow structural engineers to model and analyse structures. Specifically, he developed the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation with Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782) circa 1750 - the fundamental theory underlying most structural engineering design.\n\nDaniel Bernoulli, with Johann (Jean) Bernoulli (1667–1748), is also credited with formulating the theory of virtual work, providing a tool using equilibrium of forces and compatibility of geometry to solve structural problems. In 1717 Jean Bernoulli wrote to Pierre Varignon explaining the principle of virtual work, while in 1726 Daniel Bernoulli wrote of the \"composition of forces\".\n\nIn 1757 Leonhard Euler went on to derive the Euler buckling formula, greatly advancing the ability of engineers to design compression elements.\n\nThroughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, materials science and structural analysis underwent development at a tremendous pace.\n\nThough elasticity was understood in theory well before the 19th century, it was not until 1821 that Claude-Louis Navier formulated the general theory of elasticity in a mathematically usable form. In his \"leçons\" of 1826 he explored a great range of different structural theory, and was the first to highlight that the role of a structural engineer is not to understand the final, failed state of a structure, but to prevent that failure in the first place. In 1826 he also established the elastic modulus as a property of materials independent of the second moment of area, allowing engineers for the first time to both understand structural behaviour and structural materials.\n\nTowards the end of the 19th century, in 1873, Carlo Alberto Castigliano presented his dissertation \"Intorno ai sistemi elastici\", which contains his theorem for computing displacement as partial derivative of the strain energy.\n\nIn 1824, Portland cement was patented by the engineer Joseph Aspdin as \"a superior cement resembling Portland Stone\", British Patent no. 5022. Although different forms of cement already existed (Pozzolanic cement was used by the Romans as early as 100 B.C. and even earlier by the ancient Greek and Chinese civilizations) and were in common usage in Europe from the 1750s, the discovery made by Aspdin used commonly available, cheap materials, making concrete construction an economical possibility.\n\nDevelopments in concrete continued with the construction in 1848 of a rowing boat built of ferrocement - the forerunner of modern reinforced concrete - by Joseph-Louis Lambot. He patented his system of mesh reinforcement and concrete in 1855, one year after W.B. Wilkinson also patented a similar system. This was followed in 1867 when a reinforced concrete planting tub was patented by Joseph Monier in Paris, using steel mesh reinforcement similar to that used by Lambot and Wilkinson. Monier took the idea forward, filing several patents for tubs, slabs and beams, leading eventually to the Monier system of reinforced structures, the first use of steel reinforcement bars located in areas of tension in the structure.\n\nSteel construction was first made possible in the 1850s when Henry Bessemer developed the Bessemer process to produce steel. He gained patents for the process in 1855 and 1856 and successfully completed the conversion of cast iron into cast steel in 1858. Eventually mild steel would replace both wrought iron and cast iron as the preferred metal for construction.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, great advancements were made in the use of cast iron, gradually replacing wrought iron as a material of choice. Ditherington Flax Mill in Shrewsbury, designed by Charles Bage, was the first building in the world with an interior iron frame. It was built in 1797. In 1792 William Strutt had attempted to build a fireproof mill at Belper in Derby (Belper West Mill), using cast iron columns and timber beams within the depths of brick arches that formed the floors. The exposed beam soffits were protected against fire by plaster. This mill at Belper was the world's first attempt to construct fireproof buildings, and is the first example of fire engineering. This was later improved upon with the construction of Belper North Mill, a collaboration between Strutt and Bage, which by using a full cast iron frame represented the world's first \"fire proofed\" building.\n\nThe Forth Bridge was built by Benjamin Baker, Sir John Fowler and William Arrol in 1889, using steel, after the original design for the bridge by Thomas Bouch was rejected following the collapse of his Tay Rail Bridge. The Forth Bridge was one of the first major uses of steel, and a landmark in bridge design. Also in 1889, the wrought-iron Eiffel Tower was built by Gustave Eiffel and Maurice Koechlin, demonstrating the potential of construction using iron, despite the fact that steel construction was already being used elsewhere.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Russian structural engineer Vladimir Shukhov developed analysis methods for tensile structures, thin-shell structures, lattice shell structures and new structural geometries such as hyperboloid structures. Pipeline transport was pioneered by Vladimir Shukhov and the Branobel company in the late 19th century.\n\nAgain taking reinforced concrete design forwards, from 1892 onwards François Hennebique's firm used his patented reinforced concrete system to build thousands of structures throughout Europe. Thaddeus Hyatt in the US and Wayss & Freitag in Germany also patented systems. The firm \"AG für Monierbauten\" constructed 200 reinforced concrete bridges in Germany between 1890 and 1897 The great pioneering uses of reinforced concrete however came during the first third of the 20th century, with Robert Maillart and others furthering of the understanding of its behaviour. Maillart noticed that many concrete bridge structures were significantly cracked, and as a result left the cracked areas out of his next bridge design - correctly believing that if the concrete was cracked, it was not contributing to the strength. This resulted in the revolutionary Salginatobel Bridge design. Wilhelm Ritter formulated the truss theory for the shear design of reinforced concrete beams in 1899, and Emil Mörsch improved this in 1902. He went on to demonstrate that treating concrete in compression as a linear-elastic material was a conservative approximation of its behaviour. Concrete design and analysis has been progressing ever since, with the development of analysis methods such as yield line theory, based on plastic analysis of concrete (as opposed to linear-elastic), and many different variations on the model for stress distributions in concrete in compression\n\nPrestressed concrete, pioneered by Eugène Freyssinet with a patent in 1928, gave a novel approach in overcoming the weakness of concrete structures in tension. Freyssinet constructed an experimental prestressed arch in 1908 and later used the technology in a limited form in the Plougastel Bridge in France in 1930. He went on to build six prestressed concrete bridges across the Marne River, firmly establishing the technology.\n\nStructural engineering theory was again advanced in 1930 when Professor Hardy Cross developed his Moment distribution method, allowing the real stresses of many complex structures to be approximated quickly and accurately.\n\nIn the mid 20th century John Fleetwood Baker went on to develop the plasticity theory of structures, providing a powerful tool for the safe design of steel structures. The possibility of creating structures with complex geometries, beyond analysis by hand calculation methods, first arose in 1941 when Alexander Hrennikoff submitted his D.Sc thesis at MIT on the topic of discretization of plane elasticity problems using a lattice framework. This was the forerunner to the development of finite element analysis. In 1942, Richard Courant developed a mathematical basis for finite element analysis. This led in 1956 to the publication by J. Turner, R. W. Clough, H. C. Martin, and L. J. Topp's of a paper on the \"Stiffness and Deflection of Complex Structures\". This paper introduced the name \"finite-element method\" and is widely recognised as the first comprehensive treatment of the method as it is known today.\n\nHigh-rise construction, though possible from the late 19th century onwards, was greatly advanced during the second half of the 20th century. Fazlur Khan designed structural systems that remain fundamental to many modern high rise constructions and which he employed in his structural designs for the John Hancock Center in 1969 and Sears Tower in 1973. Khan's central innovation in skyscraper design and construction was the idea of the \"tube\" and \"bundled tube\" structural systems for tall buildings. He defined the framed tube structure as \"a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube-like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation.\" Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads, for example wind, are supported by the structure as a whole. About half the exterior surface is available for windows. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity. The first building to apply the tube-frame construction was in the DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building which Khan designed in Chicago. This laid the foundations for the tube structures used in most later skyscraper constructions, including the construction of the World Trade Center.\n\nAnother innovation that Fazlur Khan developed was the concept of X-bracing, which reduced the lateral load on the building by transferring the load into the exterior columns. This allowed for a reduced need for interior columns thus creating more floor space, and can be seen in the John Hancock Center. The first sky lobby was also designed by Khan for the John Hancock Center in 1969. Later buildings with sky lobbies include the World Trade Center, Petronas Twin Towers and Taipei 101.\n\nIn 1987 Jörg Schlaich and Kurt Schafer published the culmination of almost ten years of work on the strut and tie method for concrete analysis - a tool to design structures with discontinuities such as corners and joints, providing another powerful tool for the analysis of complex concrete geometries.\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries the development of powerful computers has allowed finite element analysis to become a significant tool for structural analysis and design. The development of finite element programs has led to the ability to accurately predict the stresses in complex structures, and allowed great advances in structural engineering design and architecture. In the 1960s and 70s computational analysis was used in a significant way for the first time on the design of the Sydney Opera House roof. Many modern structures could not be understood and designed without the use of computational analysis.\n\nDevelopments in the understanding of materials and structural behaviour in the latter part of the 20th century have been significant, with detailed understanding being developed of topics such as fracture mechanics, earthquake engineering, composite materials, temperature effects on materials, dynamics and vibration control, fatigue, creep and others. The depth and breadth of knowledge now available in structural engineering, and the increasing range of different structures and the increasing complexity of those structures has led to increasing specialisation of structural engineers.\n\n\n\"World Expos.

The festival features a flagship 50 Hour filmmaking challenge, where participants are given 50 hours to make a film after which a panel of judges select award winners. The competition has run each September since 2011 and is deemed as largest creative collaborative activity. Competitors form teams and are given a common theme to which they then write a script and shoot the films. They have a free choice of locations, equipment and actors. The teams are also responsible for post-production including editing and audio.\n\nFrom 2016, the organizers have added a two day on-ground festival in Mumbai which talks about various aspects of creation across films, digital, literature and music with interesting conversations, workshops and performances. Over 20,000 content enthusiasts attend the festival every year making it one umbrella place for creators.\n\nIndia Film Project (IFP) was started by Ritam Bhatnagar in 2011 as the Ahmedabad Film Project, a competition for local filmmakers. In 2013 it was renamed the India Film Project, admitting entrants from other countries from 2014. The sixth edition held in September 2016 received entries from over 260 cities and 20 countries.\n\nThe first Ahmedabad Film Project in 2011 received 86 entries from 18 cities. Filmmaker Sanjay Gadhvi was the jury member. More than 600 filmmakers participated in the event. The theme for the filmmaking competition was 'Small things in life'. As founder Ritam says, \"The motive of beginning this festival was to attract people towards filmmaking, considered a niche hobby back then\". \"The festival was meant to be a one-time activity, but the response was too good to make it an annual happening\" he adds.\n\nThe 2012 Edition saw more than 1200 filmmakers, 120 teams from 24 cities across India, competing against each other to win the title of Best Film. Well-known Filmmakers like Shoojit Sircar, Vikramaditya Motwane, Rajesh Mapuskar and Komal Nahta were part of the jury. The theme 'Ingredients of Good Living' caught well with the filmmakers with some of the best films coming out of the competition.\n\nThe 2013 Edition of India Film Project saw as many as 4200+ filmmakers from 40 cities across India and neighbouring countries. The film project went online by allowing participants to shoot films from their own cities and uploading online. The project extended their filmmaking hours from 48 hours to 50 hours. The project kicked of on September 20, 2014. Versatile and award-winning filmmakers like Tigmanshu Dhulia, Nikhil Advani and Bejoy Nambiar served as the jury members. For the first time in India, an online film festival was a part of 2013 edition in association with NFDC, which allowed everyone to watch their favourite films online on their computer screen. The winning films of 2013 edition received amazing response such that they were selected for Jaipur International Film Festival for special screening.\n\nThe 2014 edition of India Film Project was announced on 28 May. The festival claimed to reach out to filmmakers from smaller towns and other countries through previous year's winning film screenings. The official trailer of 2014 edition was revealed on June 4, which featured a military theme. The trailer was shot with extensive use of VFX and sent out the message 'Shoot before you get shot'.\n\nThe jury for 2014 edition was announced in First week of August. The jury consisted of one of the Indian cinema's most prolific name Shyam Benegal and much acclaimed filmmakers Hansal Mehta, Omung Kumar and Umesh Shukla.\n\nMore than 8500 filmmakers participated in the edition from 85 cities across the world, mostly comprising India, Singapore, Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Dubai, USA and UK.

Bernard was still alive at the time the play was first performed in the West End in 1989.\n\nBernard wrote the \"Low Life\" column in \"The Spectator\". The play's title refers to the magazine's habit of printing a one-line apology on a blank page when he was too drunk or hung-over to produce the required copy and a substitute article could not be found before the deadline for publication. Its premise is that Bernard has found himself locked in overnight at his favourite public house, the Coach and Horses, Soho, and uses the occasion to share anecdotes from his life with the audience. A highlight of the play is a trick involving a glass of water, a matchbox, and an egg which must remain unbroken at the end of the trick. This trick is more fully described in an obituary of Keith Waterhouse in \"The Guardian\".\n\nOften remembered as a one-man show, but in fact packed with characters performed by a versatile supporting cast of four, \"Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell\" was a highly successful vehicle for its original star Peter O'Toole. The show opened in Brighton in September 1989, moved to Bath and made its triumphant London debut at the Apollo Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue in October. O'Toole also appeared in a later revival at the Old Vic. The Old Vic run was totally sold out, and on 23 August 1999 the London \"Evening Standard\" published a 'Bluffer's Guide' to enable readers to pretend they had seen it: \"thereby allowing dinner party conversations and watercooler debates to run their course unhindered by ignorance.\"\n\nA filmed version of the stage play was shot at the Apollo Theatre with a live audience and was released in both full and abridged versions.\n\nO'Toole was followed in the part by Tom Conti who starred in a revival of the play until September 2006 at the Garrick Theatre in London. The part has also been played by James Bolam, Dennis Waterman, Robert Powell, and most recently Simon Hill in the Frayed Knot Production of the play.\n\nA radio adaptation starring John Hurt was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 15 August, 2015 and repeated on 18 February 2017 following the death of John Hurt.\n"}
{"id": "15980726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15980726", "title": "Kadayawan Festival", "text": "Kadayawan Festival\n\nThe Kadayawan Festival is an annual festival in the city of Davao in the Philippines. Its name derives from the friendly greeting \"Madayaw\", from the Dabawenyo word \"dayaw\", meaning good, valuable, superior or beautiful. The festival is a celebration of life, a thanksgiving for the gifts of nature, the wealth of culture, the bounties of harvest and serenity of living. It is held every third week of August.\n\nThis ritual serves as their thanksgiving to the gods particularly to the \"Manama\" (the Supreme Being) and Bulan (a moon deity) that the first gathering was on a night of a full moon,\nIt was said that, long time ago, Ancient Visayans and Davao's ethnic tribes residing at the foot of Mount Apo would converge during a bountiful harvest and had to celebrate the full moon because they believed \"the diwata came to earth at that time\" so did the other islanders and tribesmen. The full moon was greeted with a variety of names- 'paghipono', 'takdul', 'ugsar'- but most significantly as \"dayaw\" [at present it is kadayaw in some Bisayan Islands], perfect or praiseworthy, fit recognition of its spectacular shape and sunset-to-sunrise brilliance. It was so beautiful that the pre-colonial people praised and believed it was the reason for their bountiful harvest\n\nVarious farming implements, fruits, flowers, vegetables, rice and corn grains were displayed on mats as villagers give their respect and thanks for the year's abundance. Singing, dancing and offerings to their divine protectors are the highlights of this ritual.\n\nAlthough times have changed, this practice of thanksgiving or \"pahinungod\" is still very much practiced by modern-day Davaoeños. This tradition flourished and evolved into an annual festival of thanksgiving.\n\nIn the 1970s, Mayor Elias B. Lopez, a Bagobo, initiated tribal festivals featuring the Lumad and the Muslim tribes of Davao City where they showcase their dances and rituals of thanksgiving.\n\nLater in 1986, a program called \"Unlad Proyekto Davao\" was initiated by the government which was aimed to unite the Dabawenyos after the turbulent Martial Law era. At that time, the festival was called \"Apo Duwaling,\" a name created from the famous icons of Davao: Mt. Apo, the country's highest peak; Durian, the king of fruits; and Waling-waling, the queen of orchids.\n\n\"Apo Duwaling\" was meant to showcase the city as a peaceful destination to visit and to do business after 1986 EDSA Revolution.\n\nFinally in 1988, City Mayor Rodrigo Duterte renamed the festival as \"Kadayawan sa Dabaw\" to celebrate the bountiful harvest of Davao's flowers, fruits and other produce as well as the wealth of the city's cultures. To this day, the festival continues to honor the city's richness and diverse artistic, cultural and historical heritage in a grand celebration of thanksgiving for all of Davao City's blessings.\n\nCultural and historical heritage, its past personified by the ancestral Lumad people, its people as they celebrate on the streets, and its floral industry as its representatives parade in full regalia in thanksgiving for the blessings granted on the city. A celebration that interfaces the three aspects: tribal; industrial and; arts and entertainment. The festivities are highlighted with floral floats, street-dancing competitions and exhibits that showcases the island's tourism products and services.\n\nToday, the recognized original tribes of Davao are here for political reasons. They are recognized because of their present-day influence since they have organized themselves well. They are given deputy mayors to be their representatives to the political powers of Davao City. The present tribes of Davao is not based on historical accounts of the original inhabitants at all. They have removed the Mansakas and Mandayas from the list and replaced them with the Muslim tribes like Maranao, Tausug, and Maguindanao. Their reason is Mansaka is from Davao del norte and Mandaya is from Davao Oriental. What they didn't notice is the places they said have \"\"Davao\" in their names while the Maguindanaos, Tausugs and Maranaos are obviously not from a place called Davao. What is more ironic is that Mandaya and Mansaka have the word \"madayaw\"\" in their dialects from which the \"Kadayawan Festival\" is derived.\n\nIf the tribes are recognized because of their present numbers in a city then the Muslim tribes (especially the Maranaos) must have been also recognized as original tribes by other cities and municipalities since they are found in numbers in every city and municipality in the Philippines.\n\nThis year bears witness to the revival of the Davao River Festival. The tribes will have their own floats and will be introduced in\nthe fluvial parade along DaWOW AMAZING (Davao) River on August 16. The parade of these colorful floats is not to be missed because the last time there was such an event was\nin 2008.\n\nDavao City takes pride of its tribal and ethnic roots. Each of the 11 tribes has its own set of dances, rituals, and customs. These are showcased in the dance competition, although the participants are not necessarily a representative of a tribe.\n\nThe indigenous people of Davao City offer performances that depict the life, history, culture, and numerous talents. Each of the\ntribes is given the chance to offer the performance of a lifetime in different timeslots and location in a series of shows.\n\nThis is a songwriting competition open to the public but focuses on the unique sounds and instrumentations of the region.\nSongwriters create Mindanaoan-inspired music that gives you a glimpse of the rich culture of Davao City and its neighbors.\n\nThe tribes pick their most talented and beautiful women to represent them, a regnant search for that distinctive indigenous young lady who is knowledgeable of her native culture and wisdom through a pageantry of Mindanaoan myths and legends. These gorgeous women will also join the parade and shower smiles.\n\nThis street parade is a must-see in the festival, with the city’s major thoroughfares closed off to traffic for the entire event. This colorful parade features graceful dancers\ndecked in splendid, colorful costumes and dancing to the beat of ethnic-inspired music. This happens on August 17.\nThe streets come alive with millions of stunning colors from the dancers and their glorious costumes and props. The\ncompetition showcases local talents whose dancing prowess can make you dance to the beat of their music. It is a day of cheers\nand smiles – prepare to be amazed.\n\nOn August 18, Pamulak sa Kadalanan brings parades to a whole new level, introducing a\ncolorful parade of majestic floral floats that offer a wide range of stunning designs and intricate craftsmanship. The event was\ndesigned to showcase the beautiful flowers and abundant vegetation grown across the\ncity.\n\nT he festival is celebrated in the month of August with floats of fresh flowers and fruits, and indak-indak sa kadalanan or street dancing in colorful costumes. A variety of tribes parade the streets with their tribal costumes and jewelry. The city of Davao comes alive every year in August when it holds it yearly harvest festival. The streets are adorned with local fruit & vegetables while people hold street dances with abandon for four days. The harbour is the venue for native & power boat races. Everybody fights for seats to watch the Horse Fighting wherein stallions fight each other over the rights to mate with a mare. The crowd is sometimes tracked by the horses if they get too close. The last day the street is full of costumed dancers dancing to the local beat & decorated floats with glamorous Mindanao girls as eye candy. It's a time of fun & abandon. The festivity is not complete without the Bya'Neng ng Kadayawan or the Miss Kadayawan beauty contest. There is also the horsefight, a tribal animal show similar to the bullfight in Spain.\n\n\n"}

Greek legend reflects Achilles shield with the depiction of a fight of his dog against two lions. A second is a Persian King Kambyses possessed a dog that started a fight with two full-grown lions. A third, is reported by a Roman historian, Claudius Aelianus, in which he states Indians showed Alexander the Great powerful dogs bred for lion-baiting. Certainly, ancient historians would embellish and exaggerate their stories, but they do capture the spirit of dog versus lion.\n\nThe Roman Empire used to import Barbary lions from North Africa for gladiatorial games.\n\nIn 1610, during the reign of James I of England the practice of lion-baiting was first recorded. The spectacle was staged for the amusement of the court. The King requested Edward Alleyn, Master of the Beargarden, to acquire the three largest and most courageous dogs. The event was as follows:\n\nIn 1790, The Times reported a lion-baiting in Vienna as follows:\n\nJ. March's, Zoological Anecdotes, circa 1845, has the story of a second lion-bait, which occurred in Vienna in the year 1791 as follows:\n\nIn 1825, two more lion fights took place, staged by a promoter named George Wombwell, who travelled around England with his collection of caged wild animals. The fights were arranged in collaboration with dog dealers Ben White and Bill George.\n\nThe cage measured fifteen feet square, ten feet high, with an elevated floor six feet from the ground. The old iron bars were wide enough apart for a dog to enter or escape.\n\nThe first bait involved the lion named \"Nero\" and the second bait a lion named \"Wallace\".\n\nThe Morning Herald of 26 July 1825, provided the following account:\n\nWombwell, in the same week, submitted another of his lions to be baited and this match proved to be a very different proposition for the dogs. The Times gave an account of the contest as follows:\n\nWallace was the first African lion to be bred in the UK, having been born in Edinburgh in 1812. He was probably named after Scottish fighter William Wallace. He died in 1838, and his stuffed body placed in the museum in Saffron Walden, Essex. When in 1930 Marriott Edgar wrote his humorous monologue \"The Lion and Albert\", he called the lion \"Wallace\".\n\nThe public were outraged at the promotion of such baiting spectacles and the matter was raised in the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Zinn wrote the play to \"show Marx as few people knew him, as a family man, struggling to support his wife and children.\" The play is set in the New York City neighborhood of Soho, a humorous nod to the London neighborhood of the same name in which Marx spent much of his life.\n\n\"Marx in Soho\" has often been produced. The play depicts Marx resurrected to defend the ideals of communism from the dehumanized version of it practiced in the former Soviet Union and to defend humanity from capitalism.\n\nZinn writes in his foreword that as early as 17, he had seen dramatic evidence \"that the machinery of government was not neutral, that, despite its pretensions, it served the capitalist class... My Communist friends brought me along with them to a demonstration in Times Square. Hundreds of people unfurled banners proclaiming opposition to war, opposition to Fascism, and marched along the street. I heard sirens. Mounted police charged the crowd. I was knocked unconscious by a plainclothes policeman. When I came to, as my head was clearing, I could only think one troubling thought: the police, the state, did the bidding of the holders of great wealth. How much freedom of speech and freedom of assembly you had depended on what class you were in.\"\n\nZinn continued: \"Karl and Jenny Marx had moved to London after he was expelled from country after country on the European continent. They lived in the grubby Soho district, and revolutionaries from all over Europe, arriving in London, trooped in and out of their home. That imagined scene — Marx at home, Marx with his wife, Jenny, with his daughter Eleanor — fascinated me.\"\n\nA \"Los Angeles Times\" reviewer, who saw a 2001 performance at the Hollywood and Highland Center starring the actor and activist Brian Jones, said that the play \"mounts a clarion defense of the principles of Marxism, while taking a timely jab at a consumerist culture run amok... Zinn's indignation oozes through the levity, and Marx's own words remind us that capitalism without conscience is a recipe for revolution.\"\n\n\"Publishers Weekly\" reviewed the play favourably: \"Laid out on the page as seamless monologue, it envisions Marx in the SoHo district of New York in the present, where his mind reels at the same capitalist injustices that boggled him 150 years ago. The wizened and ailing Marx discourses on the economic state of the modern-day U.S., heatedly decrying the vast disparity between rich and poor and the corrupt, systematic funneling of the wealth that workers earn into the hands of capitalists. Through cascading recollections, we learn of Marx's devoted marriage, his love for his children and his stormy debates with Mikhail Bakunin, a fellow radical whose concept of a revolution of the spleen rather than the intellect makes Marx seem cold by comparison... Most often it is Marx's critical wife, Jenny, and brilliant daughter Eleanor who take him to task when he fumbles. With Zinn's hefty prologue and scholarly but pointed reading list, the text is a cleverly imagined call to reconsider socialist theory as a valid philosophy in these times. Zinn's point is well made; his passion for history melds with his political vigor to make this a memorable effort and a lucid primer for readers desiring a succinct, dramatized review of Marxism.\"\n\nIn September 2014, the play was performed at the Audrey Herman Spotlighter's Theatre, directed by Sherrionne Brown and featuring Phil Gallagher as Karl Marx. The play was reviewed by DCMetroTheaterArts.com, who said: \"... is compelling and passionate and provides uncommon insight into Marx, the man, while also examining Marx, the icon\" and \"The show puts into stark relief how many of the issues of Marx’s time – income inequality, poverty, and unchecked nationalism – remain with us today.\"\n"}

It is considered to be the first Internet hoax to reach a mass audience.\n\nThe hoax comprises part of a joke cycle in which Microsoft Corporation is portrayed as a wealthy but evil monopoly built on bloated or unreliable desktop software, planned obsolescence of products, corporate takeovers of once-innovative rivals and litigiousness. While multiple books have been devoted to the subject, the jokes most commonly circulated online as Internet memes.\n\nThe hoax consisted of a press release, purportedly from the Associated Press, that circulated around the Internet in 1994. The press release claimed that Microsoft \"will acquire the Roman Catholic Church in exchange for an unspecified number of shares of Microsoft common stock,\" and that the company expects \"a lot of growth in the religious market in the next five to ten years... the combined resources of Microsoft and the Catholic Church will allow us to make religion easier and more fun for a broader range of people.\"\n\nMany of the press release's claims were unrealistic, from suggesting that Catholics would soon be able to take Holy Communion through their computer to claiming that conversion to Catholicism was an \"upgrade\". Despite these warning signs, several readers of the false press release contacted Microsoft to confirm the claims of the hoax, and on December 16, 1994, Microsoft formally debunked the claims.\n\nFollow-up press releases made similarly outrageous claims—for example, one false press release claimed that IBM had acquired the Episcopal Church, and another suggested that the Italian television network RAI had invested in what the release claimed to be \"Microsoft Corp.'s planned on-line computer service, the Microsoft Divine Network.\"\n\nAn Internet meme \"Microsoft Acquires\" spawned a series of similarly-formatted mock press releases with an assortment of varying acquisition targets, including the government of the United States of America. According to the release, \"United States citizens will be able to expect lower taxes, increases in government services, discounts on all Microsoft products and the immediate arrest of all executive officials of Sun Microsystems Inc. and Netscape Corp.\" One meta-joke claimed that Microsoft ultimately put an end to the jokes by acquiring \"Microsoft Acquires\".\n\nDespite the proliferation of chain emails circulating the Internet both in 1994 and in the present, the Microsoft hoax was considered the first such hoax to reach a mass audience through the Internet.\n"}
{"id": "57331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57331", "title": "Microwave auditory effect", "text": "Microwave auditory effect\n\nThe microwave auditory effect, also known as the microwave hearing effect or the Frey effect, consists of the human perception of audible clicks, or even speech, induced by pulsed or modulated radio frequencies. The communications are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of radar transponders during World War II. In 1961, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish information on the nature of the microwave auditory effect. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of the auditory apparatus, although competing theories explain the results of interferometric holography tests differently.\n\nAllan H. Frey was the first American to publish on the microwave auditory effect (MAE). Frey's \"Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy\" appeared in the Journal of Applied Physiology in 1961. In his experiments, the subjects were discovered to be able to hear appropriately pulsed microwave radiation, from a distance of a few inches to hundreds of feet from the transmitter. In Frey's tests, a repetition rate of 50 Hz was used, with pulse width between 10–70 microseconds. The perceived loudness was found to be linked to the peak power density, instead of average power density. At 1.245 GHz, the peak power density for perception was below 80 mW/cm. According to Frey, the induced sounds were described as \"a buzz, clicking, hiss, or knocking, depending on several transmitter parameters, i.e., pulse width and pulse-repetition rate\". By changing transmitter parameters, Frey was able to induce the \"perception of severe buffeting of the head, without such apparent vestibular symptoms as dizziness or nausea\". Other transmitter parameters induced a pins and needles sensation. Frey experimented with nerve-deaf subjects, and speculated that the human detecting mechanism was in the cochlea, but at the time of the experiment the results were inconclusive due to factors such as tinnitus.\n\nAuditory sensations of clicking or buzzing have been reported by some workers at modern day microwave transmitting sites that emit pulsed microwave radiation. Auditory response to transmitted frequencies from approximately 200 MHz to at least 3 GHz has been reported. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of auditory apparatus, and the generally accepted mechanism is rapid (but minuscule, in the range of 10 °C) heating of brain by each pulse, and the resulting pressure wave traveling through the skull to the cochlea.\n\nIn 1975, an article by neuropsychologist Don Justesen discussing radiation effects on human perceptions referred to an experiment by Joseph Sharp and Mark Grove at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research during which Sharp and Grove reportedly were able to recognize nine out of ten words transmitted by \"voice modulated microwaves\". Since the radiation levels approached the (then current) 10mW/cm² limit of safe exposure, critics have observed that under such conditions brain damage from thermal effects of high power microwave radiation would occur, and there was \"no conclusive evidence for MAE at lower energy densities\".\n\nIn 2003–04, WaveBand Corp. had a contract from the U.S. Navy for the design of an MAE system they called MEDUSA (Mob Excess Deterrent Using Silent Audio) that was intended to temporarily incapacitate personnel through remote application. Reportedly, Sierra Nevada Corp. took over the contract from Waveband. Experts, such as Kenneth Foster, a University of Pennsylvania bioengineering professor who published research on the microwave auditory effect in 1974, have discounted the effectiveness of the proposed device. Foster said that because of human biophysics, the device \"would kill you well before you were bothered by the noise\". According to former professor at the University of Washington Bill Guy, ”There’s a misunderstanding by the public and even some scientists about this auditory effect,\" and \"there couldn’t possibly be a hazard from the sound, because the heat would get you first\".\n\nMicrowave effects have been discussed as a possible source of the otherwise unexplained illnesses of U.S. diplomats in Cuba and China occurring in 2017 and 2018.\n\nNumerous individuals suffering from auditory hallucinations, delusional disorders, or other mental illnesses have claimed that government agents use forms of mind control technologies based on microwave signals to transmit sounds and thoughts into their heads as a form of electronic harassment, referring to the alleged technology as \"voice to skull\" or \"V2K\".\n\nThere are extensive online support networks and numerous websites maintained by people fearing mind control. California psychiatrist Alan Drucker has identified evidence of delusional disorders on many of these websites and other psychologists are divided over whether such sites reinforce mental troubles, or act as a form of group social support.\n\nPsychologists have identified many examples of people reporting 'mind control experiences' (MCEs) on self-published web pages that are \"highly likely to be influenced by delusional beliefs\". Common themes include \"Bad Guys\" using \"psychotronics\" and \"microwaves\", frequent mention of the CIA's MKULTRA project, and frequent citing of a scientific paper entitled \"Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34172858", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34172858", "title": "Poly Implant Prothèse", "text": "Poly Implant Prothèse\n\nPoly Implant Prothèse (PIP) was a French company founded in 1991 that produced silicone gel breast implants. The company was preemptively liquidated in 2010 following the revelation that they had been illegally manufacturing and selling breast implants made from cheaper industrial-grade silicone since 2001 (instead of the mandated medical-grade silicone they had previously used). The hundreds of thousands of unapproved implants sold globally by PIP from 2001 to 2010 were found to have a 500% higher risk of rupturing or leaking than approved models, as well as being implicated in at several deaths due to systemic toxicity and several cases of induced breast cancer. The scandal, which produced fears of a massive health disaster, prompted a full recall of the company's implants by the French health ministry in 2010, by which time the company was already defunct.\n\nPIP was founded in 1991 by the Frenchman Jean-Claude Mas, born in 1939, a former butcher and later medical sales representative for the Bristol Myers company for 15 years. Mas had previously teamed up with plastic surgeon Henri Arion, who had introduced breast implants to France in 1965. After Arion died in a plane crash, Mas went on alone and launched PIP in 1991.\n\nStarting in 1991, the company produced approximately 2 million sets of silicone breast implants over a 20-year period. The implants were exported to Latin American countries such as Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, Western European markets including Britain (25,000), Germany, Spain and Italy, as well as Australia (8900).\n\nFollowing the FDA ruling in 2000 which banned silicone breast implants in the US market (leading to a slump in sales worldwide), Mas sought to \"tighten PIP's belt\" and recoup some of its lost market share by severely cutting costs. In particular, Mas was credited with the idea that by switching PIP's silicone from externally purchased medical-grade to in-house produced industrial-grade, huge savings (on the order of 90%) could be generated that would ensure profits remained high no matter the market. As one PIP engineer later noted, \nthis decision involved a relatively small change in the formula for the silicone, enough so that only superficial differences in the end product were noted. However, none of the relevant regulations were followed for manufacturing medical implants, and no pre-launch tests were conducted.\n\n2000: Implant sales in USA halted by an FDA launched moratorium on silicone implants.\n\n2001: PIP began to use unapproved in-house manufactured industrial-grade instead of medical-grade silicone in the majority of its implants.\n\n2003: the first signs of legal problems and financial losses can be traced by regulatory filings.\n\n2009: Concerns surfaced in France first in 2009 when surgeons started reporting an abnormally high rupture rates. Which resulted in a flood of legal complaints and the company's bankruptcy.\n\n2010: TÜV Rheinland, headquartered in Germany, gave a quality certificate to the production process used by the company until March 2010. However, this didn't apply to the type of silicone used. A former PIP worker and union chief, Eric Mariaccia said, \"You had to have been a chemist to have noticed anything\". He also said that \"The responsible ones aren't the workers but the heads of the company, notably the four who were linked to production and thus responsible for their quality\".\n\n2010: In March 2010 PIP was placed into liquidation with losses of after the French medical safety agency recalled its implants. In a subsequent inspection of the manufacturing site, the company was found to use unapproved industrial-grade, silicone, with a cost of only 10% of an approved gel.\n\n2011: On December 20 French officials say that an action plan is underway following the death of a woman from ALCL. The French government recommended on December 23, 2011 that 30,000 women in France seek removal of breast implants made of a suspect silicone gel by the worldwide exporting PIP firm.\n\nMedical problems arise when breast implants rupture and cause inflammation and irritation. Further, impure gel may also release toxic substances. Removing implants \"carries risks in itself\", says the French government. By the end of 2011, eight cases of breast tumours had been uncovered in women after removing the implants, yet, while of concern, according to the French government, there is no evidence of any increased cancer risk.\n\nThe UK medical watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), says France has reported rupture rates of around 5% for PIP implants, compared with 1% in the UK. But a \"leading cosmetic surgery firm\" has privately warned ministers that the proportion of women at risk is as high as 8%. Symptoms can include lumps around the implant or in the under-arm, inflammation in the breast tissue and a hardening of the breast. Patient UK says French regulatory authority has reported a rupture rate of up to 10%, with a gel leak in 11% of cases.\n\nNigel Mercer of the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says the French move was \"certainly not unreasonable\" but the British cosmetic surgeon Kevin Hancock said the divergent government responses would cause distress for British women. Plastic surgeon Hancock, of the Liverpool Women's Hospital, says there were concerns in the profession over a high rupture rate and that \"We are worried about the rupture risk because it is the rupture that brings the contents into direct contact with the body's tissues... We know that the contents were not what they were supposed to be. So in general we agree with the (French) decision to remove them\".\n\nPatients are used as \"guinea pigs\", said Nigel Mercer, a former president of the British Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), because medical implants lack the requirement of an independent clinical trial.\n\nThe company sold a high-end product that used approved silicone for wealthier clients and which cost five times more than products with silicon gel manufactured in-house. Most PIP implants were manufactured with the in-house silicon. The lawyer, Haddad, representing the founder, said \"There is a product made by PIP which did not formally receive the [regulators'] approval and in this regard there was a violation of regulations,\". The company did not ask France's medical device safety regulators for approval of their in-house manufactured product, but expected it would have gotten approval if the company asked for it.\n\nCancer has been found in 20 women with the allegedly faulty PIP breast implants but French health authorities (Agence française de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé (AFSSAPS)) insisted there was still no proven link with the disease.\n\nAFSSAPS has as of 28 December, registered 15 cases of breast adenocarcinoma, the most frequent form of breast cancer, one case of breast lymphoma, two cases of other lymphoma, one case of lung cancer and one case of acute myelogenous leukemia in women with the implants.\n\nA French woman with a PIP breast implant where capsular scar tissue formed in the breast, which is a common occurrence with implants. This tissue developed anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), a rare form of cancer that affects the immune system cells. The cancer caused death in this case and caused the French authorities to act.\n\nDuring the 672 registered preventive extractions, in 43 cases (6.4%) the implants had ruptured and in 14 cases (2.1%) they were \"oozing\", AFSSAPS said.\nThe PIP implants have been resold as \"Rofil M-implants\".\nBritish Association of Aesthetic and Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) believes many British women may have had the bad Rofil M-implants used when they bought cut-price breast enlargement surgery from clinics in Eastern and Central Europe.\n\nThe PIP factory was shut down and their products banned after it was found they had used the chemicals Baysilone, Silopren and Rhodorsil in their implants. These chemicals are normally used as fuel additives or in the manufacture of industrial rubber tubing.\n\nIn 1993, there was an availability crisis of silicone materials for use in medical long-term implant applications. In 1993, Mas ordered the staff to \"hide the truth\" and \"We did it for 13 years without a problem\". The PIP gel cost per litre while the authorized American gel Nusil cost per litre. The PIP implants were made with 75% non-authorised gel and 25% Nusil. \"The material was better than that used to make the officially authorised gel,\" Mas said. \"Usually, from 1997 onwards we hid the products used to make the PIP gel. I wasn't allowed to buy these products because they were not authorised. We organised everything to escape being monitored.\" Investigators interviewed Mas on 18 and 19 November 2010 after the French health authority AFSSAPS discovered the PIP breast implants did not conform to regulations. They passed the case to a judge who ordered a police inquiry for \"aggravated deception\".\n\nThe bad silicone has been used to make male chest, testicle and buttock implants as well. \"Three people were specially trained to work with a machine that made silicon testicles'\" said a former PIP worker.\n\nMost of the male chest, buttock and testicle implants were exported to Latin America.\n\nThe French government recommended per December 23, 2011 that 30,000 women in France seek removal of breast implants made by PIP. For women that want to keep their implants, the state will pay for a six-month ultrasound scan.\n\nFrench public health care funds will be used to finance the recommended implant removals, at a cost estimated at . New implants will be paid for in cases where they were used initially for medical reasons, others will need to finance a new implant by themselves. Associations representing women with PIP implants demand that public funds cover all cases. \"This announcement is just a smokescreen and the victims of PIP are angry,\" said Alexandra Blachere, head of the association of PIP implant users in France.\n\nA government hotline has been set up by December 2011.\n\nIn Britain, there are an estimated 30,00040,000 affected women. The chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said, \"Women with PIP implants should not be unduly worried. We have no evidence of a link to cancer or an increased risk of rupture. If women are concerned they should speak to their surgeon\". Removing the implant \"carries risks in itself,\" she said.\n\nConcerns were filed with the UK MHRA in 2009 when a lump was found during a mammogram and ultrasound scan in a female patients breast but no action was taken by MHRA at the time.\n\nShadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said private clinics in Britain that fitted PIP implants must be forced to pick up the cost of removing them.\n\nOn 6 January 2012, NHS officials began to offer examinations and possible removal - in instances where a doctor ruled that necessary. They also called on private medical centers to offer the same deal to patients who had paid for private sector cosmetic surgery.\n\nOn 8 January 2012, \"The Sunday Times\" reported that leading cosmetic surgeon Jan Stanek had conducted a study with colleague Mike Berry into PIP implants. Their report to the Journal of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgery revealed that, in an audit of 453 patients, between 16% and 34% of the PIP implants ruptured. This compared to a failure rate of less than 1% in other implants.\n\nGermany's medical safety board and Brazil's health watchdog called for users of PIP implants to visit their doctor for checks.\n\nOn 6 January 2012 Germany's Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices recommended the removal of PIP breast implants as a precaution.\n\nThe bad breast implants were sold to about 1000 Dutch women under the name \"M-implants\" by the Dutch importer Rofil. The Dutch healthcare spokeswoman Diana Bouhys said, \"We have advised them to consult their physician\", but also declined to disclose the name of the company. PIP was the third largest maker of breast implants in the world.\n\nApproximately 5000 implants have already been sold, corresponding to an estimated 2500 Swedish women with the controversial implants. Nine clinics in Sweden has sold them says Gert Bruse of the Swedish Medical Products Agency (Läkemedelsverket) told the Dagens Nyheter (DN) newspaper this week. The agency also recommends that the implants to be removed.\n\nSweden banned the company's implants in March 2010, along with many other European countries, when it was discovered that substandard silicone gel was causing unusually many implants to burst. \"We've had cases where the implants have burst in Sweden, but it's fewer than in France in relation to how many women have these implants in both countries... Implants shouldn't burst and they shouldn't have an irritating effect that spreads throughout the body. What this company has done is criminal, simply put.\" said Bruse. PIP's implants have only been used in cosmetic breast augmentation surgery, not in reconstructive surgery.\n\nPatients from Finland often visit Tallinn to get cosmetic surgery. In October 2011 (two months before 22 December 2011), a Finnish woman in her 30s had received a different implant than what was agreed to in advance. An M-implant with the same type code as the implant from PIP was inserted instead of a promised Allergan implant. At least two Estonian clinics operating in Tallinn have offered M-implants as recently as December 2011.\n\nDocuments filed with the US government show that implants were sold until May 2000 through Heritage Worldwide, when the FDA launched a moratorium on silicone implants. At the time, the US market accounted for 40% of Heritage Worldwide's revenues, or , according to corporate documents filed in 2009 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2007 significant losses started as both users and distributors filed complaints. Between 1996 and 2009, PIP was targeted by several dozen lawsuits in the United States, filed by users and business partners, claiming breach of contract or unmet payments. Starting in 2003, dozens of women began filing lawsuits mainly for product liability against PIP. However, as of 2009, no trial date had yet been set. Many of the lawsuits were later dismissed.\n\nOn 29 December Health Minister Renato Balduzzi said that hospitals and clinics are required to compile a list of women who has received breast implants from PIP. Even clinics that didn't use any PIP implants will be required to send a declaration stating that.\n\nCzech Republic health ministry said about 2000 women with potentially faulty implants should have them removed.\n\nAccording to the Icelandic Directorate of Health, 440 women underwent breast surgery where PIP breast implants were used. The Ministry of Welfare have stated that health insured women will be offered counsel and ultrasound examination, free of charge. The Ministry of Welfare also stated that in the event that the implant is leaking, the government will pay a portion of the cost to have it removed.\n\n\nMinistry of Health and Medical Education banned the breast implants and took them off the market in 2012. They advised women that used the products to consult with a doctor and if deemed a health threat, to have them removed.\n\nThe adequacy of regulations on silicone-filled breast implants, investigation by the regulatory authorities and advice given to women implanted with PIP silicone pre-filled breast implants was criticized in December 2012 in a report examining information publicly available from the regulatory authorities.\n\nA new firm has been registered under the name France Implant Technologie (FIT), with Mas' son Nicolas Lucciardi, 27, and daughter, Peggy Lucciardi, 24, at the address of their mother, Dominique Lucciardi, who was Mas' former civil partner.\n\nThe local paper Nice-Matin obtained the business plan in which Mas is named as a \"technical-commercial consultant\" to the company and described as \"a creative genius\". Two former PIP managers were listed in senior positions in the company. With the objective to export implants to the \"European, South American and Chinese markets\". An investment of was planned to put the former PIP plant back into operation, aiming to manufacture 400 implants a day with about 20 workers. However, Nicolas Lucciardi said that the project had collapsed due to media coverage of the scandal, adding, \"That's obvious\".\n\nThe lawyer Yves Haddad is representing Mas. Legal complaints have been filed by 2500 women in France and 250 women in Britain. Mas is wanted in Costa Rica for \"life and health\" offenses, a warrant issued by Interpol.\n\nBy February 2011, TÜV Rheinland sued PIP, claiming it had been \"thoroughly and continuously misled\" regarding the silicone used. Many executives are expected to face charges of aggravated fraud in an ongoing court case in France, expected to be scheduled for October 2012, which carries the possibility of prison terms of up to five years.\nThe death of a cancer victim who had such implants may result in more serious charges of involuntary manslaughter.\n\nFrédéric Van Roekeghem, general director for La Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (French state social insurance agency, CNAM), will go to court regarding the complaints of bad implants. A criminal charge will be made within a few days he said to TF1 on 25 December 2011. The decision has been made in consultation with minister of health, Xavier Bertrand.\n\nMas has recently undergone difficult surgery regarding a vascular problem that prevents him from walking said his lawyer Haddad. Sources say a Marseilles court could soon announce fraud charges against four to six former PIP employees.\n\nA fraud case was filed against PIP on 30 December 2011 by France’s state-run health insurance fund (CNAM) officials in Marseille announced. Which is near the company’s laboratory at La Seyne-sur-Mer. On 26 January 2012 at just before 07:00 the founder Mas was arrested in the home of a friend in the Six-Fours in the Var located in South of France and taken into custody.\nInvestigators searched the house. A deputy chief executive was also arrested at his home.\n\nPhilippe Courtois, a lawyer represents 1300 women in France. Laurent Gaudon, represents four women and say a surgeon should inform about complications from both the surgery and devices used.\n\nNathalie Lozano, lawyer, represents more than 1400 women from Colombia, Argentina, United Kingdom and Venezuela. She claims TÜV Rheinland's gross negligence in the process of certifying the quality process.\n\nOn 17 April 2013, the trial of 5 executives in begun in Marseille, France. Those charged are the company founder Mr Mas, who was booed in the court, his deputy Claude Couty, the quality director Hannelore Font, technical director Loic Gossart and products chief Thierry Brinon. They face up to five years in prison. The trial was expected to last until 17 May.\n\nOn 10 December 2013, Jean-Claude Mas was sent to prison for four years, and was fined 75,000 euros (£63,000) by a court in Marseille, France.\n\nBritish Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) says that poor postmarketing surveillance is the root of the crisis, and proposes significantly more stringent monitoring of all medical devices including breast implants and all cosmetic injectables, via compulsory, regular reporting of adverse effects and mystery shopping.

{"id": "29648202", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29648202", "title": "Pusztai affair", "text": "Pusztai affair\n\nThe Pusztai affair is a controversy that began in 1998. Protein scientist Árpád Pusztai went public with the initial results of unpublished research he was conducting at the Rowett Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, investigating the possible effects of genetically modified potatoes upon rats. Pusztai claimed that the genetically modified potatoes had stunted growth and repressed the rats' immune systems while thickening their gut mucosa. Initially supported by the Rowett Institute, his comments on a British television programme caused a storm of controversy and the Rowett Institute withdrew its support. Pusztai was suspended and misconduct procedures were used to seize his data and ban him from speaking publicly. The Institute did not renew his annual contract and Pusztai was criticized by the British Royal Society and some other scientists for making an announcement before his experiment was complete or peer-reviewed, and for the experiment's design, methodology and analysis. Some of the data from the study was eventually published in The Lancet in 1999 after five out of six peer reviewers approved of the study – triggering further controversy.\n\nBefore 1995, no peer-reviewed studies had been published investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin has been shown to be toxic to some insects.\n\nTwenty-eight studies were proposed, of which eight were selected for peer review by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council. From these eight the Rowett Research Institute's proposal was chosen and a combined team of academics from the Scottish Crop Research Institute, the Durham University Department of Biology and the Rowett Institute was assembled, and coordinated by Pusztai.\n\nAlthough the tested potatoes were not a commercial variety and not intended for human consumption a contract was signed with Cambridge Agricultural Genetics, which included a profit-sharing agreement, if potatoes developed using this technology were approved and released commercially. In earlier ten-day feeding trials on GNA-fed rats, Pusztai concluded that they did not significantly affect growth, despite some hypertrophy of the small intestine and a slight decrease of gut enzyme activity.\n\nThe experimental potatoes had been transformed with the \"Galanthus nivalis agglutinin\" (GNA) gene from the \"Galanthus\" (snowdrop) plant, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin is toxic to some insects. Rats were fed raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified Desiree Red potatoes as controls. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA snowdrop lectin. Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days). Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats fed modified potatoes and rats fed the non-modified ones.\n\nThe potatoes were chosen because they were deemed substantially equivalent to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes. The study used two transgenic lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, as one of the transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.\n\nTheir experiment showed a statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.\n\nOn June 22, 1998 Pusztai revealed his research findings during an interview on Granada Television's current affairs programme \"World in Action\" titled \"Eat up your genes\". He was given permission to do the interview by Rowett Institute Director Philip James. Rowett's press officer was present at the start of filming. During the interview Pusztai said he had \"concerns that some of the testing techniques are not up to what we thought it was necessary to do, and therefore we should have more testing.\" When asked why he felt concerned, he said \"it was because we had done some experiments which made us feel concerned\" and discussed his results in general terms.\n\nPusztai later said that at the time of the interview he was not sure if he should reveal results from experiments that had not been completed and did not think the programme would be hostile toward genetically modified food. He estimated that the experiments were 99 percent complete when the interview was conducted. He said that the rats in his experiments suffered stunted growth and had suppressed immune systems and that more safety research was required. He also said, \"If you gave me the choice now, I wouldn't eat it\" and it was \"very, very unfair to use our fellow citizens as guinea pigs\".\n\n\"World in Action\" issued a press release the day before the broadcast, stimulating numerous phone calls to Pusztai and the Institute from government, industrial, non-governmental and media organisations. James says he was dismayed that unpublished data had been released and withdrew Pusztai from any further media commitments that morning. He eventually suspended Pusztai, used misconduct procedures to seize his data, banned him from speaking publicly and did not renew his annual contract.\n\nConfusion reigned over just what experiments had been conducted. Pusztai had mentioned two lines of genetically modified potatoes, meaning the two GNA lines, and this was reported by the media. The Rowett institute mistakenly assumed the media was talking about a second line transformed with concanavalin A (ConA), a Jack Bean lectin that is toxic to mammals. Transgenic ConA Potatoes had been developed, but had never been tested. Two press releases issued by the Rowett Institute on the 10th and 11th praised Pusztai's research and supported increased safety tests on genetically modified food. The press releases also said that the potatoes were modified with ConA, adding to the confusion. Pusztai claimed that he had not seen the press releases before they went out and had no opportunity to correct the mistake. James says that he drafted it and Pusztai rewrote one section, but did not see the final copy. The mistaken belief that the ConA gene was inserted into the potato led scientist Sir Robert May and Agricultural Minister Jack Cunningham to release statements to the media saying that the findings were not surprising, as a known poison had been added to the potato. Some scientists still dismiss Pusztai's work over this error.\n\nThe Rowett Institute audited Pusztai's work on 22 October 1998. It concluded that his data did not support his conclusions. In February 1999, 22 scientists from 13 countries, organised by Friends of the Earth, published a memo responding to the audit. It stated that their independent examination supported Pusztai's conclusions and that he should have been concerned by his findings.\n\nOn 19 February the Royal Society publicly announced that a committee would review his work. World in Action reporters Laurie Flynn and Michael Sean Gillard claimed that this was an unusual step, as the Royal Society did not normally conduct peer reviews. The data were sent to six anonymous reviewers and the resulting review was published in June 1999. It stated that Pusztai's experiments were poorly designed, contained uncertainties in the composition of diets, tested too few rats, used incorrect statistical methods and lacked consistency within experiments. Pusztai responded by saying the reviewers had reviewed only internal Rowett reports, which did not include the design or methodology of the experiments.\n\nThe editors of \"The Lancet\" published an editorial in May 1999 in which they denounced all parties involved, criticizing Pusztai for \"unwisely\" announcing his results on television and stating that scientists should publish \"results in the scientific press, not through the popular media\"; the editorial also denounced the Royal Society's review as \"breathtaking impertinence\".\n\nThe data were published as a letter in \"The Lancet\" in October 1999, co-authored by Ewen. It reported significant differences in the thickness of the gut epithelium of rats fed genetically modified potatoes (compared to those fed the control diet), but no differences in growth or immune system function were suggested.\n\nThe letter was reviewed by six reviewers – three times the Lancet's usual number. Four reviewers found it acceptable after revisions. A fifth thought it was flawed, but wanted it published \"to avoid suspicions of a conspiracy against Pusztai and to give colleagues a chance to see the data for themselves\". The sixth, John Pickett of the Institute of Arable Crops Research, also said it was flawed. After consulting with the Royal Society, Pickett publicly criticised \"The Lancet\" for agreeing to publish the study. The study, which used data held by Ewen, who was not subject to the veto of Pusztai's work, reported significant differences in thickness of the gut epithelium between control and test subjects, but did not mention growth or immunity problems.\n\nThe published work was criticised on the grounds that the unmodified potatoes were not a fair control diet and that any rats fed only potatoes would suffer from protein deficiency. Pusztai responded to these criticisms by saying that all the experimental diets had the same protein and energy content, and that the food intake of all rats was the same. In an interview, Pickett later said that \"Lancet\" editor Richard Horton must have had a political motive for publishing the paper because the referees had rejected it. According to Pusztai this claim was repeated by academic critics who assumed that Pickett's use of the plural suggested that the study had failed peer review.\n\nHorton claimed that he had received a \"very aggressive\" phone call calling him \"immoral\" and threatening that if he published the paper it would \"have implications for his personal position\" as editor. Peter Lachmann, the former vice-president and biological secretary of the Royal Society and president of the Academy of Medical Sciences, acknowledged making the call but denies that he threatened Horton and says the call was to \"discuss his error of judgment\" in publishing the letter and to discuss the \"moral difficulties about publishing bad science\".\n\nEwen retired following publication, claiming that his career options had been \"blocked at a very high level\".\n\nA survey by the European Food Safety Authority GMO Panel Working Group on Animal Feeding Trials concluded: \"Results obtained from testing GM food and feed in rodents indicate that large (at least 100-fold) 'safety' margins exist between animal exposure levels without observed adverse effects and estimated human daily intake. The studies did not show any biologically relevant differences in the parameters tested between control and test animals.\"\n\nIn 2005 Pusztai was given a whistleblower award from the Federation of German Scientists.\n\n\n"}

The 2017 version was the 21st year in a row that AAA has held a Rey de Reyes show and tournament. Previous Rey de Reyes tournaments consisted of several rounds, but for 2017 AAA held a nine-man Royal Rumble-style elimination match, which was won by Argenis.\n\nThe show saw several changes compared to the originally announced matches, including Johnny Mundo, the AAA Latin American Champion defeating AAA Mega Champion El Texano Jr. and AAA World Cruiserweight Champion El Hijo del Fantasma to win both championships, making him the first man to hold all three championships. In the main event of the reshuffled card Aero Star defeated Súper Fly in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\", or bet match, forcing Súper Fly to have all his hair shaved off after the match.\n\nStarting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican \"Lucha Libre\", or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's \"Rey\". Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual \"Reina de Reinas\" (\"Queen of Queens\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept.\n\nThe 2017 Rey de Reyes took place at \"Arena José Sulaimán\" in Monterrey, Nuevo León, the fourth time Rey de Reyes was held in Monterrey and the first time it was held at \"Arena José Sulaimán\". The show was the 19th Rey de Reyes show in the series. AAA had originally announced that the 2017 Rey de Reyes tournament would consist of one match, a three-way match between the three reigning AAA singles champions as El Texano Jr. (AAA Mega Championship) would face El Hijo del Fantasma (AAA World Cruiserweight Championship) and Johnny Mundo (AAA Latin American Championship).\n\nThe Rey de Reyes show featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nThe opening match, a steel cage match between the team of Pagano / El Mesias and Dark Cuervo / Dark Scoria was originally announced as the fourth match of the night, but was moved to the first instead. Under AAA rules the match could be won by escaping the cage to the floor, usually by climbing over to side to the floor. During the match Curvo climbed over the top to the floor, waiting for his partner to also exit. In the closing moments of the match El Mesias tackled Dark Scoria through the cage, driving both of them to the ground outside the ring, which was ruled as an escape for Dark Scoria. As a result of their victory Dark Cuervo and Dark Scoria earned a match for the AAA World Tag Team Championship at a future date.\n\nMari Apache was originally scheduled to be part of the #1 contender for the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship but was unable to compete due to a skull injury. AAA had announced a \"luchadora sorpresa\" (a \"surprise wrestler\") that turned out to be Mexican-Japanese Ayako Hamada who had last worked for AAA in 2008. Faby Apache was the first wrestler eliminated, followed by Goya Kong, La Hiedra and Big Mami. The match came down to Ayako and Lady Shani, with Hamada gaining the final pinfall and thus the right to challenge for the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship later on in the show.\n\nPrior to the third match of the show, Impact Wrestling representative Jeff Jarrett came to ringside with AAA official Dorian Roldan to announced that the two promotions had reached a working agreement. The next match, originally scheduled to be the main event of the show, was not only moved down the card, but was no longer for the 2017 Rey de Reyes title. Instead AAA official Vampiro announced that all three championships would be on the line in the match as AAA Mega Champion El Texano Jr. faced off against AAA World Cruiserweight Champion El Hijo del Fantasma and AAA Latin American Champion Johnny Mundo. During the match El Hijo del Fantasma was able to perform \"The Thrill of the Hunt\" (one of his signature moves, a Samoan driver onto a steel chair) on Texano Jr. After taking the move El Texano Jr. was attended to by paramedics, to give the impression that the move hurt Texano Jr. so badly that he had to be taken from the ring on a stretcher. Moments later Johnny Mundo was aided by an unidentified man who attacked El Hijo del Fantasma. The attack led to Mundo pinning El Hijo del Fantasma to win the match and become a triple champion.\n\nThe next match originally announced as a Falls count anywhere match, but was instead contested under normal tag team rules. For the match long-time rivals Psycho Clown and Dr. Wagner Jr. fought Murder Clown and Monster Clown, who had turned on both Psycho Clown and Wagner in the months leading up to the match. Psycho Clown and Dr. Wagner Jr. managed to get along well enough to defeat the two traitorous clowns. Moments after the match was over all four wrestlers were attacked by a group consisting of Carta Brava Jr., Mocho Cota Jr. and Soul Rocker who beat up all four competitors and then stole Dr. Wagner Jr.'s mask. The semi-main even match was Taya's third Reina de Reinas championship defense since winning the title in 2014 as she fought Ayako Hamada. Hamada pinned Taya cleaning, becoming the 20th \"Reina de Reinas\" in AAA history.\n\nThe semi-final match was the previously unannounced Rey de Reyes tournament, a nine-man elimination match, fought under Royal Rumble rules where a new competitor joined the match at a timed interval and wrestlers were eliminated by being thrown out of the ring. The order of elimination was Pimpinela Escarlata, Niño Hamburguesa, El Elegido, Joe Lider, La Parka, Chessman and Bengala leaving Argenis and Averno as the last two men. The final elimination happened by pinfall as Argenis pinned Averno to win the Rey de Reyes tournament and the Rey de Reyes sword that symbolizes the victory.\n\nIn the last match of the night Aero Star put his mask on the line against long time rival Súper Fly who would risk his hair in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\", or \"bet match\". During the match both wrestlers bled profusely and Aero Star's mask was torn up by Súper Fly. At one point the two wrestlers fought outside the ring, with Aero Star climbing to the second level of the arena, only to leap off the edge onto Súper Fly who was positioned below. At one point Súper Fly used a pair of brass knuckles to hit Aero Star to get the pinfall and looked like he had won the match. Vampiro made his way to ringside and informed the referee of what had happened and restarted the match. The restart allowed Aero Star to pin his opponent, forcing Súper Fly to kneel in the middle of the ring and have all his hair shaved off as per the \"Lucha de Apuestas\" stipulation.\n\n"}
{"id": "13863105", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13863105", "title": "Round Table (tournament)", "text": "Round Table (tournament)\n\nA Round Table was a festive event during the Middle Ages that involved jousting, feasting, and dancing in imitation of King Arthur's legendary court. Named for Arthur's famed Round Table, the festivals generally involved jousts with blunted weapons, and often celebrated weddings or victories. In some cases participants dressed in the costume of such well-known knights as Lancelot, Tristan, and Palamedes. The first recorded instance of this activity was in 1223, when the Crusader lord of Beirut held one in Cyprus to celebrate the knighting of his eldest sons.\n\nEdward I held one on the occasion of his marriage, and one in 1284 to celebrate his conquest of Wales; and is recorded as sponsoring several as late as 1304. One artefact that has survived from this fashion in England is the \"Winchester Round Table\" in the Great Hall at Winchester Castle. The timber of this table has been dated by dendrochronology to 1275, during Edward's reign, though a royal provenance is not proven so far. The present \"Winchester Round Table\" was painted in 1522 by order of King Henry VIII. The places at the table are divided up with alternating green and white panels with the name of Arthurian knights written in gold. However it is King Henry VIII's portrait that is painted at King Arthur's place, and the Tudor red rose that adorns the table's centre. \n\nEdward III held a tournament and feast at Windsor in 1344 and built a huge round structure to house it. The details of its use are obscure. However, it is believed that he intended to found an order of knighthood named after the Round Table and modelled on the fellowship of King Arthur; in the event, in 1348, the order he established was named after the Garter.\n\nRound Tables were an aristocratic activity throughout Europe from the 13th until the 15th centuries. They are recorded in France from 1235 to 1332. In Aragon they were held as early as 1269 in Valencia and as late as 1291 in Catalonia. According to Roger Sherman Loomis, \"Popes and prelates thundered against these costly, dangerous, and sometimes licentious frivolities, and denied Christian burial to those who took part.\" Even the middle classes were caught up in this spectacle. In 1281, a burgher of Magdeburg announced a Round Table in that town. Another was set up by the burghers of Tournai in 1330. Rene d'Anjou went so far as to construct a castle for his 1446 Round Table.\n"}

() is Korea's largest entertainment company, founded in 1995 by Lee Soo-man. The company has developed and popularized numerous K-pop stars with huge global fandoms. SM is known for having led the global K-pop phenomenon and the musical side of “Hallyu,” also known as the “Korean Wave.” Representative of the entertainment industry in Asia, the company operates its own comprehensive entertainment business including artist development, record label services, talent agency services, music production, music publishing, event management and concert production.\n\nThe label is home to prominent K-pop artists such as EXO, Red Velvet, NCT, Super Junior, Girls' Generation, TVXQ, Shinee, f(x), BoA, S.E.S., Kangta, TRAX, The Grace, J-Min, and Zhou Mi, and produced and popularized artists like H.O.T., Fly to the Sky, Shinhwa, and Henry Lau. It also manages a number of actors, including Kim Min-jong and Lee Yeon-hee. In Japan, SM Entertainment co-publishes Avex Trax releases for artists including Ayumi Hamasaki, Namie Amuro, and Koda Kumi, as well as Johnny's Entertainment artists such as Arashi and KAT-TUN.\n\nIn 2015, SM Entertainment had reported revenues of KR₩325 billion (approximately US$287 million) and a net income of KR₩21.7 billion (US$19 million).\n\nAfter graduating from California State University, Northridge in the United States, Lee Soo-man returned to Korea and in 1989 established what was then known as \"SM Studio\" in the Apgujeong neighborhood of Gangnam, Seoul. In February 1995, the company changed its name to SM Entertainment and set up its capital fund. SM then developed an in-house production system and created a string of successful artists, including boy band H.O.T. in 1996, girl group S.E.S. in 1997, boy band Shinhwa in 1998, R&B duo Fly to the Sky in 1999, and soloist BoA in 2000.\n\nJung Hae-ik was appointed CEO at the time of SM Entertainment's official reestablishment in 1995, and was succeeded by Kim Kyung-wook in 1998.\n\nThe early 2000s saw the disbandment of both H.O.T (in 2001) and S.E.S (in 2002). Shinhwa departed to a new agency, and new acts like the duo Isak N Jiyeon and the boy band Black Beat failed to attain the popularity of previous SM artists. In December 2000, SM established an affiliate company called Fandango Korea. In January 2001, the company founded an overseas division, SM Entertainment Japan. Around the same time, the company was approved for listing on KOSDAQ, and SM established an affiliation with the Japanese major label Avex Trax. SM also formed the subsidiaries BM Entertainment and Cid. K Entertainment (under which the girl groups M.I.L.K. and Shinvi were signed, respectively), but they later dissolved when their groups disbanded.\n\nIn late 2002, SM was awarded the Grand Prix of Ministry of Culture and Tourism for the Culture Contents for Export Award in music.\n\nIn 2003, SM became affiliated with Starlight Corporation Ltd. and C-Cube Entertainment Corporation. That same year, the company debuted five-member boy group TVXQ. The following years saw the debuts of artists such as TRAX (2004), The Grace (2005), and Super Junior (2005).\n\nIn 2005, Kim Young-min became the company's third CEO, under whom several artists debuted with a view to promoting outside of South Korea. Artists produced by SM during this period included Chinese-born soloist Zhang Liyin (2006), Japanese-language soloist J-Min (2007), Girls' Generation (2007), Shinee (2008), and f(x) (2009). In April 2008, SM debuted a Mandarin-language sub-unit of Super Junior, named Super Junior-M. In October 2008, SM announced plans for BoA’s debut in the American market, under a newly formed subsidiary label named SM Entertainment USA.\n\nIn May 2008, the SM Art Company opened under co-CEO Pyo In-bong, with a focus on producing theatrical works. The company’s first venture was a production of the American musical comedy \"Xanadu\", starring Super Junior members Heechul and Kangin.\n\nIn February 2010, after two decades on SM Entertainment’s board of directors, founder Lee Soo-man resigned from his position in order to \"focus more energy on SM's overseas business, new business management, and artist development.” In March of the same year, KMP Holdings was established as a joint venture between SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, Star Empire, Medialine, CAN Entertainment, and Music Factory. The firm's first release from SM was Super Junior's fifth studio album, \"Mr. Simple\", which marked the end of SM's self-distribution. In May, SM announced its highest ever first quarter operating profits, at KR, up 471% from the same period the previous year. Gross revenue was reported at KR, a 58% increase on the previous year.\n\nIn April 2011, SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, KeyEast, AMENT, and Star J Entertainment came together to form United Asia Management, a joint investment agency geared towards advancing Asian music worldwide. That August, SM joined with Thai media company TrueVisions to create an international joint venture, SM True.\n\nIn 2012, SM debuted the large-scale boy group EXO, split into two units in order to promote in Korea and China simultaneously. In February, SM acquired Hawaiian travel firm Happy Hawaii and launched SMTown Travel, a new business initiative specializing in travel and tourism under Kang Jung-hyun. Later that year, SMTown Travel offered package deals for overseas fans attending Super Junior's \"Super Show 4 Tour\" encore concerts in Seoul. In March, 47 of SM Entertainment’s recording artists became stockholders of the company. Kangta, BoA, and most members of Super Junior and Girls’ Generation received 680 shares each (with a value of approximately US$27,200 per person), while members of more recent groups like Shinee and f(x) received 340 shares each (with a value of around US$13,600 per person). In August, SM held an art exhibition at the COEX Convention & Exhibition Center, and collaborated with Visa and KB Kookmin Card to begin printing SM artist cards. That same month, Korean TV personalities Kang Ho-dong and Shin Dong-yup announced that they had signed exclusive contracts with SM's new broadcasting subsidiary, SM Culture & Contents (SM C&C), marking SM’s expansion into television. The next month, in September, SM C&C merged with AM Entertainment (which then represented top actors such as Jang Dong-gun, Kim Ha-neul, and Han Ji-min), and two other TV personalities, Lee Su-geun and Kim Byung-man, announced that they had also signed with SM. In November, KMP Holdings was acquired by KT Music, and in June 2013, KT Music absorbed KMP's distribution network.\n\nIn 2013, SM C&C acquired Hoon Media (a production company led by Lee Hoon-hee, responsible for KBS serials \"1 vs 100\", \"Heroines 6\", \"Qualifications of Men\", and \"Music Bank\") and Woollim Entertainment, a record label responsible for artists such as Infinite. In January 2014, SM and the other six talent agencies behind KMP Holdings formed a collective bond partnership and bought 13.48% of KT Music's stocks, leaving parent KT Corporation with 49.99%. In February, SM acquired a share in Baljunso, an indie record label founded in 1991 by Kang Byung-yong. On August 1, SM debuted Red Velvet, its first girl group since f(x) five years prior.\n\nIn August 2015, SM partnered with sports marketing company IB Worldwide to create Galaxia SM, responsible for golfer Park In-bee, gymnast Son Yeon-jae, and Choo Shin-soo, right fielder for the Texas Rangers. On November 6, the 10th anniversary of Super Junior's debut, SM announced the creation of the group's own sub-label, Label SJ. In late 2015, SM partnered with modeling company ESteem to promote self-owned content and network. The venture later expanded its acting division through the acting debuts of models Ki Do-hoon and Lee Cheol-woo.oo.\n\nIn January 2016, founder Lee Soo-man held a conference at the SM Coex Artium, announcing plans for a new boy group, NCT (Neo Culture Technology), with \"unlimited members\". The first unit of this group, NCT U, released its first two singles in April 2016. At the beginning of the year, the company opened a restaurant, SMT Seoul, and also established a series of stores selling branded foods under the name SUM Market.\n\nOn February 11, 2016, the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group acquired a 4 percent minority stake in SM Entertainment for $30 million USD.\n\nOn May 5, 2016, SM released the first single under its newly established EDM label ScreaM Records, \"Wave\", featuring f(x) members Amber and Luna and produced by Xavi & Gi and E-mart’s Electro Mart. ScreaM Records opened as part of SM's New Culture Technology 2016 project, under which SM also initiated the digital music channel SM Station and a number of mobile apps. In late 2016, SM began organizing a \"League of Legends\" tournament called SM Super Celeb League, in which SM artists Heechul and Baekhyun played against both professional gamers and fans from South Korea and China.\n\nOn February 16, 2017, a source from the task force in charge of the \"international K-pop academy\" has plans to open this upcoming September. The Gangnam-based academy is a collaborative venture with the private Jongro Sky Academy. Plans for the school to be certified as an alternative program for domestic Korean middle and high school education, as well as US secondary school education, are also underway.\n\nIn March 2017, SM acquired the independent record label Mystic Entertainment, becoming the label's largest shareholder.\n\nSource:\n\nAll artists under SM Entertainment are collectively known as SMTown.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProducer/composer\n\nKorean lyricist\n\nChinese lyricist\n\nChoreographer\n\nPianists\n\nNote\n\n\nIn late July 2009, three of the five original members of SM Entertainment boy group TVXQ – Kim Jaejoong, Park Yoochun, and Kim Junsu – applied to the Seoul Central District Court to investigate the validity of their contract with SM, as they felt the thirteen-year contract was excessively long and that earnings were not fairly distributed to the members, but contract destruction, they shall be compensated to the Employer by three times the total investment amount and two times the ordinary profit during the remaining contract period. The news of this dispute caused SM Entertainment's KOSPI stock price to drop by 10.06%. In addition, 120,000 fans of TVXQ filed a petition against SM's long-term contracts to the Seoul Central District Court, and also filed for compensation for an SMTown Live Concert that was canceled a week before its scheduled date.\n\nTheir statement read, \"(They) have had health problems and finally reached their physical limits, but SM Entertainment continued to send them abroad and plan excessive activities. Thus, the three members have started to hope they will be able to continue their careers as they wish, instead of being used as tools for the agency's profits.\"\n\nThe court ruled in the favour of the three ex-members. In response, SM held a press conference claiming that the lawsuit was fraudulent, and filed an injunction. In early May 2010, it was announced that Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu would return to the stage as JYJ under a new management agency, C-JeS Entertainment. The injunction was dismissed by the Seoul Central District Court on February 17, 2011, and the final decision on the case was postponed indefinitely for mediation under the justice department.\n\nOn November 28, 2012, during a voluntary arbitration at the Seoul Central District Court, SM Entertainment and JYJ reached a mutual agreement to terminate all contracts between the two parties and not to interfere with each other's activities in the future, concluding the lawsuit. SM reportedly stated that they had decided to end the litigation \"to avoid bringing additional harm to U-Know Yunho and Max Changmin, who are active as TVXQ, and to avoid making any more unneeded issues.\"\n\nOn December 21, 2009, five months after the three former TVXQ members filed their lawsuit and while the dispute was still active, Han Geng, the only Chinese member of Super Junior, also filed a lawsuit against SM. Han Geng filed for similar reasons: unfair profit distribution, and an unfair thirteen-year contract that contained provisions in SM's favor that he was not allowed to revise or end. The artist's friend and later manager Sun Le also submitted a statement to the Korean courts citing SM Entertainment's violation of Han Geng's rights, which was later leaked via the internet. The statement argued that SM had discriminated against Han Geng financially as well as in terms of management.\n\nOn September 27, 2011, Han Geng's departure from Super Junior was made official when legal representatives of both Han Geng and SM released a joint statement saying that \"Han Geng and SM Entertainment have amicably settled on a mutual agreement, and the lawsuit was able to come to a close after Han Geng submitted his 'Notice of Withdrawal of Appeal.'\"\n\nOn May 15, 2014, Kris Wu, a Chinese-Canadian member of EXO, filed a lawsuit to terminate his contract with SM, as first reported by Chinese news portal Sina. He was represented by Cho Bum-suk, the same lawyer that handled Han Geng's case. Kris, whose real name is Wu Yifan, was quoted as saying, \"The company has treated me like a machine part or as an object of control rather than presenting a vision as an entertainer.\" He left the group in the same month that the lawsuit was made public, while the rest of the group continued to promote their single \"Overdose.\" On July 21, 2016, Kris officially parted ways with EXO, although his contract with SM remains valid until 2022.\n\nOn September 29, 2014, Girls' Generation member Jessica claimed in a Weibo post that she had been forced out of the group, writing:\"I was excited about our upcoming fan events only to shockingly be informed by my company and 8 others that as of today, I'm no longer a member. I'm devastated - my priority and love is to serve as a member of GG, but for no justifiable reason, I am being forced out\".The following day, Jessica released a statement claiming that in August 2014 her fellow group members and SM had been positive about the launch of her fashion business, Blanc and Eclare. As of early September, she claimed, they had all changed their stance, and she was directed to either close the business or cease promotions as a member of Girls' Generation. She claimed to have received the day before a \"one-sided notice\" asking her to leave the group.\n\nHowever, according to SM, Jessica had unilaterally informed them in early spring that she would leave the group after one more album. But before agreements could be made, she had set up her independent business, which caused problems for the group's professional schedules. This prompted management to begin promoting Girls' Generation as eight members rather than nine, with the intention of announcing the news; however, Jessica had already \"posted her own perspective”. The company then stated that the group would henceforth continue as eight, while they would still manage Jessica's individual schedule. In the days immediately after this news came to light, company stocks dropped by KR₩3,350 per share, from KR₩40,750 to KR₩37,400, losing SM a total of KR₩69 billion (approximately US$65 million).\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Jessica and SM Entertainment reached an agreement to terminate her contract, with Jessica stating, \"This release is to confirm that SM Entertainment ('SM') and I have officially parted ways. I will cherish the many years we spent and I wish SM the best of luck in all of its endeavors.\"\n\nOn October 10, 2014, Lu Han became the second Chinese member of EXO to file to nullify his contract with SM Entertainment and leave the group, just over four months after Kris had done the same. His lawsuit included the claim that SM had favored the Korean sub-unit EXO-K over the Chinese sub-unit EXO-M. Within 15 minutes of the announcement, company stocks had dropped by 9.41%, from KR₩37,000 to KR₩33,250 per share. The stock's worth contracted by 15%, hitting the maximum decrease in price KOSDAQ allows for a day, and falling to a more-than-one-year low. On July 21, 2016, Lu Han officially parted ways with EXO, although his contract with SM remains valid until 2022.\n\nIn April 2015, No Min-woo, a former member of TRAX, filed a lawsuit against SM for subjecting him to an unlawful seventeen-year contract. No alleged that SM had also interfered with his career after he had left the company, and sought KR₩100 million in damages. No lost his lawsuit against SM Entertainment on July 21, 2016.\n\nOn August 24, 2015, Tao became the third Chinese member of EXO to file against SM and leave the group, being represented by the same legal team that represented former members Kris and Lu Han. On January 5, 2016, SM won one of its counter-lawsuits against Tao per the ruling of the Intermediate People's Court in Qingdao, China. The agency sued Tao over his failure to repay the company after his departure. They released an official statement saying, \"SM has ongoing lawsuits against EXO members Wu Yifan (Kris), Luhan, and Tao for violating their exclusive contracts and partaking in illegal promotions in China. Among these lawsuits, SM filed a lawsuit against Tao for failing to repay SM on October 13, 2015. An intermediate court in Qingdao, China made the verdict that Tao is to repay SM Entertainment as well as interest for the delayed payment.\"\n\nOn November 21, 2009, SM Entertainment boycotted the Mnet Asian Music Awards event, claiming reservations regarding the standard of fairness and the criteria used in Mnet's selections for award recipients. The company specifically mentioned Girls' Generation, who had topped Korean music charts for nine consecutive weeks and had won numerous awards for their single \"Genie\", but had never won on Mnet's weekly M! Countdown show, and had only appeared on their charts a month after the album release. SM also cited the fact that voters had to pay a fee, saying that they \"did not want to see fans suffer any damage from the poll, which has commercial intentions.\"\n\nIn 2010, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) undertook an investigation into SM Entertainment's policies, especially regarding artists' contract terms, and concluded that they were unfair. Artist contracts were subsequently reduced by a length of three years, and there was a reduction in the penalties for breach-of-contract violations. All the artists signed under SM at the time re-contracted with the agency under the new terms.\n\nSM was also one of fifteen companies sued and fined by the KFTC for price rigging in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, SM was accused of colluding with music distributors, but was cleared of the charge. On August 16, the Seoul High Court revealed their verdict on the issue: \"The KFTC has canceled all corrective orders against SM Entertainment, and the lawsuit costs will be paid by the defendant.\"\n\nIn August 2014, after the release of Red Velvet's music video for \"Happiness\", Japanese media reported that images referencing the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as the 9/11 attacks, were seen in the background of the video. SM Entertainment responded to the reports, stating that \"after questioning the director, we found that he simply used a collage source for the images, and there was no intention behind it.\" The representative added, \"As SM wasn't able to catch it before, we will remove the material that caused the misunderstanding as soon as possible. We will make sure not to let this kind of thing happen in the future.\" SM later uploaded a new version of the music video without the controversial images.\n"}

Nichols Arboretum is a 123-acre (49.7 hectares) heavily wooded park, with large landscape lawns surrounded by the woods, a river, and steep hills. The plays are moving events, with both performers and audience moving from location to location within the park as the play progresses. At each location a segment of the play is performed. The plays begin in the early evening, and are put on near the summer solstice as no artificial lighting is used.\n\nThe park is near to the University of Michigan, and downtown Ann Arbor Michigan.\n\nShakespeare in the Arb was founded in 2001 by Inger Schultz, and Kate Mendeloff. Mendeloff has been the artistic director since its inception.\n\nEach year one play is presented. Most years, three weeks (Thurs-Sun) of performances are given. They all begin fours hours before sunset, at 6:30 p.m. local time (EDT). Each performance takes about 2.5 hours. The production travels from spot to spot within the arboretum to create the different scenes. \"As one critic commented, 'The actors used the vastness of its Arb[oretum] stage to full advantage, making entrances from behind trees, appearing over rises and vanishing into the woods.'\"\n\nThe arboretum is a public park, situated in the center of an urban area, next to a railroad track, and a large medical center. Thus performances can be interrupted by trains, medevac helicopters, and other park visitors. The weather is a factor, with large rainstorms always possible.\n\nSince the beginning of its second season, Shakespeare in the Arb, has sold out nearly every performance. Tickets are sold on the day of the performances, and are first-come, first-served. The line for tickets begins forming two hours before the box office opens, as \"Shakespeare in the Arb is a hugely popular local summer tradition.\" \n\nA particular favorite is A Midsummer Night's Dream. The play—with its natural setting, structure, and language—is perfect for presenting in the arboretum, which features dense heavy woods with mature trees, large lawns, steep hills, and a river. In 2015, A Midsummer Night's Dream was presented for the third time since the festival began.\n\n"}

It is across the street from the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples.\n\nThe house is named after the Sicilian-born composer, Vincenzo Bellini, who is best known for his operas and who spent his some time in the 1820s studying music in the city. In addition, there in an opera house name after him—the Teatro Massimo Bellini—in Catania, Sicily, his birthplace.\n\nIn 1864, Baron Nicola Lacapra Sabelli commissioned the theatre's creation from the architect Carlo Sorgente for the Via Vincenzo Bellini. This theatre, located near Piazza Dante Alighieri, burned down in 1869, and a new one was inaugurated a few hundred feet from the original locale. \n\nOn 6 February 1877 it presented Bellini's opera, \"I puritani\". The theatre has 6 tiers of box seats surrounding an oval floor. The interior decorations were created by Giovanni Ponticelli, Pasquale Di Criscito, and Vincenzo Paliotti, and the oil portrait of the opera composer was by Vincenzo Migliaro.\n\nFor nearly a century, the theatre presented operas and operettas, but by the 1960s it had become dilapidated, used only as a cheap movie theatre, and it was considered for demolition. In 1962 the Bellini hosted its final operatic spectacle with \"Masaniello\" before being acquired in 1986 by a group led by local artist and producer, Tato Russo. They restored the house for operatic and theatrical productions which are now frequently presented.\n"}

It was opened on July 30, 1793 by Queen Maria I as a replacement for the Tejo Opera House, which was destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. The theatre is located in the historical center of Lisbon, in the Chiado district.\n\nIn 1792, a group of Lisbon businessmen decided to finance the construction of a new Opera House in the city. The theatre was built in only six months following a design by Portuguese architect José da Costa e Silva, with neoclassical and rococo elements. The general project is clearly inspired by great Italian theatres like the San Carlo of Naples (interior) and La Scala in Milan (interior and façade). In the early 19th century, when the Portuguese Royal Court had to flee to the Portuguese colony of Brazil to escape the invading Napoleonic troops, a theatre modelled on the São Carlos was built in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe theatre was erected honor of the Princess Charlotte of Spain, who had come to Portugal in 1790 to marry the future King, Prince John: Carlos (Portuguese form of Charles) is the masculine form of Charlotte. A Latin commemorative inscription dedicates the theatre to the princess.\n\nThe first opera presented here, in 1793, was \"La Ballerina Amante\", by Domenico Cimarosa. The most famous Portuguese composer of the time, Marcos Portugal, became musical director of the São Carlos in 1800 after returning from Italy, and many of his operas were staged here.\n\nBetween 1828 and 1834, the São Carlos was closed during the Portuguese Civil War, fought between kings Miguel I and Pedro IV. In 1850, the lighting of the interior was changed to gas illumination, the latest technology available. Shortly afterwards, the Portuguese state bought the theatre from private investors. After a few failed attempts, electrical illumination was installed in 1887. From 1935 to 1940, the theatre was closed for repairs.\n\nIn 1974, a resident opera company was established. In 1993, the Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa was created as the Teatro's affiliate orchestra, with Álvaro Cassuto as the orchestra's first principal conductor. Subsequent principal conductors of the Orquestra Sinfónica Portuguesa have included José Ramón Encinar (1999-2001), Zoltán Peskó (2001-2004) and Julia Jones (2008-2011). Since January 2014, the orchestra's principal conductor is Joana Carneiro.\n\nThe theatre building was classified as Property of Public Interest in 1928 and has been reclassified as a National Monument since 1996.\n\nLongitudinal and composite building with articulated parts has a sober facade. The frontispiece is divided into 3 parts: 2 floors on mezzanine and a third floor on the central body. This central body is torn by a portico (entrance hall), and has a loggia at the ground level composed of 3 frontal arches and a lateral, in perfect round. The loggia is crowned by a perfect terrace of balustrade in stonework. Here, the windows are framed by parastase, that supports a highlighted cornice. They also have a crown composed of panels with inscription and two high reliefs. At the level of the third floor, this same central body presents a clock surrounded by garlands and two windows, all of which is surmounted by two pinnacles and the Portuguese coats-of-arms.At the level of the first floor, the two side bodies have two straight-polished doors crowned by low windows. Although with the same two windows, at the second floor level they feature balustrade in stonework, protruding cornice and a small window in the mezzanine area. \n\nThe main room (performance hall) is elliptic, has five tiers of boxes and seats 1148 people. The luxurious royal box was lavishly decorated by the Italian Giovanni Appianni. The ceiling was painted by Manuel da Costa and the stage by Cirilo Wolkmar Machado.\n\n"}

It lasted until the rise of the Song dynasty, which was founded in 960. Nine of the kingdoms were in the South and one small kingdom was in the far North. Many states were \"de facto\" independent long before the Tang Empire dissolved. The last of the Ten Kingdoms, the Northern Han, survived until 979.\n\nUnlike the Five Dynasties of northern China, which succeeded one other in rapid succession, the regimes of South China were generally concurrent, each controlling a specific geographical area. Each court was a center of artistic excellence. The period is noted for the vitality of its poetry and for its economic prosperity. Commerce grew so quickly that there was a shortage of metallic currency. This was partly addressed by the creation of bank drafts, or \"flying money\" (\"feiqian\"), as well as by certificates of deposit. Wood block printing became common during this period, 500 years before Johannes Gutenberg's press.\n\nThe Ten Kingdoms were:\n\nOnly ten are traditionally listed, hence the era's name. Some historians, such as Bo Yang, count eleven, including Yan and Qi but not the Northern Han, viewing it as simply a continuation of Later Han. This era also led to the founding of the Liao dynasty in the north.\n\nOther regimes during this period were Yan, Qi, Zhao, Yiwu Jiedushi, Dingnan Jiedushi, Wuping Jiedushi, Qingyuan Jiedushi, Yin, Ganzhou, Shazhou, and Liangzhou.\n\nThe Kingdom of Wu (902–937) was established in modern-day Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi. It was founded by Yang Xingmi, who became a Tang Dynasty military governor in 892. The capital was initially at Guangling (present-day Yangzhou) and later moved to Jinling (present-day Nanjing). The kingdom fell in 937 when it was taken from within by the founder of the Southern Tang.\n\nThe Kingdom of Wuyue was the longest-lived (907–978) and among the most powerful of the southern states. Wuyue was known for its learning and culture. It was founded by Qian Liu, who set up his capital at Xifu (modern-day Hangzhou). It was based mostly in modern Zhejiang province but also held parts of southern Jiangsu. Qian Liu was named the Prince of Yue by the Tang emperor in 902; the Prince of Wu was added in 904. After the fall of the Tang Dynasty in 907, he declared himself king of Wuyue. Wuyue survived until the eighteenth year of the Song dynasty, when Qian Shu surrendered to the expanding dynasty.\n\nThe Kingdom of Min (909–945) was founded by Wang Shenzhi, who named himself the Prince of Min with its capital at Changle (present-day Fuzhou). One of Shenzhi's sons proclaimed the independent state of Yin in the northeast of Min territory. The Southern Tang took that territory after the Min asked for help. Despite declaring loyalty to the neighboring Wuyue, the Southern Tang finished its conquest of Min in 945.\n\nThe Southern Han (917–971) was founded in Guangzhou (also known as Canton) by Liu Yan. His brother, Liu Yin, was named regional governor by the Tang court. The kingdom included Guangdong, Guangxi, Hanoi, and Hainan.\n\nThe Chu (927–951) was founded by Ma Yin with the capital at Changsha. The kingdom held Hunan and northeastern Guangxi. Ma was named regional military governor by the Tang court in 896, and named himself the Prince of Chu with the fall of the Tang in 907. This status as the Prince of Chu was confirmed by the Later Tang in 927. The Southern Tang absorbed the state in 951 and moved the royal family to its capital in Nanjing, although Southern Tang rule of the region was temporary, as the next year former Chu military officers under the leadership of Liu Yan seized the territory. In the waning years of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, the region was ruled by Zhou Xingfeng.\n\nThe Northern Han was founded by Liu Min (劉旻), formerly known as Liu Chong (劉崇), and lasted from 951 to 979.\nIt has the capital at Taiyuan.\n\nThe smallest of the southern states, Jingnan (924–963), was founded by Gao Jichang. It was based in Jiangling and held two other districts southwest of present-day Wuhan in Hubei. Gao was in the service of the Later Liang (the successor of the Tang in North China). Gao's successors claimed the title of King of Nanping after the fall of the Later Liang in 924. It was a small and weak kingdom, and thus tried to maintain good relations with each of the Five Dynasties. The kingdom fell to advancing armies of the Song in 963.\n\nFormer Shu (907–25) was founded after the fall of the Tang Dynasty by Wang Jian, who held his court in Chengdu. The kingdom held most of present-day Sichuan, western Hubei, and parts of southern Gansu and Shaanxi. Wang was named military governor of western Sichuan by the Tang court in 891. The kingdom fell when his son surrendered in the face of an advance by the Later Tang in 925.\n\nThe Later Shu (935–965) is essentially a resurrection of the previous Shu state that had fallen a decade earlier to the Later Tang. Because the Later Tang was in decline, Meng Zhixiang found the opportunity to reassert Shu's independence. Like the Former Shu, the capital was at Chengdu and it basically controlled the same territory as its predecessor. The kingdom was ruled well until forced to succumb to Song armies in 965.\n\nThe Southern Tang (937–975) was the successor state of Wu as Li Bian (Emperor Liezu) took the state over from within in 937. Expanding from the original domains of Wu, it eventually took over Yin, Min, and Chu, holding present-day southern Anhui, southern Jiangsu, much of Jiangxi, Hunan, and eastern Hubei at its height. The kingdom became nominally subordinate to the expanding Song in 961 and was invaded outright in 975, when it was formally absorbed into Song China.\n\nAlthough more stable than northern China as a whole, southern China was also torn apart by warfare. Wu quarrelled with its neighbours, a trend that continued as Wu was replaced with Southern Tang. In the 940s Min and Chu underwent internal crises which Southern Tang handily took advantage of, destroying Min in 945 and Chu in 951. Remnants of Min and Chu, however, survived in the form of Qingyuan Jiedushi and Wuping Jiedushi for many years after. With this, Southern Tang became the undisputedly most powerful regime in southern China. However, it was unable to defeat incursions by the Later Zhou between 956 and 958, and ceded all of its land north of the Yangtze River.\n\nThe Song dynasty, established in 960, was determined to reunify China. Jingnan and Wuping Jiedushi were swept away in 963, Later Shu in 965, Southern Han in 971, and Southern Tang in 975. Finally, Wuyue and Qingyuan Jiedushi gave up their land to Northern Song in 978, bringing all of southern China under the control of the central government.\n\nIn common with other periods of fragmentation, the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period resulted in a division between northern and southern China. The greater stability of the Ten Kingdoms, especially the longevity of Wu Yue and Southern Han, would contribute to the development of distinct regional identities within China.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23587956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23587956", "title": "The Fall of Robespierre", "text": "The Fall of Robespierre\n\nThe Fall of Robespierre is a three-act play written by Robert Southey and Samuel Coleridge in 1794. It follows the events in France after the downfall of Maximilien Robespierre. Robespierre is portrayed as a tyrant, but Southey's contributions praise him as a destroyer of despotism. The play does not operate as an effective drama for the stage, but rather as a sort of dramatic poem with each act being a different scene. According to Coleridge, \"my sole aim to imitate the impassioned and highly figurative language of the French Orators and develop the characters of the chief actors on a vast stage of horrors.\"\n\nTo raise money, Southey and Coleridge began to work together in August 1794. According to Southey the project began in \"sportive conversation\" at the house of their friend Robert Lovell. The three intended to collaborate on a play that would deal with the beheading of Robespierre in July 1794. Their source was news articles that described the final moments of a dispute within the National Assembly. During composition, they were able to write 800 lines in just two days. The play was divided between the three collaborators, with Coleridge composing the first act, Southey composing the second act and Lovell the third. Southey and Lovell completed their acts but Coleridge had only finished part of his the following evening. Southey felt that Lowell's contribution was not \"in keeping\" and so rewrote the third act himself. Coleridge completed his act. When they turned to Joseph Cottle to publish the work, he refused and Coleridge had to search for another publisher. He took the manuscript to Cambridge, revising and improving his own contribution. Eventually, the work was published in October 1794 by Benjamin Flower. Five hundred copies were printed and circulated in Bath, Cambridge, and London, which brought the writers fame while their personal relationship grew tense.\n\nThe events that inspired the work involve Robespierre's taking over of the National Assembly and removing the moderate members. During this time, he also allowed the executions of many individuals and became the center of power during the summer of 1793. The next summer, 28 July 1794, he was executed by guillotine along with 21 others.\n\nThe play is filled with various speeches on the topic of liberty. The first scene is set in the Tuileries, in which Bertrand Barère, Jean-Lambert Tallien and Louis Legendre, opponents of Robespierre discuss their plans to challenge the \"tyrant\". Their conversation comprises highly rhetorical speeches as if they were part of a public meeting.\n\nThe third act, originally written by Lovell, was rewritten by Southey. Within the act, the opponents of Robespierre compare themselves to the assassins of Julius Caesar who are restoring the republic. In the final speech, Bertrand Barère discusses the history French Revolution and lists the various would-be despots who have attempted to usurp liberty for Louis XVI to Robespierre himself, concluding that France will be a beacon of liberation to the world.\n\nAct one reflects Coleridge's feelings about those Robespierre executed, including Madame Roland and Brissot. The tone of the piece is not revolutionary, but it does include themes connected to his other works and reveals Coleridge's thoughts on marriage, politics, and childhood. It also incorporates Coleridge's view that individuals are naturally innocent in a manner similar to Rousseau's belief. This idea, combined with a belief in achieving some sort of paradise, was developed in the works following the play.\n\nThe play as a whole deals with many Shakespearean themes and emphasises the precedents of both Brutus and Mark Antony throughout. Southey's third act captures his feelings on the French Revolution and incorporates his radical views. The act also contains his feelings on despotism and liberty.\n\nAn anonymous review in the November 1794 \"Critical Review\" argued that the subject matter would have been appropriate for a tragedy but the events happened too soon to allow for it to be dealt with in an appropriate manner. The reviewer also commented on the haste of the work and that it \"must, therefore, not be supposed to smell very strongly of the lamp. However, the review does praise aspects of the poem, as the author writes, \"By these free remarks, we mean not to under-rate Mr. Coleridge's historical drama. It affords ample testimony, that the writer is a genuine votary of the Muse, and several parts of it will afford much pleasure to those who can relish the beauties of poetry. Indeed a writer who could produce so much beauty in so little time, must possess powers that are capable of raising him to a distinguished place among the English poets.\" In the \"British Critic\", an anonymous reviewer argued in 1795 that \"The sentiments ... in many instances are naturally, though boldly conceived, and expressed in language, which gives us reason to think the Author might, after some probation, become no unsuccessful wooer of the tragic muse.\"\n\n\n"}

(The book chapter:verse cites were appended to the model designation, see photo.) The ABC News story was initiated by Michael L. Weinstein and the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, after being alerted to the practice by multiple sources including active duty servicemembers.\n\nTom Munson, director of sales and marketing for Trijicon, said the practice of including the references was started in 1981 by the company's founder, devout Christian Glyn Bindon, who died in a 2003 plane crash.\n\nSome Christian organizations spoke out against the practice.\n\nA spokesman for United States Central Command, which manages military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, opined the inscribed sights do not violate the military's self-imposed ban on proselytizing because there is no effort to distribute the equipment beyond the US troops who use them.\nOn 20 January 2010 the BBC reported that the British Ministry of Defence, which had—when unaware of the issue—recently purchased 480 Trijicon sights for use in Afghanistan, appreciated that the markings could cause offense, and had taken the matter up with the company.\n\nAs news of the inscriptions surfaced, further armed forces became aware of controversial practice. The New Zealand Special Air Service had purchased 260 of the scopes in 2004 and at the time was also unaware of the practice. The New Zealand SAS confirmed they will not stop using the sights as they are considered the best in the world. A New Zealand defence force spokesman was quoted as saying \"We deem them to be inappropriate\", and the NZ Prime Minister, John Key said the government was not aware of the inscriptions when the equipment was purchased, and \"We are in discussions with the company in the United States who will ensure the inscriptions are removed, and we wouldn't want them on future sights\".\n\nOn 22 January 2010, Trijicon announced it would stop the practice of engraving Biblical references on products sold to the government. It also offered to provide modification kits for the purpose of removing such engravings on sights already produced and sold to the military. In a statement, the company said it was both \"prudent and appropriate\" to remove the engravings. Trijicon's consumer products are still engraved with Biblical references in accordance with company tradition.\n\nThe Trijicon serial numbers in question were based off verses relating to illumination.

{"id": "2803287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2803287", "title": "Uli Jon Roth", "text": "Uli Jon Roth\n\nUli Jon Roth (born Ulrich Roth, 18 December 1954) is a German\nguitarist, who became famous as Scorpions' lead guitarist, and is one of the earliest contributors to the neoclassical metal genre. He is also the founder of Sky Academy and inventor of the Sky Guitar. He is the older brother of fellow guitarist and artist Zeno Roth (1956–2018).\n\nIn the early 1970s, Roth formed a band called Dawn Road. In 1973, guitarist Michael Schenker left the Scorpions to join UFO. The two remaining Scorpions members, Rudolf Schenker and Klaus Meine merged with the four members of Dawn Road, (Uli Jon Roth, Achim Kirschning, Francis Buchholz, Jürgen Rosenthal) using the name Scorpions as they were more well known than Dawn Road.\n\nDuring his tenure as lead guitarist, main songwriter and occasional lead singer for the Scorpions, the band released four studio albums between 1974 and 1977. In 1978, the Scorpions released the live album \"Tokyo Tapes\", which was recorded in Japan and sold nearly one million copies and went gold in several countries. However, Roth had left the band in 1978 following the end of the \"Taken by Force\" tour and before the \"Tokyo Tapes\" release.\n\nRoth formed his own band named Electric Sun, which released three albums. The first, \"Earthquake\" (1979), was dedicated to the spirit of Jimi Hendrix. A second album released two years later, \"Fire Wind\" (1981), was dedicated to Anwar Sadat (the assassinated President of Egypt who had tried to make peace in the Middle East), and featured a song called \"Enola Gay (Hiroshima Today?)\" about the atomic bombing of Japan by an airplane of that name.\n\nIn 1985, Roth released his third and final Electric Sun album, \"Beyond the Astral Skies\", dedicated to Martin Luther King and to Roth's fans.\n\nAfter Electric Sun, Roth entered a new phase of creative work, composing four symphonies and two concertos, and sometimes performing with symphony orchestras throughout Europe. Roth used the name \"Uli Jon Roth\" for all subsequent album releases and concert appearances.\n\nThe G3 European tour of 1998 featured Roth playing with Joe Satriani and Michael Schenker. The tour show at London Wembley Arena also featured a jam with Brian May.\n\nRoth played at the outdoor rock festival at Castle Donington in 2001 (also featuring original Scorpions lead guitarist Michael Schenker on the bill), and this was filmed and subsequently released on DVD.\n\nRoth appeared in concert with the Scorpions onstage at the Wacken Open Air Festival in 2006 along with two other former members of the band. Billed as \"A Night To Remember, A Journey Through Time\", the Scorpions played four songs from the Roth era, most of which they hadn’t played live since Roth had left in 1978. The concert was filmed and released on DVD.\n\nAlthough this was meant to be a \"one night only\" special event, its success meant that the format was repeated on several tours afterwards.\n\nOn 2 June 2007 at the Rock am Ring festival in Germany, Roth joined The Smashing Pumpkins on stage for their epic closing song \"Gossamer\". He made another appearance with the Pumpkins upon their return to Germany on 26 February 2008.\n\nIn 2007, Roth had begun working on a new full-length studio album, which was to be released the following year. The title of the album would be \"Under A Dark Sky\" and was going to be the first official release in the long-awaited series of Symphonic Legends – a cycle of music written by Uli for his all-encompassing Sky of Avalon project.\n\nRoth debuted songs from \"Under A Dark Sky\" on 18 July 2008 in his headline set at the G-TARanaki Guitar Festival in New Zealand, Roth's debut concert in the country. In the week previous Roth had taken his \"Sky Academy\" tuition classes to regional Taranaki towns in Waitara, Inglewood and Opunake with guests Vernon Reid and Gilby Clarke.\n\n\"Under A Dark Sky\" was released in Japan on 20 August 2008 via Marquee records. The European and USA releases followed a month later on 20 September 2008 on the SPV record label.\n\nIn early 2015, Uli Jon Roth released a 2-CD studio album entitled \"Scorpions Revisited\" recorded in 2014 in Hannover, Germany, in which Roth revisited his personal favourites from the early Scorpions period. This CD was highly successful and led to a world tour by Uli with a full electric rock band. Following the success of this tour, Uli then led a tour called The Ultimate Guitar Experience with fellow guitarists Jennifer Batten and Andy Timmons. This tour was met by critical acclaim. Seemingly without much rest, Uli soon thereafter embarked on another world tour, this time playing \"The Tokyo Tapes\", songs from the Scorpions 1978 tour of Japan and ensuing live album. In December 2016, a double CD and Blu-ray/DVD were released of a concert Uli and his band played in Japan in 2015 commemorating the anniversary of \"The Tokyo Tapes\". In March, 2017, Roth concluded a short, but very successful North American tour, highlighting songs from both \"Scorpions Revisted\" and \"Tokyo Tapes\".\n\nIn the 1980s, Roth commissioned construction of custom guitars with additional frets from luthier Andreas Demetriou. Roth has had five of these \"Sky\" guitars made. To be able to emulate the high notes of a violin, all of the Sky Guitars contain extra frets. The first Sky Guitar (used on the album \"Beyond the Astral Skies\") has 30 frets. Later versions of the Sky Guitar overcame the problem of the higher register frets becoming too narrow by widening the frets by whole steps for the highest notes. In an April 2001 \"Guitar Player\" magazine interview, Roth reports that the guitars are either fretless above the 30th fret or have whole step fret spacing above the 27th fret, with 35 effective (half step) frets. All of the Sky guitars with frets have scalloped fretboards. The Sky guitar's pickups are custom 4-coil humbuckers made by John Oram, with one guitar having an Oram pickup hidden under the 24th fret. For a time, Roth used a Framus Dragon amplifier, although currently he promotes Blackstar Artisan 100 & Series One 200 Watt heads. He has also used a stalk mounted Vibesware guitar resonator (sustainer) to introduce infinite sustain as on the instrumental Benediction on his \"Under A Dark Sky\" album. In 2011, Dean Guitars produced 25 Custom Sky Guitars based on Roth's custom models, with six and seven strings.\n\nIn Roth's early days with Scorpions, his soloing style was based primarily on the blues scale, occasionally incorporating notes from other modes. However, by the time the band recorded the \"Virgin Killer\" album, he began incorporating more advanced compositional elements from European classical music, such as pedal tone sequences and intricate arpeggios. Beginning with Electric Sun, the classical influence began to dominate his playing style, notable in songs like \"Cast Away Your Chains\" and \"Still So Many Lives Away\". His style eventually became a fusion of blues-based rock with European classical sensibilities. Roth employs major and minor pentatonic, the blues scale, phrygian, harmonic minor, diminished, and the whole tone scale, notably in his famous \"Sails Of Charon\" solo.\n\nRoth was romantically involved with artist Monika Dannemann who was with Jimi Hendrix when he died. Roth and Danneman collaborated on various songs including \"We'll Burn the Sky\" from the Scorpions' \"Taken by Force\" album in 1977.\n\nDanneman also painted the album sleeves for all three of the releases by Electric Sun.\n\nIn 1996 Monika Dannemann was convicted of breaking a British High Court order not to repeat allegations that Kathy Etchingham was an \"inveterate liar\" for accusing her of playing a role in Jimi Hendrix's death. Etchingham asked the judge to jail Dannemann but she was released. Two days later Monika Dannemann was found dead in a fume-filled Mercedes-Benz near her cottage in Seaford, East Sussex, aged 50. Her death was ruled a suicide, but Roth publicly stated his opinion that her death had been the result of foul play. Roth dedicated later works to the memory of Dannemann.\n\nRoth has been living in the UK for several years, his current home (2015) being in Powys, Wales, near the border of Shropshire, England.\n\nUli Jon Roth has been a vegetarian since the Scorpions days.\n\nRoth has been on the covers of many guitar magazines and has influenced many notable guitar players, including Kirk Hammett, Marty Friedman, Yngwie Malmsteen, Joe Stump, Gus G, Andy DiGelsomina, Michael Romeo, James Byrd, Wolf Hoffman, and Hank Shermann of Mercyful Fate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a Grade II listed building, known for its gardens, originally planted by garden designer Gertrude Jekyll, and for the country house opera performed by Woodhouse Opera at the annual Woodhouse Summer Opera Festival.\n\nBuilt in 1926, the house was designed by architect Oliver Hill for the stage and film actor Amy Brandon Thomas and her husband William Deane Barnes-Brand. In 1939 Hill built another house for the couple, Burrows Wood in Gomshall, Surrey, which is also Grade II listed.\n\nWoodhouse Copse is a large cottage orné, originally with a thatched roof, built in brick with weatherboarding and a large, central stone chimney. Hill was influenced by Edwin Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll in his use of local materials and vernacular architecture. However, his almost sculptural shaping of the thatch was distinctive. He built similar houses elsewhere in the 1920s, including at Croyde, Devon and Knowle in the Midlands. Woodhouse Copse also featured timbers retrieved from an old mill at Coulsdon, as commemorated in a verse engraved in 1925 on a window. The central shaft from the mill was incorporated into a spiral staircase. The house's thatch was later removed.\n\nHill laid out the garden with its terraces, drystone walls and circular steps. Over 1926–28, Jekyll drew up planting plans for the flowerbeds, and supplied the plants from her nursery at Munstead Wood, Surrey, where Amy Brandon Thomas was a frequent visitor.\n\nMusical performances are organised by Music at Woodhouse, which is led by Monika Saunders, the house's owner. She converted an indoor swimming pool into a concert room and created a lakeside amphitheatre for opera. Besides the annual opera festival, concerts are held throughout the year. There is a focus on using young performers, including some drawn from the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy of Music.\n\n\n"}

In 2003 it was produced by Terence Frisby at the Criterion Theatre in London.\n\n\"Woza Albert!\" (which means \"Come Albert\") was written by Percy Mtwa, Mbongeni Ngema, and Barney Simon in 1981. In 2002, it was performed in London by Siyabonga Twala and Errol Ndotho.\n\nThe two actors play roles of various black South Africans - a vendor, barber, servant, manual labourer, soldier - receiving the news that Christ (Morena) has arrived in South Africa, where a Calvinist white elite imposes apartheid. Christ's arrival precipitates a crisis, and the government launches a nuclear bomb against the peacemaker. In the ruins, great South African leaders in resistance to apartheid such as Albert Luthuli, former president of the African National Congress, are resurrected. They play dozens of parts that involve them using many skills such as acting, mime, singing and dance. They also create images using a few words and actions.\n\nA film was made under the same title, following the success of the play. A BBC-TV team, led by David M. Thompson, undertook the filming of the movie while in South Africa to film elections in 1981. Equipment was scant, as was time, but nonetheless the film captured the performances that are the core of the film.\n\n"}
