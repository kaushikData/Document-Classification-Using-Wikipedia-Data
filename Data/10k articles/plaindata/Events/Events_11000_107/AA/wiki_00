The film was written, directed and produced by Paul Greengrass and features a Norwegian cast and crew. The film had its world premiere on September 5, 2018 in the main competition section of the 75th Venice International Film Festival. It was released online and in select theaters on October 10, 2018, by Netflix.\n\nAnders Behring Breivik dresses in a police uniform, loads a van with home-made explosives, and drives to Regjeringskvartalet, the executive government quarter in Oslo, Norway. He leaves the van outside the office of Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg. Moments later, it explodes, causing several casualties. \n\nOn the island of Utøya in Tyrifjorden, Buskerud, teenagers have arrived for Workers' Youth League (AUF) summer camp, organised by the ruling Labour Party. When they learn of the bombing, one student, Viljar Hanssen, calls his parents to make sure they are unhurt.\n\nBreivik arrives at the ferry landing and tells staff he is a police officer sent to secure the island following the attack. The camp director transport him to the island by boat. Breivik instructs the staff to gather the children in one location. When the head of security asks for ID, Breivik shoots him and the director dead. The children flee as Breivik opens fire, murdering dozens.\n\nViljar and his brother Torje hide on a rocky embankment on the beach. Viljar calls his mother to tell him a shooting is in progress.

Breivik surrenders to a tactical team and is brought inland for interrogation. \n\nBreivik claims he is the leader of a white nationalist group called the Knight's Templar and that more attacks will happen on his signal. He requests the aid of lawyer Geir Lippestad, who defended a Neo-Nazi. Lippestad is morally conscientious of his client and professionally bonded by his ethics as a lawyer. Lippestad tries to argue an insanity defense for Breivik, which draws criticism as it means he will be institutionalized instead of imprisoned. Breivik tells Lippestad he wants to be declared competent to legitimize his attacks. \n\nViljar wakes from a coma with life-changing injuries. He learns to walk again, but is haunted by memories of the attack. With the support of his mother, and another survivor of the attack on Utøya, he appears in court as a witness and delivers an account of the massacre.

{"id": "40410263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40410263", "title": "Antalas", "text": "Antalas\n\nAntalas (;; c. 500 – after 548) was a Berber tribal leader who played a major role in the wars of the Byzantine Empire against the Berber tribes in Africa. Antalas and his tribe, the Frexenses of Byzacena, initially served the Byzantines as allies, but after 544 switched sides. With the final Byzantine victory in 548, Antalas and his Christian tribe once again became Byzantine subjects. The main sources on his life are the epic poem \"Iohannis\" of Flavius Cresconius Corippus and the \"Histories of the Wars\" of Procopius of Caesarea.\n\nAntalas was born c. 500, and was the son of a certain Guenfan, according to Corippus. He belonged to one of the Berber tribes of Byzacena (central Tunisia), most likely the Christian Frexenses. Corippus reports that Antalas' career began at the age of seventeen, stealing sheep. He soon gathered followers around him and became a brigand, fighting against the Vandals. By 530, he had become leader of the Berbers in Byzacena, and in the same year led them to a decisive victory against the Vandals.\n\nFollowing the Vandalic War (533–534) and the capture of the Vandalic Kingdom by the Byzantine Empire, Antalas became an ally of the empire, receiving subsidies and supplies in exchange. In 543, however, a revolt broke out among the Berbers of Byzacena, which resulted in the execution of his brother Guarizila and the cessation of the subsidies by the Byzantine governor, Solomon. This treatment alienated Antalas, and when the Leuathae rebelled in Tripolitania in the next year, he and his followers joined them. The united tribes inflicted a heavy defeat on the Byzantines in the Battle of Cillium, where Solomon himself was killed.\nWith the death of the capable Solomon, his nephew Sergius, whose arrogant treatment of the Leuathae had prompted their rebellion in the first place, was appointed governor in Africa. Stotzas, a renegade Byzantine soldier who had led an unsuccessful rebellion a few years earlier, now joined Antalas from his refuge in Mauretania. Antalas wrote to the Byzantine emperor, Justinian I, asking for Sergius' dismissal, but in vain. Justinian only dispatched the patrician Areobindus in early 545 to share command with Sergius, but both were militarily incompetent and spent their time bickering with each other. While Sergius remained inactive at Carthage, Antalas and Stotzas led their troops north and managed to trick Himerius, the commander of Hadrumetum, into leaving the town with his troops and rendezvous with another Byzantine commander, John. Himerius fell into the trap, and while his soldiers mutinied and joined Stotzas, he was forced to betray Hadrumetum to save his life. Finally, in late 545 Areobindus ordered the reluctant John to advance and meet the joint army of Antalas and Stotzas, which was encamped at Sicca Veneria. John's troops were considerably outnumbered by the rebel forces, and in the Battle of Thacia his army was routed and he himself was killed, but not before mortally wounding Stotzas in a duel.\n\nAfter the defeat at Thacia, Sergius was relieved and Areobindus replaced him. At this time, the ambitious Byzantine \"dux\" of Numidia, Guntharic contacted the various Berber leaders in a bid to unseat Areobindus. Antalas was promised the rule of Byzacena, half the treasure of Areobindus and 1,500 Byzantine troops as his command. In order to increase pressure on Areobindus, the Berbers and the renegade followers of Stotzas approached Carthage. At the same time, Areobindus himself had secret contacts with another Berber leader, Cutzinas, leader of the Numidian Berbers. Cutzinas had promised to murder Antalas once battle was joined, but Guntharic revealed this plan to Antalas. In the event, due to Areobindus' timidity, a battle did not take place; in March Guntharic seized Carthage and murdered Areobindus.\n\nNow master of Carthage, Guntharic refused to honour his agreement with Antalas, and the latter withdrew his men into Byzacena. There, in an effort to reconcile himself with the emperor, he contacted the \"dux\" of Byzacena, Marcentius, who had fled to an offshore island, proposing to make common cause against Guntharic. Guntharic sent an army under Cutzinas and Artabanes against Antalas and defeated him. Guntharic himself was murdered soon after (May 546) by a conspiracy headed by Artabanes, and Carthage and the army returned to the Empire's allegiance. Justinian now sent an experienced soldier, John Troglita, to impose order on the troubled African provinces. Gathering his forces, Troglita marched out of Carthage into Byzacena. Antalas sent an embassy to the Byzantine general, but the latter rejected his demands and imprisoned the envoys. Shortly after, he sent an emissary of his own, who placed Antalas before the choice of battle or immediate submission. Antalas refused to submit, and the two armies confronted each other somewhere in Byzacena in late 546 or early 547. The battle resulted in a crushing Byzantine victory: the Berbers suffered heavy losses, and the battle-standards lost at Cillium were recovered by the Byzantines.\n\nIn the summer, however, Antalas joined the Berbers of Tripolitania (though he is not mentioned by Corippus, Procopius records his presence) and inflicted a heavy defeat on Troglita at the Battle of Marta. After their victory, the Berbers raided even to the outskirts of Carthage. In the next year, Antalas again joined the Tripolitanian Berbers, under their leader Carcasan, when they invaded Byzacena. In contrast to the impetuous Carcasan, Antalas advocated a more cautious scorched earth tactic when Troglita marched forth to meet them. Nevertheless, when the two adversaries met later in the summer in the Battle of the Fields of Cato, the result was a decisive Byzantine victory: Carcasan fell, and the Berber revolt was crushed as Antalas and the surviving leaders submitted to Troglita. Nothing further is known of him after that.\n\n"}

The music varies to reflect the popular music of the eras depicted.\n\nThe musical first opened Off-Broadway in 1990, and the 2004 Broadway production won five Tony Awards.\n\nAs a panelist at producer Stuart Ostrow's Musical Theater Lab, Sondheim read a script by playwright Charles Gilbert, Jr. Sondheim asked Gilbert for permission to use his idea. Gilbert consented and offered to write the book; but Sondheim declined, having already had collaborator John Weidman in mind. Weidman had written the book for \"Pacific Overtures\" and would work with Sondheim again on \"Road Show\".\n\n\"Assassins\" opened Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons on December 18, 1990, and closed on February 16, 1991 after 73 performances. Directed by Jerry Zaks the cast included Victor Garber, Terrence Mann, Patrick Cassidy, Debra Monk, Greg Germann, and Annie Golden. According to the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The show has been sold out since previews began, reflecting the strong appeal of Sondheim's work among the theater crowd.\" Frank Rich in his \"New York Times\" review wrote \"\"Assassins\" will have to fire with sharper aim and fewer blanks if it is to shoot to kill.\"\n\nOn October 29, 1992, \"Assassins\" opened in London at the Donmar Warehouse with direction by Sam Mendes and a cast that included Henry Goodman as Charles Guiteau and Louise Gold as Sara Jane Moore. The show ran for 76 performances, closing on January 9, 1993.\n\nThe first US regional production was mounted by the San Jose Civic Light Opera in San Jose, California in 1993. This was the world premiere of the 13-piece orchestration by Michael Starobin. Next was the New Line Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri in 1994, and it was re-mounted by that company in 1998 and 2008.\n\nThe first Australian production opened in February 1995, presented by the Melbourne Theatre Company at the Fairfax Studio. Directed by Roger Hodgman, the cast featured John O'May, John McTernan and Bruce Myles.\n\nRoundabout Theater Company's Broadway production was originally scheduled for 2001 but was postponed to April 22, 2004, because the content was sensitive in light of the events of September 11, 2001. After 101 performances at Studio 54, \"Assassins\" closed on July 18, 2004. Directed by Joe Mantello, with musical staging by Jonathan Butterell, Neil Patrick Harris starred in the roles of The Balladeer and Lee Harvey Oswald, with Marc Kudisch in an extended role as The Proprietor. Michael Cerveris played John Wilkes Booth, for which he received a Tony Award. The 2004 production was noted for a \"coup de théâtre\": the Zapruder film of the death of John F. Kennedy projected onto Lee Harvey Oswald's T-shirt by projection designer Elaine J. McCarthy. On 3 December 2012, the Broadway cast reunited for a special benefit. Annaleigh Ashford stood in for Mary Catherine Garrison.\n\nOther professional productions have included a 2006 production at Crucible Theatre, Sheffield, a 2008 production which ran from January 23 to February 2, 2008, at the Landor Theatre, London, The South African premiere opened in December 2008 as the inaugural production of the NewSpace Theatre in Cape Town. This production was directed by Fred Abrahamse with a South African cast including Marcel Meyer as John Wilkes Booth, Riaan Norval as Lee Harvey Oswald, David Dennis as Charles J. Guiteau and Anthea Thompson as Sara Jane Moore. The Los Angeles premiere opened in 1994 at the Los Angeles Theatre Center and included Patrick Cassidy (the original Balladeer) playing Booth, and Alan Safier as Guiteau. A 2010 production in Toronto by BirdLand Theatre and Talk is Free Theatre won the Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding Production in the Musical Theatre Division.\n\nThe Union Theatre, London, produced \"Assassins\" in July 2010, which went on the win Best (overall) Production at The Off West End Awards. It was staged and directed by Michael Strassen. It attained Show of the Week and Critics choice in Time Out.\n\nA new production of \"Assassins\" starring Catherine Tate as Sarah Jane Moore, Aaron Tveit as John Wilkes Booth, and Jamie Parker as the Balladeer opened on November 21, 2014 at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London and ran until March 7, 2015.\n\n\"Assassins\" was produced in the 2017 season of \"Encores! Off Center\" at the New York City Center from July 12–15 of that year, with a cast including Steven Pasquale as John Wilkes Booth, Victoria Clark as Sara Jane Moore, and Shuler Hensley as Leon Czolgosz.\n\nThe three versions (original, London and Broadway) were not identical, as roles were combined, and the song \"Something Just Broke\" was new to the London production. In 1991, Theatre Communications Group published the libretto, which did not feature \"Something Just Broke\".\n\nThe current licensed version of the musical reflects the 2004 Broadway revival. Although the script does not combine The Balladeer and Oswald into a single role, many productions have followed the revival in doing so.\n\nFictional:\n\n\nHistorical:\n\nCasts of Original, Broadway and London productions\n\nThis synopsis reflects the current licensed version of the show. The published script of the 1992 Off-Broadway production is slightly different.\n\nThe play opens in a fairground shooting gallery where, amid flashing lights, human figures trundle past on a conveyor belt. One by one, a collection of misfits enters the stage, where the Proprietor of the game entices them to play, promising that their problems will be solved by killing a President (\"Everybody’s Got the Right\"). Leon Czolgosz, John Hinckley, Charles Guiteau, Giuseppe Zangara, Samuel Byck, Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, and Sara Jane Moore are given their guns one by one. John Wilkes Booth enters last and the Proprietor introduces him to the others as their pioneer before he begins distributing ammunition. The assassins take aim as \"Hail to the Chief\" heralds Abraham Lincoln's offstage arrival. Booth excuses himself, a shot rings out and Booth shouts, \"Sic semper tyrannis!\"\n\nThe Balladeer, a personification of the American Dream, appears and begins to tell John Wilkes Booth's story (\"The Ballad of Booth\"). The scene changes to Richard H. Garrett's barn in 1865. Booth, mudstained and with a broken leg, is attempting to write his reasons for killing Lincoln in his diary but cannot hold the pen. He forces his associate David Herold to write for him at gunpoint. As Booth dictates, blaming Lincoln for the Civil War and for destroying the South, the Balladeer interjects that Booth's motives really had more to do with his personal problems. When a Union soldier calls for Booth's surrender, Herold abandons him and surrenders. In desperation, Booth throws the Balladeer his diary so that he can tell his story to the world. The Balladeer reads out Booth’s justifications, and Booth laments that the act for which he has given up his life will not be enough to heal the country. As the Union soldiers set fire to the barn, Booth commits suicide, and the Balladeer concludes that Booth was a madman whose treacherous legacy only served as inspiration for other madmen like him to damage the country. The Balladeer rips Booth's rationale from his diary and burns the pages.\n\nThe Assassins gather in a bar. Guiteau toasts to the Presidency of the United States, speaking of his ambition to become Ambassador to France. Zangara complains about his stomach pains, and Booth suggests fixing them by shooting Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hinckley accidentally breaks a bottle, and Czolgosz flies into a rage, describing the horrors he sees in the bottle factory he works in, and how many men die or are injured just to make a bottle like the one Hinckley has just broken. Guiteau jokingly tells Czolgosz to find another job, and the two begin to argue about the American Dream, with Guiteau defending America and Czolgosz dismissing the \"land of opportunity\" as a lie. Czolgosz becomes enraged and grabs a bottle, barely stopping himself from throwing it across the room. Booth urges Czolgosz to take control of his fate by breaking a bottle himself, but Czolgosz cannot.\n\nA radio broadcast, narrated by the Proprietor, describes Zangara's failed attempt to assassinate Roosevelt. He misses Roosevelt and accidentally kills Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak instead. Five Bystanders are interviewed in turn, telling the audience their personal versions of the event; each is convinced that he or she personally saved the President (\"How I Saved Roosevelt\"). From an electric chair, Zangara sings his refusal to be afraid and that he hadn't cared whom he killed as long as it was one of the men who control the money. Peeved that as an \"American Nothing\" he has no photographers at his execution, Zangara is electrocuted as the Bystanders preen for the cameras.\n\nAmerican anarchist leader Emma Goldman gives a lecture from offstage as Leon Czolgosz listens, enraptured. He introduces himself to her and declares his love, but she tells him to redirect his passion to the fight for social justice. She gives him a leaflet that she tells him contains an idea that is \"not mine alone, but mine\". As she prepares to leave, Czolgosz offers to carry her bag, to which Goldman protests by saying, \"They make us servants, Leon. We do not make servants of each other.\" Czolgosz, in his first display of assertiveness, still insists.\n\nFromme and Moore meet on a park bench and share a joint. Fromme speaks of the apocalyptic preachings of mass murderer Charles Manson, remembering how they met and declaring herself his lover and slave. Juggling her purse, a can of Tab and a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Moore claims she is an informant for the FBI (or used to be), has been a CPA and had five husbands and three children. They connect over their shared hatred of their fathers, and using Colonel Sanders as a graven image, they give the bucket of chicken the evil eye and then shoot it to pieces while laughing hysterically. Moore realizes that she had known Manson in high school, and the scene ends as the women scream in delight over their memories of the charismatic killer.\n\nCzolgosz reflects on how many men die in the mines, the steel mills and the factories just to make a gun. Booth, Guiteau and Moore enter one by one and join him in a barbershop quartet in which they honor a single gun's power to change the world (\"The Gun Song\"). Czolgosz decides his gun will claim one more victim: the President.\n\nCzolgosz arrives at the 1901 Pan American Exposition and sees that William McKinley is shaking visitors' hands in the Temple of Music Pavilion. The Balladeer sings \"The Ballad of Czolgosz\" as Czolgosz joins the receiving line, and upon reaching McKinley, he shoots him.\n\nSamuel Byck sits on a park bench in a dirty Santa suit with a picket sign and a shopping bag. He talks into a tape recorder, preparing a message to Leonard Bernstein telling Bernstein he can save the world by writing more love songs, and explaining that he is going to change things by crashing a 747 into the White House and killing Richard Nixon. Then he accuses Bernstein of ignoring him, just like the other celebrities he has recorded tapes for, such as Hank Aaron and Jonas Salk. After flying into an expletive-laden rage, Byck stands up on the bench and angrily sings the chorus to \"West Side Story\"s song \"America\" before storming offstage.\n\nJohn Hinckley sits in his rumpus room, aimlessly playing a guitar. Lynette Fromme enters and tries to convince him to play her a song (asking for \"Helter Skelter\"), but he refuses. Fromme notices a picture of Jodie Foster, who Hinckley claims is his girlfriend. When Fromme realizes the picture is a publicity photo from a film, she pulls out a picture of Charles Manson and mocks Hinckley for being in love with a woman he's never met, which makes him throw her out in a fit of rage. Alone, he swears that he will win Foster's love \"with one brave, historic act\" and sings a love song to her while Fromme individually does the same to Manson (\"Unworthy of Your Love\"). An image of Ronald Reagan appears on a wall in the back of the stage, and an enraged Hinckley shoots it over and over again, but the picture keeps reappearing. The Proprietor mocks Hinckley by quoting Reagan's famous quips about the assassination as Hinckley fires and fires, missing each time.\n\nBack at the Proprietor's shooting range, Charles Guiteau flirts with Sara Jane Moore while giving her marksmanship tips before trying to kiss her. When she rebuffs him, he becomes suddenly enraged and attempts to attack her. Her gun goes off in his ear, and he backs off, angrily proclaiming that he is extraordinary and will be the next Ambassador to France. The scene changes to a train station, where Guiteau goes to meet James Garfield. He asks to be made Ambassador to France, but Garfield mockingly refuses, prompting Guiteau to shoot him.\n\nGuiteau is arrested and sent to the gallows, where he recites a poem he wrote that morning titled \"I am Going to the Lordy\". When Guiteau finishes, the Balladeer enters and sings about Guiteau's trial and sentencing while Guiteau merrily cakewalks up to the noose, getting more and more desperately optimistic with each verse. Guiteau sings along with the Balladeer about Guiteau's optimism before he is finally hanged (\"The Ballad of Guiteau\").\n\nSqueaky Fromme and Sara Jane Moore prepare to assassinate Gerald Ford. Moore has brought along her nine-year-old son and her dog (which she accidentally shoots), which causes an argument between the two women, who briefly turn on each other. Moore accidentally spills her gun's bullets just as President Ford enters the stage. Not recognizing him at first, the two women allow him to help them, but upon discovering who he is, Fromme tries to shoot him, but her gun jams. Having no other resource left, Moore tries to throw her bullets at Ford, shouting \"bang\" as she does so.\n\nSamuel Byck is driving to the airport to hijack a plane, which he plans to crash into the White House. Growing completely unhinged, he records a message addressed to Richard Nixon, complaining about contemporary American life, how the American public is constantly lied to, and announces that killing him is the only solution.\n\nThe assassins congregate in the Proprietor's shooting range once again and enumerate their reasons for taking action. Led by Byck, they lament that they haven't gotten the rewards they were \"promised\". The Balladeer tells them that their actions didn't solve their problems or the country's and that if they want their prizes they must follow the American Dream. The assassins realize that they will never get their prizes, that no one will ever care if they live or die, and briefly sink into absolute desperation until Byck and the Proprietor lead them in \"Another National Anthem,\" a song for all Americans dispossessed by the dream. The Balladeer attempts to convince them to be optimistic and seek other ways to be happy, but the Anthem grows louder and louder until the assassins force the Balladeer offstage (in the 2004 revival and many productions that followed, the Assassins all surround the Balladeer, transforming him into Lee Harvey Oswald).\n\nThe scene changes to the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. The ghosts of John Wilkes Booth, Leon Czolgosz, Charles Guiteau, and other \"would be\" assassins including John Hinckley, Arthur Bremer, Sirhan Sirhan and James Earl Ray, appear before a suicidally depressed Lee Harvey Oswald, and convince him that the only way for him to truly connect with his country is to share his pain and disillusionment with it. They slowly and carefully attempt to convince him not to become his own victim and to instead assassinate John F. Kennedy. Booth tells Oswald that by joining them he will finally make a difference, but Oswald refuses. Booth tells him that in the future, when Hinckley’s room is searched, Oswald's biographies will be found. Booth tells Oswald that the key to the future is in his hands. Oswald tries to leave, but Zangara addresses him passionately in Italian, his words translated by the other assassins, imploring him to act so their own acts can come alive again. They tell him that he has the power to cause worldwide grief and inspire global passion about himself, a man the world has never cared or heard about. Calling themselves his family, the assassins sing, imploring Oswald to act. He crouches at the window and shoots (\"November 22, 1963\").\n\nAfter the assassinations, a group of citizens recount what they were doing when they heard that the President had been killed and lament that even though only a single man died, the nation has changed forever (\"Something Just Broke\").\n\nThe assassins regroup once more at the shooting range, now with Oswald among their ranks, and they proudly restate their motto, \"Everybody's got the right to be happy,\" before loading their guns and opening fire on the audience (\"Everybody's Got the Right (Reprise)\").\n\n\n\"Notes:\"\n+ In the original production, the lead part among the Assassins for \"Another National Anthem\" is sung by Byck. However, in the revised 2004 score the lead is sung by the Proprietor.\n\nAdded for the 1992 London producti.\n\nSondheim has said that he expected backlash from the public due to the content. \"There are always people who think that certain subjects are not right for musicals...[w]e're not going to apologize for dealing with such a volatile subject. Nowadays, virtually everything goes,\" he told \"The New York Times\".\n\nBy developing the characters of historic assassins out of the slim biographical information found in the daily news, \"Assassins\" prompts us to consider their motivation. \"(Sondheim) confronts pain in order to cauterize the decay and heal the sicknesses which lurk at the core of our society\". Departing from the humanism of his previous musical \"Into the Woods\", Sondheim suggests that political murderers are a product of the American political culture (Joanne Gordon).\n\nHistorian and commentator Sarah Vowell introduced her 2005 analysis of the Lincoln, McKinley, and Garfield murders, \"Assassination Vacation\", with a journey from New York City into New England to attend a performance of \"Assassins\", the musical prompting her writing of the book.\n\nAlthough \"Assassins\" had not run on Broadway prior to 2004, the 1992 West End production and 1991 Off-Broadway production led to a ruling by the Tony Awards Administration Committee that the musical is a revival instead of an original musical.\n\nRecordings of both the Off-Broadway production and the 2004 revival are commercially available. The Off-Broadway version does not include the song 'Something Just Broke', which was added to the show for the subsequent London production.\n\nWhile the original Off-Broadway production used just three musicians, the original cast recording was fully orchestrated by Michael Starobin, with 33 musicians directed by Paul Gemignani.\n\n\n"}

The term \"Awa Odori\" was not used until the 20th century, but Bon festivities in Tokushima have been famous for their size, exuberance and anarchy since the 16th century.\n\nAwa Odori's independent existence as a huge, citywide dance party is popularly believed to have begun in 1586 when Lord Hachisuka Iemasa, the \"daimyō\" of Awa Province hosted a drunken celebration of the opening of Tokushima Castle. The locals, having consumed a great amount of sake, began to drunkenly weave and stumble back and forth. Others picked up commonly available musical instruments and began to play a simple, rhythmic song, to which the revelers invented lyrics. The lyrics are given in the 'Song' section of this article.\n\nThis version of events is supported by the lyrics of the first verse of \"Awa Yoshikono Bushi\", a local version of a popular folk song which praises Hachisuka Iemasa for giving the people Awa Odori and is quoted in the majority of tourist brochures and websites. However, according to local historian Miyoshi Shoichiro, this story first appeared in a \"Mainichi Shimbun\" newspaper article in 1908 and is unsupported by any concrete evidence. It is unclear whether the song lyrics were written before or after this article appeared.\n\nSome evidence of the festival's history comes from edicts issued by the Tokushima-han feudal administration, such as this one dating from 1671:\n1. The bon-odori may be danced for only three days.2. Samurai are forbidden to attend the public celebration. They may dance on their own premises but must keep the gates shut. No quarrels, arguments or other misbehaviour are allowed.3. The dancing of bon-odori is prohibited in all temple grounds.\nThis suggests that by the 17th century, Awa's bon-odori was well established as a major event, lasting over three days—long enough to be a major disruption to the normal functioning of the city. It implies that samurai joined the festival alongside peasants and merchants, disgracing themselves with brawling and unseemly behaviour. In 1674, it was \"forbidden for dancers or spectators to carry swords (wooden or otherwise), daggers or poles\". In 1685 revelers were prohibited from dancing after midnight and dancers were not allowed to wear any head or face coverings, suggesting that there were some serious public order concerns.\n\nIn the Meiji period (1868–1912) the festival died down as the Tokushima's indigo trade, which had financed the festival, collapsed due to imports of cheaper chemical dyes. The festival was revitalised at the start of the Shōwa period (1926) when Tokushima Prefectural authorities first coined the name \"Awa Odori\" and promoted it as the region's leading tourist attraction.\n\nThe song associated with Awa Odori is called \"Awa Yoshikono\" and is a localised version of the Edo period popular song \"Yoshikono Bushi\". Parts of it are sung, and others are chanted. The origins of the melodic part have been traced to Kumamoto, Kyūshū, but the Awa version came from Ibaraki Prefecture, from where it spread back down to Nagoya and Kansai. The lyrics of the first verse are:\n\n\"Awa no tono sama Hachisuka-sama ga ima ni nokoseshi Awa Odori\"What Awa's Lord Hachisuka left us to the present day is Awa Odori\n\nThe song is usually sung at a point in the parade where the dancers can stop and perform a stationary dance — for example a street intersection or in front of the ticketed, amplified stands which are set up at points around the city. Not every group has a singer, but dancers and musicians will frequently break out into the Awa Yoshikono chant as they parade through the streets:\n\nThe dancers also chant \"hayashi kotoba\" call and response patterns such as \"Yattosa, yattosa\", \"Hayaccha yaccha\", \"Erai yaccha, erai yaccha\", and \"Yoi, yoi, yoi, yoi\". These calls have no semantic meaning but help to encourage the dancers.\n\nDuring the daytime a restrained dance called \"Nagashi\" is performed, but at night the dancers switch to a frenzied dance called \"Zomeki\". As suggested by the lyrics of the chant, spectators are often encouraged to join the dance.\n\nMen and women dance in different styles. For the men’s dance: right foot and right arm forward, touch the ground with toes, then step with right foot crossing over left leg. This is then repeated with the left leg and arm. Whilst doing this, the hands draw triangles in the air with a flick of the wrists, starting at different points. Men dance in a low crouch with knees pointing outwards and arms held above the shoulders.\n\nThe women's dance uses the same basic steps, although the posture is quite different. The restrictive kimono allows only the smallest of steps forward but a crisp kick behind, and the hand gestures are more restrained and graceful, reaching up towards the sky. Women usually dance in tight formation, poised on the ends of their geta sandals.\n\nChildren and adolescents of both sexes usually dance the men's dance. In recent years, it has become more common to see adult women, especially those in their 20s, dancing the men's style of dance.\n\nSome of the larger \"ren\" (dance groups) also have a \"yakko odori\", or kite dance. This usually involves one brightly dressed, acrobatic dancer, darting backwards and forwards, turning cartwheels and somersaults, with freestyle choreography. In some versions, other male dancers crouch down forming a sinuous line representing the string, and a man at the other end mimes controlling the kite.\n\nKōenji, an area of Tokyo, also has an Awa Dance Festival, modeled on Tokushima's, which was started in 1956 by urban migrants from Tokushima Prefecture. It is the second largest Awa Dance Festival in Japan, with an average of 188 groups composed of 12,000 dancers, attracting 1.2 million visitors.\n\nThe Japanese production company Tokyo Story produced a version of Awa Odori in 2015 in Paris by bringing dancers from Japan in order to promote Awa Odori and the Japanese \"matsuri\" culture abroad.\n\n\"Awa dance\" is a 2007 Japanese movie starring Nana Eikura.\nThe festival is also prominently featured in the 2007 movie Bizan starring Matsushima Nanako. Posters representing popular anime characters practicing the Awa dance are also printed every year for the festival. They have featured Fate/stay night for example in 2014.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11949250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11949250", "title": "Battle of Suiyang", "text": "Battle of Suiyang\n\nThe Battle of Suiyang () was a battle in Suiyang during the An Shi Rebellion, between the rebel An Lushan's Yan army and the loyalist forces of the Chinese Tang army. Although the battle was ultimately won by Yan, it suffered a major loss of manpower and time. The battle was noted for Tang army's determination to fight to the last man, and also due to the cannibalism that occurred during the siege.\n\nIn January 757 AD, An Lushan was killed by his own son An Qingxu. In the same month, An Qingxu ordered general Yin Ziqi () to besiege Suiyang. Yin Ziqi joined with Yang Chaozong before the siege, with a total army size over 130,000 men. The governor of Suiyang at the time, Xu Yuan (), heard of Zhang Xun's fortress defence abilities in the Battle of Yongqiu and asked him for help. Zhang Xun knew that if Suiyang fell, the rest of Tang's territory south of the Yangtze River would be threatened. He agreed to help immediately.\n\nThe united army of Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan, around 7,000 men, prepared to defend Suiyang with their lives. Xu Yuan focused on supplies management and after-battle repairs. Zhang Xun, on the other hand, focused on battle tactics.\n\nDespite daily sieges by the Yan army, the Tang soldiers never let up. Zhang Xun's troops played the war-drums during the night, acting as if they were going to fight (a tactic that army apparently had used before). Consequently, the Yan army were forced to stand on guard during the night, and suffered from the lack of sleep. Eventually, some troops did not bother to put on their armor when they heard these battle drums, and kept sleeping. After the Yan army lowered their defenses, Zhang Xun's forces ambushed them very successfully.\n\nZhang Xun had long wanted to give the Yan morale a major blow, and the best way to do this would be to hurt or kill the Yan general Yin Ziqi. However, in an age before photography, the problem was that Zhang had no idea what Yin Ziqi looked like, not to mention he would be in a mix of soldiers. Zhang therefore turned to psychology. He ordered his troops to shoot weeds, instead of arrows, at a few enemy soldiers. When these soldiers noticed that they were being shot by weeds, hence were not killed, they were overjoyed. They promptly ran to Yin Ziqi to report that the Tang army had already run out of arrows. Zhang Xun noticed where the soldiers ran and ordered his best archers to shoot at Yin Ziqi. One such arrow hit Yin Ziqi in his left eye, throwing the Yan army instantly into chaos. The siege ended with the expected major blow to the Yan morale.\n\nAfter 16 days of siege and ambush, Yan had already lost 20,000 men. Yin Ziqi decided that his army was too tired to fight, so he ordered a temporary retreat to regroup. Yin Ziqi returned to besiege Suiyang two months later, with an additional 20,000 fresh troops.\nOriginally, Xu Yuan had prepared for the upcoming battle by storing 1 year of food supply inside of Suiyang. But the district governor had insisted that he share the large food supply with other nearby fortresses, and hence the food supply became much less than what Xu Yuan originally planned. By July, the Tang soldiers had fallen into a serious food shortage. Tang soldiers were given very small daily rations of rice. If they wanted more food, they would need to settle for whatever animals, insects, and tree roots that could be found in their vicinity.\n\nYin Ziqi noticed the famine that was plaguing the Tang army; he therefore ordered more troops to surround Suiyang. He made many siege attempts with siege ladders, but they were all repelled by the determined Tang troops. Yin Ziqi even used hooked pulled carts, to try to pull down the towers of the fortress, with limited success. The Tang soldiers were able to destroy the hook of these carts, before major damage was made. But even with the battle success, Zhang Xun knew that with only around 1,600 soldiers left, and most of them sick or hungry, the battle would soon be a lost cause.\n\nBy August, all of the insects, animals and vegetation in the besieged area had been eaten. Zhang Xun ordered 30 of his best soldiers, including his best soldier captain Nan Jiyun (), to break through and ask for help from nearby fortresses. Nan Jiyun and 26 others successfully broke through. However, none of the nearby local governors were willing to offer troops and food supplies. Finally, Nan Jiyun asked for help from Helan Jinming (), governor of the nearby Linhuai (). Helan had long been jealous of Zhang Xun's abilities. He also wanted to preserve his forces, so he refused to assist Zhang Xun. Instead, he offered Nan Jiyun a large feast, to try to convince him to join his ranks. Nan replied, \"The reason why I risked my life to come here is because the local civilians and my comrades have no food to eat for over a month. How can I eat such a huge feast when I know that my comrades are facing? Although I failed my mission, I will leave a finger with you, as evidence that I did come here.\" Immediately after, Nan Jiyun cut off (or, in some versions, bit off) one of his own fingers. He then rode away.\n\nNan Jiyun's bravery finally convinced a local governor Lian Huan () to lend 3,000 soldiers to him. Both of them fought their way through the Yan ranks back into Suiyang. Fighting through the numerous Yan army was damaging, and only about 1,000 of the soldiers from the outside made it inside the fortress.\n\nThe starving Tang soldiers, numbering about 1,600 in total and with no chance of outside help, fell into despair. Almost everyone tried to convince Zhang Xun to surrender, or find some way of escape south. Zhang Xun and Xu Yuan discussed this, and Xu Yuan concluded, \"If Suiyang falls, Yan will be free to conquer the rest of southern China. And on top of it, most of our soldiers are too tired and hungry to run. The only choice we have left is to defend for as long as possible, and hope that a nearby governor will come and help us.\" Zhang Xun agreed with him. Zhang Xun announced to his remaining troops, \"The nearby governors might be inelegant, but we cannot be disloyal. Another day that we can hold out is another day for the rest of the Tang to prepare defenses. We will fight till the very end.\"\n\nAt this time, besieged Suiyang had long been in a state of famine. The Old Book of Tang says:\n\nYin Ziqi had besieged the city for a long time. The food in the city had run out. The dwellers traded their children to eat and cooked bodies of the dead. Fears were spread and worse situations were expected. At this time, Zhang Xun took his concubine out and killed her in front of his soldiers in order to feed them. He said, \"You have been working hard at protecting this city for the country wholeheartedly. Your loyalty is uncompromised despite the long-lasting hunger. Since I can't cut out my own flesh to feed you, how can I keep this woman and just ignore the dangerous situation?\" All the soldiers cried, and they did not want to eat. Zhang Xun ordered them to eat the flesh. Afterwards, they caught the women in the city. After the women were run out, they turned to old and young males. 20,000 to 30,000 people were eaten. People always remained loyal.\n\nXu Yuan also killed his servants, which was recorded in The New Book of Tang:\n\n...(Xu) Yuan also killed servants to feed the soldiers...\n\nAn explanation for people still staying loyal is accounted in The New Book of Tang:\n\nAfter the city was besieged for a long time, at the beginning, the horses were eaten. After horses ran out, they turned to the women, the old, and the young. 30,000 people in total were eaten. People knew their death was close, and nobody rebelled. When the city fell, only 400 people were left.\n\nIt is possible that all dead soldiers and civilians were also eaten after this incident.\n\nThe Tang soldiers fought bravely until early October. Finally, with fewer than 400 men alive, and the men without the strength to shoot arrows, Suiyang fell to the Yan army. Zhang Xun said before the fall, \"We are out of strength, and can no longer defend the fortress. Although we have failed the emperor in life, we hope to keep killing enemies after death.\"\n\nZhang Xun, Nan Jiyun and Xu Yuan were all captured. Yin Ziqi asked,\"I heard that every time you fight, you open your eyelids until they rip, and you bite your teeth until they crack. Why do you do that?\" Zhang Xun answered, \"I want to eat you traitors alive. The damages to my eyes and teeth are nothing.\" Yin Ziqi used a dagger to hold open Zhang Xun's mouth, and to his surprise, all but three of Zhang Xun's teeth were indeed cracked. Zhang Xun finally said, \"I die for my emperor, so I will die in peace.\"\n\nYin Ziqi admired Zhang Xun's bravery and commanding abilities. But no matter how hard Yin tried to persuade Zhang Xun, Nan Jiyun, and Xu Yuan, they would not join the Yan ranks. At the end, fearing further dangers, Yin killed all 3 men, along with 33 other loyal elite soldiers.\n\nZhang Xun was able to repel many overwhelming Yan attacks, with less than 10,000 soldiers during each battle. Because of Zhang Xun's determination, the resource-laden southern China did not come under threat from the rebels for almost 2 years. With such a large Yan army held at bay, Tang was able to use the resources to gather more troops for combat. This gave Tang enough time to regroup and strike back at Yan.\n\nTo Yan, the losses were enormous, although Yan won this series of battles. Before the Battles of Yongqiu and Suiyang, Yan had intended to conquer all of the Tang Dynasty. Their total army size, across the whole country, was well over 300,000 men, greatly outnumbering what the Tang army could have offered at the time. After these two battles, however, the tide had turned and the Tang army held the upper hand in both manpower and equipment. If Yan had conquered the whole Suiyang district even one year earlier, the Tang Dynasty might have ended by 757AD. The Suiyang campaign marked the turning point of the war.\n\n"}
{"id": "31601107", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31601107", "title": "Bodily integrity", "text": "Bodily integrity\n\nBodily integrity is the inviolability of the physical body and emphasizes the importance of personal autonomy and the self-determination of human beings over their own bodies. In the field of human rights, violation of the bodily integrity of another is regarded as an unethical infringement, intrusive, and possibly criminal.\n\nIt is one of Martha Nussbaum's ten principle capabilities (see capabilities approach). She defines bodily integrity as: \"Being able to move freely from place to place; being able to be secure against violent assault, including sexual assault ... having opportunities for sexual satisfaction and for choice in matters of reproduction\".\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, bodily integrity has been recognised by the courts as an unenumerated right, protected by the general guarantee of \"personal rights\" contained within Article 40 of the Irish constitution. In \"Ryan v Attorney General\" it was pronounced that \"\"you have the right not to have your body or personhood interfered with. This means that the State may not do anything to harm your life or health. If you are in custody, you have a right not to have your health endangered while in prison\". \n\nIn a separate case \"M (Immigration - Rights of Unborn) -v- Minister for Justice and Equality & ors,\" the Irish Supreme Court ruled that the right to bodily integrity extended to the unborn. In a summary of the case in section 5.19, the Supreme Court stated:“…the only right of the unborn child as the Constitution now stands which attracts the entitlement to protection and vindication is that enshrined by the amendments in Article 40.3.3 namely, the right to life or, in other words, the right to be born and, possibly, (and this is a matter for future decision) allied rights such as the right to bodily integrity which are inherent in and inseparable from the right to life itself”.\n\nThe United States Constitution does not contain any specific provisions regarding the rights one has with respect to his or her physical body or the specific extent to which the state can act upon bodies. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld right to privacy, which, as articulated by Julie Lane, often protects rights to bodily integrity. In \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965) the Court supported women's rights to obtain birth control (and thus, retain reproductive autonomy) without marital consent. Similarly, a woman's right to privacy in obtaining abortions was protected by \"Roe v. Wade\" (1973). In \"McFall v. Shimp\" (1978), a Pennsylvania court ruled that a person cannot be forced to donate bone marrow, even if such a donation would save another person's life.\n\nConversely, the Supreme Court has also protected the right of governmental entities to infringe upon bodily integrity. Examples include laws prohibiting the use of drugs, laws prohibiting euthanasia, laws requiring the use of seatbelts and helmets, strip searches of prisoners, and forced blood tests.\n\nIn general, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms defends personal liberty and the right not to be interfered with. However, in certain unique circumstances government may have the right to temporarily override the right to physical integrity in order to preserve the life of the person. Such action can be described using the principle of supported autonomy, a concept that was developed to describe unique situations in mental health (examples include the forced feeding of a person dying from the eating disorder anorexia nervosa, or the temporary treatment of a person living with a psychotic disorder with antipsychotic medication).\n\nOne unique example of a Canadian law that promotes bodily integrity is the Ontario Health Care Consent Act. This Ontario law has to do with the capacity to consent to medical treatment. The HCCA states that a person has the right to consent to or refuse treatment if they have mental capacity. In order to have capacity, a person must have the ability to understand and appreciate the consequences of the treatment decision. The law says that a person is capable with respect to a treatment, admission to a care facility or a personal assistance service if the person is able to \"understand\" and \"appreciate\" the information that is relevant to making such a decision.\n\nTwo key international documents protect these rights: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n\nThe Human Rights and Constitutional Rights project, funded by Columbia Law School, has defined four main areas of potential bodily integrity abuse by governments. These are: Right to Life, Slavery and Forced Labor, Security of One's Person, Torture and Inhumane, Cruel or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\nThough bodily integrity is (according to the capabilities approach) afforded to every human being, women are more often affected in violations of gender-based violence.[citation needed] These include sexual assault, unwanted pregnancy, domestic abuse, and limited access to contraception. These principles were addressed in the CCL Working Conference on Women's Rights as Human Rights. The conference defined bodily integrity as a right deserved by all women: \"bodily integrity unifies women and that no woman can say that it does not apply to them\".\n\nAs defined by the conference participants, the following are bodily integrity rights that should be guaranteed to women:\n\nThe debate over children's rights to bodily integrity has grown in recent years. In the wake of the highly publicized Jerry Sandusky trial, parents have been increasingly encouraged to promote their child's sense of bodily integrity as a method of reducing children's vulnerability to being victims of sexual violence, human trafficking and child prostitution.\n\nMethods of increasing children's sense of bodily autonomy include:\n\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states the following: \"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation\".\n\nActivists who oppose genital modification and mutilation define themselves as intactivists or genital integrity activists (a portmanteau of \"intact\" and \"activist\"), who strive to defend the rights of male, female, and intersex children and babies to keep their sex organs intact, and to prohibit genital mutilation and forced circumcision on children internationally. Various organisations have been set up specifically for the purpose, other organisations have stated their support for the movement. Intactivists consider themselves to be an LGBT social movement, and have participated in LGBT pride parades ever since 2006. In North America, the genital integrity movement primarily focuses on circumcision of male infants and children and to a lesser but still prevalent extent, intersex surgery. Intactivists also promote bodily integrity and tend to have little or no issue with consenting and informed adults undergoing surgery, since their main concern is to secure Children's rights from genital mutilations.\n"}

Activities also encompass procurement of details, and money laundering techniques. Modern carding sites have been described as full-service commercial entities.\n\nThere are a great many of methods to acquire credit card and associated financial and personal data. The earliest known carding methods have also included 'trashing' for financial data, raiding mail boxes and working with insiders. Some bank card numbers can be semi-automatically generated based on known sequences via a 'BIN attack'. Carders might attempt a 'distributed guessing attack' to discover valid numbers by submitting numbers across a high number of ecommerce sites simultaneously.\n\nToday, various methodologies include skimmers at ATMs, hacking an ecommerce or payment processing site or even intercepting card data within a point of sale network. Randomly calling hotel room phones asking guests to 'confirm' credit card details is example of a social engineering attack vector.\n\nStolen data may be bundled as a 'Base' or 'First-hand base' if the seller participated in the theft themselves. Resellers may buy 'packs' of dumps from multiple sources. Ultimately, the data may be sold on darknet markets and other carding sites and forum 'cvv shops' specialising in these types of illegal goods. Teenagers have gotten involved in fraud such as using card details to order pizzas.\n\nOn the more sophisticated of such sites, individual 'dumps' may be purchased by zip code and country so as to avoid alerting banks about their misuse. Automatic checker services perform validation en masse in order to quickly check if a card has yet to be blocked. Sellers will advertise their dump's 'valid rate', based on estimates or checker data. Cards with a greater than 90% valid rate command higher prices. 'Cobs' or changes of billing are highly valued, where sufficient information is captured to allow redirection of the registered card's billing and shipping addresses to one under the carder's control.\n\nFull identity information may be sold as 'Fullz' inclusive of social security number, data of birth and address to perform more lucrative identity theft.\n\nFraudulent vendors are referred to as 'rippers', vendors who take buyer's money then never deliver. This is increasingly mitigated via forum and store based feedback systems as well as through strict site invitation and referral policies.\n\nWhilst some carding forums will exist only on the dark web, today most exist on the internet, and many will use the Cloudflare network protection service.\n\n\"Estimated per card prices, in US$, for stolen payment card data 2015\"\nFunds from stolen cards themselves may be cashed out via buying pre-paid cards, gift cards or through reshipping goods though mules then reselling through online marketplaces like eBay. Increased law enforcement scrutiny over reshipping services has led to the rise of dedicated criminal operations for reshipping stolen goods.\n\nHacked computers may be configured with SOCKS proxy software to optimise acceptance from payment processors.\n\nThe 2004 investigation into the ShadowCrew forum also led to investigations of the online payment service E-gold that had been launched in 1996, one of the preferred money transfer systems of carders at the time. In December 2005 its owner Douglas Jackson's house and businesses were raided as a part of 'Operation Goldwire'. Jackson discovered that the service had become a bank and transfer system to the criminal underworld. Pressured to disclose ongoing records disclosed to law enforcement, many arrests were made through to 2007. However, in April 2007 Jackson himself was indicted for money laundering, conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. This led to the service freezing the assets of users in 'high risk' countries and coming under more traditional financial regulation.\n\nSince 2006, Liberty Reserve had become a popular service for cybercriminals. When it was seized in May 2013 by the US government, this caused a major disruption to the cybercrime ecosystem.\n\nToday, some carders prefer to make payment between themselves with bitcoin, as well as traditional wire services such as Western Union, MoneyGram or the Russian WebMoney service.\n\nMany forums also provide related computer crime services such as phishing kits, malware and spam lists. They may also act as a distribution point for the latest fraud tutorials either for free or commercially. ICQ was at one point the instant messenger of choice due to its anonymity as well as MSN clients modified to use PGP. Carding related sites may be hosted on botnet based fast flux web hosting for resilience against law enforcement action.\n\nOther account types like PayPal, Uber, Netflix and loyalty card points may be sold alongside card details. Logins to many sites may also be sold such a site backdoor access apparently for major institutions such as banks, universities and even industrial control systems.\n\nFor gift card fraud, retailers are prone to be exploited by fraudsters in their attempts to steal gift cards via bot technology or through stolen credit card information. In the context of carding fraud, using stolen credit card data to purchase gift cards is becoming an increasingly common money laundering tactic. Another way gift card fraud occurs is when a retailer's online systems which store gift card data undergo brute force attacks from automated bots. \n\nTax refund fraud is an increasingly popular method of using identify theft to acquire prepaid cards ready for immediate cash out. Popular coupons may be counterfeited and sold also.\n\nPersonal information and even medical records are sometimes available. Theft and gift card fraud may operated entirely independently of online carding operations.\n\nCashing out in gift cards is very common as well, as \"discounted gift cards\" can be found for sale anywhere, making it an easy sale for a carder, and a very lucrative operation.\n\nThe google hacks popularly known as Google dorks for credit card details are also used vastly in geting credit card details\n\nSince the 1980s in the days of the dial-up BBSes, the term \"carding\" has been used to describe the practices surrounding credit card fraud. Methods such as 'trashing', raiding mail boxes and working with insiders at stores were cited as effective ways of acquiring card details. Use of drops at places like abandoned houses and apartments or with persuadable neighbors near such a location were suggested. Social engineering of mail order sales representatives are suggested in order to provide passable information for card not present transactions. Characters such as 'The Video Vindicator' would write extensive guides on 'Carding Across America', burglary, fax fraud, supporting phreaking, and advanced techniques for maximizing profits. During the 1980s the majority of hacker arrests were attributable to carding-related activities due to the relative maturity of financial laws compared to emerging computer regulations.\n\nStarted in 1989, by 1990 Operation Sundevil was launched by the United States Secret Service to crack down on use of BBS groups involved in credit card fraud and other illegal computer activities, the most highly publicised action by the US federal government against hackers at the time. The severity of the crack down was so much that the Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in response to the violation of civil liberties.\n\nIn the mid-1990s with the rise of AOL dial-up accounts, the AOHell software became a popular tool for phishing and stealing information such as credit card details from new Internet users. Such abuse was exacerbated because prior to 1995 AOL did not validate subscription credit card numbers on account creation. Abuse was so common AOL added \"no one working at AOL will ask for your password or billing information\" to all instant messenger communications. Only by 1997 when warez and phishing were pushed off the service did these types of attacks begin to decline.\n\nDecember 1999 featured an unusual case of extortion when Maxim, a Russian 19-year-old, stole the 25,000 users' card details from CD Universe and demanded $100,000 for its destruction. When the ransom was not paid, the information was leaked on the Internet.\n\nOne of the first books written about carding, \"100% Internet Credit Card Fraud Protected\", featured content produced by 'Hawk' of carding group 'Universal Carders'. It described the spring 1999 hack and credit card theft on CyberCash, the stratification of carder proficiencies (script kiddie through to professionals) common purchases for each type and basic phishing schemes to acquire credit card data.\n\nBy 1999, United States offline and online credit card fraud annual losses were estimated at between $500,000 and $2 million.\n\nFrom the early 2000s, sites like 'The Counterfeit Library', also functioning as a diploma mill, grew to prominence, with many of its members going on to join larger cybercrime websites in later years until its closure around September 2004.\n\nIn 2001 Russian speaking hackers founded CarderPlanet in Odessa which would go on to be one of the most notorious forums of its kind.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, separate US secret service and FBI investigations led to the arrest the top administrator Albert Gonzalez of the large ShadowCrew carding forums, turned informant as a part of 'Operation Firewall'. By March 2004, the administrator of 'CarderPlanet' disappeared with Gonzalez taking over. In October 2004 dozens of ShadowCrew members were busted across the US and Canada. Carder's speculate that one of the USSS infiltrators might have been detected by a fellow site member causing the operation to be expedited. Ultimately, the closure of ShadowCrew and CarderPlanet did not reduce the degree of fraud and led to the proliferation of smaller sites.\n\nShadowCrew admin Brett Shannon Johnson managed to avoid being arrested at this time, but was picked up in 2005 on separate charges then turned informant. Continuing to commit tax fraud as an informant, 'Operation Anglerphish' embedded him as admins on both ScandinavianCarding and CardersMarket. When his continued carding activities were exposed as a part of a separate investigation in 2006, he briefly went on the run before being caught for good in August of that year.\n\nIn June 2005 the credit card processing company CardSystems was hacked in what was at the time the largest personal information breach in history with many of the stolen information making its way to carding sites. Later in 2007 the TJX Companies breach perpetuated by Albert Gonzalez (who was still an informant at the time) would only come to the public's attention after stolen cards detected being misused to buy large amounts of gift cards. Gonzalez's 2008, intrusion into Heartland Payment Systems to steal card data was characterized as the largest ever criminal breach of card data.\n\nAlso in June 2005, UK-based carders were found to be collaborating with Russian mafia and arrested as a result of a National Hi-Tech Crime Unit investigation, looking into Eastern European crime syndicates.\n\nSome time in 2005, J. Keith Mularski from the National Cyber-Forensics & Training Alliance headed up a sting into popular English language site DarkMarket.ws. One of the few survivors of 'Operation Firewall', Mularski was able to infiltrate the site via taking over the handle 'Master Splyntr', an Eastern European spammer named Pavel Kaminski. In late 2006 the site was hacked by Max Butler, who detected user 'Master Splyntr' had logged in from the NCFTA's offices, but the warning was dismissed as inter-forum rivalry. In 2007 details of the operation was revealed to German national police, that the NCFTA had successfully penetrated the forum's inner 'family'. By October 4, 2007 Mularski announced he was shutting the site due to unwanted attention from a fellow administrator, framed as 'too much attention' from law enforcement. For several years following site closure multiple arrests were made internationally.\n\nFrom 2004 through to 2006, CardersMarket assimilated various rival forums through marketing, hacking databases. Arrested in 2007, in 2010 the site's owner Max Butler was sentenced to 13 years in prison.\n\nSince 2007 to present, Operation Open Market, an operation run by the HIS and the USSS has targeted the primarily Russian language Carder.su organisation, believed to be operating out of Las Vegas. In 2011, alleged site owner Roman Seleznev was apprehended in the Maldives by US law enforcement and in 2012, identity thief David Ray Camez was arrested and charged in an unprecedented use of RICO legislation.\n\nHorohorin Vladislav, identified as BadB in November 2009 in a sealed indictment from the United States attorney’s office was arrested in 2010 by USSS in Nice, France. Vladislav created first fully automated credit card shop and managed websites associates with stolen credit card numbers. Horohorin Vladislav is also known for being first cyber criminal to promote his illegal activities by creating video cartoons ridiculing American card holders.\n\nIn 2011, former Bulgarian ShadowCrew member Aleksi Kolarov (also known as 'APK') was finally arrested and held in Paraguay before being extradited to the United States in 2013 to face charges.\n\nIn June 2012, the FBI seized carding and hacking forums UGNazi.com and Carders.org in a sting as a part of a 2-year investigation dubbed Operation Card Shop after setting up a honeypot forum at carderprofit.cc.\n\nIn August 2013, hacker and carding forum HackBB was taken down as part of the raid on Freedom Hosting.\n\nIn January 2014, fakeplastic.net was closed following an investigation by the US postal service and FBI, after collating previously seized information from TorMail, ShadowCrew and Liberty Reserve. This led to multiple arrests and prosecutions as well as the site's closure.\n\nA 2014 report from Group-IB suggested that Russian cybercriminals could be making as much as $680 million a year based on their market research.\n\nIn December 2014 the Tor based Tor Carding Forum closed following a site hack, with its administrator 'Verto' directing users to migrate to the Evolution darknet market's forums which would go on to be the largest darknet market exit scam ever seen.\n\n'Alpha02', who was notorious for his carding guides, went on to found the AlphaBay darknet market, the first to ever deal in stolen Uber accounts. The site is working on rebuilding the damage to the reputation of markets founded by carders precipitated by the Evolution scam. Meanwhile, most Russian carders selling details do not trust the darknet markets due to the high level of law enforcement attention; however, buyers are more open.\n\nErcan Findikoğlu, also known as \"Segate\" and \"Predator\", with others, led an international conspiracy, stole $55 million by hacking ATM card issuers and making fraudulent cards and was sentenced to eight years in prison by a federal court.\n\nFindikoğlu, a Turkish national, with a Russian wife, Alena Kovalenko, avoided capture by obscuring his cyber fingerprints and avoiding the reach of American law, but he went to Germany in December 2013, was arrested, lost a court challenge, was extradited. Findikoğlu, as a youngster honed his skills in cyber cafes, the Turkish military, and then masterminded three complex, global financial crimes by hacking into credit card processors, eliminating the limits on prepaid cards then sending PINs and access codes to teams of cashers who, within hours withdrew cash from ATMs. In December 2012, 5,000 cashers in 20 countries withdrew $5 million, $400,000 in 700 transactions from 140 New York ATMs, in 150 minutes. Stolen cash was kicked back via wire transfers and deliveries to Turkey, Romania and Ukraine.\n\nVladimir Drinkman, 34, a cohort of Albert Gonzalez, pleaded guilty in Camden, New Jersey, that he got credit card numbers from Heartland Payment Systems, 7-Eleven, Hannaford Bros, Nasdaq, Carrefour, JetBlue, and other companies from 2005 to 2012. (U.S. v. Drinkman, 09-cr-00626, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Camden))\n\nIn February 2018, the Infraud Organization was revealed.\nIn more recent years, Russian language forums have gained dominance over English language ones, with the former considerably more adept at identifying security researchers and counterintelligence activities and strict invitation systems. Russia's lack of extradition treaty with the United States has made the country somewhat of a safe haven of cyber criminals, with the Russian foreign ministry going so far as to recommend citizens not travel abroad to countries with such treaties. Investigative journalist Brian Krebs has extensively reported on Russian carders as an ongoing game of cat and mouse.\n\n\n\n"}

An earlier version was first introduced as Bill C-195 by then Minister of Justice Pierre Trudeau in the second session of the 27th Canadian Parliament on December 21, 1967. Bill C-195 was modified and re-introduced as Bill C-150 by then Minister of Justice John Turner in the first session of the 28th Canadian Parliament on December 19, 1968. On May 14, 1969, after heated debates, Bill C-150 passed third reading in the House of Commons by a vote of 149 (119 Liberals, 18 New Democrats, 12 Progressive Conservatives) to 55 (43 Progressive Conservatives, 11 \"Créditistes\", 1 Liberal). The bill was a massive 126-page, 120-clause amendment to the criminal law and criminal procedure of Canada.\n\nThe bill decriminalised homosexuality and allowed abortion under certain conditions. A related bill, introduced and passed at the same time, decriminalised the sale of contraceptives. The Act also regulated lotteries, tightened the rules for gun possession and introduced new offences relating to drinking and driving, harassing phone calls, misleading advertising and cruelty to animals.\n\nJohn Turner, Trudeau's successor as Minister of Justice, described the bill as \"the most important and all-embracing reform of the criminal and penal law ever attempted at one time in this country.\" Trudeau famously defended the bill by telling reporters that \"there's no place for the state in the bedrooms of the nation\", adding that \"what's done in private between adults doesn't concern the Criminal Code\". The \"Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968–69\" is known in French under the title \"Loi de 1968–69 modifiant le droit pénal\".\n\nBill C-150 legalized therapeutic abortion under certain conditions. Abortion was previously a criminal offence in Canada, which was still largely influenced by the Catholic Church's moral positions on this issue. Bill C-150 made it legal for women to get an abortion if a therapeutic abortion committee of three doctors felt the pregnancy endangered the mental, emotional or physical well-being of the mother. In a 1999 speech celebrating the 30th anniversary of the bill's passage, Senator Lucie Pépin argued that the new freedom provided by Bill C-150 \"proved to be a stepping stone for many other freedoms and options that have altered women's place in [Canadian] society — self-esteem, education, jobs, a voice and empowerment\". Abortion legislation in Canada was further liberalized in 1988 with the \"R. v. Morgentaler\" ruling, which left Canada without any laws regulating abortion through all nine months of pregnancy.\n\nPrior to 1968, the Criminal Code made it an offence to offer to sell, advertise, or have in one's possession for the purpose of sale any \"medicine, drug, or article intended or represented as a method of preventing conception or causing abortion or miscarriage.\" As part of the package of reforms contained in the \"Criminal Law Amendment Act,\" the government also introduced Bill S-15, which decriminalised contraceptives and brought them under the regulatory power of the \"Food and Drugs Act\", which governs medicines and medicinal devices. Bill S-15 repealed the reference to contraceptives in the Criminal Code, but left abortifacients criminalised. Bill S-15 received royal assent on June 27, 1969, the same day as the \"Criminal Law Amendment Act\".\n\nBill C-150, decriminalized homosexual acts between men over the age of consent of 21. The British Parliament's adoption of the Sexual Offences Act 1967, influenced Trudeau's decision to include amendments to the Criminal Code concerning homosexuality in Bill C-150. Opposition to homosexuality was so intense that the Catholic \"Créditistes\" of Quebec held up debate for three weeks. The \"Créditistes\" suggested that communism, socialism and atheism were behind the proposed changes relating to homosexuality and abortion; they demanded that a public referendum be held on these issues and staged a filibuster of Parliament over the amendments concerning abortion.\n\nPrior to Bill C-150, Criminal Code exemptions that permitted small scale gambling on behalf of charities were introduced. Between 1892 and 1969, Canadians could wager on horse races or gamble at summer fair midways. These charitable experiences with gambling eventually led Bill C-150 to give the provincial and federal governments the opportunity to use lotteries to fund worthwhile activities (e.g. 1976 Montreal Olympics).\n\nGun politics in Canada were also affected by Bill C-150, which for the first time made it illegal to provide firearms to persons of \"unsound mind\" or criminals under prohibition orders. The law also expanded the definition of a \"firearm\", which, prior to 1969, included only handguns and automatic firearms, and introduced non-restricted, restricted, and prohibited firearm categories.\n\nBill C-150 also addressed the issue of drunk driving. The bill made it an offence to drive with a blood alcohol content (BAC) in excess of 80 mg/100 ml of blood. Refusal of a police officer's demand to provide a breath sample was made an offence at the same time and both began as summary conviction offences, with a mandatory minimum $50 fine.\n"}

According to his own statements, Granados kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered at least 8-10 young women, but according to the Attorney General of the State of Chihuahua they murdered at least 14 women. This corresponded to the 8 corpses found in cotton fields in the city's outskirts and 6 more found in Mount \"Cerro Negro\", also adjacent to the city.\nGranados was an assiduous consumer of cocaine, had a long criminal record in the United States, consisting mainly of low-impact crimes such as illegal entry and residence in the country and consumption and possession of illicit substances; there are records that indicate that Francisco's first arrest was made in 1995, when he was 16 years old, on charges of illegal stay in the country and resisting arrest.\n\nIn 2003, he was detained by the police in El Paso, Texas, the Texas Ranger Division, under the charge of illegal stay in the country.\nWhile in the custody of the Texas police in 2006, Granados confessed to having participated in at least 10 murders of women, perpetrated between 1993 and 2003.

{"id": "822350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=822350", "title": "Feralia", "text": "Feralia\n\nFerālia was an ancient Roman public festival celebrating the Manes (Roman spirits of the dead, particularly the souls of deceased individuals) which fell on 21 February as recorded by Ovid in Book II of his \"Fasti\". This day marked the end of Parentalia, a nine-day festival (13–21 February) honoring the dead ancestors.\n\nRoman citizens were instructed to bring offerings to the tombs of their dead ancestors which consisted of at least \"an arrangement of wreaths, a sprinkling of grain and a bit of salt, bread soaked in wine and violets scattered about.\" Additional offerings were permitted, however the dead were appeased with just the aforementioned. These simple offerings to the dead were perhaps introduced into the Latium by Aeneas, who poured wine and scattered violet flowers on Anchises' tomb. Ovid tells of a time when Romans, in the midst of war, neglected Feralia, which prompted the spirits of the departed to rise from their graves in anger, howling and roaming the streets. After this event, tribute to the tombs were then made and the ghastly hauntings ceased. To indicate public mourning, marriages of any kind were prohibited on the Feralia, and Ovid urged mothers, brides, and widows to refrain from lighting their wedding torches. Magistrates stopped wearing their insignia and any worship of the gods was prohibited as it \"should be hidden behind closed temple doors; no incense on the altar, no fire on the hearth.\"\n\nAs concerns public rites nothing of them survives, however on this day as described by Ovid, an old drunken woman (\"anus ebria\") sits in a circle with other girls performing rites in the name of the mute goddess Tacita who is identified with the nymph Lara or Larunda. The ritual consists of the old woman placing three bits of incense, with three of her fingers, beneath a threshold where a mouse is unknowingly buried. She then rolls seven black beans in her mouth, and smears the head of a fish with pitch, impaling it with a bronze needle, and roasting it in a fire. After she formally declaims the purpose of her actions, as customary in Greco-Roman magic ritual, saying, \"I have gagged spiteful tongues and muzzled unfriendly mouths\" (\"Hostiles linguas inimicaque uinximus ora\"), she departs intoxicated. The use of the black beans in the old woman's ritual may be related to rites that lend themselves to another festival of the dead in the month of May, called Lemuria. During Lemuria the dead ancestor spirits, particularly the unburied, called lemures, emerge from their graves and visit the homes in which they had lived. It was then necessary to confront the unwelcome spirits and lure them out of one's house using specific actions and chants. According to Ovid, this includes the involvement of black beans to lure a spirit out of the home. \"And after washing his (the householder) hands clean in spring water, he turns, and first he receives black beans and throws them away with face averted; but while he throws them, he says: 'These I cast; with these beans I redeem me and mine.' This he says nine times, without looking back: the shade is thought to gather the beans, and to follow unseen behind. Again he touches water, and clashes Temesan bronze, and asks the shade to go out of his house. When he has said nine times, 'Ghosts of my fathers, go forth!' he looks back, and thinks that he has duly performed the sacred rites.\" Perhaps the black beans carried with them connotations of warding away or dispelling bad things in general, whether it be unwelcome spirits haunting a household as seen during Lemuria, or preventing undesired gossip towards an individual as in the old hag's ritual during Feralia. Also, in the context of sacrifices, the black beans are similar to the black animals used in sacrifice to the 'chthonic deities'.\n\nIt is implied through Ovid's choice of words, \"hostiles linguas\" and \"inimicaque ora\", that the ritual is intended to curb gossip about a girl's reputation. Gossip of such a nature and its consequences are the subject for the cause, which Ovid offers, of the Dea Tacita festival, which was held on the same day as the Feralia. Ovid then tells a story to explain the origins of Dea Tacitia, starting with Jupiter's untamed lust for the nymph Juturna. Juturna, aware of Jupiter's lust for her, hid within the Hazelwood forest and dove into her sisters' waters. Jupiter then gathered all the nymphs in Latium seeking their help in capturing Juturna, saying, \"Your sister is spiting herself by shunning her own advantage, an entanglement with the highest god. Look out for us both. What will be a great pleasure for me will be in your sister's great interest. Block her as she flees at the bank of the river to keep her from jumping into its waters.\" One of the informed nymphs, Lara, could not hold her tongue and warned Juturna to flee. In addition, she approached Jupiter's wife Juno, saying, \"Your husband loves the Naiad Juturna.\" As a result, Jupiter rips out Lara's tongue in anger and summons Mercury to escort her to be a nymph in the Underworld. During this mission, Mercury becomes lustful of Lara and rapes her, begetting twins. These twins become the Lares, the guardians of intersections who watch over the city of Rome.\n\n\n"}

Evading a manhunt by the FBI and Honduran police and with a $25,000 bounty on his head, Hahneman went on the run for 28 days before finally surrendering to the US Embassy in Tegucigalpa. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for aircraft hijacking, kidnapping and extortion, serving 12 years.\n\nSpeculation still surrounds Hahneman's motives for the crime.\n\nHahneman was born in Puerto Castilla, Honduras, to a Honduran mother, Delia Pastore Ordóñez, and an American father, the late William Frederick Hahneman, of San Francisco. It is not known when he was naturalized but he had lived in Easton, Pennsylvania, since 1960. He was an engineer and married to Mary Jane Hahneman. They had two sons. Neighbours of the couple told investigators later that Hahneman was a \"mystery\" to them and that Mary, going blind, raised the children alone.\n\nThe period 1967–1972 saw a spate of aircraft hijackings in the United States and worldwide. There had been 26 attempted hijackings in 1971 alone, 11 of them successful. So common were they that the May 8 \"Evening Chronicle\" editorial of 1972 stated, \"They often command little more than one-column, six-paragraph stories on page 8 of most daily newspapers.\"\n\nThe hijackings were a mixture of terrorism and crime for profit. The most infamous of these hijackings is arguably that of D. B. Cooper, which occurred just six months prior to Hahneman boarding Flight 175.\n\nOn May 2, 1972 Hahneman checked into the Americus hotel in Allentown as a well dressed businessman under the assumed name George Ames. Staff remembered him as \"polite\" but got the impression that Ames had \"put up a wall around himself\". After asking directions to a travel agent, staff later reported Ames saying he was \"going to take a plane\" later that morning.\n\nOn the morning of May 5 at Lehigh Valley International Airport (known at the time as Allentown–Bethlehem–Easton International Airport), Hahneman managed to board Eastern Airlines Flight 175, a Boeing 727 jet, armed with a handgun. Shortly after take-off, Hahneman threatened the crew and informed the pilot, Captain W.L. Hendershott, that he was taking over the plane and wanted $303,000 from the airline.\n\nWhile the captain informed the 48 passengers that \"there is an armed man aboard\", Hahneman held the chief stewardess hostage at the rear of the plane. One of the passengers, \"New York Times\" reporter Neil Amdur, wrote later, \"From the moment the captain uttered those chilling words...I felt a sense of fear I had never known.\"\n\nThe captain would later tell FBI investigators that Hahneman \"talked like there was another country and he wanted the money for a cause.\"\n\nTwo other passengers, Frank Valek, a safety inspector for Western Electric, and Robert Palazzo, the mayor of Columbia, N.J., both found Hahneman's gun pressed into their stomachs as they went to the rest room and magazine rack, respectively. Other passengers prayed.\n\nFlight 175 was scheduled to land at Washington's National Airport but Hahneman ordered the captain to land at Dulles International Airport. He did so at 11:15am. No passengers were allowed to leave the plane while Eastern Airlines worked to meet Hahneman's demands. These were $303,000 in cash, six parachutes, two bush knives, two jump suits, two crash helmets, fuel, food and two cartons of his favourite Benson and Hedges cigarettes.\n\nSatisfied that his demands had been met, at 1:13pm Hahneman allowed the passengers to disembark one by one, including one stewardess. The rest of the 6 crew he kept hostage and ordered the captain to take off again at 1:50pm. Soon after becoming airborne Hahneman decided he didn't like the $100 bill denominations given to him by Eastern. He ordered the plane to return to Dulles and demanded the money in larger bills. It took Eastern four hours to comply with this difficult demand, with some of the bills being flown in from Miami.\n\nSatisfied once again, Hahneman ordered the captain to take off and fly to the Central American republic of Honduras, his country of birth. However, en route the plane's hydraulic pump developed a problem and the captain told Hahneman they had to divert to New Orleans. Hahneman was angry and when they landed in New Orleans he demanded another plane from Eastern. When it was ready he put a noose around Captain Hendershott's neck and forced the crew out at gunpoint, using them as a human shield to get safely onto the new plane.\n\nThe remainder of Flight 175 passed without incident and on May 6, around 4am, over the pitch dark Honduran jungle, Hahneman ordered the captain to slow the plane's airspeed. He put on one of the parachutes he'd demanded and opened the rear door. Clutching his money-filled attache case, Frederick Hahneman jumped from the aft airstair into the dense undergrowth below, and disappeared.\n\nIn the US the story faded from the news but in Honduras, Hahneman was on the run from the FBI and the Honduran police. He moved around between friends and family, trying to stay one step ahead. Eastern Airlines put up a $25,000 reward for his capture leading to a tip off that Hahneman was still in Honduras. With his picture now everywhere in Honduras and exposure close, Hahneman sought refuge with his old friend and fellow engineer, José Gómez Rovelo.\n\nOn June 1, Acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray III obtained a warrant in the US District Court of Alexandria, Va., for Hahneman's arrest. The FBI had put together biographical information Hahneman had let slip to the crew during their 20-hour ordeal, with a photograph they possessed, to identify Hahneman as their prime suspect. They said Hahneman's movements in rural Honduras had been tracked by the Honduran police.\n\nWith the net closing, Rovelo convinced Hahneman that he was too old to be on the run. Hahneman agreed. At 1am on June 2, Hahneman and Rovelo walked into the US embassy in Tegucigalpa and Hahneman surrendered.\n\nHahneman was in custody but the money was not. He told authorities that he had deposited the ransom in \"the Chinese Communist Bank in Hong Kong\", via a mysterious Panamanian \"contact\".\n\nOn September 11, 1972, Hahneman waived his right to a jury trial and plead guilty to a charge of air piracy, kidnapping and extortion. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on September 29, 1972 in the US District Court in Alexandria, Va, and sent to the federal prison in Atlanta.\n\nAs he left the federal building for prison, Hahneman was asked by a reporter what he'd done with the money. \"None of your bloody business,\" he replied.\n\nOn May 8, 1973 the FBI announced they had recovered the $303,000 ransom. In the press release they said, \"Upon recovery of the money a check was made of the National Crime Information Center, FBI Headquarters, Washington D.C., which determined the serial numbers tallied with the ransom money paid in connection with the hijacking.\" They provided no further details of how or where they recovered the money.\n\nBureau of Prisons records show Frederick Hahneman was paroled on March 13, 1984. On August 17, 1984 he was discharged. The Bureau has no further records of him.\n\nHahneman's arrest reignited interest in the case and his quiet Easton neighbourhood was alive with agents and reporters asking questions. His blind wife and his sons' lives were spread across the local press. Fed by the FBI's reluctance to reveal details of how and where they recovered the money, along with Hahneman's political claims while in custody and the statement from the captain, there was much speculation about Hahneman's frequent foreign trips, rumours that he'd deposited the $303,000 in a communist bank, and claims that Hahneman and his cousin Roberto Martínez Ordóñez, a delegate with the Honduran mission to the United Nations, were plotting a revolution in Honduras.\n\nMary Hahneman maintained that she had no contact with her husband and didn't even know he'd been released. Asked after his 1984 discharge, she said, \"I still don't know why he did it. If you ever find out, will you please tell me?\"\n\n"}

{"id": "49099215", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49099215", "title": "Hairspray Live!", "text": "Hairspray Live!\n\nHairspray Live! is a television special that aired live on NBC on December 7, 2016. Produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, and hosted by Darren Criss, it is a performance of a new adaptation of the 2002 Broadway musical \"Hairspray\".\n\n\"Hairspray Live!\" takes place in 1962 Baltimore. Teenager Tracy Turnblad’s dream is to dance on The Corny Collins Show, a local TV program. When, against all odds, Tracy wins a role on the show, she becomes a celebrity overnight and meets a colorful array of characters, including Link, the resident dreamboat; Amber, the ambitious mean girl; Seaweed, an African-American boy she meets in detention; and his mother, Motormouth Maybelle, owner of a local record store. Tracy’s mother is the indomitable Edna Turnblad, and she eventually encourages Tracy on her campaign to integrate the all-white Corny Collins Show.\"\n\nMain Cast\n\nMinor Roles\n\nCouncil Members\n\nThe Dynamites\n\nMotormouth Kids\n\nVarious Ensemble\n\nCameos\n\nThe musical numbers from the track list of the soundtrack.\n\n\"Hairspray Live!\" served as NBC's fourth entry in its series of made-for-TV musical telecasts, behind \"The Wiz Live!\", \"Peter Pan Live!\", and \"The Sound of Music Live!\". As with its predecessors, it was executive produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron. The project was revealed by NBC's entertainment head Bob Greenblatt during a Television Critics Association press tour in January 2016. In response to early reports that NBC was considering a live version of \"The Music Man\", \"West Side Story\" or \"Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella\", Greenblatt stated that \"people have been saying to me since \"The Wiz\", 'Do this show, do that show.' I've heard obscure titles and famous titles. Not everything's going to be a big name to the whole audience. I don’t think there's an infinite number of these that can be done. But we're still doing it.\" He explained that the production would not try to emulate the 2007 film (also produced by Zadan and Meron), but that he would have been thrilled if John Travolta reprised his role in it.\n\nKenny Leon returned in his role as director from \"The Wiz\", and was joined by Alex Rudzinski—who co-directed \"\" for Fox. The musical was adapted for television by Harvey Fierstein from the original book by Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan. Jerry Mitchell, the choreographer of the Broadway version of \"Hairspray\", was also involved with the adaptation. In contrast to NBC's previous musicals, \"Hairspray Live!\" was produced from the Universal Studios backlot; Greenblatt explained that a \"fair amount\" of the show would be staged in outdoor settings, and thus \"have a real exuberance in the open air.\" Additionally, live audiences were integrated into relevant scenes as extras on-stage, such as bystanders in Baltimore, and as the studio audience of \"The Corny Collins Show\". Two numbers written for the 2007 film, \"Ladies' Choice” and \"Come So Far (Got So Far to Go)\", were incorporated into the production. \"The Big Dollhouse\", from the Broadway show, was cut, while \"The New Girl In Town\", written for the stage show but cut and only used in the film, was not added. (An instrumental version of the song is, however, heard very briefly as a bit of background music.)\n\nIn addition to adapting the book, Fierstein reprised his performance of Edna Turnblad from the Broadway musical; Greenblatt felt that his performance of Edna was \"iconic\", and that his involvement with \"Hairspray Live!\" made it \"come full circle\". NBC cast the lead role of Tracy Turnblad through an open call in New York City, hoping to repeat the \"phenomenal discovery\" of Shanice Williams for \"The Wiz\". The role went to college sophomore Maddie Baillio, as her first professional role. In November 2016, it was announced that Ricki Lake and Marissa Jaret Winokur (who portrayed Tracy Turnblad in the 1988 film and the Broadway version respectively) would make cameo appearances; Winokur and Lake appeared as employees of Mr. Pinky's boutique. Darren Criss served as an on-air host, hosting a half-hour \"Countdown to Hairspray Live!\" show on NBC with Kristin Chenoweth and Sean Hayes, as well as behind-the-scenes reports throughout the live broadcast.\n\nOreo, Reddi-wip, and Toyota broadcast live, themed commercials during \"Hairspray Live!\"; Oreo's ad featured the character of Corny Collins, Reddi-wip's ad featured a milkman character (Evan Strand) backstage and performing a dance number, while Toyota's ad featured a vintage Toyota Corolla and a current model in celebration of the vehicle's 50th anniversary.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the special holds a 79% rating based on 24 reviews, with an average of 8.2/10. The site's consensus states: \"\"Hairspray Live!\" shimmers with outstanding performances, an engaging story, and songs that let its stars shine.\" It has a score of 66 from 14 critics on Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" reviewer wrote: \"NBC lassoed some talented performers with fine singing voices but sacrificed cohesion by cramming the evening with too much interstitial fluff... Only Jennifer Hudson, who played Motormouth Maybelle, found the real strength of this Tony-winning musical, delivering a knockout rendition of 'I Know Where I've Been'...\" He noted that Baillio \"did pretty well, though no novice is going to compete with voices like those of Ms. Hudson and Kristin Chenoweth...\"\n\nThe \"Variety\" reviewer wrote that it \"took a few musical numbers to settle into a rhythm. But once it did (the energy seemed to kick in with \"Welcome to the ‘60s\") the musical easily became the best NBC has attempted. It's hard to imagine better casting for the production. Jennifer Hudson stole the show... Ariana Grande, certifiable pop star, came away as the show's MVP, acting as both reliably overlook-able sidekick and, once the situation required it, showstopping diva. Harvey Fierstein was predictably great... Martin Short... found the right profile for himself as Wilbur.\"\n\nThe TV Ratings Guide reviewer wrote that the production \"was truly a great experience through and through.\" They praised the entire cast, stating \"the casting was just top notch\", and praised Grande and Hudson in particular. They named 'You Can't Stop the Beat' the best musical moment of the night and stated that \"they really knocked it out of the park.\" They stated that \"NBC really put together something amazing here.\" \n\nThe A.V. Club's reviewer wrote that \"As a piece of social commentary, tonight’s production of Hairspray Live! was just about flawless.\" They stated that Dove Cameron and Ephraim Sykes were \"consistently fun to watch\", and that Chenoweth and Hudson \"were the biggest scene-stealers.\" They said that Fierstein, Short, and Martin \"were all wonderful as well.\" They rated the telecast a B+.\n\n\"Hairspray Live!\" was seen by 9.05 million viewers, with a ratings share of 2.3 in the 18–49 demographic, and a 5.9 overnight household rating. It was the most-viewed program of the night, with numbers on par with those of \"Peter Pan\". An encore presentation, which aired on December 27, was seen by 2.5 million viewers.\n\n\n"}

Goffin and King wrote the song after discovering that their babysitter and singer Little Eva was being regularly beaten by her boyfriend. When they inquired why she tolerated such treatment, Eva replied, with complete sincerity, that her boyfriend's actions were motivated by his love for her.\n\nPhil Spector's arrangement was ominous and ambiguous.\n\nUpon its initial release, \"He Hit Me\" received some airplay, but then there was a widespread protest of the song, with many concluding that the song was an endorsement of spousal abuse. Soon, the song was played only rarely on the radio, as now.\n\nThe 1930 Frank Borzage film \"Liliom\" contains the line \"He hit me and it felt like a kiss\" in its final scene. The film was not a success and nothing suggests that Goffin or King had seen it. \"Liliom\", originally a play by Hungarian playwright Ferenc Molnár, was the basis for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical classic, \"Carousel\". While King and Goffin may not have seen \"Liliom\", it is possible that they were familiar with the successful 1956 film version of \"Carousel\", which contains essentially the same line. However, King has stated that their friend who inspired the song had used that exact phrase.\n\nCarole King, in that same radio interview, said that she was sorry she had ever had anything to do with the song. She was a survivor of repeated domestic abuse (but not from Goffin, who had been her husband from 1959 to 1969).\n\n\n"}

Aimed at 16- to 18-year-olds, the IAI School explored topics such as Free Will and Politics, Sex Ethics and Morality.\n\nHTLGI 2014 attracted a footfall of over 35,000 across 450 events. Speakers and performers included Roger Penrose, Brooke Magnanti, Bruce Parry, Doon Mackichan, Cory Doctorow, Owen Jones, David Nutt, Molotov Jukebox, Moulettes, Natalie Bennett and Mr Scruff.\n\nThe 2012 festival sought to question existing notions of progress through an exploration of issues surrounding political, economic and ethical advance in the West. By acknowledging the uncertainty of the future and its values, do we need to establish new ideas of progress or is such a suggestion inherently flawed?\n\nIt was held in Hay-on-Wye and ran between 31 May and 10 June 2012. The festival staged almost five hundred sessions across the site’s five venues.\n\nAmongst the speakers on the festival’s programme were musician Brian Eno, founder of Glastonbury festival Michael Eavis, literary theorist and critic Terry Eagleton and independent scientist and inventor James Lovelock. Musical highlights included performances from Charlotte Church, Emmy the Great, and Jeffrey Lewis and the Junkyard, as well as a twelve-hour painting marathon from artist Stella Vine to accompany a performance by alternative rock band The Chapman Family.\n\nLondon's Open Gallery, an institution dedicated to the medium of video painting, also staged a series works by filmmaker Roz Mortimer entitled, ‘Sites of Memory’.\n\nThe 2011 festival questioned whether the great narratives that have built and sustained the West are under threat and, if so, what are the new gods that will replace them?\n\nSpeakers at the festival included critical theorist Leela Gandhi, Times columnist David Aaronovitch, poet Simon Armitage, New Statesman culture editor Jonathan Derbyshire and screenwriter Jez Butterworth.\n\nCultural highlights ranged from Ghostpoet, Mount Kimbie and The Correspondents, to comedy and the screening of documentaries from around the world with BBC Four.\n\nThe 2010 festival posed the questions: What is it to be alive? What is essential to our humanity and what is peripheral? What is truly important in life?\n\nAuthor of Politics of Fear Frank Furedi, filmmaker David Bond, author Philip Pullman and Labour politician Jon Cruddas, were amongst the speakers on the line up.\n\nThe Open Gallery explored the boundary between the human and the natural. The Wellcome Trust Identity Project presented an exhibition and two days of events on the topic of Identity. Notably, The School of Life hosted a series of philosophy breakfasts with leading thinkers over the 10-day festival.\n\nRadio 1’s Huw Stephens and John Rostron, the duo behind the Sŵn Festival, curated a night of cutting-edge music, which was accompanied by live performances from Johnny Flynn, Cate le Bon and Radio 1’s Bethan Elfyn.\n\n"}

Such information may be gathered by a military intelligence, government intelligence, or commercial intelligence network.\n\nIntelligence assessment employs intelligence analysis to refine information. Foreign embassies subscribe to the newspapers and keep tabs on the news channels of their host countries — the information doesn't have to be classified to be considered useful intelligence; indeed, so-called OSINT, or open-source intelligence, is increasing in both quantity and utility with the ascendancy of digital media. Researchers may also be employed to dig through archives and check facts. An important form of intelligence is so-called \"signals intelligence\", which attempts to intercept electronic communications and other signals sent between parties working for a hostile, or potentially hostile, entity, or between neutral or even friendly parties but \"discussing\" that entity.\n\nIn established intelligence agencies, such networks usually follow a linear rather than distributed structure. An agent handler directs the activities of a number of persons and sources in order to obtain the necessary facts about the target of the intelligence gathering operation. The two main HUMINT agent types used are \"infiltration\" and \"penetration\" agents. An infiltration agent is someone who enters the target of the operation from the outside, but on a suitable pretext so that they are not suspected of espionage. A penetration agent would already be in place in the target area, and is recruited by the handler, often by means of the MICE principle. The information so gathered is processed by one or more analysts and turned into an intelligence product. Information is conveyed between nodes of the network by a variety of secure/clandestine means, be they physical or electronic.\n\nAt the turn of the twentieth century, the last Sultan, Abdul Hamid II, demanded daily intelligence reports called djournals (from the word \"journal). After decades, he had saved millions of them in \"a whole building to itself in the War Office, where a Government Commission is now,\" Francis McCullagh wrote in 1910, \"wading slowly through this amazing accumulation.\"\n\n"}

The current full title is the Elsa Wells International Dance Championships, and includes all categories in Standard and Latin American ballroom dance.\n\nThe series of Latin American International Championships were started once the initial choreography, teaching and adjudications standards for these dances were stabilised. This occurred in the 1950s, after a period of debate and discussion initiated by Monsieur Pierre and his associates. Although English in origin and organisation, the championships were open to the world, as is the case today for all the major ballroom championships held in England. There are two main series, one for professionals, and another for amateurs, plus various age-limited categories. The division between amateur and professional has persisted in ballroom dance long after it disappeared in most other sports and pastimes.\n\nThe final stages for both Amateur and Professional Standard and Latin American titles are always held at the Albert Hall in London. Qualification for these final stages, and the championships for other categories (Juvenile, Under 14, Junior, Under 21, Senior, Pro Rising Stars) are held at a preliminary two-day event before the main finals at Brentwood, Essex. Non-English adjudicators are always included in the adjudication panels. It is one of the largest regular, and genuinely international, events in the ballroom dance world.\n\nThis list (and competition) is not the same as the later WDC World Championships. The International Professional Latin and Standard Championships are now part of the World Dance Council's \"World Super Series\".\n\nThe Latin American competition comprises five dances: cha-cha-cha, samba, rumba, paso doble, and jive, conducted in line with British Dance Council (BDC) regulations; the basis of the dances is described in standard texts. Advanced choreography has, however, broken through the traditional limitations of social dancing, and more obviously in the Latin and American dances than in ballroom (Modern or Standard).\n\nThe qualifying and lesser events days at Brentwood had, in 2009, three adjudication panels of eight former champions and other significant professionals. Early rounds had one panel of eight, alternating. Semi-finals and finals of lesser events had both panels. At the Albert Hall, there were four panels, each of 19 adjudicators. The semi-finals and finals of the amateur and professional titles were each adjudicated by a separate panel. This may be contrasted favourably with the number of judges used for those Olympic Games events which depend upon adjudication, such as ice dancing and diving. Results and adjudication details (marks for each finalist by each adjudicator) are posted after the event.\n\nIn the Professional Championship there were 150 couples from 34 countries of affiliation (countries of origin not listed). In the Amateur Championship there were 289 couples from 31 countries of affiliation. Countries such as China, Japan, Russia and Italy sent multiple entries to all competitions. The countries listed in the table below are countries of \"origin\", where known.\n"}

The tour is the duo's first tour in 10 years, the last being the \"Power to Change Tour\" in 2000. The duo states this is the final farewell tour for the group. The tour began November 2010 and ended in December. In 2011, the duo announced a second United States leg for the summer of 2011. The tour predominately visited the United States.\n\nThe duo stated that the purpose for the tour was to reconnect with their fans. The tour's title was suggested by fans on Wynonna's website, as the duo had to come up with a name. Naomi Judd remarked \"[I] was going to suggest 'The Cougar Tour'.\" They were joined on tour by the Palmetto State Quartet.\n\nIn 2009, the duo performed together for the first time in nine years the 2009 CMA Music Festival at LP Field. The performance spaced media outlets within the country music scene to hint to a reunion of the duo to be as early as 2010. During the summer of 2009, the duo made rare concert appearances together, including a stop at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut. The duo also opened a museum in Franklin, Tennessee, to commemorate their 25 years in country music. In the course of an interview for \"Billboard\", Wynonna Judd stated the duo was open to perform on tour and recording new music in 2010. She continued, \"It's 2010. It's been 25 years. It's take your mother to work year. It just feels like it's the right time\". Judd wanted to bring her mother, Naomi Judd along for her annual \"Classic Christmas Tour\", however Naomi declined.\n\nThe tour was officially announced in February 2010. The duo would later headline the 2010 CMA Music Festival. At the press conference following the event, the duo remark the audience response for their 2009 show encouraged them to go on this trek one final time. Naomi stated her woman's intuition have her the courage to get back on stage and concert promoters assured her there was a demand for the tour. Also, the duo announced their first reality television series entitled \"The Judds\", to air on OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network. The show will follow the duo's tour, while showing their mother-daughter relationship in both a public and private scope. To promote the tour, the duo appeared on \"Larry King Live\", \"The Early Show\", \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", \"Weekend Edition\" and \"Crook & Chase\", while gracing the covers of \"Country Weekly\" and \"People: Country Special\".\n\nTo introduce the tour, the duo stated: \"[Wynonna] This tour gives me a chance to enjoy where Mom and I are in our relationship. I look forward to celebrating our personal and professional journey…together. [Naomi] There is nothing like music and laughter to connect people. How I've missed that encounter with the very ones who've allowed us that awesome privilege! I'm counting the days till I can be back on my bus, visiting their towns.\"\n\n\n\nOverall, the tour received praise from both music critics and its spectators. Jon Bream (\"Star Tribune\") notes despite Wynonna's vocal problems, the duo were still able to pull off a fantastic show at the sold out Mystic Showroom. He elaborates, \"As Wynonna handed lead vocal chores to her backup singers, it seemed appropriate—for more reasons than one—that the Judds ended their Last Encore show with \"Silent Night\"\". Gary Budzak (\"The Columbus Dispatch\") called the evening a success for the Columbus audience. He states, \"On more than 30 songs that spanned a quarter-century, The Judds have proved they still had the wherewithal to charm the crowd, whether it was Wynonna hugging a 4-year-old girl on stage; or Naomi kissing her husband, bass singer Larry Strickland, on a cover of \"Don't Be Cruel\"\".\n\nThe praise continued with Kevin C. Johnson (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"). The concert at the Family Arena served as a fitting finale for the duo. He explains, \"This is The Last Encore tour, positioned as the final go-round for country music's most successful mother-daughter duo, which doesn't bode well for future Juddheads. Then again, we've already learned final doesn't always mean the end when it comes to the Judds, so time will tell\". At the EnergySolutions Arena, Tom Wharton (\"The Salt Lake Tribune\") says that the Judds were \"going out in styles\". He further comments, \"The pair utilized a video screen behind them for retrospective moments, showing family photos and highlights from their career, as well as two big screens on either side of the stage that allowed an appreciative crowd of about 5,000 a chance to enjoy closeup views of the performers\".\n\nAt the ARCO Arena, Carla Meyer (\"The Sacramento Bee\") notes The Judds provided an intimate show, reminding the audience of the \"good ol' days\" She continues, \"But the familiarity goes beyond song. Naomi, 64, and Wynonna, 46, long ago charmed and confided their ways into fans' hearts by publicly discussing their health woes, tricky family dynamics and Wynonna's weight battles and bad luck with men. Whether through their many appearances on \"Oprah\" or osmosis, you feel like you know them\".\n"}

{"id": "1395969", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1395969", "title": "Lohri", "text": "Lohri\n\nLohri is a popular winter time Punjabi folk festival, celebrated primarily by Sikhs and Hindus from the Punjab region of Indian subcontinent. The significance and legends about the Lohri festival are many and these link the festival to the Punjab region. Many people believe the festival commemorates the passing of the winter solstice. Lohri marks the end of winter season, and is a traditional welcome of longer days and sun's journey to the northern hemisphere by Sikhs and Hindus in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. It is observed the night before Makar Sankranti, also known as Maghi, and according to the solar part of the lunisolar Bikrami calendar and typically falls about the same date every year (January 13).\n\nLohri is an official gazetted holiday in the state of Punjab (India), where the festival is celebrated by Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Christians, but it is not a holiday in Punjab (Pakistan). It is, however, observed by Sikhs and some Punjabi Muslims and Christians in Pakistan as well.\n\nLohri is linked to the Bikrami calendar, and is celebrated the day before the festival of Maghi celebrated in India as Makar Sankranti. Lohri falls in the month of Paush and is set by the solar part of the lunisolar Punjabi calendar and in most years it falls on 13 January of the Gregorian calendar.\n\nThere are many folklores about Lohri. Lohri is the celebration of the arrival of longer days after the winter solstice. According to folklore, in ancient times Lohri was celebrated at the end of the traditional month when winter solstice occurs. It celebrates the days getting longer as the sun proceeds on its northward journey. The day after Lohri is celebrated as Maghi Sangrand.\n\nIn its origins, Lohri is an ancient mid winter Hindu festival, in regions near the Himalayan mountains where winter is colder than the rest of the subcontinent. Hindus traditionally lit bonfires in their yards after the weeks of the \"rabi\" season cropping work, socialized around the fire, sang and danced together as they marked the end of winter and the onset of longer days. After the night of bonfire celebrations, the Hindu would mark Makar Sankranti and go to a sacred water body such as a river or lake to bathe.\nHowever, instead of celebrating Lohri on the eve of when winter solstice actually occurs, Punjabis celebrate it on the last day of the month during which winter solstice takes place. Lohri commemorates the passing of the winter solstice.\n\nThe ancient significance of the festival is both as a winter crop season celebration and a remembrance of the Sun deity (\"Surya\"). Lohri songs mention the Indian Sun god asking for heat and thanking him for his return. Other legends explain the celebration as a folk reverence for fire (\"Agni\") or the goddess of Lohri.\n\nYet another folklore links Lohri to the tale of Dulla Bhatti. The central theme of many Lohri songs is the legend of Dulla Bhatti, whose real name was Abdullah Bhatti and lived in Punjab during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar. He was regarded as a hero in Punjab, for rescuing Hindu girls from being forcibly taken to be sold in slave market of the Middle East. Amongst those he saved were two girls Sundri & Mundri, who gradually became a theme of Punjab' folklore. As a part of Lohri celebrations, children go around homes singing the traditional folk songs of Lohri with \"Dulla Bhatti\" name included. One person sings, while others end each line with a loud \"Ho!\" sung in unison. After the song ends, the adult of the home is expected to give snacks and money to the singing troupe of youngsters.\n\nLohri is celebrated with a bonfire. The lighting of bonfire during this winter festival is an ancient tradition.\nIn Punjab, the harvest festival Lohri is marked by eating sheaves of roasted corn from the new harvest. The January sugarcane harvest is celebrated in the Lohri festival. Sugarcane products such as gurh and gachak are central to Lohri celebrations, as are nuts which are harvested in January. The other important food item of Lohri is radish which can be harvested between October and January. Mustard greens are cultivated mainly in the winter months because the crop is suitable to the agro-climatic conditions. Accordingly, mustard greens are also a winter produce. It is traditional to eat Gajak, Sarson da saag with Makki di roti, radish, ground nuts and jaggery. It is also traditional to eat \"til rice\" which is made by mixing jaggery, sesame seeds and rice. In some places, this dish is called 'Tricholi.'\n\nIn various places of the Punjab, about 10 to 15 days before Lohri, groups of young and teenage boys and girls go around the neighbourhood collecting logs for the Lohri bonfire. In some places, they also collect items such as grains and jaggery which are sold and the sale proceeds are divided amongst the group.\n\nA popular activity engaged in by boys is to select a group member to smear his face with ash and tie a rope around his waist! The idea is for the selected person to act as a deterrent for people who refrain from giving Lohri items. The boys will sing Lohri songs asking for Lohri items. If not enough is given, the householder will be given an ultimatum to either give more or the rope will be loosened. If not enough is given, then the boy who has his face smeared will try to enter the house and smash clay pots or the clay stove!\n\nDuring the day, children go from door to door singing folk songs. These children are given sweets and savories, and occasionally, money. Turning them back empty-handed is regarded inauspicious. Where families are welcoming newly-weds and new borns, the requests for treats increases.\n\nThe collections gathered by the children are known as \"Lohri\" and consist of til, gachchak, crystal sugar, gur (jaggery), moongphali (peanuts) and phuliya or popcorn. Lohri is then distributed at night during the festival. Till, peanuts, popcorn and other food items are also thrown into the fire. For some, throwing food into the fire represents the burning of the old year and start the next year on Makar Sankranti\n\nThe bonfire ceremony differs depending on the location in Punjab. In some parts, a small image of the folk Lohri goddess is made with gobar (cattle dung) decorating it, kindling a fire beneath it and chanting its praises. The folk Lohri goddess is believed to be an ancient aspect of the celebration, and is part of a long tradition of Winter solstice celebrations manifesting as a god or goddess. In other parts, the Lohri fire consists of cow dung and wood with no reference to the Lohri goddess.\n\nThe bonfire is lit at sunset in the main village square. People toss sesame seeds, gur, sugar-candy and \"rewaries\" on the bonfire, sit around it, sing and dance till the fire dies out. Some people perform a prayer and go around the fire. This is to show respect to the natural element of fire, a tradition common in winter solstice celebrations. It is traditional to offer guests til, gachchak, gur, moongphali (peanuts) and phuliya or popcorn. Milk and water is also poured around the bonfire by Hindus to thank the Sun God and seeking his continued protection.\n\nAmong some sections of the Sindhi community, the festival is traditionally celebrated as Lal Loi. On the day of Lal Loee children bring wood sticks from their grand parents and aunties and light a fire burning the sticks in the night with people enjoying, dancing and playing around the fire. The festival is gaining popularity amongst other Sindhis where Lohri is not a traditional festival.\n\nHistorically, during the 19th century, revenue for winter crops was collected either on Lohri or Maghi.\n\nLohri is celebrated to denote the last of the coldest days of winter. Apart from Punjab, Lohri is also celebrated in Delhi. Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. Lohri has been celebrated in Jammu since Mughal times. The festival is observed as Lal Loi in the Sindhi community.\n\nIn houses that have recently had a marriage or childbirth, Lohri celebrations will reach a higher pitch of excitement. Punjabis usually have private Lohri celebrations, in their houses. Lohri rituals are performed, with the accompaniment of special Lohri songs.\n\nSinging and dancing form an intrinsic part of the celebrations. People wear their brightest clothes and come to dance the bhangra and gidda to the beat of the dhol. Punjabi songs are sung, and everybody rejoices. Sarson da saag and makki di roti is usually served as the main course at a Lohri dinner. Lohri is a great occasion that holds great importance for farmers. However, people residing in urban areas also celebrate Lohri, as this festival provides the opportunity to interact with family and friends.\n\nThere are many Lohri songs. For example, the following song which has words to express gratitude to Dulla Bhatti (the 'ho's are in chorus):\nSunder mundriye ho!<br>\nTera kaun vicharaa ho!<br>\nDullah Bhatti walla ho!<br>\nDullhe di dhee vyayae ho!<br>\nSer shakkar payee ho!<br>\nKudi da laal pathaka ho!<br>\nKudi da saalu paata ho!<br>\nSalu kaun samete!<br>\nChacha gali dese!<br>\nChache choori kutti! zamidara lutti!<br>\nZamindaar sudhaye!<br>\nBum Bum bhole aaye!<br>\nEk bhola reh gaya!<br>\nSipahee far ke lai gaya!<br>\nSipahee ne mari itt!<br>\nBhaanvey ro te bhaanvey pitt!<br>\nSanoo de de Lohri, te teri jeeve jodi!<br>\n(Laugh, cry or howl!)<br>\nTranslation\nBeautiful girl<br>\nWho will think about you<br>\nDulla of the Bhatti clan will<br>\nDulla's daughter got married<br>\nHe gave one ser of sugar!<br>\nThe girl is wearing a red suit!<br>\nBut her shawl is torn!<br>\nWho will stitch her shawl?!<br>\nThe uncle made choori!<br>\nThe landlords looted it!<br>\nLandlords are beaten up!<br>\nLots of simple-headed boys came!<br>\nOne simpleton got left behind!<br>\nThe soldier arrested him!<br>\nThe soldier hit him with a brick!<br>\n(Cry or howl)!<br>\nGive us Lohri, long live your pair (to a married couple)!<br>\nWhether you cry, or bang your head later! <br>\nSome people believe that Lohri has derived its name from Loi, the wife of Saint Kabir. There is a legend amongst some people that Lohri comes from the word 'loh', which means the light and the warmness of fire. Lohri is also called lohi in rural Punjab. According to another legend Holika and Lohri were sisters. While the former perished in the Holi fire, the latter survived with Prahlad. Eating of til (sesame seeds) and rorhi is considered to be essential on Lohri day. Perhaps the words til and rorhi merged to become tilorhi, which eventually got shortened to Lohri.\n\nLohri coincides with the festivals of Pongal, Bhogali Bihu and Bhogi.\n\nThe day preceding Pongal in Tamil Nadu and Makara Sankranti in Andhra Pradesh is called Bhogi(భోగి) this is when people discard old and derelict things and concentrate on new things causing change or transformation. At dawn people light a bonfire with logs of wood, other solid-fuels and wooden furniture at home that are no longer useful. The disposal of derelict things is where all old habits, vices, attachment to relations and material things are sacrificed in the sacrificial fire of the knowledge of Rudra, known as the \"Rudra Gita Gyana Yagya\". It represents realization, transformation and purification of the soul by imbibing and inculcating divine virtues.\n\nWinter solstice festivals have been incorporated into other festivals which are celebrated in various regions around the world. The festival of Yule is observed during Christmas celebrations whereby a log is burnt to commemorate the winter solstice.\n\nThe festival of Hogmanay is celebrated on new year’s day. The fire festival of Stonehaven in Scotland is the direct descendant of lighting winter solstice bonfires. Another event is observed every 11 January when the flaming Clavie (a barrel full of staves) is carried round in Burghead and is wedged on the Doorie Hill. When it is burnt out, people take the smouldering embers to bring good luck for the coming year.\n\n"}

When her body was found in the Hudson River, she was assumed to have been the victim of gang violence. However, one witness swore that she was dumped after a failed abortion attempt, while her boyfriend's suicide-note suggested possible involvement on his part. Rogers' death remains unexplained. She inspired Edgar Allan Poe's pioneering detective story \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\".\n\nMary Rogers was probably born in 1820 in Lyme, Connecticut, though her birth records have not survived. She was a beautiful young woman who grew up as the only child of her widowed mother. At the age of twenty, Mary lived in the boarding house that was run by her mother, although it was her amazing beauty that made her the talk of the neighborhood. Her father died in a steamboat explosion when she was 17 years old and she took a job as a clerk in a tobacco shop owned by John Anderson in New York City. Anderson paid her a generous wage in part because her physical attractiveness brought in many customers. One customer wrote that he spent an entire afternoon at the store only to exchange \"teasing glances\" with her. Another admirer published a poem in the \"New York Herald\" referring to her heaven-like smile and her star-like eyes. Some of her customers included notable literary figures James Fenimore Cooper, Washington Irving, and Fitz-Greene Halleck.\n\nOn October 5, 1838, the newspaper New York \"Sun\" reported that \"Miss Mary Cecilia Rogers\" had disappeared from her home. Her mother, Phoebe, said she found a suicide note which the local coroner analyzed and said revealed a \"fixed and unalterable determination to destroy herself\". The next day, however, the \"Times and Commercial Intelligence\" reported that the disappearance was a hoax and that Rogers only went to visit a friend in Brooklyn. The \"Sun\" had previously published a story known as the Great Moon Hoax in 1835, causing controversy. Some suggested this return was actually the hoax, evidenced by Rogers's failure to return to work immediately. When she finally resumed working at the tobacco shop, one newspaper suggested the whole event was a publicity stunt managed by Anderson.\n\nOn July 25, 1841, Rogers told her fiancé, Daniel Payne, that she would be visiting her aunt and other family members. Three days later, on July 28, the police found her corpse floating in the Hudson River in Hoboken, New Jersey. Referred to as the \"Beautiful Cigar Girl\", the mystery of her death was sensationalized by newspapers and received national attention. The details of the case suggested she was murdered, or dumped by abortionist Madame Restell after a failed procedure. Months later, the inquest still ongoing, her grief-stricken fiancé Daniel Payne committed suicide by overdosing on laudanum during a bout of heavy drinking. A remorseful note was found among the papers on his person where he died near Sybil's Cave on October 7, 1841, reading: \"To the World – here I am on the very spot. May God forgive me for my misspent life.\" \n\nThe story, much publicized by the press, also emphasized the ineptitude and corruption of the city's watchmen system of law enforcement. At the time, New York City's population of 320,000 was served by an archaic force, consisting of one night watch, one hundred city marshals, thirty-one constables, and fifty-one police officers.\n\nThe popular theory was that Rogers was a victim of gang violence. In November 1842, Frederica Loss came forward and swore that Rogers' death was the result of a failed abortion attempt. Police refused to believe her story and the case remained unsolved. Interest in the story waned nine weeks later when the press began publicizing a different, unrelated murder case, that of John C. Colt's murder of Samuel Adams.\n\nRogers' story was fictionalized most notably by Edgar Allan Poe as \"The Mystery of Marie Rogêt\" (1842). The action of the story was relocated to Paris and the victim's body found in the River Seine. Poe presented the story as a sequel to \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" (1841), commonly considered the first modern detective story, and included its main character, C. Auguste Dupin. As Poe wrote in a letter: \"under the pretense of showing how Dupin... unravelled the mystery of Marie's assassination, I, in fact, enter into a very rigorous analysis of the real tragedy in New York.\" In the story, Dupin suggests several possible solutions but never actually names the murderer.\n\n"}
{"id": "387643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=387643", "title": "Michaud Affair", "text": "Michaud Affair\n\nThe Michaud Affair (in French l'Affaire Michaud) was a political controversy in Quebec that began in 2000. It revolved around the comments of Parti Québécois supporter Yves Michaud, those of the Quebec Jewish community (through the B'nai B'rith organization) and the subsequent censure motion from the National Assembly of Quebec members of parliament.\n\nWhat has been called the \"Michaud Affair\" started on December 5, 2000, in an interview on the Montreal radio station CKAC. Talk show host Paul Arcand asked: \"Don't you feel that there is a lack of interest of a good part of the population on the question of sovereignty and the national question, people who have had enough, for whom it is all over, (who say) let's move on to something else?\".\n\nTo which Yves Michaud replied: \"Well, I will tell you an anecdote. I was... I went to get my hair cut about a month ago. There was a Liberal senator who I will not name who doesn't speak [French]... even though he represents a French-speaking riding and who asked me: 'Are you still a separatist, Yves?' I said 'Yes, yes I am separatist just as you are Jewish. It took 2000 years for your people to have its homeland in Israel.' I said: 'Me, whether it takes 10, 50, or 100 more years it can wait.' So he told me: 'It's not the same.'\"\n\n\"It's never the same for them. So I said: it is not the same? The Armenians did not suffer, the Palestinians did not suffer, the Rwandans did not suffer. It's always (just) you. You are the only people who suffered in the history of humanity.\"\n\n\"After that, I was fed up. And here we are, I am completely indignant... that some suggested to rename the metro station [named after] Lionel Groulx, who was the spiritual father of two generations of Quebecers and is almost a Quebec idol. It's the B'nai B'rith that did that, which was the extremist phalange... There has been world Zionism... \"\n\nThe Senator mentioned was Leo Kolber, Michaud later revealed.\n\nOn December 12, 2000, the director of B'nai B'rith's Quebec chapter, Robert Libman, sent a memo to then Premier Lucien Bouchard requesting that he stop Michaud from being the PQ's candidate in the Mercier riding.\nOn December 13, 2000, Michaud presented a memorandum to Quebec's \"Estates-General on the situation of the French language\". He abandoned some parts of his text to say this, in front of members of the B'nai B'rith who were waiting their turn to speak:\n\n\"Groulx invited us 'to have, like the Jews, their rough will to survive, their invincible spirit of solidarity, their imperishable moral armor'. And the historian was giving the example of the Jewish people as a model to be followed so that Quebecers affirm their own national identity and fully assume the heritage of their history. Groulx, who is one of the intellectual guides of two generations of Quebecers and one whose name some wanted to see removed from the Lionel-Groulx station a few years ago, to probably replace it by the \"Mordecai Richler\" station, the René Lévesque Boulevard by, no doubt, \"Ariel Sharon\" boulevard, the Jacques-Cartier Place by the \"Galganov\" place, and so on. It is a little satirical, it is a little bit jokingly that I say that, but I think that some others are exaggerating and going a little too far. Immigrants, we want some. Yes, as much as possible and pushing up to the limit of our capacities to welcome them. Immigrants who will not only have rights but also responsibilities with regard to one of the most generous societies in the world which welcomes them with open arms and wallets, immigrants with responsibilities, that is, understanding and speaking our language, open to our culture, our way of working, of doing things, of interpreting the world in the French language and accompanying us on the road which leads us to the control of all the tools for our development (...) There is an ethnic vote against the sovereignty of the people of Quebec. If we do not integrate our immigrants, well then, we will enter on the slope of the Louisianization, and folklorization of our society.\"\n\nOn December 13, 2000, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, Jean Charest, presented to the National Assembly of Quebec a motion condemning references to \"an ethnic vote against the sovereignty of the people of Quebec\" and speaking of B'nai Brith as \"an extremist group against quebecers and against sovereignty\", as expressed by Yves Michaud at the Estates-General.\n\nThe Premier at the time, Lucien Bouchard, affirmed that he had been aware of similar remarks made by Michaud three (sic) days earlier and that he had asked Michaud to tone down his remarks in the Estates-General. Since Michaud did not do so and even added fuel to the fire, Bouchard therefore condemned the remarks in the name of his party and the government. The motion was adopted unanimously by the National Assembly.\n\nThe Michaud Affair re-awakened the bitter, very emotional and controversial divisions within the Parti Québécois between proponents of \"soft nationalists\" (aka \"nationalistes modérés\") versus \"hard liners\" (aka \"purs et durs\"). \n\nThis Affair must be interpreted in the context of long-standing historical tensions between some more radical factions within the Quebec nationalist movement and the English-speaking and Jewish communities of Quebec (\"Anglophones\"). Consequently, whereas most members of the Anglophone community and the general media consider Michaud's allegations to lean towards antisemitism, to Michaud supporters within the PQ and the sovereigntist movement generally the Michaud Affair is the result of censorship and defamation against the \"ethnic Quebecer\" minority and its \"rightful quest for political independence and autonomy\". Thus, this question is an emotional one for both the PQ's ethnic-nationalist fanatics and the Anglophone zealots.\n\nOn December 19, 2000, former Quebec Premier Jacques Parizeau and many others signed an open letter condemning the hasty resolution and supporting Michaud's. The letter was published in several newspapers.\n\nThe same day, Jacques Brassard, the parliamentary leader of the government at the time, answered also in an open letter to the newspapers, that the motion was not against Yves Michaud himself, but on his comments made as a public person seeking office in the government. He said that the National Assembly had the right to condemn unacceptable propositions made in a political context. He also stated that freedom of speech was not a one-way proposition.\n\nThe event, which is said to have been a reason for Lucien Bouchard's resignation on January 11, 2001, was not listed in B'nai Brith's annual compilation of anti-semitic events. \nDuring an interview for \"Voir\" magazine for the week of March 1, 2001, Robert Libman stated that he did not think Yves Michaud was an anti-semite and that his remarks had been distorted.\n\nSome less-involved observers in the media have expressed the view that although Michaud's comments were borderline and controversial as they could be interpreted as trivialization of the Shoah, the comparisons made by his accusers to notable antisemites like Ernst Zündel were excessive and exaggerated Michaud's intent.\n\nMichaud has been battling in court to defend his reputation since that time.\n\n\n"}

The festival is held twice a year in Helsinki, Finland. The festival also showcases documentaries and short films. The first Night Visions festival was organized in November 1997.\n\nThe first Night Visions festival was organized in Halloween 1997. The roots of the festival lay in Gorehound, a film zine focusing on genre cinema, whose readership and staff were responsible for the first Night Visions Film Festival. The current festival director Mikko Aromaa is former editor-in-chief of Gorehound. The first festival was a one night event of an overnight screening of genre films showed back to back on one screen.\n\nFrom 2002 onwards, Night Visions film festival has been arranged twice a year, with Back to Basics in mid-April and Maximum Halloween on Halloween weekend. The Maximum Halloween event was extended from one night event to a weekend event in 2005, showing movies on three different nights.\n\nIn January 2013 the film festival was awarded the Cultural Achievement Award 2012 from the City of Helsinki. The festival was credited for its bold, original and first-rate program, along with its unique atmosphere in overnight movie marathons. The judges also added that many of the films would never be seen in Finland without the festival. The winner was chosen by the Helsinki Board of Culture from nearly thousand nominees.\n\nThe 2014 film festival set a new record in attendance when Night Visions reported 8963 total attendees in Maximum Halloween event screenings and other organized events. With 5827 admissions in the same year's Back to Basics event and the one-off Night Visions ShockPoint, a gonzo documentary special, the film festival drew a total audience of 14,790 in 2014.\n\nBack to Basics is currently a four night event, climaxing in a marathon event that lasts from evening until early morning, usually screening films on two different screens. Films are played back to back with short intermissions in between. Back to Basics focuses on genre classics, showing older movies and underground cult films, with occasional stabs at mainstream and newer genre pieces. Back to Basics has featured movies such as Reefer Madness, The Story of Joanna, The Fountain, The Candy Snatchers, The Last House on the Left, Joysticks, Detroit 9000, The Room, Five Element Ninjas, The Toxic Avenger and more.\n\nMaximum Halloween is organized usually as close to Halloween as possible, screening films on multiple screens and theaters. The event focuses on newer genre films and has acted as a premiere venue for many films in Finland. Maximum Halloween also usually screens a selection of old classics and documentaries. The 2014 Maximum Halloween screened 45 feature length films and documentaries in three different theaters, along with a selection of short films during the five-day event. The event has featured films such as Saw, The Descent, Reeker, Near Dark, Tokyo Gore Police, The Forbidden Door, The Disappearance of Alice Creed, Profondo Rosso, Shogun Assassin and many more along the years.\n\nNight Visions has had a varied line-up of guest film-makers and actors during its run. The guests are sometimes associated with the themes of the festival; such as Christopher Lee and the Hammer Film Productions theme of the 2002 festival or Lloyd Kaufman of Troma Entertainment fame in the 2014 festival. Other special guests have included Dario Argento, Paul Verhoeven, John McNaughton, John Waters and Udo Kier among others.\n\nIn 2014 Night Visions organized an industry afternoon, in collaboration with Nordic Genre Invasion, that featured many upcoming nordic filmmakers as well as industry veterans. The afternoon consisted of movie screenings and panel discussion.\n\nThe Night Visions Audience Award has been awarded since 2008 to promote the recognition of genre cinema in Finland and in other nordic countries. All movies released in the same year, or the year before, the festival is held are eligible. The winner is decided by the audience in a ballot organized at the Maximum Halloween screenings.\n\nThe 2013 winner, Frank Pavich's documentary film Jodorowsky's Dune, was the first non-fiction film to win the award.\n\n"}

{"id": "36896327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36896327", "title": "Padre Canyon incident", "text": "Padre Canyon incident\n\nThe Padre Canyon incident was a skirmish in November 1899 between a group of Navajo hunters and a posse of Arizona lawmen. Among other things, it was significant in that it nearly started a large-scale Indian war in Coconino County and it led to the expansion of the Navajo Reservation. It was also the final armed conflict during a land dispute between the Navajo and American settlers, as well as one of the bloodiest.\n\nIn the 1880s and 1890s, the Navajo band of Chief B'ugoettin were fighting a minor, undeclared war with local cattlemen for control of what was later known as the Leupp Extension, a large area of rangeland between Flagstaff, the Hopi Reservation, and the Colorado River, which would later become part of the Navajo Reservation. When the trouble began, the Leupp Extension was owned by the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, which acquired the land from the federal government through a grant. Like other railroads in the Old West, the Atlantic and Pacific sold unused land to pioneers, but, due to the Navajo presence in the Leupp Extension, pioneers were reluctant to buy land from them.\n\nEventually, cattlemen began moving their herds into the area, which only added tension to an already uneasy situation. Initially, the Navajo pleaded to the federal government for their help, but when that failed they retaliated by raiding for livestock. The cattlemen responded in a like manner, but for the most part the violence was minimal. Usually, when the Navajo captured a thief they would beat him up and then send him on his way. As was the case in 1899.\n\nWilliam Henry Montgomery was a nineteen-year-old cowboy employed by William Roden, Jr. According to some accounts, on November 6, Montgomery was caught trying to steal some ponies from a group of Navajo hunters so three of the natives assaulted him in the usual manner. Wanting revenge, Montgomery went to Flagstaff and persuaded the county to have warrants issued for the arrest of the three natives. Other accounts say that the posse was responding to allegations of deer poaching and the theft of horses from William Roden's ranch, but the exact cause for the issuing of the warrants remains uncertain.\n\nTo serve the warrants, Deputy Sheriff Dan Hogan formed a posse consisting of himself, William Montgomery, William Roden and Walter Durham, who was another cowboy from the Roden Ranch.\n\nOn the morning of November 11, Hogan and Montgomery left Flagstaff and headed to the Roden Ranch, where they recruited Roden and Durham. From there the posse went east towards Padre Canyon. Later that afternoon, at the edge of Elliott Canyon, the posse spotted a small Navajo camp in the brush down below near the junction of Padre Canyon and Canyon Diablo. After dismounting and making their way down the canyon wall, they stealthily advanced on a wickiup that was occupied by an elderly man who was tanning deer hide.\n\nAt this time, four other Navajo men spotted Montgomery as they were walking back to camp from a hunting trip. Assuming he was there to steal horses, the Navajos immediately opened fire on Montgomery, striking him in the heart and killing him instantly. A shootout ensued and it was later described by the \"Coconino Sun\" as being \"one of the most desperate conflicts ever to be fought in the Southwest.\"\n\nThe Navajo fire was accurate so the posse was forced to retreat at sundown. Fearing they would be too exposed by climbing back up the canyon wall, the possemen made their way south to a nearby railroad and on the following morning they succeeded in stopping a train for a ride back to Flagstaff.\n\nTwo of the Navajos were killed and one other was wounded. Deputy Hogan received a \"long gash\" across his shoulders as he was bending over to take cover and Roden received a shot to the groin. Montgomery was dead and Durham escaped with the other survivors unharmed.\n\nNews of the shooting quickly spread throughout Arizona and the rest of the nation, but it took nearly a month before the federal government responded. During that time, both the Navajo and the Americans feared that the other side would launch a campaign of reprisal. As result, Flagstaff was fortified by the town militia.\n\nEventually, the hunters who were involved in the fight were told to report to Flagstaff for a hearing in court, which they refused to do at first. Instead, Chief B'ugoettin assembled 300 heavily armed warriors and led them to Flagstaff. His plan was to conceal his force in the woods outside of town and then go in unarmed with two men to return the posse's horses, attacking only if they were placed in jail. Fortunately, however, Reverend William R. Johnston helped defuse the situation and he promised B'ugoettin that the three hunters would receive an adequate defense if they surrendered now. B'ugoettin agreed so the attack on Flagstaff never came.\n\nThe trial was held in the Coconino County Courthouse in September 1900, during which, the wounded Navajo hunter, Haastiin Biwoo Adin, impressed Judge Richard E. Sloan with his address so much so that he found all three of the hunters innocent. Reverend Johnston's nine-year-old son, Philip, translated the Navajo's speech for the court.\n\nAfter the trial, a Navajo delegation was sent to Washington, D. C. to petition the government for the creation of the Leupp Extension. Ultimately, the delegation was successful in convincing President Theodore Roosevelt, who issued his executive order on November 14, 1901. The Leupp Extension was named after Roosevelt's commissioner of Indian affairs, Francis E. Leupp, and it led to the founding of the town Leupp. Also, B'ugoettin rewarded Reverend Johnston by permitting him to build a mission at Tolchaco, which was located about seven miles south of Leupp.\n"}
{"id": "375280", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=375280", "title": "Patriots' Day", "text": "Patriots' Day\n\nPatriots' Day is an annual event, formalized as several state holidays, commemorating the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first battles of the American Revolutionary War.\n\nThe holiday was originally celebrated on April 19, the actual anniversary of the battles (fought in 1775). Since 1969, it has been observed on the third Monday in April in Massachusetts and in Maine (which until the Missouri Compromise of 1820 was part of Massachusetts). The Monday holiday creates a three-day long weekend. It is also the first day of a vacation week for public schools in both states and a school holiday for many local colleges and universities, both public and private.\n\nThe day is a public school observance day in Wisconsin. Florida law also encourages people to celebrate it, though it is not treated as a public holiday. Connecticut began observance in 2018.\n\nObservances and re-enactments of the battles occur annually at Lexington Green in Lexington, Massachusetts (around 6:00 am) and the Old North Bridge in Concord, Massachusetts (around 9:00 am). In the morning, mounted re-enactors with state police escorts retrace the Midnight Rides of Paul Revere and William Dawes, calling out warnings the whole way.\n\nThe most significant celebration of Patriots' Day is the Boston Marathon, which has been run every Patriots' Day since April 19, 1897 to mark the then-recently established holiday, with the race linking the Athenian and American struggles for liberty (marathons being so named after the Greek Battle of Marathon).\n\nIn 1894 the Lexington Historical Society petitioned the Massachusetts State Legislature to proclaim April 19 as \"Lexington Day.\" Concord countered with \"Concord Day.\" Governor Frederic T. Greenhalge opted for a compromise: Patriots' Day. \nPatriots' Day was first proclaimed in Massachusetts in 1894 by Gov. Greenhalge replacing Fast Day as a public holiday. The idea was introduced to the Governor by the statesman from Lowell, Isaac Henry Paige. It was established on April 19, commemorating the date of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, and consolidating the longstanding municipal observances of Lexington Day and Concord Day. It also marked the first bloodshed of the American Civil War in the Baltimore riot of 1861, during which four members of the Massachusetts militia were slain and 36 injured. The dual commemoration, Greenhalge explained, celebrated \"the anniversary of the birth of liberty and union.\" In 1938, with the generation that had fought in the Civil War largely off the voter rolls, the Massachusetts legislature passed a bill establishing the holiday \"in commemoration of the opening events of the War of the Revolution.\"\n\nMaine followed Massachusetts in 1907 and replaced its Fast Day with Patriot's Day.\nOn June 10, 2017, Governor Dannel Malloy signed a bill establishing Patriots' Day as a statewide unpaid holiday in Connecticut. On April 16, 2018 Connecticut became the 4th state to recognize the holiday.\n\nThe Boston Marathon is run on Patriots' Day every year, since its inception in 1897, even during the World War years. Therefore, sometimes the holiday is referred to as \"Marathon Monday\".\n\nThe Boston Red Sox have been scheduled to play at home in Fenway Park on Patriots' Day every year since 1959. The games were postponed due to weather in 1959, 1961, 1965, 1967, 1984, and 2018, canceled in 1995 because of the late start to the season but not in 2013 due to the Boston Marathon bombing. https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?date=2013-04-15 From 1968 to 2006 the games started early, in the morning, around 11:00 am. The early start to these games usually resulted in the game ending just as the marathon is heading through Kenmore Square. However, since 2007 the marathon has started between 9:30 am and 10:00 am, resulting in the racers going through Kenmore towards the middle of the Red Sox game.\n\n"}

They moved to the city and secured live work. They rapidly got management with Jonathan Shalit and later a record deal with Sony Music UK for two singles and an album. The pair worked on recording material and continued to perform live, including opening for D12, and appearing on MTV. Their Scottish identity was known only to a small circle.\n\nHowever, Sony's merger and subsequent job losses left them without supporters in the record company and their planned first single was delayed for at least 6 months as the label focused on other acts. Boyd had got married and his wife, still in Scotland, was expecting a child. With work having dried up, he left the group, moving back to Scotland, and getting work in the oil industry.\n\nBain continued performing as Brains on a smaller scale. He subsequently came out and revealed the hoax.\n\nThe duo subsequently reunited and released an EP in October 2013 called \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels\".\n\n"}

A picture of the ship forms an essential part of traditional Japanese New Year celebrations.\n\nDuring the first three days of the New Year the Seven Lucky Gods are said to pilot through the heavens and into human ports a mythical ship called the Takarabune, or Treasure Ship. The gods carry with them \"takaramono\", or treasure things, including the hat of invisibility (\"kakuregasa\"), rolls of brocade (\"orimono\"), the inexhaustible purse (\"kanebukuro\"), the secret keys to the treasure shed of the gods (\"kagi\"), the scrolls of books of wisdom and life (\"makimono\"), the magic mallet (\"kozuchi\"), the lucky raincoat (\"kakuremino\"), the robe of fairy feathers (\"hagoromo\"), and the bag of fortune (\"nunobukuro\").\n\nA picture of the ship forms an essential part of traditional Japanese New Year celebrations. According to custom, placing a Takarabune woodblock print beneath a pillow on the night of 2 January may induce a lucky dream - a sign that the year to come will be fortunate. In the event of an unpleasant dream, the print may be disposed of by tossing it into a river.\n\nThe custom of putting a picture under the pillow started around the Muromachi period. It was initially popular among the nobility, and spread to commoners during the later Edo period. Street vendors sold cheap woodblock prints, intended for single use.\n\nMany Takarabune prints show a crane above and a turtle below, representative of longevity and felicity, as well as a palindromic poem which tells of a long night in a boat. On awaking at dawn, everyone hears the sound of waves and sees smooth sailing ahead.\n"}
{"id": "716962", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=716962", "title": "Tear down this wall!", "text": "Tear down this wall!\n\n\"Tear down this wall!\" is a line from a speech made by U.S. President Ronald Reagan in West Berlin on June 12, 1987, calling for the leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, to open up the barrier which had divided West and East Berlin since 1961. Peter Robinson, the White House speechwriter who drafted the address, said its most famous line was inspired by a conversation with Ingeborg Elz of West Berlin who had mentioned it in a conversation with him.\n\nThe \"tear down this wall\" speech was not the first time Reagan had addressed the issue of the Berlin Wall: in a visit to West Berlin in June 1982, he'd stated \"I'd like to ask the Soviet leaders one question [...] Why is the wall there?\", and in 1986, 25 years after the construction of the wall, in response to West German newspaper \"Bild-Zeitung\" asking when he thought the wall could be \"torn down\", Reagan said, \"I call upon those responsible to dismantle it [today]\".\n\nOn the day before Reagan's 1987 visit, 50,000 people had demonstrated against the presence of the American president in Berlin. During the visit itself, wide swaths of Berlin were closed off to prevent further anti-Reagan protests. The district of Kreuzberg, in particular, was targeted in this respect, with movement throughout this portion of the city in effect restrained completely (for instance the subway line 1 was shut down).\n\nThe speech was also a source of considerable controversy within the Reagan administration itself, with several senior staffers and aides advising against the phrase, saying anything that might cause further East-West tensions or potential embarrassment to Gorbachev, with whom President Reagan had built a good relationship, should be omitted. American officials in West Germany and presidential speechwriters, including Peter Robinson, thought otherwise. Robinson traveled to West Germany to inspect potential speech venues, and gained an overall sense that the majority of West Berliners opposed the wall. Despite getting little support for suggesting Reagan demand the wall's removal, Robinson kept the phrase in the speech text. On May 18, 1987, President Reagan met with his speechwriters and responded to the speech by saying, \"I thought it was a good, solid draft.\" White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker objected, saying it sounded \"extreme\" and \"unpresidential\", and Deputy U.S. National Security Advisor Colin Powell agreed. Nevertheless, Reagan liked the passage, saying, \"I think we'll leave it in.\"\n\nChief speechwriter Anthony Dolan gives another account of the line's origins, however, attributing it directly to Reagan. In an article published in \"The Wall Street Journal\" in November 2009, Dolan gives a detailed account of how in an Oval Office meeting that was prior to Robinson's draft Reagan came up with the line on his own. He records vivid impressions of his own reaction and Robinson's at the time. This led to a friendly exchange of letters between Robinson and Dolan over their differing accounts, which \"The Wall Street Journal\" published.\n\nArriving in Berlin on June 12, 1987, President and Mrs. Reagan were taken to the Reichstag, where they viewed the wall from a balcony. Reagan then made his speech at the Brandenburg Gate at 2:00 pm, in front of two panes of bulletproof glass. Among the spectators were West German President Richard von Weizsäcker, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and West Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen.\n\nThat afternoon, Reagan said,\n\nLater on in his speech, President Reagan said, \"As I looked out a moment ago from the Reichstag, that embodiment of German unity, I noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young Berliner, 'This wall will fall. Beliefs become reality.' Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth. The wall cannot withstand freedom.\"\n\nAnother highlight of the speech was Reagan's call to end the arms race with his reference to the Soviets' SS-20 nuclear weapons, and the possibility \"not merely of limiting the growth of arms, but of eliminating, for the first time, an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the Earth.\"\n\nThe speech received \"relatively little coverage from the media\", \"Time\" magazine claimed 20 years later. John Kornblum, senior US diplomat in Berlin at the time of Reagan's speech, and US Ambassador to Germany from 1997 to 2001, said \"[The speech] wasn't really elevated to its current status until 1989, after the wall came down.\" The muted response in the Western media contrasted with the reaction from the East: East German Politburo member Günter Schabowski considered the speech to be \"absurd\", and the Soviet press agency TASS accused Reagan of giving an \"openly provocative, war-mongering speech.\" It was Schabowski who two and a half years later, on 9 November 1989, became the person to open the wall by providing a slightly mistaken answer on a press conference about changes in travel regulations for East German citizens.\n\nFormer West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he would never forget standing near Reagan when he challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. \"He was a stroke of luck for the world, especially for Europe.\"\n\nIn an interview with Reagan himself, he recalls the East German police not allowing people to get near the wall, which prevented the citizens from experiencing the speech at all. The fact that West German police acted in a similar way has, however seldom, been noted in accounts such as these.\n\nPeter Robinson, the White House wordsmith who drafted the address, said its most famous line was inspired by a conversation with Ingeborg Elz of West Berlin who had remarked in a conversation with him, \"If this man Gorbachev is serious with his talk of \"Glasnost\" and \"perestroika\" he can prove it by getting rid of this wall.\"\n\nDespite Reagan urging Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, there are some such as Romesh Ratnesar of \"Time\" who commented that there is little evidence that the speech had any impact on the decision to tear down the wall, let alone an impact on the people he addressed. Another critic was Liam Hoare in a 2012 article in \"The Atlantic\", who pointed to the many reasons for the tendency for American media to focus on the significance of this particular speech, without weighing the complexity of the events as they unfolded in both East and West Germany and the Soviet Union.\n\nAuthor James Mann disagreed with both critics like Hoare, who saw Reagan's speech as having no real effect, and those who praised the speech as key to shaking Soviet confidence. In a 2007 opinion article in \"The New York Times\", he put the speech in the context of previous Reagan overtures to the Soviet Union, such as the Reykjavik summit of the previous year, which had very nearly resulted in an agreement to eliminate American and Soviet nuclear weapons entirely. He characterized the speech as a way for Reagan to assuage his right-wing critics that he was still tough on communism, while also extending a renewed invitation to Gorbachev to work together to create \"the vastly more relaxed climate in which the Soviets sat on their hands when the wall came down.\" Reagan, claimed Mann, \"wasn't trying to land a knockout blow on the Soviet regime, nor was he engaging in mere political theater. He was instead doing something else on that damp day in Berlin 20 years [before Mann's article] – he was helping to set the terms for the end of the cold war.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12237992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12237992", "title": "Theater auf der Wieden", "text": "Theater auf der Wieden\n\nThe Theater auf der Wieden, also called the Freihaus-Theater auf der Wieden or the Wiednertheater, was a theater located in the then-suburban Wieden district of Vienna in the late 18th century. It existed for only 14 years (1787–1801), but during this time it was the venue for the premiere of no fewer than 350 theatrical works, of which the most celebrated was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's opera \"The Magic Flute\". During most of this period the director of the theater was Emanuel Schikaneder, remembered today as librettist and impresario of \"The Magic Flute\".\n\nThe \"Freihaus\" was a large complex of businesses and residences belonging to the Starhemberg family. It was located at the northern edge of the Wiedner suburb, separated from the inner city by the \"Glacis\", the ring of open land that surrounded inner Vienna for purposes of military defense.\n\nThe Freihaus attracted intensive development because by an earlier Imperial decree (1647) it was free from taxation. The complex was called the \"Starhembergische Freihaus\" (\"free-house of the Starhembergs\"), from which was derived the name \"Freihaus-Theater\".\n\nChristian Rossbach, a theater director who had already been successfully mounting productions in Vienna for several years, made an application to build a new theater in the Freihaus. This was approved 16 March 1787, and construction began, following a design by the architect Andreas Zach. The building was completed within six months and was opened for its first performance on 14 October.\n\nThe theater was a three-story structure having a divided parterre (ground level) and two galleries (balconies). The external walls and roof were of brick and the interior was of wood. According to Krzeszowiak the theater had \"very good acoustics\". No description of the theater's capacity survives. The dimensions of the theater were 30 by 15 meters; Buch judges that the theater must have held over 500 spectators; Honolka estimates 800, then 1000 following an expansion carried out by Emanuel Schikaneder.\n\nThe stage area was substantial, forming 12 meters of the 30 meter length of the building. Honolka judges that it was \"planned from the beginning for opulent scenic design.\" Examining the plays and librettos of Emanuel Schikaneder, Buch infers \"a mechanical stage with three trap doors, movable flats and backdrops, and devices to accommodate flying machines, storms, sea battles, and similar effects.\"\n\nThe founding director was Christian Rossbach, who served from October 1787 to March 1788. Rossbach's venture lasted only a few months and ended in financial failure, despite a dispensation from the Emperor to perform during Lent. He first tried playing in cheaper venues in Vienna, then left Vienna with half of his troupe to play the provinces in Moravia.\n\nRossbach was succeeded by Johann Friedel, who ran the productions from March 1788 to his death in March 1789. Friedel worked in collaboration with his lover Eleonore Schikaneder, the estranged wife of Friedel's former theatrical colleague Emanuel Schikaneder. Like Rossbach Friedel was unable to make the theater a success, despite making improvements to the property and mounting as many as nine productions within a period of two weeks; Honolka comments that \"they can scarcely have been properly rehearsed.\" \n\nFollowing Friedel's death, Eleonore reconciled with her husband and invited him to take on the directorship, which he held from July 1789 until the theater's closure in June 1801. Schikaneder created a new troupe partly from the participants in Friedel's ensemble, and partly from personnel he brought with him from his former troupe, playing in Regensburg. The company offered \"mostly German operas and plays with songs and incidental music (tragedies, comedies, and spectacles with elaborate stage machinery)\". The company staged Mozart's \"Abduction from the Seraglio\" in April and May 1789.\n\nStarting in 1789, Schikaneder's company staged a series of fairy tale operas. These included \"Der Stein der Weisen\" (\"The Philosopher's Stone\"), a collaboratively written work to which Mozart contributed a small portion of the music (see Benedikt Schack). The fairy tale series culminated with the premiere in September 1791 of Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\". The latter was a success, and played for over 100 performances in its first year alone, 223 over the life of the theater. It gave rise to a sequel by Schikaneder and Peter von Winter (1798) entitled \"The Magic Flute Second Part\".\n\nThe theater continued to be used for opera until 1801, when Schikaneder moved the troupe to his newly built \"Theater an der Wien\". Prince Starhemberg, an efficient businessman, promptly tore down the old theater and replaced it with apartment housing. The roof tiles were reinstalled on the parish church of Perchtoldsdorf, where they can be seen to this day ().\n\nPublished opinion concerning the theater has evolved, raising the estimation of the quality of the building and the performances therein. This rise in its estimate has paralleled shifts in Mozart biography, as the field shifts away from the traditional assessment of Mozart's later life as wretched and despairing.\n\nConcerning the building, testimony from the early Romantic era is preserved in the writings of Ignaz von Seyfried (1776–1841), who was the musical director of the theater from 1798 to 1801; he continued in this role at the Theater an der Wien until 1826. In 1840, he wrote a contribution to the \"Neue Zeitschrift für Musik\" (12/46, 5 June 1840) in which he described the \"Theater an der Wieden\" in rather derogatory terms: \"... for that limited venue, not much better than a wooden shack [German \"Holzbude\"], Mozart composed his immortal Magic Flute\". As modern research has shown, this description is entirely false; see in particular Lorenz (2008). Of the legend, Kurt Honolka writes:\nThe loss of prestige which Schikaneder suffered at the end of the 19th century also extended to \"his\" theater. Of course, its simple structure could not measure up to the palatial court or civic \"New Renaissance\" buildings then being built. But it was of solid stone, with a tiled roof. The interior was made of wood, as was usual at the time. \nModern notes written for concert programs and recordings often still perpetuate the \"shack\" legend.\n\nTraditional views also asserted that the standard of musical execution in the theater was poor; this for instance is the view taken in Hermann Abert's influential Mozart biography. The modern scholar David Buch, who had access to more historical materials than Abert, offers a different assessment:\nAnother myth about this theater has also persisted in modern literature, namely, that the music was of an inferior quality and that the performances were rather crude. While there is one derisive review of a performance at the Theater auf der Wieden by a north German commentator in 1793, most contemporary reviews were positive, noting a high standard of musical performance. \n"}

Kummer never even met his subjects. His primary publisher, \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" issued a public apology for running Kummer's stories, calling them \"a betrayal of monumental proportions\". His work was also published in \"Der Spiegel\", \"Stern\", the \"Tagesanzeiger\", the \"Berner Zeitung\", and the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\". Because of the timespan in which his bogus reporting appeared in print, he has earned comparisons to Jayson Blair and Stephen Glass.\n\nTom Kummer published fake interviews with the following celebrities:\n\nIn his profile of Mike Tyson, Kummer quotes the boxer talking about eating cockroaches with bread in prison in order to get more protein. Sharon Stone confesses her sexual fantasies to Kummer, and she expresses a desire to \"irritate men from wholly different classes of society\". In Kummer's profile of Kim Basinger, she reveals that she gave Alec Baldwin see-through underwear.\n\nCourtney Love describes herself as \"depressed, empty, and stupid.\" She also says, \"There are seagulls on the Riviera, slurping ice-cooled gin and tonics,\" and, \"Minotauruses are eating the genitals of the moon.\" Kummer has Brad Pitt saying, \"sometimes, something will be hanging out of my nose for days.\" Bruce Willis tells Kummer, \"I understood pretty early on that we do not advance through morality, but immorality, vices, cynicism.\"\n\nKummer was fond of injecting references to other writers in his profiles, often by having a celebrity quote an author. He discusses \"Neuromancer\" with Pamela Anderson. He has Sean Penn quote Kierkegaard and Mike Tyson quote Nietzsche.\n\n\"Marie Claire\" sought out Kummer for an interview at the height of his success. He told the magazine that his secret was to demand no less than 45 minutes with his subject. According to Katie Roiphe, \"What eventually betrayed [Kummer] was his inability to be banal, his desire to put ideas into people's mouths that they would never actually utter.\"\n\nHolger Hoetzel, a journalist with \"Focus\" magazine, uncovered Kummer's fraud. Hoetzel was suspicious of Kummer's access to such famous celebrities, and along with many of his foreign correspondent colleagues, he was being hounded by his editors to match Kummer's efforts. One reporter claimed, \"Our editors were ringing up and saying, Why can't you go fishing with Bruce Willis, riding with Robert Redford and playing golf with Kevin Costner?\"\n\nKummer's profile of Courtney Love, in particular, struck Hoetzel as too outlandish to be true. \"That did it for me. We all know Courtney Love is far out, but this was something else. This woman has been so controlling about all press and all interviews were conducted under extremely restrictive circumstances. And yet this guy seemed to have this incredible access.\" Hoetzel translated Kummer's profile of Love and sent it to her publicist, which began the cascade of denials from publicists who insisted their clients had never even met Kummer.\n\nOne of the chief editors of \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\", Christian Kaemmerling, said the paper began to suspect Kummer's work was false in 1999. They also discovered that Kummer had been fired for writing a fabricated story in another paper in 1990. Kammerling and his colleague Ulf Poschardt were both fired for publishing Kummer's hoaxes. Claus Lutterbeck, one of the foreign correspondents who was also being pressured to match Kummer's success, explained how such an elaborate and sustained fraud could happen among the foreign press in Hollywood. \"The problem is that no one, not even our bosses, knows how Hollywood really works. They don't know how hard it is to get any access at all. They think we spend our time at cocktail parties with movie stars. So someone like Kummer can come along and they have no control over him.\"\n\nKummer has maintained a largely unapologetic stance about his fraud. He has referred to his work as \"montage reporting\" from \"the school of borderline reporting\", where his goal was simply to entertain the reader, knowing full well that celebrities would never provide such interesting material. He told the \"Berner Zeitung\", \"Interviews are an art form. Only people in Switzerland still believe that they have to be true word for word.\" \"SZ-Magazin\", the Friday section of Süddeutsche Zeitung where his profiles appeared would frequently feature satirical articles and graphics. Even some of his publishers came to his defense. The \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" went on record as dismissing the celebrity profile genre as \"tedious\", concluding: \"No exclusive interviews blossom behind the hedges of Malibu, and the people who live there are paying a lot of money to make sure things stay that way.\" In the preface for a 1997 compilation of Kummer's interviews, Ulf Poschardt actually outlines Kummer's gonzo journalism as a \"stylistic honing during the transcription of the tapes\", where Kummer \"decided to add his authorship into the framework of classical journalism, to inject it with fun and intelligence, taking no prisoners.\"\n\nKummer is the subject of a 2011 documentary called \"Bad Boy Kummer\" by Miklós Gimes.\n\n"}

{"id": "18711253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18711253", "title": "Ziggy (elephant)", "text": "Ziggy (elephant)\n\nZiggy (ca. 1917–October 27, 1975) was a male Indian elephant who lived at Brookfield Zoo outside Chicago from 1936 to 1975. He weighed about six tons and was over ten feet tall. After attacking and nearly killing his keeper in 1941, Ziggy was chained to the wall of an indoor enclosure, and remained there for nearly three decades. His confinement became a cause célèbre in the late 1960s, when school children and other animal enthusiasts began campaigning for his release. Ziggy was briefly allowed to go outside in 1970, and a year later, the zoo completed a new outdoor facility specifically designed for the elephant. However, Ziggy only enjoyed a few years of freedom before dying in 1975.\n\nBorn in Asia, Ziggy was named after Florenz Ziegfeld, who purchased the elephant from John Ringling in 1920. Ziegfeld thought the elephant, then a 250-pound youngster, would be a good birthday present for his six-year-old daughter. However, the elephant was sold back to Ringling after the animal reportedly trampled through the Ziegfelds' greenhouse. Ringling, in turn, sold the elephant to Singer's Midget Circus. While touring with Singer's troupe, Ziggy bonded with a dwarf named Charles Becker, who taught the elephant how to dance, play a harmonica, and smoke cigarettes.\n\nAt the San Diego Exposition Children's Circus in February 1936, Becker fell ill, and Ziggy was paired with a new handler, Johnny Winters. However, the elephant did not respond well to Winters, and fled from the grounds. Ziggy was later found in Balboa Park, and Becker was called from his sickbed to coax the elephant out. Some reports claimed that Ziggy had killed a trombone player in the midst of his escape, but this was never verified. In any case, the circus decided it could no longer keep the elephant, and sold him to Brookfield Zoo. Ziggy arrived at Brookfield in July 1936 and became a popular attraction for visitors.\n\nAt Brookfield Zoo on April 26, 1941, Ziggy suddenly turned on his keeper, George \"Slim\" Lewis. The elephant first struck Lewis to the ground with his trunk and pulled him beneath his head. Ziggy then tried to gore Lewis, but the keeper dodged each attack by slipping between the elephant's tusks. Eventually, Ziggy lunged so hard that his tusks became lodged in the ground for several seconds. Sensing his chance to escape, Lewis pulled himself up by grabbing onto Ziggy's ear, then punched the elephant in the eye. With Ziggy momentarily stunned, Lewis jumped into the moat around the elephant's enclosure and climbed to the other side.\n\nDespite his ordeal, Lewis was an animal lover, and he begged zoo director Robert Bean to spare Ziggy's life. Bean decided that the animal would not be killed, but would be kept inside the Pachyderm House at all times as a safety precaution. Later that day, Lewis returned to Ziggy's yard and, with the help of another elephant, led the animal indoors. For the next few decades, the animal would remain alone in a stall, attached to a wall with a chain of variable length.\n\nYears later, Lewis explained that Ziggy was in the midst of his musth period on the day of the attack. Musth is a time of high testosterone levels in male elephants, leading to aggressive behavior, and Ziggy may have been agitated because keepers had been urging him to mate with a female elephant.\n\nIn March 1969, Michael Sneed of the \"Chicago Tribune\" called attention to Ziggy's confinement, writing, \"Ziggy's six-foot tusks, which once grew so long they crossed each other, now are decayed and broken. The once frequent majestic blasts from his huge trunk wail very rarely... Ziggy refuses to face his visitors and turns toward the back wall, swaying back and forth, occasionally picking up stray articles of food thrown at him.\" The article caused a sensation, and Brookfield Zoo was inundated with letters about Ziggy. Peter Crowcroft, who had recently become the zoo director, announced that he wanted to let Ziggy go outdoors again. However, he explained that the zoo would need to build a new $50,000 facility to accommodate the elephant, something they could not afford at the time.\n\nIn response, people throughout the Chicago area, particularly schoolchildren, began collecting money for the \"Ziggy Fund\". Many elementary schools and high schools organized fundraisers, and the Bellwood Boys' Club made a five-foot-tall papier-mâché statue of Ziggy, which they paraded through the streets while collecting quarters. A number of donations also arrived from overseas, including several from American soldiers who had been stationed in Vietnam. In August 1970, the zoo received a major boost when William Sitwell, president of the Chicagoland Buick-Opel Dealers Association, pledged to match the money raised from individual sources.\n\nAs the Brookfield Zoo came closer to its $50,000 target, zoo officials decided they should see how Ziggy would react to being outdoors before building a new facility for the elephant. On September 23, 1970, Ziggy saw the sun for the first time in nearly thirty years when he was allowed to walk through a barricaded portion of his old yard. Slim Lewis traveled from Seattle, Washington, to escort the elephant outside. Ziggy stood at the doorway for about thirty minutes, then slowly came out and starting eating a bale of hay. After exploring the yard for an hour and a half, Ziggy went back inside.\n\nZiggy's new outdoor facility was completed during the summer of 1971. Most of the $50,000 was spent on a remote control door, which would allow the elephant to go inside and outside without human intervention. Ziggy finally entered his new home on August 28, 1971, in front of more than one thousand cheering people. Over the next few months, the zoo added a wading pool to Ziggy's yard and refurbished his indoor stall.\n\nThe next few years were generally quiet for Ziggy. In March 1975, however, Ziggy fell into the moat around his enclosure while trying to poke a zookeeper with his trunk. The elephant survived the fall, but broke a tusk and scraped his head. Workers poured 84,000 pounds (42 tons) of gravel into the moat to give Ziggy a ramp to climb. The elephant would not move for 31 hours, but when a zookeeper (Leroy Woodruff) opened a nearby door to a female elephant's enclosure, Ziggy decided to pull himself out. Once free, however, he ignored the female elephant and simply went toward his food.\n\nA few months later, Ziggy lay down to rest in his indoor stall, rolled onto his side, and died while being bathed by Lewis. Zoo spokespeople said Ziggy had mainly died of old age, explaining that the animal's health had been declining long before he fell into the moat.\n\nZiggy's remains were given to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where his bones remain in storage.. Until his skeleton was displayed for the “Specimens” exhibit in early 2017. https://www.fieldmuseum.org/discover/on-exhibit/specimens/\n\nA children's book about Ziggy's life, \"Ziggy: The World's Greatest Elephant\", was released in 1995. It was written by Tom Hollatz and illustrated by Ray Shlemon.\n\nA Ziggy memorial made from obsidian with ivory made from Ziggy's tusks can be found at the Lizzadro Museum of Lapidary Art in Elmhurst, Illinois, in a diorama in their permanent collection.\n\n"}
