Rather than accepting his dismissal, Ed decides to fight back. With the help of a United States senator, he lobbies the United States Congress and is the stimulus to passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Because Missy's cancer is life-threatening, she is visited by the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and she wishes to go to the White House, visit the Oval Office, and hopefully see President Bill Clinton. Although Make-A-Wish is not so sure if they can grant her wish, in the end she does in fact get to visit the Oval Office and meet President Bill Clinton, playing himself in a cameo appearance.\n\nMissy is based on the merging of two women, Melissa Weaver and Dixie Yandle.

{"id": "1842460", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1842460", "title": "Age fabrication", "text": "Age fabrication\n\nAge fabrication occurs when a person deliberately misrepresents their true age. This is usually done with the intent to garner privileges or status that would not otherwise be available to the person. It may be done through the use of oral or written statements or through the altering, doctoring or forging of vital records.\n\nOn some occasions, age is increased so as to make cut-offs for minimum legal or employable age in showbusiness or professional sports. Sometimes it is not the people themselves who lower their public age, but others around them such as publicists, parents, and other handlers. Most cases involve taking or adding one or two years to their age. However, in more extreme cases such as with Al Lewis and Charo, a decade has been added or subtracted. Official state documents (such as birth, marriage and death certificates, the census, and other identity documents) typically provide the correct date.\n\nAlthough uncommon in modern Western society, it is still possible for a person not to know their exact date of birth. Such a person may arbitrarily choose a date of birth which after later research is found to be false. This situation should not be considered age fabrication as there is no obvious intent to deceive on the part of the individual.\n\nSubtracting time from one's age is often known in English as \"shaving\", while adding time to one's age may be referred to as \"padding\".\n\nIn sports, people may falsify their age to make themselves appear younger thus enabling them compete in world-level junior events (with prominent examples appearing in football (soccer) and athletics). In gymnastics, diving, and figure skating, competitors may claim to be older in order to bring themselves over the age minimums for senior competition or below an age limit for junior competition. A female pair skater may be aged up while her male partner may be aged down to allow them to compete together. In some cases, they may feel pressure to change their ages. As these fabrications have an effect upon a person's performance (through the greater athleticism of age or greater flexibility of youth), the practice is known as age cheating in the field of sports.\n\n\nAge fabrication is common in the entertainment industry. Many actresses subtract at least one year from their actual age so that producers and casting directors will be more likely to hire them for roles, or for publicity purposes. \"Time\" joked in 1949:\n\n\n\n\nThere are many stories of men lying about their age to join the armed forces, for example to fight in World War I. In mid-1918, Walt Disney attempted to join the United States Army to fight against the Germans, but he was rejected for being too young. After forging the date of birth on his birth certificate to 1900, he joined the Red Cross in September 1918 as an ambulance driver. Conversely, those wishing to avoid conscription may also falsify their age: the birthdate of Henryk Gulbinowicz, Bishop Emeritus of Wroclaw, Poland and a cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church, was changed from 1923 to 1928 by his parents and his parish priest to prevent him from being conscripted during World War II.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13249479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13249479", "title": "Alexis Debat", "text": "Alexis Debat\n\nAlexis Debat (born 1977) is a French commentator on terrorism and national security issues, formerly based in Washington D.C.. He worked as a reporter, consultant, and source for ABC News for six years, as a senior fellow at the Nixon Center, and was a contributing editor to \"The National Interest\". According to \"Mother Jones\", he was the Director of the Terrorism and National Security Program at the Nixon Center. He was also part of the Consulting Committee of the French magazine \"Politique Internationale\", headed by Patrick Wajsman, and worked until September 2007 for the National Security Institute of the George Washington University on Islamist radicalization in Afghanistan since 2005. Since 2003, he has been called an \"expert\" by \"Time\", \"U.S. News & World Report\", \"National Journal\", the \"Boston Herald\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", Associated Press, PBS, etc. He also wrote op-eds in the \"Financial Times\" and the \"International Herald Tribune\".\n\nHowever, he resigned from ABC News in June 2007, after some ABC officials raised questions about his credentials.\nAn in-depth inquiry into his work as a consultant cleared his reporting, according to ABC News President David Westin. That investigation found no instances of false reporting, ABC said, but did uncover four details about operations and meetings in Pakistan that could not be confirmed. \"None of these discrepancies would rise to the level of a formal, on-air retraction because none of them was material to the substance of our report,\" Mr. Westin wrote in an internal memo ABC has however deleted articles by Alexis Debat, replaced by the notice \"This story has been removed from our Web site because of questions raised about the credibility of one of its authors, Alexis Debat.\"\n\nKerry Smith, ABC's senior vice president for editorial quality, who headed up the inquiry, described the process as \"particularly sensitive\" because it involved re-reporting on confidential sources, belonging not just to Mr. Debat but to other, current ABC reporters—reflecting the collective nature of investigative work. At one point, Ms. Smith sent a three-person team, which included an Urdu speaker and producer Rhonda Schwartz, to Pakistan to determine whether Mr. Debat went to the hotels he said he did, and to confirm that he met with the people he said he met with.\n\nIn an interview with \"The New York Observer\" in 2007, Debat said he felt cautiously pleased for himself and for his former colleagues by the results of the inquiry. \"I'm very happy that their collective reputation is salvaged,\" said Mr. Debat.\n\nIn September 2007, the French news media \"Rue 89\" alleged that two interviews, one of Barack Obama and the other of former US Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, both published in the French magazine \"Politique Internationale\", had been fabricated. These allegations in turn led to Debat's voluntary resignation, allegedly for \"personal reasons\", from \"The National Interest\" and the Nixon Center. Many other personalities also since stated that \"Politique Internationale\" published bogus interviews of them. The list included former US President Bill Clinton, US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, former US Secretary of State Colin Powell, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.\n\nAlexis Debat has denied \"Rue 89\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s allegations, and claimed that he was taking steps to charge \"Rue 89\" and Pascal Riché, author of the story, for \"slander. The trial is pending.\" He admitted however having made \"a mistake\" for Obama's interview. On the other hand, Debat also admitted he did not interview Bill Clinton, Pelosi, Bloomberg, Gates, Greenspan or Annan, but that these \"interviews\" were piece together from speeches, with the consent of Patrick Wasjman, the director of \"Politique Internationale\". He has also claimed that \"a technicality\" had prevented the Sorbonne University from issuing his PhD, which he had not been made aware of.\n\nAlexis Debat does not respond anymore at his phone number, and he has left the United States.\n\nDebat was a respected expert on terrorism issues, writing for example on the Jundallah Balochi and Sunni organisation, on the Tabligh organisation, on Iran and many other subjects. Two days before \"Rue 89\" 's revelations, Alexis Debat was the source of a \"Sunday Times\" article claiming that The Pentagon had a \"‘three-day blitz’ plan for Iran\". In an article published by \"National Journal\", Laura Rozen has questioned Debat's account of alleged US support to the Jundallah in purported covert operations against Iran. This ABC report by Debat had itself been angrily denied by Pakistan official sources, ABC later reported. ABC precised that \"ABC News stands by its reporting on this story.\" Laura Rozen then explained that according to the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, partially funded by the US government, Debat had been a paid employee of them, until the controversy lifted by \"Rue 89\". Andrew Krepinevich, head of the conservative think-tank, put the blame on the competitive aspect of medias, recalling : \"\"We had a contract with the Pentagon to do some work...We hired Alexis to support us in that work. His sole arrangement with us was as a consultant.\" \n\nDebat was paid as a \"consultant\" by ABC News, although he also wrote for ABC's \"The Blotter.\"\n\nDebat presented himself as \"former advisor to the French minister of Defense on Transatlantic Affairs,\" \"visiting lecturer at Middlebury College\" and claimed that he was at work on a manuscript on the history of the Central Intelligence Agency. \n\nIn an interview on PBS in Autumn 2005, during the riots in the French suburbs, he was introduced as a former social worker, claiming he had worked in Martine Aubry's foundation, \"Fondation Agir Contre l'Exclusion\" (FACE). On PBS, he claimed that \"what started as isolated clashes quickly became a political opportunity for these people to put their situation at the forefront of the political debate to make headlines with their own situations,\" although he also underlined \"a pervasive, very dark racism in French society that associates the second generation Muslims, these second generation immigrants with trouble.\"\n\nAccording to his (now deleted) online biography at George Washington University's Homeland Security Policy Institute (a US governmental think tank), Debat is additionally claimed to have worked as an analyst for the French government on the Counter-Terrorism Coordinating Committee, as an expert on Islamic finance and Islamic law for clients such as Deutsche Bank and the Japan External Trade Organization, as a contractor for the RAND think tank, as advisor for the Business for Diplomatic Action consortium, and once again for the French government as \"a desk officer for the Ministry of Defense.\"\n\nAccording to Jeffrey Schneider from ABC, suspicions were aroused when the French government, in May 2007, told them that they were skeptical concerning Debat's scholarship credentials. Thereafter, ABC launched an investigation which in June 2007 led to his resignation, before inspecting all of his preceding work for ABC. \"Rue 89\", however, pointed out that according to the French government, ABC was the first to contact the French embassy, and not otherwise. The latter answered them that it was not their job to verify credentials. Thereafter, ABC requested to the French embassy the contacts of the French Minister of Defence in order to verify this point in Debat's Curriculum Vitae. This point was later confirmed by ABC itself, who declared that they had made a mistake. \"Rue 89\" later announced that a whistleblower inside ABC News had launched an unofficial investigation on Debat in May 2007.\n\nFurthermore, two journalists at ABC have claimed that Debat's sensational articles were in fact supported by Brian Ross, ABC chief investigative correspondent. AP news agency has stated that ABC was now sending long time Ross producer Rhonda Schwartz to Pakistan to counter-check Debat's articles. \"Rue 89\", however, questions ABC News' decision to let the control of the investigation to Brian Ross, who was Alexis Debat's direct superior. This inquiry into Debat's work as a consultant cleared his reporting, according to ABC News President David Westin (see above).\n\nAlexis Debat's credentials had been called into question once.\n\nA spokesperson for the French defense Department asked \"Libération\" in September 2002 to run a correction after the French newspaper quoted Debat, presented as an \"official at the French Defense Ministry\", on the role Zacarias Moussaoui played in the September 11 attacks. The defense correspondent in \"Libération\", Jean Dominique Merchet, then published the correction, stating that Debat was not currently a defense official, but had been in the past. The AFP news agency also contradicted ABC News on September 6, 2002 by reporting that Debat (who was then interviewed in the case concerning Zacarias Moussaoui) had never been an \"official\" but a \"desk officer\" at the French Defence Ministry.\nAfter allegedly looking into the matter, ABC News continued to present him as \"former official in the French Minister of Defense\" — according to \"Rue 89\", he did make a brief passage at the \"Délégation aux Affaires stratégiques\" (Delegation of Strategic Affairs).\n\nStéphane Dujarric, chief spokesman for the UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, said he had denounced to Patrick Wajsman, head of \"Politique Internationale\", the bogus interview in June 2005. Despite this warning, Debat continued to be cited by \"Politique Internationale\" as the author of interviews of international level personalities. When asked why he continued to work with Debat, Patrick Wajsman declared that \"Everybody can be trusted once. He seemed to be well-connected in Washington, working for ABC and the Nixon center.\" Debat disputes this, and claims to have evidence that Wasjman asked him to piece together this interview from Annan's speeches.\n\nDebat was cited as primary source for many US news reports on a range of topics since 2001:\n\n\"Replaced by ABC by \"This Story Has Been Removed From the Site\" or \"This story has been removed from our Web site because of questions raised about the credibility of one of its authors, Alexis Debat.\"\"\n\n\n\nPatrick Wajsman, director of \"Politique Internationale\", has now taken out all interviews of the website. Google cache still works for some alleged interviews. Note also that they are some discrepancies in date and issues, these come from the website itself. On its website, \"Politique Internationale\" presents itself as \"the most influential Francophone journal dedicated to international questions.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44655946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44655946", "title": "All Soul's Weekend", "text": "All Soul's Weekend\n\nAll Souls Weekend is an event in Tucson, Arizona. It draws on Mesoamerican, Spanish Roman Catholic, and Mexican rituals, incorporating many diverse cultural traditions with the common goal of honoring and remembering the deceased.\nAll Souls Weekend is more commonly known as All Souls Procession weekend and is derived from the All Souls Procession, an event first initiated and organized in 1990 by Tucson artist Susan Kay Johnson to \"express her sorrow\" over the recent death of her father and to initiate an artistic ritual in honor of the dead in Tucson. Johnson had studied art therapy based in part on the work of Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung including his study of rituals in cultures around the world. After her father died, Johnson planned and invited other artists to participate in a three-day ritual, which lasted from Halloween through All Saints Day and ended on All Souls Day. The ritual took place in public and private spaces in downtown Tucson, and involved art objects Johnson created for the event. These objects included \"a giant fabric-and-wire cocoon big enough to hold 15 masked performers who snaked through the neighborhood and emerged as butterflies to dance to the cue of a flute player.\" By 1991, public interest the ritual led Johnson and other artists to apply for a grant from the Tucson Partnership in order to involve the Tucson community in the event, through free public workshops in art and music followed by a large procession. One of the artists listed on the grant application, Mykl Wells, has reported that he helped Johnson write the 1991 grant application, on which his name is spelled \"Michael Wells.\" Wells has reported that he helped inspire Johnson's initial planning of the 1990 All Souls Procession when he told Johnson about \"Día de los Muertos\" rituals he had witnessed in Guanajuato, Mexico in the 1980s.\nOrganizers of All Souls Weekend have made explicit efforts to present the All Souls Procession and associated events as inclusive of but distinct in origin from \"Día de los Muertos\", partly in response to charges of cultural appropriation by academic critics who have charged that its organizers and participants have primarily been Anglo-Americans. Similar charges have been directed at the Day of the Dead parade in the Mission District in San Francisco. However, with All Souls Weekend events now bringing together over 100,000 people of varying backgrounds in a public celebration in downtown Tucson, the organizers influence but do not control the traditions participants choose to represent and honor in the event. Each year thousands of participants in All Souls Weekend activities choose to wear calavera-style makeup and objects, familiar to many in Tucson due to the city's location 50 miles from the US-Mexico border. After the Spanish conquest of middle America, ancient Mesoamerican rituals merged with Roman Catholic tradition along with modern cultural interests in the Americas, yielding the holiday known today as \"Día de los Muertos\" in Spanish or Day of the Dead in English. At least one writer has argued that All Soul’s Weekend in Tucson represents a further step in the evolution of precolonial Mesoamerican rituals and Day of the Dead. Though there is evidence the All Souls Procession was directly inspired by the history of Day of the Dead, the organizers of the All Soul’s Weekend emphasize that the event includes and encourages all forms of individual expression, drawing from many cultures, religions, and rituals. The mission of the weekend’s primary organizing body, Many Mouths One Stomach (MMOS), includes the perspective that death is a universal experience, uniting deceased loved ones with the living. MMOS intends All Soul’s Weekend to serve as an opportunity to approach death in a safe social setting.\n\nAll Soul’s Weekend culminates with its largest event, a parade called the All Soul’s Procession. According to MMOS, “The All Souls Procession is perhaps one of the most important, inclusive and authentic public ceremonies in North America today.” Participants often dress up, wear masks, paint their faces, create intricate artistic installations, and tow altars, also engaging in numerous other forms of expression in remembrance of the deceased. The deceased may include family, friends, pets, endangered species, fallen heroes, victims of war, or any other group that an individual feels deserving of remembrance. The procession is a forum for the community to engage in open authentic expression of grief, loss, joy, and celebration. The procession is led by a large steel container called The Urn in which procession attendees are invited to place prayers, photographs, and other remembrances of lost loved ones. At the end of the procession, The Urn is set on fire. Burning of The Urn serves the purpose of uniting individual remembrances into a one cathartic communal expression of both grief and celebration honoring lost loved ones.\nAttendance to, and participation in, All Soul’s Weekend is free to the public. The event itself includes no sponsor advertising. MMOS is a non-profit organization funded exclusively by donations. All Soul’s Weekend costs approximately one dollar per attendee. The total cost for the 2014 procession was $109,850. MMOS expresses pride in the community based nature of All Soul’s Weekend and does not intend to seek corporate sponsorship as, “that funding is likely to come with requirements and obligations we are reluctant to take on”. Of all participants in the Procession, an average of 3,000 donate while 97,000 do not. Tax deductible donations from individuals and groups, including businesses and private organizations, may be made to MMOS in support of All Soul’s Weekend.\n\n"}

The musical is Smith's first foray as a professional writer or composer. It is based loosely on the life of John Newton, an English slave trader who later became an Anglican priest and eventually an abolitionist. He wrote many hymns, including \"Amazing Grace\".\n\nThe musical had a 2012 production by Goodspeed Musicals in Connecticut and a pre-Broadway run in Chicago in 2014. It opened on Broadway on July 16, 2015 and closed on October 25, 2015.\n\nIt is nearly Christmas, 1742, and young Englishman John Newton returns from the sea (\"Prologue\"). His childhood friend, Mary Catlett, an aspiring singer, is angry that John abandoned his musical education to seek adventure at sea. John’s father, Captain Newton, a wealthy slave-trader arrives; he is angry that his son has rejected his plans for him (\"Truly Alive\"). John and his friend Haweis begin the day's auction without the Captain. The cargo is African slaves (\"The Auction\"). A commotion ensues when the slave is freed by a group of hooded abolitionists; Mary gives up her cloak to conceal the young woman and aid her escape. John is humiliated and is tasked by Major Gray to find and retrieve the slave. John argues with Mary; he still suffers from the loss of his dear mother at age eight. Mary encourages John's better nature, singing a song he wrote for her years ago (\"Someone Who Hears\"). Mary is secretly invited to join an abolitionist group. She talks with her black maidservant, Nanna, about how Nanna became a slave and lost her daughter (\"Yema's Song\"). Mary's mother encourages her to pursue a relationship with the handsome and aristocratic Major Gray, who is interested in Mary. Mary, John and Gray all attend a Christmas ball where Mary performs a song that John wrote (\"Voices of the Angels\"). John drinks too much and offends everyone, including his father and Mary. Redcoat soldiers drag in two badly beaten abolitionists and the pregnant slave, also beaten. Major Gray scornfully points out that his soldiers, rather than John and his civil authorities, retrieved the slave. Gray leaves with Mary.\n\nThe next day, Mary meets with the abolitionists; they relate plans to undermine the slave trade (\"We Are Determined\"). She agrees to begin a relationship with Major Gray to act as their spy. Meanwhile, John is press-ganged into the Navy aboard the H.M.S. Harwich; When his father refuses to help him, and John breaks all ties with him (\"Never\"). Thomas, the Newton’s house slave, attempts to intercede on John's behalf, and Captain Newton sends him on the ship as well. Mary struggles with her feelings for John (\"Shadows of Innocence\"). At her home, Major Gray proposes to Mary. As a cousin of George II, he must introduce Mary to the King to obtain royal consent to the marriage (\"Expectations\"). John's carelessness allows a French warship to defeat the Harwich, whose crew is killed. John falls into the sea, and Thomas dives in to save his master (\"Battle at Sea\").\n\nJohn and Thomas are captured In Sierra Leone, by African warriors and their Princess Peyai, a ruthless slave trader, who threatens to kill John. John defies her (\"Welcome Song\") and is chained to a post and saved from starvation by a young slave girl, Yema. Meanwhile, Mary performs with the town choir (\"Sing on High\") and learns from Captain Newton that the Harwich has been lost (\"Tell Me Why\"). Peyai sends a letter to Captain Newton demanding ransom. Captain Newton prepares to sail to Sierra Leone (\"A Chance for Me\"), and Mary asks him to give John a letter. John uses his knowledge of the slave business to help Peyai to break up African families and assign slaves to ships. The Princess tests John's loyalty, pressuring him to sell Thomas as a slave bound for Barbados. As he is chained, Thomas confronts John about his choices (\"Nowhere Left to Run\"). Back in England, Major Gray learns that Mary plans to speak against slavery in front of Prince Frederick at the Christmas concert at court, where she has been asked to perform. He imprisons Nanna and threatens to harm her if Mary does anything foolish, but Nanna tells Mary to speak regardless of the Consequences (\"Daybreak\"). Captain Newton reaches Africa to pay the ransom for John, but a gunfight erupts; Peyai is killed, while Captain Newton is gravely wounded and soon dies aboard ship. \n\nJohn assumes the role of Captain and finds Mary's letter inside his father's coat (\"I Still Believe\"). That night, John survives a fierce storm, remaining all night alone on deck, confronted by visions of the many lives he has destroyed (\"Testimony\"). He has an epiphany and turns the ship towards Barbados. He eventually finds and frees Thomas (whose African name is Pakuteh). John tells Pakuteh that he will spend his life working against the slave trade. Pakuteh is reluctant to forgive John (\"I Will Remember\") but relents and goes with him to England. John arrives home; Mary delivers an impassioned plea to Prince Frederick to end the barbarity of slavery. John bolsters her argument, vowing to undo his former evil. The Prince humiliates and demotes Gray. John and Mary reunite (\"Nothing There to Love\"). Pakuteh (Thomas), now a free man, recounts that John and Mary wed, and John went on to write hundreds of hymns (\"Amazing Grace\").\n\n\"Amazing Grace\" was first presented after a number of readings in a developmental production at Goodspeed Musicals in Chester, Connecticut in the summer of 2012. The production was directed by Gabriel Barre and starred Chris Peluso and Whitney Bashor.\n\nThe musical had a pre-Broadway run in the fall of 2014 at the Bank of America Theatre in Chicago, Illinois. The show was again directed by Barre and featured choreography by Christopher Gattelli. This production starred Josh Young as John, alongside Erin Mackey as Mary, Tom Hewitt as Captain Newton, Chuck Cooper as Pakuteh/Thomas, and Stanley Bahorek as Robert Haweis.\n\n\"Amazing Grace\" opened on Broadway on July 16, 2015 at the Nederlander Theatre after 20 preview performances. The production featured the same principal cast and creative team as the Chicago production. It received mixed reviews. The show closed on October 25, 2015 after 116 performances. A cast recording was released in February 2016.\n\n\n\"From the 2015 Broadway production\"\n"}

{"id": "1563497", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1563497", "title": "Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles", "text": "Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles\n\nArticle 231, often known as the War Guilt Clause, was the opening article of the reparations section of the Treaty of Versailles, which ended the First World War between the German Empire and the Allied and Associated Powers. The article did not use the word \"guilt\" but it served as a legal basis to compel Germany to pay reparations for the war.\n\nArticle 231 was one of the most controversial points of the treaty. It specified: \n\nGermans viewed this clause as a national humiliation, forcing Germany to accept full responsibility for causing the war. German politicians were vocal in their opposition to the article in an attempt to generate international sympathy, while German historians worked to undermine the article with the objective of subverting the entire treaty. The Allied leaders were surprised at the German reaction; they saw the article only as a necessary legal basis to extract compensation from Germany. The article, with the signatory's name changed, was also included in the treaties signed by Germany's allies who did not view the clause with the same disdain as the Germans did. American diplomat John Foster Dulles—one of the two authors of the article—later regretted the wording used, believing it further aggravated the German people.\n\nThe historical consensus is that responsibility or guilt for the war was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be laid out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.\n\nOn 28 June 1914 the Bosnian-Serb Gavrilo Princip assassinated the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, in the name of Serbian nationalism. This caused a diplomatic crisis, resulting in Austria-Hungary declaring war on Serbia and sparking the First World War. Due to a variety of reasons, within weeks the major powers of Europe—divided into two alliances known as the Central Powers and the Triple Entente—went to war. As the conflict progressed, additional countries from around the globe became drawn into the conflict on both sides.\n\nFighting would rage across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia for the next four years. On 8 January 1918, United States President Woodrow Wilson issued a statement that became known as the Fourteen Points. In part, this speech called for the Central Powers to withdraw from the territories they had occupied, for the creation of a Polish state, the redrawing of Europe's borders along ethnic (\"national\") lines, and the formation of a League of Nations. During the northern-hemisphere autumn of 1918, the Central Powers began to collapse. The German military suffered a decisive defeat on the Western Front, while on the Home Front the Imperial German Navy mutinied, prompting uprisings in Germany which became known as the German Revolution. The German government attempted to obtain a peace settlement based on the Fourteen Points, and maintained it was on this basis that Germany surrendered. Following negotiations, the Allied Powers and Germany signed an armistice, which came into effect on 11 November while German forces were still positioned in France and Belgium.\n\nOn 18 January 1919 the Paris Peace Conference began. The conference aimed to establish peace between the war's belligerents and to establish the post-war world. The Treaty of Versailles resulting from the conference dealt solely with Germany. This treaty, along with the others that were signed during the conference, each took their name from the suburb of Paris where the signings took place. While 70 delegates from 26 nations participated in the Paris negotiations, representatives from Germany were barred from attending, nominally over fears that a German delegation would attempt to play one country off against the other and unfairly influence the proceedings.\n\nThe Americans, British and French all differed on the issue of reparations settlement. The Western Front had been fought in France, and that countryside had been heavily scarred in the fighting. France's most industrialized region in the north-east had been laid to waste during the German retreat. Hundreds of mines and factories were destroyed along with railroads, bridges and villages. Georges Clemenceau, the Prime Minister of France, thought it appropriate that any just peace required Germany to pay reparations for the damage they had caused. He also saw reparations as a means to ensure that Germany could not again threaten France and as well to weaken the German ability to compete with France's industrialization. Reparations would also go towards the reconstruction costs in other countries, such as Belgium, also directly affected by the war. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George opposed harsh reparations in favour of a less crippling reparations settlement so that the German economy could remain a viable economic power and British trading partner. He furthermore argued that reparations should include war pensions for disabled veterans and allowances to be paid to war widows, which would reserve a larger share of the reparations for the British Empire. Wilson opposed these positions, and was adamant that there be no indemnity imposed upon Germany.\n\nDuring the peace conference the Commission on the Responsibility of the Authors of the War and on Enforcement of Penalties was established to examine the background of the war. The Commission reasoned that the \"war was premeditated by the Central Powers ... and was the result of acts deliberately committed [by them] to make it unavoidable\", concluding that Germany and Austria-Hungary had \"deliberately worked to defeat all the many conciliatory proposals made by the Entente Powers and their repeated efforts to avoid war.\" This conclusion was duly incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles, led by Clemenceau and Lloyd George who were both insistent on the inclusion of an unequivocal statement of Germany's total liability. This left Wilson at odds with the other leaders of the conference. Instead, he proposed a repetition of a note sent by United States Secretary of State Robert Lansing to the German Government on 5 November 1918, stating that the \"Allied Governments ... understand that compensation will be made by Germany for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allies and their property by the aggression of Germany ...\"\n\nThe actual wording of the article was chosen by American diplomats Norman Davis and John Foster Dulles. Davis and Dulles produced a compromise between the Anglo-French and American positions, wording Article 231 and 232 to reflect that Germany \"should, morally, pay for all war costs, but, because it could not possibly afford this, would be asked only to pay for civilian damages.\" Article 231, in which Germany accepted the responsibility of Germany and its allies for the damages resulting from the First World War, therefore served as a legal basis for the articles following it within the reparations chapter, obliging Germany to pay compensation limited to civilian damages. Similar clauses, with slight modification in wording, were present in the peace treaties signed by the other members of the Central Powers.\n\nForeign Minister Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau headed the 180-strong German peace delegation. They departed Berlin on 18 April 1919, anticipating that the peace talks would soon start and that they and the Allied Powers would negotiate a settlement. Earlier, in February of that year, Brockdorff-Rantzau had informed the Weimar National Assembly that Germany would have to pay reparations for the devastation caused by the war, but would not pay for actual war costs. The German government had also taken the position that it would be \"inadvisable ... to elevate the question of war guilt\". On 5 May, Brockdorff-Rantzau was informed that there would be no negotiations. Once the German delegation received the conditions of peace they would have fifteen days to reply. Following the drafting of the treaty, on 7 May the German and Allied delegations met and the Treaty of Versailles was handed off to be translated and for a response to be issued. At this meeting Brockdorff-Rantzau stated that \"We know the intensity of the hatred which meets us, and we have heard the victors' passionate demand that as the vanquished we shall be made to pay, and as the guilty we shall be punished\". However, he proceeded to deny that Germany was solely responsible for the war. Following the meeting, the German delegation retired to translate the 80,000 word document. As soon as the delegation realized the terms of peace, they agreed that they could not accept it without revision. They then proceeded to send their Allied counterparts, message after message attacking each part of the treaty. On 18 June, having disregarded the repeated explicit decisions of the government, Brockdorff-Rantzau declared that Article 231 would have Germany accept full responsibility for the war by force. Max Weber, an advisor with the German delegation, agreed with Brockdorff-Rantzau, also challenging the Allies over the issue of war guilt. He preferred to reject the treaty than submit to what he called a \"rotten peace\".\n\nOn 16 June, the Allied Powers demanded that Germany unconditionally sign the treaty within seven days or face the resumption of hostilities. The German government was divided on whether to sign or reject the peace treaty. On 19 June, Chancellor Philipp Scheidemann resigned rather than sign the treaty and was followed by Brockdorff-Rantzau and other members of the government, leaving Germany without a cabinet or peace delegation. After being advised by Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg that Germany was in no condition to resume the war, President Friedrich Ebert and the new Chancellor, Gustav Bauer, recommended that the Weimar National Assembly ratify the treaty. The Assembly did so by a large majority, and Clemenceau was informed nineteen minutes before the deadline expired. Germany unconditionally signed the peace treaty on 22 June.\n\nInitially, Article 231 was not correctly translated. Rather than stating \"... Germany accepts responsibility of Germany and her allies causing all the loss and damage ...\", the German Government's edition read \"Germany admits it, that Germany and her allies, as authors of the war, are responsible for all losses and damages ...\". Germans felt that they the country had signed away her honor, and there was a prevailing belief of humiliation as the article was seen, overall, as an injustice. Historian Wolfgang Mommsen commented that despite the public outrage, German government officials were aware \"that Germany's position on this matter was not nearly so favorable as the imperial government had led the German public to believe during the war.\"\n\nThe Allied delegation initially thought Article 231 to be a mundane addition to the treaty intended to limit German liability with regard to reparations, and were surprised at the vehemence of the German protests. Georges Clemenceau rebuffed Brockdorff-Rantzau's allegations, arguing that \"the legal interpretation [of the article] was the correct one\" and not a matter of political question. Lloyd George commented that \"the English public, like the French public, thinks the Germans must above all acknowledge their obligation to compensate us for all the consequences of their aggression. When this is done we come to the question of Germany's capacity to pay; we all think she will be unable to pay more than this document requires of her.\"\n\nPrior to the American entry into the war, Woodrow Wilson called for a \"peace of reconciliation with Germany\", what he dubbed a \"peace without victory\". His wartime speeches, however, rejected these earlier notions and he took an increasingly belligerent stance towards Germany. Following the war, on 4 September 1919, during his public campaign to rally American support for the Treaty of Versailles, Wilson commented that the treaty \"seeks to punish one of the greatest wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization, and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for the attempt.\" Regardless of the rhetoric, the American position was to create a balanced treaty that would appease everyone. Gordon Auchincloss, secretary to Edward M. House (one of Wilson's advisers), sent a copy of the clause to the State Department and stated \"you will note that the President's principles have been protected in this clause\".\n\nHistorian William Keylor commented that initially both United States diplomats believed that they had \"devised a brilliant solution to the reparation dilemma\"; appeasing both the British and French, as well as Allied public opinion irrespective of the fact that Allied leaders were aware of concerns surrounding German willingness to pay reparations and the disappointment that could follow. Vance C. McCormick (an economic adviser of Wilson) emphasized this point, and stated: \"...the preamble is useful. We are adopting an unusual method in not fixing a definite sum. The preamble tends to explain this, and further, prepares the public mind for disappointment as to what actually can be secured.\" In 1940, Dulles stated that he was surprised that the article \"could plausibly be, and in fact was, considered to be a historical judgement of war guilt\". He further noted that the \"profound significance of this article ... came about through accident, rather than design\". Dulles took it personally that the Treaty of Versailles failed in its intentions of creating a lasting peace and believed that the treaty was one of the causes of the Second World War. By 1954, as United States Secretary of State and in discussion with the Soviet Union in regards to German reunification, he commented that \"Efforts to bankrupt and humiliate a nation merely incite a people of vigor and of courage to break the bonds imposed upon them. ... Prohibitions thus incite the very acts that are prohibited.\"\n\nCompensation demanded from the defeated party was a common feature of peace treaties. The financial burden of the Treaty of Versailles was labelled \"reparations\", which distinguished them from punitive settlements usually known as indemnities. The reparations were intended for reconstruction and as compensation for families who had been bereaved by the war. Sally Marks wrote that the article \"was designed to lay a legal basis for reparations\" to be paid. Article 231 \"established an unlimited theoretical liability\" for which Germany would have to pay but the following article \"in fact narrowed German responsibility to civilian damages\". When the final reparation figure was established in 1921, it was based on an Allied assessment of [the] German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims.\n\nThe London Schedule of Payments, of 5 May 1921, established the full liability of the combined Central Powers at gold marks. Of this figure, Germany was only required to pay gold marks (), a smaller amount than they had previously offered for terms of peace. Reparations were unpopular and strained the German economy but they were payable and from 1919–1931, when reparations ended, Germany paid fewer than gold marks. The Reparation Commission and the Bank for International Settlements gave a total German payment of gold marks, whereas historian Niall Ferguson estimated that Germany paid no more than gold marks. Ferguson also wrote that this sum was only 2.4 per cent of German national income between 1919 and 1932, while Stephen Schuker places the figure at an average of 2 per cent of national income between 1919 and 1931, in cash and kind, making a total transfer equal to 5.3 per cent of national income for the period. Gerhard Weinberg wrote that reparations were paid, towns were rebuilt, orchards replanted, mines reopened and pensions paid but the burden of repairs was shifted from the German economy to the damaged economies of the victors.\n\nDomestic German opposition to Article 231 has been held to have created a psychological and political burden on the post-war Weimar Republic. German politicians seeking international sympathy would use the article for its propaganda value, convincing many who had not read the treaties that the article implied full war guilt. German revisionist historians who subsequently attempted to ignore the validity of the clause found a ready audience among 'revisionist' writers in France, Britain, and the United States. The objective of both the politicians and historians was to prove that Germany was not solely guilty for causing the war; if that guilt could be disproved the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear. To that end, the German government funded the Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War. This subject, the question of Germany's guilt (\"Kriegsschuldfrage\" or war guilt question) became a major theme of Adolf Hitler's political career. \n\nUnited States Senator Henrik Shipstead argued that the failure to revise the article became a factor in Hitler's rise to power., a view held by some historians, such as Tony Rea and John Wright, who wrote that \"the harshness of the War Guilt Clause and the reparations demands made it easier for Hitler to gain power in Germany.\" Despite these views, the historical consensus is that the article and the treaty, did not cause the rise of Nazism but that an unconnected rise in extremism and the Great Depression led to the NSDAP gaining greater electoral popularity and then being maneuvered into office. Fritz Klein wrote that while there was a path from Versailles to Hitler, the former did not make \"Hitler's takeover of power inevitable\" and that \"the Germans had a choice when they decided to take this path. In other words, they did not have to. Hitler's victory was not an unavoidable result of Versailles.\"\n\nIn 1926, Robert C. Binkley and A. C. Mahr of Stanford University, wrote that German accusations of the article assigning war guilt were \"ill-founded\" and \"mistaken\". The article was more \"an assumption of liability to pay damages than an admission of war guilt\" and compared it with \"a man who undertakes to pay all the cost of a motor accident than to the plea of guilty entered by an accused criminal\". They wrote that \"it is absurd\" to charge the reparation articles of the treaty with any \"political meaning\" and the legal interpretation \"is the only one that can stand\". They concluded that German opposition \"is based upon a text which has no legal validity whatsoever, and which Germany never signed at all.\" Sidney Fay was the \"most outspoken and influential critic\" of the article. In 1928, he concluded that all of Europe shared the blame for the war and that Germany had no intention of launching a general European war in 1914.\n\nIn 1937, E. H. Carr commented that \"in the passion of the moment\" the Allied Powers had \"failed to realize that this extorted admission of guilt could prove nothing, and must excite bitter resentment in German minds.\" He concluded \"German men of learning set to work to demonstrate the guiltlessness of their country, fondly believing that, if this could be established, the whole fabric of the treaty would collapse.\" René Albrecht-Carrié wrote in May 1940, that \"article 231 gave rise to an unfortunate controversy, unfortunate because it served to raise a false issue.\" He wrote that the German inter-war argument \"rested on her responsibility for the out-break of the war\" and if that guilt could be disproved then the legal requirement to pay reparations would disappear.\n\nIn 1942, Luigi Albertini published \"The Origins of the War of 1914\" and concluded that Germany was primarily responsible for the outbreak of the war. Albertini's work, rather than spurring on new debate, was the culmination of the first research phase into the war guilt question. The issue came back between 1959 and 1969, when Fritz Fischer in \"Germany's Aims in the First World War\" and \"War of Illusions\" \"destroyed the consensus about shared responsibility for the First World War\" and \"placed the blame ... firmly on the shoulders of the Wilhelmine elite.\" By the 1970s, his work \"had emerged as the new orthodoxy on the origins of the First World War\". In the 1980s, James Joll led a new wave of First World War research concluding \"that the origins of the First World War were \"complex and varied\" although \"by December 1912\" Germany had decided to go to war.\n\nIn 1978, Marks re-examined the reparation clauses of the treaty and wrote that \"the much-criticized 'war guilt clause', Article 231, which was designed to lay a legal basis for reparations, in fact makes no mention of war guilt\" but only specified that Germany was to pay for the damages caused by the war they imposed upon the allies and \"that Germany committed an act of aggression against Belgium is beyond dispute\". \"Technically, Britain entered\" the war and French troops entered Belgium \"to honor\" the \"legal obligation\" to defend Belgium under the 1839 Treaty of London and that \"Germany openly acknowledged her responsibility in regard to Belgium on August 4, 1914 and May 7, 1919.\" Marks also wrote that \"the same clause, \"mutatis mutandis\"\" was incorporated \"in the treaties with Austria and Hungary, neither of whom interpreted it as declaration of war guilt.\" Wolfgang Mommsen wrote that \"Austria and Hungary, understandably paid no attention to this aspect of the draft treaty\".\n\nIn 1986, Marks wrote that the German foreign office, supported by military and civilian notables, \"focused on Article 231 ... hoping that, if one could refute German responsibility for the war, not only reparations but the entire treaty would collapse\". Manfred Boemeke, Gerald Feldman, and Elisabeth Glaser wrote that \"pragmatic requirements characteristically influenced the shaping of the much misunderstood Article 231. That paragraph reflected the presumed legal necessity to define German responsibility for the war in order to specify and limit the Reich's obligations\". P.M.H. Bell wrote that despite the article not using the term 'guilt', and while \"it may be that its drafters did not intend to convey a moral judgement of Germany\", the article has \"almost universally\" became known as the war guilt clause of the treaty. Margaret MacMillan wrote that the German public's interpretation of Article 231 as unequivocally ascribing the fault for the war to Germany and her allies, \"came to be the object of particular loathing in Germany and the cause of uneasy consciences among the Allies.\" The Allies never expected such a hostile reaction, for \"no one thought there would be any difficulty over the clauses themselves.\"\n\nStephen Neff wrote that \"the term 'war guilt' is a slightly unfortunate one, since to lawyers, the term 'guilt' primarily connotes criminal liability\" while \"the responsibility of Germany envisaged in the Versailles Treaty ... was civil in nature, comparable to the indemnity obligation of classical just-war theory.\" Louise Slavicek wrote that while \"the article was an honest reflection of the treaty-writers' beliefs, including such a clause in the peace settlement was undiplomatic, to say the least.\" Diane Kunz wrote that \"rather than being seen as an American lawyer's clever attempt to limit actual German financial responsibility by buying off French politicians and their public with the sop of a piece of paper\" Article 231 \"became an easily exploitable open sore\". Ian Kershaw wrote that the \"national disgrace\" felt over the article and \"defeat, revolution, and the establishment of democracy\", had \"fostered a climate in which a counter-revolutionary set of ideas could gain wide currency\" and \"enhanced the creation of a mood in which\" extreme nationalist ideas could gain a wider audience and take hold.\n\nElazar Barkan argues that by \"forcing an admission of war guilt at Versailles, rather than healing, the victors instigated resentment that contributed to the rise of Fascism.\" Norman Davies wrote that the article invited Germany \"to accept sole guilt for the preceding war\". Klaus Schwabe wrote that the article's influence went far beyond the discussion of war guilt. By \"refusing to acknowledge Germany's 'war guilt' the new German government implicitly exonerated the old monarchial order\" and more importantly failed \"to dissociate itself from the old regime.\" In doing so \"it undermined its claim that post-revolutionary Germany was a historic new democratic beginning deserving credit at the peace conference.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3116412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3116412", "title": "Australian International Airshow", "text": "Australian International Airshow\n\nThe Australian International Airshow, also called the Avalon Airshow, is a large air show held biennially at Avalon Airport, between Melbourne and Geelong in Victoria.\n\nThe event has a strong focus on military aviation, featuring aircraft from the Royal Australian Air Force, United States Navy and the United States Air Force. Representatives from other air arms have also appeared at the airshow on many occasions, including aircraft from the Royal Air Force, Japan Air Self-Defense Force, Republic of Singapore Air Force and many others.\n\nIt has been said by air show organisers to be the largest air show in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe airshow has periodically attracted anti-war protests.\n\nThe first air display at Avalon was in 1957 when the head of the Port Melbourne Government Aircraft Factories Geoff J. Churcher OAM decided to put on a display for the employees. As the employees at the factory only ever saw individual parts of aircraft it was decided to mount a flying display at Avalon so the employees could see the final result of their work.\n\nTo celebrate the Australian Bicentenary in 1988, the first major airshow in Australia was held in Sydney at the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) air base at Richmond in New South Wales. It was organised by members of the Schofields Flying Club, which had been running small-scale air shows at the small strip at Schofields Airfield. The Bicentennial Airshow featured a vast array of international military types including the F-15 Eagle, Panavia Tornado F3, Sea Harrier, the Royal New Zealand Air Force aerobatic team \"Kiwi Red\", Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, BAE Systems Hawk and a flypast by a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber.\n\nIn February 1991 a second air show was held at Richmond, to celebrate the RAAF's 80th Anniversary. This was the last air show run by the remnants of Schoe's, who provided the prime impetus to get the Aerospace Foundation of Australia up and running. The foundation was responsible for forming AirShows DownUnder.\n\nWith the success of those two New South Wales shows plans were laid for the Avalon airshow.\n\nIn 1992, the Australian International Airshow was moved to Avalon Airport near Geelong. Held during October, the show coincided with the wettest spring in Victoria's history. The show organisers nearly cancelled it due to the wet, but the rain stopped just before the opening day. The two public days of the 1992 show were attended by about 175,000 people. There were 226 exhibitors from 12 countries. The move to Avalon in 1992 was hoped to be the first of many locations, however the weather caused financial difficulties that resulted in the air show remaining at Avalon for many years.\n\nBesides the weather, further problems presented themselves, including the absence of the MiG-29 and Sukhoi Su-27 promised by the Russians. However, other aircraft were present, notably the enormous Antonov An-124 Ruslan and Ilyushin Il-86. Also on display were warbirds, and the Airbus A340, which had been in commercial service for only seven months. The show featured significant RAAF participation.\n\nThe 1995 show was the second edition to take place at Avalon. The date was moved from October to 21–26 March, taking advantage of finer weather during autumn.\n\nThe show was largely stolen by the visiting Russian contingent of Anatoly Kvochur, his specially modified Su-27P \"Flanker\" and Ilyushin Il-78 \"Midas\" tanker aircraft. They were supported by other Soviet/Russian aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-76DMP, Il-96M and the Tupolev Tu-204. Also present were the RAAF's General Dynamics F-111G \"Aardvark\", so were the BAE Systems Hawk, Dassault Alpha Jet, CASA/IPTN CN-235, and the Kaman Seasprite, which were running for Australian Defence Force orders. Aerial in-flight refuelling was displayed as well as Kvochur's world-famous flying routine with the Flanker which involved the \"Cobra\", knife-edge and extremely low level passes. The final display on the Sunday show saw the Flanker cruise down the Avalon runway at approximately above ground level. The RAAF and USAF were reluctant to compete with the Flanker and so there was no solo F/A-18 Hornet aerobatic display. The USAF flew the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon with external drop tanks fitted which they said limited the aircraft to a \"3g max\" display. Kvochur won the award for best flying display this year.\n\nThe 1997 Avalon air show was held between 18 and 23 February. In contrast to the 1992 show, which was the wettest spring in Victorian history, 1997 took place during the hottest February ever. Attendance was 171,168 and a $63 million contribution to the Victorian economy.\n\nAircraft present were the USAF F-16 Fighting Falcon, KC-135 Stratotanker and C-17 Globemaster III, a Canadian CP-140 Aurora, a United States Marine Corps Super Cobra, a special Airbus A320 in Sydney Olympics livery, and two Canadair CL-215 Scoopers. The most notable aircraft was a Super Constellation restored by HARS in the US. Another display was by the F-111 with its \"dump and burn\" during the Night Alight on Friday evening.\n\nThere were 472 exhibitors from 26 countries in 1999. It was opened by the-then Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett on 16 February 1999. The USAF again had a heavy presence, contributing two F-16Cs, a KC-135R tanker, a C-5 Galaxy, and a B-52. The latter was parked at the end of the runway, ready to take off at a moment's notice for deployment in Iraq. The RAAF displayed its new Lockheed Martin C-130J-30 Super Hercules, even though it was yet to enter service. Eurofighter sent a mock-up of its Typhoon, promoting the aircraft as prospective replacement for the RAAF's F/A-18 Hornet. Business jets, warbirds and historic aircraft were featured heavily, among which were five North American P-51 Mustangs.\n\nNovelty acts included wing-walking as part of the performances under the name \"Stars of Oshkosh\". Bob Hoover returned to perform in his Aero Commander.\n\nIt was held on 11–17 February 2001, which celebrated Australia's 100 years of federation and 80 years of the Royal Australian Air Force. About 100 United States Air Force pilots took part in the air show in 2001. Planes included were a B-1 Lancer, two F-15 Eagles, two F-16 Fighting Falcons, a B-52 Stratofortress, a C-17 Globemaster III, a Hawker Siddeley Nimrod, two Tornado GR.1s, a Vickers VC10 tanker, two RAF Hercules, and a Eurocopter Tiger, among others. The Bombardier CRJ700, Dash-8 (Q400) and Learjet 45 made their AIA debut, accompanied by a Cessna CJ2, Dassault Falcon 900EX and Cirrus SR20.\n\nThis edition saw the last public display of the RAAF's Aermacchi MB-326 jet trainer before retirement.\n\nIn 2003, the official theme was \"Celebrating the Centenary of Powered Flight\", commemorating the first powered flight by the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903 at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. There were 440 exhibitors from 30 countries. There were more than six hundred aircraft on the field. It included replicas from the early 20th century, such as a 1910 Hanriot replica and 1911 Curtiss Model D Pusher replica. There were also Tiger Moths, Sopwith Pup, Bleriot XI and a scale version of a Wright Flyer II and other similar aircraft. For jets it had a Canberra, MiG-15, Hawker Hunter, Gloster Meteor and Vampire. A NH90 arrived in an Airbus Beluga, which was an attraction in itself.\n\nA Chinese military delegation was given a tour of the air show. The 2003 edition took place in the lead-up to the Iraq War which began the following month and appearances by a number of American aircraft scheduled to join in the show such as the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk were cancelled, due to possible anti-war protests. There was a model of an F-35 Lightning II, made of wood and fibreglass. An anti-war protest did take place outside, and Gavan O'Connor, the local parliament member boycotted the airshow.\n\nThe theme of the 2005 show, held from 15 to 20 March, was \"The Shape of Things to Come\". This edition experienced increased business activity, as there were more than 500 exhibitors from 22 countries and 11 major conferences. The air show increased Geelong's economy by $15.6 million.\n\nIt featured many planes ranging from ultralights to large military aircraft, such as the F/A-18 Hornet, F-15 Eagle, B-52 Stratofortress (a surprise flyover), F-15 Eagle, F-16 Fighting Falcon, General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark, P-51 Mustang, C-130J, Seahawk, Caribou, Orion and CAC Boomerang. A specially painted RAAF F/A-18 Hornet was present was the show, commemorating 20 years of service with Australia\n\nThe theme of the 2007 air show, held between 20 and 25 March, was \"Breaking the Barriers\", as it was the 60th anniversary of the breaking of the sound barrier by Charles \"Chuck\" Yeager; Yeager himself was the guest of honour at the show, and a full-scale mockup of the Bell X-1 was specially constructed. During the show, 611 companies from 20 countries exhibited their products. The total for featured aircraft during the show was 457, during which 182,769 visitors attended. This edition injected A$120 million into the Victorian economy, creating 1,800 jobs.\n\nIt was also the 60th year of the United States Air Force, which once again featured prominently at the event, sending the F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, E-3 Sentry and a C-17 Globemaster III. The F/A-18F Super Hornet display was made possible by United States Navy aircraft from VFA-102 off of the USS \"Kitty Hawk\". Besides those from the USAF, other military aircraft featured included the F/A-18 Hornet, General Dynamics F-111, F/A-18F Super Hornet, BAe Hawk 127, C-27J Spartan and C-130 Hercules, along with military helicopters including the S-70 Black Hawk and Eurocopter Tiger. The RAAF's first C-17 Globemaster III transport was on display and there was a USAF B-52 bomber flyover. The Roulettes, the RAAF's aerobatic display team, also took part in their Pilatus PC-9 aircraft. A large number of civil aircraft were on display, which included modern-day light and sports aircraft, along with jet airliners including the Airbus A320, Boeing 737 and Boeing 747. A large number of warbirds and older aircraft also took part, such as the P-51 Mustang, P-40 Kittyhawk, Douglas DC-3 and Lockheed Super Constellation.\n\nThe show also saw the appearance of three-time world aerobatic champion Yurgis Kairis, test pilot Ricardo Traven, who piloted the F/A-18, and American stunt pilot Jim LeRoy. Jim would die on 28 July later in the year during a helicopter transit following a crash at the Vectren Dayton Air Show.\nBob Carlton made his debut appearance in the Super Salto Jet Sailplane.\n\nThe 2009 air show was held from 10 to 15 March. Trade sessions ran from Tuesday until 2 pm Friday, after which it was opened for the public until Sunday. The theme of this edition was \"Towards Tomorrow\". Andy Thomas, an Australian-born astronaut, was the guest of honour; the edition also remembered the 40th anniversary of the first moon landing. Andy grew up in Adelaide, while the American space programme was still in its infancy. The edition would be the last featuring the F-111 Aardvark, as the RAAF retired the aircraft in December 2010, replaced by the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. Approximately 165,000 people turned out to the six-day-long event.\nAircraft that visited the show were Qantas' Boeing 747 and Airbus A380, the latter of which was first delivered the previous year. V Australia, a new Brisbane-based competitor in the international market, contributed with its Boeing 777-300ER. Also on display were the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, C-17, B1-B Lancer, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, F/A-18F Super Hornet, F-111 Aardvark, and the KC-10 Extender.\n\nThe wall of fire display was not present this year, out of respect to the many people affected by the Victorian bushfires. Furthermore, the show would donate $250,000 to fund research into aviation technology aimed at bushfire management. Much of the Sunday show was cancelled due to severe weather, with several tents and temporary structures blown away by strong winds and extensive damage to some visiting aircraft. In total, 562 part took in the show, with an attendance of 170,045 during the entire show. Ticket sales were the same as 2007 despite the windy and rainy weather. The 2009 show boosted the Victorian economy by $121 million. The following year, officials announced the Australian International Airshow would remain at Avalon until 2015.\n\nThe 2011 Australian International Airshow was the tenth edition to take place at Avalon. It celebrated the 90th anniversary of the Royal Australian Air Force and the centenary of the first passenger flight in Australia. The show ran from 1 to 6 March and opened to the public on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The \"Friday Night Alight\" show featured, for the first time, a laser show and flare drops, during which military jets and gliders performed aerobatic displays. More than 195,000 attended the event.\n\nThere were about 100 aircraft, including bombers, fighters and surveillance aircraft present at this edition. The show saw the premiere of the most advanced stealth air superiority fighter, the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. Two aircraft, based at Elmendorf Air Force Base, were on static display for the first time in Australia, . They did not perform because the qualified display pilot was not present. A highly detailed model of the still under development Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter was on static display beside a classic F/A-18 Hornet. Also present were a B-1B Lancer, KC-135, KC-10, F-16 Fighting Falcon, C-17 Globemaster III, MH-60R Sea Hawk, B-52 bomber, the RAAF's C130H and J Hercules, F/A-18 Classic Hornet and Super Hornets and Boeing 737 AEW&C \"Wedgetail\", a Royal Air Force's E-3 Sentry, as well as aircraft and flying performances from New Zealand, France, Italy and Singapore.\n\nThe RAAF Roulettes were also present with flying displays towards the end of the show. Helicopters were present from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Navy, including the new MRH-90, along with legacy Blackhawks, Sea King and Squirrel models. A Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber was scheduled to participate, but was not present. Conversely, a restored Lockheed Constellation was present. A large contingency of executive jets were also on display, most notably the $54 million Bombardier Global Express XRS.\n\nA major highlight of the 2013 Australian International Airshow at Avalon was the flying display by a United States Air Force Lockheed Martin F-22A Raptor. Almost 168,000 people attended the six day event, held between 26 February and 5 March, with the first three days being taken up with the trade show and the public spectacle began with the ‘Friday Night Alight’ show on the Friday evening. More than 600 aircraft participated in Avalon 2013, either directly or indirectly.\n\nTwo F-22A Raptors from the 94th ‘Hat in the Ring’ Fighter Squadron arrived at Avalon direct from Japan, where they had been forward-deployed. The flying display, performed by the Air Combat Command Raptor Demonstration Team’s Major Henry ‘Schadow’ Schantz, was the only display for 2013, due to the effects of sequestration on the US Air Force budget. Other US military aircraft attending Avalon 2013 included a Boeing B-52H Stratofortress from the 2nd Bomb Wing, two Lockheed Martin F-16C Fighting Falcons from the 35th Fighter Wing and a Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker from the 18th Wing on static display. A Boeing C-17A Globemaster III from the 15th Wing performed a regular flying display, as did an RAAF 36 Squadron C-17A.\n\nThe Royal Australian Air Force had a strong presence at Avalon 2013, including a four-ship display by the Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets of No. 82 Wing. Examples of most RAAF aircraft were on static display, including the Boeing E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning & Control aircraft and Airbus KC-30A Multi-Role Tanker Transport. Making their debut at an Australian airshow was the Japan Air Self Defence Force, (JASDF) with the brief appearance of a Boeing KC-767J tanker from 404 Hikotai/1 Yuso Kokutai during the trade days.\n\nOther highlights included the popular Breitling Wingwalkers with their two Boeing PT-17 Stearman biplanes, although they were reduced to a single aircraft after one suffered an engine failure during the display on the trade days. Melissa Pemberton (Edge 540) and Skip Stewart (Pitts Special) combined with the pyrotechnics of Rich Gibson in the TinStix of Dynamite routine. Large corporate jets were prominent during the trade show, with the Airbus A319CJ, Embraer Lineage 1000 and Gulfstream 650 all making their debut at an Australian International Airshow.\n\nThe 2015 Australian International Airshow was held at Avalon between 24 February and 1 March. The theme was ‘A Centenary of Anzac 1915 – 2015, Heroes of the Sky.’ More than 600 firms were expected to attend the event.\n\n2015 marked the centenary of the formation of the Australia and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) and their landing at Gallipoli. 2015. The Main attractions present at the 2015 air show included the F/A-18, the B-52H, a new addition to the airshow: the HARS Lockheed P-2 as well as multiple future RAAF aircraft.\n\nThe Australian Army flew their MRH90 Taipan and Tiger ARH helicopters for the first time. The Republic of Singapore Air Force display team Black Knights performed a two-ship F-16 display routine. A large number of warbirds and other historical aircraft also participated in the event.\n\nQantas showed off their newest Boeing 737 \"Retro Roo\" and a new aboriginal F/A-18 scheme was released. A JASDF KC-767J refueler made an appearance again during the trade days, leaving on the first full public day.\n\nThe 2017 Australian International Airshow was held between 28 February and 5 March at Avalon. It was noteworthy for the first appearances of many new RAAF types, as well as a large number of US aircraft.\n\nThe 2017 edition featured the first Australian appearance of the RAAF's new Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lightning and the E/A-18 Growlers. It also featured new C-27J Spartan, P-8 Poseidon, and PC-21 RAAF aircraft.\n\nFourteen US military aircraft attended the airshow, the largest amount of US aircraft in the show's history. 2017 marked the second appearance of the USAF's Lockheed F-22 Raptors, and also a return of the Rockwell B-1B Lancer, Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker and two General-Dynamics F-16s. A P-8 from the US Navy was also present.\n\nRegular aircraft such as the Lockheed C-130, C-17 Globemaster III and the RAAF Roulettes were also present.\n\nOther participating countries included the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) with a KC-135 Stratotanker, two McDonnell Douglas F-15s and a C-130. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force again sent a KC-767, and the Royal Air Force sent an Airbus A400M Atlas to participate.\n\nIn terms of attendance the 2017 edition of the airshow was the largest yet, with more than 210,000 people attending.\n\nThere was a small anti-war protest nearby.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "395046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=395046", "title": "Boiling frog", "text": "Boiling frog\n\nThe boiling frog is a fable describing a frog being slowly boiled alive. The premise is that if a frog is put suddenly into boiling water, it will jump out, but if the frog is put in tepid water which is then brought to a boil slowly, it will not perceive the danger and will be cooked to death. The story is often used as a metaphor for the inability or unwillingness of people to react to or be aware of sinister threats that arise gradually rather than suddenly.\n\nWhile some 19th-century experiments suggested that the underlying premise is true if the heating is sufficiently gradual, according to contemporary biologists the premise is false: a frog that is gradually heated will jump out. Indeed, thermoregulation by changing location is a fundamentally necessary survival strategy for frogs and other ectotherms.\n\nAs part of advancing science, several experiments observing the reaction of frogs to slowly heated water took place in the 19th century. In 1869, while doing experiments searching for the location of the soul, German physiologist Friedrich Goltz demonstrated that a frog that has had its brain removed will remain in slowly heated water, but an intact frog attempted to escape the water when it reached 25 °C.\n\nOther 19th century experiments were purported to show that frogs did not attempt to escape gradually heated water. An 1872 experiment by Heinzmann was said to show that a normal frog would not attempt to escape if the water was heated slowly enough, which was corroborated in 1875 by Fratscher.\n\nIn 1888, Sedgwick said the apparent contradiction between the results of these experiments was a consequence of different heating rates used in the experiments: \"The truth appears to be that if the heating be sufficiently gradual, no reflex movements will be produced even in the normal frog; if it be more rapid, yet take place at such a rate as to be fairly called 'gradual', it will not secure the response of the normal frog under any circumstances\". Goltz had raised the temperature of the water from 17.5 °C to 56 °C in about ten minutes, or 3.8 °C per minute, in his experiment, whereas Heinzmann heated the frogs over the course of 90 minutes from about 21 °C to 37.5 °C, a rate of less than 0.2 °C per minute. In \"On the Variation of Reflex Excitability in the Frog induced by changes of Temperature\" (1882) William Thompson Sedgwick writes: \"in one experiment by Scripture the temperature was raised at a rate of 0.002°C per second, and the frog was found dead at the end of 2½ hours without having moved.\"\n\nModern scientific sources report that the alleged phenomenon is not real. In 1995, Professor Douglas Melton, of the Harvard University Biology department, said, \"If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die. If you put it in cold water, it will jump before it gets hot—they don't sit still for you.\" Dr. George R. Zug, curator of reptiles and amphibians at the National Museum of Natural History, also rejected the suggestion, saying that \"If a frog had a means of getting out, it certainly would get out.\"\n\nIn 2002 Dr. Victor H. Hutchison, Professor Emeritus of Zoology at the University of Oklahoma, with a research interest in thermal relations of amphibians, said that \"The legend is entirely incorrect!\" He described how a critical thermal maximum for many frog species has been determined by contemporary research experiments: as the water is heated by about 2 °F, or 1.1 °C, per minute, the frog becomes increasingly active as it tries to escape, and eventually jumps out if the container allows it.\n\nThe boiling frog story is generally offered as a metaphor cautioning people to be aware of even gradual change lest they suffer eventual undesirable consequences. It may be invoked in support of a slippery slope argument as a caution against creeping normality. It is also used in business to reinforce that change needs to be gradual to be accepted. Oppositely, the expression \"boiling frog syndrome\" is sometimes used as shorthand to invoke the pitfalls of standing pat.\n\nThe story has been retold many times and used to illustrate widely varying viewpoints. Among them: in 1960 about sympathy towards the Soviet Union during the Cold War; in 1980 about the impending collapse of civilization anticipated by survivalists; in the 1990s about inaction in response to climate change and staying in abusive relationships. It has also been used by libertarians to warn about slow erosion of civil rights.\n\nIn the 1996 novel \"The Story of B\", environmentalist author Daniel Quinn spends a chapter on the metaphor of the boiling frog, using it to describe human history, population growth and food surplus. Pierce Brosnan's character Harry Dalton mentioned it in the 1997 disaster movie \"Dante's Peak\" in reference to the accumulating warning signs of the volcano's reawakening. Al Gore used a version of the story in a New York Times op ed, in his presentations and the 2006 movie \"An Inconvenient Truth\" to describe ignorance about global warming. In the movie version the frog is rescued before it is harmed. This use of the story was referenced by writer/director Jon Cooksey in the title of his 2010 comedic documentary \"How to Boil a Frog\".\n\nLaw professor and legal commentator Eugene Volokh commented in 2003 that regardless of the behavior of real frogs, the boiling frog story is useful as a metaphor, comparing it to the metaphor of an ostrich with its head in the sand. Economics Nobel laureate and \"New York Times\" op-ed writer Paul Krugman used the story as a metaphor in a July 2009 column, while pointing out that real frogs behave differently. Journalist James Fallows has been advocating since 2006 for people to stop retelling the story, describing it as a \"stupid canard\" and a \"myth\". But following Krugman's column, he declared \"peace on the boiled frog front\" and said that using the story is fine as long as you point out it's not literally true.\n\nIn philosophy the boiling frog story has been used as a way of explaining the sorites paradox. It describes a hypothetical heap of sand from which individual grains are removed one at a time, and asks if there is a specific point when it can no longer be defined as a heap.\n\n"}

The main purpose is to gather artists, musicians, authors, and to exhibit the folkloric and artistic manifestations of the Caribbean and Latin American region.\n\nThe first Caribbean Festival of Arts took place in 1972. This event was organized by Guyana's then President Forbes Burnham, based on a similar event that took place in Puerto Rico in 1952. He held a number of conferences with Caribbean artists and writers that eventually led to the first Carifesta.\n\nCARIFESTA was conceived out of an appeal from a regional gathering of artists who were at the time participating in a Writers and Artists Convention in Georgetown, Guyana, in 1970 and which coincided with Guyana’s move to Republican status.\n\nThe three main considerations with regard to the festival were:\n\nIt is a celebration of the ethnic and racial diversity which separately and collectively created cultural expressions that are wonderfully unique to the Caribbean.\n\nThe cultural village life of CARIFESTA is intended to be a mixture of the States of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM); the wider Caribbean, Latin America; and a representation of Africa, Asia, Europe and North America\nIt is a vision of the peoples with roots deep in Asia, Europe and Africa, coming together to perform their art forms and embracing literature inspired by the Caribbean’s own peculiar temperament; paintings drawn from the awe inspiring tropical ecology; and the visionary inheritance of our forefathers\n\nAccording to the CARICOM Organisation, CARIFESTA aims to:\n\nDescribed as something of an artistic and cultural \"Olympics\" observed by both regional and international states, the festival includes both a cultural opening and closing ceremony with many diverse events in between, including:\n\nDrama - ranging from elaborate musical productions to comedy, fantasy, ritual, history, folk plays and legend.\n\nMusic - concerts, recitals and musical shows provide tantalising folk rhythms, soul-searching jazz, as well as pop, classics and ballet. There are Indian tablas, African drums, Caribbean steel pan, piano, violin, flute and guitar - in other words, music for every taste.\n\nVisual Art - exhibitions of sculpture, graphics, paintings, drawings, and photographs are a visual testimony of each country's art forms.\n\nLiterature - an anthology of new writing from the Caribbean region is produced for CARIFESTA, and authors often launch their works at the festivals. There are also poetry recitals and lecture discussions at universities and Conference centres.\n\nFolklore - groups from over a dozen countries reveal the colour and the mystery of Caribbean and Latin American folklore and legend, among them the Conjunto Folklorico Nacionale of Cuba, the Ol'Higue and Baccos of Guyana, Shango dancers from Trinidad, Shac Shac musicians from Dominica.\n\nCrafts - among the unusual events at CARIFESTA will be live demonstrations of ceramics, wood carving, painting and drawing.\n\nDance - this part of the programme is all-embracing and covers courtly Javanese dancing, intricate ballet, earthy folk plays, dramatic modern choreography, classical Indian movements, spontaneous improvisations and pop.\n\nHeritage Exhibitions - host countries such as Guyana and Suriname that boast diverse heritage showcase cultural exhibits and anthropological studies of the indigenous people.\n\nFamily Life - CARIFESTA usually includes \"Kid Zones\" and family workshops to educate and entertain families.\n\nThe last host of the festival was Guyana in 2008. Suriname has taken up the challenge of hosting the event in 2013 for the second time under the theme \"Culture for Development\".\n\nCarifesta now falls under a regional initiative to develop cultural events. In 2008 a task force was set up \"...to develop a comprehensive Regional Development Strategy and Action Plan for the Cultural Industries in CARICOM. This Task Force was also to make recommendations for an appropriate incentives regime and financing mechanism for the cultural industries, among other developmental areas to be addressed.\"\nDr Hilary Brown, CARICOM Secretariat’s Programme Manager for Culture and Community Development, made this announcement at the 21st Meeting of the Regional Cultural Committee (RCC), which opened at the Courtyard Marriott in Paramaribo, Suriname, on Thursday, December 1. She explained that the RCC would discuss with Suriname, plans for CARIFESTA XI, starting with logistic and promotional arrangements.\n“The Caribbean Community welcomes the offer of the Government of Suriname to host CARIFESTA XI in 2013 and we are all looking forward to the event with great anticipation, she stated,” noting that CARICOM was at a “crossroads in the development of this highly valued regional expose’ of Caribbean arts and culture.”\n\nIt will be the first time the Dutch-speaking CARICOM country will host the event under the new model prescribed in the strategic plan developed in 2004. The new approach provides more opportunities for professional and artistic development for the region’s artists. The plan proposes that CARIFESTA is geared toward inclusion and creating legacy.\n\nApart from the 15-member CARICOM grouping, the event plans to attract countries of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), of which Suriname has recently become a full member. President Dési Bouterse was adamant that in the spirit of globalisation more than 40 Latin American countries would also take part - the highest amount of participating nations in CARIFESTA history. He anticipates that Suriname will host more than 2,000 participants, given the fact that the contingents from each country should number at least 50.\n\nHost city Paramaribo prepares to welcome painters, sculptors, theatrical artists, musicians, dancers and arts and craftsmen. The festival will be held in the historic wooden inner city of Paramaribo and the organisers say “from the Independence Square and the Presidential Palace, down to the heart of town, people are supposed to feel that CARIFESTA is in town. Paramaribo is going to be a Festival City that week”.\n\nSuriname plans to host premier CARIFESTA events such as a Curry-Duck Fest and a Rum Festival featuring all rums of the region, with bartenders mixing up their cocktails.\n\nIn accordance with the advice given by the CARICOM Secretariat, Suriname has budgeted US$5 million for the event, knowing that the cost could increase. The Management Team are looking to various sponsors including the mobile phone companies operating in Suriname as well as the state oil company Staatsolie and gold miner Iamgold to provide much needed funds.\n\nTheatres, exhibition halls, galleries and centres are having infrastructural \"face lifts\" as the country invites the world to the largest Cultural exhibition.\nNational carrier Surinam Airways and Dutch airline KLM are being approached to provide special rates for participants from the Netherlands which will open CARIFESTA's arms to Europe.\n\nThe Bahamas has received negative reviews for failing to host the festivals twice. Once in 2008 when Guyana took up the challenge and again in 2010 when they had shown no intentions of hosting it. The future of CARIFESTA seems to be strengthening as Haiti bids to host the event in 2015.\n\nDuring an address at the 33rd Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Caribbean Community, hosted in July 2012 in Saint Lucia, Haitian President Michel Martelly asserted that receiving CARIFESTA in his country would make it possible to increase cultural relations with other neighbouring nations.\n\n"}

{"id": "11069849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11069849", "title": "Disappearance of Madeleine McCann", "text": "Disappearance of Madeleine McCann\n\nMadeleine Beth McCann (born 12 May 2003) disappeared on the evening of 3 May 2007 from her bed in a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, a resort in the Algarve region of Portugal, sparking what one newspaper called \"the most heavily reported missing-person case in modern history\". Her whereabouts remain unknown.\n\nMadeleine was on holiday from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann; her two-year-old twin siblings; and a group of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a restaurant 55 metres (180 ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine's mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given \"arguido\" (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal's attorney general archived the case in July 2008 because of a lack of evidence.\n\nThe parents continued the investigation using private detectives until Scotland Yard opened its own inquiry, Operation Grange, in 2011. The senior investigating officer announced that he was treating the disappearance as \"a criminal act by a stranger\", most likely a planned abduction or burglary gone wrong. In 2013, Scotland Yard released e-fit images of men they wanted to trace, including one of a man seen carrying a child toward the beach that night. Shortly after this, the Portuguese police reopened their inquiry. Operation Grange was scaled back in 2015, but the remaining detectives continued to pursue a small number of inquiries described in April 2017 as significant.\n\nThe disappearance attracted sustained international interest and saturation coverage in the UK reminiscent of the death of Diana in 1997. The McCanns were subjected to intense scrutiny and baseless allegations of involvement in their daughter's death, particularly in the tabloid press and on Twitter. In 2008 they and their travelling companions received damages and apologies from Express Newspapers, and in 2011 the McCanns testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press misconduct, lending support to those arguing for tighter press regulation.\n\nMadeleine was born in Leicester and lived with her family in Rothley, also in Leicestershire. At her parents' request, she was made a ward of court in England shortly after the disappearance, which gave the court statutory powers to act on her behalf. Police described Madeleine as blonde-haired, with blue-green eyes, a small brown spot on her left calf, and a distinctive dark strip on the iris of her right eye. In 2009 the McCanns released age-progressed images of how she may have looked at age six, and in 2012 Scotland Yard commissioned one of her at age nine.\n\nMadeleine's parents are both physicians and practising Roman Catholics. Kate Marie McCann, \"née\" Healy (born 1968, Huyton, near Liverpool) attended All Saints School in Anfield, then Notre Dame High School in Everton Valley, graduating in 1992 with a degree in medicine from the University of Dundee. She moved briefly into obstetrics and gynaecology, then anaesthetics, and finally general practice.\n\nGerald Patrick McCann (born 1968 in Glasgow) attended Holyrood R.C. Secondary School before graduating from the University of Glasgow with a BSc in physiology/sports science in 1989. In 1992 he qualified in medicine and in 2002 obtained his MD, a research degree, also from Glasgow. Since 2005 he has been a consultant cardiologist at Glenfield Hospital, Leicester. The McCanns met in 1993 in Glasgow and were married in 1998. Madeleine was born in 2003 and the twins, a boy and girl, in 2005.\n\nThe McCanns were on holiday with seven friends and eight children in all, including the McCanns' three. The nine adults dined together most evenings at 20:30 in the resort's tapas restaurant, as a result of which the media dubbed the friends the Tapas Seven.\n\nThe group included Fiona and David Payne, both physicians, their two children, and Fiona's mother, Dianne Webster. The McCanns had known the Paynes for years; Kate had met Fiona in 2000 when they both worked in Leicester General Hospital's intensive care unit. Accompanying them were two couples the Paynes had originally introduced to the McCanns: Jane Tanner, a marketing manager, and her partner, Russell O'Brien, a physician, who were on holiday with their two children; and Matthew Oldfield, another physician, who was with his wife, Rachael Oldfield, a lawyer and recruitment consultant, and their daughter. Gerry, Russell and Matthew had worked together over the years.\n\nThe —Jane Tanner's report that she saw a man carry a child away from the resort 45 minutes before Madeleine was reported missing—became one of the most-discussed aspects of the case.\n\nThe McCanns arrived on Saturday, 28 April 2007, for their seven-night spring break in Praia da Luz, a village with a population of 1,000, known as \"little Britain\" because of the concentration of British homeowners and holidaymakers. They had booked through the British holiday company Mark Warner Ltd, and were placed in 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, an apartment owned by a retired teacher from Liverpool, one of several privately owned properties rented by the company.\n\n5A was a two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment in the fifth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village, which lay on the perimeter of part of Mark Warner's Ocean Club resort. Matthew and Rachel Oldfield were next door in 5B, Jane Tanner and Russell O'Brien in 5D, and the Paynes and Dianne Webster on the first floor.\n\nThe apartment block was not a gated complex. Located on the corner of Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, 5A was accessible to the public from two sides. Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club's pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A's balcony and living room. 5A's front door was on the opposite side of the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.\n\nThe McCanns' children slept in a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine slept in a single bed next to the bedroom door, on the opposite side of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was another, empty, single bed underneath the window.\n\nThursday, 3 May, was the penultimate day of the family's holiday. Over breakfast Madeleine asked: \"Why didn't you come when [her brother] and I cried last night?\" After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children's bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine's pyjama top.\n\nThe children spent the morning in the resort's Kids' Club, then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool. Kate took the last known photograph of Madeleine at 2:29 that afternoon, sitting by the pool next to her father and two-year-old sister. The children returned to Kids' Club, and at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson. The McCanns put the children to bed around 19:00. Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white Marks and Spencer's Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.\n\nAt 20:30 the parents left 5A to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club's open-air tapas restaurant, located on the other side of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160 ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295 ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the tapas restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.\n\nThe resort's staff had left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool reception area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening for the last four evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may have seen the note.\n\nThe McCanns and their friends left the restaurant roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children's bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. He pulled it nearly closed again before returning to the restaurant.\n\nThe sighting by Jane Tanner, one of the Tapas Seven, of a man carrying a child that night became an important part of the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine's father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.\n\nTanner told the police that at around 21:15 she had noticed a man carrying a young child walk across the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her. He was not far from Madeleine's bedroom, heading east, away from the front of apartment 5A. In the early days of the investigation, the direction in which he was walking was thought to be important, because he was moving toward the home of Robert Murat, the 33-year-old British-Portuguese man who lived near apartment 5A, and who became the case's first \"arguido\".\n\nThe child in the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner described the man as white, dark-haired, 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did not look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man \"(left)\", which was released in October 2007.\n\nThe sighting became important because it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction, but Scotland Yard came to view it as a red herring. In October 2013 they said that a British holidaymaker had been identified as the man Tanner had seen; he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche. Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night, and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported. The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner's report. Operation Grange's lead detective, DCI Andy Redwood, said they were \"almost certain\" the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction.\n\nThe rejection of the Tanner sighting as crucial to the timeline allowed investigators to focus on another sighting of a man carrying a child that night, this one reported by Martin and Mary Smith, on holiday from Ireland. Scotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine's kidnap.\n\nThe Smiths saw the man at around 22:00 on Rua da Escola Primária, from the McCanns' apartment, walking away from the Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was carrying a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5 ft 7 in–5 ft 9 in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on \"Crimewatch\".\n\nMadeleine's mother had intended to check on the children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns' children's bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Polícia Judiciária accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.\n\nKate made her own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was probably taken moments before this. Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio doors at the back, and noticing that the children's bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as though there was a draught, which is when she saw that the bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine's Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming \"Madeleine's gone! Someone's taken her!\"\n\nAt around 22:10 Madeleine's father sent Matthew Oldfield to ask the resort's reception desk to call the police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol. Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off. One of them told Channel 4's \"Dispatches\" that, from one end of Luz to the other, you could hear people calling her name.\n\nTwo officers from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, five miles (8 km) away. At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the criminal police, the Polícia Judiciária, in nearby Portimão. Kate McCann said they arrived just after 1 am. According to the Polícia Judiciária, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted. Two patrol dogs were brought to the resort at 2 am and four search-and-rescue dogs at 8 am. Police officers had their leave cancelled and started searching waterways, wells, caves, sewers and ruins. Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, head of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão, became the inquiry's coordinator.\n\nIt was widely acknowledged that mistakes were made during the so-called \"golden hours\" soon after the disappearance. Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours, and officers did not make house-to-house searches. According to Kate, roadblocks were first put in place at 10 the next morning. Police did not request motorway surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz that night, or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo António on the Spanish border. Euroscut, the company that monitors the road, said they were not approached for information. It took Interpol five days to issue a global missing-person alert.\n\nNot everyone in the resort at the time was interviewed; holidaymakers later contacted the British police to say no one had spoken to them. The crime scene was not secured. Police took samples from Madeleine's bedroom, which were sent to three forensic labs in Portugal. It was reported on 1 June 2007 that DNA from one \"stranger\" had been found, but around 20 people had entered apartment 5A before it was closed off, according to Chief Inspector Olegário de Sousa of the Polícia Judiciária. According to Madeleine's mother, an officer placed tape across the doorway of the children's bedroom, but left at 3 am without securing the apartment. The Polícia Judiciária case file, released in 2008, showed that 5A lay empty for a month after the disappearance, then was let out to tourists before being sealed off in August 2007 for more forensic tests.\n\nA similar situation arose outside the apartment. A crowd gathered by the front door of 5A, including next to the children's bedroom window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted the bedroom window's exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.\n\nIn the UK it was agreed that Madeleine's home force, Leicestershire police—led by Chief Constable Matt Baggott—would coordinate the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry. A strategic coordinating group, or \"gold\" group, was put together, representing Leicestershire police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and the National Police Improvement Agency. The Polícia Judiciária gave a team from the UK a room in which to work, but apparently resented their presence. The British police were used to feeding their data into HOLMES 2 (the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System). In Portugal, information was collected in boxes. In addition the Polícia Judiciária had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates' decisions, which slowed things down. In an interview for Anthony Summers' and Robbyn Swan's book \"Looking for Madeleine\" (2014), Jim Gamble, head of CEOP at the time, said the Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a \"colonial power\".\n\nA Polícia Judiciária officer acknowledged in 2010 that the Portuguese police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start, because of the \"media circus\". Gerry McCann told \"Vanity Fair\" in 2008 that he had decided to \"market\" Madeleine to keep her in the public eye. To that end, a string of public-relations people arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive. Alex Woolfall of the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, representing Mark Warner Ltd, dealt with the media for the first ten days, then the British government sent in press officers. This was apparently unprecedented.\n\nThe first was Sheree Dodd, a former \"Daily Mirror\" journalist, then Clarence Mitchell, director of media monitoring for the Central Office of Information. On 15 May the McCanns set up Madeleine's Fund, a limited company, to raise money; its website attracted 58 million hits in the first two days. The PR team arranged regular events to give the reporters a news peg. There was a visit to Fátima, where three children had reported a Marian apparition in 1917, as well as to Holland, Germany, Morocco and Spain. On 30 May, accompanied by reporters, the couple flew to Rome—in Sir Philip Green's Learjet—to meet Pope Benedict XVI. The following month balloons were let off in 300 cities around the world. From early June journalists began to voice concerns. The \"sheer professionalism of it ... troubled journalists\", according to Matthew Parris.\n\nWhen the government withdrew Mitchell, the McCanns hired Justine McGuinness, who was reportedly headhunted for the job. When she left, Hanover Communications took over briefly, headed by Charles Lewington, formerly John Major's private secretary. In September 2007 Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows stepped forward as a benefactor and offered to cover Clarence Mitchell's salary so that he could return. Mitchell resigned from his government position and started working for the McCanns full-time; he was later paid by Madeleine's Fund.\n\nPlacing Madeleine on the front page of a British newspaper would sell up to 30,000 extra copies. She appeared on the cover of \"People\" magazine on 28 May 2007, on the front page of several British tabloids every day for almost six months, and became one of Sky News's menu options: \"UK News\", \"Madeleine\", \"World News\". Between May 2007 and July 2008, the Portuguese tabloid \"Correio da Manhã\" published 384 articles about her. By June 2008 over seven million posts and 3,700 videos were returned in a search for her name on YouTube.\n\nTwelve days after the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first \"arguido\". Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother's house, \"Casa Liliana\", 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in the direction in which the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an \"arguido\" after a \"Sunday Mirror\" journalist told police he had been asking a lot of questions about the case. The Polícia Judiciária had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine's age.\n\nThree members of the Tapas Seven—Fiona Payne, Russell O'Brien and Rachael Oldfield—said they had seen Murat outside apartment 5A shortly after the disappearance, as did an Ocean Club nanny and two British holidaymakers, one a barrister and the other a businesswoman. This would not have been surprising considering how close Murat lived to 5A, but he and his mother said he had been at home all evening. The McCann circle was clearly suspicious of Murat: one of the McCanns' supporters offered Richard Bilton, a BBC reporter, \"exclusive access to any new developments in the case\" if Bilton would report back what the press pack was saying about Murat.\n\nBeginning on 15 May, Murat's home was searched, the pool drained, his cars, computers, phones and video tapes examined, his garden searched using ground radar and sniffer dogs, and two of his associates questioned. In March 2008, one of those associates had his car torched, with the word \"fala\" (\"speak\") sprayed in red on the pavement.\n\nThere was nothing to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat's \"arguido\" status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what \"The Observer\" said was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the Polícia Judiciária on behalf of Scotland Yard. In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others. In 2017 Murat's mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.\n\nIn statements to the Polícia Judiciária, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A in the days leading up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.\n\nSeveral witnesses reported men collecting for charity. On 20 April, four hundred yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking man asked a tourist in her holiday apartment for money for an orphanage in nearby Espiche. She described him as pushy and intimidating, and said he made her feel uncomfortable. Apparently there were no orphanages or similar institutions in or near Espiche at that time. On the afternoon of 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street. Polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On the day of the disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A. At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice in or near Espiche, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.\n\nAn \"ugly\" blonde-haired man was seen on 29 April on Rua do Ramelhete, and again on 2 May across the road from 5A, apparently watching it. On 30 April the granddaughter of 5A's former owners saw a blonde-haired man leaning against a wall behind the apartments, and saw him again on 2 May near the Tapas restaurant, looking at 5A. She described him as Caucasian, mid-30s, short cropped hair, \"ugly\" with spots. On the day of the disappearance or the day before, a man was seen staring at the McCanns' apartment block, where a white van was parked.\n\nIn the late afternoon of 3 May, the niece of the woman who lived directly above the McCanns was sitting on her aunt's balcony, when she saw a man leave through the gate below, as though he had come out of a ground-floor apartment. What caught her attention was that he looked around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.\n\nThe first indication that the media was turning against the McCanns was on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance. On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled \"The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence\" appeared in \"Sol\", a Portuguese weekly, stating that the McCanns were suspects, highlighting alleged inconsistencies between their statements, and implying that the Tanner sighting had been invented. The reporters had obtained the Tapas Sevens' mobile numbers and that of another witness, so it was apparent that the inquiry had a leak.\n\nThis and later articles in the Portuguese press, invariably followed up in the UK, made several allegations, based on no evidence, that would engulf the McCanns for years on social media. They included that the McCanns and Tapas Seven were \"swingers\", that the McCanns had been sedating their children, and that the group had formed a \"pact of silence\" regarding what had happened the night of the disappearance. Much was made of apparent inconsistencies within and between the McCanns' and Tapas Seven's statements. The police had asked the group questions in Portuguese, and an interpreter had translated the replies. According to Kate McCann, the statements were then typed up in Portuguese, and verbally translated back into English for the interviewees to sign.\n\nAmong the inconsistencies was whether the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the Polícia Judiciária case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the \"Sunday Times\" in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children's bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead.\n\nThe Polícia Judiciária questioned why, when Kate discovered Madeleine was missing, she had run to the tapas restaurant leaving the twins alone in 5A, when she could have used her cell phone or shouted to the group from 5A's rear balcony.\nAnother issue was whether the exterior shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box at the top of the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.\n\nThe apparent discrepancies contributed to the view of the Polícia Judiciária that there had been no abduction. Kate's shout of \"they've taken her\" was viewed with suspicion, as though she had been paving the way for an abduction story. Particularly from August onwards, these suspicions developed into the theory that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident—perhaps after being sedated to help her stay asleep—and that her parents had hidden her body for a month, before retrieving her and driving her to an unknown place in a car they had hired over three weeks after the disappearance. In 2010 Carlos Anjos, former head of the Police Detectives Union in Portugal, told BBC \"Panorama\" that most Portuguese investigators still believed Madeleine had died as a result of an accident in the apartment.\n\nOn 28 June 2007 the McCanns suggested to the Polícia Judiciária that the police request help from Danie Krugel, a South African former police officer who had developed a \"matter orientation system\", a handheld device that he claimed could locate missing people using DNA and satellites. On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his \"BS detector to go off the scale\". Kate McCann wrote in 2011 that Krugel's claims made no sense, but the couple were desperate. In the second week of June they sent him hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the family home by relatives in the UK. Krugel arrived in Praia da Luz on 15 July, and told the McCanns his equipment had picked up a \"static signal\" in an area of the beach near the Rocha Negra cliff.\n\nThe officer in charge of the Polícia Judiciária inquiry, Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, interpreted Kate's support of Krugel as a ploy. By this point he believed the McCanns were involved in the disappearance, and that Kate was using Krugel—she had also considered using psychics—to \"disclose the location of her daughter's body\" without compromising herself.\n\nWith this in mind, the Polícia Judiciária sent a letter rogatory to the British police to ask for assistance in their search for Madeleine's body. In response Mark Harrison, the national search adviser for the British National Policing Improvement Agency, arrived in Praia da Luz in July. He walked around the search areas, and flew over them by helicopter. His report, dated 23 July 2007, described Krugel's ideas as \"highly unlikely\". It said that 100 officers had searched up to 9.3 miles around Praia da Luz, but that the officer in charge and most of the team had no training in search procedures, with the exception of a search-and-rescue team from Lisbon. Search dogs had been used, but after five days instead of within two days as the handlers recommend. Harrison suggested searching the beach and shoreline, an open area near the village, Robert Murat's property, apartment 5A, the Tapas Seven's apartments, and any hired vehicles. He recommended using ground-penetrating radar and bringing in Keela and Eddie, two Springer spaniel sniffer dogs from South Yorkshire.\n\nKeela was a crime-scene-investigation (CSI) dog trained to give her handler, Martin Grime, a \"passive alert\" to the scent of human blood by placing her nose close to the spot, then freezing in that position. Eddie was a cadaver dog or enhanced-victim-recovery dog (EVRD) who gave a \"bark alert\" to the scent of human cadavers, including shortly after the death of the subject, even if the remains were buried, incinerated or in water. He was trained to bark only in response to that scent and not for any other reason.\n\nThe dogs arrived in Praia da Luz on 31 July 2007, and were taken to apartment 5A, nearby wasteland, and the beach. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room of 5A, and Eddie gave an alert near the wardrobe in the main bedroom. There were no alerts on the beach or wasteland. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, about the death of a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes. A source close to the McCanns' lawyers told reporters that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate's clothes, it could have been caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor.\n\nThe police removed the silver Renault Scenic the McCanns had hired three weeks after the disappearance, and on 6 August Keela and Eddie were taken to an underground car park opposite the Polícia Judiciária headquarters in Portimão, where 10 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns' and Robert Murat's. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns' car by the driver's door. \nThe next morning Keela alerted to the rear driver's side inside the boot (trunk) and the map compartment in the driver's door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.\n\nHair and other fibres were collected from areas in the car and apartment 5A where Keela and Eddie had given alerts, and were sent to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham for DNA profiling, arriving around 8 August 2007. At this point, according to the \"Sunday Times\", the Polícia Judiciária \"abandoned the abduction theory\". On 8 August, without waiting for the results from Birmingham, the Portuguese police called the McCanns to a meeting in Portimão, where Guilhermino Encarnação, Polícia Judiciária regional director, and Luis Neves, coordinator of the Direcção Central de Combate ao Banditismo in Lisbon, told them the case was now a murder inquiry. When Encarnação died of stomach cancer in 2010, \"The Daily Telegraph\" identified him as a major source of the leaks against the McCanns. Both the McCanns were interrogated that day; the officers suggested that Kate's memory was faulty.\n\nThe FSS used a technique known as low copy number (LCN) testing. Used when only a few cells are available, the test is controversial because it is vulnerable to contamination and misinterpretation. On 3 September John Lowe of the FSS emailed Detective Superintendent Stuart Prior of the Leicestershire police, the liaison officer between the British and Portuguese police. Lowe told Prior that a sample from the car boot contained 15 out of 19 of Madeleine's DNA components, and that the result was \"too complex for meaningful interpretation\":\n\nA complex LCN [low copy number] DNA result which appeared to have originated from at least three people was obtained from cellular material recovered from the luggage compartment section ... Within the DNA profile of Madeleine McCann there are 20 DNA components represented by 19 peaks on a chart. ... Of these 19 components 15 are present within the result from this item; there are 37 components in total. There are 37 components because there are at least 3 contributors; but there could be up to five contributors. In my opinion therefore this result is too complex for meaningful interpretation/inclusion. ... [W]e cannot answer the question: Is the match genuine, or is it a chance match.\n\nThe Forensic Science Service email was translated into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the Polícia Judiciária proposed that, if she were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given \"arguido\" status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The Polícia Judiciária told Gerry that Madeleine's DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.\n\nThe DNA evidence was a \"100 percent match\", journalists in Portugal were told. British tabloid headlines included \"Brit Lab Bombshell: Car DNA is 100% Maddie's\" (\"The Sun\", 11 September 2007) and \"Corpse in McCann Car\" (\"London Evening Standard\", 16 October 2007), while the \"Daily Star\" reported that a \"clump of Maddie's hair\" had been found in the car. Jerry Lawton, a \"Daily Star\" reporter, told the Leveson Inquiry in March 2012 that the leaks had come directly from the Portuguese police.\n\nMatt Baggott—who when Madeleine disappeared was chief constable of Leicestershire Police, the force that coordinated the British side of the case—told the inquiry that, because the Portuguese were in charge of the case, he had made a decision not to correct reporters. His force's priority, he said, was to maintain a good relationship with the Polícia Judiciária with a view to finding Madeleine.\n\nDespite their \"arguido\" status, the McCanns were allowed to leave Portugal, and on legal advice did so immediately, arriving back in England on 9 September 2007.\n\nThe following day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the Polícia Judiciária in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident, that the meal in the tapas restaurant and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate's diary and Gerry's laptop. The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.\n\nIn the UK Control Risks, a British security company—paid by an anonymous donor to assist the McCanns since 7 May—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September, at their parents' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the Polícia Judiciária files, Kate had asked them to take samples, three months after the disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found.\n\nOn 28 September, according to a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in 2010, the American ambassador to Portugal, Al Hoffman, wrote of his British counterpart, Alexander Ellis: \"Without delving into the details of the case, Ellis admitted [during a meeting on 21 September] that the British police had developed the current evidence against the McCann parents, and he stressed that authorities from both countries were working co-operatively.\"\n\nOn 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, the inquiry's coordinator, was removed from his post and transferred from Portimão to Faro after telling the newspaper \"Diário de Notícias\" that the British police had only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns, ignoring that the couple were suspects. As an example, he criticized their decision to follow up an anonymous email to Prince Charles that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine.\n\nAmaral was himself an \"arguido\" in relation to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. One day after Madeleine's disappearance, Amaral was made \"arguido\", and a month later he was charged with making a false statement. Four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11 km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother's brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.\n\nAmaral was replaced by Paulo Rebelo, deputy national director of the Polícia Judiciária. The team of detectives was expanded and a case review began. On 29 November 2007 four members of the inquiry, including Francisco Corte-Real, vice-president of Portugal's forensic crime service, were briefed at Leicestershire police headquarters by the Forensic Science Service.\n\nThe Tapas Seven were interviewed by Leicestershire police in England in April 2008, with the Polícia Judiciária in attendance. The Polícia Judiciária planned the following month to hold a reconstruction in Praia da Luz, using the McCanns and Tapas Seven rather than actors, but the Tapas Seven declined to participate. The poor relationship between the McCanns and Portuguese police was evident again that month when, on the day the couple were at the European Parliament to promote a monitoring system for missing children, transcripts of their interviews with the Polícia Judiciária were leaked to Spanish television. The national director of the Polícia Judiciária, Alípio Ribeiro, resigned not long after this, citing media pressure from the investigation; he had publicly said the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects. Portuguese prosecutors were examining several charges against the McCanns, including child abandonment, abduction, homicide and concealment of a corpse.\n\nOn 21 July 2008 the Portuguese Attorney General, Fernando José Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance. Their \"arguido\" status was lifted and the case was closed. Monteiro said in a statement:\n\nThe case involving Madeleine McCann will be shelved following the decision by the two magistrates in charge that no evidence was found to implicate the arguidos. Hereby the condition of all three arguidos ceases ... and the bail measures imposed upon the same have expired. If they appeal against the decision it can be reopened. ... The inquiry may be reopened by decision of prosecuting council or by request of any of those involved if new, serious and relevant evidence emerges.\n\nOn 4 August Portugal's Ministério Público released 17 case files containing 11,233 pages on CD-ROM to the media, including 2,550 pages of sightings. The files included a 58-page prosecutors' report, which concluded: \"No element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid, sensible, serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances.\" In 2009 Portugal released a further 2,000 pages. Days after the case closed, excerpts from Kate McCann's diary, which had been taken by the Polícia Judiciária in August 2007, were published in translation by a Portuguese tabloid, \"Correio da Manhã\", despite a Portuguese judge's ruling in June 2008 that the seizure had been a privacy violation and that any copies must be destroyed. On 14 September 2008 a News International tabloid, \"News of the World\", published the extracts, again without permission and now translated poorly back into English.\n\nThe bad feeling between the McCanns and the Polícia Judiciária reached such a height that Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, who had coordinated the investigation from May to October 2007, resigned in June 2008 to write a book alleging that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that, to cover it up, the McCanns had faked an abduction. Amaral had been removed from the case in October 2007 after telling a Portuguese newspaper that the British police were pursuing leads helpful only to the McCanns. Three days after the case closed in July 2008, his book, \"Maddie: A Verdade da Mentira\" (\"Maddie: The Truth of the Lie\"), was published in Portugal by Guerra & Paz. By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies and by 2010 had been translated into six languages. A documentary based on the book was broadcast on TVI in Portugal in April 2009, watched by 2.2 million.\n\nThe McCanns began a libel action against Amaral and his publisher in 2009. Madeleine's Fund covered the legal fees. In 2015 the McCanns were awarded over €600,000 in libel damages; Amaral's appeal against that decision succeeded in 2016. A judge had issued an injunction against further publication or sales of the book in 2009, but the Lisbon Court of Appeal overturned the ban in 2010, stating that it violated Amaral's freedom of expression. The ban was reinstated in 2015 as part of the libel ruling, then lifted when Amaral's appeal succeeded in 2016. The McCanns appealed the 2016 decision to Portugal's Supreme Court, but the court ruled against them in February 2017. In their 76-page ruling, the judges wrote that the McCanns had not, in fact, been cleared by the archiving of the criminal case in 2008. In March 2017 the Supreme Court rejected the McCanns' final appeal.\n\nThe McCanns set up Madeleine's Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007, 12 days after the disappearance. Over 80 million people visited the fund's Find Madeleine website in the three months after the disappearance. From September 2007, Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows supported the couple financially, and Kennedy's lawyer joined the fund's board of directors.\n\nAppeals were made by public figures and screened at football matches across Britain. Between May 2007 and March 2008, the Fund received £1,846,178, including £1.4 million through the bank, £390,000 online, and £64,000 from merchandise. Donations included £250,000 from the \"News of the World\", £250,000 from Sir Philip Green, $50,000 from Simon Cowell, and $25,000 from Coleen Rooney. J. K. Rowling and Richard Branson made large donations; Branson donated £100,000 to a legal fund for the McCanns. The fund did not cover the couple's legal costs arising from their status as \"arguidos\", but it was criticized in October 2007 for having made two of the McCanns' mortgage payments, before they were made \"arguidos\".\n\nA reward of £2.5 million was also offered, including from the \"News of the World\", Rowling, Branson, Green, and a Scottish businessman, Stephen Winyard. In March 2008 the Express Group paid the fund £550,000 and £375,000 in the form of libel damages arising out of articles about the McCanns and Tapas Seven respectively. In 2011 Kate McCann's book, \"Madeleine\", was serialized by \"The Sun\" and \"The Sunday Times\", both owned by News International, for a payment to the fund of ₤500,000 to ₤1 million. In December 2015 the fund stood at around ₤750,000. it had seven directors, including the McCanns.\n\nMadeleine's Fund hired several firms of private investigators, causing friction with the Portuguese police. Shortly after the disappearance, an anonymous benefactor paid for the services of a British security company, Control Risks. Brian Kennedy hired a Spanish agency, Método 3, for six months at £50,000 a month, which put 35 investigators on the case in Europe and Morocco. Kennedy went to Morocco himself in 2007 to look into one sighting.\n\nOne of the private investigators was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector, hired on the recommendation of the head of Manchester's Serious Crime Squad. Edgar released an e-fit in August 2009 of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter. Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008, and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.\n\nIn 2008 Madeleine's Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, for over £500,000 for six months. (The company owner, Kevin Halligen, was arrested in 2009 in connection with an unrelated fraud allegation.) Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal. Led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer who had worked for MI5, the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the Roma community.\n\nExton questioned the significance of the Tanner sighting of a man carrying a child at 21:15 near apartment 5A, and focused instead on the Smith sighting at 22:00—the sighting by Martin and Mary Smith of a man carrying a child near the McCanns' apartment that night. The Oakley team based on the Smiths' description. This was a sensitive issue, because in September 2007 Martin Smith had watched footage of the McCanns arriving in the UK from Portugal, and believed he recognized Gerry McCann as the man he had seen with the child in Praia da Luz. Smith came to accept that he was mistaken: at 22:00 witnesses placed Gerry McCann in the tapas restaurant. Nevertheless, publication of the Smith e-fits, which bore some resemblance to Gerry, would have fed the conspiracy theories about the McCanns.\n\nExton submitted his report to Madeleine's Fund in November 2008, but the fund told Exton that the report and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between the company and the fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. The fund passed the e-fits to the police—the Polícia Judiciária and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, \"Madeleine\" (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial.\n\nScotland Yard released the e-fits in 2013 for a BBC \"Crimewatch\" reconstruction. After it had aired, \"The Sunday Times\" published that the McCanns had had the e-fits since 2008. In response the couple sued the newspaper for having implied (wrongly) that they had not only failed to publish them but had withheld them from the police. The newspaper apologized and paid £55,000 in damages.\n\nThe McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case. Johnson commissioned a scoping report from Jim Gamble, then head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). By March 2010 the Home Office had begun discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers about setting up a British inquiry.\n\nDelivered in May 2010, the Gamble report examined how several British agencies had become involved in the search for Madeleine, including CEOP itself, Leicestershire police, the Metropolitan Police Service, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the National Police Improvement Agency, Crimestoppers, the Home Office, Foreign Office and 10 Downing Street.\n\nGamble criticized the lack of coordination. Everyone had wanted to help, and some had wanted \"to be seen to help\", he wrote, which had \"created a sense of chaos and a sense of competition\", hampering the inquiry by causing resentment among the Portuguese police. He recommended renewed cooperation between the British and Portuguese, that all relevant information be exchanged between the police forces, that police perform an analysis of telephone calls made on the night of the disappearance, and that all leads be pursued, including those developed by private detectives.\n\nIn May 2011, under Home Secretary Theresa May, Scotland Yard launched an investigative review, Operation Grange, with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians.\n\nThe announcement of the review appeared to have been triggered by a News International campaign, by way of one of its British tabloids, \"The Sun\". On 11 May 2011, as it was serializing Kate McCann's book, \"Madeleine\", \"The Sun\"s front page hosted an open letter from the McCanns in which they asked Prime Minister David Cameron to set up a new inquiry; 20,000 people signed the newspaper's petition that day. On the same day, according to her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry, Theresa May spoke by telephone, at her instigation, to Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, and Dominic Mohan, editor of \"The Sun\". The next day she wrote to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, to say that the Portuguese police had agreed to cooperate with a British inquiry. Within 24 hours, Cameron made the announcement about Operation Grange, to be financed by a Home Office contingency fund.\n\nOperation Grange was led by Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard's Homicide and Serious Crime Command was the first senior investigating officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell. The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff. When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall. By July 2013 the review had become an investigation.\n\nThe team had tens of thousands of documents translated, released an age-progressed image, and investigated over 8,000 potential sightings. By 2015 they had taken 1,338 statements, collected 1,027 exhibits, and investigated 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest. The inquiry was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four. In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved additional funding of £95,000 for what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said was one remaining line of inquiry; another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year; and £150,000 in November 2018 to cover until 31 March 2019, taking the cost of the inquiry to £11.75 million.\n\nDCI Redwood made clear that Operation Grange was looking at a \"criminal act by a stranger\", most likely a planned abduction or a burglary that Madeleine had disturbed. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which intruders had entered through windows.\n\nIn an interview in April 2017, just before the 10th anniversary of the disappearance, Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, appeared to dismiss the \"burglary gone wrong\" hypothesis, while adding that it is \"not entirely ruled out\". Referring to the suspects who might have been involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had \"pretty much closed off that group of people\". The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of remaining inquiries that they believe are significant: \"If we didn't think they were significant, we wouldn't be carrying on.\" Also that month there were claims that Scotland Yard is looking for a woman who was seen near 5A at the time of the disappearance.\n\nRedwood said in 2013 that the disappearance \"on one reading of the evidence\", did look like a pre-planned abduction: \"That undoubtedly would have involved reconnaissance.\" Several witnesses described men hanging around near apartment 5A in the days before the disappearance and on the day itself. In May 2013 Scotland Yard wanted to trace 12 manual workers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine disappeared, including six British cleaners in a white van who were offering their services to British expats. In October that year Scotland Yard and the BBC's \"Crimewatch\" staged a reconstruction—broadcast in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany—during which they released e-fits of the men seen near 5A and of the Smith sighting. Days after \"Crimewatch\" aired, Portugal's attorney general reopened the Portuguese inquiry, citing new evidence.\n\nAnother theory is that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the apartment by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell into one of the open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate at the top of the stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.\n\nUsing mobile-phone tracking techniques, police were able to trace who had used cell phones near the scene of the disappearance within the important time frame. Tracking the calls apparently required the cooperation of over 30 countries. The analysis turned up several telephone calls and texts between three men near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance: a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance.\n\nPolice also found that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club restaurant worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.\n\nScotland Yard issued another appeal in March 2014 for information about a man who had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The Polícia Judiciária reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.\n\nIn June 2014 Scotland Yard and the Polícia Judiciária, accompanied by archaeologists and sniffer dogs, searched drains and dug in 60,000 square metres of wasteland in Praia da Luz. Nothing was found. The following month, at Scotland Yard's request, the Polícia Judiciária in Faro interviewed four Portuguese citizens, with Scotland Yard in attendance. No evidence was found to implicate them. One man, an associate of Robert Murat, was first questioned shortly after the disappearance. Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the Polícia Judiciária, told the BBC in 2017 that the interviews had been conducted only because Scotland Yard requested them: \"We never saw or looked at those people as suspects of the crime.\"\n\nEleven people, including three British, were interviewed in December. According to the Portuguese media, Scotland Yard compiled 253 questions, including \"Did you kill Madeleine?\" and \"Where did you hide the body?\" Robert Murat, his wife and her ex-husband were questioned, as were a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. The bus driver and associates had telephoned or texted each other near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance. They admitted having broken into Ocean Club apartments but denied having taken Madeleine.\n\nIn the early days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from paedophile investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.\n\nA man from Northern Ireland who died in 2013 was discussed in the media in connection with the disappearance; after being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of toluene poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared. In June 2016 Operation Grange officers interviewed a victim of the deceased broadcaster Clement Freud, who was accused that year of having a history of child sexual abuse. Freud had had a home in Praia da Luz, and had befriended the McCanns in July 2007, weeks after the disappearance. His family said he was in the UK when Madeleine went missing.\n\nEilis O'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance \"could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse\". Twitter, one year old when Madeleine went missing, was the source of much of the vitriol against the McCanns. Allegations were spread by YouTube videos, tweets, Facebook posts, discussion boards, blogs and personal websites, as well as across traditional media. Ten years after the disappearance, the McCann hashtag was still producing over 100 tweets an hour, according to researchers at the University of Huddersfield. Social media's attacks included a threat to kidnap one of the McCanns' twins, and when Scotland Yard and \"Crimewatch\" staged their reconstruction in 2013, there was talk of phoning in with false information to sabotage the appeal. One man who ran an anti-McCann website received a three-month suspended sentence in 2013 after leafleting their village with his allegations, and the following year a Twitter user was found dead from a helium overdose after Sky News confronted her about her 400 anti-McCann tweets.\nThe couple's status as photogenic, articulate and professional was at first beneficial and protective. A white, middle-class family caught up in a nightmare of evil abroad offered everything the media could latch onto, writes feminist scholar Nicola Rehling, and every institution in the UK wanted to help, from 10 Downing Street down. The McCanns took full advantage of the interest by hiring public-relations consultants and offering regular events to give the media a daily news peg. But the frenzy soon turned against them, and there began what PR consultant Michael Cole called the \"monstering of the McCanns\". They were harshly criticized for having left their children alone, in an unlocked apartment, despite the availability of Ocean Club babysitters and a crèche. The argument ran that a working-class couple would have faced child-abandonment charges. Seventeen thousand people signed an online petition in June 2007 asking Leicestershire Social Services to investigate how the children came to be left unattended.\n\nKate McCann's appearance and demeanour were widely discussed, with much of the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the \"London Review of Books\". Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to cry on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid \"Correio da Manhã\" cited sources complaining that she had not \"shed a single tear\". Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that Kate had joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she did not weep in public. There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: \"How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?\"\n\nIn November 2011 the McCanns testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press standards. The inquiry heard that the editor of the \"Daily Express\", in particular, had become \"obsessed\" with the couple. \"Express\" headlines included that Madeleine had been \"killed by sleeping pills\", \"Find body or McCanns will escape\", and McCanns or a friend must be to blame, the latter based on an interview with a waiter. \"Maddie 'Sold' By Hard-Up McCanns\" ran a headline in the \"Daily Star\", part of the Express group. Lord Justice Leveson called the articles \"complete piffle\". Roy Greenslade described them as \"no journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\".\n\nIn addition to the McCanns' legal efforts against Gonçalo Amaral and his publisher, the McCanns and Tapas Seven brought libel actions against several newspapers. The \"Daily Express\", \"Daily Star\" and their sister Sunday papers, owned by Northern & Shell, published front-page apologies in 2008 and donated £550,000 to Madeleine's Fund. The Tapas Seven were awarded £375,000 against the Express group, also donated to Madeleine's Fund, along with an apology in the \"Daily Express\". The McCanns received £55,000 from \"The Sunday Times\" in 2013 when the newspaper implied that they had withheld e-fits from the police.\n\nRobert Murat received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in relation to 100 articles published by 11 newspapers—\"The Sun\" and \"News of the World\" (News International), \"Daily Express\", \"Sunday Express\" and \"Daily Star\" (Northern & Shell), \"Daily Mail\", \"London Evening Standard\" and \"Metro\" (Associated Newspapers), \"Daily Mirror\", \"Sunday Mirror\" and \"Daily Record\" (Mirror Group Newspapers). According to \"The Observer\", it was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue. His two associates were each awarded $100,000, and all three received public apologies. The British Sky Broadcasting Group, which owns Sky News, paid Murat undisclosed damages in 2008 and agreed that Sky News would host an apology on its website for 12 months.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51047851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51047851", "title": "Flüchtlingspolitik", "text": "Flüchtlingspolitik\n\nThe term Flüchtlingspolitik, refers to the legal provisions and the handling of refugees and asylum seekers wanting to enter a country, and/or subsequently staying there for a long period of time. (In this case Germany and its predecessor states)\n\nAccording to the principle of \"Cuius regio, eius religio\" (\"whose realm, his religion\"), the first type of religious refugee was established in the Holy Roman Empire at the Augsburg Settlement. These refugees were members of an \"incorrect\" denomination and therefore fled to a state which was led by a sovereign ruler who shared their beliefs. Cologne, for example, was a shelter for Catholics as well as for important church officials during the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648).\n\nThe Margraviate of Brandenburg lost half of its inhabitants during that war; the Uckermark lost even more, 90%. To balance this loss, the country became reliant on immigration. After assessing the state of the economy, craftsmen and skilled agricultural workers were hired. People who were forced to leave their home land for religious reasons were also taken in. Because of the Edict of Potsdam, Brandenburg took in Huguenots who were expelled from France. Later territories, which were ruled by relatives of the Prussian king, also took them in: e.g. from the Markgraviate of Brandenburg-Ansbach. The majority of the Lutherans from Salzburg settled in the Kingdom of Prussia in 1731-32; other Lutherans and Protestants fled from Bohemia to the newly founded colony of Nowawes (Potsdam-Babelsberg) in 1750.\n\nBefore the 1782 Edict of Tolerance, religious refugees from the Habsburg Empire moved to other Protestant areas in the Holy Roman Empire. During the French Revolution, members of the French Counter-Revolution fled to German-speaking territories. The first wave of emigration took place after the events of July and August 1789. In summer 1789 it was mainly the high nobility, especially the King's relatives, and members of the higher clergy and the military leadership, who emigrated. Due to the abolition of the feudal system and the revocation of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, there was a second wave of emigrants in the summer of 1790. Again, this consisted mainly of the nobility, the clergy and military officers. The third wave of emigration started shortly after 21 June 1791, when King Louis XIV tried to escape to Varennes.\n\nThe second main phase of emigration took place after the September massacres in 1792 and the increasing radicalization of the revolution after the King's execution in 1793. More and more members of the Third Estate were now emigrating. Among them were many former supporters of the revolution, including Girondists, who had by then broken away from the new leadership in Paris, or had been victims of political prosecution. There were smaller waves of emigration after the end of the Reign of Terror, caused by the royalist uprising on October 5 in Paris. The uprising was defeated by Napoleon and his troops and prompted the Coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797).\n\nDuring the German Empire and the Weimar Republic, Germany was one of the countries most sought after by Jews who were fleeing violence and discrimination in eastern, central and south-eastern Europe. The first big wave of Jewish refugees to Germany from the east reached was a result of the Russian Revolution and Counter Revolution in 1904-05. During the First World War which turned Poland into a war zone, there was a second big wave of Jewish immigrants from the East. Due to the Axis powers' blockade, this wave settled mainly in Central Europe, Germany and Austria. \"Hundreds of thousands of Polish Jews fled to Vienna and Berlin: children of foreign culture, speaking a foreign language, upholding foreign customs and beliefs.\" These were mostly forced to come as refugees with nothing to their name, and just tried to scrape a living in any possible way. There are no indications of any correlation between Jews from Eastern Europe and an increased crime rate. The historian Anne-Christin Saß discovered that in the second half of the 1920s in Berlin, Jews were prevented from continuing to move further west in Europe or even as far as the USA, as they had riginally intended; thus Berlin developed into a world Jewish center. This change not only intensified antisemitic resentment by the right wing supporters, but also triggered defensive reactions of fully integrated, sometimes even completely assimilated, \"Jews from the West\".\n\nAccording to a population census in 1950, around 12.5 million refugees and exiles from the eastern territories formerly occupied by the Nazi regime fled after the end of the Second World War, to the Allied occupation zones of Germany and Berlin. 3 million refugees came to Germany from Czechoslovakia, 1.4 million from Poland, roughly 300,000 from the former Free City of Gdansk (Danzig), 300,000 from Yugoslavia, 200,000 from Hungary and 130,000 from Romania. Long term residents, especially in villages, often refused to take in these refugees. In August 1952, the Equalization of Burdens Act was passed to compensate the refugees for monetary and job losses. The legal status of refugees and late resettlers is regulated by the Federal Law of Refugees and Exiles (German: short form: \"Bundesvertriebenengesetz\", BVFG; in full, \"Gesetz über die Angelegenheiten der Vertriebenen und Flüchtlinge\"; literally: Law on the affairs of the expellees and refugees) inured on June 5, 1953.\n\nThe so-called Displaced persons (DP) played a key role in the history of the German refugee policy post-1945. Most of them were deported to Germany, mainly as forced laborers, during the Second World War. Freed prisoners of war, Eastern Europeans who came to Germany voluntarily after the start of the war and people who had fled from the Soviet Army were considered within a broad definition of DPs. DPs were supposed, and also mostly wanted, to be repatriated into their country of origin. Citizens of the Soviet Union were however repatriated against their will. Polish and Baltic people, as well as the forced laborers from the areas in Belarus and Ukraine who had lived on Polish national territory before the war, had the choice either to go back to their homeland, to emigrate to another country or to stay in Germany. All over Eastern Europe, Stalinist dictatorships were established; that is why many of the Displaced Persons\", especially those who were suspected of having collaborated with the Nazi occupiers, would not leave Germany: they feared severe penalties in their country of origin. For instance, the former Latvian general Rudolfs Bangerskis, who later became a general of the Waffen-SS, died in 1958 in exile in Oldenburg. Displaced Persons are called \"homeless foreigners\" in German federal law, and their legal position, based on the \"Law on the Legal Status of Aliens in the federal territory\" of 25 April 1951, is similar to the legal position of people with refugee status.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1949, a housing estate for roughly 5000 Displaced Persons from Ukraine was built, under the initiative of the Americans,\"in the \"Ganghofersiedlung\" in Regensburg (the former \"Göring-Heim\" (lit. Göring-asylum) of the Nazis). Similar estates were also then built elsewhere in Germany. There was hardly any contact with Germans outside the camps or estates except for fairly superficial ones. In 1950, the \"Rheinische Post\" commented on the resolution of a \"Polenlager\" (Poles' camp) in Solingen which had been occupied by \"DPs\", remarking that \"the Polish economy\" would finally be over; they then remarked that \"German cleanliness would soon rule again in the spoiled area\"\"instead of the \"post-war eyesore\". Furthermore, the DPs from Ukraine were unpopular in many places because they were considered privileged in contrast to the hardships Germany was facing. In addition, some were former Nazi collaborators and formed gangs of petty criminals, controlling the black market, which was important for the supply of the population at that time.\n\nMore than 3.8 million people left the GDR, many of them illegally and at high risk, between 7 October 1949 and June 1990; from its foundation until reunification. This figure includes 480,000 citizens of the GDR who left the country legally from 1962. About 400,000 eventually returned to the GDR over time. The policy of the Federal Government maintained a marked \"welcoming culture\" towards refugees from the GDR.\n\nBased on the experiences of German emigrants, who, on the run from the Nazis, became dependent on a country that had taken them in as refugees, a new article (article 16) was added to the Federal Republic's Basic Law (\"Grundgesetz\") in 1948-49 with the following succinct text: \"Politically persecuted persons have the right of asylum.\" With this, the Federal Republic of Germany is obliged to grant a right of residence to the politically persecuted.\n\nThe second legal basis for the asylum policy of the Federal Republic of Germany is the Geneva Convention (officially called the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees) which was adopted in 1951 and came into force in 1954. This sets out globally applicable minimum standards for the treatment of refugees. The group of people are covered by this Convention are called \"Convention refugees\".\n\nOn average almost 8,600 asylum applications per year had been made between 1953 and 1979; the average number of applications climbed to more than 70,000 between 1980 and 1990. The main reason for the increase in numbers of asylum seekers was the military coup in Turkey in 1980. It led to an influx of thousands of Turks and especially Kurds fleeing to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nIn retrospect, a target of criticism was that the Federal Republic of Germany had only two mechanisms for immigration by non-Germans from countries outside the European Union, due to the recruitment of migrant workers in 1973 and the lack of an immigration law: family reunification and the assertion of the basic right to asylum. The \"bottleneck\" of asylum was very early \"pried forcefully from the outside and tightened again and again from the inside in a public defensive struggle, which created the bogeyman of the so-called 'refugee'\".\n\nDuring the Cold War hundreds of thousands of people fled from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe through the \"Iron curtain\" to the west. In particular, after the crushing of the Hungarian Uprising of 1956, the violent termination of the \"Prague Spring\" in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the Solidarity (Solidarność) movement in Poland, politically motivated asylum seeking was again a mass phenomenon. The refugees were granted asylum, most notably in the member countries of the NATO Pact, particularly in the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nParadoxically, only after the opening of the western borders of the Warsaw Pact states, migrants from these now post-communist states represented the majority of asylum seekers in Germany. In 1986 about 74.8% of the asylum seekers were still coming from the \"third world\"; but in 1993, 72.1% came from Europe, and especially from eastern, central and south-eastern Europe. At the end of 1978, the Federal Republic of Germany decided to take in South Vietnamese refugees in large numbers. This was preceded by an intensive media coverage of the plight of the so-called \"boat people\". In order to spare the 40,000 affected Vietnamese, who had been received by the Federal Republic of Germany, from the long procedure of applying for asylum, the category of \"humanitarian refugees\" was created.\n\nIn the years of Germany's division, politically persecuted figures fled from Greece, Chile, Angola, Mozambique, El Salvador and Nicaragua to the GDR. However, there they had very little contact with the German population in everyday life, as they hardly lived with them, being housed instead in special dormitories. Until 1962, the GDR took in over 200 deserters from NATO forces: primarily US soldiers.\n\nIn the 1990s, following the resolution of the east-west conflict, there were many crises and wars throughout Europe and the world. For example, there was a war in the former Yugoslavia, and a border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as between Mali and Burkina Faso. In Burundi there was a civil war, as well as in the Republic of Congo, Senegal and Zimbabwe. By 1992, the number of refugees had risen to 440,000. As a consequence, there was a wave of arson attacks on the homes of the foreigners (in Hoyerswerda, Rostock-Lichtenhagen, Mölln and Solingen). Voters became more willing to accept extreme-right political parties. As a reaction to this crisis, asylum policy in Germany was established with the introduction into the \"Grundgesetz\" of articles tackling this problem. Clause 16a was changed: a person coming from a \"safe country of origin\" or a \"safe third country\" can no longer claim political asylum on account of feeling in danger. In 1993, the law to give benefits for asylum seekers was introduced. It stated, amongst other things, that foreigners who from the start have been dependent on government aid, were to receive a lower amount than Germans and any others of equal status. The amount fell by almost 40%, to a smaller amount than the unemployment benefit (Arbeitslosengeld II LINK). In 1997 the Dublin convention was concluded, through which the German refugee policy was secured according to the European Community Law. Since then, in Germany's neighbouring countries, more specifically known as \"safe third countries\", the expected number of asylum seekers sank steadily, from roughly 320,000 in 1993 to 28,018 in 2008. It was decided that asylum seekers would only have the chance of a favourable decision if they arrive by air. As a part of the \"Asylum Compromise\", transient asylum seekers, who have landed in Germany and are still within the transit area, will be subject to accelerated asylum procedures. According to the rules, the decision on their application must be made within 2 days; the objection period is only 3 days. This means that the number of cases is kept low, which through the directive \"2001/51 / EU, airlines\", members of third countries (such as citizens of countries who are not members of the EU) allow entry into an EU country without a valid travel document, must pay a fine. This fine, since 2001, in Europe is as high as between 3,000 and 5,000 euros per passenger travelling illegally.\n\nAfter 1990, a contingent of Jewish refugees came from the former Soviet Union to Germany, hoping to achieve a more developed quality of life, where the Jewish population at the back of the national socialism regime was to be (almost) repented.\n\nIn the wake of the Yugoslavian war, by 1995, Germany had received 350,000 refugees from the warring states. This figure encompasses 48% of the total number of migrants, that left the former Yugoslavia, who went to Germany. With a few cases of hardship, most of them returned to their homeland in 2003.\n\nStarting from 2015, the unexpected entry of more than a million refugees and migrants has caused a refugee crisis in Germany.\n\nIn September 2015, the authorities found it more and more difficult to house the huge number of refugees and in particular concerned the states' registration facilities (LEA). These were shelters where the refugees were housed after they were picked up from a train station by the federal police. In order to meet the needs at least partly, the responsible regional councils of the states opened provisional shelters in many locations: demand-oriented registration facilities (BEA). The numbers of people living in the LEAs and the BEAs varied daily and they were accommodated in these registration facilities for a maximum of three months. For example, the LEA in Karlsruhe, which had a capacity of 1000, took in 3500 people.\nIt proved to be difficult to register newcomers quickly, and furthermore to quickly separate the refugees who had to be sheltered because of the Geneva Convention on Refugees, from those migrants who are not legally entitled to stay in Germany. Locating the illegal entrants as well as the fast deportation of those who did not have the right of residence also proved to be difficult. Above all, this situation led to a controversial, nationwide debate over the German refugee policy. \nOn February 17, 2016, shortly before the EU summit in Brussels on February 18–19, the Federal Chancellor said in her government declaration that she would advocate a European-Turkish solution to the refugee crisis. The goal was to \"noticeably and sustainably reduce the number of refugees, thus furthermore helping the people, who really need our protection\". This goal was to be achieved by controlling the causes of movement, protecting the external borders of the EU, particularly the border between Greece and Turkey, and arranging an organized and controlled inward flow of the refugees. The arrivals on the Austrian-German border have since then been registered and controlled. A consistent refugee identification is being gradually introduced.\n\nOn October 2015 a legislative package with essential amendments (\"Asylpaket I\") were passed into law. On 3 February 2016, the federal cabinet decided on a second legislative package with stricter regulations (\"Asylpaket II\"). This includes the introduction of particular registration facilities (BAE) for certain refugee groups, provided that their asylum requests are accepted within three weeks, including provision for possible appeal against the decision of BAMF (Federal Office for Migration and Refugees in Germany) in court. The law was due to be enacted by the German government at the end of February.\n\nFrom the outlook of 2008, the Federal Agency for Civic Education divided the history of migration and asylum policy of the European Communities, and later that of the European Union, in three phases:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "738695", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=738695", "title": "Francis Tresham", "text": "Francis Tresham\n\nFrancis Tresham ( 1567 – 23 December 1605), eldest son of \nThomas Tresham and Merial Throckmorton, was a member of the group of English provincial Catholics who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605, a conspiracy to assassinate King James I of England.\n\nTresham joined the Earl of Essex's failed rebellion against the government in 1601, for which he was imprisoned. Only his family's intervention and his father's money saved him from attainder. Despite this, he became involved in two missions to Catholic Spain to seek support for English Catholics (then heavily persecuted), and finally with the Gunpowder Plotters.\n\nAccording to his confession, Tresham joined the plot in October 1605. Its leader, Robert Catesby, asked him to provide a large sum of money and the use of Rushton Hall, but Tresham apparently provided neither, instead giving a much smaller amount of money to fellow plotter Thomas Wintour. Tresham also expressed concern that if the plot was successful, two of his brothers-in-law would be killed. An anonymous letter delivered to one of them, William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, found its way to the English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil, an event which eventually proved decisive in the conspiracy's failure.\n\nHistorians have long suspected that Tresham wrote the letter, a hypothesis that remains unproven. Catesby and Wintour shared the same suspicion and threatened to kill him, but he was able to convince them otherwise. He was arrested on 12 November and confined to the Tower of London. In his confession, he sought to allay his involvement in the plot, but never mentioned the letter. He died of natural causes on 23 December 1605.\n\nBorn in about 1567, Francis Tresham was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Tresham, of Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire, and Meriel Throckmorton, daughter of Sir Robert Throckmorton of Coughton in Warwickshire. According to the antiquary Anthony Wood, Tresham was educated in Oxford at either St John's College or Gloucester Hall or both, although biographer Mark Nicholls mentions that there appears to be no other evidence to corroborate that claim. He married Anne Tufton, daughter of Sir John Tufton of Hothfield in Kent, in 1593. The couple had three children, twins Lucy and Thomas (b.1598), and Elizabeth. Thomas died in infancy, Lucy became a nun in Brussels, and Elizabeth married Sir George Heneage of Hainton, Lincolnshire.\n\nTresham's father, born near the end of Henry VIII's reign, was regarded by the Catholic community as one of its leaders. Thomas was received into the Catholic Church in 1580, and in the same year he allowed the Jesuit Edmund Campion to stay at his house in Hoxton. For the latter, following Campion's capture in 1581, he was tried in Star Chamber. Thomas's refusal to fully comply with his interrogators was the beginning of years of fines and spells in prison. He proclaimed the accession of James I to the English throne, but the king's promises to Thomas of forestry commissions and an end to recusancy fines were not kept. His finances were seriously depleted by fines of £7,720 for recusancy, and the spending of £12,200 on the marriages of six daughters meant that when he died in 1605, his estate was £11,500 in debt.\n\nAuthor Antonia Fraser suggests that as a young man Francis became \"resentful of his father's authority and profligate with his father's money.\" Authors Peter Marshall and Geoffrey Scott describe him as possessing a \"somewhat hot-headed nature\", while another source calls him a \"wild unstayed man\". The Jesuit priest Oswald Tesimond wrote that he was \"a man of sound judgement. He knew how to look after himself, but was not much to be trusted\". While still young he assaulted a man and his pregnant daughter, claiming that their family owed his father money. Tresham spent time in prison for this offence.\n\nOn 8 February 1601 he joined the Earl of Essex in open rebellion against the government. Essex's aim was to secure his own ambitions, but the Jesuit Henry Garnet described the young men who accompanied him as being interested mostly in furthering the Catholic cause. Captured and imprisoned, Tresham appealed to Katherine Howard, but was rebuked. His sister, Lady Mounteagle, alerted his cousin John Throckmorton, who turned to \"three most honorable parsons and one especiall instrument\" for help. The identity of these individuals is unclear, but Tresham was promised freedom on the condition that over the next three months his father pay £2,100 to William Ayloffe, to \"save his lyef attainder in bloode.\" He was released on 21 June. The experience did not dissuade him from engaging in further conspiracies; in 1602 and 1603 he was involved in the missions to Catholic Spain made by Thomas Wintour, Anthony Dutton (possibly an alias of Christopher Wright) and Guy Fawkes, later dubbed by the English government as the Spanish Treason. However, upon James's accession to the throne, he told Thomas Wintour (secretary to Tresham's brother-in-law William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle), that he would \"stand wholly for the King\", and \"to have no speech with him of Spain.\"\n\nEnglish Catholics had hoped that the persecution of their faith would end when James succeeded Elizabeth I, as he appeared to hold more moderate views toward Catholics than his predecessor. But Robert Catesby, a religious zealot also imprisoned for his involvement in the Essex rebellion, had grown tired of James's supposed perfidy and planned to kill the king. He hoped to achieve this by blowing up the House of Lords with gunpowder and inciting a popular revolt to install James's daughter Princess Elizabeth as titular Queen.\n\nCatesby had recruited 11 fellow Catholics to his cause but was running out of money. Even with his debts, with an annual income of over £3,000 Tresham was one of the wealthiest people known to the plotters, and Catesby's mother was Anne Throckmorton, an aunt of Tresham's. The two cousins had been raised together and shared a close relationship.\n\nDespite their shared upbringing and involvement in the Spanish Treason, the conspirators chose not to reveal the plot to him until 14 October 1605, shortly after his father died, and just weeks before the planned explosion. According to his confession, the meeting took place at the home of Tresham's brother-in-law, Lord Stourton, in Clerkenwell. Tresham claimed to have questioned Catesby on the morality of the plot, asking if it was spiritually \"damnable\". Catesby replied that it was not, at which point Tresham highlighted the danger that all Catholics would face should the plot succeed. Catesby replied, \"The necessity of the Catholics\" was such that \"it must needs be done\". He wanted two things from Tresham: £2,000, and the use of Rushton Hall; Catesby received neither. Tresham had no money to spare, his father's debts having reduced his inheritance, although he paid a small sum to Thomas Wintour, on the understanding that the latter was to travel to the Low Countries. Following the meeting, he hurried back to Rushton Hall and closed his household, taking care to hide family papers (not discovered until 1838). He then returned to London with his mother and sisters, and on 2 November acquired a licence to travel abroad with his servants and horses.\n\nLater in October, during a meeting at which Tresham was present, the conspirators discussed the fates of several notable Catholic peers. Foremost in Tresham's thoughts were the lives of two brothers-in-law, William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, and Edward Stourton, 10th Baron Stourton, but Catesby proclaimed that \"the innocent must perish with the guilty, sooner than ruin the chances of success.\" As the last few details were being finalised that month, on Saturday 26 October Monteagle received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton. It contained the following message:\n\nUncertain of its meaning, Monteagle delivered it to the English Secretary of State, Robert Cecil.\n\nTresham has long been suspected as the letter's author. Mark Nicholls states that he almost certainly wrote it, pointing to the fact that once Catesby was made aware of its existence he immediately suspected Tresham and went with Thomas Wintour to confront him. The two threatened to \"hang him\", but \"with such oaths and emphatic assertions\" Tresham managed to convince the pair of his innocence, the next day urging them by letter to abandon the plot. Antonia Fraser suggests that Catesby and Wintour's decision to believe him should not be disregarded. While making his deathbed confession in the Tower of London, Tresham failed to mention the letter; an omission which in her opinion makes no sense if he is to be regarded as its author, especially considering that its recipient was by then being credited as the country's saviour. Author Alan Haynes views Tresham as the most likely culprit, but raises the possibility that Cecil penned the letter himself, to protect a source.\n\nAlthough he was already aware of certain stirrings even before he received the letter, Cecil did not yet know the exact nature of the plot or who was involved and had elected to watch to see what would happen. When Monteagle's letter was shown to the king on Friday 1 November, James felt that it hinted at \"some strategem of fire and powder\", perhaps an explosion exceeding in violence the one that killed his father, Lord Darnley, in 1567. The following day, members of the Privy Council visited James to inform him that a search would be made of the Houses of Parliament, \"both above and below\". Meanwhile, Tresham again urged Catesby and Wintour to abandon the scheme, but his attempts were in vain. Fellow plotter Thomas Percy said he was ready to \"abide the uttermost trial\", and subsequently on 4 November Catesby and several others left London for the Midlands to prepare for the planned uprising.\n\nFawkes was arrested while guarding the explosives shortly after midnight on 5 November 1605. Calling himself John Johnson, he was at first interrogated by members of the King's Privy Chamber, but on 6 November James ordered that \"John Johnson\" be tortured. His will finally broken, he revealed his true identity on 7 November, and on 8 November he began to name some of those with whom he was associated. Tresham's complicity was not revealed until the following day, although he was attributed with only a minor role. But while his compatriots had fled London the moment they discovered that Fawkes had been captured, Tresham had stayed in the city. He was arrested on 12 November and transferred to the Tower three days later. Catesby and several other plotters were killed on 8 November, during an armed siege at Holbeche House in Staffordshire.\n\nAlthough at first he was uncooperative, on 13 November Tresham confessed to being involved in the plot, outlining his version of events to his interrogators. Moving his family from the safety of Rushton was, he pointed out, not the action of a man who believed he was taking them into \"the very mouth and fury\" of the plot. He admitted to the government that he was guilty only of the plot's concealment, denying that he had ever been an active member of the conspiracy, although by the end of the month he had also admitted his involvement in the Spanish Treason of 1602–1603. He claimed to have persuaded Thomas Wintour and Thomas Percy to postpone the explosion, and that he had planned to inform the king's secretary Thomas Lake of a \"Puritan conspiracy\". Fraser views much of his confession as \"highly partial ... not only for his own sake but for that of his wife and children\", and important in serving to highlight his unreliability.\n\nTresham suffered from a strangury caused by an inflammation of his urinary tract, and in December 1605 his health began to decline. Lieutenant of the Tower William Waad, wondering if Tresham would live long enough for justice to take its course, described his condition as \"worse and worse\". Tresham preferred the services of a Dr Richard Foster over those of the Tower's regular doctor Matthew Gwinne; apparently Foster understood his case, indicating that it was not the first occasion on which he had treated him. During his last days he was attended by three more doctors and a nurse, along with William Vavasour, a rumoured illegitimate child of Thomas Tresham and possibly Francis's half-brother. As Tresham's wife, Anne, was apparently too upset, Vavasour wrote Tresham's deathbed confession and also an account of his last hours. Tresham apologised to the Jesuit priest Henry Garnet for implicating him in the Spanish Treason, and used the rest of his deathbed confession to protest his innocence. Anne and William read prayers at his bedside; he died at 2:00 am on 23 December. Despite not being tried, his head joined those of Catesby and Percy on display at Northampton, while his body was thrown into a hole at Tower Hill. His estates passed to his brother Lewis. Tresham's apology never reached its intended target, and his letter, along with the discovery of Garnet's \"Of Equivocation\", found among the \"heretical, treasonable and damnable books\" at Tresham's chamber in the Inner Temple, was used to great effect by Sir Edward Coke in Garnet's trial. The priest was executed in May 1606.\n\nFootnotes\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

Much of the falloff in sales was attributable to customers being unable to arrange financing. Except for Wal-Mart, which posted a slight gain, retail sales were off during October 2008 as compared with October 2007 in the United States with some moderate priced stores reporting double digit decreases. October retail sales were down 4.1% from October 2007 and down 2.8% from September 2008 with sales of cars and auto parts leading the way with a 23.4% decline from October 2007, and a 31.9% decline from September 2008.\n\nEmployment reports released by the Labor Department on Friday, November 7, showed that about 500,000 jobs were lost in the United States during September and October 2008 with unemployment rising to 6.5% at the end of October. The September figure was revised to 284,000 from the initial 159,000 reported. The initial October figure was 240,000. This is a substantial acceleration from the average 75,000 jobs lost each month since the beginning of 2008. It is anticipated by experts that unemployment will rise to 8% by the middle of 2009.\n\nIn the UK car sales fell by 23% in October, following a 21% decline in September.\n\nAmid predictions of a \"deep recession\" in the UK and the Eurozone, on Thursday, November 6, the Bank of England, citing a reduced danger of inflation due to falling commodities prices, lowered its base rate by 1.5 percentage points, from 4.5% to 3%. This was accompanied by a 50 basis point drop in the base rate to 3.25% by the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nOn November 6, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at Washington, D.C., predicted for 2009 a worldwide −0.3% decrease of the BIP for the developed economies (−0.7% for the USA and −0.8% for Germany).\n\nOn Sunday, November 9, the People's Republic of China announced a $586 billion domestic stimulus package for the remainder of 2008, 2009, and 2010. Economic growth has slowed in China with sharp drops in property and stock values. The money from the stimulus package will be spent on upgrading infrastructure, particularly roads, railways, airports and the power grids throughout the country and raise rural incomes via land reform. Also spending will be made on social welfare projects such as affordable housing and environmental protection. Some Chinese factories engaged in low-end export manufacturing have gone out of business.\n\nOn Monday, November 10, the US Treasury announced investment of 40 billion dollars in preferred stock of AIG, adjusting the terms of the existing credit line and its amount. Total exposure, including equity and debt, is now 150 billion dollars. Funds were drawn from the Troubled Asset Relief Program which was not available at the time of the original bailout of AIG. The question of whether emergency funding would be made available to the troubled American auto industry remained under consideration. General Motors is the most threatened with a sharp drop in sales and diminishing cash reserves.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 12, US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson scrapped the original Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and announced shift in the focus to consumer lending. The remaining portion of the TARP budget will be used to help relieve pressure on consumer credits such as car loans, student loans, credit cards etc.\n\nOn Thursday November 13, the Dow Jones Industrial Average marked another dramatic session, with the index (opening at 8,282.66) that after a mixed start tumbled again below the 8,000 mark (to a low of 7,965.42) but then reversed the trend and gained more than 900 points (fourth largest daily swing ever) in less than three hours closing at 8,835.25 with a net gain of more than 550 points (third largest ever).\n\nThe prospect of a federal bailout of failing US automakers appeared dim pending the inauguration of Barack Obama. There appeared to be opposition from both the Republican members of the Senate and the office of the incumbent president, George W. Bush, which expressed doubt that the companies could be salvaged.\n\nAt the invitation of US President George W. Bush the leaders of the G-20 held the initial session of the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy on Saturday, November 15, in Washington, D.C. They agreed to cooperate with respect to the global financial crisis and issued a statement regarding immediate and medium term goals and actions considered necessary to support and reform the international economy. The next session will be held April 30, probably in London, after Barack Obama takes office as President of the United States. The initial session, attended by the leaders of the G-20 set forth a road map of proposed reforms which will be followed up in coming months by the development of specific proposals, including a comprehensive reform of the Bretton Woods Institutions.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2008 the gross domestic product of Japan fell 0.4% following a 3.7% drop in the second quarter. Similar reports of recession level economic activity had been released previously by Hong Kong, Germany and the European Union.\n\nIt was widely anticipated that economic activity in the United States would be found to be at recession levels when statistics were released. As of November 20 new applications for unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 542,000 per week; new applications averaged over 500,000 a week for the last four weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 19, proposed federal bailouts of US auto makers failed with Republican senators rejecting the Democratic plan and Democratic senators rejecting the Republican plan. Negotiations continued with the Democrats requesting a plan for viability from the automakers. Automobile sales were also down sharply in Europe and bailouts were under consideration, particularly for subsidiaries of General Motors such as Opel in Germany and Vauxhall in the United Kingdom.\n\nOn Wednesday, November 19, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply by 427.47 points or 5.07%, closing below 8,000 points for the first time since March 2003. United States financial stocks led the way with Citigroup showing a 23% drop. The UK FTSE100 fell by about the same percentage, closing just above 4000. The BBC Global 30, combining Europe, Asia and North America in a single index, fell by 5.1%.\n\nOn Thursday, November 20 the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 445 points in the last minutes of the trading session, closing at 7,552, the lowest point in six years. Shares in Citigroup plummeted another 26%, and shares of other major US financial institutions dropped by more than 10%.\n\nOn Friday, November 21 the Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered about half of the loss for the week and closed above 8,000; however, stocks of Citibank, Bank of America, and J.P. Morgan Chase continued to decline. It was unclear whether the drop in the value of Citigroup stock to under $4 reflected financial weakness of the bank or what rescue plan could be crafted. One theory for the disappointment of investors was that the failure of the Treasury to purchase toxic mortgage related securities held by the bank left billions of unrealized losses on the books. Citigroup continues to hold $20 billion in mortgage-related securities, currently valued at a substantial discount.\n\nAs of the week of November 16 stock losses in United States markets during 2008 as measured by the S&P 500 were equivalent to those suffered in 1931, over 50%. Total losses during the Great Depression exceeded 80% but that was over a three-year period.\n\nLate on Sunday, November 23, a rescue plan for Citigroup was agreed by the United States government. In a joint statement by the United States Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp it was announced that in exchange for preferred stock valued at $27 billion paying 8% interest, a further $20 billion would be invested into the company and that the government would limit loss on $306 billion in risky loans and securities to 29 billion dollars plus 10% of any remaining losses. According to the joint statement, \"With these transactions, the U.S. government is taking the actions necessary to strengthen the financial system and protect U.S. taxpayers and the U.S. economy.\"\n\nFriday, November 21 and Monday, November 24 marked the Dow Jones Industrial Average's largest two-session gain since October 1987. The Dow gained 891.10 points, 11.8%, bringing it to a close at 8,443.39 points.\n\n"}
{"id": "3623103", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3623103", "title": "Halloween (2007 film)", "text": "Halloween (2007 film)\n\nHalloween is a 2007 American slasher film written, directed, and produced by Rob Zombie. The film is a remake/reimagining of the 1978 horror film of the same name; the first in the rebooted \"Halloween\" film series and the ninth installment of the \"Halloween\" franchise. The film stars Tyler Mane as the adult Michael Myers, Malcolm McDowell as Dr. Sam Loomis, Scout Taylor-Compton as Laurie Strode, and Daeg Faerch as the ten year old Michael Myers. Rob Zombie's \"reimagining\" follows the premise of John Carpenter's original, with Michael Myers stalking Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween night. Zombie's film goes deeper into the character's psyche, trying to answer the question of what drove him to kill people, whereas in Carpenter's original film Michael did not have an explicit reason for killing.\n\nWorking from Carpenter's advice to \"make [the film] his own\", Zombie chose to develop the film as both a prequel and a remake, allowing for more original content than simply re-filming the same scenes. Despite mostly negative reviews, the film, which cost $15 million to make, went on to gross $80.3 million worldwide in unadjusted U.S. dollars. Zombie followed the film with a sequel, \"Halloween II\", in 2009.\n\nOn Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois, having already exhibited signs of psychopathic tendencies, ten-year-old Michael Myers (Daeg Faerch) murders a school bully (Daryl Sabara), his older sister Judith (Hanna R. Hall), her boyfriend Steve (Adam Weisman), and his mother's boyfriend Ronnie (William Forsythe). Only his baby sister, Angel Myers, is spared. After one of the longest trials in the state's history, Michael is found guilty of first-degree murder and sent to Smith's Grove Sanitarium under the care of child psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell).\n\nMichael initially cooperates with Loomis, claiming no memory of the killings; his mother Deborah (Sheri Moon Zombie), visits him regularly. Over the following year, Michael becomes fixated on papier-mâché masks and withdraws from everyone around him, even Deborah. When Michael kills a nurse (Sybil Danning) as Deborah is leaving from one of her visits, she is unable to handle the situation and commits suicide.\n\nFor the next fifteen years, Michael (Tyler Mane) continues making masks and not speaking to anyone. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, decides to move on and closes Michael's case. Later, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove, killing multiple sanitarium employees in the process. He kills trucker Joe Grizzly (Ken Foree) for his clothes, and makes his way back to Haddonfield. On Halloween, Michael arrives at his now-abandoned childhood home, where he recovers the kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister.\n\nMeanwhile, Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris) and Lynda Van Der Klok (Kristina Klebe) prepare for Halloween. Throughout the day, Laurie witnesses Michael watching her from a distance. Later that night, Laurie goes over to babysit Tommy Doyle (Skyler Gisondo). Meanwhile, Lynda meets up with her boyfriend Bob Simms (Nick Mennell) at Michael's abandoned home. Michael appears, murders them, and then heads to the Strode home, where he murders Laurie's parents, Mason (Pat Skipper) and Cynthia (Dee Wallace). Dr. Loomis, having been alerted of Michael's escape, arrives in Haddonfield looking for Michael. After obtaining a handgun, Loomis attempts to warn Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Brad Dourif) that Michael has returned to Haddonfield. Loomis and Brackett head to the Strode home, with Brackett explaining along the way that Laurie is really Michael's baby sister, having been adopted by the Strodes following their mother's suicide.\n\nMeanwhile, Annie convinces Laurie to babysit Lindsey Wallace (Jenny Gregg Stewart) so that she can meet with her boyfriend Paul (Max Van Ville). Annie and Paul return to the Wallace home and have sex; Michael kills Paul and attacks Annie. Bringing Lindsey home, Laurie finds Annie on the floor, badly hurt but still alive, and calls the police. Michael attacks Laurie and chases her back to the Doyle home. Loomis and Brackett hear the 911 call over the radio and head toward the Wallace residence.\n\nMichael kidnaps Laurie and takes her back to their old home. He tries to show Laurie that she is his sister, presenting a picture of them with their mother and removing his mask. Unable to understand, Laurie stabs Michael before escaping the house; Michael chases her, but Loomis arrives and shoots him. Recovering, Michael recaptures Laurie before she can leave and heads back to the house. Loomis again intervenes, but Michael subdues him. Laurie takes Loomis' gun and runs upstairs, but Michael corners her on a balcony and charges her head-on, knocking both of them over the railing. Laurie awakens on top of an unconscious Michael, and shoots him in the head just as he awakens.\n\nOn June 4, 2006, Dimension announced that Rob Zombie, director of \"House of 1000 Corpses\" and \"The Devil's Rejects\", would be creating the next installment in the \"Halloween\" film series. The plan was for Zombie to hold many positions in the production; he would write, direct, produce, and serve as music supervisor. Bob Weinstein approached him about making the film. Zombie, who was a fan of the original \"Halloween\", jumped at the chance to make a \"Halloween\" film for Dimension Studios. Before Dimension went public with the news, Zombie felt obligated to inform Carpenter, out of respect, of the plans to remake his film. Carpenter's request was for Zombie to \"make it his own\". During a June 16, 2006 interview, Zombie announced that his film would combine the elements of prequel and remake with the original concept, and insisted that there would be considerable original content in the new film as opposed to mere rehashed material. The BBC reported that the new film would disregard the numerous sequels that followed \"Halloween\".\n\nZombie's intention was to reinvent Michael Myers because he felt the character, along with Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, and Pinhead, had become more familiar to audiences, and as a result, less scary. The idea behind the new film was to delve deeper into Michael's backstory and add \"new life\" to the character. Michael's mask will be given its own story, to provide an explanation as to why he wears it, instead of having the character simply steal a random mask from a hardware store, as in the original film. Zombie explained that he wanted Michael to be true to what a psychopath really is, and wanted the mask to be a way for Michael to hide. He also wanted the young Michael to have charisma, which would be projected onto the adult Michael. In addition, he decided that Michael's motives for returning to Haddonfield would be more ambiguous, explaining, \"[W]as he trying to kill Laurie, or just find her because he loves her?\"\n\nMoreover, Michael would not be able to drive in the new film, unlike his 1978 counterpart who stole Loomis' car so that he could drive back to Haddonfield. The Dr. Loomis character was also to be more intertwined with that of Michael; Zombie reasoned that the character's role in the original was \"showing up merely to say something dramatic\". Although Zombie added more history to the Michael Myers character, hence creating more original content for the film, he chose to keep the character's trademark mask and Carpenter's theme song intact for his version (despite an apparent misinterpretation in an interview suggesting the theme would be ditched). Production officially began on January 29, 2007. Shortly before production began, Zombie reported that he had seen the first production of Michael's signature mask and commented, \"It looks perfect, exactly like the original. Not since 1978 has The Shape looked so good\". Filming occurred in the same neighborhood that Carpenter used for the original \"Halloween\".\n\nOn December 19, 2006, Zombie announced to \"Bloody-Disgusting\" that Daeg Faerch would play the part of ten-year-old Michael Myers. On December 22, 2006, Malcolm McDowell was officially announced to be playing Dr. Loomis. McDowell stated that he wanted a tremendous ego in Loomis, who is out to get a new book from the ordeal. On December 24, 2006, Zombie announced that Tyler Mane, who had previously worked with Zombie on \"The Devil's Rejects\", would portray the adult Michael Myers. Mane stated that it was very difficult to act only with his eyes. Scout Taylor-Compton endured a long audition process, but as director Zombie explains, \"Scout was my first choice. There was just something about her; she had a genuine quality. She didn't seem actor-y.\" She was one of the final people to be cast for a lead role after Faerch, Mane, McDowell, Forsythe, and Harris. A contest was held for a walk-on role in the film, at the time called \"Halloween 9\"; it was won by Heather Bowen. She played a news reporter who covered Michael's arrest, but her scene was cut from the film and does not appear in the deleted scenes.\n\nApproximately four days before the theatrical release of the film, a workprint version of \"Halloween\" appeared online and was circulated around various BitTorrent sites. Upon hearing of the leaked copy, Zombie stated that whatever version had been leaked was an older version of the film, unlike what was about to be released in theaters. The leak of Zombie's workprint led to speculation that the film's box office success could be damaged, as director Eli Roth attributed the financial failure of his film, \"\", to the leaking of a workprint version. Dark Horizons webmaster Garth Franklin noted that watching the workprint allows a viewer to see what was changed after test screenings of the film in June 2007. For example, one particular scene—the rape of one of the Smith's Grove female inmates—was replaced in the final version. \"Halloween\" was officially released on August 31, 2007, to 3,472 theaters in North America, giving it the widest release of any of the previous \"Halloween films\".\n\nOn its opening day, \"Halloween\" grossed $10,896,610, and immediately surpassed the opening weekend grosses for \"Halloween II\" (1981) at $7,446,508, \"\" (1982) at $6,333,259, \"\" (1988) at $6,831,250, \"\" (1989) at $5,093,428, and \"\" (1995) at $7,308,529. From September 1–2, \"Halloween\" earned $8,554,661 and $6,911,096, respectively, for a 3-day opening weekend total of $26,362,367. The film would earn an additional $4,229,392 on Labor Day for a 4-day holiday weekend gross of $30,591,759, making it the highest ever for that holiday. As a result, the 2007 film would immediately surpass the total box office gross for \"Halloween II\" (1981) at $25,533,818, \"Halloween III\" (1982) at $14,400,000, \"Halloween 4\" (1988) at $17,768,757, \"Halloween 5\" (1989) at $11,642,254, \"The Curse of Michael Myers\" (1995) at $15,116,634, and \"\" (2002) with $30,354,442.\n\nFollowing its first Friday after its opening weekend, \"Halloween\" saw a 71.6% drop in attendance, earning $3,093,679. The film, which earned the #1 spot at the box office in its opening weekend, earned only $9,513,770 in its second weekend—a 63.9% decrease—but still claimed the #2 spot at the box office just behind \"\". The film continued to appear in the weekend top ten going into its third weekend, when it earned $4,867,522 to take sixth place. It was not until the film's fourth weekend that it fell out of the top ten and into twelfth place with $2,189,266. \"Halloween\" would fail to regain a top ten spot at the box office for the remainder of its theatrical run.\n\nThanks to its opening weekend of $30.5 million, the film broke the box-office record for the Labor Day weekend, surpassing the record set in 2005 by \"Transporter 2\" with $20.1 million. It still currently resides as the top Labor Day weekend grosser. \"Halloween\" was also the 8th highest-grossing R-rated film of 2007, and finished out the year in 44th place for domestic box office gross. With its $58 million box office gross, \"Halloween\" was the second highest-grossing film among the recent slasher remakes, taken over by \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" (2010) with $63 million. However, it is third in the list which consists of \"When a Stranger Calls\" (2006) at $47.8 million, \"Black Christmas\" (2006) at $16.3 million, \"Prom Night\" (2008) at $43.8 million, \"My Bloody Valentine 3D\" (2009) with $51.4 million, and \"Friday the 13th\" (2009) leading the group with $60 million. \"Halloween\" is also ranked eleventh overall when comparing it to all of the horror remakes, as well as eighth place for all slasher films in general, in unadjusted dollars.\n\nIn addition to the film's North American box office, it opened alongside \"Michael Clayton\" and \"Mr. Woodcock\" in foreign markets on the weekend of September 29, 2007. \"Halloween\" led the trio with a total of $1.3 million in 372 theaters – \"Michael Clayton\" and \"Mr. Woodcock\" took in $1.2 million from 295 screens and $1 million from 238 screens, respectively. By November 1, 2007, \"Halloween\" had taken in an additional $7 million in foreign markets. Ultimately, the film would earn approximately $21,981,879 overseas. By the end of the film's theatrical run, the film had taken a worldwide total of $80,253,908. When adjusting for the 2018 inflation, Zombie's \"Halloween\"—which adjusts to $77.4 million domestically—is sixth, behind Carpenter's \"Halloween\" at $183.6 million, Halloween (2018) at $155.7 million, \"\" at $107.3 million, and \"Halloween II\" at $84 million.\n\nBased on 112 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, \"Halloween\" received an average 26% overall approval rating, with the consensus \"Rob Zombie doesn't bring many new ideas to the table in \"Halloween\", making it another bloody disappointment for fans of the franchise.\" By comparison, Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a 47 out of 100 from the 18 reviews, indicating \" mixed or average reviews\". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade cinemagoers gave the film was \"B-\" on an A+ to F scale; it also reported that 62% of the audience was male, with 57% being 25 years or older.\nPeter Hartlaub, of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", felt Zombie was successful in both \"[putting] his own spin on \"Halloween\", while at the same time paying tribute to Carpenter's film\"; he thought Zombie managed to make Michael Myers almost \"sympathetic\" as a child, but that the last third of the film felt more like a montage of scenes with \"Halloween\" slipping into \"slasher-film logic\". Nathan Lee of \"The Village Voice\" disagreed in part with Harlaub, feeling that \"Halloween\" may have placed too much emphasis on providing sympathy for Michael Myers, but that it succeeded in \"[deepening] Carpenter's vision without rooting out its fear\". The film critic Matthew Turner believed the first half of the film, which featured the prequel elements of Michael as a child, were better played than the remake elements of the second half. In short, Turner stated that performances from the cast were \"superb\", with Malcolm McDowell being perfectly cast as Dr. Loomis, but that the film lacked the scare value of Carpenter’s original. Jamie Russell from the BBC agreed that the first half of the film worked better than the last half; she stated that Zombie’s expanded backstory on Michael was \"surprisingly effective\"—also agreeing that McDowell was perfectly cast as Loomis—but that Zombie failed to deliver the \"supernatural dread\" that Carpenter created for Michael in his 1978 original.\n\n\"New York Daily News\" critic Jack Matthews believed the film lacked tension, and went more for cheap shocks—focusing more on enhancing the \"imagery of violence\"—than real attempts to scare the audience; he gave the film one and a half stars out of five. Dennis Harvey, from \"Variety\" magazine, echoed Matthew's opinion that the film failed to deliver on the suspense; he also felt that you could not tell one teenage character from the next, whereas in Carpenter's original each teenager had real personalities. In contrast, Rossiter Drake of \"The Examiner\" applauded Michael's backstory, feeling that it was a \"compelling take on the mythology\" that managed to be \"unique\" and \"shocking\" at the same time. In agreement with other critics, \"Empire\" magazine's Kim Newman felt that, because Zombie seemed less focused on the teenagers being stalked and killed by Michael, the film \"[fell] flat\" when it came to delivering suspense or anything \"remotely scary\"; Newman did praise McDowell for his portrayal of the \"dogged psychiatrist\". Ben Walter, of \"Time Out London\", felt Zombie added \"surprising realism\" to the development of Michael Myers’ psychopathic actions, but agreed with Newman that the director replaced the original film’s \"suspense and playfulness\" with a convincing display of \"black-blooded brutality\".\n\nFrank Scheck, of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", believed that even though Zombie's remake of Carpenter's \"Halloween\" was better than getting another sequel in the long running franchise it still was not comparable to the 1978 original. For Scheck, Zombie replaced Carpenter's building suspense, which made it so \"brilliant\", with graphic violence and extended scenes of nudity; he also criticized McDowell for lacking the intensity that Donald Pleasence brought to the Loomis character. By contrast, \"TV Guide\"s Ken Fox felt that Zombie did deliver a \"scary horror movie\", not by copying Carpenter, but by making the film his own. Fox noted that Zombie seemed to follow more in the footsteps of Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper's \"savage, greasy-haired '70s\" films, which allowed him to bring Michael back to his roots and successfully terrify an audience which has grown accustomed to the recent \"torture porn\" horror films. Bill Gibron of \"PopMatters\" believes that audiences and critics cannot compare Carpenter's film to Zombie's remake; where Carpenter focused more on the citizens of Haddonfield—with Michael acting as a true \"boogeyman\"—Zombie focuses more on Michael himself, successfully forcing the audience to experience all of the elements that Michael went through that would result in his \"desire for death\".\n\n\"Halloween\" won the Rondo Hatton Classic Horror Award for Best Film of 2007, drawing in 550 votes, the most ever in the history of the award. The film also won the 'Best Remake Award' at the 2008 Spike TV Scream Awards. Dan Mathews, vice president of PETA, sent Rob Zombie a thank-you letter for what he perceived as Zombie sending a message to audiences when he depicted the young Michael Myers torturing animals, something he felt demonstrated that people who commit acts of cruelty to animals are likely to move on to humans. Mathews went on to say, \"Hopefully, with the attention focused by your movie on the link between cruelty to animals and human violence, more people will recognize the warning signs among people they know and deal with them more forcefully. We wish you continued success!\"\n\nCarpenter himself was ambivalent about the film; during an audience Q&A in 2016, Carpenter stated that he took issue with Zombie's comments that he was \"cold\" when they discussed the project and noted that it will color his perception of the film, and lamented that giving Myers a backstory took away from the mystique. He later clarified that he is on good terms with Zombie.\nThe film's soundtrack was released on August 21, 2007; it includes 24 tracks, consisting of 12 dialogue tracks and 12 instrumentals. The album contained both new tracks, as well as ones recycled from the original \"Halloween\" and its sequel. Tyler Bates' interpretation of John Carpenter's original \"Halloween\" theme is the first musical track, with \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper,\" which appeared in the original \"Halloween,\" and \"Mr. Sandman\", which appeared in \"Halloween II\" and \",\" performed by Nan Vernon. Writing about its selection from the 1981 film, one reviewer for the BBC commented that it worked well to \"mimic Laurie’s situation (sleeping a lot)\", making \"the once innocent sounding lyrics seem threatening in a horror film\". The album also includes Kiss's \"God of Thunder\", Rush's \"Tom Sawyer\", Alice Cooper's \"Only Women Bleed\", Peter Frampton's \"Baby, I Love Your Way\", Nazareth's \"Love Hurts\", Bachman–Turner Overdrive's \"Let It Ride\", Misfits' \"Halloween II\", and an Iggy Pop live version of The Stooges' \"1969\" among others.\n\nOn December 18, 2007, the film was released on DVD in the United States; both the theatrical (110 minutes) and an unrated director's cut (121 minutes) were released as two-disc special editions containing identical bonus features. The film was released on DVD in the UK on April 28, 2008, known as the \"Uncut\" edition. On October 7, 2008, a three-disc set was released. This Collector's Edition of \"Halloween\" features the same bonus features as the previous unrated edition, but includes Zombie's four-and-a-half-hour \"making-of\" documentary similar to the \"30 Days in Hell\" documentary for Zombie's \"The Devil's Rejects\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4918626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4918626", "title": "Ichthus Music Festival", "text": "Ichthus Music Festival\n\nThe Ichthus Music Festival was an annual Christian music festival originally held in Wilmore, Kentucky but later moved to Lexington, Kentucky. Begun in 1970, Ichthus was the oldest Christian music festival in the United States. The festival began as the brainchild of Dr. Bob Lyon and a group of seminary students at Asbury Theological Seminary in response to Woodstock Festival and similar music festivals of that era. The first events were held on the grounds of the Wilmore Campmeeting. In December 2012, the Ichthus Festival Board announced the end of the long-running festival. Creation Festivals took over managing the event in 2013 with plans to resume the festival in 2014. The festival was later postponed to 2015. In 2016, Creation Festivals announced that they would no longer hold Ichthus. The rights to the Ichthus name were acquired by Asbury University.\n\nOriginally an outdoor spring event, the festival was often hampered by poor weather. Beginning in 2006, the festival was moved to mid-June when local weather was more favorable. The festival consisted of six stages: The Main Stage, The Deep End, The Edge, two Indie Stages, and The Galleria Stage. It was a weekend long event, officially starting on Wednesday afternoon and ending on Saturday night. Most Ichthus attendees camped on the festival grounds.\n\nThe name of the festival was taken from the word Ichthus (Ichthys), an anagram in Biblical Greek used since the second century by Christians as a symbol of their religion. The word is composed of the letters \"ἸΧΘΥΣ\", meaning \"fish\". The individual letters make up a confessional statement of Christians, \"Jesus Christ Son of God, Savior\":\n\nEvery day of the Ichthus festival a worship service was held at the main stage amphitheater. These services consisted of a worship session with music followed by a keynote speaker. A tent near the back of the worship area was staffed by altar ministers who were available to pray with people after the services.\n\nOn the last day of the festival (Saturday) all stages, merchandise tents, and food vendors closed in the afternoon for a massive communion service. Around 20,000 people gathered at the main stage amphitheater for the massive communion service. This service consisted of praise and worship music followed by a keynote speaker and communion.\n\nIn recent years Ichthus was held at the Ichthus Farm , which has features such as shower houses, a playground, basketball courts, soccer fields, a pavilion, and a permanent main stage with a maximum capacity of approximately 25,000 people.\n\nIchthus Ministries has held satellite festivals in addition to the main Ichthus festival. One was a one-day, four-stage festival in Fort Wayne, Indiana which was held on September 25, 2010. Ichthus Fort Wayne featured top names such as Jars of Clay, Switchfoot, Relient K, Red, Thousand Foot Krutch, BarlowGirl, The Almost, KJ-52, Disciple, Family Force 5, and Sanctus Real. Ichthus Ministries held another festival in Pikeville, Kentucky on October 23, 2010.\n\nThe Ichthus Main Stage had a reputation for being loaded with top name artists from all genres. From the worship of Casting Crowns to the heavier sound of Skillet. The stage has a legendary history due to its past artists and it's amazing special effects. The artists which have played include Skillet, Casting Crowns, Switchfoot, Tobymac, Newsboys, Phil Keaggy, Red, and David Crowder Band. The stage was also known for the large communion service that was held each year at the festival.\n\nThe Ichthus Deep End Stage was dedicated primarily to Christian metal, heavy metal, and punk rock bands. Deep End was the first secondary stage added to the festival and it grew to include its ministry tent and sales area. Though it was a secondary stage, it featured some well known names in Christian music, and up and coming acts such as Twenty One Pilots, The Devil Wears Prada, Anberlin, Pillar, Haste the Day, Day of Fire, Sleeping Giant, and Disciple.\n\nThe Deep End stage area included tents for band merchandise sales and Christian gothic ministries, such as Hope for the Rejected and Grave Robber.\n\nThe Edge at Ichthus Festival was an area dedicated to mostly punk rock, metal, Hip-Hop and Indie music. It featured The Edge Stage, a skate park, and a merchandise area. The skate park features a mini ramp, quarter pipe, manual box, launch ramp, and a rail. Though the Edge Stage was a secondary stage, it also featured some big name acts such as The Showdown, Day of Fire and Creating Constellations.\n\nThe Galleria Stage was located at the food court and was dedicated primarily to acoustic music. The stage area includes tables and chairs and a coffee shop. Artists that have played this stage include Phil Keaggy, and Glenn Kaiser Band.\n\n"}

{"id": "681244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=681244", "title": "LinuxTag", "text": "LinuxTag\n\nLinuxTag (the name is a compound with the German \"Tag\" meaning assembly, conference or meeting) is a free software exposition with an emphasis on Linux (but also BSD), held annually in Germany. LinuxTag claims to be Europe's largest exhibition for \"open source software\" and aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Linux and free software market, and to promote contacts between users and developers. LinuxTag is one of the world's most important events of this kind.\n\nLinuxTag's slogan, \"Where .COM meets .ORG\", refers to its stated aim of bringing together commercial and non-commercial groups in the IT sector. Each year's event also has its own subtitle.\n\nLinuxTag sees itself as part of the free software movement, and promotes this community in an extraordinary degree by supporting numerous open source projects. LinuxTag offers a way for these projects to promote their software and their concepts, and thus present themselves to the public in an appropriate manner, with their own stands, forums and lectures. The goal is to encourage projects to share concepts and content to the benefit of other groups and companies, and to provide forums for in-depth discussions of new technologies and opportunities.\n\nThe non-profit association \"LinuxTag e.V.\" was founded in preparation for LinuxTag's move from Kaiserslautern to the University of Stuttgart in 2000. The association plans and organizes the LinuxTag event by volunteer work and guides its ideological development. The association LinuxTag e.V. is registered in Association Register VR 2239 of the Kaiserslautern District Court. The association manages the \"LinuxTag\" name and word mark. The purpose of the association, according to its bylaws, is \"the promotion of Free Software\", and is pursued through the organization of the LinuxTag events.\n\nThe association is represented by a three-person executive board, supplemented by several representatives with delegated authority. All members of the LinuxTag association are volunteers and receive no remuneration for their service. (In 2005, the First Chairman and CFO were employed and remunerated by the association from 1 April until 31 July.) Surpluses resulting from the LinuxTag events or from sponsorship are reinvested in the association's non-profit activities.\n\nLinuxTag was launched in 1996 by a handful of active members of the Unix Working Group (Unix-AG) at the University of Kaiserslautern. They wanted to inform the public about the young technology of Linux and Open Source software. The first LinuxTag event only drew a small number of participants. Since then, however, the event has changed venues several times to keep pace with rapidly growing numbers of exhibitors and visitors.\n\nThe first LinuxTag conference and exhibition was held at the University of Technology in Kaiserslautern.\n\nThe first LinuxTag was a theme night on Linux. In 1998, LinuxTag drew 3,000 visitors. In 1999 the event was nationally announced, and drew some 7,000 visitors. It was the first time LinuxTag filled a whole building, and the last time it was held in Kaiserslautern. In the aftermath of the event, the LinuxTag association was founded.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001 LinuxTag was held in Stuttgart.\n\nLinuxTag 2000 was held at the Stuttgart exhibition center from 29 June to 2 July, and received up to 17,000 visitors. The conference included a business track for the first time, devoted to such topics as IT security, legal aspects of free software, and potential uses of Linux and the open-source concept in commercial applications. IT decision-makers were shown case studies in applications of free software.\n\nLinuxTag 2001 took place at Stuttgart exhibition center from 5 to 8 July, with 14,870 visitors. The event was held under the patronage of the German Ministry of the Economy. Keynote speakers were Eric S. Raymond, Rob \"Cmdr Taco\" Malda from Slashdot and John \"Maddog\" Hall of Linux International.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2005, the LinuxTag conference and exhibition was held in Karlsruhe.\n\nLinuxTag was held in 2002 for the first time from 06.06.2002 to 09.02.2002 in the Karlsruhe Convention Centre. There were about 13,000 visitors. The motto of the conference was \"Open your mind, open your heart, open your source!\". About 100 exhibitors were at the exhibition.\n\nLinuxTag 2003 was titled\" Open Horizons\" and was held from 10 to 13 July for the second time in Karlsruhe in 2003.\n\nAs an exhibitor, both businesses and non-profit groups were represented. Apple showed Mac OS X in conjunction with open source. Around 150 exhibitors were there in 2003. Other highlights included the release of OpenGroupware.org on the model of OpenOffice.org as an open source and free conversion of several dozen Xbox s, some with hardware modification by two solder points, partially by importing the so-called MechInstallers on Linux.\n\nThere was also a Programming Competition, and on Sunday a world record attempt took 13 to 14 clock instead: On a server 100 Linux desktop sessions should with Gnome and KDE are simultaneously running. Here, everyone could join in on the Internet. The result was not disclosed.\n\nBesides the exhibition also congresses were held in which renowned experts spoke on a subject group. There was, for example, a Debian conference and on Sunday there was a lecture on TCPA, followed by discussion. The Business and Administration Congress has enlarged with 400 participants by about 60%. The free lecture program was opened on Friday by the Parliamentary State Secretary, Federal Ministry of Economics and Labour (BMWA), Rezzo Schlauch. Keanote speaker were Jon \"Maddog\" Hall of Linux International, Georg Greve of Free Software Foundation Europe and Matthias Kalle Dalheimer of Klarälvdalens Datakonsult AB.\n\nWith Webcams you could also take a virtual visit to the fair. The Pingu-Cam (Tux of Penguin is the Linux mascot) showed pictures from the zoo of Karlsruhe, which is located right next to the fairgrounds.\n\nLinuxTag 2004 took place from 23 to 26 June for the third time in the congress center in Karlsruhe in 2004. Those who filed on the homepage, got in free. For 10 euro entry but you got a Tuxpin, a Knoppix DVD and a DVD with FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD.\n\nLinuxTag 2004 had the slogan\" \"Free source - free world\"\". 16,175 visitors were counted. \nWith the record number of about 170 exhibitors, among many freelance projects also numerous large and medium-sized enterprises were there. Hewlett-Packard was the third time\" Official Cornerstone Partner\". Other major companies were the C & L Verlag, Intel, Novell, Oracle, SAP and Sun Microsystems. For the first time Microsoft was represented with a booth.\n\nThe one-day Business and Administration Congress on 24 June were presented in business and government case studies and success stories about the use of open source software. Among other things, also the problem with Virus and worms was an issue.\n\nFor the free conference, there was a record turnout with about 350 proposals from 20 countries. 130 thereof could be accommodated in the program. The issue of software patent was an important issue. For the first time the LPI 101 certification was possible at the LinuxTag. Contests on this LinuxTag were a coding marathon and Hacking Contest.\n\nLinuxTag 2005 took place in the period from 22 to 25 June held in the Congress Center Karlsruhe. LinuxTag 2005 was the 11th LinuxTag and titled \"Linux everywhere\". In addition to the exhibition of different companies that have to do with Linux, more or less, there was once again in 2005, a presentation program. Also, the Business and Administration Congress took place on 22 June 2005 again. During the LinuxTag was the possibility to participate at various tutorials.\n\nJimmy Wales announced in his opening speech, the collaboration between Wikipedia and KDE. Through a web interface each program can directly access Wikipedia. The KDE Media Player Amarok can access the Wikipedia article of artists starting with version 1.3.\n\nThe organizer spoke of 12,000 visitors, which was mainly caused by the newly designed entrance fees and the hottest week of the year.\n\n2006 was the LinuxTag in Wiesbaden.\n\nLinuxTag 2006 took place from 3 to 6 May 2006 in the Rhein-Main-Hallen in Wiesbaden under the theme „See, what's ahead“\n. According to organizers, over 9,000 people from over 30 nations attanded LinuxTag 2006. There were many, often international lectures and various information booths, present among others were IBM, Avira and Sun Microsystems, but some others such as Hewlett-Packard or Red Hat were missing. Three teams participated the \" hacking\" Contest.\n\nThe most visited lecture of the year was the Keynote of Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth., The \"chief dreamer of Ubuntu\" referred to himself and the good cooperation of users with developers. He stressed that Kubuntu and Ubuntu should be treated equally and that there is a good cooperation between the developers. There was also the opportunity to pursue some of the lectures on a video stream, which was used by an estimated 1,800 people.\n\nSince 2007, the LinuxTag in Berlin in the Exhibition halls held under the Berlin Radio Tower.\n\nLinuxTag 2007 took place from 30 May to 2 June 2007 with the slogan \"Come in: We're open\" instead. It was attended by about 9600 people.\n\nThe event was held under the auspices of Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble.\n\nLinuxTag 2008 took place from 28 to 31 May at the Berlin Exhibition Grounds with 11,612 visitors. The second LinuxTag in the German capital was under the patronage of German Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor Frank-Walter Steinmeier and is part of a six-day \"IT Week in the Capital Region\", which includes the fourth time in Berlin held IT business trade fair \"IT Profits\" under the patronage of the Federal Minister of Transport. At the same time the second German Asterisk day, the user and developer conference to Voice over IP, and the 8th @ Kit Congress to discuss legal issues of professional IT use. Important topics were \"Highlights of digital lifestyle\" and the \"Mobile + Embedded Area\".\nLinuxTag 2009 took place from 24 to 27 June on the Berlin Exhibition Grounds. He had more than 10,000 visitors. He is under the patronage of German Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor Frank-Walter Steinmeier. The new president of Free Software Foundation Europe Karsten Gerloff attended LinuxTag. A focal point is the \"image of business processes using Linux\" and \"Open Source in the colors of the tricolor,\" for which 14 open source suppliers from France showing their product and service range.\n\nLinuxTag 2010 was the 16th LinuxTag and took place from 9 to 12 June 2010 at the Berlin Exhibition Grounds. It was attended by about 11,600 people. He is under the patronage of Cornelia Rogall-Grothe, Federal Government Commissioner for Information Technology. Keynote speakers included Microsoft's general manager James Utzschneider who stunned the audience with his open approach to open source, the CEO of SugarCRM, Larry Augustin underlined the economic impact of OSS and the connection with the upcoming trend cloud computing, the open source Chef Google, Chris DiBona, underlined the high professional level of the Congress, the kernel developer Jonathan Corbet gave an outlook on the next Linux kernel 2.6.35 and Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth staked out the milestones for Ubuntu desktops.\n\nThe 17th LinuxTag was held from 11 to 14 May 2011 on the Berlin Exhibition Grounds with the slogan \"Where .com meets .org\". It was attended by 11,578 visitors and was under the patronage of Cornelia Rogall-Grothe of the Federal Government Commissioner for Information Technology. Keynotes were given by Wim Coekaerts (Oracle), Bradley Kuhn (Software Freedom Conservancy) and Daniel Walsh (Red Hat).\n\nThe 18th LinuxTag was held from 23 to 26 May 2012 on the Berlin Exhibition Grounds with the motto \"Open minds create effective solutions\". He is under the patronage of Cornelia Rogall-Grothe of the Federal Government Commissioner for Information Technology. At LinuxTag the premiere of \"Open MindManager Morning\" took place, discussed on the industry experts and educators across the IT and changes in society, and philosophizing.\n\nIn addition, also found the premiere of the new lecture series \"Open Minds Economy\", organized by the Open Source Business Alliance and Messe Berlin, instead, presents the successful model of open source software in the fields of economy and society.\n\nKeynotes were given by Jimmy Schulz, chairman of the project group \"Interoperability, standards and open source\" the Commission of Inquiry to Internet and digital society in the German Bundestag, Ulrich Drepper, maintainer of the GNU C standard library Glibc and Lars Knoll, employees at Nokia and Chief maintainer of the QT library.\n\nThe 19 LinuxTag was held from 22 to 25 May 2013 embedded on the Berlin Exhibition Grounds with the motto \"In the cloud - triumph of the free software goes on\".\n\nIt was held the premiere of \"Open IT Summit\", which was organized as a parallel conference on LinuxTag of the Open Source Business Alliance (OSBA) and Messe Berlin with the goal to discuss the topic open source in the business environment. Also the OpenStack Day took place in cooperation with the OpenStack Foundation as a first major subconference on the subject OpenStack in Europe. The Foundation has its headquarters in the U.S. and sees itself as a global reservoir of the same name, scalable cloud management platform.\n\nKeynotes were given by kernel developer Matthew Garrett on the subject of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) and Secure Boot and Benjamin Mako Hill, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who called so-called anti Features unacceptable, where manufacturers to build restrictions into devices.\n\nIn recent years, the number of visitors of LinuxTag stagnated despite more and more users of open-source programs. This decline in visitor numbers was interpreted as a side effect of the high market penetration of free software and Linux. In addition, for some years, there were many similar regional events, which have drawn from the concept of LinuxTag.\n\nIn order to adapt to the changes, the Linuxtag focused on the core issue of the professional use of open source software in 2014. Therefore, LinuxTag started a strategic partnership with the droidcon.\n\nThe 20th LinuxTag took place between 8 and 10 May 2014 in the STATION Berlin.\nIn spatial and temporal proximity were the Media Convention Berlin (May 6 to 7), the re: publica (6 to 8 May) and the droidcon (8 to 10 May 2014). All events aimed towards a close relationship in order to achieve a high level of appreciation of the combined effort.\n\n"}

{"id": "638448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=638448", "title": "Mothers Against Drunk Driving", "text": "Mothers Against Drunk Driving\n\nMothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) is a nonprofit organization in the United States and Canada that seeks to stop drunk driving, support those affected by drunk driving, prevent underage drinking, and strive for stricter impaired driving policy, whether that impairment is caused by alcohol or any other drug. The Irving, Texas–based organization was founded on September 5, 1980, in California by Candace Lightner after her 13-year-old daughter, Cari, was killed by a drunk driver. There is at least one MADD office in every state of the United States and at least one in each province of Canada. These offices offer victim services and many resources involving alcohol safety. MADD has claimed that drunk driving has been reduced by half since its founding.\n\nAccording to MADD's website, \"The mission of Mothers Against Drunk Driving is to end drunk driving, help fight drugged driving, support the victims of these violent crimes and prevent underage drinking.\" Generally MADD favors strict policy in a variety of areas, including an illegal blood alcohol content of .08% or lower and using stronger sanctions for DUI offenders, including mandatory jail sentences, treatment for alcoholism and other alcohol abuse issues, ignition interlock devices, and license suspensions; maintaining the minimum legal drinking age at 21 years; mandating alcohol breath-testing ignition interlock devices (IIDs) for everyone convicted of driving while legally impaired.\n\nMADD's founder, Candace Lightner left the group in 1985. In 2002, as reported by The Washington Times, Lightner stated that MADD \"has become far more neo-prohibitionist than I had ever wanted or envisioned … I didn't start MADD to deal with alcohol. I started MADD to deal with the issue of drunk driving\".\n\nAuthor Susan Cheever and the SAGE \"Encyclopedia of Social Problems\" have said MADD is a manifestation of the temperance movement. MADD \"supports a substantial increase in taxation on alcoholic beverages as a means of covering the cost to society caused by misuse of alcohol\". MADD \"advocates that schools and other organizations hosting social and athletic gatherings for youth take positive steps to ensure that alcoholic beverages not be present at those gatherings\".\n\nOn May 3, 1980, Cari Lightner, a 13-year-old girl, was killed by a drunken hit-and-run driver at Sunset and New York Avenues in Fair Oaks, California. The 46-year-old driver, who had recently been arrested for another DUI hit-and-run, left Cari's body at the scene. Cari's mother, Candace (Candy) Lightner, organized Mothers Against Drunk Driving and subsequently served as its founding president. A 1983 television movie about Lightner garnered publicity for the group, which grew rapidly.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the group attracted the attention of the United States Congress. Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) did not like the fact that youth in New Jersey could easily travel to New York to purchase alcoholic beverages, circumventing New Jersey's law restricting consumption to those 21 years old and older.\n\nThe group had its greatest success with the enacting of a 1984 federal law, the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, that introduced a federal penalty (a 5%—later raised to 10%—loss of federal highway dollars), for states that didn't raise the minimum legal age for the purchase and possession of alcohol to 21. After the United States Supreme Court upheld the law in the 1987 case of \"South Dakota v. Dole\", every state and the District of Columbia made the necessary adjustments by 1988 (but not the territories of Puerto Rico and Guam). However, in July 2010 Guam raised its drinking age to 21.\n\nIn 1985, Lightner objected to the shifting focus of MADD, and left her position with the organization.\n\nIn 1988, a drunk driver traveling the wrong way on Interstate 71 in Kentucky caused a head-on collision with a school bus. Twenty-seven people died and dozens more were injured in the ensuing fire. Known as the Carrollton bus disaster, it equaled another bus crash in Kentucky in 1958 as the deadliest bus crash in US history. In the aftermath, several parents of the victims became actively involved in MADD and one became its national president.\n\nIn 1989, MADD Canada was founded.\n\nIn 1994, \"The Chronicle of Philanthropy\" released the results of the largest study of charitable and non-profit organization popularity and credibility. The study showed that MADD was ranked as the \"most popular charity/non-profit in America of over 100 charities researched with 51% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing \"Love\" and \"Like A Lot\" for MADD.\n\nMADD released its first \"Rating the States\" report, grading the states in their progress against drunk driving, in 1991. \"Rating the States\" has been released four times since then.\n\nIn 1999, MADD's National Board of Directors unanimously voted to change the organization's mission statement to include the prevention of underage drinking.\n\nIn 2002, MADD announced its \"Eight-Point Plan\". This consisted of:\n\nIn a November 2006 press release, MADD launched its 'Campaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving': this is a four-point plan to completely eliminate drunk driving in the United States using a combination of current technology (such as alcohol ignition interlock devices), new technology in smart cars, law enforcement, and grass roots activism.\n\nMADD's national president was Millie I. Webb in 2002. Chuck Hurley became MADD CEO in 2005. He retired in June 2010 and was replaced by Kimberly Earle, who had been CEO of Susan G. Komen for the Cure since 2007. Earle left to become the president of a new foundation of Sanford Health in January 2012, the Edith Sanford Breast Cancer Foundation. Debbie Weir replaced her as MADD's CEO.\n\nAccording to Obama-Coburn Federal Funding Accountability Transparency Act of 2006, MADD received $56,814 in funds from the federal government in fiscal year 2000, and a total of $9,593,455 between fiscal years 2001 and 2006.\n\nIn 1994, \"Money\" magazine reported that telemarketers raised over $38 million for MADD, keeping nearly half of it in fees. This relationship continues to date.\n\nIn 2001, \"Worth\" magazine listed MADD as one of its \"100 best charities\".\n\nIn 2005, \"USA Today\" reported that the American Institute of Philanthropy was reducing MADD from a \"C\" to a \"D\" in its ratings.\nThe Institute noted that MADD categorizes much of its fundraising expenses as \"educational expenses\", and that up to 58% of its revenue was expended on what the Institute considered fund-raising and management.\n\nCharity Navigator rated MADD at 63.53 out of 100 on its financial rating scale and 96.00 out of 100 on its accountability and transparency scale for its 2013 fiscal year. MADD reported that it spent 24.4% of its total expenses on fundraising that year.\n\nIn 2014 MADD spend over $9 million on fundraising activities according to its 2014 tax return.\n\nRadley Balko, an advocate for decriminalizing drunk driving, argued in a December 2002 article that MADD's policies are becoming overbearing. \"In fairness, MADD deserves credit for raising awareness of the dangers of driving while intoxicated. It was almost certainly MADD's dogged efforts to spark public debate that effected the drop in fatalities since 1980, when Candy Lightner founded the group after her daughter was killed by a drunk driver,\" Balko wrote. \"But MADD is at heart a bureaucracy, a big one. It boasts an annual budget of $45 million, $12 million of which pays for salaries, pensions and benefits. Bureaucracies don't change easily, even when the problems they were created to address change.\" Charity Watch gives MADD a \"C-\" grade.\n\nMADD was heavily involved in lobbying to reduce the legal limit for blood alcohol from BAC .10 to BAC .08. \nIn 2000, this standard was passed by Congress and by 2004, every state had a legal .08 BAC limit.\nMADD Canada has called for a maximum legal BAC of .05. Although many MADD leaders have supported a lower limit, MADD has not called for a legal limit of .05 in the United States.\n\nMADD promotes the use of victim impact panels (VIPs), in which judges require DWI offenders to hear victims or relatives of victims of drunk driving crashes relate their experiences. MADD received $5,547,693 in 2010 from VIPs; much of this income was voluntary donations by those attending as some states do not allow a fee to be charged to offenders for non-legislative programs. Other states like California and Georgia require that a fee be paid in order to attend. In California this fee ranges from $25 to $50 depending on the county and in Georgia this fee is $50. Some states in the United States, such as Massachusetts, permit victims of all crimes, including drunk driving accidents, to give victim impact statements prior to sentencing so that judges and prosecutors can consider the impact on victims in deciding on an appropriate sentence to recommend or impose. The presentations are often emotional, detailed, and graphic, and focus on the tragic negative consequences of DWI and alcohol-related crashes. According to the John Howard Society, some studies have shown that permitting victims to make statements and to give testimony is psychologically beneficial to them and aids in their recovery and in their satisfaction with the criminal justice system. A New Mexico study suggested that the VIPs tended to be perceived as confrontational by multiple offenders. Such offenders then had a higher incidence of future offenses.\n\nOn April 29, 2008 MADD issued a press release criticizing the video game \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" saying it was \"extremely disappointed\" with the manufacturers. MADD has called on the ESRB to re-rate the game to Adults Only. They also called on the manufacturer (Rockstar) \"to consider a stop in distribution – if not out of responsibility to society then out of respect for the millions of victims/survivors of drunk driving.\". Players can drive drunk in \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" but doing so makes it harder to drive. The game also explicitly recommends that the player take a taxi instead of driving, and the character makes humorous remarks suggesting that it is bad to drive drunk. Ignoring these will lead to consequences: if any police officer is around while the player is drunk driving, the player immediately becomes wanted by the police.\n\nPrior to the MADD's influence, drunk driving laws addressed the danger by making it a criminal offense to drive a vehicle while impaired — that is, while \"under the influence of alcohol\"; the amount of alcohol in the body was evidence of that impairment. The level specified at that time — commonly, 0.15% — was high enough to indicate drunkenness rather than impairment. In part due to MADD's influence, all 50 states have now passed laws making it a criminal offense to drive with a designated level of alcohol of .08% or higher.\n\nMADD writes that \"opponents of sobriety checkpoints tend to be those who drink and drive frequently and are concerned about being caught\".\n\nRadley Balko, opponent of limits on drunk driving and writer for \"Reason Magazine\", discusses the possible social implications of some of MADD's policies in a 2002 article. He writes, \"In its eight-point plan to 'jump-start the stalled war on drunk driving,' MADD advocates the use of highly publicized but random roadblocks to find drivers who have been drinking.\".\n\nBalko criticizes MADD for not advocating higher excise taxes on distilled spirits, even though it campaigns for higher excise taxes for beer. He writes, \"Interestingly, MADD refrains from calling for an added tax on distilled spirits, an industry that the organization has partnered with on various drunk driving awareness projects.\" MADD writes, \"Currently, the federal excise tax is $.05 per can of beer, $.04 for a glass of wine and $.12 for a shot of distilled spirits, which all contain about the same amount of alcohol.\" Point 7 of MADD's 8-Point Plan is to \"Increase beer excise taxes to equal the current excise tax on distilled spirits\".\n\nAdditionally, MADD has proposed that breath alcohol ignition interlock devices should be installed in all new cars.\nTom Incantalupo wrote:\n\"Ultimately, the group said yesterday, it wants so-called alcohol interlock devices factory-installed in all new cars. \"The main reason why people continue to drive drunk today is because they can,\" MADD president Glynn Birch said at a news teleconference from Washington, D.C.\"\n\nSarah Longwell, a spokeswoman for the restaurant lobbying group American Beverage Institute, responded to MADD's proposals for ignition interlocks by stating \"This interlock campaign is not about eliminating drunk driving, it is about eliminating all moderate drinking prior to driving. The 40 million Americans who drink and drive responsibly should be outraged.\" She also points out that \"Many states have laws that set the presumptive level of intoxication at .05% and you can't adjust your interlock depending on which state you're driving in. Moreover, once you factor in liability issues and sharing vehicles with underage drivers you have pushed the preset limit down to about .02%. It will be a \"de facto\" zero tolerance policy.\"\n\nA review of devices concluded, \"The results of the study show that interlock works for some offenders in some contexts, but not for all offenders in all situations. More specifically, ignition interlock devices work best when they are installed, although there is also some evidence that judicial orders to install an interlock are effective for repeat DUI offenders, even when not all offenders comply and install a device. California's administrative program, where repeat DUI offenders install an interlock device in order to obtain restricted driving privileges, is also associated with reductions in subsequent DUI incidents. One group for whom ignition interlock orders do not appear effective is first DUI offenders with high blood alcohol levels.\".\n\n"}

It was one of a number of events to take place on the day, including rallies in Edinburgh and Birmingham. Pro-Brexit demonstrators staged a counter-protest at one location along the marching route.\n\nThe Unite for Europe march, which coincided with the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, was held in London on 25 March 2017, and the \"Independent\" reported that police estimated 100,000 people attended.\n\nThe People's March Ltd came into being in the summer of 2017, to help ensure that a march planned for 9 September 2017 in London went ahead. The event began with a march and was followed by speeches in Parliament Square. The event was attended by thousands of people and was part of a series of protests dubbed \"the Autumn of discontent\". Over 50,000 people took to the streets under the banner \"Unite, Rethink, Reject Brexit\" marching from Hyde Park to Parliament Square followed by a rally with speakers from the remain movement and from across the political spectrum and received broad media coverage.\n\nThe StopBrexit Manchester march was held in All Saints Park, Manchester, on 1 October 2017, to coincide with the Conservative Party conference. The event consisted of a rally followed by a march through central Manchester, and finishing with a street party organised by local pro-EU groups. An estimated 30,000 people took part in this event.\n\nThe StopBrexit Leeds march was held on 24 March 2018 in Leeds. The march assembled at The Headrow in central Leeds and ended with a rally at The Headrow, with thousands of people reported to have attended. Leeds for Europe organised the march.\n\nOn 23 June 2018, the second anniversary of the EU referendum, People's Vote organised a march and protest from Trafalgar Square to Parliament Square in Central London. Speakers included Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable, Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas, Labour's David Lammy and the Conservatives' Anna Soubry. The organisers said that at least 100,000 people attended the march. A smaller pro-Brexit march was held in London on the same date.\n\nThe People's Vote march was not designed to reverse the result of the referendum, but to hold a public vote on the final terms of the UK's EU exit deal. The organisers said Brexit was \"not a done deal\" and Cable said \"Brexit is not inevitable. Brexit can be stopped.\" The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was criticised for not attending the march.\n\nOn 20 October 2018, organisers estimated that 700,000 people attended the march jointly organised by People's Vote and the UK newspaper \"The Independent\", although police were unable to verify the number. The aim of the march was to secure a vote on the final Brexit deal. The march organisers stated: \"Whether you voted leave or remain, nobody voted to make this country worse off, to harm jobs, to damage the NHS, to affect the future of millions of young people, or to make this country more divided. The more the shape of the final Brexit deal becomes clear, the more it is clear that it will do nothing to improve social justice, reduce inequality, increase our standard of living, or create a better future for future generations.\" A number of celebrities, including Delia Smith, Ian McEwan, Sir Patrick Stewart and Charlie Mullins, stated that they would fund coach travel to London, to enable those wishing to attend the march to do so. If the organisers' stated estimate of the attendance was correct, then the event was the second-largest protest of the 21st century in the UK, after the \"Stop the War\" anti-Iraq War march in 2003.\n\nMembers of national groups, including Britain for Europe, European Movement UK, Open Britain, conduct joint campaigns in various towns and cities of the UK.\n\nIn March 2018 six national groups moved into a shared Remain office in Millbank Tower, London, in order to pool their resources for campaigning.\n\nLaunched in April 2018, People's Vote is a UK campaign group calling for a public vote on the final Brexit deal. The campaign comprises nine anti-Brexit groups, including eight operating from Millbank Tower. The groups include the five listed below, plus For our Future's Sake (FFS), InFacts, and Open Britain, along with Wales for Europe working from Wales.\n\nBritain for Europe was established shortly after the EU referendum. It is an independent pressure group and umbrella organisation for grassroot activists from around the UK. It lobbies in favour of the UK remaining in the EU. The group organises marches, conferences, meetings, and national campaigns. It is a founding member of People's Vote.\n\nThe Chair of Britain for Europe is Tom Brufatto. Britain for Europe is organised from the grassroots membership.\n\nThe organisation has about sixty member affiliated groups including:\n\nIn January 2017, the affiliate group Leeds for Europe formed. It campaigns against Brexit in the city of Leeds and elsewhere in West Yorkshire. Leeds for Europe is also affiliated to the European Movement UK.\n\nEuropean Movement UK is an organisation which campaigns in support of greater European integration and for reform of the EU. It is part of the European Movement International, which pushes for a \"democratic, federal, enlarged European Union\".\n\nFormed in 1949, it campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum and continues to oppose Brexit in collaboration with other major pro-European campaign groups such as Open Britain and Britain for Europe.\n\nHealthier IN the EU was co-founded in 2016 by Mike Galsworthy, Rob Davidson, and Martin McKee. Its advisory board included former Chief Executive of the NHS in England Nigel Crisp, former Minister for Health John Bowis, former Chief Medical Officer for Scotland Harry Burns, former President of the Royal College of Physicians Ian Gilmore, President of Royal College of Psychiatrists Simon Wessely, and the editor of The Lancet, Richard Horton. Healthier in the EU is a grassroots organization making the health case for continued EU membership. \n\nShortly before the 2017 general election, Healthier IN the EU and Vote Leave Watch organized an open letter calling on the Conservative Party to commit to spending an extra £350m per week on the NHS after Brexit. The letter was signed by some of the UK's leading medical professionals. The amount of £350m per week corresponded to the savings attributable to Brexit claimed by the Vote Leave campaign. Following the publication of the letter, foreign secretary Boris Johnson received negative press coverage for falsely claiming that the pledge was already in the Conservative Party election manifesto.\n\nHealthier IN the EU is a founding member of People's Vote.\n\nOur Future Our Choice (OFOC) was incorporated as a company on 19 February 2018 and is aimed towards young adults. Its four founding members are Femi Oluwole (spokesman), Calum Millbank-Murphy (spokesman), Lara Spirit (co-president) and Will Dry (co-president). \n\nOur Future Our Choice is a founding member of People's Vote.\n\nScientists for EU is a pro-EU research advocacy group. It was co-founded by scientists Mike Galsworthy and Rob Davison on 8 May 2015, the day after the UK general election 2015. Its advisory board included high-profile UK scientists, including former EU chief scientific advisor Anne Glover, and MPs from different political parties. Galsworthy articulated two concerns that Scientists for EU aimed to address: \"first, a lack of clarity and cohesion within the community on EU benefits and Brexit risks; and, secondly, a lack of public understanding on the UK/EU relationship in science.\" \n\nFollowing the referendum, hundreds of scientists contacted Scientists for EU voicing concerns about the future of scientific research in the UK after Brexit, many saying they planned to leave the UK; for some, xenophobia was a significant concern. Programme Director Galsworthy concluded, \"It is clear that the UK has overnight become less attractive as a place to do science.\" \n\nScientists for EU has continued to publicize the benefits of EU membership for Britain and the negative consequences of Brexit for science and healthcare, including uncertainty over immigration and funding, and the loss of influence over EU regulations and policy. \n\nIn February 2018 George Soros's Open Society Foundations donated £500,000 to a number of groups opposing Brexit including £35,000 to Scientists for EU. \n\nScientists for EU is a founding member of People's Vote.\n\nDavid Wilkinson's full-length film Postcards from the 48% (2018) opened on 23 June 2018 at the Edinburgh International Film Festival and went on general release on 6 July 2018. The documentary was made by, and featured, members of the 48% of voters who chose Remain in the referendum. A reviewer for \"The Times\" wrote that it \"gives voice to the fears and the hopes of the nation's discontented remainers\".\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigners gave away EU flags to audience members at the last night of The Proms in 2016 and 2017.\n\nThe No. 10 Vigil campaign group, which holds regular demonstrations outside Downing Street, organized a boat trip on the Thames on 19 August 2017. A subsequent boat trip occurred on 24 July 2018.\n"}

The play takes the form of a pantomime, complete with Dick Whittington (played as a principal boy), a pantomime dame, and two pantomime horses. The book and lyrics were written by Peter Nichols; the composer was Monty Norman.\n\nThe year is 1840. The Emperor of China warns the young Queen Victoria to know her place - \"The Emperor's Greeting\". The scene is set, panto-style, in a quaint, cardboard English village, \"Dunroamin-on-the-Down\", ancestral home of Sir Richard (Dick) Whittington and his widowed mother Lady Dodo.\n\nDick sets off with his manservant Jack Idle and the men of the village to seek their fortune in London or in the new towns of the Industrial Revolution. Jack is sad to leave his girlfriend, Sally. His horse Randy and her mare Cherry also fancy each other and have to be rebuked for their friskiness - \"Whoa, Boy\". Lady Dodo pines for the good old days, but Dick believes the age of gold is yet to come.\n\nSally, left with her mare, sings of her confusion. She likes Jack but pines for Sir Richard, who is also her legal guardian. Secretly, she and Dodo take off on their own for London.\n\nIn the City, Dick encounters Obadiah Upward, an up-and-coming merchant, who explains how their fortunes can be made in distant China from the sale of poppies. Dodo and Sally arrive and they agree to make the journey.\n\nThey sail to India, and, in the poppy fields, Dodo tells Upward why she loves him - \"Nostalgie de la Boue\". Dick and Jack reflect on British India, the East India Company and the Battle of Plassey in a Kipling-esque ballad - \"John Companee\"\n\nEn route for China aboard one of Upward's opium clippers, Dick persuades Jack and Sally to sample their wares, and they savour a pipe dream of paradise.\n\nThe Emperor of China tells Victoria to stop the cultivation of poppies, but she replies that the \"Bounty of the Earth\" is to be shared by every nation. She leaves him alone to lament his son's addiction to the drug. He sends Commissioner Lin to Canton to stamp out the trade. Here, Lin meets Viceroy Teng and his daughter Yoyo who is confused by Europeans - \"They All Look the Same To Us\".\n\nObadiah refuses to be intimidated by Lin's threats and sends Dick up the coast to seek fresh markets. Victoria joins his crew as an interpreter and Christian missionary and is questioned on her religious scruples. She explains there is a blessed trinity that justifies trade - \"Blessed Trinity\" (of Civilisation, Commerce and Christianity). \n\nBefore they leave, Dodo guesses that Sally loves Dick and tells her he is not only her guardian but also her half-brother.\n\nThe Chinese lay siege to the European compound, and the animals have to be slaughtered for food. Jack sings Randy a last lullaby before killing him - \"Rock-A-Bye Randy\"\n\nIn the war that follows, the Chinese are defeated and surrender Hong Kong Island. Dodo and Upward sing of how the British and French soldiers sacked the Imperial Summer Palace in Peking - \"Rat-a-Tat-Tat\".\n\nThough there are dark and savage undertones to this fairy tale, in the end, most of the British live happily ever after, and it is the Chinese who learn to know their place.\n\nAct One\n\nAct Two\n\n\"Poppy\" premiered on 25 September 1982 at the Barbican Centre performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company. That year, it won the Laurence Olivier Award for best new musical. On 14 November 1983, the play was moved to the Adelphi Theatre and ran until 18 February 1984. The show was revived in December 1988 at the now-closed Half Moon Theatre (with Louise Gold as Dick Whittington), in 1998 by the Chelsea Players, and again in March 2005 by the Italia Conti Academy at the Landor Theatre.\n\nA 'script-in-hand' performance was given as part of the Royal Shakespeare Company's 50th Birthday Celebrations on 9 July 2011, directed by Mark Ravenhill, with both Peter Nichols and Monty Norman in the audience.\n\n"}
{"id": "1724836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1724836", "title": "Reliability engineering", "text": "Reliability engineering\n\nReliability engineering is a sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes dependability in the lifecycle management of a product. Dependability, or reliability, describes the ability of a system or component to function under stated conditions for a specified period of time. Reliability is closely related to availability, which is typically described as the ability of a component or system to function at a specified moment or interval of time.\n\nReliability is theoretically defined as the probability of success formula_1 as the frequency of failures; or in terms of availability, as a probability derived from reliability, testability and maintainability. Testability, maintainability and maintenance are often defined as a part of \"reliability engineering\" in Reliability Programs. Reliability plays a key role in the cost-effectiveness of systems.\n\nReliability engineering deals with the estimation, prevention and management of high levels of \"lifetime\" engineering uncertainty and risks of failure. Although stochastic parameters define and affect reliability, reliability is not (solely) achieved by mathematics and statistics. One cannot really find a root cause (needed to effectively prevent failures) by only looking at statistics. \"Nearly all teaching and literature on the subject emphasize these aspects, and ignore the reality that the ranges of uncertainty involved largely invalidate quantitative methods for prediction and measurement.\" For example, it is easy to represent \"probability of failure\" as a symbol or value in an equation, but it is almost impossible to predict its true magnitude in practice, which is massively multivariate, so having the equation for reliability does not begin to equal having an accurate predictive measurement of reliability. \n\nReliability engineering relates closely to safety engineering and to system safety, in that they use common methods for their analysis and may require input from each other. Reliability engineering focuses on costs of failure caused by system downtime, cost of spares, repair equipment, personnel, and cost of warranty claims. Safety engineering normally focuses more on preserving life and nature than on cost, and therefore deals only with particularly dangerous system-failure modes. High reliability (safety factor) levels also result from good engineering and from attention to detail, and almost never from only reactive failure management (using reliability accounting and statistics).\n\nThe word \"reliability\" can be traced back to 1816, and is first attested to the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Before World War II the term was linked mostly to repeatability; a test (in any type of science) was considered \"reliable\" if the same results would be obtained repeatedly. In the 1920s product improvement through the use of statistical process control was promoted by Dr. Walter A. Shewhart at Bell Labs, around the time that Waloddi Weibull was working on statistical models for fatigue. The development of reliability engineering was here on a parallel path with quality. The modern use of the word reliability was defined by the U.S. military in the 1940s, characterizing a product that would operate when expected and for a specified period of time.\n\nIn World War II, many reliability issues were due to the inherent unreliability of electronic equipment available at the time, and to fatigue issues. In 1945, M.A. Miner published the seminal paper titled \"Cumulative Damage in Fatigue\" in an ASME journal. A main application for reliability engineering in the military was for the vacuum tube as used in radar systems and other electronics, for which reliability proved to be very problematic and costly. The IEEE formed the Reliability Society in 1948. In 1950, the United States Department of Defense formed group called the \"Advisory Group on the Reliability of Electronic Equipment\" (AGREE) to investigate reliability methods for military equipment. This group recommended three main ways of working:\n\n\nIn the 1960s more emphasis was given to reliability testing on component and system level. The famous military standard 781 was created at that time. Around this period also the much-used (and also much-debated) military handbook 217 was published by RCA (Radio Corporation of America) and was used for the prediction of failure rates of components. The emphasis on component reliability and empirical research (e.g. Mil Std 217) alone slowly decreases. More pragmatic approaches, as used in the consumer industries, are being used. In the 1980s, televisions were increasingly made up of solid-state semiconductors. Automobiles rapidly increased their use of semiconductors with a variety of microcomputers under the hood and in the dash. Large air conditioning systems developed electronic controllers, as had microwave ovens and a variety of other appliances. Communications systems began to adopt\nelectronics to replace older mechanical switching systems. Bellcore issued the first consumer prediction methodology for telecommunications, and SAE developed a similar document SAE870050 for automotive applications. The nature of predictions evolved during the decade, and it became apparent that die complexity wasn't the only factor that determined failure rates for Integrated Circuits (ICs).\nKam Wong published a paper questioning the bathtub curve—see also reliability-centered maintenance. During this decade, the failure rate of many components dropped by a factor of 10. Software became important to the reliability of systems. By the 1990s, the pace of IC development was picking up. Wider use of stand-alone microcomputers was common, and the PC market helped keep IC densities following Moore's law and doubling about every 18 months. Reliability engineering now was more changing towards understanding the physics of failure. Failure rates for components kept on dropping, but system-level issues became more prominent. Systems thinking became more and more important. For software, the CCM model (Capability Maturity Model) was developed, which gave a more qualitative approach to reliability. ISO 9000 added reliability measures as part of the design and development portion of Certification. The expansion of the World-Wide Web created new challenges of security and trust. The older problem of too little reliability information available had now been replaced by too much information of questionable value. Consumer reliability problems could now have data and be discussed online in real time. New technologies such as micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), handheld GPS, and hand-held devices that combined cell phones and computers all represent challenges to maintain reliability. Product development time continued to shorten through this\ndecade and what had been done in three years was being done in 18 months. This meant that reliability tools and tasks must be more closely tied to the development process itself. In many ways, reliability became part of everyday life and consumer expectations.\n\nThe objectives of reliability engineering, in decreasing order of priority, are:\n\n\nThe reason for the priority emphasis is that it is by far the most effective way of working, in terms of minimizing costs and generating reliable products. The primary skills that are required, therefore, are the ability to understand and anticipate the possible causes of failures, and knowledge of how to prevent them. It is also necessary to have knowledge of the methods that can be used for analysing designs and data.\n\nReliability engineering for \"complex systems\" requires a different, more elaborate systems approach than for non-complex systems. Reliability engineering may in that case involve:\n\n\nEffective reliability engineering requires understanding of the basics of failure mechanisms for which experience, broad engineering skills and good knowledge from many different special fields of engineering, for example:\n\n\nReliability may be defined in the following ways:\n\nMany engineering techniques are used in reliability risk assessments, such as reliability hazard analysis, failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), fault tree analysis (FTA), Reliability Centered Maintenance, (probabilistic) load and material stress and wear calculations, (probabilistic) fatigue and creep analysis, human error analysis, manufacturing defect analysis, reliability testing, etc. It is crucial that these analysis are done properly and with much attention to detail to be effective. Because of the large number of reliability techniques, their expense, and the varying degrees of reliability required for different situations, most projects develop a reliability program plan to specify the reliability tasks (statement of work (SoW) requirements) that will be performed for that specific system.\n\nConsistent with the creation of a safety cases, for example ARP4761, the goal of reliability assessments is to provide a robust set of qualitative and quantitative evidence that use of a component or system will not be associated with unacceptable risk. The basic steps to take are to:\n\nRisk here is the combination of probability and severity of the failure incident (scenario) occurring.\n\nIn a \"de minimis\" definition, severity of failures includes the cost of spare parts, man-hours, logistics, damage (secondary failures), and downtime of machines which may cause production loss. A more complete definition of failure also can mean injury, dismemberment, and death of people within the system (witness mine accidents, industrial accidents, space shuttle failures) and the same to innocent bystanders (witness the citizenry of cities like Bhopal, Love Canal, Chernobyl, or Sendai, and other victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami)—in this case, reliability engineering becomes system safety. What is acceptable is determined by the managing authority or customers or the affected communities. Residual risk is the risk that is left over after all reliability activities have finished, and includes the un-identified risk—and is therefore not completely quantifiable.\n\nThe complexity of the technical systems such as Improvements of Design and Materials, Planned Inspections, Fool-proof design, and Backup Redundancy decreases risk and increases the cost. The risk can be decreased to ALARA (as low as reasonably achievable) or ALAPA (as low as practically achievable) levels.\n\nImplementing a reliability program is not simply a software purchase; it's not just a checklist of items that must be completed that will ensure one has reliable products and processes. A reliability program is a complex learning and knowledge-based system unique to one's products and processes. It is supported by leadership, built on the skills that one develops within a team, integrated into business processes and executed by following proven standard work practices.\n\nA reliability program plan is used to document exactly what \"best practices\" (tasks, methods, tools, analysis, and tests) are required for a particular (sub)system, as well as clarify customer requirements for reliability assessment. For large-scale complex systems, the reliability program plan should be a separate document. Resource determination for manpower and budgets for testing and other tasks is critical for a successful program. In general, the amount of work required for an effective program for complex systems is large.\n\nA reliability program plan is essential for achieving high levels of reliability, testability, maintainability, and the resulting system Availability, and is developed early during system development and refined over the system's life-cycle. It specifies not only what the reliability engineer does, but also the tasks performed by other stakeholders. A reliability program plan is approved by top program Management, which is responsible for allocation of sufficient resources for its implementation.\n\nA reliability program plan may also be used to evaluate and improve the availability of a system by the strategy of focusing on increasing testability & maintainability and not on reliability. Improving maintainability is generally easier than improving reliability. Maintainability estimates (repair rates) are also generally more accurate. However, because the uncertainties in the reliability estimates are in most cases very large, they are likely to dominate the availability calculation (prediction uncertainty problem), even when maintainability levels are very high. When reliability is not under control, more complicated issues may arise, like manpower (maintainers / customer service capability) shortages, spare part availability, logistic delays, lack of repair facilities, extensive retro-fit and complex configuration management costs, and others. The problem of unreliability may be increased also due to the \"domino effect\" of maintenance-induced failures after repairs. Focusing only on maintainability is therefore not enough. If failures are prevented, none of the other issues are of any importance, and therefore reliability is generally regarded as the most important part of availability. Reliability needs to be evaluated and improved related to both availability and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) due to cost of spare parts, maintenance man-hours, transport costs, storage cost, part obsolete risks, etc. But, as GM and Toyota have belatedly discovered, TCO also includes the downstream liability costs when reliability calculations have not sufficiently or accurately addressed customers' personal bodily risks. Often a trade-off is needed between the two. There might be a maximum ratio between availability and cost of ownership. Testability of a system should also be addressed in the plan, as this is the link between reliability and maintainability. The maintenance strategy can influence the reliability of a system (e.g., by preventive and/or predictive maintenance), although it can never bring it above the inherent reliability.\n\nThe reliability plan should clearly provide a strategy for availability control. Whether only availability or also cost of ownership is more important depends on the use of the system. For example, a system that is a critical link in a production system—e.g., a big oil platform—is normally allowed to have a very high cost of ownership if that cost translates to even a minor increase in availability, as the unavailability of the platform results in a massive loss of revenue which can easily exceed the high cost of ownership. A proper reliability plan should always address RAMT analysis in its total context. RAMT stands for reliability, availability, maintainability/maintenance, and testability in the context of the customer's needs.\n\nFor any system, one of the first tasks of reliability engineering is to adequately specify the reliability and maintainability requirements allocated from the overall availability needs and, more importantly, derived from proper design failure analysis or preliminary prototype test results. Clear requirements (able to designed to) should constrain the designers from designing particular unreliable items / constructions / interfaces / systems. Setting only availability, reliability, testability, or maintainability targets (e.g., max. failure rates) is not appropriate. This is a broad misunderstanding about Reliability Requirements Engineering. Reliability requirements address the system itself, including test and assessment requirements, and associated tasks and documentation. Reliability requirements are included in the appropriate system or subsystem requirements specifications, test plans, and contract statements. Creation of proper lower-level requirements is critical.\nProvision of only quantitative minimum targets (e.g., MTBF values or failure rates) is not sufficient for different reasons. One reason is that a full validation (related to correctness and verifiability in time) of a quantitative reliability allocation (requirement spec) on lower levels for complex systems can (often) not be made as a consequence of (1) the fact that the requirements are probabilistic, (2) the extremely high level of uncertainties involved for showing compliance with all these probabilistic requirements, and because (3) reliability is a function of time, and accurate estimates of a (probabilistic) reliability number per item are available only very late in the project, sometimes even after many years of in-service use. Compare this problem with the continuous (re-)balancing of, for example, lower-level-system mass requirements in the development of an aircraft, which is already often a big undertaking. Notice that in this case, masses do only differ in terms of only some %, are not a function of time, the data is non-probabilistic and available already in CAD models. In case of reliability, the levels of unreliability (failure rates) may change with factors of decades (multiples of 10) as result of very minor deviations in design, process, or anything else. The information is often not available without huge uncertainties within the development phase. This makes this allocation problem almost impossible to do in a useful, practical, valid manner that does not result in massive over- or under-specification. A pragmatic approach is therefore needed—for example: the use of general levels / classes of quantitative requirements depending only on severity of failure effects. Also, the validation of results is a far more subjective task than for any other type of requirement. (Quantitative) reliability parameters—in terms of MTBF—are by far the most uncertain design parameters in any design.\n\nFurthermore, reliability design requirements should drive a (system or part) design to incorporate features that prevent failures from occurring, or limit consequences from failure in the first place. Not only would it aid in some predictions, this effort would keep from distracting the engineering effort into a kind of accounting work. A design requirement should be precise enough so that a designer can \"design to\" it and can also prove—through analysis or testing—that the requirement has been achieved, and, if possible, within some a stated confidence. Any type of reliability requirement should be detailed and could be derived from failure analysis (Finite-Element Stress and Fatigue analysis, Reliability Hazard Analysis, FTA, FMEA, Human Factor Analysis, Functional Hazard Analysis, etc.) or any type of reliability testing. Also, requirements are needed for verification tests (e.g., required overload stresses) and test time needed. To derive these requirements in an effective manner, a systems engineering-based risk assessment and mitigation logic should be used. Robust hazard log systems must be created that contain detailed information on why and how systems could or have failed. Requirements are to be derived and tracked in this way. These practical design requirements shall drive the design and not be used only for verification purposes. These requirements (often design constraints) are in this way derived from failure analysis or preliminary tests. Understanding of this difference compared to only purely quantitative (logistic) requirement specification (e.g., Failure Rate / MTBF target) is paramount in the development of successful (complex) systems.\n\nThe maintainability requirements address the costs of repairs as well as repair time. Testability (not to be confused with test requirements) requirements provide the link between reliability and maintainability and should address detectability of failure modes (on a particular system level), isolation levels, and the creation of diagnostics (procedures).\nAs indicated above, reliability engineers should also address requirements for various reliability tasks and documentation during system development, testing, production, and operation. These requirements are generally specified in the contract statement of work and depend on how much leeway the customer wishes to provide to the contractor. Reliability tasks include various analyses, planning, and failure reporting. Task selection depends on the criticality of the system as well as cost. A safety-critical system may require a formal failure reporting and review process throughout development, whereas a non-critical system may rely on final test reports. The most common reliability program tasks are documented in reliability program standards, such as MIL-STD-785 and IEEE 1332. Failure reporting analysis and corrective action systems are a common approach for product/process reliability monitoring.\n\nIn practice, most failures can be traced back to some type of human error, for example in:\n\n\nHowever, humans are also very good at detecting such failures, correcting for them, and improvising when abnormal situations occur. Therefore, policies that completely rule out human actions in design and production processes to improve reliability may not be effective. Some tasks are better performed by humans and some are better performed by machines.\n\nFurthermore, human errors in management; the organization of data and information; or the misuse or abuse of items, may also contribute to unreliability. This is the core reason why high levels of reliability for complex systems can only be achieved by following a robust systems engineering process with proper planning and execution of the validation and verification tasks. This also includes careful organization of data and information sharing and creating a \"reliability culture\", in the same way that having a \"safety culture\" is paramount in the development of safety critical systems.\n\nReliability prediction combines:\n\n\nSome recognized reliability engineering specialists (e.g. Patrick O'Connor, R. Barnard) have argued that too much emphasis is often given to the prediction of reliability parameters, instead more effort should be devoted to the prevention of failure (reliability improvement). Failures can and should be prevented in the first place for most cases. The emphasis on quantification and target setting (e.g. MTBF) might imply there is a limit to achievable reliability, however, there is no inherent limit and development of higher reliability does not need to be more costly. In addition, they argue that prediction of reliability from historic data can be very misleading, with comparisons only valid for identical designs, products, manufacturing processes, and maintenance with identical operating loads and usage environments. Even minor changes in any of these could have major effects on reliability. Furthermore, the most unreliable and important items (i.e. the most interesting candidates for a reliability investigation) are most likely to be modified and re-engineered since historical data was gathered, making the standard (re-active or pro-active) statistical methods and processes used in e.g. medical or insurance industries less effective. Another surprising — but logical — argument is that to be able to accurately predict reliability by testing, the exact mechanisms of failure must be known and therefore — in most cases — could be prevented! Following the incorrect route of trying to quantify and solve a complex reliability engineering problem in terms of MTBF or probability using an-incorrect – for example, the re-active – approach is referred to by Barnard as \"Playing the Numbers Game\" and is regarded as bad practice.\n\nFor existing systems, it is arguable that any attempt by a responsible program to correct the root cause of discovered failures may render the initial MTBF estimate invalid, as new assumptions (themselves subject to high error levels) of the effect of this correction must be made. Another practical issue is the general unavailability of detailed failure data, with those available often featuring inconsistent filtering of failure (feedback) data, and ignoring statistical errors (which are very high for rare events like reliability related failures). Very clear guidelines must be present to count and compare failures related to different type of root-causes (e.g. manufacturing-, maintenance-, transport-, system-induced or inherent design failures). Comparing different types of causes may lead to incorrect estimations and incorrect business decisions about the focus of improvement.\n\nTo perform a proper quantitative reliability prediction for systems may be difficult and very expensive if done by testing. At the individual part-level, reliability results can often be obtained with comparatively high confidence, as testing of many sample parts might be possible using the available testing budget. However, unfortunately these tests may lack validity at a system-level due to assumptions made at part-level testing. These authors emphasized the importance of initial part- or system-level testing until failure, and to learn from such failures to improve the system or part. The general conclusion is drawn that an accurate and absolute prediction — by either field-data comparison or testing — of reliability is in most cases not possible. An exception might be failures due to wear-out problems such as fatigue failures. In the introduction of MIL-STD-785 it is written that reliability prediction should be used with great caution, if not used solely for comparison in trade-off studies.\n\nDesign for Reliability (DfR) is a process that encompasses tools and procedures to ensure that a product meets its reliability requirements, under its use environment, for the duration of its lifetime. DfR is implemented in the design stage of a product to proactively improve product reliability. DfR is often used as part of an overall Design for Excellence (DfX) strategy. \n\nReliability design begins with the development of a (system) model. Reliability and availability models use block diagrams and Fault Tree Analysis to provide a graphical means of evaluating the relationships between different parts of the system. These models may incorporate predictions based on failure rates taken from historical data. While the (input data) predictions are often not accurate in an absolute sense, they are valuable to assess relative differences in design alternatives. Maintainability parameters, for example Mean time to repair (MTTR), can also be used as inputs for such models.\n\nThe most important fundamental initiating causes and failure mechanisms are to be identified and analyzed with engineering tools. A diverse set of practical guidance as to performance and reliability should be provided to designers so that they can generate low-stressed designs and products that protect, or are protected against, damage and excessive wear. Proper validation of input loads (requirements) may be needed, in addition to verification for reliability \"performance\" by testing.\nOne of the most important design techniques is redundancy. This means that if one part of the system fails, there is an alternate success path, such as a backup system. The reason why this is the ultimate design choice is related to the fact that high-confidence reliability evidence for new parts or systems is often not available, or is extremely expensive to obtain. By combining redundancy, together with a high level of failure monitoring, and the avoidance of common cause failures; even a system with relatively poor single-channel (part) reliability, can be made highly reliable at a system level (up to mission critical reliability). No testing of reliability has to be required for this. In conjunction with redundancy, the use of dissimilar designs or manufacturing processes (e.g. via different suppliers of similar parts) for single independent channels, can provide less sensitivity to quality issues (e.g. early childhood failures at a single supplier), allowing very-high levels of reliability to be achieved at all moments of the development cycle (from early life to long-term). Redundancy can also be applied in systems engineering by double checking requirements, data, designs, calculations, software, and tests to overcome systematic failures.\n\nAnother effective way to deal with reliability issues is to perform analysis that predicts degradation, enabling the prevention of unscheduled downtime events / failures. RCM (Reliability Centered Maintenance) programs can be used for this.\n\nFor electronic assemblies, there has been an increasing shift towards a different approach called physics of failure. This technique relies on understanding the physical static and dynamic failure mechanisms. It accounts for variation in load, strength, and stress that lead to failure with a high level of detail, made possible with the use of modern finite element method (FEM) software programs that can handle complex geometries and mechanisms such as creep, stress relaxation, fatigue, and probabilistic design (Monte Carlo Methods/DOE). The material or component can be re-designed to reduce the probability of failure and to make it more robust against such variations. Another common design technique is component derating: i.e. selecting components whose specifications significantly exceed the expected stress levels, such as using heavier gauge electrical wire than might normally be specified for the expected electric current.\n\nMany of the tasks, techniques, and analyses used in Reliability Engineering are specific to particular industries and applications, but can commonly include:\n\nResults from these methods are presented during reviews of part or system design, and logistics. Reliability is just one requirement among many for a complex part or system. Engineering trade-off studies are used to determine the optimum balance between reliability requirements and other constraints.\n\nReliability engineers, whether using quantitative or qualitative methods to describe a failure or hazard, rely on language to pinpoint the risks and enable issues to be solved. The language used must help create an orderly description of the function/item/system and its complex surrounding as it relates to the failure of these functions/items/systems. Systems engineering is very much about finding the correct words to describe the problem (and related risks), so that they can be readily solved via engineering solutions. Jack Ring said that a systems engineer's job is to \"language the project.\" (Ring et al. 2000) For part/system failures, reliability engineers should concentrate more on the \"why and how\", rather that predicting \"when\". Understanding \"why\" a failure has occurred (e.g. due to over-stressed components or manufacturing issues) is far more likely to lead to improvement in the designs and processes used than quantifying \"when\" a failure is likely to occur (e.g. via determining MTBF). To do this, first the reliability hazards relating to the part/system need to be classified and ordered (based on some form of qualitative and quantitative logic if possible) to allow for more efficient assessment and eventual improvement. This is partly done in pure language and proposition logic, but also based on experience with similar items. This can for example be seen in descriptions of events in fault tree analysis, FMEA analysis, and hazard (tracking) logs. In this sense language and proper grammar (part of qualitative analysis) plays an important role in reliability engineering, just like it does in safety engineering or in-general within systems engineering.\n\nCorrect use of language can also be key to identifying or reducing the risks of human error, which are often the root cause of many failures. This can include proper instructions in maintenance manuals, operation manuals, emergency procedures, and others to prevent systematic human errors that may result in system failures. These should be written by trained or experienced technical authors using so-called simplified English or Simplified Technical English, where words and structure are specifically chosen and created so as to reduce ambiguity or risk of confusion (e.g. an \"replace the old part\" could ambiguously refer to a swapping a worn-out part with a non worn-out part, or replacing a part with one using a more recent and hopefully improved design).\n\nReliability modeling is the process of predicting or understanding the reliability of a component or system prior to its implementation. Two types of analysis that are often used to model a complete system's availability behavior (including effects from logistics issues like spare part provisioning, transport and manpower) are Fault Tree Analysis and reliability block diagrams. At a component level, the same types of analyses can be used together with others. The input for the models can come from many sources including testing; prior operational experience; field data; as well as data handbooks from similar or related industries. Regardless of source, all model input data must be used with great caution, as predictions are only valid in cases where the same product was used in the same context. As such, predictions are often only used to help compare alternatives.\n\nFor part level predictions, two separate fields of investigation are common:\nSoftware reliability is a more challenging area that must be considered when computer code provides a considerable component of a system's functionality.\n\nReliability is defined as the probability that a device will perform its intended function during a specified period of time under stated conditions. Mathematically, this may be expressed as,\n\nwhere formula_3 is the failure probability density function and formula_4 is the length of the period of time (which is assumed to start from time zero).\n\nThere are a few key elements of this definition:\n\n\nQuantitative requirements are specified using reliability parameters. The most common reliability parameter is the mean time to failure (MTTF), which can also be specified as the failure rate (this is expressed as a frequency or conditional probability density function (PDF)) or the number of failures during a given period. These parameters may be useful for higher system levels and systems that are operated frequently (i.e. vehicles, machinery, and electronic equipment). Reliability increases as the MTTF increases. The MTTF is usually specified in hours, but can also be used with other units of measurement, such as miles or cycles. Using MTTF values on lower system levels can be very misleading, especially if they do not specify the associated Failures Modes and Mechanisms (The F in MTTF).\n\nIn other cases, reliability is specified as the probability of mission success. For example, reliability of a scheduled aircraft flight can be specified as a dimensionless probability or a percentage, as often used in system safety engineering.\n\nA special case of mission success is the single-shot device or system. These are devices or systems that remain relatively dormant and only operate once. Examples include automobile airbags, thermal batteries and missiles. Single-shot reliability is specified as a probability of one-time success or is subsumed into a related parameter. Single-shot missile reliability may be specified as a requirement for the probability of a hit. For such systems, the probability of failure on demand (PFD) is the reliability measure — this is actually an \"unavailability\" number. The PFD is derived from failure rate (a frequency of occurrence) and mission time for non-repairable systems.\n\nFor repairable systems, it is obtained from failure rate, mean-time-to-repair (MTTR), and test interval. This measure may not be unique for a given system as this measure depends on the kind of demand. In addition to system level requirements, reliability requirements may be specified for critical subsystems. In most cases, reliability parameters are specified with appropriate statistical confidence intervals.\n\nThe purpose of reliability testing is to discover potential problems with the design as early as possible and, ultimately, provide confidence that the system meets its reliability requirements.\n\nReliability testing may be performed at several levels and there are different types of testing. Complex systems may be tested at component, circuit board, unit, assembly, subsystem and system levels.\n(The test level nomenclature varies among applications.) For example, performing environmental stress screening tests at lower levels, such as piece parts or small assemblies, catches problems before they cause failures at higher levels. Testing proceeds during each level of integration through full-up system testing, developmental testing, and operational testing, thereby reducing program risk. However, testing does not mitigate unreliability risk.\n\nWith each test both a statistical type 1 and type 2 error could be made and depends on sample size, test time, assumptions and the needed discrimination ratio. There is risk of incorrectly accepting a bad design (type 1 error) and the risk of incorrectly rejecting a good design (type 2 error).\n\nIt is not always feasible to test all system requirements. Some systems are prohibitively expensive to test; some failure modes may take years to observe; some complex interactions result in a huge number of possible test cases; and some tests require the use of limited test ranges or other resources. In such cases, different approaches to testing can be used, such as (highly) accelerated life testing, design of experiments, and simulations.\n\nThe desired level of statistical confidence also plays a role in reliability testing. Statistical confidence is increased by increasing either the test time or the number of items tested. Reliability test plans are designed to achieve the specified reliability at the specified confidence level with the minimum number of test units and test time. Different test plans result in different levels of risk to the producer and consumer. The desired reliability, statistical confidence, and risk levels for each side influence the ultimate test plan. The customer and developer should agree in advance on how reliability requirements will be tested.\n\nA key aspect of reliability testing is to define \"failure\". Although this may seem obvious, there are many situations where it is not clear whether a failure is really the fault of the system. Variations in test conditions, operator differences, weather and unexpected situations create differences between the customer and the system developer. One strategy to address this issue is to use a scoring conference process. A scoring conference includes representatives from the customer, the developer, the test organization, the reliability organization, and sometimes independent observers. The scoring conference process is defined in the statement of work. Each test case is considered by the group and \"scored\" as a success or failure. This scoring is the official result used by the reliability engineer.\n\nAs part of the requirements phase, the reliability engineer develops a test strategy with the customer. The test strategy makes trade-offs between the needs of the reliability organization, which wants as much data as possible, and constraints such as cost, schedule and available resources. Test plans and procedures are developed for each reliability test, and results are documented.\n\nReliability testing is common in the Photonics industry. Examples of reliability tests of lasers are life test and burn-in. These tests consist of the highly accelerated aging, under controlled conditions, of a group of lasers. The data collected from these life tests are used to predict laser life expectancy under the intended operating characteristics.\n\nReliability test requirements can follow from any analysis for which the first estimate of failure probability, failure mode or effect needs to be justified. Evidence can be generated with some level of confidence by testing. With software-based systems, the probability is a mix of software and hardware-based failures. Testing reliability requirements is problematic for several reasons. A single test is in most cases insufficient to generate enough statistical data. Multiple tests or long-duration tests are usually very expensive. Some tests are simply impractical, and environmental conditions can be hard to predict over a systems life-cycle.\n\nReliability engineering is used to design a realistic and affordable test program that provides empirical evidence that the system meets its reliability requirements. Statistical confidence levels are used to address some of these concerns. A certain parameter is expressed along with a corresponding confidence level: for example, an MTBF of 1000 hours at 90% confidence level. From this specification, the reliability engineer can, for example, design a test with explicit criteria for the number of hours and number of failures until the requirement is met or failed. Different sorts of tests are possible.\n\nThe combination of required reliability level and required confidence level greatly affects the development cost and the risk to both the customer and producer. Care is needed to select the best combination of requirements—e.g. cost-effectiveness. Reliability testing may be performed at various levels, such as component, subsystem and system. Also, many factors must be addressed during testing and operation, such as extreme temperature and humidity, shock, vibration, or other environmental factors (like loss of signal, cooling or power; or other catastrophes such as fire, floods, excessive heat, physical or security violations or other myriad forms of damage or degradation). For systems that must last many years, accelerated life tests may be needed.\n\nThe purpose of accelerated life testing (ALT test) is to induce field failure in the laboratory at a much faster rate by providing a harsher, but nonetheless representative, environment. In such a test, the product is expected to fail in the lab just as it would have failed in the field—but in much less time.\nThe main objective of an accelerated test is either of the following:\nAn Accelerated testing program can be broken down into the following steps:\n\nCommon ways to determine a life stress relationship are:\n\nSoftware reliability is a special aspect of reliability engineering. System reliability, by definition, includes all parts of the system, including hardware, software, supporting infrastructure (including critical external interfaces), operators and procedures. Traditionally, reliability engineering focuses on critical hardware parts of the system. Since the widespread use of digital integrated circuit technology, software has become an increasingly critical part of most electronics and, hence, nearly all present day systems.\n\nThere are significant differences, however, in how software and hardware behave. \nMost hardware unreliability is the result of a component or material failure that results in the system not performing its intended function. Repairing or replacing the hardware component restores the system to its original operating state. \nHowever, software does not fail in the same sense that hardware fails. Instead, software unreliability is the result of unanticipated results of software operations. Even relatively small software programs can have astronomically large combinations of inputs and states that are infeasible to exhaustively test. Restoring software to its original state only works until the same combination of inputs and states results in the same unintended result. Software reliability engineering must take this into account.\n\nDespite this difference in the source of failure between software and hardware, several software reliability models based on statistics have been proposed to quantify what we experience with software: the longer software is run, the higher the probability that it will eventually be used in an untested manner and exhibit a latent defect that results in a failure (Shooman 1987), (Musa 2005), (Denney 2005).\n\nAs with hardware, software reliability depends on good requirements, design and implementation. Software reliability engineering relies heavily on a disciplined software engineering process to anticipate and design against unintended consequences. There is more overlap between software quality engineering and software reliability engineering than between hardware quality and reliability. A good software development plan is a key aspect of the software reliability program. The software development plan describes the design and coding standards, peer reviews, unit tests, configuration management, software metrics and software models to be used during software development.\n\nA common reliability metric is the number of software faults, usually expressed as faults per thousand lines of code. This metric, along with software execution time, is key to most software reliability models and estimates. The theory is that the software reliability increases as the number of faults (or fault density) decreases or goes down. Establishing a direct connection between fault density and mean-time-between-failure is difficult, however, because of the way software faults are distributed in the code, their severity, and the probability of the combination of inputs necessary to encounter the fault. Nevertheless, fault density serves as a useful indicator for the reliability engineer. Other software metrics, such as complexity, are also used. This metric remains controversial, since changes in software development and verification practices can have dramatic impact on overall defect rates.\n\nTesting is even more important for software than hardware. Even the best software development process results in some software faults that are nearly undetectable until tested. As with hardware, software is tested at several levels, starting with individual units, through integration and full-up system testing. Unlike hardware, it is inadvisable to skip levels of software testing. During all phases of testing, software faults are discovered, corrected, and re-tested. Reliability estimates are updated based on the fault density and other metrics. At a system level, mean-time-between-failure data can be collected and used to estimate reliability. Unlike hardware, performing exactly the same test on exactly the same software configuration does not provide increased statistical confidence. Instead, software reliability uses different metrics, such as code coverage.\n\nEventually, the software is integrated with the hardware in the top-level system, and software reliability is subsumed by system reliability. The Software Engineering Institute's capability maturity model is a common means of assessing the overall software development process for reliability and quality purposes.\n\nReliability engineering is concerned with overall minimisation of failures that could lead to financial losses for the responsible entity, whereas safety engineering focuses on minimising a specific set of failure types that in general could lead to large scale, widespread issues beyond the responsible entity.\n\nReliability hazards could transform into incidents leading to a loss of revenue for the company or the customer, for example due to direct and indirect costs associated with: loss of production due to system unavailability; unexpected high or low demands for spares; repair costs; man-hours; (multiple) re-designs; interruptions to normal production etc.\n\nSafety engineering is often highly specific, relating only to certain tightly regulated industries, applications, or areas. It primarily focuses on system safety hazards that could lead to severe accidents including: loss of life; destruction of equipment; or environmental damage. As such, the related system functional reliability requirements are often extremely high. Although it deals with unwanted failures in the same sense as reliability engineering, it, however, has less of a focus on direct costs, and is not concerned with post-failure repair actions. Another difference is the level of impact of failures on society, leading to a tendency for strict control by governments or regulatory bodies (e.g. nuclear, aerospace, defense, rail and oil industries).\n\nThis can occasionally lead to safety engineering and reliability engineering having contradictory requirements or conflicting choices at a system architecture level. For example, in train signal control systems it is common practice to use a \"fail-safe\" system design concept. In this example, a wrong-side failure needs an extremely low failure rate as such failures can lead to such severe effects, like frontal collisions of two trains where a signalling failure leads to two oncoming trains on the same track being given GREEN lights. Such systems should be (and thankfully are) designed in a way that the vast majority of failures (e.g. temporary or total loss of signals or open contacts of relays) will generate RED lights for all trains. This is the safe state. This means in the event of a failure, all trains are stopped immediately. This fail-safe logic might, unfortunately, lower the reliability of the system. The reason for this is the higher risk of false tripping, as any failure whether temporary or not may be trigger such a safe – but costly – shut-down state. Different solutions can be applied for similar issues. See the section on fault tolerance below.\n\nReliability can be increased by using \"1oo2\" (1 out of 2) redundancy at a part or system level. However, if both redundant elements disagree it can be difficult to know which is to be relied upon. In the previous train signalling example this could lead to lower safety levels as there are more possibilities for allowing \"wrong side\" or other undetected dangerous failures. Fault-tolerant systems often rely on additional redundancy (e.g. 2oo3 voting logic) where multiple redundant elements must agree on a potentially unsage action before it is performed. This increases both reliability and safety at a system level and is often used for so-called \"operational\" or \"mission\" systems. This is common practice in Aerospace systems that need continued availability and do not have a fail-safe mode. For example, aircraft may use triple modular redundancy for flight computers and control surfaces (including occasionally different modes of operation e.g. electrical/mechanical/hydraulic) as these need to always be operational, due to the fact that there are no \"safe\" default positions for control surfaces such as rudders or ailerons when the aircraft is flying.\n\nThe above example of a 2oo3 fault tolerant system increases both mission reliability as well as safety. However, the \"basic\" reliability of the system will in this case still be lower than a non-redundant (1oo1) or 2oo2 system. Basic reliability engineering covers all failures, including those that might not result in system failure, but do result in additional cost due to: maintenance repair actions; logistics; spare parts etc. For example, replacement or repair of 1 faulty channel in a 2oo3 voting system, (the system is still operating, although with one failed channel it has actually become a 2oo2 system) is contributing to basic unreliability but not mission unreliability. As an example, the failure of the tail-light of an aircraft will not prevent the plane from flying (and so is not considered a mission failure), but it does need to be remedied (with a related cost, and so does contribute to the basic unreliability levels).\n\nWhen using fault tolerant (redundant architectures) systems or systems that are equipped with protection functions, detectability of failures and avoidance of common cause failures becomes paramount for safe functioning and/or mission reliability.\n\nSix Sigma has its roots in manufacturing. Reliability engineering is a specialty engineering part of systems engineering. The systems engineering process is a discovery process that is quite unlike a manufacturing process. A manufacturing process is focused on repetitive activities that achieve high quality outputs with minimum cost and time. The systems engineering process must begin by discovering a real (potential) problem that needs to be solved; the biggest failure that can be made in systems engineering is finding an elegant solution to the wrong problem (or in terms of reliability: \"providing elegant solutions to the wrong root causes of system failures\").\n\nThe everyday usage term \"quality of a product\" is loosely taken to mean its inherent degree of excellence. In industry, a more precise definition of quality as \"conformance to requirements or specifications at the start of use\" is used. Assuming the final product specification adequately captures the original requirements and customer/system needs, the quality level can be measured as the fraction of product units shipped that meet specifications.\n\nVariation of this static output may affect quality and reliability, but this is not the total picture. More inherent aspects may play a role, and in some cases, these may not be readily measured or controlled by any means. At a part level microscopic material variations such as unavoidable micro-cracks and chemical impurities may over time (due to physical or chemical \"loading\") become macroscopic defects. At a system level, systematic failures may play a dominant role (e.g. requirement errors or software or software compiler or design flaws).\n\nFurthermore, for more complex systems it should be questioned if derived or lower-level requirements and related product specifications are truly valid and correct? Will these result in premature failure due to excessive wear, fatigue, corrosion, and debris accumulation, or other issues such as maintenance induced failures? Are there any interactions at a system level (as investigated by for example Fault Tree Analysis)? How many of these systems still meet function and fulfill the needs after a week of operation? What performance losses occurred? Did full system failure occur? What happens after the end of a one-year warranty period? And what happens after 50 years (a common lifetime for aircraft, trains, nuclear systems, etc.)? That is where \"reliability\" comes in. These issues are far more complex and can not be controlled only by a standard \"quality\" (six sigma) way of working. They need a systems engineering approach.[Statement of creed, not fact.]\n\nQuality is a snapshot at the start of life and mainly related to control of lower-level product specifications. This includes time-zero defects i.e. where manufacturing mistakes escaped final Quality Control. In theory the quality level might be described by a single fraction of defective products. Reliability (as a part of systems engineering) acts as more of an ongoing account of operational capabilities, often over many years. Theoretically, all items will fail over an infinite period of time. Defects that appear over time are referred to as reliability fallout. To describe reliability fallout a probability model that describes the fraction fallout over time is needed. This is known as the life distribution model. Some of these reliability issues may be due to inherent design issues, which may exist even though the product conforms to specifications. Even items that are produced perfectly may fail over time due to one or more failure mechanisms (e.g. due to human error or mechanical, electrical, and chemical factors). These reliability issues can also be influenced by acceptable levels of variation during initial production.\n\nQuality is therefore related to manufacturing, and reliability is more related to the validation of sub-system or lower item requirements, (system or part) inherent design and life cycle solutions. Items that do not conform to (any) product specification will generally do worse in terms of reliability (having a lower MTTF), but this does not always have to be the case. The full mathematical quantification (in statistical models) of this combined relation is in general very difficult or even practically impossible. In cases where manufacturing variances can be effectively reduced, six sigma tools may be useful to find optimal process solutions which can increase reliability. Six Sigma may also help to design products that are more robust to manufacturing induced failures.\n\nIn contrast with Six Sigma, reliability engineering solutions are generally found by focusing on a (system) design and not on the manufacturing process. Solutions are found in different ways, such as by simplifying a system to allow more of the mechanisms of failure involved to be understood; performing detailed calculations of material stress levels allowing suitable safety factors to be determined; finding possible abnormal system load conditions and using this to increase robustness of a design to manufacturing variance related failure mechanisms. Furthermore, reliability engineering uses system-level solutions, like designing redundant and fault-tolerant systems for situations with high availability needs (see Reliability engineering vs Safety engineering above).\n\nSix-Sigma is also more quantified (measurement-based). The core of Six-Sigma is built on empirical research and statistical analysis (e.g. to find transfer functions) of directly measurable parameters. This can not be translated practically to most reliability issues, as reliability is not (easily) measurable due to being very much a function of time (large times may be involved), especially during the requirements-specification and design phases, where reliability engineering is the most efficient. Full quantification of reliability is in this phase extremely difficult or costly (due to the amount of testing required). It also may foster re-active management (waiting for system failures to be measured before a decision can be taken). Furthermore, as explained on this page, Reliability problems are likely to come from many different causes (e.g. inherent failures, human error, systematic failures) besides manufacturing induced defects.\n\nNote: A \"defect\" in six-sigma/quality literature is not the same as a \"failure\" (Field failure | e.g. fractured item) in reliability. A six-sigma/quality defect refers generally to non-conformance with a requirement (e.g. basic functionality or a key dimension). Items can, however, fail over time, even if these requirements are all fulfilled. Quality is generally not concerned with asking the crucial question \"are the requirements actually correct?\", whereas reliability is.\n\nWithin an entity, departments related to Quality (i.e. concerning manufacturing), Six Sigma (i.e. concerning process control), and Reliability (product design) should provide input to each other to cover the complete risks more efficiently.\n\nOnce systems or parts are being produced, reliability engineering attempts to monitor, assess, and correct deficiencies. Monitoring includes electronic and visual surveillance of critical parameters identified during the fault tree analysis design stage. Data collection is highly dependent on the nature of the system. Most large organizations have quality control groups that collect failure data on vehicles, equipment and machinery. Consumer product failures are often tracked by the number of returns. For systems in dormant storage or on standby, it is necessary to establish a formal surveillance program to inspect and test random samples. Any changes to the system, such as field upgrades or recall repairs, require additional reliability testing to ensure the reliability of the modification. Since it is not possible to anticipate all the failure modes of a given system, especially ones with a human element, failures will occur. The reliability program also includes a systematic root cause analysis that identifies the causal relationships involved in the failure such that effective corrective actions may be implemented. When possible, system failures and corrective actions are reported to the reliability engineering organization.\n\nSome of the most common methods to apply to a reliability operational assessment are failure reporting, analysis, and corrective action systems (FRACAS). This systematic approach develops a reliability, safety, and logistics assessment based on failure/incident reporting, management, analysis, and corrective/preventive actions. Organizations today are adopting this method and utilizing commercial systems (such as Web-based FRACAS applications) that enable them to create a failure/incident data repository from which statistics can be derived to view accurate and genuine reliability, safety, and quality metrics.\n\nIt is extremely important for an organization to adopt a common FRACAS system for all end items. Also, it should allow test results to be captured in a practical way. Failure to adopt one easy-to-use (in terms of ease of data-entry for field engineers and repair shop engineers) and easy-to-maintain integrated system is likely to result in a failure of the FRACAS program itself.\n\nSome of the common outputs from a FRACAS system include Field MTBF, MTTR, spares consumption, reliability growth, failure/incidents distribution by type, location, part no., serial no., and symptom.\n\nThe use of past data to predict the reliability of new comparable systems/items can be misleading as reliability is a function of the context of use and can be affected by small changes in design/manufacturing.\n\nSystems of any significant complexity are developed by organizations of people, such as a commercial company or a government agency. The reliability engineering organization must be consistent with the company's organizational structure. For small, non-critical systems, reliability engineering may be informal. As complexity grows, the need arises for a formal reliability function. Because reliability is important to the customer, the customer may even specify certain aspects of the reliability organization.\n\nThere are several common types of reliability organizations. The project manager or chief engineer may employ one or more reliability engineers directly. In larger organizations, there is usually a product assurance or specialty engineering organization, which may include reliability, maintainability, quality, safety, human factors, logistics, etc. In such case, the reliability engineer reports to the product assurance manager or specialty engineering manager.\n\nIn some cases, a company may wish to establish an independent reliability organization. This is desirable to ensure that the system reliability, which is often expensive and time-consuming, is not unduly slighted due to budget and schedule pressures. In such cases, the reliability engineer works for the project day-to-day, but is actually employed and paid by a separate organization within the company.\n\nBecause reliability engineering is critical to early system design, it has become common for reliability engineers, however, the organization is structured, to work as part of an integrated product team.\n\nSome universities offer graduate degrees in reliability engineering. Other reliability engineers typically have an engineering degree, which can be in any field of engineering, from an accredited university or college program. Many engineering programs offer reliability courses, and some universities have entire reliability engineering programs. A reliability engineer may be registered as a professional engineer by the state, but this is not required by most employers. There are many professional conferences and industry training programs available for reliability engineers. Several professional organizations exist for reliability engineers, including the American Society for Quality Reliability Division (ASQ-RD), the IEEE Reliability Society, the American Society for Quality (ASQ), and the Society of Reliability Engineers (SRE).\n\nA group of engineers have provided a list of useful tools for reliability engineering. These include: RelCalc software, Military Handbook 217 (Mil-HDBK-217), and the NAVMAT P-4855-1A manual. Analyzing failures and successes coupled with a quality standards process also provides systemized information to making informed engineering designs.\n\n\nhttp://standards.sae.org/ja1000/1_199903/ SAE JA1000/1 Reliability Program Standard Implementation Guide\n\nIn the UK, there are more up to date standards maintained under the sponsorship of UK MOD as Defence Standards.

Being run since the early 1960s mainly on the Nürburgring, it is regarded as Germany's oldest touring car racing series. Unlike in regular races for position, the event that is similar to rallying on a closed race circuit, with time challenge laps and co-drivers on board.\n\nFor many years, the series was sponsored by Castrol and \"HAUGG\" (a company owned by a race driver, providing car parts like radiators). For 2007, the sponsorship arrangements were changed, putting less emphasis on these two companies.\n\nThe event is officially styled by the FIA/DMSB as a \"Leistungsprüfung 200km\" (\"LP200\", performance test over 200 km). This means that the RCN is not a race for positions among cars that are started at once from a grid (like VLN endurance races), but a time trial, with cars being started one by one, about 5 seconds apart. This reduces the risks of collisions, as there is no benefit for a racer to defend his or her position.\n\nMost RCN events are held on the Nürburgring, mainly on the 20.832 km long \"Nordschleife\" version, on Saturday afternoon following a Gleichmäßigkeitsprüfung (GLP) run by the same organizing club. One or two additional events are held on the Grand Prix track, or on the combined tracks as used in VLN or at the 24h. Since 2003, some events were held on the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps. As season highlight in front of thousands of spectators, the RCN usually runs on the Thursday before a 24 Hours Nürburgring race, which is a holiday, either Ascension Day or Corpus Christi (feast). The track versions used during that event include various sections of the Grand Prix track. In 2005, the CHC was run on 4 different track versions, three of them at the Nürburgring.\n\nOn the Nordschleife, 15 laps of 20.832 km have to be run, for 312 km overall (longer than an F1 race). Due to being an amateur event without practise, the first (warm up) lap, the last (cool down) and two laps in between for a pit stop are not timed, unless a generous maximum time is exceeded. Of the remaining 11 laps, 9 are run at full speed (like a special stage in rallying), with each second counting as one \"penalty point\". Two laps have to be done at a given time similar to a liaison stage in rallying. If the tolerance of +/- 2 seconds is exceeded, each second counts tenfold, so some discipline and precision is required. In wet conditions, these laps can decide the winners, as they can add a significant amount of \"penalty points\" to the tally.\n\nThe entry fee is about 400 Euro. As in rallying, a co-driver can be on board, a quite unique possibility to take a passenger within a circuit racing contest. Also, those two drivers can share a drive, which reduces costs for amateurs.\n\nChampionship points are awarded according to amateur rules, depending on the number of entrants in the same class. There are also an entry level \"Light\" classes with fewer laps, focusing on regularity, and a separate championship.\n\nFor this season, no event on the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps could be arranged due to construction work there. On the other hand, the Nordschleife is used 7 times, and the GP track only once. During the 24h race weekend, parts of the GP track are connected to the 20.8 km Nordschleife for a 25.3 km track.\n\n"}

The inaugural season will be the 2015 SMP F4 Championship.\n\nGerhard Berger and the FIA Singleseater Commission launched the FIA Formula 4 in March 2013. The goal of the Formula 4 is to make the ladder to Formula One more transparent. Besides sporting and technical regulations, costs are regulated too. A car to compete in this category may not exceed €30.000 in purchase. A single season in Formula 4 may not exceed €100.000 in costs. The SMP F4 will be the one of the second phase Formula 4 championship to be launched. The first phase championships was the Italian F4 Championship and the Formula 4 Sudamericana which started in 2014. The SMP championship was launched by SMP Racing, the Russian Automobile Federation, Koiranen GP and AKK-Motorsport on 22 July 2014. Italian race car constructor Tatuus was contracted to design and build all the cars.\n\nThe championship expanded out of the FIA North European Zone for its second season. Following the failure to establish a separate Formula 4 championship in the Benelux region, it will incorporate two rounds in the Netherlands, and will award a Dutch Formula 4 Trophy for these two rounds plus a standalone Formula 4 Festival. MP Motorsport will also operate cars alongside Koiranen GP, which ran all drivers in the inaugural season.\n\nThe championship features Tatuus designed and built cars. The cars will be constructed out of carbon fibre and feature a monocoque chassis. The engine is a 1.4 turbo Abarth. This is the same engine as in the Italian F4 Championship.\n"}

As Silent Night: Opera in Two Acts the work had its world premiere at the Ordway Theater, Saint Paul, Minnesota, on November 12, 2011 under the directorship and dramaturgy of Eric Simonson. As \"Silent Night\", the opera had its East Coast premiere at the Philadelphia Academy of Music on February 8, 2013. It premiered in the Southwest at Bass Performance Hall with Fort Worth Opera on May 4, 2014. The European premiere took place on October 24, 2014, at the Wexford Festival Opera in Ireland. In 2014 the work was staged at the Calgary Opera and the Cincinnati Opera, and in 2015 it was performed at the Opéra de Montréal and the Lyric Opera of Kansas City. It received its West Coast premiere at Opera San Jose on February 11th, 2017. The Glimmerglass Festival presented the opera in 2018. It won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for Music.\n\nThe libretto is based on the multilingual screenplay by Christian Carion for the 2005 film \"Joyeux Noël\" that tells a story during the historical short-lived spontaneous 1914 Christmas truce between enemy combatants in World War I. According to characters and situations, the libretto is mostly sung in English, French and German, but also some Italian and Latin.\n\nThe opera was commissioned by Minnesota Opera as part of its New Works Initiative in co-production with Opera Philadelphia. For Kevin Puts, it was his first opera, while Mark Campbell had written librettos before.\n\nCampbell remarked that the core message of the opera is \"'War is not sustainable when you come to know your enemy as a person.' When you see that the person you might be shooting has a child or a wife or has this life at home and they’re just not the enemy, then it becomes very difficult if not impossible to sustain war.\"\n\nSummer, 1914: At a Berlin opera house the performance is disrupted by the announcement of war. The life and career of the singers Anna Sørensen and Nikolaus Sprink changes, as Nikolaus has to go to war. In Scotland, William urges his younger brother Jonathan to enlist. In Paris, pregnant Madeleine is angry as her husband Audebert departs for war.\n\nDecember 23, 1914: An attack by French and Scottish soldiers on the German line fails. Nikolaus stabs a man and despairs at the violence. William is shot and dies.\nIn the bunker later, the soldiers are shocked by the slaughter.\n\nDecember 24, 1914: In the morning, little Christmas trees are delivered to the German soldiers, a gift of the Kronprinz who is camping in a chalet nearby. Nikolaus is ordered to sing for him later and looks forward to reunite with Anna at that occasion. The French soldiers receive wine, sausages, and chocolates. The Scottish soldiers get crates of whiskey.\nLater, in the evening, Anna and Nikolaus perform for the Kronprinz. Nikolaus has to return to the front, and Anna follows him.\nAt night, a French soldier moves out with some grenades to infiltrate the German line. Some Scottish soldiers start singing. Nikolaus responds with a Christmas song (\"Silent Night\"), soon the Scottish bagpiper starts to accompany him, and Nikolaus raises a Christmas tree on the bunker. The Christmas truce starts as the lieutenants agree to stop fighting until the morning. The soldiers come out and the French soldier returns without using his grenades. The soldiers intermingle, talk, and exchange provisions. Anna appears. Father Palmer conducts a mass. Anna sings of peace. Jonathan, however, finds the body of his brother and vows to take revenge.\n\nDecember 25, 1914: In the morning Jonathan buries his brother. A decision is made to extend the truce to allow for the burial of other soldiers.\nLater in the morning Father Palmer delivers the last rites as the bodies are carried away.\nDuring the day, the news of the truce reaches the British, French, and German headquarters. It is received with disbelief, anger, and the determination to punish the soldiers.\nIn the evening Horstmayer wants to arrest Nikolaus for insubordination, but Anna takes his hand and leads him across the no-man's land toward the French side. Horstmayer's order to shoot him is ignored. Nikolaus and Anna ask the French for asylum.\n\nDecember 26, 1914: The British Major punishes the Scottish soldiers by transferring them to the front lines. On his order, Jonathan shoots a German soldier crossing the battlefield. The soldier is actually the Frenchman, Ponchel, in a German uniform who was disguised to cross the lines and visit his mother. The French General orders Audebert to Verdun and disbands his unit. The Kronprinz transfers the German soldiers to Pomerania.\nThe no-man's land is empty at the end.\n\nPuts' first opera was very well received – \"a remarkable debut\"' it was indicated that it usually takes \"a few tries to write an effective work\". Larry Fuchsberg opined that \"one senses that (Puts) has found his métier,\" admiring his ability to manage heterogeneous musical materials. Gale Martin called the work \"a contemporary opera but not necessarily a modern opera\" as it offered musicality and avoided dissonance, and thought it to be a \"work crucial to the development and appreciation of opera as a relevant modern art form\". The premiere run in 2011 was sold out.\n\nIn 2012 Kevin Puts was named the Pulitzer Prize Winner in Music for \"Silent Night: Opera in Two Acts\".\n\n"}
{"id": "34880353", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34880353", "title": "Tauros Programme", "text": "Tauros Programme\n\nThe Tauros Programme, formerly known as TaurOs Project, is a cooperation between the Dutch foundation Stichting Taurus and universities such as the Wageningen University and Research Centre. It is an international effort to breed a type of cattle that resembles the extinct aurochs, the wild ancestor of domestic cattle, to a large extent.\n\nThe project largely uses hardy cattle breeds with superficial resemblance to the extinct aurochs. By crossbreeding and selective breeding it tries to establish similarity to the aurochs. The long-term goal is to release these Tauros cattle into rewilding areas.\n\nHerbivorous megafauna are considered important tools of nature conservation in maintaining the biodiversity of open or park-like landscapes without human interference. Therefore, it is planned to reintroduce large game in several reserves to recreate the natural dynamics of the European ecosystems. The aurochs was one of the most important European ungulates but was hunted to extinction over most of Europe in the Middle Ages. Despite attempts at conservation, the last known pure-bred aurochs died in Jaktorów Forest, Poland in 1627. Thus, so-called rewilding has to work with its domesticated descendants, of which several breeds are hardy and robust enough to fill this gap. In many grazing projects, especially in Germany, Heck cattle are used, together with Galloways and Highland cattle. Heck cattle originated in the 1920s as an attempt by Lutz and Heinz Heck to breed an aurochs look-alike from several cattle breeds. Heck cattle turned out to be a hardy breed, but are found to be considerably different from the aurochs in several aspects.\n\nTaurOs Project formed to achieve a breed of cattle which is closer to the aurochs than previous breeding back attempts. This is based on the idea that original features of the aurochs are still present in some less-derived cattle breeds and can be reunited by crossbreeding and selective breeding to the largest possible degree. Stichting Taurus has been running grazing projects with hardy cattle and horses for years and bought numerous cattle breeds found to be authentic for the project from southern Europe. \n\nTaurOs Project uses very hardy cattle breeds, which should preferably resemble the aurochs to a useful extent. Crossbreeding and selective breeding with such breeds should create new lineages which are hoped to come close to the aurochs as much as possible and are fit for being released in European wild reserves. Not only the phenotype and robustness are in the focus of breeding, but also genetic information of the aurochs which might be preserved in these breeds is considered. \nThere are variations within each breed, so selection criteria are necessary to select the individuals to be included on the project. Accordingly, studies are running parallel under the umbrella of the project, e.g., to evaluate possible introgression of wild aurochs into the European cattle population. Furthermore, the food choice and behaviour of the used breeds are examined.\n\nThe breeds which are used for crossbreeding mostly stem from the Iberian Peninsula and Italy. For example, these are Sayaguesa Cattle, Pajuna Cattle, Italian Podolica and Maremmana primitivo. Although claimed to be genetically close to the aurochs, the Lidia breed (Spanish fighting bull) was not used for the project due to its aggressive behaviour.\nThese primitive breeds have decreased in numbers during the last decades, and some are highly endangered. Scottish highland cattle are used as well, because this breed has a long and dense coat and is very hardy. Several cross individuals have been born already.\n\nMembers of the project hope that the Tauros cattle will one day be able to move freely in wild herds in European nature areas just as red deer, wild boar, and wolves do.\n\nMeanwhile, the genetic relationship between a number of cattle breeds and the aurochs is examined.\n\nFollowing robust cattle breeds are presently used:\n\n\nAll breeds except Boškarin are being used for breeding in the Dutch herds. Outside of the Netherlands, mainly Sayaguesa, Maremmana, Maronesa and Boškarin are being used as founding breeds, supplemented by crossbreeds from the Dutch sites. By the end of 2015, over 150 animals of the founding breeds have been used in breeding, and almost 300 cross animals have been born, among them 17 animals already of the fourth cross-generation.\n\n\n"}

Matloff wrote: \"But the reporters and photographers stationed in South Africa at the time were also compassionate human beings who exposed themselves to danger because they wanted to record history. This doesn't particularly come through in the film. Instead, Silver plays to the Hollywood stereotype of journalists as heartless outsiders.

She said of her experiences, \"The film depicts the photographers as reckless thrill-seekers, swaggering into newsrooms like rock stars and canoodling with babes, when not jumping into cars to chase 'Bang Bang' (violence)\". In her review Matloff said that Marinovich had disassociated himself from the film version. \"It has the same title but it is not the same story. It's not my life.

João Silva was asked in an interview for the French magazine \"Paris Match\" about the film. His answer described Michel Peyrard with the words:\n\n\"The Bang Bang Club\" received mixed reviews.
