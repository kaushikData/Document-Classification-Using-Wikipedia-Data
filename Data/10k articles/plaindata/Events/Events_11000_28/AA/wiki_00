The blaze began in a room on the top floor, apparently caused by an unattended cigarette. \n\nAs a result of the fire and ensuing rush to escape, 15 young girls died, and more than 50 were injured. Nine of the dead girls were Saudis; the rest were from Chad, Egypt, Guinea, Niger, and Nigeria. The majority of the deaths occurred when a staircase collapsed as the girls fled the building. The residential property upon which the school was built was overcrowded with 800 pupils. In addition, the building may have lacked proper safety infrastructure and equipment, such as fire stairs and alarms.\n\nAccording to at least two reports, members of the CPVPV, also known as \"Mutaween\", would not allow the girls to escape or to be saved from the fire because they were \"not properly covered\", and the mutaween did not want physical contact to take place between the girls and the civil defense forces for fear of sexual enticement, and variously that the girls were locked in by the police, or forced back into the building. According to Hanny Megally, Executive Director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch, \"women and girls may have died unnecessarily because of extreme interpretations of the Islamic dress code.\nCivil Defense stated that the fire had extinguished itself before they arrived on the scene. CPVPV officers did appear to object to Civil Defense workers going into the building—Human Rights Watch quoted a Civil Defense officer as saying,\n\"Whenever the girls got out through the main gate, these people forced them to return via another. Instead of extending a helping hand for the rescue work, they were using their hands to beat us.\"\nThe CPVPV denied the charges of beating or locking the gates but the incident and the accounts of witnesses were reported in Saudi newspapers such as the \"Saudi Gazette\" and \"Al-Iqtisaddiyya\". The result was a very rare public criticism of the group.\n\nAlso criticized was the General Presidency for Girls' Education (GPGE), which administers girl's schools in Saudi Arabia\".\n\nAn inquiry was launched by the Saudi government in wake of the deaths. The investigation was led by Abdul Majeed, the governor of Mecca. The Interior Minister, Prince Nayef, promised that those responsible for the deaths would be held accountable. Nayef, at the time, stated that the deaths did not happen as a result of the fire, but rather the stampede caused by the panic. He acknowledged the presence of two mutaween and that they went there to prevent \"mistreatment\" of the girls. He said that they did not interfere with the rescue efforts and only arrived after everyone had left the building.\n\nOn March 25, the inquiry concluded that while the fire had been caused by a stray cigarette, the religious educational authorities responsible for the school had neglected the safety of the pupils. The inquiry found that the clerics had ignored warnings that overcrowding of the school could cause a fatal stampede. It also found that there was a lack of fire extinguishers and alarms in the building. Accordingly, the cleric in charge of the school was fired, and his office was merged with the Ministry of Education. The report dismissed allegations that the mutaween (of CPVPV) had prevented the girls from fleeing or made the death toll worse.\n\nMany newspapers welcomed the merger of the agency responsible for girls' education with the Ministry of Education. Previously, the agencies had been separate and girls' education had been in the hands of the religious establishment. The newspapers saw the merger as a step towards \"reform\".\n\nIn the outrage over the deaths that followed, Crown Prince Abdullah removed girls' schools from the administration of the \"General Presidency for Girls' Education\"—an \"autonomous government agency long controlled by conservative clerics\"—and put it under the Ministry of Education, which already controlled boys' schools. In 1960, when girls' schools were first created in Saudi Arabia, they were put under the control of a separate administration dominated by conservatives as \"a compromise to calm public opposition to allowing (not requiring) girls to attend school\".\n\nThere was another similar incident in 2014; a female student at a Saudi university died after being denied access to advanced medical assistance because the paramedics were male. Senior members of the faculty prevented the paramedics from entering primarily because the student was not fully covered and they did not want to get into trouble for having men in close proximity to her. This caused many Saudis to vent their anger and question the University's policies. \n\n\n"}

For the duration of three weeks, the Architect Africa Film Festival travels to Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth where up to 25 international and local films featuring the built environment are screened to the public at central cinema complexes. This becomes the core event around which many additional activities take place, including two student competitions – the Tripod Architecture Photography Competition and the Moving Spaces Film Competition.\n\nThe Architect Africa Film Festival screens films about built environments or urban landscapes or anything to do with modern city life. The films vary in length from short films to feature length. The films can be documentaries or fictional narratives. All of the films have something to say about cities and architecture and are sourced from all over the world.\n\nSome of the films screened at previous festivals include: The Fountainhead, Metropolis, City of God, The Belly of an Architect, The 11th Hour, My Architect, The Garden, and Marina of the Zabbaleen. Many of the films are award-winning and inspire the many people who attend the festival.\n\nIn 2006 the AAC formulated a plan for the creation of a registered integral collective which would be representative and controlled by the Architectural Profession in South Africa and charged with the organisational and administrative functions required to host a premier national event.\n\nA formal non-profit organisation was registered in 2007 under the name of Architects Collective of South Africa (Reg.No. 2007/007763/08). The first Festival with associated exhibitions was held in September 2007 in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban.\n\nFrom the outset the Festival received the committed support of the South African Council for the Architectural Profession, the South African Institute of Architects and a number of architectural practices and organisations. This has ensured its success and growth. The Architect Africa Film Festival is held over three weeks in Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth, usually between the months of September and October.\n\nThe first Architect Africa Film Festival (2007) was held, and acclaimed, in South Africa’s three major centres in August and September 2007. The success of the first Festival, and the generous support of sponsors, enabled the Festival 2008 to take place in five cities – Johannesburg, Durban, Cape Town, Bloemfontein and Port Elizabeth – making it a truly national event.\n\nIn September 2009, the Architects’ Collective was invited to host Architect Africa Film Screenings at the Architecture Student Congress/African Perspectives Conference at the University of Pretoria. The event was used to launch the winning films from the Moving Spaces Student Film Competition.\n\nAs a result of this collaboration, the Collective was approached to host smaller events on behalf of the regional institutes of architecture. In October 2009, Architect Africa Film Screenings were held at the 50th Anniversary Celebration of the John Moffat building, School of Architecture & Planning, at the University of the Witwatersrand.\n\n2010 saw the Architects' Collective host their third and biggest film festival yet. Screenings were hosted again in the five major cities and included the first major public screenings of the Moving Space student films from 2009 and 2010. Alongside the film screenings the best photographs from the Tripod Photography competition were exhibited.\n\nIn addition, during the Johannesburg leg the Architects' Collective hosted a special screening at the Bus Factory as part of the AZA2010 festival. The Architects’ Collective continues to grow its recognition as a major player in the architecture and film festival communities.\n\n"}

{"id": "871253", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=871253", "title": "Big year", "text": "Big year\n\nA big year is a personal challenge or an informal competition among birders who attempt to identify as many species as possible by sight or sound, within a single calendar year and within a specific geographic area. Popularized in North America, big years are commonly done within single US states and Canadian provinces, as well as within larger areas such as the entire world, the lower 48 continental U.S. states, or within the official American Birding Association Area. The ABA big year record of 836 species was set by John Weigel of Australia in 2016. The world big year record of 6,833 species was set in 2016 by Arjan Dwarshuis of the Netherlands.\n\nThe wide publication in 1934 of the first modern field guide by Roger Tory Peterson truly revolutionized birding. However, in that era, most birders did not travel widely. The earliest known continent wide Big Year record was compiled by Guy Emerson, a traveling businessman, who timed his business trips to coincide with the best birding seasons for different areas in North America. During his best year, in 1939, he saw 497 species. In 1952, Emerson's record was broken by Bob Smart, who saw 515 species.\n\nIn 1953, Roger Tory Peterson and James Fisher took a 30,000 mile road trip visiting the wild places of North America. In 1955, they told the story of their travels in a book and a documentary film, both called \"Wild America\". In a footnote to the book, Peterson claimed \"My year's list at the end of 1953 was 572 species.\" In 1956, a 25-year-old Englishman named Stuart Keith, following Peterson and Fisher's route, compiled a list of 594 species, a record that stood for fifteen years.\n\nIn 1971, 18-year-old Ted Parker, in his last semester of high school in southeastern Pennsylvania, extensively birded the eastern seaboard of North America. That September, Parker enrolled in the University of Arizona in Tucson and found dozens of Southwestern U.S. and Pacific coast specialties, ending the year with a list of 626 species.\n\nThe 1969 foundation of the American Birding Association standardized and regulated North American Big Years. The ABA Area was defined as the 49 continental U.S. states (excluding Hawaii), Canada, and the French islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, plus adjacent waters to a distance of 200 miles from land or half the distance to a neighboring country, whichever distance is less.\n\nBig year efforts were still few and far between. In 1973 Kenn Kaufman and Floyd Murdoch both pursued Parker's record. As recounted in Kaufman's book \"Kingbird Highway\", both broke the old record by a wide margin. Murdoch finished with 669 in the newly described ABA area to Kaufman's 666. Murdoch's record was broken in 1979 by James M. Vardaman, who saw 699 species that year and travelled 161,332 miles. Benton Basham, in 1983, topped Vardaman's effort with 710 species. 1987 marked the second time that there was a competition during a single year, with Sandy Komito's 722 species topping Steve Perry's 711. In 1992 Bill Rydell made a serious attempt at the record and ended with 714 species for the year.\n\nIn 1998, three birders, Sandy Komito, Al Levantin, and Greg Miller, chased Komito's prior record of 722 birds. In the end Komito kept the record, listing 745 species birds plus 3 submitted in 1998 and later accepted by state committees for a revised total of 748. Mark Obmascik's book about the 1998 big year birders was adapted into the 2011 20th Century Fox film \"The Big Year\".\n\nIn 2008, Lynn Barber, the Texas big year record holder, became the first woman to break the 700-species barrier with a total of 723. In 2010, North Carolina birder Chris Hitt became the first birder to see 700+ species in the lower 48 in a single year, finishing with 704. In the same year, Virginia birder Robert Ake ended the year with 731 species, an extraordinary total achieved without the benefit of the relatively unique weather effects of 1998.\n\nIn 2011, Colorado birder John Vanderpoel became the fastest birder on record to reach 700 species in a year. However, ultimately John only managed 743 birds, missing out on the record by two (or five, with Komito's revised total). Vanderpoel's effort was the last made without the major contribution of eBird and birding groups on Facebook, which significantly enhanced the quality and quantity of rare bird alerts. \n\nIn 2013, Massachusetts birder Neil Hayward reluctantly decided to do an ABA big year. Neil reached 700 species two weeks ahead of John Vanderpoel's 2011 pace, and ended his year on 747 species plus 3 provisionals. Two provisionals later accepted by the ABA gave Hayward a final total of 749, which set a new ABA Big Year record.\n\nIn 2016, an unprecedented four birders attempted simultaneous ABA Area big years. A South Dakotan doctor birding as \"Olaf Danielson\" launched his \"Bad Weather Big Year\", reaching 700 species in May. John Weigel, an Australian conservationist and Tasmanian devil activist, also launched his big year, called \"Birding for Devils.\" While not seeking to break the record, American birding activist and blogger Christian Hagenlocher's \"The Birding Project\" aimed to attract more people to birding through a more social perspective. Hagenlocher, at age 27, also became the youngest person to break the 700-species barrier for an ABA big year. Photographer Laura Keene, conducting a 2016 photographic big year, broke Lynn Barber's Big Year record for women in September. 2016 marked the first time four birders had each seen over 700 species in the ABA Area in a year. On 16 July 2016, Weigel saw his 750th species, a Buller's shearwater, breaking Hayward's previous record. All four birders would eventually surpass Hayward's total.\n\nIn October 2016, the ABA voted to add the U.S. state of Hawaii to the countable area for ABA Big Years. All the 2016 big year birders except Hagenlocher birded Hawaii during November and December 2016, even though the \"New\" ABA checklist was not updated until November 2017. Olaf Danielson, partly due to efforts to promote bird conservation in Hawaii, incorporated Hawaii into his Big Year planning, keeping a list for the \"New ABA\" along with his Continental ABA list. John Weigel and Laura Keene subsequently birded Hawaii, with Weigel ending up with the highest total for the \"New ABA\" region (836), the Continental ABA region (784) and the United States (832). Danielson was close behind with 829 for the \"New ABA,\" while setting a new record for the Lower 48 States (723). Weigel was nipping at his heels with 721. Keene shattered the previous record for photographed species with diagnostic photos of 792 species, and audio recordings of 10 others, out of her 815 total for the year. \n\n2017 broke new ground, with five birders surpassing 700 species in the Continental ABA Area by September, and three breaking the 750-species barrier. Keene's women's record for the \"New ABA\" region was broken in 2017 by Yve Morrell.\n\nIn 2018, Nicole Koeltzow reached the 700-species milestone on July 1st, while in August Gaylee and Richard Dean became the first birders to reach 700 species in consecutive years. On October 30, 2018, in Hawaii, Koeltzow became the 7th birder to reach the 800-species mark.\n\nThe provisional species for 2018 is House Crow.\n\nThe provisional species for 2018 is House Crow.\n\nThe provisional species for 2018 is House Crow.\n\nIn 2008, British couple Alan Davies and Ruth Miller traveled around the world, seeing 4341 species. In 2015, Oregon birder Noah Strycker launched a worldwide big year with the goal of seeing at least 5,000 species—roughly half of the world's species—as he traveled around the globe. On September 16, in India, he broke the existing record of 4,341 species, set in 2008 by Alan Davies and Ruth Miller, when he saw a Sri Lanka frogmouth for his 4,342nd species of the year. He finished the year with 6,042 bird species, his last species seen being an Oriental Bay Owl in Assam, India. Strycker's record faced an immediate challenge in 2016 when Dutch birder Arjan Dwarshuis launched an effort to break it as well as raise money for the Birdlife Preventing Extinctions Programme. On November 4, 2016, Dwarshuis saw a tody motmot in Panama, breaking Strycker's previous record total. He finished the year with 6833 seen bird species and this is the new World big year record.\n\nBecause Dwarshuis primarily used the IOC Checklist and Strycker the Clements Checklist, their totals are not fully compatible, as the IOC checklist lists a greater number of species. However, Dwarshuis and Strycker have both compiled checklists for each list.\n\nMany world big year birders aim to minimize costs through a sponsorship, and their carbon footprint through a carbon offset program.\n\nTraditional big year birders have drawn criticism from environmentalists for failing to consider the ecological impact of their travel. Several birders have attempted \"green\", or alternative big years to raise awareness for both birding and the environment. \nIn 2005, two British cycling birders decided to have a competition. Chris Mills in Norfolk, England and Simon Woolley, Hampshire, England competed over who would see the most birds by cycling only and hence become the UK Green Year list record holder. Chris Mills won setting a record of 251 bird species.\n\nStarting in the summer of 2007, teenager Malkolm Boothroyd and his parents, Ken Madsen and Wendy Boothroyd, attempted a big year without the use of fossil fuels by planning to bicycle over 10,000 miles to get over 400 species for the year. They started in their home province of the Yukon Territory, rode down the Pacific Coast, looping back around Arkansas to catch the Texas spring migration, then eastward to Florida. They dubbed this attempt a \"bird year,\" rather than a big year. In the end, they covered more than 13,000 miles by bicycle and tallied 548 species, raising more than $25,000 for bird conservation in the process.\n\n2014 saw the first continent-wide \"green year\", a big year executed with a minimum of environmental impact. In his rather extreme instance, Dorian Anderson bicycled 17,830 miles around the United States, amassing a self-powered, petroleum-free 618 species during his 365 days on America's roads. Dorian visited 28 states (some twice) during his adventure and, beyond his species total, raised $49,000 for habitat conservation. He shunned all motorized transportation for the entire adventure, refusing even ferries that would have saved him sometimes hundreds of miles of riding around various bodies of water. Once hit by a car and many times nearly missed, it was a minor miracle that he survived the entire year without major injury.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24565032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24565032", "title": "Boardwalk Empire", "text": "Boardwalk Empire\n\nBoardwalk Empire is an American period crime drama television series created by Terence Winter and broadcast on premium cable channel HBO. The series is set in Atlantic City, New Jersey, during the Prohibition era and stars Steve Buscemi as Nucky Thompson. Winter, a Primetime Emmy Award-winning screenwriter and producer, created the show, inspired by the book \"Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City\" by Nelson Johnson about historical criminal kingpin Enoch L. Johnson.\n\nThe pilot episode was directed by Martin Scorsese and produced at a cost of $18 million. On September 1, 2009, HBO picked up the series for an additional 11 episodes. The series premiered on September 19, 2010, and completed its five-season run on October 26, 2014.\n\n\"Boardwalk Empire\" received widespread critical acclaim, particularly for its visual style and basis on historical figures, as well as for Buscemi's lead performance. The series received 57 Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including two for Outstanding Drama Series, winning 20. The series also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama in 2011 and two Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2011 and 2012.\n\n\"Boardwalk Empire\" is a period drama focusing on Enoch \"Nucky\" Thompson (based on the historical Enoch L. Johnson), a political figure who rises to prominence and controls Atlantic City, New Jersey, during the Prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s. Nucky interacts with historical characters in both his personal and political life, including mobsters, politicians, government agents, and the common folk who look up to him. The federal government also takes an interest in the bootlegging and other illegal activities in the area, sending agents to investigate possible mob connections but also looking at Nucky's lifestyle—expensive and lavish for a county political figure. The final season jumps ahead seven years, to 1931, as Prohibition nears its end.\n\n\nEmmy Award-winner Terence Winter, who served as executive producer and writer on the HBO series \"The Sopranos\", was hired on June 4, 2008 to adapt the non-fiction book \"Boardwalk Empire: The Birth, High Times, and Corruption of Atlantic City\". Winter had already been interested in creating a series set in the 1920s, feeling that it had never properly been explored before. For this reason he decided to focus his adaptation of the book on the section about Prohibition. On September 1, 2009, it was announced that Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese would direct the pilot. It would be the first time he had directed an episode of television since an episode of Steven Spielberg's \"Amazing Stories\" in 1986. The production would be very ambitious, with some even speculating it would be too large scale for television. \"I kept thinking, 'This is pointless. How can we possibly afford a boardwalk, or an empire? says creator Terence Winter. \"We can't call it 'Boardwalk Empire' and not see a boardwalk.\" The production would eventually build a boardwalk in an empty lot in Brooklyn, New York, at the cost of $5 million. Despite a reported budget of up to $50 million, the pilot's final budget came in at $18 million.\n\nOn why he chose to return to television, Scorsese said \"What's happening the past nine to 10 years, particularly at HBO, is what we had hoped for in the mid-'60s with films being made for television at first. We'd hoped there would be this kind of freedom and also the ability to create another world and create long-form characters and story. That didn't happen in the 1970s, 1980s and in the 1990s I think. And of course...HBO is a trailblazer in this. I've been tempted over the years to be involved with them because of the nature of long-form and their development of character and plot.\" He went on to praise HBO by saying, \"A number of the episodes, in so many of their series, they're thoughtful, intelligent [and] brilliantly put together...It's a new opportunity for storytelling. It's very different from television of the past.\"\n\n\"Scorsese is an actor magnet,\" commented Winter. \"Everybody wants to work with him. I had all these pictures on my wall and I thought, 'I'd really better write some good stuff for these people. In casting the role of Nucky Thompson (based upon real-life Atlantic City political boss Enoch L. Johnson), Winter wanted to stray from the real life Johnson as much as possible. \"If we were going to cast accurately what the real Nucky looked like, we'd have cast Jim Gandolfini.\" The idea of casting Steve Buscemi in the lead role came about when Scorsese mentioned wanting to work with the actor, whom Winter knew well having worked with him on \"The Sopranos\". Winter sent the script out to Buscemi, who responded very enthusiastically. \"I just thought, 'Wow. I'm almost sorry I've read this, because if I don't get it, I'm going to be so sad.' My response was 'Terry, I know you're looking at other actors'... and he said, 'No, no, Steve, I said we want you. Explained Scorsese, \"I love the range he has, his dramatic sense, but also his sense of humor.\"\n\nThe casting of Buscemi was soon followed by Michael Pitt, best known for his roles in films such as \"Murder by Numbers\", \"The Dreamers\", and in the television series \"Dawson's Creek\". He was soon joined by Kelly Macdonald, Vincent Piazza and Michael Shannon, who had just received an Oscar nomination for his role in the Sam Mendes film \"Revolutionary Road\".\n\nFilming for the pilot took place at various locations in and around New York City in June 2009. In creating the visual effects for the series, the company turned to Brooklyn-based effects company Brainstorm Digital. Says Glenn Allen, visual effects producer for \"Boardwalk Empire\" and co-founder of Brainstorm, \"It's our most complex job to date. Everything is HD now, so we have to treat it like a feature film.\" \"Anytime you get to work on a period piece, it's more fun,\" comments visual effects artist Chris \"Pinkus\" Wesselman, who used archival photographs, postcards, and architectural plans to recreate the Atlantic City boardwalks as accurately as possible. \"We got to explore what the old Atlantic City was really like. The piers were one of the toughest parts because every summer they would change—new houses, new advertisements.\" It took two months for the firm to complete all the visual effects for the pilot. \"Boardwalk Empire\" began filming on location at Historic Richmond Town on Staten Island in March 2012.\n\nDesigned by John Dunn and tailored by Martin Greenfield, \"Boardwalk Empire's\" costumes were based on 1920s tailoring books from the Fashion Institute of Technology's research libraries and examples found at the Brooklyn Museum and the Met. The costumes have also been rented from the Daybreak Vintage Company located in Albany, NY which also exhibits at the Manhattan Vintage Clothing Show. Dunn's designs were meticulously detailed, including a collar pin for Nucky's shirts and even going so far as to incorporate specially ordered woolens for suiting. Dunn told \"Esquire\" magazine in a September 2010 interview, \"With Marty and Terry Winters, I developed the feel for each of the characters. We all wanted it to be very, very accurate and specific to the period... I don't like to do boring clothing, but you also have to make sure that you're not suddenly putting somebody in something that isn't going to make sense four episodes from now.\"\nThese tailors were supplied by textile importer HMS fabrics and Gladson ltd.\n\nMartin Scorsese was involved in the filming even before creator Terence Winter. He directed the pilot and established the look of the show, which other directors later emulated for consistency. He is also one of the executive producers of the show. Winter has stated that Scorsese weighed in on the casting decisions and reviewed all of the cuts and dailies. Up until the shooting of the show's first season, Scorsese and Winter would meet every Sunday afternoon to review what went on during the week where Scorsese would have comments and suggestions. Scorsese continued to be creatively involved in the ongoing production, but did not direct any more episodes.\n\nScorsese and Winter were joined as executive producers by Mark Wahlberg, Stephen Levinson and Tim Van Patten. Van Patten had been a regular director on \"The Sopranos\" and also served as a regular director for \"Boardwalk Empire\". Lawrence Konner was a co-executive producer. Konner also wrote for the show and had previously been a writer on \"The Sopranos\". Howard Korder and Margaret Nagle served as supervising producers and writers for the first season. The crew were recognized with multiple Primetime Emmy Award nominations for their work on the first season. Korder returned as a co-executive producer and writer for the show's second season and as an executive producer in the third season.\n\nThe music used for the opening titles is \"Straight Up and Down\" by The Brian Jonestown Massacre. It was chosen by series creator Winter to create a sense of the \"unexpected.\"\n\nThe soundtrack is composed of music from the 1890s to 1920s performed by artists such as Regina Spektor, Leon Redbone, Loudon Wainwright III, Martha Wainwright, Catherine Russell, Nellie McKay, Kathy Brier, and Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks Orchestra. \"\", featuring music from seasons 1 and 2, was released on September 13, 2011.\n\nThe soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media at the 54th Grammy Awards.\n\nTo promote the second season, which started on September 25, 2011, the producers paid the Metropolitan Transportation Authority $150,000 to decorate and operate a New York Transit Museum train of four retired New York City Subway Lo-V cars for each weekend in September 2011. The subway cars used were 5290, 5292 (both built in 1917), 5443, 5483 (both built in 1924). The train operated between noon and 6 p.m. and as an express between 96th Street and Times Square–42nd Street Subway on the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line. While the MTA runs \"nostalgia trains\" each year, this was the first time they had been used for an advertising tie-in.\n\nHBO also sponsored an Atlantic City beautification project with the tag line \"Compliments of Nucky Thompson\" and paid for eastbound tolls into Atlantic City on the AC Expressway for the weekend of September 24, 2011.\n\n\"Boardwalk Empire\" has received critical acclaim. For its first and second seasons, The American Film Institute named \"Boardwalk Empire\" one of the ten \"best television programs of the year.\"\n\nOn the review aggregator website Metacritic, the first season scored 88 out of 100, and the second season scored 81 out of 100, both indicating \"universal acclaim.\" The third season scored 76 of 100, and the fourth season scored 77 out of 100, both indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" In the show's fifth and final season, it scored 83 out of 100.\n\nOn another review aggregator site, Rotten Tomatoes, the first season received a rating of 93%. Season two received an 88%, the third season an 87% and the fourth season a 97%, stating \"\"Boardwalk Empire\" continues to benefit from its meticulously realized period trappings, but what keeps the show watchable is its supremely talented ensemble players\". The fifth season of the show holds a rating of 90%, with the site's consensus reading: \"The final season of \"Boardwalk Empire\" is as visually dazzling and well-acted as ever, but it's the emphasis on Nucky Thompson's history that's particularly rewarding this time out.\"\n\nDavid Hinkley of the \"New York Daily News\" awarded the series five stars, saying, \"Watching HBO's new 'Boardwalk Empire' is like sitting in your favorite tavern and hearing someone say, 'Drinks are on the house.' Friends, it does not get much better.\" Paige Wiser of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" called it \"... an event not to be missed,\" and praised Buscemi in particular, calling his performance \"fascinating.\"\n\n\"TV Guide\"'s Matt Roush praised the partnership of Scorsese and Winter, saying it \"... brilliantly marries Martin Scorsese's virtuosic cinematic eye to Terence Winter's panoramic mastery of rich character and eventful story,\" and finished his review by stating, \"It's the most purely—and impurely—enjoyable storytelling HBO has delivered in ages, like a movie that you never want to end.\"\n\n\"Variety\"'s Brian Lowry praised the show for returning network HBO to top form, saying, \"This is, quite simply, television at its finest, occupying a sweet spot that—for all the able competition—still remains unique to HBO: An expensive, explicit, character-driven program, tackling material no broadcast network or movie studio would dare touch ... For those wondering when the channel would deliver another franchise to definitively put it on top of the world, Ma, the wait is over: Go directly to \"Boardwalk\".\"\n\n\"One of the unexpected joys of \"Boardwalk Empire\", though, lies in the way the show revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a giddy shadow world of criminals and politicians collaborating to keep the liquor flowing,\" says online magazine \"Salon's\" Heather Havrilesky, who went on to call the pilot \"breathtaking.\" Roberto Bianco from \"USA Today\" said in his review that \"Boardwalk Empire\" was \"Extravagantly produced, shockingly violent and as cold and hard as ice, \"Boardwalk Empire\" brings us back to the world's former playground at the start of Prohibition—and brings HBO back to the forefront of the TV-series race.\"\n\nThe second season received widespread acclaim. Verne Gay from \"Newsday\" stated that \"\"Mad Men\", of course, remains the King of the Emmys, while \"Empire\" nailed the equally prestigious Golden Globe for best drama last winter. But Sunday begins to build the case for \"Empire\", and build it convincingly.\" Matt Roush of \"TV Guide\" stated, \"This is a gorgeous piece of storytelling that requires and rewards patience.\" Brian Lowry stated in his review for \"Variety\" that: \"A few creative flourishes feel a trifle heavy-handed – starting with Shannon's philandering fed. Unlike Nucky, though, \"Boardwalk\" isn't campaigning for anything except the gratitude of a pay-cable audience (and award voters) eager to take refuge in its sordid charms. By that measure, the show doesn't just go down smoothly; it's good to the last illicit, intoxicating drop.\"\n\nNancy Franklin of \"The New Yorker\" considered Buscemi miscast as the central figure in the drama. \"Buscemi can’t play that kind of character; even at the age of fifty-two, he looks cagey and restless—not like a guy at the top but like the guy who gets killed when he tries to knock off the guy at the top.\" The review concludes \"\"Boardwalk Empire\"” is at great pains to give viewers a sense that they are there, and yet rarely did I feel engrossed in the show. Even if its point is to show you the ugly side of fun, \"Boardwalk Empire\" should be much more fun to watch.\"\n\nAlessandra Stanley of \"The New York Times\" review states that \"surprisingly, given the extraordinary talent and money behind it, \"Boardwalk Empire\" falls short. One possible reason is that the star, Steve Buscemi, is hard to accept in the lead role of Enoch Thompson,\" going on to observe \"it takes a lot of squinting to see him as a powerbroker straddling two worlds.\"\n\nOn July 14, 2011, for the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards, \"Boardwalk Empire\" was nominated for 18 Primetime Emmy Awards for the first season that included Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Steve Buscemi), and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Kelly Macdonald), with Martin Scorsese winning Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series, along with seven other wins at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards. \"Boardwalk Empire\" won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best New Series and was nominated for Best Dramatic Series. In addition, the show won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama and Steve Buscemi won Best Actor – Television Series Drama, while Kelly Macdonald was nominated for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. The cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2011 and 2012, while Steve Buscemi won for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series as well in 2011 and 2012, for the first and second season. In 2011, Martin Scorsese won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Drama Series for the pilot. \"Boardwalk Empire\" was also listed in the American Film Institute's Top Ten List for Television in 2010 and 2011 for the first and second season.\n\n\"Boardwalk Empire\" also won two awards at the 9th Annual Visual Effects Society Awards. The first for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Broadcast Program and second for Outstanding Models & Miniatures in a Broadcast Program or Commercial. The former was received by Richard Friedlander (of Brainstorm Digital), Robert Stromberg, Paul Graff and David Taritero; the latter was received by Brendan Fitzgerald, John Corbett and Matthew Conner of Brainstorm Digital. The show's Season One Soundtrack won the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media in 2012.\n\nFor the second season, \"Boardwalk Empire\" won once again for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for Tim Van Patten for the season finale \"To the Lost\", along with three other wins at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards.\n\nFor the third season, Bobby Cannavale won the show's first acting award at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his portrayal of Gyp Rosetti, along with four other wins at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards.\n\nOn its original airing, the pilot episode gained a 2.0/5 ratings share among adults aged 18–49 and garnered 4.81 million viewers. The episode was re-played twice that night, once at 10:15 p.m. and again at 11:30 p.m. Taking these broadcasts into account, a total of 7.1 million Americans viewed the episode on the night of its original broadcast, and is the highest rated premiere for an HBO series since the pilot of \"Deadwood\" in March 2004. The season finale was watched by 3.29 million viewers, attaining a 1.3 rating adults aged 18–49.\n\nThe second-season premiere was watched by 2.91 million viewers, down 39% from the pilot and down 12% from its first-season finale.\n"}
{"id": "53657539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53657539", "title": "Brexit negotiations", "text": "Brexit negotiations\n\nThe Brexit negotiations are taking place between the United Kingdom and the European Union for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union following the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum in June 2016. The negotiating period began on 29 March 2017 when the United Kingdom served the withdrawal notice under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. The period for negotiation stated in Article 50 is two years from notification, unless an extension is agreed.\n\nOn 19 June 2017, the British Brexit Secretary, David Davis, arrived in Brussels to begin the process with Michel Barnier, the Chief Negotiator appointed by the European Commission.\n\nNegotiations on the withdrawal agreement (which includes a transitional period and an outline of the objectives for a future relationship between the UK and the EU) have now been concluded, with the European Union indicating that no further negotiation or changes before the UK legally leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 will be possible.\n\nIf the withdrawal agreement is ratified by the UK and other EU state governments and comes into force, future negotiation might also need to address Free Trade Agreement treaties between the European Union and its members (including the UK) for one part and third countries for the other part, and the tariff-rate quota, which might be split or renegotiated.\n\nIn the Conservative Party's manifesto for the United Kingdom General Election in May 2015, an EU referendum was promised by the end of 2017.\n\nAccording to the European parliament, \"For the moment, it appears that the two sides have different views on the sequencing and scope of the negotiations, and notably the cross-over between the withdrawal agreement and the structure of future relations, and this divergence itself may be one of the first major challenges to overcome.\"\n\n\nThe Department for Exiting the European Union is responsible for overseeing the negotiations to leave the EU and for establishing the future relationship between the UK and EU.\n\nThe United Kingdom's proposed principles were set out in the Article 50 notification:\n\nThe Prime Minister's formal letter of notification was delivered in Brussels on 29 March 2017. It included withdrawal from the European Atomic Energy Community. The letter recognized that consequences for the UK of leaving the EU included loss of influence over the rules that affect the European economy, and UK companies trading within the EU aligning with rules agreed by institutions of which the UK would no longer be part. It proposed agreeing to seven principles for the conduct of the withdrawal negotiation. These are for:\n\nThe constitutional lawyer and retired German Supreme Court judge Udo Di Fabio has stated his opinion that separate negotiations with the EU institutions by Scotland or Northern Ireland would constitute a violation of the Lisbon Treaty, according to which the integrity of a member country is explicitly put under protection.\n\nThe start of negotiations was delayed until after the United Kingdom general election, which took place on 8 June 2017. Antonio Tajani, speaking on 20 April said that the early election should bring stability to the UK, which would have been good for negotiations. In the event, the election led to a hung parliament which has reduced the Prime Minister's room for manoeuvre; in particular in respect of the Irish border question due to her dependency on a confidence and supply agreement with Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.\n\n\nFollowing the United Kingdom's notification under Article 50, draft guidelines for the negotiations were sent to EU delegations of the 27 other member states (the EU27). The draft, prepared by the President of the European Council, states that the guidelines define the framework for negotiations under Article 50 and set out the overall positions and principles that the Union will pursue throughout the negotiation. It states that in the negotiations the Union's overall objective will be to preserve its interests, those of its Member States, its citizens and its businesses, and that, in the best interest of both sides, the Union will be constructive throughout and strive to find an agreement. The draft sets out two Core Principles:\n\nAccording to the European Parliament, the withdrawal agreement and any possible transitional arrangement(s) should enter into force \"well before the elections to the European Parliament of May 2019\", and the negotiations should focus on:\n\nOn 18 April 2017, a spokesman for Donald Tusk said \"We expect to have the Brexit guidelines adopted by the European Council on 29 April and, following that, the Brexit negotiating directives ready on 22 May\". On 29 April the EU27 unanimously endorsed the draft guidelines with no debate.\n\nIn a speech to a plenary session of the European Committee of the Regions in Brussels on 22 March 2017, Barnier, as EU Chief Negotiator for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations, said that the EU wanted to succeed by reaching a deal with the British, not against them.\n\nOn 22 May the European Commission Council, following the approval of negotiating directives which had been adopted by strong qualified majority (72% of the 27 Member States, i.e. 20 Member States representing 65% of the population of the EU27), authorised the opening of Article 50 discussions with the Commission appointed as the negotiator. It further confirmed that all agendas, EU position papers, Non-papers and EU text proposals will be released to the public and published on line.\n\nIntergovernmental organizations also involved in Brexit uncertainty considerations include the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International Air Transport Association (IATA). IATA expects an agreement to avoid disruption.\n\nEU27 guidelines include:\nwithin the withdrawal phase.\n\nThe second phase, covering the post-Brexit relationship between the EU27 and the UK, will begin \"as soon as the European Council decides that sufficient progress has been made in the first phase towards reaching a satisfactory agreement on the arrangements for an orderly withdrawal\". The earliest opportunity for this decision was 19 October 2017, at a summit of EU leaders. although at that meeting it was agreed to start negotiations during the December meeting.\n\nSome effects of the UK withdrawal could emerge before the UK and the EU27 conclude the Article 50 negotiation, as a result of policies existing when the negotiation begins, or some change of policy later. At the outset policy provisions binding on the EU include principles, aspirations and objectives set out in the TEU (Treaty on European Union) Preamble and Articles, of which\n\nand\n\nPolicies mentioned in the Preamble include:\n\n– Achieve the strengthening and convergence of Member States' economies and establish an economic and monetary union including a single and stable currency,\n\n– Promote economic and social progress for their peoples, taking into account the principle of sustainable development and within the context of the accomplishment of the internal market and of reinforced cohesion and environmental protection, and implement policies ensuring that advances in economic integration are accompanied by parallel progress in other fields,\n\n– Establish a citizenship common to nationals of their countries,\n\n– Implement a common foreign and security policy including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, thereby reinforcing the European identity and its independence in order to promote peace, security and progress in Europe and in the world,\n\n– Facilitate the free movement of persons, while ensuring the safety and security of their peoples, by establishing an area of freedom, security and justice.\n\n– Continue the process of creating an ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.\n\nUK policy was stated in a white paper published in February 2017: \"The United Kingdom's exit from and new partnership with the European Union\". In the white paper, UK negotiating policy was set out as twelve guiding principles:\n\nA meeting at 10 Downing Street took place on 6 April 2017 between Theresa May and Donald Tusk to discuss \"the way ahead on Brexit\". Another meeting took place in London on 20 April 2017, this time between Theresa May and Antonio Tajani to discuss the rights of EU citizens. After 20 April meeting, Antonio Tajani said that the UK and EU27 timetables fitted well together, with a two-year exit deal negotiation followed by a three-year transition phase. A 10 Downing Street meeting between Theresa May, Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Juncker took place on 26 April to discuss the withdrawal process. May reiterated the UK's aim for a \"deep and special partnership\" after Brexit.\n\nAt a meeting on 29 April 2017 the EU27 unanimously endorsed the draft guidelines with no debate. A meeting took place between Michel Barnier and both houses of the Irish parliament on 11 May, where Barnier assured members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann that Europe would \"work with you to avoid a hard border\". Barnier went on to say that \"the Irish border issue would be one of his three priorities in the negotiations,\" and that \"there is always an answer\".\n\nThe UK retains its full EU rights until Brexit, and the EU is seeking to increase their budget, leading to the possibility that Britain may veto EU budget increases, which in the immediate term amount to 4 billion euros. A continued British veto would have far-reaching consequences and \"will hurt us\" according to German MEP Jens Geier.\n\nOn 19 June 2017, David Davis arrived in Brussels to start negotiations with Michel Barnier. Terms of reference were agreed, and dates were set for four-week cycles, to culminate in a fifth round of negotiations in the week commencing 9 October. Negotiating groups were established for three topics: the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and vice versa; Britain's outstanding financial obligations to the EU; and the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\n\nFour days of talks, largely between officials, were held in Brussels on 17–20 July. Progress was made in understanding each other's positions.\n\nOn citizens' rights, a joint paper compared the positions of the two parties in tabular form. On Irish border issues, both parties stated that they remained committed to the Good Friday Agreement. Michel Barnier called for clarification from the UK in the August round on the financial settlement, citizens' rights and Ireland, including on how the UK intends to maintain the Common Travel Area.\n\nTalks were held in Brussels on 28–31 August. Agreement was reached on points including protecting the rights of frontier workers (those living in one country and working in another); recognition by the UK of social security contributions made both before and after exit; and continuation of healthcare reimbursement for UK citizens who are in the EU27 on exit day and vice versa. The joint paper comparing the two parties' positions was updated.\n\nSpeaking at the conclusion of the talks, Michel Barnier highlighted two areas of disagreement: the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing citizens' rights, and the extent of the UK's financial obligations. He stated \"Time is passing quickly\" and added that \"at the current speed, we are far from being able to recommend to the European Council that there has been sufficient progress in order to start discussions on the future relationship\".\n\nOn 7 September the EU Task Force published guiding principles for the dialogue on Ireland / Northern Ireland which reiterated and expanded the principles given in 29 April guidelines, in particular the protection of the Good Friday Agreement and the continuation of the Common Travel Area.\n\nThe fourth round of talks began on 25 September, having been delayed by one week as Theresa May was due to deliver a speech in Florence on the 22nd. She proposed a transitional \"implementation period\" of \"around two years\" and said that the UK \"will honour commitments\" so as to not make other EU countries pay more or receive less during the current EU budget period.\n\nThe programme for the round of talks arranged for meetings between the \"Principals\" and for three negotiating groups covering citizens' rights, financial settlement and other separation issues, while Northern Ireland issues would be addressed by the \"Coordinators\", and governance of the withdrawal agreement was also for discussion at technical level.\n\nDavid Davis repeated Theresa May's request for a time-limited implementation period. The UK offered to incorporate the Withdrawal Agreement into UK law and ensure the UK courts can refer directly to it, but there was no agreement on the role of the European Court of Justice and the standing of future ECJ case law.\n\nMr Barnier welcomed the UK's commitment regarding payments into the current EU budget plan, but expressed reservations about obligations beyond 2020. Mr Davis said the UK was not yet in a position to quantify its commitments.\n\nThere were constructive discussions on the Irish border, but no substantive progress.\n\nThe UK accepted the EU's definition of 'citizens lawfully resident before the cut off date', although that date was not agreed. There was agreement on the definitions of permanent and temporary residence. The UK offered a more generous \"right of return\" (after absence for longer than two consecutive years) than the minimum rights under current EU law. Rights of future family members remains a point of disagreement. The joint paper comparing the two parties' positions was again updated.\n\nThe fifth round of negotiations was held on 9, 10 and 12 October. There was technical progress on citizens' rights, although divergences remained on aspects of family reunion and the export from the UK of social security benefits. The UK stated an intention to offer a simple process for registration of EU citizens. On the Irish border, work continued to map out current areas of cooperation and build a picture of the future challenges.\n\nOn the financial settlement, Michel Barnier welcomed the commitment made by Theresa May in her Florence speech, but no negotiations took place because the UK was not ready to give details of what it would pay. Barnier said this issue had reached an impasse.\n\nThis round of talks completed the timetable agreed in June, with no further rounds scheduled.\n\nFurther talks were held in Brussels on 9 and 10 November. Speaking at the closing press conference, Michel Barnier confirmed that clarification on financial commitments by the UK was required within the next two weeks. If the informal deadline is not met, the next phase of negotiations will not start in December, said Barnier. EU diplomats have described the situation as a \"chicken and egg dilemma\", as the EU will only start working on transition guidelines if Britain makes progress on financial issues by the end of November 2017. By 17 November, however, Donald Tusk said there was no deadlock in talks between Britain and the EU following a meeting with Theresa May in Gothenburg, Sweden and that he was optimistic that negotiations could move on to the next phase in December.\n\nDiscussions on the financial settlement took place later in the month, led by Oliver Robbins for the UK and Sabine Weyand for the EU.\n\nNegotiations between officials led to a draft agreement which was expected to be finalised at a meeting between Jean-Claude Juncker and Theresa May in Brussels on 4 December. There was progress on the financial settlement and citizens' rights, but the meeting was abandoned after Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party objected to arrangements for the Irish border; the agreement had earlier received the support of Leo Varadkar, Ireland's Taoiseach (prime minister).\n\nTalks continued on the following days, leading to publication on 8 December of a joint report setting out the commitments to be reflected in the Withdrawal Agreement. \"Agreement in principle\" was reached on the three areas:\nA joint technical note gave details of the consensus on citizens' rights. Topics postponed to a later phase included:\nJuncker described the agreement as a \"breakthrough\" Brexit deal. The second phase of negotiations – concerning Britain's post-Brexit trade with the EU – will now be able to take place as a result of the agreement.\n\nDiscussions on the outstanding issues continued and were described as \"low-key\".\n\nSeveral meetings took place between the negotiators.\n\nDue to the ambivalence of UK on the Irish border question, Tusk declared in March 2018 \"We know today that the UK Government rejects a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, the EU single market, and the customs union.\" Tusk's has said that talks cannot proceed around this issue, that it must be resolved first.\n\nThe second phase of the negotiation covers the arrangements for transition towards the UK's withdrawal, together with the framework for the future relationship.\n\nOn 15 December 2017, the European Council adopted guidelines for this phase. The document confirmed that progress in the first phase was \"sufficient\", while stating that commitments made in that phase must be \"translated faithfully into legal terms as quickly as possible\"; and notes the UK's proposal for a transition period of \"around two years\". On 20 December, the European Commission published a draft of the negotiating directives stating a transition period should not last beyond 31 December 2020. During the transition the United Kingdom would not be part of agreements the EU made on behalf of its members with third countries, such as CETA.\n\nThe European Council adopted and published negotiating directives on 29 January 2018. These state that the whole of the EU acquis (the rights and obligations binding on all member states) will continue to apply to the UK during the transition period. The UK will continue to be within the customs union and the single market, while no longer participating in EU decision-making. The UK's position was outlined in speeches and interviews.\n\nIn March 2018 resolution, the MEPs expect an EU-UK agreement which safeguard the framework of existing commercial relationships between the EU and third countries with consistency for keeping a tuned tariff and quota system and rules of origin for products vis-à-vis third and a countries, and also a\ntransitional arrangements fully compatible with WTO obligations to not disrupt trade relations with third countries.\n\nOn 19 March 2018, the transition period has been agreed while it can not be considered legally binding until after ratification of a wider agreement on withdrawal: \"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed,\".\n\nOn 19 March 2018, the document was published; text in green has been agreed. (75% agreed).\n\n\nA curious development with this release was the avoidance of mentioning what will happen with the free movement rights of UK citizens living abroad on the basis of those rights. The section which previously stated that those rights would be removed, article 32, was removed from the agreement, although references to it remain in other parts of the document.\n\nThe European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 that became law in the United Kingdom on 26 June 2018, and that were then progressing through Parliament relating to world and cross-border trade after the withdrawal, allow for various outcomes including no negotiated settlement. The two bills passed from the House of Commons to the House of Lords in July 2018.\n\nOn 6 July 2018, the UK Government announced that the May Cabinet had agreed that it should propose a \"UK-EU free trade area which establishes a common rule book for industrial goods and agricultural products\" [but not services] after Brexit. A few days earlier, senior EU officials had intimated that a proposal for \"partial\" membership of the European Single Market would not be welcomed. Before the Cabinet meeting at Chequers on 6 July, Barnier stated that the EU would accept a trade agreement with the UK if it does not damage the European Single Market. However, he said the EU would not shift its own red line on the single market, which he said was \"not and never should be seen as a big supermarket; it is economic, cultural and social life, it should be developed in all its dimensions\". On 10 July 2018, Barnier announced that 80% of the Brexit deal was now complete.\n\nThe government published the \"Chequers plan\" on 12 July 2018. In response to a statement about it by the Secretary of State, the opposition spokesman said that it was a disgrace that it had been shown to the media from 9 a.m. that morning but it had not been shown to MPs until hours later.\n\nWhile the President of the United States Donald Trump was on a visit to the United Kingdom on 13 July 2018, his comment – made in an exclusive interview with \"The Sun\" – that the UK would probably not get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's plan went ahead, was widely published in the media. Later the same day he stated, in a joint press conference with May at Chequers, that the Prime Minister was \"doing a fantastic job\" as prime minister, and contrary reports were \"fake news\", but he only asked for an \"even\" deal with the UK, and, complaining about EU trade barriers and tariffs on cars, he said that the US lost $151 billion to the EU. \"The Sun\", which had conducted the interview with Trump that was the original source of the comment, afterwards denied that it produced fake news and published the interview verbatim.\n\nWhile the negotiations continued, the UK government confirmed in the House of Commons on 19 July 2018 that the UK would be leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, as stated in the withdrawal act and the white paper. The first meeting of Dominic Raab, the newly appointed UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, with the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, was later on the same day (19 July 2018) in Brussels. Raab offered to meet Barnier throughout August to \"intensify\" talks, while both the UK and EU were insisting that reaching agreement by the autumn on the UK withdrawal in March 2019 was still very much on the cards.\n\nOn 20 July 2018, May repeated her opposition to the EU's proposals for the Irish border question during a speech in Belfast, stating that the EU must \"evolve\" and that there would be no further compromises over the issue. Just hours after the Prime Minister's remarks, Barnier expressed skepticism towards the Chequers plan. On 24 July 2018, May announced that she would now lead the Brexit negotiations with the EU and that Raab was now only \"deputizing\" on her behalf.\n\nOn 26 July, Barnier held another meeting with Raab and both stated afterwards stated in a joint press conference that \"sufficient progress\" had been made in the trade negotiations. Raab also stated during the joint press conference that \"a lot has been achieved.\" Barnier also stated that both sides wanted a wide-ranging free trade deal and that he would meet again with Raab in mid-August. However, he also acknowledged that obstacles remained due to the White Paper's proposal to allow Britain to collect custom duties on behalf of the EU and that the proposal would never be accepted for any non-member. Barnier also stated that the only other challenge in the trade negotiations was finalizing an agreement between both sides concerning a backstop that guarantees a frictionless border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Barnier stated that the EU holds \"no objections in principle\" to the backstop, but has \"doubts that it can be done without putting at risk the integrity of our customs union, our common commercial policy, our regulatory policy and our fiscal revenue.\"\n\nOn 2 August 2018, Barnier announced the EU was \"ready to improve the EU proposal\" on the issue of the Ireland border. Barnier stated that the EU was willing to be flexible on the details of the proposed backstop, but will \"not change the substance\". The backstop was originally proposed by the EU and has been a source of tension in the negotiations with Britain, which has viewed the backstop as a threat to the union with Northern Ireland. However, Barnier also stated the White Paper's customs proposal still remains an issue.\n\nOn 9 August 2018, \"The Times\" and \"Business Insider\" said that EU had made concessions and agreed to accept, among other things, a free trade deal which does not include free movement of EU citizens. Under the proposal, the EU would also accept the terms outlined in the White Paper if Britain agreed to abide by the EU's social, environment and customs rules. However, this would also include keeping Britain in the European Single Market for a longer period, which is a matter of concern for the British government. Agreeing to the single market proposal could potentially mean that Britain will be unable to change laws in order to give it a competitive edge against the EU and could hinder any chance of signing additional trade deals.\n\nOn 16 August 2018, EU and British officials began two days of talks to resolve the issue concerning the Irish border. However, Barnier and Raab did not attend the talks and both sides indicated there would be little chance of a breakthrough. On 16 August, leaked documents obtained by \"Buzzfeed News\" showed that May had now set plans for a \"no-deal\" Brexit for \"84 areas of life.\" The May government intends to start publicly disclosing the plans in the following week as a warning to the EU. On 18 August, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that the first batch of the papers detailing a no-deal Brexit are due to be published on 23 August.\n\nOn 21 August 2018, Barnier said that the EU and Britain would not reach a trade deal by the October EU summit and that an emergency summit would have to be held in either November or December. Both sides still disagree over a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. While there is a possibly that there could be a summit in December, this is highly unlikely to occur and November would be the most likely month to hold an emergency summit. Gabriele Zimmer, a leftist German member of the European Parliament who deals with Brexit, told Reuters \"we didn't see any concrete proposal that would work on the Irish border issue. November is the last moment. December is already too late for us.\" Despite the setback, however, Raab and Barnier both agreed to hold \"continuous talks\" in an effort to resolve the deadlock. Barnier stated that talks had previously been held in \"rounds\" every few weeks.\n\nThe first batch of \"no-deal\" Brexit advice was published by Raab on 23 August.\n\nOn 29 August, Barnier announced in Berlin that the EU would now offer a trade deal which would ensure close ties between the EU and Britain following Brexit. Barnier described the proposed trade deal as a partnership \"such as there never has been with any other third country.\" Though \"red lines\" still remained between the EU and Britain, Barnier also stated that the EU would also respect Britain's red lines, such as the Northern Ireland border, so long as Britain did not undermine the European Single Market. The same day, Raab announced to a House of Lords committee that a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU was now \"within our sights.\" Raab also stated that a vote at the EU October summit was still possible and that only \"a measure of leeway\" remained over the precise timetable for the agreement.\n\nOn 31 August, Raab and Barnier held a joint press conference in Brussels. Both stated that progress was made in the negotiations. Raab stated that Britain was now committed to a vote on a Brexit trade deal at the SU October Summit and that he was \"stubbornly optimistic that a trade deal was \"within reach.\" Barnier stated that the EU was also committed to an October EU Summit vote and that the \"building blocks\" of a trade deal were now falling into place. Certain issues are still being worked out.\n\nOn 4 September 2018, Raab stated to other MPs that he was now \"confident\" that the White Paper's proposals, dubbed the Chequers plan, would serve as the basis of the UK-EU trade deal. Raab also described the feedback from the EU as \"positive.\" The same day, the cross border trade bill passed its second reading, committee stages and third reading in the House of Lords; it later became law after receiving Royal Assent on 13 September. On 5 September, German Chancellor Angela Merkel dropped a key demand and announced that Germany would now accept a trade deal that is not fully detailed. Merkel also stated that Germany would work to preserve good and close relations with Britain following Brexit. On 5 September EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas stated that the EU saw some \"positive element\" in the Chequers plan and urged journalists to wait for a transcript to be published before making assumptions about how the EU feels about it.\n\nOn 7 September, it was revealed that Barnier had made a concession to a group of British MPs and stated that the EU will allow the trade agreement to be linked to the Brexit \"divorce bill.\" The EU Commission had long insisted that any trade agreement between the EU and Britain could not be linked to payment of financial settlements. This bill will amount to approximately £39 billion. \nDuring the meeting with the delegation of MPs, which took place in Brussels on 3 September, Barnier described May's White Paper as \"useful.\" Also on 7 September, British Finance Minister Philip Hammond stated that he was now \"sure\" that a trade deal would be reached by the original October deadline. On 13 September, Raab published a second batch of no-deal Brexit documents, this time containing 80 papers.\n\nOn 19 September at the EU summit in Salzburg, May reiterated her previous position the EU had to \"evolve\" its position concerning the Irish border.\n\nOn 4 October, Irish officials announced that Ireland would back May's \"all UK\" customs union proposal with the EU. On 5 October, Barnier stated that the post-Brexit EU-Britain trade deal was now \"very close.\" On 6 October, European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker stated that the post-Brexit trade deal between the EU and Britain was now \"close.\" The same day, European Council President Donald Tusk stated that a trade agreement between the EU and Britain would be reached, \"if not finalized,\" at the EU summit between 17 and 18 October. Juncker also stated that he was optimistic that the trade deal would be agreed to in time for approval at the summit. Irish government sources also issued a statement claiming that a deal over the Irish border was now \"very close.\" Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar also stated that the deal should be reached \"sooner rather than later.\"\n\nOn 9 October, Raab stated that he was now \"confident we will reach a deal this autumn.\" The same day, DUP leader Arlene Foster, whose party has the largest number of seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly, travelled to Brussels and warned EU officials that she would not support any EU backstop proposal which would create greater economic barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain.\n\nOn 10 October, Barnier stated that a trade deal at the start of the EU summit on 17 October was now \"within reach.\" Despite hinting that a deal would earn early approval \"if we have the negotiations on October 17,\" Barnier still insisted that a customs union would prevent border checks at the Irish border. The trade deal was also welcomed by Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, though each also stressed caution until its details were published. The EU also cancelled plans to publish its version of documents pertaining to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. The same day, Britain's FCA published more documents pertaining to the possibility of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nOn 11 October, \"The Daily Telegraph\" reported that the EU and Britain had made further concessions and agreed to an \"all-UK\" backstop at the Irish border which will have \"no time limit.\" The same day, EU and British diplomats involved the negotiations stated that a trade deal was now expected by 15 October. May also informed members of her cabinet that a \"historic\" Brexit deal was now \"close.\" One official who was familiar with the meeting backed the Prime Minister's claim and stated that a trade deal agreement between Britain and the EU was \"practically done.\" Despite the progress which was made in achieving a compromise over the Irish border, May, addressing concerns from the DUP, later spoke with reporters from Northern Ireland and stated that talks concerning the backstop would still continue until November. Barnier also made another concession and offered to allow Britain's stay in the EU customs union to be only \"temporary\" and suggested Britain should continue to apply the EU's external tariffs.\n\nOn 14 October, a spokeswoman for Britain's Brexit ministry announced progress \"in a number of key areas,\" but acknowledged that the British government will still not support a backstop at the Irish border. Barnier, who held surprise talks with Raab, stated \"some issues are still open.\" The EU Ambassadors from all the other 27 EU nations were summoned to Brussels as well. It has also been agreed that talks will not resume until the start of the EU summit on 17 October. Also during this day, EU and British diplomats completed negotiating a draft post-Brexit trade deal between Britain and the EU. However, May and Raab rejected this proposed trade deal due to terms which were written regarding the Irish border backstop.\n\nOn October 15, May stated that the British government's difference with the EU now \"aren't far apart,\" but that the EU now had to terminate plans for a backstop at the Irish border. On October 16, May's cabinet officially backed her Brexit strategy. The same day, French President Emmanuel Macron, who is considered to have taken the most hardline stance in the Brexit negotiations, made a concession and offered to support a \"temporary\" backstop at the Irish border. Before departing for the EU summit on October 17, May stated to reporters that \"now is the time\" for the deal and that she was also confident that it would move forward at some point \"with the full package.\" The same day, Varadkar announced a major concession over the backstop, agreeing to make it only temporary. Varadkar also stated that he wished to preserve current trade relations with Britain and hinted that another summit would be held in November. The Polish government, which has broken ranks with several other EU governments to support Britain's Brexit stance, also warned other EU leaders not to \"play with fire.\"\n\nDuring the summit, May rejected another drafted trade deal offered by the EU which would've extended the transition period, due to the fact that it would've resulted in adding around £5bn to the £39bn \"divorce bill.\" On the first day, October 17, May met with Macron, Varadkar, Tusk and Juncker and also delivered a 30-minute speech to all 27 EU leaders. Following her speech, European Parliament chief Antonio Tajani stated \"the tone was more relaxed than in Salzburg, undoubtedly. There was a message of goodwill and readiness to reach an agreement, but I didn't perceive anything substantially new in terms of content as I listened to Mrs May.\" EU leaders also cancelled their plans to hold an extraordinary summit in November due to lack of progress.\n\nOn 18 October, Spain reached an agreement with Britain and agreed to no longer hold any objection to the nearby British coastal peninsula of Gibraltar leaving the EU with Britain. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez even stated “Gibraltar will no longer be a problem in arriving at a Brexit deal.\" Any dispute between Britain and Spain over the status of Gibraltar will also no longer affect a potential trade agreement between Britain and the EU.\n\nOn 21 October, it was reported that trade negotiations between Britain and the EU were now 95% complete and that May had managed to not only resolve the issue surrounding Gibraltar's EU departure, but had also managed to develop a protocol concerning the UK's military presence in Cyprus and agreed to a mechanism for resolving any future disputes with the EU. On October 22, May confirmed this during a speech in the House of Commons. The British Prime Minister also laid the four elements related to the remaining 5% which remained unresolved, all of which are related to the Irish border.\n\nOn 22 October, Reuters reported that EU sources had told them the EU was \"looking at ways to promise Britain a customs deal that could stretch Brussels’ Brexit red lines but might break a deadlock over the Irish border.\" On 23 October, EU sources informed the Irish RTE news agency that the EU had made another concession and agreed to a separate treaty ensuring a \"UK-wide\" customs union which is not \"Northern Ireland-only.\" This customs union proposal, which May claimed would further preserve the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which resulted in the implementation of the Northern Ireland peace process, was one of the four steps which the British Prime Minister proposed for breaking the Irish border impasse. When asked if this offer by the EU guaranteed a trade deal, May's spokesman stated that more needs to be done and that \"any circumstance in which Northern Ireland could be in a separate customs territory to the UK is unacceptable.\" \"The Business Times\" reported that May was now optimistic that the negotiations for the trade deal would be wrapped up by the end of November. A spokesperson for 10 Downing Street also denied media reports that her Cabinet has been engaged in a \"row\" over her proposal to end the impasse over the Irish border and that there was merely an \"impassioned\" agreement that there should be a guarantee of no indefinite extension of the customs union.\n\nOn October 24, May confirmed to reporters that there was now a proposal to extend the transition period \"by a matter of months.\" However, May also stated that this proposal \"is not expected to be used.\" Leaked papers also revealed that May wanted an agreement from her Cabinet on the next phase of negotiations by the following week and that the proposal was at best a one-year extension of the transition period. Tusk afterwards stated \"if the UK decided that such an extension would be helpful to reach a deal, I am sure that the leaders would be ready to consider it positively.” Tusk also stated that the proposal, which May only considers to be an option if needed, was originally brought up May during discussions at the October EU Summit. The prevention of an indefinite customs union and assurance from the EU that it an extension would only be an option were two of the four steps which May cited to the end Irish border impasse as well.\n\nOn 31 October, a letter dated 24 October was published revealed that Raab stated to at least one lawmaker that a trade deal would be finalized by the European Union by 21 November and that the end of negotiations was now \"firmly in sight\" According to Raab, the Prime Minister's four points regarding Northern Ireland were the only issues that still needed to be resolved by this point in time.\n\nOn 8 November 2018, it was announced that the EU had made concessions and offered a \"level playing field\" post-Brexit trade deal if Britain were to agree to the backstop. In a press conference, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt stated that he was \"optimistic\" that the planned November EU special summit which had been cancelled at the October summit would now take place before the end of November. It was acknowledged differences still remained over the lifespan of this new offer.\n\nOn 12 November, Barnier stated that the Brexit deal was almost ready, but still needed political endorsement. Barnier also claimed that the text would be presented to May's Cabinet on 13 November. However, the Prime Minister's office denied that May was ready to accept the EU's latest offer. May later delivered a televised speech where she declared that \"the negotiations for our departure are now in the endgame\" and insisted that she still will not accept a trade deal which hampers Britain's border and economic sovereignty. On 13 November 2018, the UK government and EU agreed on the text of the proposed withdrawal agreement. On 14 November 2018, following a five-hour Cabinet meeting, May announced that her Cabinet approved the draft agreement.\n\nOn 15 November 2018, Tusk stated that a new summit will be on 25 November 2018 for EU and that a meeting to discuss preparations for this summit would be held on 20 November. On 17 November 2018 May wrote in \"The Sun\" that the deal will end both free movement of people and ECJ rule over Britain, and also protect millions of British jobs. She stated that the November EU summit would go ahead as scheduled. On 18 November, May told \"Sky News\" that she would attend a meeting in Brussels during the next week.\n\nOn 19 November 2018, EU ministers endorsed the draft agreement. The same day, the deal was endorsed by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). On 20 November 2018, the deal won the endorsement of the Bank of England. \n\nOn November 21, May traveled to Brussels to hold a meeting with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The Commission released a statement that stated that \"very good progress\" had been made during this meeting. Juncker also cancelled a planned two-day trip to the Canary Islands in order to work with \"the many important events taking place at the moment.\" Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis stated that the \"sherpas\" - officials tasked with doing the detailed work ahead of summits - are scheduled to meet on 23 November to work on the final texts of the withdrawal agreement and the future relationship. On 22 November, European Council President Donald Tusk announced the European Commission's approval of the draft agreement, thus paving the way for the summit which concerns the European Council vote. Tusk also sent a political declaration regarding future EU relations with Britain to the EU27 states and called on their ruling governments to draft it.\n\nOn 22 November, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez tweeted, following a phone conversation with May over Gibraltar at Juncker's encouragment, that Britain and Spain still remained \"far apart.\" Nevertheless, May stated that she was still \"confident\" that she and Sánchez \"will be able to agree a deal that delivers for the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.\" On 23 November 2018, the sherpas met, though the dispute with Spain over the issue of Gibraltar ensured that May's meeting with Juncker on 24 November will involve resolving the issue in person. Despite new threats from Sánchez of a veto to the trade deal, it has also been acknowledged, including by Spanish Foreign Minister Josep Borrell, that Spain will have no such power at 25 November summit and that any objection at this summit would merely be a sign of EU disunity. It was also acknowledged that Spain's main dispute with Britain was not Gibraltar's departure from the EU with Britain or future trade deals with Britain, but rather that Britain agree to exclude Gibraltar in future negotiations not related to the Gibraltar dispute. The same day, the sherpas agreed a third Brexit document concerning level playing fields with regards to competition with British companies and use of UK fisheries. \n\nOn 24 November, Tusk announced that an agreement had been brokered between Britain and Spain and over the Gibraltar dispute and that the dispute will not cancel the upcoming summit. Sánchez confirmed this and also stated that Spain would vote yes on the withdrawal agreement. On 25 November 2018, all of the leaders of the EU27 nations endorsed the Brexit deal at the summit. On November 26, May announced that the Parliament vote on the deal will be held on 11 December 2018. US President Donald Trump has objected to the deal.\n\nOn 28 June 2016, five days after the referendum, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel announced to the German parliament the forthcoming EU negotiation position: the UK could only remain in the European Single Market (ESM) if the UK accepted EU migrants. There would be no cherrypicking of the ESM's four conditions (free movement of goods, capital, services and labour). While she expected the UK to remain an important NATO partner, the EU's priority was unity and self-preservation. She warned the UK not to delude itself. The next day, Tusk confirmed that the UK would not be allowed access to the ESM unless they accepted its four freedoms of movement for goods, capital, services, and people.\n\nIn contrast, at her October 2016 party conference, Prime Minister Theresa May emphasised that ending the jurisdiction of EU law and free movement from Europe were priorities. She wished \"to give British companies the maximum freedom to trade with and operate in the Single Market – and let European businesses do the same here\", but not at the expense of losing sovereignty.\n\nIn November 2016, May proposed that Britain and the other EU countries mutually guarantee the residency rights of the 3.3 million EU immigrants in Britain and those of the 1.2 million British citizens living on the Continent, in order to exclude their fates being bargained during Brexit negotiations. Despite initial approval from a majority of EU states, May's proposal was blocked by European Council President Tusk and German Chancellor Merkel.\n\nIn January 2017, the Prime Minister presented 12 negotiating objectives and confirmed that the UK government would not seek permanent single market membership. The European Parliament's lead negotiator Guy Verhofstadt responded that there could be no \"cherry-picking\" by the UK in the talks.\n\nThe statutory period for negotiation began on 29 March 2017, when the letter notifying withdrawal, signed by the British Prime Minister, was handed to the president of the European Council. The letter called for a \"deep and special relationship\" between the UK and the EU, and warned that failure to reach an agreement would result in EU-UK trade under World Trade Organisation terms, and a weakening of the UK's cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism. The letter suggested prioritising an early deal on the rights of EU citizens in the UK and vice versa. In the letter, the Prime Minister reasoned that, as the EU leaders did not wish \"cherry picking\" of the ESM, the UK would not seek to remain within the ESM. Instead, the UK would seek a free trade agreement with the EU. In response, Merkel insisted that the EU would not discuss future cooperation without first settling the divorce, Verhofstadt referred to the letter as \"blackmail\" with regard to the point on security and terrorism, and EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said the UK's decision to quit the block was a \"choice they will regret one day\".\n\nOn 29 April 2017, immediately after the first round of French presidential elections, the EU27 heads of state accepted, without discussion, negotiating guidelines prepared by the President of the European Council. The guidelines take the view that Article 50 permits a two-phased negotiation, whereby the UK first needs to agree to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, before the EU27 will entertain negotiations on a future relationship. In the requested first phase of the withdrawal negotiation, the EU27 negotiators demand the UK pay a \"divorce bill\", initially estimated as amounting up to £52bn and then, after additional financial demands from Germany, France, and Poland, amounting to £92bn. Nevertheless, a report of the European Union Committee of the House of Lords published on 4 March 2017 states that if there is no post-Brexit deal at the end of the two-year negotiating period, the UK could withdraw without payment. Similarly, the Prime Minister insisted to EU Commission President Juncker that talks about the future UK-EU relationship should start early and that Britain did not owe any money to the EU under the current treaties.\n\nOn the EU27 side, unflattering details of a four-way meeting between Prime Minister Theresa May, Brexit Minister David Davis, EU Commission President Juncker and his chief-of-staff Martin Selmayr were leaked to the German newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\", presumably by Martin Selmayr. According to the leaked description, Juncker claimed that Theresa May was \"living in another galaxy\" when suggesting that British and EU migrant rights could be rapidly negotiated and agreed in the course of June 2017. German Chancellor Angela Merkel concurred the next day by stating that there were \"illusions\" on the British side. A few days later, Juncker disclaimed responsibility and called the leak a mistake, \"Der Spiegel\" magazine reported that Angela Merkel was annoyed with Juncker for the leak, while European Council President Tusk admonished participants to use discretion during the negotiations. The background for German nervousness allegedly is the possibility that Britain may veto EU budget increases, which for example in the immediate term amount to 4 billion euros. A continued British veto would have far-reaching consequences and \"will hurt us\" according to German MEP Jens Geier.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, the European Council authorised its negotiators to start the Brexit talks and it adopted its negotiating directives. The first day of talks took place on 19 June, where Davis and Barnier agreed to prioritise the question of residency rights, while Davis conceded that a discussion of the Northern Irish border would have to await future trade agreements.\n\nOn 22 June 2017, Prime Minister May guaranteed, at a European Council meeting in Brussels, that no EU citizen living legally in the UK would be forced to leave, and she offered that any EU citizen living in the UK for more than 5 years until an unspecified deadline between March 2017 and March 2019 would enjoy the same rights as a UK citizen, conditional on the EU providing the same offer to British expatriates living in the EU. The EU leaders did not immediately reciprocate the offer, with Council President Tusk objecting that the European Council is not a forum for the Brexit negotiations, and Commission president Juncker stating \"I'm not negotiating here.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister detailed her residency proposals in the House of Commons on 26 June 2017, but drew no concessions from EU negotiators, who had declined to expedite agreement on expatriates by the end of June 2017, and who are hoping for European courts to continue to have jurisdiction in the UK with regards to EU citizens, according to their negotiation aims published in May 2017.\n\nThe second round of negotiations began in Brussels in mid-July 2017. It is considered the beginning of substantial negotiations, with 98 UK negotiators and 45 EU27 negotiators. Progress is being made on the Northern Irish border question, whereas UK negotiators have requested a detailed breakdown of the \"divorce bill\" demand estimated at 65 billion euros, while the EU negotiators criticise the UK's citizenship rights offer. At the concluding press conference, David Davis did not commit to a net payment by the UK to the EU with regards to the requested divorce bill, while Michel Barnier explained that he would not compromise on his demand for the European Court of Justice to have continuing jurisdiction over the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit, rejecting the compromise proposal of a new international body made up of British and EU judges.\n\nOn 16 August 2017, the British government disclosed the first of several papers detailing British ambitions following Brexit, discussing trade and customs arrangements. On 23 August 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that Britain will leave the EU Court of Justice's direct jurisdiction when the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 ends, but that both the British courts and the EU Court of Justice will also keep \"half an eye\" on each other's rulings afterwards as well. One of the UK government's position papers published in August called for no additional restrictions for goods already on the market in the UK and EU.\n\nThe third round of negotiations began in Brussels on 28 August 2017. The European Commission president Juncker criticised the UK's Brexit negotiations, saying none of the papers provided so far were satisfactory and that there would be no trade negotiations between the EU and UK until the divorce bill was settled. He had previously claimed that the UK's Brexit bill could be £55bn (which Theresa May's government ministers consider unacceptable) and EU Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger voiced the view that the UK should make payments until 2023. The \"Irish Times\" explained the disagreement as follows: British negotiators referred to the seven-year Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF or Maff) for the period 2014-2020 agreed by member states and the EU parliament as a \"planning tool\" for the next period rather than a legally-binding financial obligation on member states. The British case is that the MFF sets ceilings on spending under various headings and is later radically revised during the annual budget process when real legal obligations on each state arises. This contrasts with the EU Commission's methodology for calculating the UK Brexit bill which involves dividing the MFF into the shares historically agreed by each member state. On the Irish border question there was a \"breakthrough\", with the British side guaranteeing free movement of EU citizens within the Common travel area constituting Ireland and the United Kingdom. The BBC's Europe correspondent commented \"the British perception of the talks is more positive than the EU's\".\n\nAt the elite European Ambrosetti Forum on 2 September 2017, Michel Barnier explained his negotiation aims, in that he would \"teach the British people and others what leaving the EU means\". Although this remark caused controversy in the UK, BBC correspondent Mark Mardell interpreted it in the context of French and Dutch euroscepticism, of the forthcoming German, Austrian and Italian elections, and of the eurosceptic Polish and Hungarian governments.\n\nIn a statement to Parliament on 5 September 2017, David Davis said that \"concrete progress\" had been made over the summer in areas such as protecting the rights of British expats in the EU to access healthcare and over the future of the Irish border, while significant differences over the \"divorce bill\" remain. He expected that \"the money argument will go on for the full duration of the negotiation. The famous European \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\" will apply here absolutely, as anywhere else\".\n\nOn 6 September 2017, Prime Minister May announced that new immigration controls will be placed on EU nationals when Brexit concludes.\n\nOn 9 September 2017, the EU Commission published several negotiating papers, including \"Guiding Principles on the Dialogue for Ireland/Northern Ireland\". In it, the EU concedes/declares that it is the responsibility of the UK to propose solutions for the post-Brexit Irish border. The paper envisages that a \"unique\" solution would be permissible here; in other words, any such exceptional Irish solution should not be seen as a template for post-Brexit relationships with the other EU members on border and customs control matters, for example ETIAS.\n\nAt the European Council meeting of 19/20 October 2017, the 27 leaders of the EU states were to decide whether or not to start trade negotiations with the UK. However, David Davis has conceded that so soon after the German elections on 24 September, a German coalition government may not be in place in time for making this decision in October, delaying any European Council decision until their December meeting.\n\nOn 21 September 2017, Prime Minister May, along with her Cabinet, agreed to a transition deal which would inject 20bn euros to the EU budget over a two-year period. A cabinet source confirmed to the BBC that May's Cabinet was in fact unity around the Prime Minister's two year transition deal.\n\nOn 22 September 2017, May announced the details of her Brexit proposal during a speech in Florence, Italy. In addition to offering 20 billion euros over a two-year transition period and continued acceptance of European immigrants, she also offered a \"bold new security relationship\" with the EU which would be \"unprecedented in its depth\" and to continue to make \"an ongoing contribution\" to projects considered greatly to the EU and UK's advantage, such as science and security projects. She also confirmed that the UK would not \"stand in the way\" of Juncker's proposals for further EU integration. The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier welcomed May's proposal as \"constructive,\" but that it also \"must be translated into negotiating positions to make meaningful progress;\" Similarly, President of France Emmanuel Macron was adamant that the EU would not begin negotiations on future EU-UK relationships until \"the regulation of European citizens, the financial terms of the exit, and the questions of Ireland\" were \"clarified\" by the UK, though he also acknowledged that May did give openings in her speech on two of these three points. Ireland Taoiseach Leo Varadkar gave May's proposal a \"cautious welcome,\" saying that while it was good of May to reference the Common Travel Area, the Northern Ireland peace process and that both sides in the negotiations do not want any physical structures at the border, more negotiations were needed for clarification. EU Parliamentary negotiator Guy Verhofstadt responded that \"a new registration mechanism for EU citizens going to live and/or work in the UK is out of the question\".\n\nEU negotiators have stated that an agreement must be reached between Britain and the EU by October 2018 in order to leave time for national parliaments to endorse Brexit.\n\nOn the domestic front, Labour Party MP and Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott announced she would back May's proposed negotiation for the Brexit timetable.\n\nThe programme for the fourth round of talks beginning on 25 September arranged for meetings between the \"Principals\" and for three negotiating groups covering citizens' rights, financial settlement and other separation issues, while Northern Ireland issues would be addressed by the \"Coordinators\", and governance of the withdrawal agreement would be discussed at technical level.\n\nOn 16 October, May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker issued a joint statement agreeing Brexit talks should \"accelerate over the months to come\" following a dinner meeting in Brussels which both described as \"constructive and friendly.\" However, as at a similar dinner earlier in 2017, an unflattering \"impressionistic\" account of this meeting (between Prime Minister Theresa May, her chief Brexit adviser Olly Robbins, Brexit Minister David Davis, EU Commission President Juncker and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier) was published in the same German newspaper \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\". Again, Juncker's chief-of-staff Martin Selmayr was accused as the source of the publication and of trying to undermine the negotiations. This time however Selmayr denied the accusation, and Chancellor Merkel reportedly denied her involvement.\n\nOn 17 October, Brexit Secretary David Davis insisted that there will be no deal for a transition phase without EU cooperation and that Brexit will happen regardless, even if there is what one Conservative MP described as \"a bridge to nowhere.\"\n\nOn 19 October, the first day of the two-day European Council meeting in Brussels, May issued a direct message to approximately three million EU citizens living in Britain, promising she will make it as easy as possible for them to stay after Brexit. On 20 October, Tusk described media reports of the deadlock in Brexit talks as \"exaggerated.\"\n\nOn 23 October, May announced to the House of Commons that Brexit talks underwent \"important progress\" during her recent meeting with the European Council and that Britain was now \"in touching distance\" of a trade deal with EU countries, while also reiterating that no transition phase will take place following the conclusion of Brexit without a trade deal as well. The same day, Juncker denied reports by the German media that May had \"begged for help\" during their recent dinner meeting.\n\nIn the wake of the German elections (23 September 2017), as of 10 November, negotiations were still ongoing to form a coalition government between Frau Merkel's CDU, the sister party CSU, the economically liberal FDP and the German Greens; politicians from all three factions published an appeal to reach a coalition agreement (rather than risk new elections), in the interest of Germany forming a \"stable anchor\" to unite with France and defend the EU and the euro in the current situation.\n\nDuring the sixth round of meetings in Brussels between UK and EU negotiators on 9–10 November, Michel Barnier set the UK a deadline of two weeks to specify a divorce bill that the UK would pay, without which the UK would not be permitted to start trade negotiations in December 2017. Meanwhile, David Davis rejected an EU proposal that Northern Ireland could remain in the EU customs union (thereby creating a customs border \"down the Irish Sea\" with Great Britain).\n\nAfter more than 2 months of a caretaker German government since the German federal elections in September, on 7 December 2017 new elections were averted when the German socialist party under Martin Schulz agreed to negotiate a coalition government with Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat party, but on condition that a \"United States of Europe\" be created by 2025, dismissing those EU member states who were unwilling to participate.\n\nThe following day (8 December), the UK and EU negotiators agreed on the principle that \"nothing is agreed until everything is agreed\" and formally announced to proceed immediately to the next phase of talks on a transition period and future trade relationships.\n\nThe EU's negotiating position as at 10 November 2017 was that a future trade relationship between EU and UK should be made conditional upon requirements which would handicap the UK's freedom to negotiate free trade deals with the rest of the world; and that no free trade deal can be agreed in parallel with the Article 50 withdrawal agreement because each of the 27 EU countries would be expected to veto it if they would otherwise face competition from the UK on tax, employment conditions, safety regulations and relaxation of restrictions on GM crops; and that the EU would require any transitional deal to be signed as part of a withdrawal agreement before any agreement was in place on the UK's future relationship with the EU, so that existing arrangements would continue to apply during any transitional period, with the Single Market, Customs Union and European Court of Justice having the same roles as at present, and preventing the UK having control of EU immigration during that period or having the right to enter into trade deals with other countries.\n\nTwo different but incompatible legal approaches would be considered for the Brexit. The EU approach is top down while the British approach is bottom-up. This difference of approach raises a serious problem of confidence. From Michel Barnier point of view, what was decided by 28 member states, has to be paid by 28 member states till the end.\n\nThe issue of payments by the UK to the EU as part of the exit agreement is subject to much conjecture and has been divided into two broad questions. Firstly, whether a leaving state is legally obligated to contribute to the EU budget beyond its membership period or compensate for any financial losses that EU may suffer on account of withdrawal, given that Article 50 does not concern itself with financial ramifications of a withdrawal; and secondly – if the United Kingdom is legally obligated to pay – what should be the due amount.\n\nThe leaders of France and Germany have both stated that the UK would need to agree terms regarding the departure before discussing future relationships. This has been reinforced by EU27 guidelines issued to the remaining 27 countries. The UK has signalled that it may consider paying the EU to attain preferential access to the economic Single Market and may offer to pay liabilities, even if not legally obligated, on a moral and co-operative basis to secure a preferential working relationship with the EU.\n\nThe highest reported claim by the EU is around €60 billion (£50 billion). In March 2017 the Bruegel think tank estimated that the UK would need to pay at least €25.4 billion, but the method of calculation is debatable and their calculations using seven different methods produced estimates between €30 and €45 billion. However this £50 billion bill includes the United Kingdom's annual EU contribution (approximately £13 billion annually) for the two years from 2020 and 2021 as agreed in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The United Kingdom, in accordance with Article 50 and unless otherwise extended, will cease to be a member of the EU from 29 March 2019 and the MFF does have a provision for \"unforeseen circumstances\".\n\nEU27 is expected to ask the UK to pay its liabilities in euros, including the relocation costs associated with the two EU bodies currently based in London.\n\nSpeaking on 20 April, Antonio Tajani said that it was too early to quantify the amount the UK would need to pay and that it was not a bill to leave the EU, it was money needed for farmers and small businesses.\n\nA March 2017 House of Lords report acknowledges that the EU may claim for (1) part of the current budget (which runs from 2014 to 2020) post March 2019, because it was approved by the UK (2) part of the EU future commitments which amount to €200 billion and (3) a contribution if the UK is to continue with access to some EU programmes. The report concluded that the UK had no legal obligation to make \"exit\" payments to the EU if there was no post Brexit deal.\n\nDiscussing financial and legal complexities involved in negotiating withdrawal, including settlement of outstanding financial liabilities and division of assets, the report mentions (paragraph 15) that the EU budget is funded by revenue drawn from various sources, governed by the EU's Own Resources Decision (ORD), which was made part of UK law by the European Union (Finance) Act 2015. The revenue includes contributions from import duties and VAT collected by member states. The report also mentions the EU Multiannual Financial Framework for controlling the annual expenditure.\n\nThe EU has considerable assets including buildings, equipment and financial instruments, and there is a potential claim by the UK for a portion of these assets. Boris Johnson, the UK's Foreign Secretary, commenting on the Brexit \"divorce bill\" in May 2017 stated that the valuable EU assets the UK has paid for over the years should be properly valued, and that there were good arguments for including them in the negotiations.\n\nThe Bank of England (BoE) has invested in the European Central Bank (ECB) amounting to 13.6743%, representing paid up capital of €55.5 billion. The BoE does not participate in any profits (or losses) of the ECB. The BoE has also made loans to the ECB. The ECB set up the European Financial Stability Facility in 2010, which has a borrowing facility of €440bn and in addition used a guarantee from the European Commission and the Budget of the European Union as collateral to borrow a further €60bn. The UK withdrawal will affect the ECB.\n\nThe EU has a pension liability of €64 billion.\n\nThe UK benefits from a rebate which reduces its contribution to the EU budget. The rebate is paid a year in arrears, accordingly the 2019 rebate would be payable in 2020.\n\nThe EU drafted a 10-page position document regarding the single bill. This position does not define the final cost of the divorce.\n\nConcerns have been raised by UK citizens who live in other EU countries, and by citizens from those countries who live in the UK. In May 2017, Michel Barnier stated: \"Currently around 3.2 million EU citizens work and live in the UK, and 1.2 million British citizens work and live in the EU.\"\n\nIssues include rights of movement, citizenship, abode, education, social support and medical treatment, and the payment of pensions; and the extent to which these rights apply to family members. Considerations for UK citizens resident in an EU27 country include their rights to work or live in a different EU27 country. Beyond the 27 EU countries, workers have certain freedom of movement rights to/from Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.\n\n\"Associate citizenship\", suggested by EU27 negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, would allow UK nationals to volunteer individually for EU citizenship, enabling them to continue to work and live on the continent. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, is not opposed to the idea.\n\nAntonio Tajani spoke after a meeting with Theresa May on 20 April 2017, saying \"the issue of reciprocal EU citizen rights should be negotiated 'immediately' with a view to getting an agreement by the end of the year.\" The European Commission published a position paper on \"Essential Principles on Citizens' Rights\" on 12 June 2017, proposing that current and future family members of European nationals in the UK would keep their rights to settle in their residence country at any time after Britain's withdrawal. Speaking in advance of publication of the paper, David Davis described the demands as \"ridiculously high\". The UK government published their policy paper \"Safeguarding the position of EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU\" on 26 June. The policy paper proposed that EU citizens living in Britain will be required to apply for inclusion on a \"settled status\" register if they wish to remain in the country after Brexit.\n\nBy the end of September 2017 progress had been made on several of the 60 points which became green, while 13 out of the 60 points remain red. Three points (points #14, #15, and #16 related to monitoring and CJEU) have to be addressed at governance level. Few points remain to be clarified (that is yellow). On this basis European parliament will have to assess if sufficient progress has been made.\n\nAs of October 2018, UK residents in the EU have not yet had their fates decided on: On 16 October 2018, just before departing for the EU27-UK summit in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking to the German parliament, asked \"How do we treat the 100,000 British citizens in Germany on the day after Brexit if there is no deal?\", without supplying an answer.\n\nThe general rule for losing EU citizenship is that European citizenship is lost if member state nationality is lost, but the automatic loss of EU citizenship as a result of a member state withdrawing from the EU is the subject of debate. The situation of a person acquiring EU citizenship when the UK joined the EU in 1973 compared to a person born in the UK after 1973 and was therefore born into EU citizenship, may differ. It may be necessary for the ECJ to rule on these issues.\n\nIn a 2017 decision, the ECJ ruled that the parent/s of a child with EU nationality are entitled to rights of residence, even if both non EU citizens. This may have consequential effects for UK residents who have young children and wish to live in the EU27 territory post Brexit, but this remains to be tested.\n\nUntil the UK effectively withdraws from the EU in 2019 or at another agreed date, the current system of free movement of labour between the EU27 and the UK remains in place.\n\nThe report of the House of Commons Exiting the European Union Committee on \"The Government's negotiating objectives\", published in April 2017, proposed (paragraphs 20 and 123) that the future system for EU migration should meet the needs of different sectors of the UK economy, including those employing scientists, bankers, vets, care workers, health service professionals and seasonal agriculture workers.\n\nTheresa May, answering press questions on 5 April 2017, commented that the free movement of labour would not end in March 2019; an implementation period of possibly five years would give business and government time to adjust.\n\nThe UK currently charges an annual levy of up to £1,000 for each non-EU citizen employed within the UK. Proposals are under consideration to increase this 'immigration skills charge' to £2,000 p.a. and to implement a similar levy on EU citizens employed in the UK.\n\nAccording to an unconfirmed newspaper report, a leaked Home Office paper has a proposal that the UK will end the free movement of labour of low-skilled workers immediately after Brexit, focusing on highly skilled EU workers instead. The proposal would limit lower-skilled EU migrants' residency permits to a maximum of two years, and the implementation of a new immigration system ending the right to settle in Britain for most European migrants while placing tough restrictions on their rights to bring over family members. Those in \"high-skilled occupations\" could be given permission to work in the UK for a period of three to five years.\n\nImmigration is one topic requiring partnership between EU and UK, as according to Theresa May, \"Mass migration and terrorism are but two examples of the challenges to our shared European interests and values that we can only solve in partnership\".\n\nIn the context of Brexit, the question of migration might contains two subtopics: on one hand migrations between EU including UK and third countries which might be dealt with at a local level; and on the other hand migration between EU and UK once UK has become a third country which was discussed for the withdrawal agreement.\n\nThe concept of European Court of Justice competence creates complications. Some pro-Brexiteers believe the Court of Justice might be completely removed from the UK landscape. Various other opinions consider that the Court of Justice or some equivalent should be able to rule on remaining issues after Brexit (for instance between a European and a British stakeholder), at least in respect of the TEU (Treaty on European Union), European Union citizens, or access to the European Single Market.\n\nAfter the 2017 negotiations, in February 2018 the European Commission Draft Withdrawal Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community consider for instance that:\n\nBrexit might have impact in various sectors.\n\nDocuments setting out how the Brexit will affect parts of the British economy were set up for the government, \"the most comprehensive picture of our economy on this issue\" containing \"excruciating detail\" according to Brexit Secretary David Davis. The ministers were reluctant to publish them but in November, a vote in Parliament allowed lawmakers to read them under controlled conditions to avoid news leaks. They were released online on 21 December 2017 but lawmakers were unimpressed: \"Most of this could be found on Wikipedia or with a quick Google search,\" said Labour's David Lammy, \"these documents [were made] in a couple of weeks. They look like copy and paste essay crises.\"\n\nWithout a trade agreement in place, UK trade with the EU would be governed by the World Trade Organization's Bali Package. This would lead to common tariffs and non-tariff barriers being imposed by the EU27 upon the UK's access to the European Single Market, because the Market is also a customs union. However, the UK would then have an opportunity to control immigration as well as develop its own trade regulations.\n\nThe UK is not permitted to hold trade talks until after Brexit is concluded, however the UK can do preparatory work with other countries regarding the UK's future trading relationships; this is not to the liking of some EU27 countries. Before Britain leaves the EU, they may put trade agreements in place with non-EU countries.\n\nOnly the EU can act in areas where it has exclusive competence, such as the customs union and common commercial policy. In those areas Member States may not act independently. The UK can still negotiate its own bilateral investment protection treaties subject to Commission authorization.\n\nStrategic controls on military goods are primarily a Member State competence. As a result, Member States themselves negotiate multilateral or bilateral agreements on the strategic aspects of trade in defense goods.\n\nThe EU27 wish to exclude the UK from sitting in on trade negotiations held by the EU during the period ending March 2019, seeing the UK as a competitor. Theresa May rejected this idea, saying \"While we're members of the European Union we would expect our obligations but also our rights to be honored in full.\"\n\nThe Geographical indications and traditional specialties in the European Union, known as protected designation of origin (PDO) is applied internationally via bilateral agreements. Without an agreement with the EU27, UK producers of products such as the Cornish pasty, Scotch whisky and Jersey Royal potatoes are at risk of being copied.\n\nThe EU27 have stated that UK fish suppliers could lose tariff-free access to the continent unless EU countries have continued access to UK waters after Brexit.\n\nAgriculture\n\nThe Irish agricultural sector is heavily dependent on UK markets for its exports.\n\nInvestment banks may want to have new or expanded offices up and running inside the EU27 bloc before the UK's departure in March 2019, with Frankfurt and Dublin the possible favourites. Ireland's investment arm, IDA Ireland, witnessed an increase in inquiries from London-based financial groups considering to open up on an office in Dublin by the end of 2016, mostly coming from North American companies. In May 2017, JP Morgan became the first major bank to officially choose Dublin to transfer some of its personnel and operations from its London office.\n\nLloyd's of London have confirmed that they will open a subsidiary in Brussels, hoping to ensure continuation of their continental business which generates 11% of its premiums.\n\nThe situation may be different when it comes to the fund management industry, as British asset owners, notably UK pension funds, often constitute an incommensurate share of total turnover for German, French, Dutch and other Continental European asset managers.\n\nThis imbalance could potentially give Britain some negotiating leverage e.g. power of retorsion in case the EU attempts to impose an abrupt cancellation of the mutually-binding obligations and advantages pertaining to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004 (\"fund passporting\"). Research conducted by the World Pensions Council (WPC) shows that \n\nThe London Stock Exchange issued a warning over a proposal by the EU, to allow euro-denominated transactions to be cleared only within the EU eurozone, claiming it would increase business costs by €100bn over 5 years and isolate the euro capital market.\n\nThe letter of 29 March 2017 giving the UK's notice of intention to withdraw from the EU stated \"In security terms a failure to reach agreement would mean our cooperation in the fight against crime and terrorism would be weakened.\" This was seen by some as a threat. On 31 March, Boris Johnson, the UK Foreign Secretary, confirmed that the \"UK commitment to EU security is unconditional\".\n\nThe call by the United States to other members of NATO to increase their defence expenditure to the 2% of GDP level coincides in timing with Brexit. The UK is the second largest contributor to NATO defence, one of only five to meet the 2% level and one of only two EU members who have nuclear weapons. The possibility of a new Franco-German partnership to fill the vacuum left by Britain has been raised as a possibility and post Brexit an EU military headquarters, previously vetoed by the UK, may be created. The UK is fully committed to NATO.\n\nThe UK government's negotiating policy when the negotiating period started on 29 March 2017 included remaining at the vanguard of science and innovation, and seeking continued close collaboration with the UK's European partners.\n\nIn the Great Repeal Bill white paper published on 30 March 2017, the UK government stated \"The Government is committed to engaging with the Crown Dependencies, Gibraltar and the other Overseas Territories as we leave the EU.\"\n\nRobin Walker MP, a junior minister at the Department for Exiting the European Union, is responsible for managing the relationship between the overseas territories and Parliament in their discussion with the EU27.\n\nBrexit raised issues around sovereignty for Gibraltar, the only British Overseas Territory in the EU. Gibraltarians voted to stay in the European Union by 96%. Spain claims sovereignty over Gibraltar; however, in 2002 Gibraltarians voted 99% to keep British sovereignty.\n\nThe EU27 draft guidelines allow Spain a veto over any effect that the Brexit agreement has as regards Gibraltar. The guidelines state: \"After the United Kingdom leaves the Union, no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom.\"\n\nThe Crown dependencies are neither part of the EU nor of the UK. They have a unique constitutional relationship both with the UK and, as encapsulated in Protocol 3 to the UK's Treaty of Accession, with the EU. They have no voting rights in EU or UK referenda or elections and no international voice, the UK government having the responsibility to act for the dependencies on foreign matters. Oliver Heald QC MP is responsible for managing the relationship between the Islands and Parliament in their discussion with the EU27.\n\nIf no withdrawal agreement is in place on 30 March 2019 at midnight (European central time) or at 23h on 29 March (British time) (the end of the two-year period under Article 50) the EU Treaties will cease to apply to the UK. It is understood that, should there be \"no deal\", there will be no transition period and EU law (in particular, the Single Market) will cease to apply to the UK/EU relationship from that date. However, the EU would prefer a Brexit with an agreed deal rather than with no deal. Nonetheless, even in the case of a no withdrawal deal, the Commission believes that UK and EU may soon relaunch trade negotiations.\n\nA Parliamentary inquiry has concluded that \"the possibility of 'no deal' is real enough to justify planning for it. The Government has produced no evidence, either to this inquiry or in its White Paper, to indicate that it is giving the possibility of 'no deal' the level of consideration that it deserves, or is contemplating any serious contingency planning. This is all the more urgent if the Government is serious in its assertion that it will walk away from a 'bad' deal.\"\n\nThe UK government has consistently said that it will aim for the \"best possible deal\" but that \"no deal is better than a bad deal\". This position was restated in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 2017 general election. In July, Michel Barnier said that \"a fair deal is better than no deal\", because \"In the case of Brexit, 'no deal' is a return to a distant past\".\n\nAccording to the French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, \"The more we think the worst should be avoided, the more we think it's not impossible it could eventually happen\".\n\nWith the British (UK) white paper, both sides are wondering if the \"no deal scenario\" is more likely rather than possible.\n\nA \"no-deal\" Brexit has been described by General Council of the Bar, a lawyers' interest body, as \"falling over the cliff-edge\". According to the IMF, the no deal Brexit could create economic pain across Europe, with no winner. The most affected country would be UK, according to the IMF: the IMF consider that UK and Ireland could lose 4% of their GDP, while close countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium could lose 1% of GDP.\n\nIn September 2017 the BBC reported that there was little evidence of UK government preparations for a \"No Deal\" scenario: \"our government is not behaving like it is really preparing for No Deal – and the EU27 can surely see it.\"\n\nIn her 4 October 2017 speech at the Conservative Party Conference, UK Prime Minister Theresa May repeated her position that \"no deal is better than a bad deal\" and emphasized that \"It is our responsibility as a government to prepare for every eventuality. And let me reassure everyone in this hall – that is exactly what we are doing.\" In her 9 October 2017 statement in the House of Commons, May warned that Britain could operate as an \"independent trading nation\" after Brexit if no trade deal is reached with the EU.\n\nThe \"no deal\" scenario has been described by Nick Timothy as leaving the EU [with Britain] in \"chaos\" or not leaving the bloc at all, which he says would be a \"national humiliation\" on a par with the Suez Crisis.\n\nSir Martin Donnelly feels that no deal would be dangerous: while no deal makes trade only dependent on World Trade Organisation terms which do not include services—80% of the British economy—he believes that no deal \"could mean an awful lot of legal uncertainty and that's very bad for businesses, for jobs, for investment in Britain\".\n\nIn the Scottish Centre on European Relations paper \"Brexit Uncertainty, Scotland and the UK in 2018\", a conclusion is reached that the delivery of a no deal Brexit could raise support for a second independence referendum in Scotland.\n\nNonetheless, according to Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell there are enough people in the House of Commons to prevent some no-agreement exit.\n\nAccording to Dominic Cummings, campaign director of Vote Leave, \"If there's no deal, there will be significant problems that were completely avoidable\".\n\nAviation would be particularly affected if the European Common Aviation Area and EU–US Open Skies Agreement no longer applied to the UK after a \"no-deal\" Brexit, since World Trade Organisation rules do not cover that sector, implying that the following day a British plane could not land at an EU airport. UK government said in September 2018 that in case of no deal on aviation, UK would allow EU airlines to use British airports anyway, and expect EU countries to reciprocate.\n\nThe \"no deal scenario\" could create a disruption in transport between the United Kingdom and the European Union: for instance, with delays generated by the customs, sanitary and phytosanitary controls for road transport and ports.\n\nThe National Police Coordination Centre has warned that no deal would result in civil disorder at the UK's ports and borders, a \"real possibility\" of calling upon military assistance, a rise in crime (particularly theft and robbery) and widespread illness and disease following food and drug shortages (including NHS supplies). Police officers who are EU nationals may potentially be unable to hold a warrant card (which would leave the Metropolitan Police 750 officers short), and the ability for the police to deal with criminality from non-UK residents would be undermined as the UK \"falls out of the various treaties such as the European arrest warrant, Schengen information system and membership of Europol\". Sara Thornton of the NPCC said, \"Existing EU tools allow us to respond quickly and intelligently to crime and terrorism in the UK and the EU – they make us better at protecting the public. The alternatives we are planning to use, where they exist, are without exception slower, more bureaucratic and ultimately less effective.\" Finding out if a suspect has criminal convitions will take much longer.\n\nAn EU document on \"Preparedness\" outlines the plans related to various issues (with or without withdrawal agreement), and another on \"Contingency\" describes measures to answer the consequences of a \"No deal\".\n\nTo answer the consequences of a no deal Brexit, some players are involved in contingency planning and preparedness (but not panic).\n\nTo limit the consequences of a \"no deal\" scenario, some companies, such as Airbus and Rolls-Royce, are stockpiling spares.\n\nIn the Netherlands, around 1,000 customs officials are being recruited to manage the border with UK after the no deal Brexit.\n\nIn the UK the need for new customs agents is estimated at 5,000.\n\nIn Ireland, the need for new customs agents is estimated at 1,000.\n\nThe UK is considering converting some part of the M20 motorway into a parking lot for trucks, to manage a possible 17-mile (around 25-kilometer) line of traffic, as planned by the Dover port authority.\n\nDominic Raab's department is preparing public detailed plans to make the UK to deal with a no deal scenario for 29 March 2019.\n\nThe EU Commission has published 68 notices to help various players to be aware of the Brexit consequences.\n\nThe EU Commission is also considering notifying its international partners for international agreements that involved the UK as a member state, in case of no deal.\n\nThe UK Treasury department is using the name \"Operation Yellowhammer\" for no-deal contingency planning.\n\nThe UK side has called for a deep and special relationship between UK and EU.\n\nMost of the major UK political parties support the idea of a two-year period for applying temporary trade arrangements after the end of the membership of the EU single market, customs union and other EU agreements and before a stand-alone UK.\n\nAccording to Michel Barnier, the EU might have to define the conditions for a transitional period, if the UK requests one.\nSuch a transition period would begin on 30 March 2019 (European time, as Brexit occurs at midnight the day before).\n\nAccording to Michel Barnier, the transition period is subject to a withdrawal agreement, by law written in Article 50.\n\nWhile negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union were in progress, Barnier, as the EU's chief negotiator, speaking in Rome to Committees of the Italian Parliament on 21 September 2017, stated that a future trade deal with the United Kingdom is the trade deal which will be negotiated after sufficient progress has been made on the withdrawal deal. Barnier commented that the EU will want to negotiate a future trade deal with the United Kingdom, because trade with the United Kingdom will continue. At the same time Barnier said \"the future trade deal with the United Kingdom will be particular, as it will be less about building convergence, and more about controlling future divergence. This is key to establishing fair competition.\"\n\nThe United Kingdom's prime minister, in a speech at the Santa Maria Novella church in Florence on 22 September 2017, proposed an economic partnership between the UK and the EU which respects both the freedoms and principles of the EU, and the wishes of the British people. At the same time she re-affirmed that after the UK leaves the EU a period of implementation would be in their mutual interest, to be agreed under Article 50 for a strictly time-limited period.\n\nThe European parliament voted a Brexit resolution (the European Parliament resolution of 14 March 2018 on the framework of the future EU-UK relationship (2018/2573(RSP)) with 544 MEP against 110 (with 51 abstentions). The 14 page document states that an association agreement between EU and UK could be an adequate framework for the future. This resolution proposes that the agreement address four domains: trade, interior security, foreign and defense policy collaboration, and thematic cooperation (for instance for research and innovation).\nThe resolution also urges the UK to present a clear position on all outstanding issues pertaining to its orderly withdrawal.\n\nOn 13 November 2018, the UK and EU reached an agreement on the wording of the trade deal. On 14 November 2018, May's Cabinet approved the draft agreement. Shortly after it was approved by the British Cabinet, the European Commission published the 585 pages draft withdrawal agreement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "868738", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=868738", "title": "Burgundian School", "text": "Burgundian School\n\nThe Burgundian School was a group of composers active in the 15th century in what is now northern and eastern France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, centered on the court of the Dukes of Burgundy.\n\nThe main names associated with this school are Guillaume Dufay, Gilles Binchois, Antoine Busnois and (as an influence), the English composer John Dunstaple. The Burgundian School was the first phase of activity of the Franco-Flemish School, the central musical practice of the Renaissance in Europe.\n\nIn late Medieval and early Renaissance Europe, cultural centers tended to move from one place to another due to changing political stability and the presence of either the spiritual or temporal power, for instance the Pope, Anti-pope or the Holy Roman Emperor. In the 14th century, the main centers of musical activity were northern France, Avignon, and Italy, as represented by Guillaume de Machaut and the \"ars nova\", the \"ars subtilior\", and Landini respectively; Avignon had a brief but important cultural flowering because it was the location of the Papacy during the Western Schism. When France was ravaged by the Hundred Years' War (1337–1453), the cultural center migrated farther east, to towns in Burgundy and the Low Countries, known then collectively as the Netherlands.\n\nDuring the reign of the House of Valois, Burgundy was the most powerful and stable political division in western Europe, and added, a bit at a time, Flanders, Brabant, Holland, Luxembourg, Alsace and Lorraine. Especially during the reigns of Philip the Good (1419 – 1467) and Charles the Bold (1467 – 1477), this entire area, loosely known as Burgundy, was a center of musical creativity. Most of the musical activity did not take place in what is modern-day Burgundy, which has its capital in Dijon (even though the Dukes of Burgundy maintained an administrative center there). The main centers of music-making were Brussels, Bruges, Lille, and Arras, as well as smaller towns in that same general area.\n\nMusicians from the region came to Burgundy to study and further their own careers as the reputation of the area spread. The Burgundian rulers were not merely patrons of the arts, but took an active part: Charles the Bold himself played the harp, and composed chansons and motets (although none have survived with reliable attribution). The worldly dukes also encouraged the composition of secular music to a degree seen only rarely before in European music history, a characteristic which itself defines the Burgundian epoch as a Renaissance phenomenon.\n\nThis migration of musical culture east from Paris to Burgundy also corresponds with the conventional (and by no means universally accepted) division of music history into Medieval and Renaissance; while Guillaume de Machaut is often considered to be one of the last Medieval composers, Dufay is often considered to be the first significant Renaissance composer.\n\nCharles the Bold was killed in 1477 in the Battle of Nancy, during one of his attempts to add territory to his empire. After his death, music continued to flourish as before, but the region was split politically, with the duchy of Burgundy being absorbed into France, and most of the Low Countries becoming part of the holdings of the Spanish Habsburgs. Both the French court and the Habsburgs were patrons of music; however a French style began to diverge from that of the Low Countries, especially in secular music, and in the period after 1500.\n\nThe history of Burgundian music began with the organization of the chapel in 1384; twenty years later, it rivaled the famous establishment at Avignon in splendor. Names associated with this early phase of Burgundian music include Johannes Tapissier and Nicolas Grenon, who carried the tradition across to the next phase of the chapel, when it was reorganized in 1415. Other early composers there were Hugo and Arnold de Lantins, both of whom Dufay later met in Italy.\n\nOf all the names associated with the Burgundian School, the most famous was Guillaume Dufay, who was probably the most famous composer in Europe in the 15th century. He wrote music in many of the forms which were current, music which was melodic, singable and memorable (more than half of his sacred music consists of simple harmonizations of plainsong, for example). Contemporary with Dufay were composers such as Gilles Binchois, who was at the Burgundian court between approximately 1430 and 1460, and Hayne van Ghizeghem, a composer, singer and soldier who may have been killed in the last military campaign of Charles the Bold.\n\nAfter the death of Dufay in 1474, the most prominent Burgundian musician was Antoine Busnois, who was also a prolific composer of chansons, and who possibly wrote the famous L'homme armé tune.\n\nBurgundian composers favored secular forms, at least while they worked in Burgundian lands; much sacred music survives, especially from those composers who spent time in Italy, for example in the papal choir. The most prominent secular forms used by the Burgundians were the four \"formes fixes\" (rondeau, ballade, virelai, and bergerette), all generically known as chansons. Of the four, the rondeau was by far the most popular; at any rate more rondeaux have survived than any other form. Most of the rondeaux were in three voices, and in French, though there are a few in other languages. In most of the rondeaux, the uppermost voice (the \"superius\") was texted, and the other voices were most likely played by instruments. The bergerette was developed by the Burgundians themselves; it was like a virelai, but shorter, having only one stanza.\n\nMost of the composers also wrote sacred music in Latin; this was to remain true for the next several generations. They wrote both masses and motets, as well as cycles of Magnificats. During the period, the mass transformed from a group of individual sections written by different composers, often using a head-motif technique, to unified cycles based on a cantus firmus. Dufay, Binchois, Busnois, Reginald Liebert and others all wrote cyclic masses. One of the favorite tunes used as a cantus firmus was the renowned l'homme armé, which was set not only by the Burgundians but by composers of subsequent centuries; indeed it was commonest tune used as a basis for mass composition in all of music history, with more than forty surviving masses featuring the melody. David Fallows writes of it in the New Grove: \"It is hard to think of any other melody in the history of music that has yielded so much music of the highest quality.\"\n\nDuring the period the motet transformed from the isorhythmic model of the 14th century to the smoothly polyphonic, sectional composition seen in the work of the later Burgundians such as Busnois. In the motets, as well as the masses and other sacred music, a common musical technique employed was fauxbourdon, a harmonization of an existing chant in parallel 6-3 chords, occasionally ornamented to prevent monotony. Composition using fauxbourdon allowed sung text to be clearly understood, but yet avoided the plainness of simple chant. Burgundian motets tended to be in Latin, written for three voices with the top voice being the most important. An example of a Burgundian motet is \"Quam pulchra es\", written by Dunstaple in the early 15th century.\n\nInstrumental music was also cultivated at the Burgundian courts, often for dancing. A peculiarity of the Burgundian instrumental style is that the dukes preferred music for loud instruments (trumpets, tambourins, shawms, bagpipes) and more of this survives than for other current instruments such as the lute or the harp. In contemporary practice, the loud instruments would usually play from an elevated location, such as a balcony, while the other instruments would play closer to the dancers.\n\nInstrumental forms included the \"basse danse\", or \"bassadanza\", which was a ceremonial dance of a rather dignified character, and relatively slow tempo. Typically it was in a duple meter subdivided into threes (in modern notation, 6/8), and often the dance would be immediately followed by a quick dance, the \"tordion\" or \"pas de Brabant\".\n\nThe Burgundian School was the first generation of what is sometimes known as the Netherlands School, several generations of composers spanning 150 years who composed in the polyphonic style associated with the mainstream of Renaissance practice. Later generations, which were no longer specifically associated with either the court or the region Burgundy but were interlinked by adjacent geography and by common musical practice, included such names as Johannes Ockeghem, Jacob Obrecht, Josquin des Prez, Adrian Willaert and Orlandus Lassus.\n\nThere are approximately 65 manuscript sources which contain music by Burgundian composers. The most prominent of these include:\n\n\n"}

As a result, the Dengvaxia controversy, or Dengvaxia mess, began to emerge following the reports of several children dying from various complications allegedly attributed to the dengue vaccine.\n\nIn April 2016, the Department of Health (DOH), launched the dengue vaccination campaign in regions Central Luzon, Calabarzon and Metro Manila, where about 700,000 individuals received at least one dose of the vaccine. The government paid P3.5-billion for the vaccine. On December 1, 2015, former President Benigno Aquino III met with executives of Sanofi Pasteur in a courtesy call in Paris, making the Philippines the first Asian country to approve the commercial sale of Dengvaxia.\n\nFollowing the attempt by the dengue vaccination maker Sanofi Pasteur on November 29, 2017, the Philippine Department of Health (DOH) suspended the vaccination program based in schools owing to the concern that it worsens the disease in some cases where the recipient had no previous exposure. DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III said \"In the light of this new analysis, the DOH will place the dengue vaccination on hold while review and consultation is ongoing with experts, key stakeholders and the World Health Organization.\" On December 2, 2017, the government of Makati immediately suspended its anti-dengue vaccination drive following its statement.\n\nIn its statement, pharmaceutical company Sanofi Pasteur reported concerns that Filipinos, mostly schoolchildren, could be potentially be at risk of a more severe disease, where the recipient of the vaccine had not had a previous dengue infection. On December 4, 2017, Sanofi denied that they made Filipinos into “guinea pigs”, explaining that the vaccine program was conducted by the DOH, not Sanofi. Dr Ruby Dizon, a medical director of Sanofi, said that the dengue vaccination would not cause \"severe dengue\". Senator JV Ejercito, chair of the Senate Committee on Health and Demography, is seeking to identify by January 2018 whether there was an irregularity in the procurement of the vaccine. Senator Risa Hontiveros urged the government to address the health threats posed by the vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines ordered Sanofi to stop distributing of Dengvaxia into the country. Former Health Secretary Janette Garin said she welcomed the investigation which will be conducted by the Philippine Department of Justice. Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque told the media that 10 percent of the 733,000 schoolchildren were at risk of dengue infection. Since then, the Philippine Department of Education has closely monitored the students who have been injected by the vaccine. Hontiveros said that Sanofi should take liability for the medical expenses of those who contracted severe dengue fever after receiving doses of the vaccine.\n\nSanofi representative Thomas Triomphe \"was forced to apologize\" during the House of Representatives hearing on the Dengvaxia dengue vaccine. Former President Benigno Aquino III, who approved the vaccination program in 2016, expressed interest on attending the Senate hearing. On December 16, Aquino told reporters that \"With the announcement of Sanofi and the reactions to it, there has been a lot of tension building up and I think it is incumbent upon me even as a citizen to try and allay certain fears, to put it in the proper perspective, to put it on the proper level\".\n\nSecretary Duque reminded the public, especially parents, that \"the vaccine is not a 'standalone' preventive measure against dengue.\" On December 15, 2017, former Education and Skills Development chief Augusto Syjuco Jr filed \"mass murder and plunder\" complaints against Aquino and former health secretary Janette Garin over the controversial vaccination program. Former health secretary Enrique Ona blamed his successor Janette Garin, who advised former president Benigno Aquino lll to purchase the Dengvaxia.\n\nOn February 2, 2018, the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) issued a report stating that three out of 14 children who died after receiving Dengvaxia had an indication of dengue despite immunization. On February 3, a group of doctors, including former health secretary Esperanza Cabral, urged the Public Attorney's Office (PAO) to stop conducting autopsies. On February 21, Senator Richard Gordon said that the DOH must be liable for the controversy. On March 13, Senator Gordon formally terminated the investigation of the controversy. On February 26, Aquino appeared for the first time at House inquiry about the controversy; he said that the controversy has been \"politicized\", but the Malacañang Palace distanced itself from Aquino's allegations. On February 27, the opposition Representatives such as Gary Alejano of Magdalo and Edcel Lagman of Albay urged President Rodrigo Duterte to intervene about the dispute between the PAO and DOH. On March 3, about 200 families of Dengvaxia vacinees joined the advocacy run held in Quezon Memorial Circle.\n\nSanofi stated that they will make a decision on seeking regulatory approval for dengue vaccine Dengvaxia in the United States, despite the health scare in the country, after they have had a meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration.\n\nOn April 5, Public Attorney’s Office filed the criminal charges (reckless imprudence resulting in homicide under Article 365 of the Revised Penal Code and violation of Republic Act No. 9745 (Anti-Torture Act) and torture) against the Former Health Secretary Janette Garin and other former officials. However, Garin said that the charges have no basis and vowed to file a counter-charge against PAO. The families of four children — Aejay Bautista (11), Lenard Baldonado (10), Zandro Colite (11), and Angelica Pestilos (10), whose deaths had been linked to Dengvaxia — also filed the charges.\n\nOn April 19, PAO filed criminal complaints before the Department of Justice (DOJ), including the incumbent Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, following the death of the 13-year-old girl after receiving Dengvaxia on November 17, 2017. Duque fires back by describing the charges against him as \"malicious and oppressive\" and he also said that he has nothing to do with the implementation of the dengue immunization program since he was seated as the secretary last October 2017.\n\nOn April 11, Gordon released his draft report, stating that Aquino is guilty of \"malfeasance, misfeasance and nonfeasance\" in connection to that controversy. The blue ribbon committee also told Aquino for \"simply not caring\" because the lives of Filipino children in grave danger. Gordon said that Aquino, former Budget Secretary Florencio Abad, Garin and other conspirators must be prosecuted for the Dengvaxia mess. Gordon slammed Aquino by saying that \"he's insensitive and lacks compassion.\" However, left-wing figures called Gordon’s report “one-sided,” and Senator Antonio Trillanes IV defends Aquino by saying that Gordon's report was \"black propaganda\". Aquino reacted by saying, “What should we expect from the Dick Gordon show?”. Also, Senator Ejercito said that while Aquino is \"guilty of negligence\", Garin and Abad are the ones who should be held liable. \n\nOn April 15, Gordon said he expected at least 10 senators to sign his report holding former President Benigno Aquino III and other officials liable. Senator Panfilo Lacson will not sign the report due to \"unreasonable comments\" about him. On April 17, Aside from Gordon, who already signed the report, Senators Ralph Recto, Manny Pacquiao, Sherwin Gatchalian, Tito Sotto, Gregorio Honasan, Juan Miguel Zubiri, JV Ejercito, Nancy Binay, and Grace Poe have signed. On April 20, Senator Sonny Angara also signed.\n\nSince the announcement by Sanofi, at least 65 children have died , allegedly after receiving a vaccination. The victims' parents blamed the dengue vaccine for the deaths of their children. Most of the deaths are caused by internal bleedings in heart, lungs, and brain based on the autopsy conducted by PAO. Duque angrily confronted the summoned hospital officials after he learned that four hospitals in Cavite allegedly refused to admit the Dengvaxia vaccinees because \"there is no room for the patient\".\n\nNetizens, as well as Senator Ejercito, expressed frustration on February 5, blaming the PAO for panic in dengue vaccination. Attorney Persida Acosta of the PAO said that the PAO should not be blamed for that panic but Sanofi Pasteur itself.\n\n"}

It grew out of the SHARE (\"Society to Help Avoid Redundant Effort\") design automation workshop. Its originators Marie Pistilli and Pasquale (Pat) Pistilli were honored by the EDA community. Pat received the highest honor in EDA industry, the Phil Kaufman Award, for this effort and Marie was honored by having an award established in her name, Marie R. Pistilli Women in EDA Achievement Award, known as the Marie R. Pistilli Women in Engineering Achievement Award since 2016.\n\nUp until the mid-'70s, DAC had sessions on all types of design automation, including mechanical and architectural. After that, for all intents and purposes, only topics concerned with electronic design have been included. Also until the mid-'70s, DAC was strictly a technical conference. Then a few companies started to request space to show their products, and within a few years the trade show portion of DAC became the main focus of the event. The first commercial DAC was held in June 1984. As a rough metric of the importance of the trade show portion, about 5,500 people attended DAC in 2005, whereas ICCAD, at least as strong technically but with no trade show, drew perhaps a tenth as many attendees.\n\nOther similar conferences are the International Conference on Computer-Aided Design, or ICCAD (technical only, no trade show), Design Automation and Test in Europe (DATE), Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASPDAC), and International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design (ISQED).\n\nOver the past few years the conference location has been alternating among San Diego, Austin, Anaheim, and San Francisco. The conference is usually held in June.\n\nDAC is sponsored by several professional societies: ACM-SIGDA (Association for Computing Machinery, Special Interest Group on Design Automation), ESD Alliance(Electronic System Design Alliance), and IEEE-CEDA (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation), in technical cooperation with IEEE-SSCS (IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society).

It is one of two annual state fairs in Idaho; the other is the Western Idaho Fair, which is held in Boise, the state capital. The gates to the fairgrounds open on Labor Day weekend, the first week in September.\n\nIn 1902 some cattle ranchers had purchased some land in hopes of putting on a livestock show. The show was given the name \"Southeastern Idaho Fair\".\n\nWhen financial hardships hit the fair in 1918, it was suspended until 1920. The state legislators passed a Fair District Bill in 1925. The fair started out as a district fair with livestock and entertainment. After being challenged by the Utah State Fair, the officials decided to change the name of the event from \"Eastern Idaho Fair\" to \"Eastern Idaho State Fair\". In 1925, the fair ran for four days.\n\nThe fair was shut down in July 1942, after the United States entered World War II, and the buildings at the fairground were used for storage of surplus. On December 10, a fire destroyed the commercial buildings consuming potatoes and coal. In 1942, the Fair housed some 500 Italian prisoners, who were ordered to dig sugar beets and potatoes. Operations have continued since 1944.The Native Americans of Fort Hall have also influenced the Eastern Idaho State Fair: an Indian Relay Race has been held throughout the fair's history.The state fair has been used to promote local agriculture throughout its history, with area farmers displaying their produce and livestock to the public.\n\n2017 marked the 115 year anniversary for the fair. It set an attendance record of 239,103 which broke the previous record set in 2016.\n\nOne of the events held at the opening of the fair is the annual parade held in Blackfoot. The parade starts at the south end of Shilling Avenue and makes its way to the north end. Several local clubs and organizations, as well as representatives from local high schools, police department, fire department, businesses and dance teams, participate in the line of the parade. The parade is escorted by the local police department and fire department, sounding their horns and sirens. Local high schools, cheerleading squads, student council, Junior Miss winners, dance team and some clubs have their own floats. The people on these floats cheer, throw candy, and promote the fair. Businesses around town are in the parade with music, candy, and brochures advertising their business. The dance teams advertise their team, but and entertain the crowd by doing a dance while walking down the road.\n\nChinese, Japanese, Mexican, American, and Indian food is sold at the fair, including teriyaki bowls, tiger ears, scone nuggets, turkey legs, hamburgers, funnel cakes, curly fries, ice cream, and Dutch oven cooking.\n\nWeekdays at the grandstands, horse races are held from noon until about late afternoon.\n\nAfter every few heats, the Indian relays are held. The Native American tribes have three horses each, which are taken for three laps around the track. In order to use every horse each tribe has to do a switch after taking one lap, and the man on the horse does not wait until the horse is at a dead halt. The participants in the race jump off the horse while horse is slowing down, then run and jump onto the next horse. Those who fail to jump correctly get far behind the other teams. The horses from which they jump are sometimes unable to slow down in time, and trample the rider. Many people participate in gambling on the race.\n\nNight time events include motocross, bull riding, rodeo, tractor pulls, concerts, and a demolition derby. The concerts change every year, with different genres and performers. The 2015 edition of the fair features Gabriel Iglesias and Cheap Trick as headline performers.\n\nOn two other small stages, smaller events take place. Some of the smaller events include hypnotists, arm wrestling contests, \"Idaho Idol\" (sponsored by KFTZ \"Z-103.FM\"), local dance teams, singing, and comedy shows. Other events surrounding the stage include a petting zoo, camp trailers, and a reptile show.\n\nFairground rides and games are operated at the show, including child rides and adult rides, including the Zipper, Fun Slide, House of Mirrors, and trucks that go around on a track. Tickets and wristbands are sold to the rides and the games. The rides are provided by Butler Amusements.\n\nAnimals displayed at the fair include dairy and beef cattle, different types and breeds of horses, sheep, pigs, goats, chicken, rabbits, and ostriches. The public is allowed to showcase their livestock for the 4H program.\n\nBuildings on the fairgrounds include agricultural information, advertising of hot tubs, trailers, fireplaces, siding for houses, and others. The smaller buildings may contain craft items. Blankets, handmade clothes, and other stitching work is displayed, along with photography of animals, nature, children, weddings, families, senior pictures, and other subjects.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22309437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22309437", "title": "FIA GT1 World Championship", "text": "FIA GT1 World Championship\n\nThe FIA GT1 World Championship was a world championship sports car racing series developed by the SRO Group and regulated by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), held from 2010 to 2012. It featured multiple grand tourer race cars based on production road cars and conforming with the GT1 (2010–2011) and GT3 (2012) regulations competing in one-hour races on multiple continents. All cars were performance balanced with weight and restrictor adjustments to artificially equalise their performance. Championships were awarded each season for drivers and teams.\n\nThe FIA GT1 World Championship started in 2010 as a successor to the FIA GT Championship which had featured the GT1 category as well as a GT2 category. In 2012 the series originally planned to move away from exclusive use of GT1 cars by allowing 2009-spec GT2 from the former FIA GT Championship as well as current performance balanced GT3 specification cars to compete alongside the series' current GT1 cars. However, as there were no interested GT2 teams and only a handful of former GT1 runners were willing to participate, the SRO decided that the 2012 season would be contested with GT3-spec cars only (yet retaining GT1 in the series' title). The series folded after the 2012 season due to the high costs, shrinking car counts and issues with the calendar, and morphed into the FIA GT Series for 2013.\n\nThe FIA GT1 World Championship held races in ten countries, with each event consisting of two races over a weekend. Qualifying involved a knock-out system similar to Formula One, in which three sessions were held and following each session, the slowest cars were eliminated and their grid positions set. The first race of each weekend was a qualifying race, the results of which determined the starting grid for a second race awarding full championship points. Each car was required to change tires and drivers at least once during each race. The points system for the series was identical to that adopted by the FIA in 2010 with the top ten finishers in the second race earning points; only the top three finishers in the qualifying race earned points.\n\nThe series penalized cars which won races with Ballast weight, but that practice was removed for 2012. With rules changes in 2012, there were no limit to the number of manufacturers in the series. Each manufacturer could only be represented by one team, and each team was required to bring two identical cars to enter the championship; single entries or entries with more than two cars were not allowed. To ensure close competition, each model of car was tested by the FIA to determine any mandatory adjustments (such as extra weight ballasts and restrictor tweaks) for performance balancing. Performance adjustments were also made between races during the season.\n\nTo defray costs for individual teams, the SRO provided free transport for cars and equipment as well as airline tickets for ten personnel per team.\n\nThe world tour visited three continents: Europe, Asia and South America. Yas Marina Circuit of the United Arab Emirates represented the series' only Middle East round. South America featured the Potrero de los Funes Circuit in Argentina and Interlagos in Brazil. European races included the Czech Brno Circuit, British Silverstone Circuit where the winners were awarded the RAC Tourist Trophy, French Paul Ricard, Portuguese Autódromo Internacional do Algarve, and Spanish Circuito de Navarra. Germany's races switched from the Nürburgring to the Sachsenring from 2010 to 2011, while Belgium's races moved from the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps to Zolder. For 2011 the series visited Asia with a Chinese round at the Ordos International Circuit. Due to the cancellation of the round at Curitiba in 2011, the series elected to visit Goldenport Park Circuit at Beijing shortly after the round at Ordos, with a short exhibition street race afterwards.\n\nSix manufacturers were represented in the inaugural season of FIA GT1, with Chevrolet, Maserati, and Aston Martin retaining the grandfathered Corvette C6. R, MC12, and DBR9 cars they had respectively utilized in the FIA GT series. Ford, Nissan, and Lamborghini all brought new or modified vehicles developed specifically for FIA GT1; the Ford GT1, Nissan GT-R, and Lamborghini Murciélago R-GT.\n\nThe champions of the 2010 season were crowned at the San Luis street circuit in Argentina after the Qualifying Race on 5 December 2010. Michael Bartels and Andrea Bertolini, three-time FIA GT Champions, clinched the Drivers' Championship while their Vitaphone Racing Team clinched the Teams' Championship. Aston Martin earned the SRO Trophy for Manufacturers. In 2011 the defending champions did not return and Maserati was no longer represented, leaving a field of 18 cars from five manufacturers. The series visited China for the first time for two rounds. Germans Michael Krumm and Lucas Luhr of the JR Motorsports team won the year's Drivers' Championship in the penultimate race of the season, while Hexis AMR (Aston Martin) won the Teams' title in the final race of the year.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4488176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4488176", "title": "Factitious disorder imposed on another", "text": "Factitious disorder imposed on another\n\nFactitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA or FDIoA), also known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSbP), is a condition derived from Munchausen syndrome, a psychiatric factitious disorder wherein those affected feign disease, illness, or psychological trauma to draw attention, sympathy, or reassurance to themselves. However, unlike Munchausen syndrome, in MSbP, the deception involves not themselves, but rather someone under the person's care. MSbP is primarily distinguished from other forms of abuse or neglect by the motives of the perpetrator. Some experts consider it to be an elusive, potentially lethal, and frequently misunderstood form of child abuse or medical neglect. However, others consider the concept to be problematic, since it is based largely on supposition regarding a person's motives, which can be open to radically different interpretations.\n\nFactitious disorder imposed on another has also spawned much heated controversy within the legal and social services communities. In a handful of high-profile cases, mothers who have had several children die from sudden infant death syndrome have been declared to have MSbP. Based on MSbP testimony of an expert witness, they were tried for murder, convicted, and imprisoned for several years. In some cases, that testimony was later impeached, resulting in exoneration of those defendants.\n\nIn factitious disorder imposed on another, a caregiver makes a dependent person appear mentally or physically ill in order to gain attention. To perpetuate the medical relationship, the caregiver systematically misrepresents symptoms, fabricates signs, manipulates laboratory tests, or even purposely harms the dependent (e.g. by poisoning, suffocation, infection, physical injury). Studies have shown a mortality rate of between 6% and 10%, making it perhaps the most lethal form of abuse.\n\nAt the time of diagnosis, the average age of the persons affected was 4 years. Slightly over 50% were aged 24 months or younger, and 75% were under 6 years old. The average duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 22 months. By the time of diagnosis, 6% of the affected persons were dead, mostly from apnea (a common result of smothering) or starvation, and 7% suffered long-term or permanent injury. About half of the affected had siblings; 25% of the known siblings were dead, and 61% of siblings had symptoms similar to the affected or that were otherwise suspicious. The mother was the perpetrator in 76.5% of the cases, the father in 6.7%.\n\nMost present about 3 medical problems in some combination of the 103 different reported symptoms. The most-frequently reported problems are apnea (26.8% of cases), anorexia or feeding problems (24.6% of cases), diarrhea (20%), seizures (17.5%), cyanosis (blue skin) (11.7%), behavior (10.4%), asthma (9.5%), allergy (9.3%), and fevers (8.6%). Other symptoms include failure to thrive, vomiting, bleeding, rash, and infections. Many of these symptoms are easy to fake because they are subjective. A parent reporting that their child had a fever in the past 24 hours is making a claim that is impossible to prove or disprove. The number and variety of presented symptoms contribute to the difficulty in reaching a proper MSbP diagnosis.\n\nAside from the motive (which is to gain attention or sympathy), another feature that differentiates MSbP from \"typical\" physical child abuse is the degree of premeditation involved. Whereas most physical abuse entails lashing out at a child in response to some behavior (e.g., crying, bedwetting, spilling food), assaults on the MSbP victim tend to be unprovoked and planned.\n\nAlso unique to this form of abuse is the role that health care providers play by actively, albeit unintentionally, enabling the abuse. By reacting to the concerns and demands of perpetrators, medical professionals are manipulated into a partnership of child maltreatment. Challenging cases that defy simple medical explanations may prompt health care providers to pursue unusual or rare diagnoses, thus allocating even more time to the child and the abuser. Even without prompting, medical professionals may be easily seduced into prescribing diagnostic tests and therapies that are at best uncomfortable and costly, and at worst potentially injurious to the child. If the health practitioner resists ordering further tests, drugs, procedures, surgeries, or specialists, the MSbP abuser makes the medical system appear negligent for refusing to help a sick child and their selfless parent. Like those with Munchausen syndrome, MSbP perpetrators are known to switch medical providers frequently until they find one that is willing to meet their level of need; this practice is known as \"doctor shopping\" or \"hospital hopping\".\n\nThe perpetrator continues the abuse because maintaining the child in the role of patient satisfies the abuser's needs. The cure for the victim is to separate the child completely from the abuser. When parental visits are allowed, sometimes there is a disastrous outcome for the child. Even when the child is removed, the perpetrator may then abuse another child: a sibling or other child in the family.\n\nFactitious disorder imposed on another can have many long-term emotional effects on a child. Depending on their experience of medical interventions, a percentage of children may learn that they are most likely to receive the positive maternal attention they crave when they are playing the sick role in front of health care providers. Several case reports describe Munchausen syndrome patients suspected of themselves having been MSbP victims. Seeking personal gratification through illness can thus become a lifelong and multi-generational disorder in some cases. In stark contrast, other reports suggest survivors of MSbP develop an avoidance of medical treatment with post-traumatic responses to it. This variation possibly reflects broad statistics on survivors of child abuse in general, where around 30% go on to also become abusers even though a significant percentage do not.\n\nThe adult care-provider who has abused the child often seems comfortable and not upset over the child's hospitalization. While the child is hospitalized, medical professionals must monitor the caregiver's visits to prevent an attempt to worsen the child's condition. In addition, in many jurisdictions, medical professionals have a duty to report such abuse to legal authorities.\n\nWarning signs of the disorder include:\n\n\nMunchausen syndrome by proxy is a controversial term. In the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), the official diagnosis is factitious disorder (301.51 in ICD-9, F68.12 in ICD-10). Within the United States, factitious disorder imposed on another (FDIA or FDIoA) was officially recognized as a disorder in 2013, while in the United Kingdom, it is known as fabricated or induced illness by carers (FII).\n\nIn DSM-5, the diagnostic manual published by the American Psychiatric Association in 2013, this disorder is listed under \"301.51 Factitious disorder\". This, in turn, encompasses two types:\n\nStill widely used, the term \"Munchausen syndrome by proxy\" has led to much confusion in the literature. In the United States, the term has never officially been included as a discrete mental disorder by the American Psychiatric Association, which publishes the widely recognized \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM), now in its fifth edition. Although the DSM-III (1980) and DSM-III-R (1987) included Munchausen Syndrome, they did \"not\" include MSbP. DSM-IV (1994) and DSM-IV-TR (2000) added MSbP as a proposal only, and finally being recognized as a disorder in DSM-5 (2013) – yet \"each\" of these last three editions of the DSM listed this disorder (or proposal) with a different name.\n\nElsewhere as well, ongoing lack of consensus has led to much confusion over terminology, and MSbP has been given many names in different places and at different times. What follows is a \"partial\" list of alternative names that have been either used or proposed (with approximate dates):\n\nThe definition of the disorder has also been subject to controversy and confusion. For example, while it initially included only the infliction of harmful medical care, the appellation has subsequently been extended to include cases in which the only harm arose from medical neglect, noncompliance, or even educational interference.\n\nMSbP is rare. A recent systematic study in Italy found that in a series of over 700 patients admitted to a pediatric ward, 4 cases met the diagnostic criteria for MSbP (0.53%). In this study, stringent diagnostic criteria were used, which required at least one test outcome or event that could not possibly have occurred without deliberate intervention by the MSbP person.\nOne study showed that in 93 percent of MSbP cases, the abuser is the mother or another female guardian or caregiver. This may be attributed to the prevalent socialization pattern that places females in the primary care-taking role. A psychodynamic model of this kind of maternal abuse exists.\n\nMSbP may be more prevalent in the parents of those with a learning difficulty or mental incapacity, and as such the apparent patient could, in fact, be an adult.\n\nFathers and other male caregivers have been the perpetrators in only 7% of the cases studied. When they are not actively involved in the abuse, the fathers or male guardians of MSbP victims are often described as being distant, emotionally disengaged, and powerless. These men play a passive role in MSbP by being frequently absent from the home and rarely visiting the hospitalized child. Usually, they vehemently deny the possibility of abuse, even in the face of overwhelming evidence or their child's pleas for help.\n\nOverall, male and female children are equally likely to be the victim of MSbP. In the few cases where the father is the perpetrator, however, the victim is three times more likely to be male.\n\nThe name \"Munchausen syndrome by proxy\" (MSbP) is derived from Munchausen syndrome, a different though related condition. People with Munchausen syndrome have a profound need to assume the sick role, and exaggerate complaints, falsify tests, or inflict illnesses on themselves directly. Munchausen syndrome by proxy perpetrators, by contrast, are willing to fulfill their need for positive attention by hurting their own child, thereby assuming the sick role onto their child, by proxy. These proxies then gain personal attention and support by taking on this fictitious \"hero role\" and receive positive attention from others, by appearing to care for and save their so-called sick child. Both are named after Baron Munchausen, a literary character based on Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (1720–1797), a German nobleman and well-known storyteller. In 1785, writer and con artist Rudolf Erich Raspe anonymously published a book in which a fictional version of \"Baron Munchausen\" tells fantastic and impossible stories about himself, establishing a popular literary archetype of a bombastic exaggerator.\n\n\"Munchausen syndrome\" was first described by R. Asher in 1951 as when someone invents or exaggerates medical symptoms, sometimes engaging in self-harm, to gain attention or sympathy.\n\nThe term \"Munchausen syndrome by proxy\" was first coined by John Money and June Faith Werlwas in a 1976 paper titled \"Folie à deux in the parents of psychosocial dwarfs: Two cases\" to describe the abuse-induced and neglect-induced symptoms of the syndrome of abuse dwarfism. That same year, Sneed and Bell wrote an article titled \"The Dauphin of Munchausen: factitious passage of renal stones in a child\".\n\nAccording to other sources, the term was created by the British pediatrician Roy Meadow in 1977. In 1977, Roy Meadow – then professor of pediatrics at the University of Leeds, England – described the extraordinary behavior of two mothers. According to Meadow, one had poisoned her toddler with excessive quantities of salt. The other had introduced her own blood into her baby's urine sample. This second case occurred during a series of Outpatient visits to the Paediatric Clinic of Dr. Bill Arrowsmith at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. He referred to this behavior as Munchausen syndrome by proxy (MSbP).\n\nThe medical community was initially skeptical of MSbP's existence, but it gradually gained acceptance as a recognized condition. There are now more than 2,000 case reports of MSbP in the professional literature. Reports come from developing countries, as well as the U.S., with one case from 2012–2013, in Orlando, Florida, and the most recent in Westchester, New York, in early 2015. Other reports come from Sri Lanka, Nigeria, and Oman.\n\nDuring the 1990s and early 2000s, Roy Meadow was an expert witness in several murder cases involving MSbP/FII. Dr. Meadow was knighted for his work for child protection, though later, his reputation, and consequently the credibility of MSbP, became severely damaged when several convictions of child killing, in which he acted as an expert witness, were overturned. The mothers in those cases were wrongly convicted of murdering two or more of their children, and had already been imprisoned for up to six years.\n\nThe pivotal case was that of Sally Clark. Clark was a lawyer wrongly convicted in 1999 of the murder of her two baby sons, largely on the basis of Meadow's evidence. As an expert witness for the prosecution, Meadow asserted that the odds of there being two unexplained infant deaths in one family were one in 73 million. That figure was crucial in sending Clark to jail but was hotly disputed by the Royal Statistical Society, who wrote to the Lord Chancellor to complain. It was subsequently shown that once other factors (e.g. genetic or environmental) were taken into consideration, the true odds were much greater, \"i.e.\", there was a significantly higher likelihood of two deaths happening as a chance occurrence than Meadow had claimed during the trial. Those odds in fact range from a low of 1:8500 to as high as 1:200. It emerged later that there was clear evidence of a \"Staphylococcus aureus\" infection that had spread as far as the child's cerebrospinal fluid. Clark was released in January 2003 after three judges quashed her convictions in the Court of Appeal in London, but suffering from catastrophic trauma of the experience, she later died from alcohol poisoning. Meadow was involved as a prosecution witness in three other high-profile cases resulting in mothers being imprisoned and subsequently cleared of wrongdoing – those of Trupti Patel, Angela Cannings, and Donna Anthony.\n\nIn 2003, Lord Howe, the Opposition spokesman on health, accused Meadow of inventing a \"theory without science\" and refusing to produce any real evidence to prove that Munchausen syndrome by proxy actually exists. It is important to distinguish between the act of harming a child, which can be easily verified, and motive, which is much harder to verify and which MSbP tries to explain. For example, a caregiver may wish to harm a child out of malice and then attempt to conceal it as illness to avoid detection of abuse, rather than to draw attention and sympathy.\n\nThe distinction is often crucial in criminal proceedings, in which the prosecutor must prove both the act and the mental element constituting a crime to establish guilt. In most legal jurisdictions, a doctor can give expert witness testimony as to whether a child was being harmed but cannot speculate regarding the motive of the caregiver. FII merely refers to the fact that illness is induced or fabricated and does not specifically limit the motives of such acts to a caregiver's need for attention and/or sympathy.\n\nIn all, around 250 cases resulting in conviction in which Meadow was an expert witness were reviewed, with few changes, but all where the only evidence was Meadows' expert testimony were over turned. Meadow was investigated by the British General Medical Council (GMC) over evidence he gave in the Sally Clark trial. In July 2005, the GMC declared Meadow guilty of \"serious professional misconduct\", and he was struck off the medical register for giving \"erroneous\" and \"misleading\" evidence.\nAt appeal, High Court judge Mr. Justice Collins said that the severity of his punishment \"approaches the irrational\" and set it aside.\n\nCollins's judgment raises important points concerning the liability of expert witnesses – his view is that referral to the GMC by the losing side is an unacceptable threat and that only the Court should decide whether its witnesses are seriously deficient and refer them to their professional bodies.\n\nIn addition to the controversy surrounding expert witnesses, an article appeared in the forensic literature that detailed legal cases involving controversy surrounding the murder suspect. The article provides a brief review of the research and criminal cases involving Munchausen syndrome by proxy in which psychopathic mothers and caregivers were the murderers. It also briefly describes the importance of gathering behavioral data, including observations of the parents who commit the criminal acts. The article references the 1997 work of Southall, Plunkett, Banks, Falkov, and Samuels, in which covert video recorders were used to monitor the hospital rooms of suspected MSbP victims. In 30 out of 39 cases, a parent was observed intentionally suffocating their child; in two they were seen attempting to poison a child; in another, the mother deliberately broke her 3-month-old daughter's arm. Upon further investigation, those 39 patients, ages 1 month to 3 years old, had 41 siblings; 12 of those had died suddenly and unexpectedly. The use of covert video, while apparently extremely effective, raises controversy in some jurisdictions over privacy rights.\n\nIn most legal jurisdictions, doctors are allowed to give evidence only in regard to whether the child is being harmed. They are not allowed to give evidence in regard to the motive. Australia and the UK have established the legal precedent that MSbP does not exist as a medico-legal entity.\n\nIn a June 2004 appeal hearing, the Supreme Court of Queensland, Australia, stated:\n\nThe Queensland Supreme Court further ruled that the determination of whether or not a defendant had caused intentional harm to a child was a matter for the jury to decide and not for the determination by expert witnesses:\n\nPrinciples of law and implications for legal processes that may be deduced from these findings are that:\n\nThe Queensland Judgment was adopted into English law in the High Court of Justice by Mr. Justice Ryder. In his final conclusions regarding Factitious Disorder, Ryder states that:\n\nIn his book \"Playing Sick\" (2004), Marc Feldman notes that such findings have been in the minority among U.S. and even Australian courts. Pediatricians and other physicians have banded together to oppose limitations on child-abuse professionals whose work includes FII detection. The April 2007 issue of the journal \"Pediatrics\" specifically mentions Meadow as an individual who has been inappropriately maligned.\n\nWendi Michelle Scott is a Frederick, Maryland mother who was charged with sickening her four-year-old daughter.\n\nThe book \"Sickened\", by Julie Gregory, details her life growing up with a mother suffering from Munchausen by proxy, who took her to various doctors, coached her to act sicker than she was and to exaggerate her symptoms, and who demanded increasingly invasive procedures to diagnose Gregory's enforced imaginary illnesses.\n\nLisa Hayden-Johnson of Devon was jailed for three years and three months after subjecting her son to a total of 325 medical actions – including being confined to a wheelchair and being fed through a tube in his stomach. She claimed her son had a long list of illnesses including diabetes, food allergies, cerebral palsy, and cystic fibrosis, describing him as \"the most ill child in Britain\" and receiving numerous cash donations and charity gifts, including two cruises.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Kathy Bush gained public sympathy for the plight of her daughter, Jennifer, who by the age of 8 had undergone 40 surgeries and spent over 640 days in hospitals for gastrointestinal disorders. The acclaim led to a visit with first lady Hillary Clinton, who championed the Bushs' plight as evidence of need for medical reform. However, in 1996, Kathy Bush was arrested and charged with child abuse and Medicaid fraud, accused of sabotaging Jennifer's medical equipment and drugs to agitate and prolong her illness. Jennifer was moved to foster care where she quickly regained her health. The prosecutors claimed Kathy was driven by Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy, and she was convicted to a five-year sentence in 1999. Kathy was released after serving three years in 2005, always maintaining her innocence, and having got back in contact with Jennifer via correspondence.\n\nIn 2014, 26-year-old Lacey Spears was charged in Westchester County, New York, with second-degree depraved murder and first-degree manslaughter. She allegedly fed her son dangerous amounts of salt after she conducted research on the Internet about its effects. Her actions were allegedly motivated by the social media attention she gained on Facebook, Twitter, and blogs. She was convicted of second-degree murder on March 2, 2015, and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.\n\nDee Dee Blancharde was a Missouri mother who was murdered by her daughter and a boyfriend after having claimed, for years, that her daughter, Gypsy Rose, was sick and disabled, to the point of shaving her head, making her use a wheelchair in public, and subjecting her to unnecessary medication and surgery. Feldman said that it is the first case he is aware of in a quarter-century of research where the victim killed the abuser. Their story was shown on HBO's documentary film \"Mommy Dead and Dearest\".\n\nMunchausen syndrome by proxy plays a key role in Gillian Flynn's 2006 debut novel, \"Sharp Objects\", and its 2018 HBO TV miniseries adaptation.\n\nMunchausen syndrome by proxy is central to the background of the main protagonist, Saga Norén (played by Sofia Helin), the lead homicide detective in Malmö, in the Danish/Swedish TV series \"The Bridge\" (2011). In the series, Saga's mother suffers from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, abusing Saga and her younger sister Jennifer, who commits suicide at age 14 due to the abuse. The consequences and long-term, wide-ranging effects of the condition on the victims are explored in depth, especially in the third and fourth (final) seasons.\n\nIn Episode 6, \"A Man's Price\", in the American television crime drama \"True Detective\" (2014), detective Rustin Cohle (played by Matthew McConaughey) confronts a woman in custody and questions her actions revolving around her child's recent death in her care, as evidence suggests her behavior is indicative of this disorder.\n\nMadeline Whittier, the protagonist in the 2015 book \"Everything, Everything\" and its 2017 film adaptation, is a victim of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, her mother raising her to believe she suffers from severe combined immunodeficiency.\n\nThe film \"The 9th Life of Louis Drax\" (2016) deals with the Munchausen syndrome by proxy.\n\nMedical literature describes a subset of MSbP caregivers, where the proxy is a pet rather than another person. These cases are labeled Munchausen syndrome by proxy: pet (MSbP:P). In these cases, pet owners correspond to caregivers in traditional MSbP presentations involving human proxies. No extensive survey has yet been made of the extant literature, and there has been no speculation as to how closely MSbP:P tracks with human MSbP.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "216590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216590", "title": "Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez", "text": "Female homicides in Ciudad Juárez\n\nThe phenomenon of the female homicides in Ciudad Juárez, called in Spanish feminicidio (\"feminicide\") involves the violent deaths of hundreds of women and girls since 1993 in the northern Mexican region of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, a border city across the Rio Grande from the U.S. city of El Paso, Texas. As of February 27, 2005, the number of murdered women in Ciudad Juárez since 1993 is estimated to be more than 370.\n\nAfter surveying 155 killings out of 340 documented between 1993 and 2003, a government committee found that roughly half were prompted by motives like robbery and gang wars, while a little more than a third involved sexual assault.\n\nThe murders of women and girls in Ciudad Juárez since 1993 have received international attention, primarily due to perceived government inaction in preventing violence against women and girls and bringing perpetrators to justice.\n\nEvidence suggests that a specific group of women and girls are being targeted in Ciudad Juárez. The victims share common characteristics, and there are many similarities in the violent crimes committed against them. Most of the victims are young women who come from impoverished backgrounds and work in maquiladoras, as factory workers, in other sectors of the informal economy, or are students.\n\nIn addition, many victims share common physical attributes, including dark skin, slender physique, and dark, shoulder-length hair. In terms of the crimes, similarities across cases include the rape, torture and mutilation of the victims.\n\nThere are various media reports with different numbers ranging from hundreds to thousands of female homicides in the Ciudad Juárez region. For this reason, Amnesty International reports, \"Inadequate official data on the crimes committed in Chihuahua, particularly accurate figures on the exact number of murders and abductions of girls and women, has led to disputes around the issues that obscure the quest for justice.\"\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, as of February 2005, more than 370 young women and girls had been murdered in the cities of Ciudad Juárez and Chihuahua. More recently, prosecutors from the state of Chihuahua reported that in 2010, 270 women were killed within the state, of these murders 247 occurred in Juárez. In 2011, Chihuahua's Attorney General, Carlos Manuel Salas, announced during a briefing in August 2011 that 222 women had been killed in Chihuahua since January of that year. Of these 222 murders, 130 of them occurred in Ciudad Juárez. In total, more than 300 women were murdered in the city in 2011.\n\nA study was conducted in 2008 on the Feminicide Database 1993–2007 at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte which documented incidents of feminicide that occurred in Ciudad Juárez from 1993–2007. Of the various different kinds of murders that were analyzed, the study found two common patterns in the data which were classified as intimate feminicide and systemic sexual feminicide. Intimate feminicide refers to women who were killed by men that were close to them. According to the study, intimate feminicide accounted for 30.4% of the murders of women and girls in Juárez from 1993–2007. Systematic sexual feminicide refers to systematic patterns in the killing of women and children including kidnapping, sexual violence, torture, and body abandonment in areas such as desert areas, garbage dumps, and sewage ditches among others. According to the study, systemic sexual feminicide accounted for 31.8% of the murders of women in Juárez from 1993–2007.\n\nAccording to Molly Molloy, a research librarian and professor at New Mexico State University (also founder and maintainer of \"Frontera List\", a long-running mailing list dedicated to information and discussion about issues in the U.S.-Mexico border), the situation in Juárez is one of \"impunity regardless of gender\". She states that \"female murder victims have never comprised more than 18 percent of the overall number of murder victims in Ciudad Juárez, and in the last two decades that figure averages at less than 10 percent. That’s less than in the United States, where about 20 to 25 percent of the people who are murdered in a given year are women\".\n\nOther scholars also state that femicide rates in Ciudad Juárez are lower than in American cities such as Houston and Ensenada, and as a share of overall homicide rates they are typically lower than in other cities.\n\nThe uncertainty about the characteristics of the perpetrators, their relationships to the victims, or their motives is primarily due to the dysfunction of the Mexican justice system as most cases have been inadequately investigated and documented. While in many of the cases in Ciudad Juárez it has yet to be determined who exactly has committed the murders, much of the literature on this issue purports that patriarchal backlash against working women may be a potential motive for the killings.\n\nIt is believed that the femicide in Ciudad Juárez may be related to organized crime (like prostitution rings) given the presence of the powerful drug cartels in the region. Further, criminal gangs have become a permanent threat particularly to women on the border. Gang activity creates high risk for women especially due to very little institutional protection.\n\nThis patriarchal backlash may indeed be the result of lack of employment opportunities for men and more women entering the workforce which has altered traditional gender dynamics and created a situation of conflict between the sexes. Other researchers attribute the murders to Mexico's structural crisis including increasing poverty, unemployment, the disintegration of the peasant economy, migration, and a dysfunctional justice system. Overall, in considering the potential motives for gendered violence against women, academic Mercedes Olivera has argued that femicide is a mechanism of domination, control, oppression, and power over women.\n\nIn examining femicide in Ciudad Juárez, it is important to consider the impact of the drug trade. Juárez is the seat of the Mexican drug cartel which has resulted in high levels of violence that have been directed at the Mexican population. It is believed that the femicide in Ciudad Juárez may be related to the powerful drug cartels along the border. Further, gangs have become a permanent threat particularly to women on the border. Gang activity creates high risk for women especially due to very little institutional protection.\n\nOften, misogyny is a common trait of gang activity. According to a study conducted in 2008 using the Feminicide Database 1993–2007 at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte, which documented incidents of feminicide that occurred in Ciudad Juárez from 1993–2007, 9.1% of the murders of women were attributed to organized crime and drug trafficking activities.\n\nFrom 2007-2010, the murder rate spiked by around 1000%, from around 1 reported murder per day, to around 10 murders per day on average. After the ATF gunwalking scandal where United States federal ATF agents were exposed for engaging in a scheme to \"inadvertently\" arm Mexican drug cartels with firearms in 2010, the rate has gradually declined from the previous status of the \"murder capital of the world\".\n\nMaquiladoras are widely known for their cheap labor and their exploitative conditions, such as regularly violating basic human rights, that often target women. Women and girls often migrate from villages or rural areas in other parts of Mexico in search of work in the maquilas. According to Livingston, this migration of women created, \"a new phenomenon of mobile, independent and vulnerable working women,\" in cities like Ciudad Juárez. Women and girls are often funneled to work in areas that require lower education, and pay lower wages.\n\nMaquiladoras construct their female workforce under the notion that female workers are temporary workers, therefore justifying lower wages and creating a high turnover rate of laborers. According to Monarrez Fragoso, \"the practices of the maquiladora industry towards the workers reveal a consume and dispose cycle.\" This consume and dispose cycle represents how the maquila industry creates \"disposable\" women referencing the devaluation and expendable nature of their labor.\n\nMany of the murder victims in Ciudad Juárez have been maquiladora employees. Despite the expansion of the maquila industry, Juárez still remained a relatively poor and undeveloped city lacking infrastructure in some parts such as electricity and paved roads. As a part of their daily commute, many women maquila workers walk through such areas to and from company buses creating vulnerability to be victimized. In addition, the increased involvement of women in the labor force may also be a contributing factor to the victimization of women and girls because of the competition for economic resources in decades in which male unemployment has been high.\n\nThe implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994 resulted in the expansion of the maquiladora industry and created new opportunities for employment for women outside of the home and in the factories. The availability of cheap labor made it attractive for business owners to open factories in Mexico, and the availability of cheap employment attracted many, especially women, to border towns such as Ciudad Juárez. Research has shown correlations between economic and political issues and violence against women along the border.\n\nAcademic Katherine Pantaleo has argued that, \"NAFTA, as a capitalist approach, has directly created a devaluation of women and an increase in gendered violence.\" Further, according to Wright, in the time period between the implementation of NAFTA in 1994 and 2001, \"the homicide rate for men increased by 300 percent, while for women it increased by 600 percent.\" Such studies indicate the importance of exploring the effects of NAFTA when considering the possible causes of the murder of women and girls in Ciudad Juárez. Consequently, it has been suggested that amendments be made to NAFTA that include human rights provisions.\n\nSociocultural factors in relation to traditional gender roles have impacted violence against women in Mexico. According to Pantaleo, \"Under the view of patriarchy, two expressions are commonly used in Mexico to show the difference in status of males and females; these expressions are machismo and marianismo.\" Machismo is characterized by male power and aggression; while marianismo is characterized by subordination and domestic gender roles. As part of the marianismo ideology, women are expected to fulfill domestic roles as wives and mothers and to refrain from paid labor outside of the home.\n\nWomen who leave their homes to seek employment in the maquila industry directly challenge the marianismo ideal of womanhood. Olivera suggests that this changed situation challenges hypermasculinity, in which aggressive aspects of male identity are exaggerated in order to preserve their identity. According to Livingston, gender-directed violence in Ciudad Juárez may be a negative reaction as women \"gain greater personal autonomy and independence while men lose ground.\"\n\nThe murder of women in Juárez has attracted global attention since 1993 given suspected police and government inaction to prevent the murders and bring perpetrators to justice. There have been several international rulings against Mexico for its inadequate response to the increasing violence against women. Police and government officials have been accused of responding with indifference to the crimes against women as well as exhibiting tolerance for such crimes, conducting inadequate and negligent investigations, ineffectively responding to the crimes, and failing to prevent and protect women from violence.\n\nAs a result of international attention, police and government officials have been politically pressured to respond to the murders. Consequently, due to political pressure for justice, police have been accused of rushing to make arrests and solve cases while the crimes continue to occur. Further, out of hundreds of cases, only three convictions have ever been made and there is much skepticism involving the integrity of the convictions.\n\nThe methodology and integrity of police investigations has been questioned due to allegations of torture and human rights violations of alleged suspects. Amnesty International reports, \"The government [has] failed to take effective measures to investigate and bring to justice those responsible for the abduction and killing of three women in Ciudad Juárez... or to combat the ongoing pattern of violence against women and discrimination in the city.\n\nAccording to Pantaleo, \"While around 400 girls and women have been abducted and murdered, few arrests and convictions have resulted.\" For convictions that have been made, there is a great deal of controversy that surrounds them. Police have been accused of conducting rushed investigations with questionable methodology and integrity. Further, suspects that have been apprehended have claimed that they were tortured into confessing. This has caused uncertainty of the legitimacy of both investigations and convictions.\n\nIn 1996, an Egyptian national, Omar Sharif Latif or Abdul Latif Sharif was convicted of 3 murders and sentenced to a 30-year prison term. After his arrest in 1995, the murders continued and authorities claimed that Sharif directed members of the \"Los Rebeldes\" gang to continue the murders while he was incarcerated. These members were indicted and convicted as a result of this connection. The gang members accused of carrying out murders under Sharif's orders claimed they were tortured while in police custody. According to Monarrez Fragoso, \"In the year 2000, it was known that the body of Elizabeth Castro Garcia, whose murder was attributed to Omar Sharif Latif, does not belong to her.\" His conviction is currently under appeal.\n\nIn 2001, Victor Garcia Uribe and Gustavo Gonzalez Meza were apprehended for eight murders. Gustavo Gonzalez Mesa died suspiciously while in police custody. In 2004, Victor Garcia Uribe, a bus driver, was convicted of eight murders that took place in 2001. He confessed to these murders but claimed that he was tortured into confessing by police.\n\nIn 2008, 16-year-old Ruby Frayre Escobedo was murdered by Sergio Barraza Bocanegra who was acquitted at his first trial for lack of evidence. Following two years of activism, a retrial convicted Bocanegra who remained on the run. In 2010, Ruby's mother, Marisela Escobedo Ortiz, was assassinated by a shot to the head at point blank range while demonstrating for justice in front of the Governor's Palace in Chihuahua.\n\nThere have been several international rulings against Mexico for its inadequate response to the increasing violence against women. According to Livingston, \"In 1998 the National Commission for Human Rights issued a report charging gross irregularities and general negligence in state investigations, including the misidentification of corpses, failure to obtain expert tests on forensic evidence, failure to conduct autopsies or obtain semen analysis... failure to file written reports, [and] incompetence in keeping records of the rising tide of women murders.\"\n\nIn 2004, under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) conducted an inquiry into the allegations that hundreds of murders of women and girls had taken place in the area of Ciudad Juarez since 1993 at the urging of several NGOs. In order for the inquiry to take place it was required that there was reliable evidence that showed that Mexico was in violation of rights established by CEDAW. The Committee analyzed the gender-based crimes occurring in Ciudad Juárez and found the two common forms were murder and disappearances. The Committee also analyzed the response of the government and found that their initial response was indifference and that the government exhibited tolerance of these crimes for years.\n\nFurther, the Committee concluded that the measures undertaken by the Mexican State in response to gendered violence against women leading up to the time of their inquiry were, \"few and ineffective at all levels of the State\". The Committee made several recommendations for Mexico to adhere to. Although these recommendations were not legally binding, they were influential in the public sphere.\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, \"In [2009], the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled on the “cotton field” (Campo Algodonero) case that Mexico was guilty of discrimination and of failing to protect three young women murdered in 2001 in Ciudad Juárez or to ensure an effective investigation into their abduction and murder.\" The Court ordered Mexico to conduct a new investigation of the murders, create a national memorial for the victims, pay reparations to the families of the victims, and to improve measures which prevent and adequately investigate the murder of women and girls.\n\nAccording to Simmons, \"The murders in Juárez would not have drawn such national and international attention if it were not for the heroic efforts of the victims' families and other women.\" There have been numerous local and international organizations that have helped draw attention to the issue of the murder of women in Juárez which has helped to create pressure for the Mexican government to agree to further its efforts to respond to violence against women. Further, the work of political leaders, activists, artists, academics, and journalists combined have also been instrumental in bringing international attention to the murder of women in Juárez and the issues that surround them.\n\nIn 1999, a group of feminist activists founded Casa Amiga, Juárez's first rape crisis and sexual assault center. The center works to provide women in Juárez with a refuge against violence, therapy, legal council, and medical attention. Casa Amiga also works to raise public awareness both locally and internationally regarding the exploitation and dehumanization of women in Juárez.\n\nIn 2002, a social justice movement named Ni Una Mas, which in Spanish means \"not one more,\" was formed to raise international awareness to violence against women in Juárez. The movement consists of a variety of domestic and international organizations and individual activists. Ni Una Mas participants demand that the Mexican state implement strategies that prevent violence against women including murder and kidnappings and that the state conduct competent investigations on crimes already committed.\n\nIn addition to Casa Amiga and Ni Una Mas, family support groups such as Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C., which in Spanish means \"Our Daughters Back Home,\" have also formed in response to the violence against women in Juárez. Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C. has also worked to bring domestic and international media attention to the violence against women in Juárez.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Founded in 1851, Tbilisi Opera is the main opera house of Georgia and one of the oldest such establishments in eastern Europe.\n\nSince 1896, the theater has resided in an exotic neo-Moorish edifice originally constructed by Victor Johann Gottlieb Schröter, a prominent architect of Baltic German origin. Although definitively Oriental in its decorations and style, the building's layout, foyers and the main hall are that of a typical European opera house. Since its foundation, the theater has been damaged by several fires and underwent major rehabilitation works under Soviet and Georgian leadership; the most recent restoration effort concluded in January 2016, having taken six years and costing approximately 40 million U.S. dollars, donated by a Georgian business foundation.\n\nThe opera house is one of the centers of cultural life in Tbilisi and was once home to Zacharia Paliashvili, the Georgian national composer whose name the institution has carried since 1937. The Opera and Ballet Theater also houses the State Ballet of Georgia under the leadership of internationally renowned Georgian ballerina Nina Ananiashvili. In recent years it has hosted opera stars such as Montserrat Caballé and José Carreras, while also serving as a traditional venue for national celebrations and presidential inaugurations. \n\nThe foundation of the Tiflis Imperial Opera was closely intertwined with the turbulent political processes in Georgia following the country's annexation by the Russian Empire in 1801. In the first half of the 19th century, Georgia remained a restless and poorly integrated part of the empire. Unhappy with Russian policies, in 1832 Georgian aristocracy hatched a plot against the local Russian authorities, which was discovered and resulted in multiple arrests and repressions in the subsequent years. Anxious to reconcile the Georgian opinion in view of these lingering difficulties, the new Viceroy of the Caucasus, Count Mikhail Vorontsov, implemented a number of cultural initiatives, one of which was the foundation of the opera. The declared purpose of its establishment was to benefit the \"public well-being\" but it also served an important political goal of fully integrating the local Georgian aristocracy into the Imperial social life, thereby distracting them from any further anti-Russian conspiracies. \n\nTo satisfy Georgians, Vorontsov went on to patronize Georgian-language theater performances and did everything Saint Petersburg would permit to win over locals. These type of efforts were particularly relevant in light of the ongoing Shamil's rebellion in the North Caucasus, which prompted some Russians to see Georgian aristocrats as the only bulwark protecting Russia's southern imperial borders. Vorontsov's conciliatory efforts were not without controversy, as not all Russians were enthusiastic about non-Russian contributions to the city's cultural development; some objected to Georgian-language productions and had them moved to different days, rather than precede regular opera performances as it was done up to that point.\n\nAt Vorontsov's initiative, the original theater site was chosen on Rustaveli Avenue in Erivan Square, an area the administration correctly envisioned would be the center of the expanding city. The land was given free of charge from the governor of the Tiflis Governorate, provided the theater would belong to the city.\n\nThe foundations of The Tiflis Imperial Theater were laid down on 15 April 1847. Italian architect Giovanni Scudieri, who had come to Tiflis from Odessa, was hired to oversee the project. The construction was completed in 1851.The interior of the theater was decorated by a Parisian designer, using colored velvet, gold and silver details, and expensive silks. A massive chandelier weighing , unassembled in 12 large boxes, was shipped by a steamer from Marseille to Kulevi on the Black Sea coast. Buffalo pulled the chandelier more than to Tiflis. Russian painter Grigory Gagarin created the artwork for the theater. Vorontsov appointed writer Vladimir Sollogub as the theater's first director.\n\nOn 12 April 1851, the theater held its grand opening, attended by the high society of Tiflis. As the theater stage was not yet complete, the theater instead held a masked ball and charity fundraiser for the Saint Nino Women's College.\n\nSeveral months later the popular Parisian newspaper \"L'Illustration\" (issue 25 October 1851) printed a large article by Edmond de Bares with two pictures of the interior of the theater. The author wrote, \"This is the only theatre in the city, the interior of which is totally Moorish in style, and is doubtless one of the most elegant, beautiful and fascinating theatrical constructions, conceived by man.\"\n\nIn the spring of 1851, the theater director invited an Italian opera troupe, which had been touring the Russian Empire under the conductorship of Francisco Asenjo Barbieri, to perform in Tiflis. The Italians traveled by carriage from Novocherkassk, but became ill and exhausted as they made their way into the Caucasus Mountains. By the time they reached Stavropol in southern Russia, they had lost all patience and refused to continue to Tiflis. Finally they resumed, pausing often to rest as they traveled via the Georgian Military Highway, before arriving in Tiflis on 9 October 1851.\n\nOne month later, the first theatrical season officially opened in Tiflis with \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" by Gaetano Donizetti. After the spectacle, which had a great success, the hosts led Barbieri and the company to the left bank of the Kura River for a public feast, where people celebrated on boats for the whole night. \n\nThe Italians performed 12 different opera performances over the course of three months. As a consequence the orchestra was enriched with new instruments and musical scores. Foreign orchestra performers came to Tiflis and some settled there.\n\nOn 11 October 1874, a fire began before a performance of Vincenzo Bellini's \"Norma\". Though the fire brigade was across the street, the firefighters did not respond at first and did not bring ladders when they did, leading to outrage and accusations of the fire being intentional. The theater was completely destroyed, including the rich musical library, costumes, scenery, props and all of Gagarin's paintings.\n\nPlans were made to rebuild the opera house. The theater decided to continue its season from the \"Summer Theater\", and returned 27 December with its production of \"Norma\". \n\nThe city held a contest for a new architectural design. Viktor Schröter, an architect of German origin from Saint Petersburg, submitted the winning design. Construction of the new theater took years to get underway. There were repeated delays throughout the project, with the design not officially approved by Governor Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich until 1880. Even after the construction began, it would sometimes come to a complete halt.\n\nThe theater finally reopened in 1896.\n\nIn 1937, the theater was renamed in honour of Zacharia Paliashvili, one of Georgia's national composers. Unrest and destabilization in Georgia in the 1990s affected the Tbilisi opera theater, as it did many others in the country. The government could not provide sufficient resources for theater to function: this prevented the creation of new scenery or costumes, the recruitment of artists, and maintenance of the already vulnerable building. Following the Rose Revolution, however, the newly elected government improved the situation in opera as part of its cultural reforms.\n\n"}

{"id": "361883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=361883", "title": "HMS Captain (1869)", "text": "HMS Captain (1869)\n\nHMS \"Captain\" was an unsuccessful warship built for the Royal Navy due to public pressure. She was a masted turret ship, designed and built by a private contractor against the wishes of the Controller's department. The \"Captain\" was completed in April 1870 and capsized in September 1870 with the loss of nearly 500 lives because of design and construction errors that led to inadequate stability.\n\nThe history of the \"Captain\" can be traced back to the Crimean War and the experiences of British captain Cowper Phipps Coles in 1855. Coles and a group of British sailors constructed a raft with guns protected by a 'cupola' and used the raft, named the \"Lady Nancy\", to shell the Russian town of Taganrog in the Black Sea. The \"Lady Nancy\" \"proved a great success\", and Coles patented his rotating turret after the war. Following Coles' patenting, the British Admiralty ordered a prototype of Coles' design in 1859, which was installed in the floating battery vessel, HMS \"Trusty\", for trials in 1861.\n\nThe trials with the \"Trusty\" impressed the Admiralty, and it ordered a coastal defence vessel, HMS \"Prince Albert\", to be built with four of Coles' turrets and a wooden 121-gun first rate ship-of-the-line under construction, HMS \"Royal Sovereign\", to be converted to a turret ship. The \"Prince Albert\" was completed with four turrets mounting single 12-ton 9-inch guns and armour plate on the hull. The \"Royal Sovereign\" had five 10.5-inch, 12.5-ton guns in one twin and three single turrets.\n\nBoth ships were flush deck with only a jury rig, and could only operate as coastal service vessels. The Admiralty, although impressed with Coles' rotating turret, required oceangoing vessels to protect its worldwide empire. Unfortunately for Coles, engine technology had not yet caught up with his designs and consequently oceangoing ships required sails. Combining rigging, masts, and turrets proved complicated if rigging was not to impede the turrets' arcs of fire.\n\nIn early 1863 the Admiralty gave Coles permission to work with Nathaniel Barnaby, head of staff of the Department of Naval Construction, on the design of a rigged vessel with two turrets and three tripod masts. In June 1863 the Admiralty suspended progress on the vessel until the \"Royal Sovereign\" finished her trials.\n\nIn 1864, Coles was allowed to start a second project: a rigged vessel with only one turret and based on the design of HMS \"Pallas\". He was lent the services of Joseph Scullard, Chief Draughtsman of Portsmouth Dockyard.\n\nThe next year, 1865, a committee established by the Admiralty to study the new design concluded that while the turret should be adopted, Coles' one-turret warship design had inadequate fire arcs. The committee proposed a two-turret fully rigged vessel with either two 9-inch \"(12 ton)\" guns per turret, or one 12-inch \"(22 ton)\" gun per turret. The committee's proposal was accepted by the Admiralty, and construction was started on \"Monarch\". \"Monarch's\" two turrets were each equipped with two 12-inch \"(25-ton)\" guns.\n\nStunned by the committee's decision to cancel his single-turret ship and his proposal for a two-turret vessel, and objecting to the \"Monarch's\" design, Coles launched a strong campaign against the project, attacking Robert Spencer Robinson, Controller of the Navy, and various other members of the committee and the Admiralty. So vociferously did Coles complain that in January 1866 his contract as a consultant to the Admiralty was terminated. At the end of January, his protestations that he had been misunderstood led to his being re-employed from 1 March 1866. Further, Coles lobbied the press and Parliament and was eventually able to force the Admiralty to allow him to build his own two-turret design.\n\nOn 8 May 1866, Coles informed the Admiralty of his selection of Laird Brothers' Merseyside yard, for the builder of the warship. The Merseyside yard had already built several successful iron warships. In mid-July, Lairds submitted two possible designs for Coles' proposed turret-ship. To prevent the rigging from being damaged when the guns fired through it, it was attached to a platform mounted above the gun turrets known as the hurricane deck instead of brought down to the main deck. Tripod masts were also used to minimise standing rigging.\n\nThe design called for the ship to have a low freeboard, and Coles' figures estimated it at . Both the Controller Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Spencer Robinson and the Chief Constructor Edward James Reed raised serious concerns. Robinson noted that the low freeboard could cause flooding issues on the gun deck, and Reed criticised the design in 1866 both for being too heavy and for having too high a centre of gravity. On the latter, Reed noted that it would cause issues \"especially as it is proposed to spread a large surface of canvas upon the \"Captain\"\". As the design neared completion, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir John Pakington, wrote on 23 July 1866 to Coles approving the building of the ship, but noting that responsibility for failure would lie on Coles' and the builders' lap.\n\nIn November 1866, the contract for HMS \"Captain\" was approved, and the design was finished. She was laid down 30 January 1867 at Laird's yard at Birkenhead, England, launched 27 March 1869 and completed in March 1870.\n\nInsufficient supervision during the building, owing partly to Coles' protracted illness, meant that she was heavier than planned. The designed freeboard was just , and the additional weight forced her to float deeper than expected, bring the freeboard down to just . This compares with for the two-turret \"Monarch\". The centre of gravity of the vessel also rose by about ten inches during construction. Reed raised havoc over the problems with the freeboard and the centre of gravity, but his objections were over-ruled during the \"Captain's\" trials.\n\nShe was commissioned on 30 April 1870 under Captain Hugh Talbot Burgoyne, VC. During trials in the following months, the \"Captain\" seemed to be everything that Coles promised and won over many followers. In trials versus the \"Monarch\", she performed well and returned to sea in July and August, travelling to Vigo, Spain and Gibraltar in separate runs.\n\nA trial was undertaken in 1870 to compare the accuracy and rate of fire of turret-mounted heavy guns with those in a centre-battery ship. The target was a long, high rock off Vigo. The speed of the ships was (\"some accounts say stationary\"). Each ship fired for five minutes, with the guns starting \"loaded and very carefully trained\". The guns fired Palliser shells with battering charges at a range of about . Three out of the \"Captain's\" four hits were achieved with the first salvo; firing this salvo caused the ship to roll heavily (±20°); smoke from firing made aiming difficult. Note that the \"Captain\" could be expected to capsize if inclined 21°. The \"Monarch\" and the \"Hercules\" also did better with their first salvo, were inconvenienced by the smoke of firing, and to a lesser extent were caused to roll by firing. On the \"Hercules\" the gunsights were on the guns, and this worked better than the turret roof gunsights used by the other ships.\n\nOn the afternoon of 6 September 1870 \"Captain\" was cruising with the combined Mediterranean and Channel Squadrons comprising 11 ships off Cape Finisterre. The ship made 9.5 knots under sail in a force six wind, which was increasing through the day. The commander in chief, Admiral Sir Alexander Milne, was on board to see her performance, and speed had risen to 11–13 knots before he departed. Not being accustomed to ships with such low freeboard, he was disturbed to note that at this speed with the strengthening sea, waves washed over the weather deck. The weather worsened with rain as the night progressed, and the number of sails was reduced. The wind was blowing from the port bow so that sails had to be angled to the wind, speed was much reduced, and there was considerable force pushing the ship sideways. As the wind rose to a gale, sail was reduced to only the fore staysail and fore and main topsails.\n\nShortly after midnight when a new watch came on duty, the ship was heeling over eighteen degrees and was felt to lurch to starboard twice. Orders were given to drop the fore topsail and release sheets (ropes) holding both topsails angled into the wind. Before the captain's order could be carried out, the roll increased, and she capsized and sank with the loss of around 480 lives, including Coles. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Hugh Childers, and Under-Secretary of State for War, Thomas Baring, both lost sons in the disaster. Only 27 of the crew survived, many by making it to a boat which had broken free.\n\nThe subsequent investigation on the loss of \"Captain\", in the form of a court-martial, under Sir James Hope, took place on board HMS \"Duke of Wellington\", in Portsmouth Harbour. It was somewhat of a departure for the Admiralty to seek scientific advice, but eminent engineers William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) and William John Macquorn Rankine were appointed to the enquiry. It concluded that the ship was insufficiently stable: at 14 degrees heel (when the edge of the deck touched the sea) the righting moment due to the buoyancy pushing the ship upright again was just 410-foot-tons (1.2 MN·m). HMS \"Monarch\", the masted turret ship proposed by the 1865 committee and designed by Reed, and which was in the area at the time of the sinking, had a righting moment of 6,500-foot-tons (20 MN·m) at the same angle. Maximum righting moment occurred at a heel of 21 degrees, and thereafter declined to zero at 54.5 degrees. \"Monarch's\" righting moment increased to a maximum at 40 degrees. Survivors testified that the \"Captain\" floated upside down for between three and ten minutes, which proved that the ship had capsized. An inclining test had been carried out at Portsmouth on 29 July 1870 to allow the ship's stability characteristics to be calculated. \"Captain\" set sail on the ship's final voyage before the results of the trial were published.\n\nThe inquiry concluded that \"the \"Captain\" was built in deference to public opinion expressed in Parliament and through other channels, and in opposition to views and opinions of the Controller and his Department\".\n\nThere are memorials to the crew in St Paul's Cathedral, Westminster Abbey, London, and St. Anne's church in Portsmouth.\n\nThe conclusion of the 1870 Court Martial is engraved upon the Memorial to the loss of H.M.S. \"Captain\", in the north aisle of St. Paul’s Cathedral. One doubts that Captain Coles or any of those involved, from the First Lord of the Admiralty and First Sea Lord down, could have taken exception to the Inquiry’s conclusion, apportioning the blame all round as it does:\n\n"}

The main goal of the festival is to educate people about Jewish culture, history and faith (Judaism), which flourished in Poland before the Holocaust, as well as to familiarize them with modern Jewish culture developing mostly in the United States and Israel, and finally, to provide entertainment.\n\nEach festival is held in late June or early July and takes nine days, from Saturday to Sunday. During that time concerts, exhibitions, plays, lectures, workshops, tours, etc. are organized. The two most important concerts are: the inaugural concert on the first Sunday, and the final concert on the last Saturday of the festival. The former usually takes place in one of seven synagogues of Kazimierz and features cantoral music; the latter is always held outdoors, in Ulica Szeroka, the main street of the Jewish part of Kazimierz, and features klezmer music. In between there are many more concerts, usually with some variations of klezmer music.\n\nThe workshops provide an occasion to learn about traditional Jewish cuisine, dance, music, calligraphy and other aspects of Jewish culture. More about Jewish culture, as well as about topics related to the Holocaust, is taught at numerous lectures. Exhibitions of Jewish art, particularly paper-cut, are also organized. The program of the festival also includes tours of the synagogues and cemeteries of Kazimierz as well as the former Nazi-era Kraków Ghetto in the nearby district of Podgórze. During the festival Gentiles are also invited to watch or participate in Jewish prayers at the synagogue.\n\nJewish Culture Festival brings together artists of Jewish culture from all over the world - music bands, soloists, choirs, jazz musicians and dance teachers. The festival promotes a whole variety of different styles of Jewish music: synagogue song, hasidic, classical, Jewish folk and – very popular in Krakow nowadays – klezmer. For the Poles this event is a way of promotion of Jewish culture and paying a homage to the community that used to live in Poland, although many Jews were reportedly offended by the commercialization of Polish Jewish culture. \"Others argue that there is something deeper taking place in Poland as the country heals from the double wounds of Nazi and Communist domination.\"\n\nIt is one of Poland's major annual cultural events and one of the biggest festivals of Jewish culture in the world. Artists and entertainers usually associated with the festival include: Benzion Miller, Yaakov Stark, David Krakauer, Frank London, Leopold Kozłowski, Michael Alpert, Theodore Bikel, Paul Brody and many others.

The games \"(ludi)\" included both theatrical performances \"(ludi scaenici)\" and athletic competitions for the purpose of entertaining the common people of Rome.\n\nThe Plebeian Games may have been celebrated among the common people without an official place on the religious calendar until plebeians rose to positions of highest prominence; Cicero, at least, thought they were Rome's oldest \"ludi\". They are known to have been held each year from 220 onward, but may have been much older. It may be most accurate to say the \"Ludi Plebeii\" were first established as a \"public\" festival in 220 BC. Because the proceedings of the Plebeian Games strikingly resemble those of the \"Ludi Romani\" (\"Roman Games\"), T.P. Wiseman has suggested that they were created by the \"plebs\" as an assertion of their own identity, perhaps as early as the 5th or 4th century BC.\n\nThe \"Ludi Plebeii\" were presented by the plebeian aediles and celebrated plebeian political liberty, but tradition varied as to freedom from what: either the tyranny of the Tarquins in the Regal period, or the dominance of the patricians, the hereditary ruling class of early Republican Rome (see \"Conflict of the Orders\"). \n\nAccording to one ancient source, the games were held in the Circus Flaminius, which was associated with the common people of Rome \"(plebs)\". Nearly all other games were held in the Circus Maximus. The Circus Flaminius was built by the plebeian censor Gaius Flaminius in 220 BC, and the annual games may have been instituted by him that year. During the festival, a feast of Jupiter \"(Epulum Iovis)\" was held November 13, a cavalry parade November 14, and circus games \"(ludi circenses\", mainly chariot races) November 15–17. The siting of the games at the Circus Flaminius may thus be an error, since the Circus Flaminius had no track for chariot racing. A procession similar to that of the \"Ludi Romani\" is likely also to have been part of the festivities.\n\nPlautus first presented his comedy \"Stichus\" at the Plebeian Games of 200 BC.\n\nLivy notes that the \"ludi\" had to be repeated three times in 216 BC, owing to a \"vitium\" (ritual fault) that disrupted the correct performance of events.\n\n"}

In 2009, however, the trophies were awarded prior to the event final.\n\nSweden's Melodifestivalen also presents the awards during their own competition proper.\n\nSince 2010, the show commentators have replaced the previous winners as the selection jury for the winners.\nThis award was first presented in 2004, replacing the Fan Award.\n\nThe Fan Award was handed out in 2002 & 2003, and voted on by the members of OGAE, the Eurovision international fan club. It was discontinued and replaced by the Composer Award in 2004.\n\nIn 2008, a special award, called the Poplight Fan Award, was introduced and was voted on by ESC fans (see above). It has not been awarded since then.\nSince 2005 Sveriges Television (SVT) has awarded Marcel Bezençon Awards during its national selection Melodifestivalen. These awards follow the same format as that for the Eurovision awards, with awards given to songs that competed in the final of the contest. Songs that won the Eurovision Song Contest are indicated in bold.\n\nAs with for the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest a fan award was also given out for the 2008 Melodifestivalen.\n\n"}
{"id": "19022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19022", "title": "Measurement", "text": "Measurement\n\nMeasurement is the assignment of a number to a characteristic of an object or event, which can be compared with other objects or events. The scope and application of measurement are dependent on the context and discipline. In the natural sciences and engineering, measurements do not apply to nominal properties of objects or events, which is consistent with the guidelines of the \"International vocabulary of metrology\" published by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures. However, in other fields such as statistics as well as the social and behavioral sciences, measurements can have multiple levels, which would include nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio scales.\n\nMeasurement is a cornerstone of trade, science, technology, and quantitative research in many disciplines. Historically, many measurement systems existed for the varied fields of human existence to facilitate comparisons in these fields. Often these were achieved by local agreements between trading partners or collaborators. Since the 18th century, developments progressed towards unifying, widely accepted standards that resulted in the modern International System of Units (SI). This system reduces all physical measurements to a mathematical combination of seven base units. The science of measurement is pursued in the field of metrology.\n\nThe measurement of a property may be categorized by the following criteria: type, magnitude, unit, and uncertainty. They enable unambiguous comparisons between measurements.\n\nMeasurements most commonly use the International System of Units (SI) as a comparison framework. The system defines seven fundamental units: kilogram, metre, candela, second, ampere, kelvin, and mole. Six of these units are defined without reference to a particular physical object which serves as a standard (artifact-free), while the kilogram is still embodied in an artifact which rests at the headquarters of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Sèvres near Paris. Artifact-free definitions fix measurements at an exact value related to a physical constant or other invariable phenomena in nature, in contrast to standard artifacts which are subject to deterioration or destruction. Instead, the measurement unit can only ever change through increased accuracy in determining the value of the constant it is tied to.\n\nThe first proposal to tie an SI base unit to an experimental standard independent of fiat was by Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), who proposed to define the metre in terms of the wavelength of a spectral line. This directly influenced the Michelson–Morley experiment; Michelson and Morley cite Peirce, and improve on his method.\n\nWith the exception of a few fundamental quantum constants, units of measurement are derived from historical agreements. Nothing inherent in nature dictates that an inch has to be a certain length, nor that a mile is a better measure of distance than a kilometre. Over the course of human history, however, first for convenience and then for necessity, standards of measurement evolved so that communities would have certain common benchmarks. Laws regulating measurement were originally developed to prevent fraud in commerce.\n\nUnits of measurement are generally defined on a scientific basis, overseen by governmental or independent agencies, and established in international treaties, pre-eminent of which is the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM), established in 1875 by the Metre Convention, overseeing the International System of Units (SI) and having custody of the International Prototype Kilogram. The metre, for example, was redefined in 1983 by the CGPM in terms of light speed, while in 1960 the international yard was defined by the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and South Africa as being \"exactly\" 0.9144 metres.\n\nIn the United States, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), a division of the United States Department of Commerce, regulates commercial measurements. In the United Kingdom, the role is performed by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), in Australia by the National Measurement Institute, in South Africa by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and in India the National Physical Laboratory of India.\n\nBefore SI units were widely adopted around the world, the British systems of English units and later imperial units were used in Britain, the Commonwealth and the United States. The system came to be known as U.S. customary units in the United States and is still in use there and in a few Caribbean countries. These various systems of measurement have at times been called \"foot-pound-second\" systems after the Imperial units for length, weight and time even though the tons, hundredweights, gallons, and nautical miles, for example, are different for the U.S. units. Many Imperial units remain in use in Britain, which has officially switched to the SI system—with a few exceptions such as road signs, which are still in miles. Draught beer and cider must be sold by the imperial pint, and milk in returnable bottles can be sold by the imperial pint. Many people measure their height in feet and inches and their weight in stone and pounds, to give just a few examples. Imperial units are used in many other places, for example, in many Commonwealth countries that are considered metricated, land area is measured in acres and floor space in square feet, particularly for commercial transactions (rather than government statistics). Similarly, gasoline is sold by the gallon in many countries that are considered metricated.\n\nThe metric system is a decimal system of measurement based on its units for length, the metre and for mass, the kilogram. It exists in several variations, with different choices of base units, though these do not affect its day-to-day use. Since the 1960s, the International System of Units (SI) is the internationally recognised metric system. Metric units of mass, length, and electricity are widely used around the world for both everyday and scientific purposes.\n\nThe metric system features a single base unit for many physical quantities. Other quantities are derived from the standard SI units. Multiples and fractions are expressed as powers of 10 of each unit. When smaller or larger units are more convenient for given use, metric prefixes can be added to the base unit to denote its multiple by a power of ten: a thousandth (10) of a metre is a \"milli\"metre, while a thousand (10) metres is a \"kilo\"metre. Unit conversions are thus always simple, so that convenient magnitudes for measurements are achieved by simply moving the decimal place: 1.234 metres is 1234 millimetres or 0.001234 kilometres. The use of fractions, such as 2/5 of a metre, is not prohibited, but uncommon. There is no profusion of different units with different conversion factors as in the Imperial system which uses, for example, inches, feet, yards, fathoms, and rods for length.\n\nThe International System of Units (abbreviated as SI from the French language name \"Système International d'Unités\") is the modern revision of the metric system. It is the world's most widely used system of units, both in everyday commerce and in science. The SI was developed in 1960 from the metre-kilogram-second (MKS) system, rather than the centimetre-gram-second (CGS) system, which, in turn, had many variants. During its development the SI also introduced several newly named units that were previously not a part of the metric system. The original SI units for the seven basic physical quantities were:\nThe mole was subsequently added to this list and the degree Kelvin renamed the kelvin.\n\nThere are two types of SI units, base units and derived units. Base units are the simple measurements for time, length, mass, temperature, amount of substance, electric current and light intensity. Derived units are constructed from the base units, for example, the watt, i.e. the unit for power, is defined from the base units as m·kg·s. Other physical properties may be measured in compound units, such as material density, measured in kg/m.\n\nThe SI allows easy multiplication when switching among units having the same base but different prefixes. To convert from metres to centimetres it is only necessary to multiply the number of metres by 100, since there are 100 centimetres in a metre. Inversely, to switch from centimetres to metres one multiplies the number of centimetres by 0.01 or divide centimetres by 100.\n\nA ruler or rule is a tool used in, for example, geometry, technical drawing, engineering, and carpentry, to measure lengths or distances or to draw straight lines. Strictly speaking, the \"ruler\" is the instrument used to rule straight lines and the calibrated instrument used for determining length is called a \"measure\", however common usage calls both instruments \"rulers\" and the special name \"straightedge\" is used for an unmarked rule. The use of the word \"measure\", in the sense of a measuring instrument, only survives in the phrase \"tape measure\", an instrument that can be used to measure but cannot be used to draw straight lines. As can be seen in the photographs on this page, a two-metre carpenter's rule can be folded down to a length of only 20 centimetres, to easily fit in a pocket, and a five-metre-long tape measure easily retracts to fit within a small housing.\n\nSome non-systematic names are applied for some multiples of some units.\n\nThe Australian building trades adopted the metric system in 1966 and the units used for measurement of length are metres (m) and millimetres (mm). Centimetres (cm) are avoided as they cause confusion when reading plans. For example, the length two and a half metres is usually recorded as 2500 mm or 2.5 m; it would be considered non-standard to record this length as 250 cm.\n\nAmerican surveyors use a decimal-based system of measurement devised by Edmund Gunter in 1620. The base unit is Gunter's chain of which is subdivided into 4 rods, each of 16.5 ft or 100 links of 0.66 feet. A link is abbreviated \"lk,\" and links \"lks\" in old deeds and land surveys done for the government.\n\nTime is an abstract measurement of elemental changes over a non spatial continuum. It is denoted by numbers and/or named periods such as hours, days, weeks, months and years. It is an apparently irreversible series of occurrences within this non spatial continuum. It is also used to denote an interval between two relative points on this continuum.\n\n\"Mass\" refers to the intrinsic property of all material objects to resist changes in their momentum. \"Weight\", on the other hand, refers to the downward force produced when a mass is in a gravitational field. In free fall, (no net gravitational forces) objects lack weight but retain their mass. The Imperial units of mass include the ounce, pound, and ton. The metric units gram and kilogram are units of mass.\n\nOne device for measuring weight or mass is called a weighing scale or, often, simply a \"scale\". A spring scale measures force but not mass, a balance compares weight, both require a gravitational field to operate. Some of the most accurate instruments for measuring weight or mass are based on load cells with a digital read-out, but require a gravitational field to function and would not work in free fall.\n\nThe measures used in economics are physical measures, nominal price value measures and real price measures. These measures differ from one another by the variables they measure and by the variables excluded from measurements.\n\nIn the field of survey research, measures are taken from individual attitudes, values, and behavior using questionnaires as a measurement instrument. As all other measurements, measurement in survey research is also vulnerable to measurement error, i.e. the departure from the true value of the measurement and the value provided using the measurement instrument. In substantive survey research, measurement error can lead to biased conclusions and wrongly estimated effects. In order to get accurate results, when measurement errors appear, the results need to be corrected for measurement errors.\n\nSince accurate measurement is essential in many fields, and since all measurements are necessarily approximations, a great deal of effort must be taken to make measurements as accurate as possible. For example, consider the problem of measuring the time it takes an object to fall a distance of one metre (about 39 in). Using physics, it can be shown that, in the gravitational field of the Earth, it should take any object about 0.45 second to fall one metre. However, the following are just some of the sources of error that arise:\n\nAdditionally, other sources of experimental error include:\n\nScientific experiments must be carried out with great care to eliminate as much error as possible, and to keep error estimates realistic.\n\nIn the classical definition, which is standard throughout the physical sciences, \"measurement\" is the determination or estimation of ratios of quantities. Quantity and measurement are mutually defined: quantitative attributes are those possible to measure, at least in principle. The classical concept of quantity can be traced back to John Wallis and Isaac Newton, and was foreshadowed in Euclid's Elements.\n\nIn the representational theory, \"measurement\" is defined as \"the correlation of numbers with entities that are not numbers\". The most technically elaborated form of representational theory is also known as additive conjoint measurement. In this form of representational theory, numbers are assigned based on correspondences or similarities between the structure of number systems and the structure of qualitative systems. A property is quantitative if such structural similarities can be established. In weaker forms of representational theory, such as that implicit within the work of Stanley Smith Stevens, numbers need only be assigned according to a rule.\n\nThe concept of measurement is often misunderstood as merely the assignment of a value, but it is possible to assign a value in a way that is not a measurement in terms of the requirements of additive conjoint measurement. One may assign a value to a person's height, but unless it can be established that there is a correlation between measurements of height and empirical relations, it is not a measurement according to additive conjoint measurement theory. Likewise, computing and assigning arbitrary values, like the \"book value\" of an asset in accounting, is not a measurement because it does not satisfy the necessary criteria.\n\nThree type of Representational theory\n\n1) Empirical relation\n\nIn science, an empirical relationship is a relationship or correlation based solely on observation rather than theory. An empirical relationship requires only confirmatory data irrespective of theoretical basis\n\n2) The rule of mapping\n\nThe real world is the Domain of mapping, and the mathematical world is the range. when we map the attribute to mathematical system, we have many choice for mapping and the range\n\n3) The representation condition of measurement\n\nInformation theory recognises that all data are inexact and statistical in nature. Thus the definition of measurement is: \"A set of observations that reduce uncertainty where the result is expressed as a quantity.\" This definition is implied in what scientists actually do when they measure something and report both the mean and statistics of the measurements. In practical terms, one begins with an initial guess as to the expected value of a quantity, and then, using various methods and instruments, reduces the uncertainty in the value. Note that in this view, unlike the positivist representational theory, all measurements are uncertain, so instead of assigning one value, a range of values is assigned to a measurement. This also implies that there is not a clear or neat distinction between estimation and measurement.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a measurement is an action that determines a particular property (position, momentum, energy, etc.) of a quantum system. Before a measurement is made, a quantum system is simultaneously described by all values in a spectrum, or range, of possible values, where the probability of measuring each value is determined by the wavefunction of the system. When a measurement is performed, the wavefunction of the quantum system \"collapses\" to a single, definite value. The unambiguous meaning of the measurement problem is an unresolved fundamental problem in quantum mechanics.\n\n"}
{"id": "9660551", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9660551", "title": "Mot Dag", "text": "Mot Dag\n\nMot Dag (, \"Towards Today\") was a Norwegian political group. The group was active from the 1920s to the early 1930s and was first affiliated with the Labor Party. After World War II, many of its former members were leaders in Norwegian politics and cultural activities.\nIt was established in 1921 under the initiative of Erling Falk (1887-1940), partly with origins in the debate forum in the Social Democratic Student Association (\"Den Socialdemokratiske Studenterforening\") at the University of Oslo; partly from a Falk-led study circle which from 1919 involved Viggo Hansteen, Axel Sømme, and Arnold Hazeland. Members were strongly linked to Falk's personality and were subject to strict discipline. The magazine \"Mot Dag\" was published by the group between 1921 and 1936. The first editor was future author and publishing consultant Sigurd Hoel (1890-1960).\n\nMot Dag was a collective member of the Norwegian Labour Party from March 1922 until August 1924, but was excluded after a series of disagreements. In 1927, Mot Dag was a part of the Norwegian Communist Party (NKP). From 1929, Mot Dag was an independent political organization. In the middle of the 1930s, Mot Dag made an unsuccessful attempt to establish a new labor party. After the charismatic leader Erling Falk fell sick, Trond Hegna (1898–1992), took over the actual leadership. Hegna would later serve a member of the Norwegian Parliament (\"Storting\") and leader of the Storting's finance committee.\n\nIn 1930, the publishing house Fram forlag was established in part to publish the workers' encyclopedia (\"Arbeidernes Leksikon\". 1933). Both the magazine and organization dissolved in 1936. The organization had at most approximately 200 members and when it was dissolved in 1936 had about 100. Most of the members followed the internal orders to register in the Labor Party. \n\nAfter World War II, many former members Mot Dag were leaders in Norwegian politics and culture. Norway's first three post-war Prime Ministers Einar Gerhardsen, Oscar Torp, and John Lyng were all at one point in time part of Mot Dag. In addition were Gro Harlem Brundtland's father, Secretary of Defense Gudmund Harlem; the Labor Party's longstanding secretary Haakon Lie, Oslo's longstanding mayor Brynjulf Bull, and future West German chancellor Willy Brandt.\nMany well-known authors, intellectuals, and future leading politicians and officials were also members. Of note were filmmaker Olav Dalgard; the authors Helge Krog, Odd Eidem, Sigurd Hoel, Arnulf Øverland, Nic Waal and Inger Hagerup -- the latter two of the few women who were connected to Mot Dag; future director of Norway's military intelligence Vilhelm Evang and future director of the Norwegian Directorate for Health, Karl Evang. Economist and future university professor Johan Vogt, who together with Falk, was behind the first translation of \"Das Kapital\" into Norwegian.\n\n"}

He died from his injuries five days later in a London hospital.\n\nBrian Bishop joined the former Essex Constabulary in 1962 as a fifteen-year-old cadet. Bishop was 6 ft 7 in tall when he became PC 389 on 11 August 1966 and was posted to Colchester. He joined the dog section as a handler in 1968 and moved to the Force Support Unit in 1975. Later, he became a firearms instructor. He had been assigned to the rank of Acting Police Sergeant before he died.\n\nThe epitaph next to Bishop's memorial stone summarises the circumstances surrounding his death as follows:\n\nFive days after the shooting in Central Avenue near Frinton's seafront took place, Bishop died at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in Smithfield, London, on 27 August 1984. His colleague Police Sergeant Mervyn Fairweather, who was shot in the groin in the same incident, later recovered.\n\nColin Richards, a 35-year-old man from Brentwood, was arrested at the scene after another of Bishop's colleagues returned fire. Richards's injuries resulted in paralysis from the waist downwards. He was found guilty of Bishop's murder and of wounding Fairweather (having been charged with the latter's attempted murder) at Norwich Crown Court on 19 July 1985, and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 20 years.\n\nOn 19 February 1986 the then Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, unveiled a brown granite memorial stone adjacent to the seafront site where Bishop was shot. Bishop's memorial was only the third to be funded and erected by the Police Memorial Trust, and was the first to be sited outside London.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51755341", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51755341", "title": "NaturVision", "text": "NaturVision\n\nNaturVision is Germany’s oldest nature, wildlife and environmental film festival. Launched in 2002 in Neuschönau in the Bavarian Forest, the festival moved to its new home of Ludwigsburg in the German state of Baden-Württemberg in 2012. The venue is the Central Theater Ludwigsburg. Since 2014 the festival has also offered a free open-air cinema, a market with regional and sustainable vendors and a science slam.\n\nAt the heart of the festival is the international film competition. As well as nature and wildlife films, the NaturVision festival focuses heavily on environmental and sustainability issues. As well as the \"German Conservation and Sustainability Film Award\", the \"German Wildlife Film Award\" and the \"German Biodiversity Film Award\" are presented at the NaturVision award ceremony, where additional prize categories include camera work, dramatisation, film music, children’s film and the audience award.\n\nEach year the festival is devoted to a special theme, which is presented in films, talks and special events. In recent years, themes have included \"Soil & Water\" and renewable energy. In 2015 it was planned to seek and present in particular solutions for global problems in a multi-year cycle under the slogan \"Islands of the Future\".\n\nAnother area in which the NaturVision Film Festival is active is educating young people about the environment. So for instance, in the run-up to the festival, many schools in Baden-Württemberg run programmes to which experts or filmmakers are invited. At the \"Film & Discussion\" youth media workshops, experts show films about sustainability issues to the school classes, while teachers’ workshops explain the basics of media work with children and young people. As well as the school programme and childcare facilities, the festival also puts on a children’s film programme for all age groups. In the film competition a separate youth jury chooses its favourites and announces them at the grand gala award ceremony. To ensure that it can also campaign on the cultural policy level for environmental education to be provided through the festival, NaturVision also became one of the founding members of the Association of Bavarian Film Festivals in 2014.\n\nApart from the festival serving as a platform for NGOs focused on environmental topics, it also especially acts as meet up point for people in the film industry, offering workshops and opportunities for filmmakers, media representatives and other cultural creators to get together. Producers and filmmakers have the chance to engage with each other and the public. One of NaturVision’s objectives is to support and promote the genre of nature and environmental film. One strategy for this is Best-Of events assembled from last year's program, which take place primarily in Switzerland.\n\nTogether with Euronatur, natur magazine and Gelsenwasser, NaturVision sponsors the photography competition \"Europe’s Natural Treasures\", the results of which are compiled each year in the \"Fascination of Nature\" exhibition, which can be seen in various locations.\n\nNaturVision was founded in 2002 by Ralph Thoms and was held annually in the Bavarian Forest National Park in Neuschönau, Germany. Because of the venue’s proximity to the Czech border, the festival has enjoyed a collaboration with the Czech town of Vimperk since its early days.\n\nAlready in 2008 – as part of the German-Chinese Year of Science and Education – a collaboration with China was established, and German and Chinese filmmakers interacted for the first time in the workshops of the NaturVision Film Festival.\n\nIn 2012 the festival changed locations for financial reasons and was relaunched in Ludwigsburg in the German state of Baden-Württemberg. In the metropolitan area around Stuttgart, it has grown steadily since then and recorded over 13,000 visitors in 2016. The festival venue is the Central Theater Ludwigsburg, but the extensive supporting programme is spread over the whole city – from the open-air cinema in Arsenalplatz to the NaturVision Science Slam, which took place in the Film Gallery of the Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg in 2015.\n\nThe Bavarian Forest, meanwhile, is home to the NaturVision Film Days, which have been held in the Hans-Eisenmann-Haus in Neuschönau since 2012. Here, as well as the highlights of the Ludwigsburg festival, visitors can enjoy films that are of special interest for the region in the \"HeimatSachen\" series. What makes the Film Days so special is the location’s proximity to nature, with films \"about\" nature being presented \"in\" nature – or rather, in an open-air cinema set up in the forest. NaturVision’s youth environmental education efforts continue in the Bavarian Forest, with the ideas competition \"Educational film: Naturally!\" organised jointly with Bayernwerk AG, and a school programme before and during the contest inviting pupils to find out more about the environment and sustainability.\n\nPatron of the NaturVision Film Festival for the last two years has been Baden-Württemberg’s premier Winfried Kretschmann (of political party Alliance ’90/The Greens). For him the main focus of NaturVision is educating people about the environment:“The nature film festival NaturVision in Ludwigsburg marks an important intersection between media and environmental education. This is where passion for film and nature meet.” – Winfried KretschmannAnother champion of the festival is German actor Andreas Hoppe, best known for his role as a police inspector in the popular TV crime series \"Tatort\". He campaigns for animal welfare and the use of regional foods. Another celebrity guest and supporter of the festival is actor Hannes Jaenicke, whose production \"Hannes Jaenicke in Action for ….\" was awarded the first \"NaturVision Film Festival Special Prize\" in 2014.\n\nThree Germany based media outlets have been the official presenters of the festival since 2015: the German subsidiary of Discovery Channel, the German-French culture channel arte and Ludwigsburg's local newspaper Ludwigsburger Kreiszeitung.\n\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n\n2016\n"}
{"id": "47664408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47664408", "title": "Nazi gold train", "text": "Nazi gold train\n\nThe so-called Nazi gold train and Wałbrzych gold train concerns a local legend of a Nazi Germany-era train buried in a tunnel underground in Lower Silesia in January 1945 toward the end of World War II. The area is now part of southwest Poland, but was then in southeast Germany. Many searches for the train have been conducted since World War II, with no evidence of a train found. \n\nA search in 2015–2016 received global media interest, culminating in a dig involving the Polish military, local and state officials, but turned up only dirt. According to historians, it has never been proven the train ever existed.\n\nThe train is believed to be near the Polish city of Wałbrzych, which until 1945 was the German city of Waldenburg.\n\nAccording to local legend, the train left Breslau (now Wrocław) laden with gold and other treasures. It was driven into a system of tunnels under the Owl Mountains that were part of an unfinished Nazi secret Project Riese (German for \"giant\") near Wałbrzych. There it was buried in a warren of tunnels and mines created by the Nazis. The train is rumoured to hold up to 300 tonnes of gold, jewels, weapons, and masterpieces.\n\nIn the Polish People's Republic (1947-1989), the Polish Armed Forces carried out fruitless searches for the train. According to historians, it has never been proven that the train ever existed.\n\nIn late August 2015, news stories began circulating about two unidentified men who had obtained a death-bed confession about a buried gold train. The two were later identified as Piotr Koper of Poland and Andreas Richter of Germany, co-owners of the mine exploration company XYZ S.C. Using lawyers as an intermediary, the two men opened secret negotiations with the Polish government for a \"finders' fee\" of 10% of the value of the train in return for information leading to its location. They would reveal the exact location once the documents were signed. Koper and Richter would later claim information about their discovery was leaked by someone within the government, resulting in a worldwide media circus. \"The media uproar around the 'gold train' was unleashed not by us, finders, but because of the leak of confidential documents that were filed in state offices.\"\n\nOn 28 August, Polish Deputy Culture Minister Piotr Żuchowski announced that ground-penetrating radar images taken by Koper and Richter confirmed with 99% probability that a train of 100 metres in length had been found. However, on August 31, Tomasz Smolarz, Governor of the Lower Silesian Voivodeship, told reporters that \"There is no more proof for this alleged discovery than for other claims made over the years,\" saying, \"It's impossible to claim that such a find actually exists at the location indicated based on the documents that have been submitted.\"\n\nOn 4 September, Koper and Richter went public for the first time, breaking their previous anonymity. They announced that the precise location of the train had been given to Polish authorities. In a bid to assuage doubters, they also released images they had taken with a KS-700 Ground Penetrating Radar system that appeared to show a 50-metre-deep man-made shaft with something in it. Koper and Richter believed the train was buried next to a stretch of track on Polish State Railways' Wrocław–Wałbrzych line at kilometre 65.\n\nPolish authorities sectioned off woodland in the area of kilometre 65, as well as deploying police and other guards in order to prevent access to the numerous treasure hunters who had arrived armed with detection equipment. In late September, the Polish military, acting at the request of the regional governor, began to clear the surface of trees and search for booby traps and mines. The military confirmed on October 4 that no explosives or other dangers existed, down to a metre's depth.\n\nIn mid-November, two different teams were cleared by city authorities in Wałbrzych to make a non-invasive assessment of the site. The first team was Koper and Richter. The second team were mining specialists from the Kraków Mining Academy headed by Janusz Madej. On 15 December, the second team announced that a survey had found no evidence of a train, though possible evidence of a collapsed tunnel. Koper and Richter stood by their claim of a train to which Madej responded \"It's human to make a mistake, but it's foolish to stand by it.\"\n\nIn May 2016, despite outside expert opinion that no train existed, Koper and Richter secured permission to begin digging at the site from the owners of the property, Polish State Railways. The excavation commenced on 15 August 2016 with a team of 64 people, including engineers, geologists, chemists, archaeologists and a specialist in military demolitions. The excavation reportedly cost 116,000 euros or $131,000 and was financed by private sponsors, and with the help of volunteers.\n\nThe dig was halted after seven days when no tracks, tunnel or train were found. The radar images thought to have been the train were revealed to be natural ice formations. An official from the town admitted tourism was up 44% for the year, and said \"the publicity the town has gotten in the global media is worth roughly around $200 million. Our annual budget for promotion is $380,000, so think about that. Whether the explorers find anything or not, that gold train has already arrived.\" The town mayor was considering naming a roundabout after Koper and Richter. The search would continue, according to Koper and Richter, in other nearby locations.\n\nIn 2016, a group of enthusiasts began construction of a full-size replica of a Nazi armored train in an old paper mill located about 15 km from the site of the Koper and Richter embankment dig. It is designed to become a tourist attraction.\n\n\n"}

The war lasted from 1499 to 1503.\n\nThe Turks, under the command of Admiral Kemal Reis, were victorious and forced the Venetians to recognize their gains in 1503.\n\nIn January 1499, Kemal Res set sail from Constantinople with a force of 10 galleys and 4 other types of ships, and in July 1499 met with the huge Ottoman fleet and took over its command in order to wage a large-scale war against the Republic of Venice. The Ottoman fleet consisted of 67 galleys, 20 galliots and about 200 smaller vessels. In August 1499, Kemal Reis defeated the Venetian navy under the command of Antonio Grimani at the Battle of Zonchio (also known as the Battle of Sapienza or the First Battle of Lepanto). It was the first naval battle in history with cannons used on ships, and took place on four separate days: on August 12, 20, 22 and 25, 1499. After reaching the Ionian Sea with the large Ottoman fleet, Kemal Reis encountered the Venetian fleet of 47 galleys, 17 galliots and about 100 smaller vessels under the command of Antonio Grimani near Cape Zonchio and won an important victory. During the battle, Kemal Reis sank the galley of Andrea Loredan, a member of the influential Loredan family of Venice. Antonio Grimani was arrested on 29 September but was eventually released. Grimani later became the Doge of Venice in 1521. The Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II gifted 10 of the captured Venetian galleys to Kemal Reis, who stationed his fleet at the island of Cefalonia between October and December 1499.\n\nOttoman incursions into inland Dalmatia also started in 1499, under command of Isa Pasha and Feriz Beg.\n\nIn December 1499, the Venetians attacked Lepanto with the hope of regaining their lost territories in the Ionian Sea. Kemal Reis set sail from Cefalonia and re-took Lepanto from the Venetians. He stayed in Lepanto between April and May 1500, where his ships were repaired by an army of 15,000 Ottoman craftsmen brought from the area. From there, Kemal Reis set sail and bombarded the Venetian ports on the island of Corfu, and in August 1500 he once again defeated the Venetian fleet at the Battle of Modon. Kemal Reis bombarded the fortress of Modon from the sea and captured the town. He later engaged with the Venetian fleet off the coast of Coron and captured the town along with a Venetian brigantine. From there Kemal Reis sailed towards the Island of Sapientza (Sapienza) and sank the Venetian galley \"Lezza\". In September 1500, Kemal Reis assaulted Voiussa and in October he appeared at Cape Santa Maria on the Island of Lefkada, before ending the campaign and returning to Constantinople in November. With the Battle of Modon, the Turkish fleet and army quickly overwhelmed most of the Venetian possessions in Greece. Modon and Coron, the \"two eyes of the Republic\", were lost. Doge Agostino Barbarigo asked the Pope and the Catholic Monarchs for help, and on 24 December a Spanish–Venetian army commanded by Gonzalo de Córdoba took Cephalonia, temporarily stopping the Ottoman offensive on eastern Venetian territories.\n\nThe Ottoman incursions in Dalmatia escalated to the point where Venice was forced to sign a treaty with Vladislaus II of Hungary and Pope Alexander VI by which they pledged 140,000 ducats a year for the Kingdom of Hungary to actively defend its southern Croatian territories, which aided the defence of Venetian Dalmatia, signed after long negotiations on 13 May 1501. In 1501 Feriz Beg captured Durazzo in Venetian Albania.\n\nBy the end of 1502, Venice and the Ottoman Empire agreed on an armistice. On 31 January 1503, Venice signed another treaty with Vladislaus II, having already paid 124,000 ducats through the previous treaty, to pay 30,000 ducats a year for the same purpose.\n\nIn 1503, Turkish cavalry raids reached Venetian territory in Northern Italy, and Venice was forced to recognize the Ottoman gains, ending the war.\n\nThe economy of the Venetian cities in Dalmatia was severely impacted by the Turkish occupation of the hinterland during this war.\n\nBy September 1510, Vladislaus had received a total of 116,000 ducats under the terms of the second treaty with Venice. After 1508, he had also been under pressure from the League of Cambrai to join them against Venice, but skillful Venetian diplomacy prevented that.\n\n\n\n"}

This fictitious endangered species of cephalopod was given the Latin name \"Octopus paxarbolis\" (the species name being coined from Latin \"pax\", the root of \"Pacific\", and Spanish \"arbol\" meaning \"tree\"). It was purportedly able to live both on land and in water, and was said to live in the Olympic National Forest and nearby rivers, spawning in water where its eggs are laid. Its major predator was said to be the Sasquatch. The Pacific Northwest tree octopus website is among a number of sites commonly used in Internet literacy classes in schools, although it was not created for that purpose.\nLeu et al. (2007) conducted an empirical study on 13-year old US school children’s ability to critically evaluate online information for reliability. The sample included the top quartile of school children (n=53) in samples from the states of Connecticut and South Carolina. Each school child was exposed to the spoof site \"“Save The Northwest Pacific Tree Octopus\"\" (/, devoted to this rare species of octopus, complete with pictures of the animal itself and its environment. The school children then received a short, fictitious, message from another class, asking them to locate and evaluate the reliability of the website. They were to provide three reasons for their answer, and summarize the most important information from that website in one or two sentences. Then they were asked to send their information via IM, email, or to post this on a blog site. Following the activity, school chldren were interviewed to ensure that they were familiar with the term \"reliable,\" an important concept in the task. When asked what this term meant, all responded with answers indicating that they understood the term (e.g., \"It means that you can trust it;\" \"It means it will always be there for you;\" or \"It's like a friend that you can trust\"). See also.\n\nIn the spring of 2017, Loos, Ivan & Leu (2018) replicated the study in a Dutch school class of 27 children (13 girls and 14 boys, 11/12 years old) in the following way: The teacher and the school children were told by the first author of the study that the lesson that would follow would be an online reading comprehension exercise; the real purpose of the lesson was not revealed in advance. The children were asked by the scholar to visit the abovementioned website. They were given the following instructions: “Have a look at this website. Look at the pictures, click on the links if you wish. Do not hurry, you have time enough. And this is not a test. It will not be graded.” The website was automatically translated to Dutch, a facility offered by the chrome notebook they all used. Then, they were asked to answer the following questions: (1) This website presents an octopus living in trees. What country does this animal live in?, (2) According to the website, this particular octopus is an endangered species. For what reason?, (3) If Greenpeace were to ask you to save this octopus, would you support this and sign? YES, because … NO, because … (choose one), (4) Were there parts of the website you didn’t understand? If so, please explain., (5) Are there any other comments about this website you would like to make?\" Hence, these school children thought the text was about their willingness to undertake action for an endangered animal. The pupils who answered ‘YES’ to question (3) were judged as perceiving the site as a reliable one. In this way, it was not necessary to explicitly ask about the reliability of the site, which would have risked priming them. The school children were debriefed after the session and they received a new media literacies training.\nThe 2007 US study found that slightly more than half (27) of the 53 schoolchildren taking part in the study reported the website as being very reliable. Only 6 out of the 53 school children (11%) viewed the website as unreliable. Each of these 6 school children had just participated in a lesson that used this website to teach them to be suspicious of information online. In the 2017 Dutch study only 2 out of the in total 27 schoolchildren (7%) recognized that the website was a hoax. The setting of the task (school environment), the trust in their teacher and the scholar, and the emotional involvement (the topic was an animal in danger) might have made it more difficult for them to perceive the information on the website as fake. Several told the scholar they were shocked that they had considered the digital information on the website to be reliable, as they had received several new literacies training at school over the past year.\n\n"}

The song was taken from their debut album, \"Sleep in Safety\". However, the single version, dubbed \"Partytime (The Story of Sabine)\", is shorter in length and notably heavier, with more smoothly flowing lyrics and a shorter introduction. This single version was included on the 1993 reissue of \"Sleep in Safety\". \n\n\"Partytime\" is probably 45 Grave's most well-known song, having been used as the theme song to the 1985 film \"The Return of the Living Dead\" and featured on the soundtrack. This \"Zombie Version\" was shorter and heavier than both previous versions of the song, and eschewed the story of the previous versions. Another version, featured on compilations \"Autopsy\", \"Debasement Tapes\" and \"A Devil's Possessions\", has a different vocal melody and is introduced with laughter and different lyrics.\n\nThe A-side, \"School's Out,\" a cover of the Alice Cooper song of the same name, was featured as a bonus track on the re-released version of \"Sleep in Safety\". This version differs little from Cooper's original, but makes use of keyboards.\n\nThe song is about a 5-year-old girl who is brutally raped, abused and killed by her mother and friends, and the events that followed. As Dinah Cancer explained: \"It's based on a story that I read in a true crime mag. The insanity and cruelty went on. So that 'Partytime' is about child abuse but it is written as a tribute to the little girl, Sabine. The song is about what her family did to her and how she didn't deserve it\".\n\n\"Partytime\" was notably used in the 1985 film \"The Return of the Living Dead\", and was later used during the \"\" \"Call of the Dead\" trailer.\n\n\n"}

In the United States, polar bear plunges are usually held to raise money for a charitable organization. In Canada, polar bear swims are usually held on New Year's Day to celebrate the new year.\n\nIn Canada, \"Polar Bear Swims\", \"plunges\" or \"dips\" are a New Year's Day tradition in numerous communities across the country. Vancouver, BC's annual Polar Bear Swim Club has been active since 1920 and typically has 1,000 to 2,000 registered participants, with a record 2,128 plunging into English Bay in 2000. Registration is not enforced and the actual number of swimmers may be significantly higher. Estimates of the number of observers are typically up to 10,000. Suburban White Rock, BC's was founded in 1958, and other suburbs including North Vancouver, Surrey, Delta and Langley also hold swims.\n\nOther locations include Bowen Island, BC, Edmonton, AB, Calgary, AB, Ottawa, ON, Oakville, ON, Toronto, ON, Perth, ON, Clarington, ON, Sarnia, ON, Montreal, QC, North Hatley, QC, Halifax, NS, Prince Edward Island, Ness Lake north of Prince George, BC and St. John's, NL. In Yellowknife, NWT, the \"Freezin for a Reason\" plunge is held in March after the spring thaw.\n\nEvery New Year's Day around 10,000 people dive collectively into the icy cold sea water at Scheveningen, a Dutch beach resort town, since 1960. In 89 locations on beaches and in lakes all over the country, each year around 30,000 people participate in this \"Nieuwjaarsduik\" (English: New Year's dive), with a record 36,000 participants on January 1, 2012. Since 1998, Unox, a Unilever food brand often associated with winter, adopted the Nieuwjaarsduik and ever since it is tradition to wear Unox branded winter caps and gloves.\n\nPolar plunges (the local name) are held at various beaches in New Zealand, usually on the weekend closest to the shortest day in late June. Among other places, polar plunges are led at Papamoa Beach (Tauranga), Saint Clair Beach (Dunedin), and Castlecliff (Wanganui).\n\nAn annual \"Loony Dook\" takes place in South Queensferry, Scotland, on New Year's Day. Several thousand attend the event with over one thousand taking the plunge. Participants regularly dress up for the occasion and will usually parade through the local town acting like \"loonies\" proceeding the \"dook\". Aside from the regular enthusiasts, most are still inebriated from New Year's Eve celebrations and have more than likely lost a bet.\n\nAnother, smaller plunge occurs on Christmas Day at Blackroot Pool in Sutton Park, Birmingham, England. Often, participants aim to raise money for charity.\n\nIn the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, an annual swim is held on Boxing Day.\n\nPlunges are now held across the United States. Annual events are held in Seattle (since 1993), Evergreen, Colorado\nNew York's Coney Island Polar Bear Club, Lake George, NY,\nBoston (since 1904), Milwaukee's Bradford Beach (since 1916), New Hampshire, and New Jersey. Some, such as Minnesota's, are held to raise proceeds for the Special Olympics. Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College also organizes an annual \"Polar Plunge for Health Equity\" into Occom Pond.\n\nThe Polar Bear Plunge event in Maryland, the largest polar bear plunge in the United States, held annually at Sandy Point State Park, raises funds for the Special Olympics. Sponsored by the Maryland State Police, in 2007, Plungapalooza raised $2.2 million and had 7,400 participants. In 2008, an estimated 12,000 people participated.\n\nEvery Super Bowl Sunday, Long Beach, New York hosts one of the largest in the US. Since 1998 thousands of people have flocked to the beaches of Long Beach to jump into the ocean on Super Bowl Sunday. All proceeds are donated to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\nFrom February to March each year, Polar Plunges are held in numerous locations throughout the state of Illinois. Donations and proceeds raised for the Special Olympics.\n\nAn annual Polar Bear Swimming Contest takes place annually at the Haeundae Beach in Busan, South Korea.\n\nA polar plunge is also held every midsummer in Antarctica – a rite of passage for scientists and visitors to New Zealand's Scott Base.

Baloch rose to prominence due to her videos on social networks discussing her daily routine and various controversial issues.\n\nBaloch first received recognition from the media in 2013, when she auditioned for \"Pakistan Idol\"; her audition went viral and she became an Internet celebrity. She was one of the top 10 most searched for persons on the internet in Pakistan and both celebrated and criticised for the content of her videos and posts.\n\nDuring the evening of 15 July 2016, Baloch was asphyxiated while she was asleep in the house where her parents live in Multan. Her brother Waseem Azeem confessed to the murder saying she was \"bringing disrepute\" to the \"family's honour\".\n\nBaloch was born on 1 March 1990 in Dera Ghazi Khan, Punjab. She hailed from Shah Sadar Din. and an underprivileged family and had six brothers and two sisters. Her first job was as a bus hostess.\n\nBaloch's fame was based on her social media posts – pictures, videos and comments. These were considered bold and outrageous by the largely conservative Pakistani community. Her most popular videos were those of her with her catchphrase \"How em luking?\"(How am I looking?) and those of her saying \"Maire sar mai pain ho raha hai\" (I'm getting a headache) in a funny and catchy tone. Her catchphrases became viral and were used by the Pakistani youth in enjoyment. They were also featured of dubbing social media site dubsmash and became widely popular among Indian and Pakistani youth alike. Some international news media compared her to Kim Kardashian; however, local commentators stated that she was more significant than Kardashian, as Baloch \"went against the norms of society\" and lived life on her own terms. She started to appear on Pakistani talk shows regularly by 2014, either to perform songs or to discuss her rising social media popularity. During her life she served as digital manager at Neptuner Web Solutions in 2016\n\nIn June 2016, Baloch met senior cleric Mufti Abdul Qawi in a hotel room to learn more about her faith; the interaction between them brought about mayhem on social media platforms as their photos went viral online. She also wore a hat with the Mufti's signature. The meeting led to the Mufti being suspended from his position on one of Pakistan's religious committees, and to Baloch being a regular on popular Pakistani current affairs and news programmes. She appeared on various popular Pakistani TV shows with senior anchors such as Mubashir Lucman. She would mostly be on talk shows debating with religious scholars on her western and controversial acts and lifestyle.\n\nA previous stunt which went viral on social media was her promise to strip dance for her followers and to dedicate her dance to cricketer Shahid Afridi if Pakistan won the Twenty20 match against India on 19 March 2016. She released a teaser on social media, which went viral, but Pakistan lost the match. Some Indian media compared her with Poonam Pandey at this point due to her controversial personality.\n\nAs her media presence grew, Baloch began to use her position to comment on women's position in Pakistani society. The week before she died, she released a music video entitled \"Ban,\" which mocked the restrictions placed on women in the country. In an interview with controversial anchor Mubashir Luqman, Baloch named Sunny Leone, Rakhi Sawant and Poonam Pandey as her inspirations. She also said that many organizations, people and media groups were calling her to feature in their shows to increase their own ratings.\n\nFollowing the June 2016 meeting with Qawi, Baloch kept a press conference and reported that she received death threats both from him and from others, and demanded police protection from the state.\n\nAt around the same time, Baloch's ex-husband described in the media their brief marriage, revealing intimate details of their relationship. Baloch claimed her husband had been abusive, and cried publicly about the pain of the marriage. Around 14 July 2016, Baloch spoke by phone to a reporter from the \"Express Tribune\" paper and stated that she feared for her life. She told the reporter that she had sought protection from the police but on receiving no response, had decided to move abroad with her parents after the Eid al-Fitr holiday as she felt unsafe in Pakistan.\n\nBaloch married Aashiq Hussain in 2008, aged 17, and had one son with him. Baloch left her husband a year later, saying he was abusive. There are reports Baloch was separated from a second marriage.\n\nOn 15 July 2016, Qandeel Baloch was drugged and then asphyxiated by her brother M. Waseem while she was asleep at her parents' home in Multan. Her death was reported by her father Azeem. It was first reported as a shooting, but an autopsy report confirmed that Baloch was murdered by asphyxiation while she was asleep, on the night of 15–16 July, around 11:15 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. By the time her body was found she had already been dead for between fifteen and thirty-six hours. Marks on Baloch's body revealed that her mouth and nose were pinned shut to asphyxiate her. Police said that they would investigate all sides of the murder including honour killing.\n\nA First Information Report against her brother Waseem and another brother Aslam Shaheen, who allegedly persuaded Waseem to kill their sister, was issued. Baloch's father Azeem stated in the FIR that his sons Aslam Shaheen and Waseem were responsible for their sister’s death and had killed her for her money. Her father told the press \"my daughter was brave and I will not forget or forgive her brutal murder.\"\n\nWaseem was arrested on the evening of 16 July. He confessed to murdering his sister, saying \"she [Qandeel Baloch] was bringing disrepute to our family's honour and I could not tolerate it any further. I killed her around 11:30 p.m. on Friday night when everyone else had gone to bed. My brother is not involved in the murder.\"\n\nThe state was named as complainant in her murder case, making it impossible for the victim's family to pardon the perpetrator (see the Pakistani \"diyaa\" law). An Islamic cleric, Mufti Abdul Qavi's has been mentioned in the case's First Information Report (FIR) by her father. The cleric was previously involved and already being investigated by the Multan police at the time of murder.\n\nBaloch's murder was widely condemned by media celebrities and people around the globe, while some in Pakistan were more inclined to support her murder. Several personalities, including Madonna, Khloé Kardashian, Miley Cyrus, Jamie Lee Curtis, Faryal Fatima, Rakhi Sawant, Imran Khan, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Sharmila Farooqi, Abdul Razaque, Reham Khan, Sanam Baloch, Osman Khalid Butt, Meesha Shafi, Sabz Khan; UK Radio broadcaster on Allfm.org and Published author on Pakistani issues, Nadia Hussain, Ali Zafar, along with many others condemned the incident, including filmmaker and activist Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy who said, \"I really feel that no woman is safe in this country, until we start making examples of people, until we start sending men who kill women to jail, unless we literally say there will be no more killing and those who dare will spend the rest of their lives behind bars.\" She further said, \"There is not a single day where you don't pick up a paper and see a woman hasn't been killed... this is an epidemic.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May also condemned the murder saying \"there is absolutely no honour in so-called honour killings and they should be referred to as acts of terror.\" May also said it was 'criminal' for women to be murdered by their male relatives on the grounds of defending family 'honour'. The daughter of the Pakistani ex-Prime Minister Maryam Nawaz announced that the government had finalized the draft law against honour killings in the light of negotiations and the final draft will be presented to a committee of joint session of parliament on July 21 for consideration and approval.”\n\nVigils for Baloch were held in Lahore and Karachi. On November 2, 2017, the father of Qandeel Baloch submitted an application to police alleging that his life was in danger from those who planned his daughter's murder.\n\nBaloch's death has drawn mixed reactions from different sections of society in Pakistan. Some called her death an honour killing and some think that the motive was money. An episode in the A-Plus Entertainment series \"Yeh Junoon\" was partially based on her life. The series starred Zhalay Sarhadi and Shamoon Abbasi in lead roles. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy's untitled documentary film on her life is under production, that will be released in 2017.\n\nOn July 27. 2017, Urdu1 started to air a 28-episode biopic television drama titled \"Baaghi\" (meaning \"Rebel\" in Urdu) based on Qandeel's life, where Saba Qamar plays her character. The first episode amassed more than 1,200,000 views on YouTube. \nIn 2016, Dawn reported that Baloch biography page on Wikipedia was the fourth most read amongst Pakistani personalities in 2016.\n\nIn March 2017, The British-Pakistani/Indian-American hip hop group Swet Shop Boys dedicated the track \"Aaja\" from their latest album in the memory of Qandeel Baloch. Recorded samples of her voice from her social media content is also used towards the end of the track.\n\nThe musical band Bumbu Sauce also released a song on Qandeel Baloch entitled \"Vuzzeerrayazam\", which gives Qandeel the titles of ‘Prime Minister’ and ‘Qoum ki beti'.\n\nOn June 2017, a documentary film \"Undercover Asia S4: In The Name Of Honour\" premiered on Channel NewsAsia. Produced by MAKE Productions, it tells how Baloch's bold and sexy videos challenged convention and shocked a nation which later led to fatal consequences.\n\n\n"}

For a period of time, it held a place in the \"Guinness Book of Records\" as the largest outdoor \"rock concert\" in history, with figures varying from 1 to 1.5 million in attendance. Rendez-vous Houston is remembered for being the concert which celebrated the astronauts of the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster, which had happened only two and a half months earlier. One of Jarre's friends, astronaut Ron McNair, had been killed in the disaster. He was supposed to play the saxophone from space during the track \"Last Rendez-Vous\"; his substitute for the concert was Houston native Kirk Whalum.\n\nIn 1985, Jarre was contacted by the musical director of the Houston Grand Opera with the proposal for him related to the celebrations of Texas' 150th birthday in 1986, 150th birthday of the city of Houston and NASA's 25th birthday. Because of NASA's involvement, Jarre got the chance to keep in contact with a friend of his, astronaut captain Bruce McCandless II who later introduced Jarre to a flight companion of his, astronaut and jazz musician Ron McNair. Together they had the idea that for the celebrations, Jarre would create a piece of music that could be performed by McNair on his saxophone. The idea was that McNair, on his next trip into space in the \"Challenger\" Space Shuttle, would perform (and record onto video) the new piece of music, which would then be projected (through video playback) onto a giant screen that was to be constructed on the front of one of the buildings.\nOn January 28, 1986, McNair telephoned Jarre for the last time. \"...Everything's ready. See you in a week's time. Watch me on TV for the takeoff!\" On that same day, an appalled world witnessed a historic tragedy - the \"Challenger\" Space Shuttle disintegrated in mid-air while on its ascent into space. Distraught by what happened, Jarre almost decided to cancel the concert. However, astronauts from NASA (including Bruce McCandless) telephoned Jarre. They asked Jarre not to cancel, as now the concert \"must\" go ahead, and be held in tribute to pay respect to the astronauts who had lost their lives in the disaster.\n\nThe run-up to the concert itself still did not go smoothly. Rain poured down on Houston a couple of days before the concert, destroying much of the equipment on stage (which was repaired by the day of the concert), breaking wires and ruining instruments. Furthermore, there had been a very strong wind blowing all week, which ended up splitting open the giant projection screen (which was made from several small canvas panels) and causing it to come crashing down.\n\nThe local police turned up during the middle of a rehearsal demanding immediate payment of a fine; the residents who lived nearby were complaining of excessive noise and were exhausted from their sleepless nights. Also, FBI officers threatened to put a stop to the whole proceedings because they were being deprived of electricity. 30 large lamps had been installed on top of FBI headquarters, and they were causing problems with their surveillance of Colonel Gaddafi, who was visiting the city at that time.\n\nThere was still one more slight problem before the concert started. The chief of the Houston Fire Department, Robert Clayton, had told Francis Dreyfus, Jarre's manager, that the show must be cancelled. This was due to a change of the wind direction; the Chief was concerned that the crowd would be showered with firework debris. After some back-and-forth argument with Dreyfus, Clayton agreed that the concert could proceed on a 'see how it goes' term.\n\nDuring the concert (specifically, during the performance of Equinoxe Part 5), the amount of fireworks being used and the direction of the wind did indeed cause debris to rain down on the audience, covering them in ash. Clayton frantically began to try to stop the proceedings, fearing that people would be injured. Although his fears were duly noted, the crowd took no notice of the ash falling onto them and carried on enjoying the concert proceedings.\n\n\nRural Space\n\n\nUrban Space\n\n\nOuter Space\n\n\n\n\n"}

The 2nd SEE SDEWES Conference was held in Piran.\n\nNew section of SDEWES Centre is established in Skopje, Macedonia, with the goal to gather professionals and scientists from broad range of disciplines, particularly located in the Southeast Europe, in order to provide scientific support for wise policy-making. SDEWES-Skopje aims to extend the activities at regional level including the other EU candidate and potential candidate countries, as well as EU neighbourhood countries to foster regional coordination in providing feasible solutions for the common challenges and gaining synergy effects.\nAccording to the Statute of SDEWES Centre, every person can under the same circumstances apply for membership.\n\nUp to 2011, SDEWES Conference was organized as biennial conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia. From the year 2012, it is an annual event but with a geographic regime. Every two years the conference is held in Dubrovnik, and in the years between on different locations.\n\nThe SDEWES 2012 Conference was held in Ohrid, and in 2014 on a cruise ship travelling between Venice and Istanbul.\n\nIn 2014, the first regional SEE SDEWES conference was held in Ohrid, Macedonia focused on South East Europe.\n\nIn 2015, the 10th Conference on SDEWES was held in Dubrovnik. 540 scientists from over 65 countries participated.\n\nIn 2016, the second regional SEE SDEWES conference was held in Piran, Slovenia.\n\nAlso in 2016, the 11th SDEWES Conference was held in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nIn 2017, the 12th SDEWES Conference will be held in Dubrovnik.\n\nIn 2018, the 1st LATIN AMERICAN SDEWES Conference will be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\nWork presented at the conferences are published in scientific journals and among them, in the Journal of Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems \n\nSDEWES Centre is publishing research open access Journal of Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems since 2013.\n\nSDEWES Centre forms research teams from the pool of members to participate in research projects. SDEWES Centre is involved in two FP7 projects, one Horizon 2020 project and one project under the European Strategy for Danube Region (EUSDR) fund START.\n\nIn line with the aims of the SDEWES Center, an index is also developed to benchmark the performance of cities across aspects that are related to energy, water and environment systems. With the namesake of the Center, the SDEWES Index consists of 7 dimensions, 35 indicators, and close to 20 sub-indicators. It is currently applied to 58 cities.\n\n"}

From its inception in 2004 to 2009, the parade included 25 floats and started at San Francisco's 2nd and Market Streets. The parade continued all the way to San Francisco Civic Center Plaza. The 2009 parade drew over 100,000 people.\n\nThe parade has its origins in Berlin's Loveparade which began in 1989. In 2003, the city denied the parade a permit and the event moved to San Francisco. In 2004, when German organizers were able to secure permits back in Berlin, North American organizers decided to continue their own event and dubbed it the LoveFest. In 2009 the name was changed to LovEvolution to avoid confusion with a similarly named electronic music event in LA.\n\nIn 2009 the permit for LovEvolution was revoked by officials in San Francisco citing safety concerns. Unable to find a suitable venue after the permits were revoked the event was cancelled in 2010 and moved to Oakland the following year and became a paid event. Since 2011 the parade has not been held and its website states it is looking for a venue.\n\nArtists who have performed at LovEvolution Afterparty in previous years include Deadmau5, Above & Beyond, DJ Rap, Kaskade, ATB, Armin Van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Gabriel & Dresden, Kyau & Albert, Deep Voices, Dave Dresden, Green Velvet, Paul Oakenfold, Christopher Lawrence, Junkie XL, Andy Moor, Bad Boy Bill, DJ Dan, Donald Glaude, Dieselboy, Aphrodite, DJ Sasha, John 00 Fleming, Eddie Halliwell, DJ Icey, Mr. Becker, Sector -7G and Robert Nickson.\n\n\n"}

On May 1, protests on college campuses and in cities throughout the U.S. began. In Seattle, over a thousand protestors gathered at the Federal Courthouse and cheered speakers. \"At the University of Maryland, an estimated 1,500 students vandalized an armory building where Air Force ROTC classes were held. And at the University of Cincinnati, a number of demonstrators were arrested after they conducted a sit-in and blocked a busy intersection in the middle of the city. Other students such as at Princeton University protested by cutting classes and sought to organize a nationwide student strike.\"\n\nAt Kent State University, a demonstration with about 500 students was held on the Commons. On May 2, students burned down the ROTC building at Kent State. On May 4, poorly trained National Guardsmen confronted and killed four students during a large protest demonstration at the college. Soon, more than 450 university, college and high school campuses across the country were shut down by student strikes and both violent and non-violent protests that involved more than 4 million students.<ref name=\"Reed, NYT, 5/16/1970\">Roy Reed, Special to \"The New York Times\", \"F.B.I. Investigating Killing Of 2 Negroes in Jackson :Two Negro Students Are Killed In Clash With Police in Jackson\", \"New York Times\" (1857-Current file) [serial online]. May 16, 1970:1. Available from: ProQuest Historical Newspapers The New York Times (1851 - 2006). Accessed July 28, 2012, Document ID: 80023683.</ref>\n\nWhile opposition to the Vietnam War had been simmering on American campuses for several years, and the idea of a strike had been introduced by the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam, which advocated a general strike on the 15th of every month until the war ended, the Kent State shootings seemed to provide the spark for students across the US to adopt the strike tactic.\n\nOn May 8, ten days after Nixon announced the Cambodian invasion (and 4 days after the Kent State shootings), 100,000 protesters gathered in Washington and another 150,000 in San Francisco. Nationwide, students turned their anger on what was often the nearest military facility—college and university Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) offices. All told, 30 ROTC buildings went up in flames or were bombed. There were violent clashes between students and police at 26 schools and National Guard units were mobilized on 21 campuses in 16 states.\n\nFor the most part, however, the protests were peaceful — if often tense. Students at New York University, for example, hung a banner out of a window which read \"They Can't Kill Us All.\"\n\nThe protests and strikes had a dramatic impact, and convinced many Americans, particularly within the administration of President Richard Nixon, that the nation was on the verge of insurrection. Ray Price, Nixon's chief speechwriter from 1969–74, recalled the Washington demonstrations saying, \"The city was an armed camp. The mobs were smashing windows, slashing tires, dragging parked cars into intersections, even throwing bedsprings off overpasses into the traffic down below. This was the quote, student protest. That's not student protest, that’s civil war.\"\n\nNot only was Nixon taken to Camp David for two days for his own protection, but Charles Colson (Counsel to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973) stated that the military was called up to protect the administration from the angry students, he recalled that \"The 82nd Airborne was in the basement of the executive office building, so I went down just to talk to some of the guys and walk among them, and they're lying on the floor leaning on their packs and their helmets and their cartridge belts and their rifles cocked and you’re thinking, 'This can't be the United States of America. This is not the greatest free democracy in the world. This is a nation at war with itself.'\"\n\nThe student protests in Washington also prompted a peculiar and memorable attempt by President Nixon to reach out to the disaffected students. As historian Stanley Karnow reported in his \"Vietnam: A History,\" on May 9, 1970 the President appeared at 4:15 a.m. on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to discuss the war with 30 student dissidents who were conducting a vigil there. Nixon \"treated them to a clumsy and condescending monologue, which he made public in an awkward attempt to display his benevolence.\" Nixon had been trailed by White House Deputy for Domestic Affairs Egil Krogh, who saw it differently than Karnow, saying, \"I thought it was a very significant and major effort to reach out.\"\n\nIn any regard, neither side could convince the other and after meeting with the students Nixon expressed that those in the anti-war movement were the pawns of foreign communists. After the student protests, Nixon asked H. R. Haldeman to consider the Huston Plan, which would have used illegal procedures to gather information on the leaders of the anti-war movement. Only the resistance of FBI head J. Edgar Hoover stopped the plan.\n\nAs a direct result of the student strike, on June 13, 1970, President Nixon established the President's Commission on Campus Unrest, which became known as the Scranton Commission after its chairman, former Pennsylvania governor William Scranton. Scranton was asked to study the dissent, disorder, and violence breaking out on college and university campuses.\n\nThe student protests provoked supporters of the Vietnam War and the Nixon Administration to demonstrate in their own right. In contrast to the noisy student protests, Administration supporters viewed themselves as \"the Silent Majority\" (a phrase coined by Nixon speechwriter Patrick Buchanan).\n\nIn one instance, in New York City on May 8, construction workers attacked student protesters in what came to be called the Hard Hat Riot.\n\n\n"}

Profoundly Deaf driver Caleb McDuff currently competes in the series.\n\nThe first Super 1 meeting was held in 1983 at Snetterton where only 4 classes were run as part of the championship. At the time, the championship was not officially recognised as being the \"British Championship\" as the RAC national titles were decided over a one-weekend event. This continued up till 1990 when Super 1 secured the rights to decide the British champion over the course of the series.\n\nOver the years, the Super 1 series has produced champions that have gone on to race in Formula 1 such as David Coulthard, Will Stevens, Allan McNish, Jenson Button, Anthony Davidson, Paul di Resta, Ralph Firman and Lewis Hamilton. Other drivers who have won a Super 1 championship and who have gone on to professional motor racing include Gary Paffett, Mike Conway, Dan Wheldon, Ben Hanley and Oliver Jarvis\n\nOriginally, there were only 4 classes in the Super 1 series. In 2017, 11 different classes ran within the series over 11 different race weekends. \n\nFor drivers from 6 years of age up to the year of their 8th birthday.\n\n\nFor drivers from 8 years of age up to and including the year of their 13th birthday.\n\n\nFor drivers from 12 years of age up to and including the year of their 17th birthday.\n\n\nFor drivers over 16 years of age.\n\n\nThe OK classes, as well as the TKM classes, are recognised by the Motorsports Association as being British Championships. The remaining are recognised by the Association of British Kart Clubs (ABkC) as National Championships.

Susie was found to be suffering from severe second and third-degree burns over most of her body; her ears were burned off, and she had a broken jaw and teeth.\n\nAn animal cruelty investigation was launched by Guilford County Animal Control, but due to limited resources the investigation was taken over by a detective with Greensboro Police Department who set up a crimestoppers tip line. After a few months a tip was received and Lashawn Demaro Whitehead was arrested and charged with animal cruelty.\n\nSusie was adopted by Donna Smith Lawrence, who had been seriously injured in an attack by a pit bull, which she had befriended, several months prior. Donna and her husband, Roy, reside in High Point, North Carolina.\n\nThe law reclassifies the \"malicious abuse, torture, or killing\" of an animal from a Class I to a Class H felony, with the ten-month potential period of confinement. LaShawn Whitehead received a two-year prison sentence on conviction of indecent liberties with a minor and burning his girlfriend's personal property, according to records of the North Carolina Department of Correction. At the time abuse of Whitehead's own dog would have netted no jail time, but Whitehead was found guilty of abusing an animal owned by another person, which brought jail time.\nSusie's Law was passed unanimously in both the North Carolina State Senate and North Carolina House of Representatives and was signed into law by North Carolina Governor Beverly Perdue, and took effect on December 1, 2010. Passage was possible through intense citizen involvement when Susie's abuse became public, and fund-raising appeals met with great success.\n\nThe 2013 film \"Susie's Hope\" by Uplifting Entertainment focuses on the Lawrences' story and their work to protect vulnerable animals. Emmanuelle Vaugier, a Canadian, is cast as Donna, Burgess Jenkins, a native of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, as Roy, and Andrea Powell as Ramona Hodges, Donna's close friend and neighbor. Jon Provost, former child actor on CBS's \"Lassie\", appeared as then North Carolina State Senator Don Vaughan, a Democrat from Greensboro who pushed for passage of Susie's Law. Willette Thompson portrays Marsha Williams, the outspoken director of the Guilford County Animal Shelter in Greensboro. The name of LaShawn Whitehead is changed in the film to Shawn Griffin, with Cranston Johnson cast in the part.\n\nNow a certified therapy dog, Susie is regularly taken to schools, churches, and hospitals to warn of the danger of animal abuse and to promote kindness and respect. In 2014, the American Humane Association named Susie its \"Hero Dog\" in the category of \"Dog Therapy\".\n\n"}

In 2014 the events were between 13-26/August.\n\nThe competition consists of two categories: \"Tango de Pista\" (Salon Tango), which has strict rules about the usage of traditional milonga figures, and \"Tango Escenario\" (Stage Tango), which is more choreographic and includes elements from other dance disciplines, such as ballet. Previously the competition was only open to couples consisting of men and women but in 2013 the rules were relaxed to allow same gender couples (man dancing with man, or woman with woman) to enter the competition.\n\nThe World Cup competition is the final leg of a series of pre-competitions held around the world starting from March. Traditionally the city of Buenos Aires and various municipalities choose their own \"Municipal\" champions who get wildcards into the final rounds. The same wildcard advantage is also given to national or regional champions of recognized competitions; These include Uruguay (UY), Chile (Cali, CL), Colombia (Bogota, CO), Brazil (Rio de Janeiro, BR), USA (San Francisco, US), Russia (Moscow, RU), China (Nanjing, CN), Japan (Tokyo, JP), Korea (Seoul, KR), France (Paris, FR), United Kingdom (London, UK), EU (Campeonato Europeo, Italy).\n\nNew municipalities in 2016: Turkey and the region (Istanbul, TR).\n\nThe first edition of the \"Mundial de Tango\" competition was held in 2003.\n\nA closely related and highly influential event is the Buenos Aires City competition. The competition rules state that members of the couple must both have \"DNI\" (i.e. have a resident status of 2 years or more) in Argentina. The competition may be considered somewhat even more demanding because the participants can compete in several dance categories: either Tango Senior (age 40 or older) or Tango Adulto (age 18-39) plus Vals or Milonga. Only couples \"Carlos Estigarribia\" & \"María Laura Sastría\" (2015) and \"Jimena Hoffner\" & \"Fernando Carrasco\" (2008), have won the triple championship. The winners of the tango categories are granted direct access to the final qualifying round in \"Mundial de Tango\". Couples in positions 2 through 5 are granted direct access to the semifinals in \"Mundial de Tango\". These couples represent the city of Buenos Aires in the world cup. The City competition's winners and runners-up are likely to become highly regarded and sought out teachers worldwide.\n\nWorth mentioning is the \"Campeonato inter milongas\" (CIM). In 2015 the milongas of Buenos Aires (El Fulgor de Villa Crespo, Salón Canning, Salón El Pial, Club Sunderland, Club Ciencia y Labor) started arranging monthly competitions whose final culminate in December. There are no restrictions in nationality or residence status of Argentina for the participants. The two monthly winning couples are voted for qualifying rounds and final by the audience and not selected judges.\n\nThis worldwide Argentine Tango championship is held in the last week of August (weeks 34-35).\n\nThe Buenos Aires city competition is held near the end of July (week 30) in the capital of Argentina.\n\nThe competition is held at the beginning of July in Italy and results are reported by the European tango ASD orgranization.\n\nThe competition is held during May–June in London and the results are usually reported in Tangofolly community network. See also homepage of UK Tango Festival and Championship, Facebook Group UK Branch Tango Buenos Aires Festival and Dance World Cup and Twitter account UK Tango Festival.\n\nThese results are national tango championships of Italy held annually in the second week of July. Note that in 2015 the city of Rome started holding their own tango championships similar to Buenos Aires city championships.\n\nThese results are national tango championships of the USA. The event is held annually during the week of Easter.\n\n"}
