The embassy building was set on fire with Molotov cocktails and petrol bombs. During the attacks, the police arrived and dispersed protesters from the embassy premises and extinguished the fire.\n\nThe attacks were later condemned by Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei, and Iranian president Hassan Rouhani. On 24 January, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i announced that around 100 people involved in the attack are in custody by the authorities.\n\nMoments after Sheikh Nimr was executed, the Saudi Arabian chargé d'affaires was summoned to the Iranian Foreign Ministry to protest against the execution. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hossein Jaberi Ansari said the execution of Sheikh Nimr \"who had no means other than speech to pursue his political and religious objectives only shows the depth of imprudence and irresponsibility\". He said that the Saudi government \"supports terrorist movements and Takfiri extremists, while executing and suppressing critics inside the country\".\n\nThe remarks were later condemned by Saudi Arabia as \"hostile\" and the ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador in Riyadh. The ministry expressed \"the kingdom's astonishment and its utter rejection of these hostile statements, which it deemed a blatant intervention in the kingdom's affairs\", according to a statement released by the Saudi Press Agency.\n\nAbout several thousand demonstrators gathered near the embassy on Saturday night to protest and strongly condemn against the execution of Sheikh Nimr. The rally began quietly, but some participants attempted stormed the building by climbing the embassy's fence, breaking down the door, throwing around papers on the roof and seizing the Saudi flag. The protesters chanted, \"Death to the Al Saud [family]\", the ruling family of Saudi Arabia among other slogans. It later turned violently after demonstrators began throwing petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails at the embassy and then broke into the compound. The police arrived and dispersed protesters from the embassy premises and extinguished the fire.\n\nIn Mashhad, Iran's second largest city, demonstrators have also set fire at the Saudi consulate and torn down the Saudi flag.\n\nSupreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei condemned the attacks and known it as \"a very bad and wrong incident\". Also, he declared that: \"like the British embassy attack before it, this was against the country (Iran) and Islam, and I didn't like it.\"\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani condemned the attacks while at the same time he also condemned the execution of Nimr al-Nimr. He blamed the attacks on \"extremist individuals\". He has pledged to protect the security of foreign missions and prosecute those responsible for attacking Saudi diplomatic posts, in a series of messages posted on his Twitter account moments after the attack. On 6 January, President Rouhani has asked the Iranian judiciary to immediately prosecute the attackers invoked. He said by punishing the attackers and those who orchestrated this obvious offense, his government should put an end once and forever to such damage and insults to Iran's dignity and national security.\"\n\nThe Iranian authorities have express regret over the attacks and arrested at least 40 individuals in connection to the attack.\n\nFive days later on January 7, 2016, Iran's foreign ministry made the claim that Saudi warplanes had \"deliberately\" targeted its embassy to Yemen in the city of Sana'a. Iran's report included claims that,\"a number of the building's guards\" had been injured as a result of the bombing. Despite this assertion San'aa residents and the Associated Press have reported that the embassy suffered no visible damage. Currently General Ahmad Asseri from the Saudi-led coalition is investigating Iran's allegations.\n\nOn 24 January, Iranian judiciary spokesman Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i announced on state TV that they arrested around 100 people involved in the attack. Some of them were later released.\n\nAs of the end of July, 2017, five of those tried were sentenced to six months in prison, while five others were handed down three-month sentences.\n\nFollowing the attack, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir announced that they will break off diplomatic relations with Iran, recalling its diplomats from Tehran and declared Iranian diplomats in Riyadh \"personae non grata\", ordering to leave the kingdom within 48 hours.\n\nA day later (on 4 January), Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that they will end air traffic and trade links with Iran and also cutting off all commercial relations with Iran. In addition, the Saudi government has imposed a travel ban on its citizens from visiting Iran. Iranian pilgrims would still be welcome to visit Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina, either for the annual Hajj or at other times of year on the Umrah pilgrimage. However, Saudi Arabia-Iran relations can be restored immediately step-by-step, unless the Iranian government acts \"like a civilized county\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19381958", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19381958", "title": "Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers", "text": "Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers\n\nThe filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by financial services firm Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, remains the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, with Lehman holding over in assets.\n\nThe bank had become so deeply involved in mortgage origination that it had effectively become a real estate hedge fund disguised as an investment bank. At the height of the subprime mortgage crisis, it was exceptionally vulnerable to any downturn in real estate values.\n\nThe bankruptcy triggered a one-day drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 4.5%, the largest decline since the September 11, 2001 attacks.\n\nLehman was one of the first Wall Street firms to move into the business of mortgage origination. In 1997, Lehman bought Colorado-based lender Aurora Loan Services, an Alt-A lender. In 2000, to expand their mortgage origination pipeline, Lehman purchased West Coast subprime mortgage lender BNC Mortgage LLC. Lehman quickly became a force in the subprime market. By 2003 Lehman made $18.2 billion in loans and ranked third in lending. By 2004, this number topped $40 billion. By 2006, Aurora and BNC were lending almost $50 billion per month.\n\nLehman had morphed into a real estate hedge fund disguised as an investment bank. By 2008, Lehman had assets of $680 billion supported by only $22.5 billion of firm capital. From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. In such a highly leveraged structure, a three- to five-percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital.\n\nLehman borrowed significant amounts to fund its investing in the years leading to its bankruptcy in 2008, a process known as leveraging or gearing. A significant portion of this investment was in housing-related assets, making it vulnerable to a downturn in that market. One measure of this risk-taking was its leverage ratio, a measure of the ratio of assets to owners equity, which increased from approximately 24:1 in 2003 to 31:1 by 2007. While generating tremendous profits during the boom, this vulnerable position meant that just a 3–4% decline in the value of its assets would entirely eliminate its book value of equity. Investment banks such as Lehman were not subject to the same regulations applied to depository banks to restrict their risk-taking.\n\nIn August 2007, Lehman closed its subprime lender, BNC Mortgage, eliminating 1,200 positions in 23 locations, and took a $25-million after-tax charge and a $27-million reduction in goodwill. The firm said that poor market conditions in the mortgage space \"necessitated a substantial reduction in its resources and capacity in the subprime space\".\n\nIn 2008, Lehman faced an unprecedented loss due to the continuing subprime mortgage crisis. Lehman's loss resulted from having held onto large positions in subprime and other lower-rated mortgage tranches when securitizing the underlying mortgages. Whether Lehman did this because it was simply unable to sell the lower-rated bonds, or made a conscious decision to hold them, is unclear. In any event, huge losses accrued in lower-rated mortgage-backed securities throughout 2008. In the second fiscal quarter, Lehman reported losses of $2.8 billion and decided to raise $6 billion in additional capital by offering new shares. In the first half of 2008 alone, Lehman stock lost 73% of its value as the credit market continued to tighten. In August 2008, Lehman reported that it intended to release 6% of its work force, 1,500 people, just ahead of its third-quarter-reporting deadline in September.\n\nOn August 22, 2008, shares in Lehman closed up 5% (16% for the week) on reports that the state-controlled Korea Development Bank was considering buying Lehman. Most of those gains were quickly eroded as news emerged that Korea Development Bank was \"facing difficulties pleasing regulators and attracting partners for the deal\". It culminated on September 9, 2008, when Lehman's shares plunged 45% to $7.79, after it was reported that the state-run South Korean firm had put talks on hold.\n\nInvestor confidence continued to erode as Lehman's stock lost roughly half its value and pushed the S&P 500 down 3.4% on September 9, 2008. The Dow Jones lost nearly 300 points the same day, on investors' concerns about the security of the bank. The U.S. government did not announce any plans to assist with any possible financial crisis that emerged at Lehman.\n\nOn September 10, 2008, Lehman announced a loss of $3.9 billion and their intent to sell off a majority stake in their investment-management business, which included Neuberger Berman. The stock slid 7% that day.\n\nOn September 12, 2008, Timothy F. Geithner, then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, called a meeting on the future of Lehman, which included the possibility of an emergency liquidation of its assets. Bankers representing all the major Wall Street firms were in attendance. The meeting goal was to find a private solution in rescuing Lehman and extinguish the flame of the global financial crisis. Lehman reported that it had been in talks with Bank of America and Barclays for the company's possible sale. \"The New York Times\" reported on September 14, 2008, that Barclays had ended its bid to purchase all or part of Lehman and a deal to rescue the bank from liquidation collapsed. It emerged subsequently that a deal had been vetoed by the Bank of England and the UK's Financial Services Authority. Leaders of major Wall Street banks continued to meet late that day to prevent the bank's rapid failure. Bank of America's rumored involvement also appeared to end as federal regulators resisted its request for government involvement in Lehman's sale. By Sunday, after the Barclays deal fell through, the news of impending doom swept through Lehman, and many employees arrived at the headquarters to clean out their offices. By Sunday afternoon, the government summoned Harvey Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges to file for bankruptcy before the markets opened on Monday.\n\nLehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 15, 2008. According to Bloomberg, reports filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan) on September 16 indicated that JPMorgan Chase & Co. provided Lehman Brothers with a total of $138 billion in \"Federal Reserve-backed advances\". The \"Federal Reserve-backed advances\" as provided by JPMorgan Chase were for $87 billion on September 15 and $51 billion on September 16.\n\nThe filing remains the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, with Lehman holding over $600 billion in assets.\n\nOn September 22, 2008, a revised proposal to sell the brokerage part of Lehman Brothers holdings of the deal, was put before the bankruptcy court, with a $1.3666 billion (£700 million) plan for Barclays to acquire the core business of Lehman Brothers (mainly Lehman's $960 million Midtown Manhattan office skyscraper), was approved. Manhattan court bankruptcy Judge James Peck, after a seven-hour hearing, ruled: \"I have to approve this transaction because it is the only available transaction. Lehman Brothers became a victim, in effect the only true icon to fall in a tsunami that has befallen the credit markets. This is the most momentous bankruptcy hearing I've ever sat through. It can never be deemed precedent for future cases. It's hard for me to imagine a similar emergency.\"\n\nLuc Despins, the creditors committee counsel, said: \"The reason we're not objecting is really based on the lack of a viable alternative. We did not support the transaction because there had not been enough time to properly review it.\" In the amended agreement, Barclays would absorb $47.4 billion in securities and assume $45.5 billion in trading liabilities. Lehman's attorney Harvey R. Miller of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, said \"the purchase price for the real estate components of the deal would be $1.29 billion, including $960 million for Lehman's New York headquarters and $330 million for two New Jersey data centers. Further, Barclays will not acquire Lehman's Eagle Energy unit, but will have entities known as Lehman Brothers Canada Inc, Lehman Brothers Sudamerica, Lehman Brothers Uruguay and its Private Investment Management business for high-net-worth individuals. Finally, Lehman will retain $20 billion of securities assets in Lehman Brothers Inc that are not being transferred to Barclays. Barclays had a potential liability of $2.5 billion to be paid as severance, if it chooses not to retain some Lehman employees beyond the guaranteed 90 days.\n\nOn September 22, 2008, Nomura Holdings, Inc. announced it agreed to acquire Lehman Brothers' franchise in the Asia Pacific region including Japan, Hong Kong and Australia. The following day, Nomura announced its intentions to acquire Lehman Brothers' investment banking and equities businesses in Europe and the Middle East. A few weeks later it was announced that conditions to the deal had been met, and the deal became legally effective on Monday, October 13. In 2007, non-US subsidiaries of Lehman Brothers were responsible for over 50% of global revenue produced.\n\nThe Dow Jones closed down just over 500 points (−4.4%) on September 15, 2008, at the time the largest drop by points in a single day since the days following the attacks on September 11, 2001. (This drop was subsequently exceeded by an even larger −7.0% plunge on September 29, 2008.)\nLehman's bankruptcy was expected to cause some depreciation in the price of commercial real estate. The prospect for Lehman's $4.3 billion in mortgage securities getting liquidated sparked a selloff in the commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) market. Additional pressure to sell securities in commercial real estate was feared as Lehman got closer to liquidating its assets. Apartment-building investors were also expected to feel pressure to sell as Lehman unloaded its debt and equity pieces of the $22 billion purchase of Archstone, the third-largest United States real estate investment trust (REIT). Archstone's core business was the ownership and management of residential apartment buildings in major metropolitan areas of the United States. Jeffrey Spector, a real-estate analyst at UBS said that in markets with apartment buildings that compete with Archstone, \"there is no question that if you need to sell assets, you will try to get ahead\" of the Lehman selloff, adding \"Every day that goes by there will be more pressure on pricing.\"\nSeveral money funds and institutional cash funds had significant exposure to Lehman with the institutional cash fund run by The Bank of New York Mellon and the Reserve Primary Fund, a money market fund, both falling below $1 per share, called \"breaking the buck\", following losses on their holdings of Lehman assets. In a statement The Bank of New York Mellon said its fund had isolated the Lehman assets in a separate structure. It said the assets accounted for 1.13% of its fund. The Primary Reserve Fund owned $785 million or 1.2 percent of its holdings in Lehman commercial paper. The drop in the Primary Reserve Fund was the first time since 1994 that a money-market fund had dropped below the $1-per-share level.\n\nOn Monday, September 15, 2008, the market staged a run on AIG with shares plummeting 61 percent. Shareholders also fled from Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Two weeks later, the Fed agreed to give them bank holding company status which provided vital access to the Fed discount window.\n\nPutnam Investments, a unit of Canada's Great-West Lifeco, shut a $12.3 billion money-market fund as it faced \"significant redemption pressure\" on September 17, 2008. Evergreen Investments said its parent Wachovia Corporation would \"support\" three Evergreen money-market funds to prevent their shares from falling. This move to cover $494 million of Lehman assets in the funds also raised fears about Wachovia's ability to raise capital.\nClose to 100 hedge funds used Lehman as their prime broker and relied largely on the firm for financing. In an attempt to meet their own credit needs, Lehman Brothers International routinely re-hypothecated the assets of their hedge funds clients that utilized their prime brokerage services. Lehman Brothers International held close to 40 billion dollars of clients assets when it filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. Of this, 22 billion had been re-hypothecated. As administrators took charge of the London business and the U.S. holding company filed for bankruptcy, positions held by those hedge funds at Lehman were frozen. As a result, the hedge funds were forced to de-lever and sit on large cash balances, inhibiting chances at further growth. This in turn created further market dislocation and overall systemic risk, resulting in a 737 billion dollar decline in collateral outstanding in the securities lending market.\n\nIn Japan, banks and insurers announced a combined 249 billion yen ($2.4 billion) in potential losses tied to the Lehman shock. Mizuho Trust & Banking Co. cut its profit forecast by more than half, citing 11.8 billion yen in losses on bonds and loans linked to Lehman. The Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said, \"Most lending to Lehman Brothers was made by major Japanese banks, and their possible losses seem to be within the levels that can be covered by their profits,\" adding, \"There is no concern that the latest events will threaten the stability of Japan's financial system.\" During bankruptcy proceedings a lawyer from The Royal Bank of Scotland Group said the company was facing between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion in claims against Lehman partially based on an unsecured guarantee from Lehman and connected to trading losses with Lehman subsidiaries, Martin Bienenstock.\nLehman was a counterparty to mortgage financier Freddie Mac in unsecured lending transactions that matured on September 15, 2008. Freddie said it had not received principal payments of $1.2 billion plus accrued interest. Freddie said it had further potential exposure to Lehman of about $400 million related to the servicing of single-family home loans, including repurchasing obligations. Freddie also said it \"does not know whether and to what extent it will sustain a loss relating to the transactions\" and warned that \"actual losses could materially exceed current estimates.\" Freddie was still in the process of evaluating its exposure to Lehman and its affiliates under other business relationships.\nAfter Constellation Energy was reported to have exposure to Lehman, its stock went down 56% in the first day of trading having started at $67.87. The massive drop in stocks led to the New York Stock Exchange halting trade of Constellation. The next day, as the stock plummeted as low as $13 per share, Constellation announced it was hiring Morgan Stanley and UBS to advise it on \"strategic alternatives\", suggesting a buyout. While rumors suggested French power company Électricité de France would buy the company or increase its stake, Constellation ultimately agreed to a buyout by MidAmerican Energy, part of Berkshire Hathaway (headed by billionaire Warren Buffett).\nThe Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation or Farmer Mac said it would have to write off $52.4 million in Lehman debt in the form of senior debt securities it owned as a result of the bankruptcy. Farmer Mac said it might not be in compliance with its minimum capital requirements at the end of September.\n\nIn Hong Kong more than 43,700 individuals in the city had invested in HK$15.7 billion of \"guaranteed mini-bonds\" (迷你債券) from Lehman. Many claim that banks and brokers mis-sold them as low-risk. Conversely, bankers note that minibonds are indeed low-risk instruments since they were backed by Lehman Brothers, which until just months before its collapse was a venerable member of Wall Street with high credit and investment ratings. The default of Lehman Brothers was a low probability event, which was totally unexpected. Indeed, many banks accepted minibonds as collateral for loans and credit facilities. Another HK$3 billion was invested in similar like derivatives. The Hong Kong government proposed a plan to buy back the investments at their current estimated value, which would allow investors to partially recover some of their loss by the end of the year. HK chief executive Donald Tsang insisted the local banks respond swiftly to the government buy-back proposal as the Monetary Authority received more than 16,000 complaints. On October 17, He Guangbe, chairman of the Hong Kong Association of Banks, agreed to buy back the bonds, which were priced using an agreed upon methodology based on its estimated current value. This episode had deep repercussions on the banking industry, where misguided investor sentiments became hostile to both wealth management products as well as the banking industry as a whole. Under intense pressure from the public, all political parties came out in support of the investors, further fanning distrust towards the banking industry.\n\nNeuberger Berman Inc., through its subsidiaries, primarily Neuberger Berman, LLC, is an investment-advisory firm founded in 1939 by Roy R. Neuberger and Robert Berman, to manage money for high-net-worth individuals. In the decades that followed, the firm's growth mirrored that of the asset-management industry as a whole. In 1950, it introduced one of the first no-load mutual funds in the United States, the Guardian Fund, and also began to manage the assets of pension plans and other institutions. Historically known for its value-investing style, in the 1990s the firm began to diversify its competencies to include additional value and growth investing, across the entire capitalization spectrum, as well as new investment categories, such as international, real-estate investment trusts and high-yield investments. In addition, with the creation of a nationally and several state-chartered trust companies, the firm became able to offer trust and fiduciary services. In 2016, the firm had approximately $246 billion in assets under management.\nIn October 1999, the firm conducted an initial public offering of its shares and commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker symbol \"NEU\". In July 2003, shortly after the retired Mr. Neuberger's 100th birthday, the company announced that it was in merger discussions with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. These discussions ultimately resulted in the firm's acquisition by Lehman on October 31, 2003, for approximately $2.63 billion in cash and securities. \nOn November 20, 2006, Lehman announced its Neuberger Berman subsidiary would acquire H. A. Schupf & Co., a money-management firm targeted at wealthy individuals. Its $2.5 billion of assets would join Neuberger's $50 billion in high-net-worth client assets under management.\nAn article in The Wall Street Journal on September 15, 2008, announcing that Lehman Brothers Holdings filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, quoted Lehman officials regarding Neuberger Berman: \"Neuberger Berman LLC and Lehman Brothers Asset Management will continue to conduct business as usual and will not be subject to the bankruptcy case of the parent company, and its portfolio management, research and operating functions remain intact. In addition, fully paid securities of customers of Neuberger Berman are segregated from the assets of Lehman Brothers and aren't subject to the claims of Lehman Brothers Holdings' creditors, Lehman said.\"\nJust before the collapse of Lehman Brothers, executives at Neuberger Berman sent e-mail memos suggesting, among other things, that the Lehman Brothers' top people forgo multimillion-dollar bonuses to \"send a strong message to both employees and investors that management is not shirking accountability for recent performance\".\nLehman Brothers Investment Management Director George Herbert Walker IV dismissed the proposal, going so far as to actually apologize to other members of the Lehman Brothers executive committee for the idea of bonus reduction having been suggested. He wrote, \"Sorry team. I am not sure what's in the water at Neuberger Berman. I'm embarrassed and I apologize.\"\n\nRichard Fuld, head of Lehman Brothers, faced questioning from the U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) asked: \"Your company is now bankrupt, our economy is in crisis, but you get to keep $480 million (£276 million). I have a very basic question for you, is this fair?\" Fuld said that he had in fact taken about $300 million (£173 million) in pay and bonuses over the past eight years. Despite Fuld's defense on his high pay, Lehman Brothers executive pay was reported to have increased significantly before filing for bankruptcy. On October 17, 2008, CNBC reported that several Lehman executives, including Richard Fuld, had been subpoenaed in a case relating to securities fraud.\n\nIn March 2010, the report of Anton R. Valukas, the Bankruptcy Examiner, drew attention to the use of Repo 105 transactions to boost the bank's apparent financial position around the date of the year-end balance sheet. The New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo later filed charges against the bank's auditors Ernst & Young in December 2010, alleging that the firm \"substantially assisted... a massive accounting fraud\" by approving the accounting treatment.\n\nOn April 12, 2010, a story in \"The New York Times\" revealed that Lehman had used a small company, Hudson Castle, to move a number of transactions and assets off Lehman's books as a means of manipulating accounting numbers of Lehman's finances and risks. One Lehman executive described Hudson Castle as an \"alter ego\" of Lehman. According to the story, Lehman owned one quarter of Hudson; Hudson's board was controlled by Lehman, most Hudson staff members were former Lehman employees.\n\nOn February 22, 2011, Judge James M. Peck of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York rejected claims by lawyers for the Lehman estate that Barclays had improperly reaped a windfall from the section 363 sale. \"The sale process may have been imperfect, but it was still adequate under the exceptional circumstances of Lehman Week.\"\n\n\n"}

The festival returned in 2006 without any dispute under the direction of veteran filmmaker Lee Jang-ho and a new programming team.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "773298", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=773298", "title": "Conceptual system", "text": "Conceptual system\n\nA conceptual system is a system that is composed of non-physical objects, i.e. ideas or concepts. In this context a system is taken to mean \"an interrelated, interworking set of objects\".\n\nA conceptual system is a conceptual model. Such systems may be related to any topic from formal science to individual imagination. Conceptual systems may be found within the human mind, as works of art and fiction, and within the academic world. Indeed, this article may be understood as a conceptual system because it includes a set of interrelated concepts.\n\nBroadly, when a conceptual system includes a range of values, ideas, and beliefs the conceptual system is said be a view of the world. In psychology and social work, a conceptual system may refer to an individual's mental model of the world. In humans, a conceptual system may be understood as kind of a metaphor for the world. In science, there are many forms of conceptual systems including laws, theories, and models. Those conceptual systems may be developed through inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning, and empirical analysis.\n\nThe idea that the human mind might contain conceptual systems goes back at least as far as Kelly's personal construct theory in 1955. More recently, many scholars discuss conceptual systems and the importance of understanding them (c.f. Bateson, Luhmann, Senge, Quine, Eco, Umpleby, and Wallis). On the personal level, the human mind is generally held to contain a wide range of conceptual systems although they are not well organized. Indeed, our minds are full of conflicting mental models which makes decision making unreliable - particularly in large-scale, complex situations.\n\nWithin the academic literature, each theory may be understood as a conceptual system. Conceptual systems are generally held to have greater value when they are more useful, based on more research, and are more systemically interrelated.\n\nGenerally, that validity may also be described in terms of its internal coherence and the correspondence between the conceptual system and other systems (e.g. social systems or physical systems). Coherence may be tested by Integrative complexity (for individuals) and by Integrative Propositional Analysis (for academic theories). Correspondence is generally tested by empirical analysis and conditions of falsifiability. The conceptual system may then be said to model the physical or social system and serve as a guide for individual behavior or academic research.\n\nExamples of conceptual systems include:\n\nA concept is an abstract idea or a mental symbol, typically associated with a corresponding representation in language or symbology, that denotes all of the objects in a given category or class of entities, interactions, phenomena, or relationships between them. Concepts are abstract in that they omit the differences of the things in extension, treating them as if they were identical. They are universal in that they apply equally to everything in their extension. Concepts are also the basic elements of propositions, much the same way a word is the basic semantic element of a sentence. Unlike perceptions, which are particular images of individual objects, concepts cannot be visualized. Because they are not, themselves, individual perceptions, concepts are discursive and result from reason. They can only be thought about, or designated, by means of a name. Words are not concepts. Words are signs for concepts.\n\nA conceptual model is a representation of some phenomenon, data or theory by logical and mathematical objects such as functions, relations, tables, stochastic processes, formulas, axiom systems, rules of inference etc. A conceptual model has an ontology, that is the set of expressions in the model which are \"intended\" to denote some aspect of the modeled object. Here we are deliberately vague as to how expressions are constructed in a model and particularly what the logical structure of formulas in a model actually is. In fact, we have made no assumption that models are encoded in any formal logical system at all, although we briefly address this issue below. Moreover, the definition given here is oblivious to whether two expressions really should denote the same thing. Note that this notion of ontology is different from (and weaker than) ontology as is sometimes understood in philosophy; in our sense there is no claim that the expressions actually denote anything which exists \"physically\" or \"spatio-temporally\" (to use W. Quine's formulation).\n\nFor example, a stochastic model of stock prices includes in its ontology a sample space, random variables, the mean and variance of stock prices, various regression coefficients etc. Models of quantum mechanics in which pure states are represented as unit vectors in a Hilbert space include in their ontologies observables, dynamics, measurement operators etc. It is possible that observables and states of quantum mechanics are as physically real as the electrons they model, but by adopting this purely formal notion of ontology we avoid altogether this question.\n\nA conceptual framework is used in research to outline possible courses of action or to present a preferred approach to a system analysis project. It has also been defined as the organization of ideas to achieve a purpose The framework is built from a set of concepts linked to a planned or existing system of methods, behaviors, functions, relationships, and objects. A conceptual framework might, in computing terms, be thought of as a relational model.\n\nFor example, a conceptual framework of accounting \"seeks to identify the nature, subject, purpose and broad content of general-purpose financial reporting and the qualitative characteristics that financial information should possess\".\n\n\n"}

The date is celebrated in a manner similar to the way that Valentine's Day is celebrated on February 14 in many other parts of the world, with gifts, romantic activities, decorations and festivities. The term \"Dia dos Namorados\" is also used in other Portuguese-speaking countries.\n\nAnthony of Padua, known as Saint Anthony, died on June 13, 1231, in Padua, Italy. In addition to having been canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church, Anthony of Padua is recognized as a general in the Brazilian Army. In Brazil, the Dia dos Namorados is celebrated on June 12, which is Saint Anthony's Day Eve. Saint Anthony is recognized for blessing young couples with happy and prosperous marriages. Celebrations for Dia dos Namorados in Brazil and those for Valentine's Day in most other countries are similar. Typically, couples exchange romantic gifts, such as chocolates or flowers, and they may also share a \"date night\". Additionally, beautifying home decorations are common as a part of the celebration. The day is festive, with colorful street decorations, parades and carnivals. Common musical celebrations include samba dancing and other folk music celebrations. In 2011 and in 2012, the day was recognized online as the subject of a Google doodle.\n\nDia dos Namorados as a celebration for lovers is closely related to observances of Saint Anthony's Day. Although Saint Anthony's Day is celebrated in some countries on January 17 in association with Anthony the Great, Saint Anthony (of Padua)'s Day Eve or Saint Anthony's Day is a day of religious observance for many in Brazil and his homeland of Portugal. Single women perform popular rituals, called \"simpatias\", in order to find a good husband or boyfriend. In addition to prayer on the Eve, one might conceal a love letter in a pot of basil to pass to a prospective suitor.\n\nThe February 14 Valentine's Day is not celebrated in Brazil at all because it usually falls close to the Brazilian Carnival, which is celebrated in most other countries annually during the four days before Ash Wednesday, which falls between February 4 and March 10 depending on the year. \n\nIn other Portuguese speaking countries, mainly in Africa, Valentine's Day is referred to as \"Dia dos Namorados\" and celebrated the same day Valentine's Day is celebrated in February.\n"}

{"id": "1362431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1362431", "title": "Francis Tumblety", "text": "Francis Tumblety\n\nFrancis Tumblety (c.1833 – 28 May 1903) was an Irish-born American medical quack who earned a small fortune posing as an \"Indian Herb\" doctor throughout the United States and Canada. He was an eccentric self-promoter and was often in trouble with the law. He has been put forward as a suspect for the notorious and unsolved Jack the Ripper murder spree in Whitechapel, London, in 1888.\n\nAccording to the 1850 United States census, Tumblety was born in Ireland. His parents, James and Margaret Tumuelty (so spelled on their tombstone), along with his 10 brothers and sisters, immigrated to Rochester, New York, a few years after his birth. By the age of 17 he was selling books, which were possibly pornographic, along the Erie Canal between Rochester and Buffalo. He left home around 17, and did not return for 10 years. He was briefly employed as a cleaner at \"Lispenard's Hospital\" in Rochester.\n\nTumblety set himself up in business, initially in Detroit. He claimed to be a \"great physician\", but was commonly perceived as a quack. He sold patent medicines such as \"Tumblety's Pimple Destroyer\" and \"Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills\", and gained a reputation for his eccentric, ostentatious clothes, which were frequently of a military nature. According to Tumblety, by 1857 he was practicing medicine in Canada, before moving to New York and Washington, D.C., where he claimed to have first been introduced to Abraham Lincoln. Tumblety's medicinal approach was based on herbal remedies over mineral \"poisons\" (mercury) or surgical techniques. He was connected to the death of one of his patients in Boston, but escaped prosecution.\n\nIn 1858 he returned to Rochester apparently a rich man, making an ostentatious display of his wealth and new social standing, and claiming that it had been achieved through patenting of his medicinal cures.\n\nFederal tax records show he was in Maryland in early 1863, but he soon moved to St. Louis, Missouri, living at 50 Olive Street.\n\nOn May 5, 1865, he was arrested in St. Louis and taken to Washington on orders of the Secretary of War for alleged complicity in the Abraham Lincoln assassination, because the police believed that he was an associate of David Herold, who was captured with John Wilkes Booth. Tumblety denied any association with Herold, and there was nothing to tie him to the plot, so Tumblety was released without charge on May 30.\n\nIn 1881 he was arrested in New Orleans for pick pocketing.\n\nTumblety appeared to revel in denouncing all women, but reserved a special hatred for prostitutes; he blamed his misogyny on a failed marriage to a prostitute. In Washington, D.C., he displayed a collection of uteruses preserved in jars, which he kept in his study, to his guests at an all-male dinner party, and proudly boasted that they came from \"every class of woman\".\n\nTumblety visited Europe several times, including Ireland, Scotland, England, Germany, and France. He claimed to have been introduced to Charles Dickens and King William and to have provided treatment to Louis Napoleon, for which he was awarded the Cross of the Legion of Honor. During one visit he became closely acquainted with writer Hall Caine, with whom it has been suggested he had an affair.\n\nProfessional police officers and amateur historical researchers Stewart Evans and Paul Gainey, detailed evidence in their 1996 book \"Jack the Ripper: First American Serial Killer\" that Tumblety was temporarily resident in a boarding house in the Whitechapel district during the brief period of the murder rampage of \"Jack the Ripper\", and pieced together a case that he may be the culprit.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police arrested Tumblety on 7 November 1888 on unrelated charges of gross indecency, apparently for having been caught engaging in a homosexual encounter, which was illegal at the time. Whilst awaiting trial on this charge on bail of £300 (equivalent to £ today), and knowing that Scotland Yard was increasingly interested in him with regard to the recent murder spree in Whitechapel, he fled England for France on 20 November under the false name of \"Frank Townsend\", and on 24 November 1888 he returned to the United States. Already notorious in the United States for his self-promotion and previous brushes with the law, Tumblety's arrest in London was reported in \"The New York Times\" as being connected to the Ripper murders. American newspaper reports that Scotland Yard tried to extradite him have not been confirmed by research in the contemporary British press or the London police files. However, English police inspector Walter Andrews travelled to America, perhaps partly to trace Tumblety. The New York City Police, who had him under surveillance, said \"there is no proof of his complicity in the Whitechapel murders, and the crime for which he is under bond in London is not extraditable\". Tumblety published a self-aggrandising pamphlet titled \"Dr. Francis Tumblety – Sketch of the Life of the Gifted, Eccentric and World Famed Physician\", in which he attacked the rumours in the press but omitted any mention of his criminal charges and arrest.\n\nTumblety was mentioned as a Ripper suspect by former Detective Chief Inspector John Littlechild of the Metropolitan Police in a letter to journalist and author George R. Sims, dated 23 September 1913, which was discovered by Evans and Gainey for sale in an antiquarian bookshop in Richmond-upon-Thames. Littlechild suspected Tumblety because of his extreme misogyny and his previous criminal record.\n\nOther Ripperologists have dismissed Tumblety as a plausible Ripper suspect, citing the fact that his appearance and age did not match the description of any of the men that were seen with the murder victims, and that his relatively tall height of at least and enormous moustache would have made him particularly conspicuous. However, a contemporary interview describes Tumblety as having a much smaller moustache at the time of the Whitechapel murders than is seen in the well known photograph of him.\n\nTumblety returned to Rochester and moved in with an elderly female relative, whose house also served as his office. He was living in Baltimore, Maryland, during the 1900 census, but returned to St Louis, where he died in 1903 of heart disease. His body was buried in the family plot in Rochester's Holy Sepulchre Cemetery.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5666989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5666989", "title": "Hilaria", "text": "Hilaria\n\nThe Hilaria (; Latin \"the cheerful ones\", a term derived from the borrowed adjective \"cheerful, merry\") were ancient Roman religious festivals celebrated on the March equinox to honor Cybele.\n\nThe term seems originally to have been a name which was given to any day or season of rejoicing. The \"hilaria\" were, therefore, according to Maximus the Confessor either private or public. Among the former, he thinks it the day on which a person married, and on which a son was born; among the latter, those days of public rejoicings appointed by a new emperor. Such days were devoted to general rejoicings and public sacrifices, and no one was allowed to show any symptoms of grief or sorrow.\n\nThe Romans also celebrated \"hilaria\" as a \"feria stativa\", on March 25, the eighth day before the Calends of April, in honor of Cybele, the mother of the gods; and it is probably to distinguish these \"hilaria\" from those mentioned above, that the \"Augustan History\" calls them Hilaria Matris Deûm. The day of its celebration was the first after the vernal equinox, or the first day of the year which was longer than the night. The winter with its gloom had died, and the first day of a better season was spent in rejoicings. The manner of its celebration during the time of the republic is unknown, except that Valerius Maximus mentions games in honour of the mother of the gods. Respecting its celebration at the time of the empire, Herodian writes that, among other things, there was a solemn procession, in which the statue of the goddess was carried, and before this statue were carried the most costly specimens of plate and works of art belonging either to wealthy Romans or to the emperors themselves. All kinds of games and amusements were allowed on this day; masquerades were the most prominent among them, and everyone might, in his disguise, imitate whomsoever he liked, and even magistrates.\n\nThe Romans took this feast originally from the Greeks, who called it , Latin \"Ascensus\": the eve of that day they spent in tears and lamentations, calling it \"Κατάβασις\" (Latin \"Dēscensus\"). Greek writers later borrowed the Latin name as Ἱλάρια, as appears from Photios I of Constantinople's \"Bibliotheca\" in his codex of the life of the philosopher Isidore of Alexandria.\n\nThe full festival can be tentatively reconstructed (with the days of the festival literally translated) as follows:\n\n\nAccording to the Calendar of Filocalus from 354, a Hilaria of Isis was part of the Isia festival, taking place on its final day, November 3.\n\nHerodian details an assassination plot by Maternus against Emperor Commodus that was to occur on the hilaria. Maternus planned to disguise himself and his followers as members of the Praetorian Guard, and proceed among the true members of the Guard, until they were close enough to kill Commodus. However, one of Maternus's followers revealed the plot ahead of time, betraying him because, according to Herodian, his men \"preferred a legitimate emperor to a robber tyrant\". On the day of hilaria, he was beheaded and his followers punished. The public celebrated the emperor's safety, and Commodus sacrificed to Cybele for protecting him from harm. \n\n"}

Widespread early news coverage said that the protests were a spontaneous response to an online preview of \"Innocence of Muslims,\" a movie considered offensive to Muslims. Later consideration of the Libya attack's complexity, of statements made by some Libyan officials, and of the potentially symbolic date (the anniversary of the September 11 attacks) fueled speculation of preplanned efforts. U.S. missions in Cairo, Egypt, and Benghazi, Libya, were attacked during the first day of the protest.\n\nEgyptian Prime Minister Hisham Kandil condemned violence, saying: \"What happened at the U.S. embassy in Cairo is regrettable and [is] rejected by all Egyptian people and cannot be justified, especially if we consider that the people that produced this low film have no relation to the U.S. government. We ask the American government to take a firm position towards this film's producers within the framework of international charters that criminalise acts that stir strife on the basis of race, color or religion.\" Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi issued a statement 24 hours after the event, saying: \"The presidency deplores the most vicious attempt to insult the person of Muhammad and condemns people who produced this extremist film\" and asked President Obama to \"act against the film\". It added that the President had instructed Egyptian Embassy in the U.S. to \"take possible legal action to respond to those persons who seek to sabotage the relations and dialogue between peoples and nations.\"\n\nThe site Onislam, which is affiliated with Al Azhar, issued a fatwa condemning the violence. Al Azhar itself issued a fatwa condemning the violence.\n\nThe initial reactions of President Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood were received coldly in the US. Both American media, policy experts and President Obama contrasted the allegedly insufficient and \"mild\" Egyptian reaction with the Libyan reaction, which they praised. Martin S. Indyk, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, criticized the \"precious little\" that Egyptian police did \"the fourth time an embassy was assaulted in Cairo,\" while others criticized that the Morsi's 24-hour wait before his allegedly \"mild\" initial rebuke of the embassy attack, which allegedly seemed to focus more on condemnation of film. In an interview, Obama remarked that though Egypt was not hostile, it was not \"necessarily an ally,\" though the administration later backed off from this statement. In a late-night phone call, Obama warned Morsi that relations could be jeopardized if Egypt failed to protect diplomats. Two days after, a particular Arabic release by the Brotherhood saying \"Egyptians rise up to support Muhammad in front of the American Embassy. Sept. 11,\" was attacked by the U.S. embassy in a statement.\n\nResponding to this criticism, both Morsi and the Brotherhood took a much harder line against the embassy attacks, promising charges against those who scaled the embassy's walls, offering condolences for Stevens' death, and appearing on Egyptian television, telling Egyptians of their \"religious duty to protect our guests and those who come to us from outside our nation ... I know that the people attacking the embassies do not represent any of us.\" Meanwhile, one Muslim Brotherhood spokesman defended its rhetoric, saying they balanced anger at the film with urging restraint, while its strategist, Khairat el-Shater wrote a letter to the NY Times, explaining that \"Despite our resentment of the continued appearance of productions like the anti-Muslim film that led to the current violence, we do not hold the American government or its citizens responsible for acts of the few that abuse the laws protecting freedom of expression.\"\n\nLibyan Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur's office condemned the attack and extended condolences, saying: \"While strongly condemning any attempt to abuse the person of Muhammad, or an insult to our holy places and prejudice against the faith, we reject and strongly condemn the use of force to terrorise innocent people and the killing of innocent people.\" It also reaffirmed \"the depth of relationship between the peoples of Libya and the U.S., which grew closer with the positions taken by the U.S. government in support of the revolution of February 17.\" Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf, the President of the General National Congress of Libya, said: \"We apologise to the United States, the people and to the whole world for what happened. We confirm that no-one will escape from punishment and questioning.\" He also said \"we expect the world to cooperate with us to confront to what is meant out of this kind of act of cowardice.\"\n\nLibyans held demonstrations in Benghazi and Tripoli on September 12, condemning the violence and holding signs such as, \"Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans\", and apologizing to Americans for the actions in their name and in the name of Muslims. The \"New York Times\" noted that young Libyans had also flooded Twitter with pro-American messages after the attacks.\n\nIt has been noted that Libyans are typically more positively inclined towards the US than their neighbors. A 2012 Gallup poll noted that \"A majority of Libyans (54%) surveyed in March and April 2012 approve of the leadership of the U.S. -- among the highest approval Gallup has ever recorded in the ... region, outside of Israel.\" Another poll in Eastern Libya, taken in 2011, reported that the population was at the same time both deeply religious conservative Muslims and very pro-American, with 90% of respondents reporting favorable views of the US.\n\nAli Aujali, the ambassador to the U.S., praised Stevens as a \"dear friend\" and a \"real hero\" at a reception in Washington alongside Hillary Clinton. He also urged the U.S. to continue supporting Libya this \"very difficult time\" and that the young Libyan government needed help so that it could \"maintain ... security and stability in our country.\" The Libyan response to the crisis was praised and appreciated in the U.S., with U.S. President Barack Obama emphasising how the Libyans \"helped our diplomats to safety\" the following day. A \"New York Times\" editorial criticised Egypt's government for not doing \"what Libyan leaders did.\"\n\nThe Islamic institution of Dar al-Ifta' al-Libiyya, headed by Libya's Grand Mufti Al-Sadiq al-Ghiryani, issued a statemtement strongly condemning the attacks on the US diplomats and Libyan forces, citing a hadith by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, \"Whoever killed a \"Mu'ahid\" (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of forty years (of traveling)\".\n\nYemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Al-Hadi reacted to the attack in Sana'a and extended his apologies to the U.S., according to a statement released by the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, D.C. The statement added that the President instructed officials to \"conduct an expeditious and thorough investigation into today's events\" and confirmed that the perpetrators \"will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\"\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama said that he \"strongly condemned this outrageous attack\" on U.S. diplomatic facilities. He further ordered that security be increased at all such facilities. Obama stated with respect to the death of four diplomats in Benghazi: \"Today we mourn four more Americans who represent the very best of the United States of America. We will not waver in our commitment to see that justice is done for this terrible act. And make no mistake, justice will be done.\" A Marine FAST team was sent to Libya to help with security.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said: \"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. But let me be clear: There is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\" She also said: \"America's commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear, there is no justification for this -- none. Violence like this is no way to honor a religion or faith and as long as there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.\"\nMinnesota Democrat Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, condemned both the film and the protests. He stated that the \"amateurish and stupid\" film was \"deeply offensive\" to \"anyone who respects the faith of others\", while at the same time emphasising that \"the United States government had no role in creating this film. In fact, the government has condemned it and the American people have rejected it; it violates the American value of religious tolerance. Responding with violence is never justified. And those who think they are doing so in the name of Islam are wrong and ill informed.\" U.S. Congressmen, including Rand Paul, Tom McClintock, and Jeff Landry, asked that aid to Egypt and Libya be halted or cut. U.S. Senators John McCain, Lindsey Graham and Joe Lieberman stated: \"[W]e cannot give in to the temptation to believe that our support for the democratic aspirations of people in Libya, Egypt, and elsewhere in the broader Middle East is naive or mistaken. We cannot resign ourselves to the false belief that the Arab Spring is doomed to be defined not by the desire for democracy and freedom that has inspired millions of people to peaceful action, but by the dark fanaticism of terrorists.\" If Americans would do this, it \"would not only be a victory for the extremists and their associates, but a betrayal of everything for which Chris Stevens and his colleagues stood and gave their lives.\"\n\nThe Obama administration opened an investigation into whether the attack in Libya was a planned terrorist attack on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, because it was \"too coordinated or professional to be spontaneous\", rather than a spontaneous mob that was angry over a YouTube video criticising Islam. According to \"The New York Times\" and CNN, officials within the Obama administration have said that they believe the attack in Benghazi was deliberate, and reports indicate one or more pro-al Qaeda groups may have been involved in the attack.\n\nThe United States Navy dispatched two \"Arleigh Burke\" class destroyers, the USS \"McFaul\" and the USS \"Laboon\", to the Libyan coast. The destroyers are equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles. American unmanned aerial vehicles were also sent to fly over Libya to search for the perpetrators of the attack. The Pentagon announced it had sent FAST Marines to Yemen to bolster U.S. embassy security there after the attack.\n\nAt 6:17 EST in the United States, 11 September - The embassy in Cairo released a statement:\n\nThe Embassy of the United States in Cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims – as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions. Today, the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, Americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy. Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy. We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of other.\n\nAt about 12:00 EST, protesters outside the Cairo embassy breach the wall and tear down U.S. flag. At about 16:00, the embassy posted a message on \"Twitter\" that read: \"1) Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. 2) Of course we condemn breaches of our compound, we're the ones actually living through this. 3) Sorry, but neither breaches of our compound or angry messages will dissuade us from defending freedom of speech AND criticizing bigotry\"\n\nLater in the day, Romney issued a statement saying: \"It is disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks\". Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus also released a statement that read: \"Obama sympathizes with attackers in Egypt. Sad and pathetic\"\n\nThe next day, Romney reiterated the statements: \"I also believe the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with a those who had breached our Embassy in Egypt instead of condemning their actions. The embassy in Cairo put out a statement after their grounds had been breached, protesters were inside the grounds. They reiterated that statement after the breach. I think it's a -- a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values. ... It's their administration. Their administration spoke. The president takes responsibility not just for the words that come from his mouth but also from the words of his ambassadors, from his administration, from his embassies, from his State Department. They clearly sent mixed messages to the world. The statement that came from the administration -- and the embassy is the administration -- the statement that came from the administration was a statement which is akin to apology. And I think was a severe miscalculation.\" Paul Ryan echoed Romney's criticism, saying: \"The administration sent mixed signals to those who attacked our embassy in Egypt and mixed signals to the world.\"\n\nWhen directly asked about Romney's statements, Obama told 60 Minutes that Romney \"seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later.\" Obama said that Romney \"didn't have his facts right\".\n\nThe editorial board of the \"Denver Post\" noted that Romney's critique of the embassy's statement was \"out [of] line,\" but also stated: \"This country cannot allow extremists anywhere to dictate what Americans speak, write, draw or film ... Sorry, provocative speech is not an abuse of free speech. It is precisely the speech the First Amendment exists to protect.\"\n\nThe Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) condemned the attack. Imam Mohamed Magid, the president of the Islamic Society of North America, an umbrella organisation of regional Muslims, condemned the violence at a news conference standing alongside a Baptist minister, a rabbi, and Ali Aujali, the Libyan ambassador to the U.S. He said: \"Those who did this act of violence fall into the trap of the people who want them to act that way.\" Salam al-Marayati, president of the Los Angeles-based Muslim Public Affairs Council, said in a published statement that \"America is our home and is home to Islam, like so many other religions. Anyone who attempts to promote the misconception that Muslims are not integrated into America is fomenting more fear and destructive behavior.\"\n\nIsobel Coleman has observed that one reason for why U.S. government institutions were attacked was \"a widespread problem across the Arab world: People who have lived their lives largely under dictatorship simply cannot understand how a film can be made without government sanction.\" Law professor Jack Balkin elaborated upon this point in an interview with \"The Atlantic\": \"Some Egyptians and Libyans think that any products of the U.S. media that make it to their countries have at least tacit U.S. government approval. A very small part of this sad mess may be a cultural translation problem.\" Newt Gingrich claims September 12 that the Egypt and the Libya attacks are connected. The same day, Marco Rubio speaks of \"mob\" attacks.\n\n – GCC Secretary-General Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani released a statement that said: \"This film cannot be accepted or excused as it abuses the feelings of Muslims and non-Muslims who reject insulting prophets, religions and beliefs.\" The secretary-general also \"condemned acts of violence against US embassies in some countries,\" adding that \"our anger ... is no excuse to such carry out such attacks that only serve the low and suspicious aims of those who produced it.\"\n\n – Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci offered his condolences to Hillary Clinton over the death of Ambassador Stevens. The foreign ministry also sharply criticised the movie \"Innocence of Muslims\".\n\n – With respect to a film mocking the Prophet Mohammed The office of President Hamid Karzai issued a statement in which it \"strongly and resolutely denounces this desecrating act and declares its serious abhorrence in the face of such an insult. Prophet Mohammed ... was the greatest prophet of Islam, a prophet sent to guide mankind, a pacifist and a promoter of truth and honesty in the universe. In fact, insult to the greatest Prophet of Islam means insult to high values of 1.5 billion Muslims across the world. This offensive act has stoked interfaith enmity and confrontation and badly impacted the peaceful coexistence between human beings.\"\n\n – President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner said that she and the Argentine people condemned the attacks, and she deeply regrets the death of Ambassador Stevens.\n\n – Foreign Minister Bob Carr condemned the \"barbaric attack\" on the United States consulate in Libya. He also called Ambassador Stevens a \"friend to Australia\" and noted that \"Libya is a country finding its way out of the wreckage of decades of dictatorship, and struggling with the challenges of rogue militia and Gaddafi sympathisers.\"\n\n – Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger was \"deeply shocked\" and condemned \"in the strongest terms the murder of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other consulate employees in Bengazhi [sic].\" He added that \"the new Libya ... must draw a clear line here.\"\n\nThe Moro Islamic Liberation Front, an Islamist group in the southern Philippines denied Al-Qaeda calls to attack US targets over the controversial film and have urged Filipino Muslims not to resort to violence. The group is currently in ceasefire with the Philippine government and has vowed not to attack American targets in the country. \"We do not live in the dark ages, there are rules and laws that need to be followed,\" MILF's chief political officer Ghazali Jaafar said. He described the incident in Benghazi as a \"senseless act of violence.\" He also said that the protection of diplomats and embassies must be honored even in war, and condemned the people behind the anti-Muslim film.\n\nThe video has been blocked in Egypt and Libya by YouTube. Indonesia has also blocked the video, while Afghanistan has blocked YouTube itself. It was reported that India is also planning to block the video and other similar pages.\n\n"}

{"id": "24133330", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24133330", "title": "Kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard", "text": "Kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard\n\nThe kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard occurred on June 10, 1991, south of South Lake Tahoe, California. Dugard, 11 years old, was abducted from a street while walking from home to a school bus stop. Searches began immediately after her disappearance, but no reliable leads were generated despite the fact that her stepfather, Carl Probyn, witnessed her kidnapping and chased the kidnappers on his mountain bike. Dugard remained missing until 2009, when a convicted sex offender, Phillip Garrido, visited the University of California, Berkeley campus in Berkeley accompanied by two girls on August 24 and 25 that year. The unusual behavior of the trio sparked an investigation that led Garrido's parole officer to order him to take the two girls to a parole office in Concord, California, on August 26. He was accompanied by a woman identified as Jaycee Dugard, 29 years old.\n\nPhillip, 58, and his wife, Nancy Garrido, 54, of Antioch, were arrested by police for kidnapping, imprisonment, and sexual assault. On April 28, 2011, they pleaded guilty to Dugard's kidnapping and sexual assault. Law enforcement officers believe Dugard was kept in concealed tents, sheds, and lean-tos in an area behind the Garridos' house in Antioch for 18 years. During such time, Dugard bore two daughters, 11 and 15 at the time of her reappearance. On June 2, 2011, Garrido was sentenced to 431 years to life imprisonment; his wife, Nancy, received 36 years to life. Garrido is a person of interest in at least one other San Francisco Bay Area missing person case.\n\nIn 1979, Dugard's biological father Ken Slayton had an affair with Dugard's mother, Terry, that resulted in a pregnancy of which he was unaware; he had never met Dugard. Upon her resurfacing, Slayton sought a relationship with Dugard, but Dugard declined this. In 2010, the State of California awarded the Dugard family . In 2011, Dugard wrote an autobiography titled \"A Stolen Life\". Her second book, \"Freedom: My Book of Firsts\", was published in 2016. According to interviews, she remains single, focusing on herself, her children, and her family. Her exact location has not been told to the public.\n\nThe primary arrestee in the case, Phillip Greg Garrido, was born in Pittsburg, California, on April 5, 1951. He grew up in Brentwood, where he graduated from Liberty High School in 1969. In 1972, Garrido was arrested and charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, but the case did not go to trial after the girl declined to testify.\n\nIn 1973, Garrido married high school classmate Christine Murphy, who said he was abusive. Murphy alleged that Garrido kidnapped her when she tried to leave him.\n\nIn 1976, Garrido kidnapped 25-year-old Katherine Callaway in South Lake Tahoe, California. He took her to a Reno, Nevada warehouse, where he raped her for five and a half hours. When a police officer noticed a car parked outside the unit and then the broken lock on the warehouse door, he knocked on the door and was greeted by Garrido. Callaway then emerged and asked for help. Garrido was promptly arrested. He was charged and convicted of crimes in both federal and state courts. In a 1976 court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, Garrido was diagnosed as a \"sexual deviant and chronic drug abuser.\" The psychiatrist recommended that a neurological examination be conducted because Garrido's chronic drug use could be \"responsible in part\" for his \"mixed\" or \"multiple\" sexual deviation. He was then evaluated by a neurologist. The diagnostic impression was: \"normal neurological examination.\" In court, Garrido testified that he masturbated in his car by the side of elementary and high schools while watching girls. He was convicted on March 9, 1977 and began serving a 50-year federal sentence on June 30, 1977, at Leavenworth Penitentiary in Kansas.\n\nAt Leavenworth, Garrido met Nancy Bocanegrathe secondary arrestee in Dugard's kidnapping who was visiting another prisoner, her uncle. On October 5, 1981, he and Bocanegra were married at Leavenworth. On January 22, 1988, Garrido was released from Leavenworth to Nevada State Prison, where he served seven months of a five-years-to-life Nevada sentence. He was transferred to federal parole authorities in Contra Costa on August 26, 1988. In Antioch, the Garridos lived in the home of his elderly mother, who suffered from dementia. As a parolee, he was monitored, later wore a GPS-enabled ankle bracelet, and was visited many times by parole officers, local sheriff's deputies, and federal agents.\n\nIn 2009, his father, Manuel Garrido, who resided in Brentwood, said his son was a \"good boy\" as a child but changed radically after a serious motorcycle accident as a teenager. Garrido later turned to drug useprimarily crystal meth and LSD. Garrido's brother Ron (born 1944) who lives in Brentwood said Garrido became a \"fruitcake\" after getting hooked on hallucinogenic and stimulant street drugs. Manuel died in Brentwood in 2011 at the age of 90.\n\nIn September 1990, Dugard and her family moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because they thought it was a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was worrying about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted in and out of consciousness during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.\n\nCarl Probyn witnessed the abduction of his stepdaughter from within sight of their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, but was unable to overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to the abduction. Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard expressed no interest at the time in having a relationship with Slayton. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.\n\nBy the time the Garridos arrived at their home in an unincorporated area in Contra Costa County, they had removed Dugard's clothing, leaving only a butterfly-shaped ring that she hid from them for the next 18 years. Taking her from their car onto their property, Garrido placed a blanket over Dugard's head and ushered her into an area of his backyard where sheds and storage units stood, placing her inside a tiny one that was soundproofed. After he finished raping her for the first time he left her naked in the structure, which he bolted shut, warning her that Doberman Pinschers were outside and trained to attack her if she tried to escape. Garrido would visit her in the structure, bringing her food and milkshakes, and talking to her.\n\nWithin hours of Dugard's disappearance, local and national media converged on South Lake Tahoe to cover the story. Within days, dozens of local volunteers assisted in the search effort, which involved nearly every resource within the community. Within weeks, tens of thousands of fliers and posters were mailed to businesses throughout the United States. Since her favorite color was pink, the town was blanketed in pink ribbons as a constant reminder of her disappearance, and as a demonstration of support for her family by the community.\n\nTerry Probyn founded a group called Jaycee's Hope, which directed the volunteer and fundraising efforts. Cassette tapes of the song \"Jaycee Lee\" along with T-shirts, sweatshirts, and buttons were sold to raise money for poster materials, postage, printing, and related expenses. Child Quest International and the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children were involved in the effort. A reward was offered, which was noted on the posters and fliers. The kidnapping case attracted nationwide attention and was featured on the June 14, 1991 episode of the television show \"America's Most Wanted\".\n\nThe ensuing months and years were a continuous effort of child safety awareness, fundraising events, and candlelight vigils marking Dugard's disappearance keeping her story before the public.\n\nImmediately after he kidnapped her, Garrido forced Dugard into a shower with him. The first time he raped her, she was still in handcuffs, which she wore during her first week in captivity. During that period, Dugard's only human contact was Garrido, who sometimes brought her fast food and told her amusing stories. He provided a bucket for her to use to relieve herself. At one point, he provided her with a television, but she could not watch the news and was unaware of the publicized search for her. Almost a month and a half after her kidnapping, by Dugard's recollection, Garrido moved her to a larger room next door, where she was handcuffed to a bed. He explained that the \"demon angels\" let him take her and that she would help him with his sexual problems because society had ignored him. He went on methamphetamine binges he called \"runs\", during which he would dress Dugard up and spend time with her while cutting out figures from pornographic magazines. He made her listen for the voices he said he could hear from the walls. Garrido also often professed the belief that he was a chosen servant of God. These binges would end with him sobbing and apologizing to Dugard alternating with threats to sell her to people who would put her in a cage.\n\nSeven months into her captivity, Garrido introduced Dugard to his wife, Nancy, who brought the child a stuffed animal and chocolate milk, and engaged in the same tearful apologies to her. Though Dugard craved the woman's approval at the time, in retrospect she has stated that she was manipulated by Nancy, who alternated between motherly concern and coldness and cruelty, expressing her jealousy of Dugard, whom she regarded as the one to blame for her predicament. Dugard characterized Nancy, who worked as a nursing home aide, as \"evil\" and \"twisted.\" When Garrido was returned to prison for failing a drug test, Nancy replaced her husband as Dugard's jailer. The Garridos manipulated Dugard further by presenting her, on two occasions, with kittens that would later \"mysteriously vanish.\" When they discovered that she was signing her real name in a journal that she kept on the kittens, she was forced to tear out the page with her name on it, the last time she would be permitted to say or write her name until years later. She was never allowed to see a doctor or dentist.\n\nThirty-four months into her captivity, the Garridos began to allow Dugard freedom from her handcuffs for periods of time, though they kept her locked in the bolted room. On April 3, 1994, Easter Sunday, they gave her cooked food for the first time. They informed her that they believed that she was pregnant. Age 13 and four-and-a-half months pregnant, Dugard had learned of the link between sex and pregnancy from television. At this time, while Dugard was raising her baby, Angel, Terry Probyn was holding rummage sales to pay for private investigators and distributing a million flyers across the United States featuring a sketch artist's image of a teenage Dugard. Dugard watched programs on childbirth, in preparation for the birth of her first daughter, which occurred on August 18, 1994. Her second daughter was born on November 13, 1997. Dugard took care of her daughters using information learned from television, working to protect them from Garrido, who continued his enraged rants and lectures.\n\nNeighbor Patrick McQuaid said that he recalls, as a child, meeting Dugard through a fence in the Garridos' yard soon after the kidnapping. He said that she had identified herself by the name \"Jaycee\" and that when he asked her if she lived there or was just visiting, she answered that she lived there. At that point, Garrido came out and took her back indoors. He eventually built an eight-foot-tall fence around the backyard and set up a tent for Dugard, the first time that she was allowed to walk outside since her kidnapping. She coped with her continued captivity by planting flowers in a garden and home-schooling her daughters. At one point, Garrido informed Dugard that to pacify his wife, she and her daughters were to address Nancy as their mother, and that she was to teach her daughters that she was their older sister. When Dugard and her daughters were eventually allowed to come into contact with other people, they continued this fiction.\n\nGarrido operated a print shop where Dugard acted as the graphic artist. Ben Daughdrill, a customer of Garrido's printing business, claimed that he met and spoke by telephone with Dugard and that she did excellent work. During this time, Dugard had access to the business phone and an email account. Another customer indicated that she never hinted to him about her childhood abduction or her true identity.\n\nGarrido kept a blog associated with what he called \"God's Desire Church.\" In the blog, he claimed that he had the power to control sound with his mind. Garrido asked several people, including customers, to sign testimonials confirming that they witnessed his ability to \"control sound with my mind\" and a device he developed \"for others to witness this .\"\n\nLaw enforcement officers believe that in 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what has been described as a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law enforcement officers visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the front door to talk to people, but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.\n\n\nOn August 24, 2009, Garrido visited the San Francisco office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and left a four-page essay containing his ideas about religion and sexuality, suggesting that he had discovered a solution to problem behaviors like his past crimes. The essay described how he had cured his criminal sexual behaviors and how that information could be used to assist in curing other sexual predators by: \"controlling human impulses that drive humans to commit dysfunctional acts.\" On the same day, he went to a University of California, Berkeley police office with Dugard's two daughters, seeking permission to hold a special event on campus as a part of his \"God's Desire\" program. He spoke with U.C. Berkeley special events manager Lisa Campbell. She perceived his behavior as \"erratic\" and that the girls were \"sullen and submissive.\" She asked him to make an appointment for the next day, which he did, leaving his name in the process. Officer Ally Jacobs discovered, through a background check, that Garrido was a registered sex offender on federal parole for kidnapping and rape. When he and the girls returned for their appointment at 2:00p.m. the following day, August 25, Jacobs made a point of sitting in during the meeting. The girls appeared to Jacobs to be pale, as if having not been exposed to sunlight, and their behavior unusual. Since Garrido's several parole violations were a basis for an arrest, Jacobs phoned the parole office to relay her concerns, leaving a report of the meeting on voicemail.\n\nAfter hearing Jacobs' recorded message, two parole agents drove to the Garridos' house later that day. Upon arrival, they handcuffed him and searched the house, finding only his wife Nancy and his elderly mother at home. Then the parole agents drove him back to the parole office. En route, he said that the girls who had accompanied him to UC Berkeley \"were the daughters of a relative, and he had permission from their parents to take them to the university.\" Although a month before the parole office had barred Garrido from being around minors, and although Berkeley was from the Garridos' Contra Costa residence, in excess of the limit he was allowed to travel from his home without permission from his parole agent, the agents overlooked this violation. After reviewing his file with a supervisor, they drove him home and ordered him to report to the office again the next day to discuss further his visit to UC Berkeley, and to follow up on their concerns about the two girls.\n\nGarrido arrived at the parole office in Concord, California on August 26 with his wife Nancy, the two girls, and Dugard, who was introduced as \"Allissa\". The parole officer decided to separate Garrido from the women and girls to obtain their identification.\n\nMaintaining her false identity as \"Allissa\", Dugard told investigators that the girls were her daughters. Although she indicated that she was aware that Garrido was a convicted sex offender, she stated that he was a \"changed man\", a \"great person\" and was \"good with her kids\", comments that were echoed by the two girls. When pressed for details that would confirm her identity, Dugard became \"extremely defensive\" and \"agitated\",\ndemanding to know why she was being \"interrogated\", and subsequently stated that she was a battered wife from Minnesota in hiding from her abusive husband. The parole officer eventually called the Concord police. Upon the arrival of a police sergeant, Garrido admitted he had kidnapped and raped her. Only after this did Dugard identify herself as Jaycee Dugard. It was later suggested that Dugard was beginning to show signs of Stockholm syndrome. In a 2016 interview with Diane Sawyer of ABC News, Dugard stated that her compassion and willingness to interact with her captor were only means of surviving. Dugard: \"The phrase [Stockholm Syndrome] implies that hostages cracked by terror and abuse become affectionate towards their captors.\" \"Well it's, really, it's degrading, you know, having my family believe that I was in love with this captor and wanted to stay with him. I mean, that is so far from the truth that it makes me want to throw up. ... I adapted to survive my circumstance.\" said Dugard. Repeatedly during this segment of the interview she states that, as a way to survive, and hoping to end abuse, many victims are forced to sympathize with their captors.\n\nGarrido and his wife were placed under arrest. An FBI Special Agent put Dugard on the telephone with her mother, Terry Probyn. Dugard retained custody of her children and was soon reunited with her mother.\n\nDugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, and a former business associate of the Garridos, Cheyvonne Molino, have commented that Dugard's children looked healthy. Tina Dugard said that upon her meeting them after their escape, they \"always appeared and behaved like normal kids\". Molino said of the times that she met them while they were captive \"that in her presence the girls never acted robotically\" and didn't wear unusual clothing.\n\nIn the days following Dugard's return, Carl Probyn, her stepfather, confirmed that Dugard and her daughters were in good health and intelligent; their reunion was going well; and they were proceeding slowly. He said his stepdaughter had developed a significant emotional bond with Garrido, and the two daughters cried when they learned of their father's arrest. Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, said Dugard's daughters are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Dugard's reappearance is an important event for families of other long-term missing children, because it shows that there is hope even in long-term cases. Notable abduction survivor Elizabeth Smart has stressed the importance of focusing on the future with a positive attitude as an effective approach to accepting what has happened. Shawn Hornbeck, another abduction survivor, also commented on the case, noting: \"Coming out of what she's had to endure is like entering a new world. It's like a door has opened for her and she's emerged from a world that's black and white into one that's full of color.\" He opined that she was brainwashed, would feel angry and now needs to move on with her life.\n\nThree weeks after her release, Dugard asked for the pets that were raised in the home. On October 14, 2009, \"People\" published the first verified photo of Jaycee Dugard as an adult on its cover. Dugard's memoir, \"A Stolen Life: A Memoir\", was published on July 12, 2011, by Simon & Schuster. Later, to regain trust with people, she would begin animal therapy by riding or petting horses with her mother Terry and her sister Shayna.\n\nFollowing the arrest, police searched the Garrido house extensively for evidence of other crimes. Because Garrido had access to his neighbor's house, it was also searched for evidence. Police also searched the homes and business of one of Garrido's printing business clients. Police agencies from Hayward and Dublin, California, conducted searches of the Garridos' property for evidence pertaining to missing girls from those communities but turned up no clues. In July 2011, Hayward police announced that Garrido has not been eliminated as a suspect and is still a person of interest in the abduction case of Michaela Garecht. Garecht was kidnapped in 1988 and Hayward is from the Garridos' Antioch home.\n\nOn August 27, 2009, KCRA-TV in Sacramento, California interviewed Garrido in his jail cell by telephone. During the interview, Garrido said, \"In the end, this is going to be a powerful, heartwarming story\" because, in his version of events:\n\nGarrido repeatedly told the reporter how he \"filed documents\" with the FBI on August 24, 2009, which, when they were published, would cause people to \"fall over backwards\", and that he could not reveal more because he \"had to protect law enforcement\", and \"what happened\" ... was \"something that humans have not understood well\". In the interview, Garrido denied he had ever harmed Dugard's two daughters. He said their births changed his life and: \"they slept in my arms every single night since birth. I never touched them.\" On August 28, 2009, FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler confirmed that Garrido had indeed left the documents with the agency, as he had claimed, but declined to discuss further details. The document, titled \"Origin of Schizophrenia Revealed\", was eventually released by the FBI. It is about stopping schizophrenics from turning violent and controlling sounds with the human mind.\n\nOn August 28, 2009, Garrido and his wife pleaded not guilty to charges including kidnapping, rape, and false imprisonment. The case was prosecuted in El Dorado County, by elected District Attorney Vern R. Pierson and Assistant District Attorney James A Clinchard. A bail review/pre-preliminary hearing was held September 14, 2009, at the El Dorado County Superior Court in Placerville, California. At the hearing, Superior Court Judge Douglas Phimister set bail for Garrido's wife Nancy at . However, there was a no-bail parole hold on Garrido. The judge kept Nancy in custody on a no-bail hold but able to request bail at a later date. At the September 14 hearing, Phimister also granted a request from Garrido's attorney to have a psychologist or psychiatrist appointed to conduct a confidential evaluation. Such examinations can be used by the defense to assist in case preparation, and additional mental health examinations can be ordered at subsequent phases in the proceedings. On October 29, 2009, a short hearing was held to set a date for the next pre-preliminary hearing when issues such as discovery were to be discussed. This hearing occurred on December 11, 2009. Katie Callaway Hall, whom Garrido kidnapped and raped in 1976, appeared in the courtroom at the October and December hearings. She did not speak during either proceeding.\n\nOn November 5, 2009, Phimister ordered Nancy's defense attorney, Gilbert Maines, to be removed from the case. According to a posting on the court's website, the decision occurred in review of \"confidential evidence\" that has not been disclosed to the public, and details of the proceedings were kept sealed. The decision was immediately stayed until November 30, 2009. On November 12, 2009, Phimister appointed Stephen A. Tapson as interim counsel for Nancy. Gilbert Maines appealed the decision and received a favorable ruling by the California Third District Court of Appeal on December 15, 2009. On December 22, 2009, the same court gave the Eldorado Superior Court until January 2010 to respond to the ruling. Both Gilbert Maines and Stephen Tapson appeared at the discovery hearing on December 11, 2009. A hearing was held on January 21, 2010. At that hearing, Maines was removed from the case and Tapson was appointed defense counsel for Nancy. In addition, bail, in the amount of , was set for Nancy.\n\nAt a press conference on February 28, 2011, Tapson said that Nancy and Phillip Garrido had both made a 'full confession' in the case. The development came as lawyers for both sides re-opened discussions on a possible plea deal that had the potential to obviate the need for a trial. Nancy's attorney acknowledged that she was facing \"241 years, eight months to life\" and that he was working for a reduced sentence in the 30-year range. He stated that the prosecutor had acknowledged that Phillip was a master manipulator and that Nancy was under both his influence and that of substances during the period of Dugard's kidnapping, so should receive some consideration while alluding to parallels with kidnap victim Patty Hearst and to Stockholm syndrome.\n\nOn Thursday, April 7, 2011, instead of pleading guilty, as had been expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos pleaded not guilty to charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.\n\nOn April 28, 2011, the Garridos pleaded guilty to kidnapping and rape by force. On June 2, 2011, Phillip was sentenced to 431 years to life imprisonment; Nancy received 36 years to life imprisonment. Phillip is serving his sentence at California State Prison, Corcoran, while Nancy is incarcerated at Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla. Dugard did not attend the sentencing, instead sending a written message with her mother to read aloud in court.\n\nIn July 2010, the State of California approved a US $20million settlement with Jaycee Dugard to compensate her for: \"various lapses by the Corrections Department [that contributed to] Dugard's continued captivity, ongoing sexual assault and mental and/or physical abuse.\" The settlement, part of AB1714, was approved by the California State Assembly by a 70 to 2 vote, and by the California State Senate by a 30 to 1 vote. San Francisco County Superior Court Judge Daniel Weinstein, who mediated the settlement, stated that the settlement was reached to avoid a lawsuit, which would be a: \"greater invasion of privacy and greater publicity for the state.\" The bill was signed by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger on July 9.\n\nOn September 22, 2011, Dugard filed suit in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip when he was a federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal government that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido at the time he was placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.\n\nOn August 26, 2016 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit dismissed Dugard's civil claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). In a 2-1 decision authored by Judge John B. Owens, the court ruled that the federal government's sovereign immunity was not waived because the U.S. is only liable \"in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances\" under state law. In this case, because the U.S. would not be liable under California law, Dugard could not prevail on her FTCA claim. Chief District Court Judge William Smith again dissented, stating that he believed that the majority misinterpreted California law, as the cases cited by the majority only involved FTCA liability in rehabilitation centers.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4349914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4349914", "title": "Le Journal Hebdomadaire", "text": "Le Journal Hebdomadaire\n\nLe Journal Hebdomadaire (French for The Weekly Journal; often shortened to Le Journal Hebdo) was a French-language, Moroccan weekly magazine, published between 1997 and 2010. It was cofounded by Aboubakr Jamaï, who also co-founded its Arabic-language counterpart, \"Assahifa Al Ousbouia\".\n\nAn MBA by training, at age 29 Jamaï moved from finance into financial journalism, helping to found the Casablanca-based \"Le Journal\". The magazine was first published on 17 November 1997. As a model, the paper's creators used the Spanish paper \"El País\" because of the way it had started as a weekly paper under Francisco Franco's rule before growing into a media conglomerate.\n\nThe journal's circulation was initially small, with the first issue selling only 3,000 copies, primarily to a business audience. However, the journal soon grew by word-of-mouth, attracting a non-business audience and attracting more advertisers. In 1998, Jamaï co-founded an Arabic-language sister publication, \"Assahifa al-Ousbouiya\", designed to appeal to a broader audience.\n\nOn 23 July 1999, Hassan II died, and his son Mohammed VI succeeded him to the throne, raising hopes for democratic reform. \"Le Journal\" soon became critical of Mohamed's reign, however, particularly his slowness in transforming Morocco into a constitutional democracy. As a result of the critical editorials printed by the paper, Moroccan printers soon refused to do business with it, forcing Jamaï to print in France and pay enormous transportation costs.\n\nIn April 2000, \"Le Journal\" \"crossed a political redline\" by printing an interview with Muhammad Abdelaziz, leader of the Saharawi separatist movement Polisario Front that was fighting for the independence of Western Sahara from Morocco. The Moroccan Ministry of Communications responded by banning both \"Le Journal\" and \"Assahifa Al Ousbouia\", though the latter had not run the interview in question. A Ministry spokesperson stated that the reasons for the papers' banning were \"excesses in [their] editorial line concerning the question of Morocco’s territorial integrity\" and \"collusion with foreign interests\". However, following an outcry from foreign governments and NGOs, the papers were allowed to re-open.\n\nThe conflict with the government won Jamaï's papers publicity and popular credibility, and advertising revenues increased substantially for the following months. In November, however, the paper reprinted a letter implicating that a number of socialist politicians, including then-Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi, had participated in a 1972 plot to assassinate Hassan II. The papers were again banned. At the January 2001 Congress of the International Federation for Human Rights in Casablanca, Jamaï took the podium to announce to the applause of the delegates that he would go on a hunger strike until his papers were unbanned. Following another round of international protest—including a question about the banning from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on the occasion of Youssoufi's state visit to Germany—the government relented, and the papers were once more allowed to print.\n\nIn 2006, in its reporting on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy—in which a Danish newspaper published several cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad, triggering widespread anger in the Muslim world--\"Le Journal\" published a blacked-out version of one of the cartoons. The newspaper's offices were then the target of a series of protests, which Jamaï alleges were orchestrated by the national government.\n\nAt the time of the papers' first banning in April 2000, Foreign Minister Mohamed Benaissa filed a defamation lawsuit against Jamaï and Ali Amar, another editor of \"Le Journal\", for a 1999 series of articles alleging that the minister had profited from the sale of an official residence during his tenure as Ambassador to the United States. Jamaï later speculated that Benaissa \"was waiting for a signal\" to attack the papers and that he saw his opportunity following the announcement of the ban. In 2001, the pair were found guilty, and sentenced to pay damages of 2 million dirhams (US$200,000). In addition, Jamaï was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and Amar to two months. Reporters Without Borders immediately called for the Moroccan Justice Minister to overturn the verdict, asserting that \"Fines should not be used by the authorities with the aim of halting the appearance or publication of a media\".\n\nOther lawsuits followed, and by 2006, Jamaï's debts amounted to more than US$1.5 million in fines, damages, and back taxes. In 2002, \"Le Journal\"'s staff was told by a number of companies that had formerly advertised in the paper that they had been pressured by the government no longer to do so. Jamaï speculated to an interviewer that having realized that they could not shut the paper down directly without international pressure, the government was now seeking to bankrupt it.\n\nIn 2006, Jamaï lost another libel suit, this time to Claude Moniquet, director of the Brussels think-tank, the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center; Jamaï had described a report of his on the Polisario Front as \"tele-guided by the royal palace\", and was ordered to pay a US$360,000 fine. The press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) described the trial as \"politically motivated and unfair\", and said that it could prove a \"fatal blow\" to the weekly magazine.\n\nA cousin of Mohammad's, Prince Moulay Hicham Ben Abdallah, offered to settle Jamaï's legal debts, but Jamaï refused, saying that he would \"prefer to force the regime to let the press alone or be exposed for silencing it\". Jamaï then resigned from his papers and traveled to the US, working as a professor at the University of San Diego for three years. He returned to Morocco in 2009.\n\nFaced with growing debts and an advertising boycott, \"Le Journal\" went out of business in 2010. On 16 February 2010, bailiffs arrived with a court order that the paper must cease publication. Jamaï announced to a crowd outside the office that he was leaving journalism, because \"serious journalism has become impossible in Morocco today\". The following year, however, he would go on to found the news website Lakome.com.\n\nIn 2003, The Committee to Protect Journalists presented Jamaï its International Press Freedom Award, \"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\", for his work with \"Le Journal\". In 2010, the World Association of Newspapers awarded him its Gebran Tueni Prize, established in honor of the assassinated Lebanese editor and press freedom advocate of the same name.\n\n"}
{"id": "1405473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1405473", "title": "Lost Cause of the Confederacy", "text": "Lost Cause of the Confederacy\n\nThe Lost Cause of the Confederacy, or simply the Lost Cause, is an American historical negationist ideology that holds that, despite losing the American Civil War, the cause of the Confederacy was a just and heroic one. The ideology endorses the supposed virtues of the antebellum South, viewing the war as a struggle primarily for the Southern way of life or \"states' rights\" in the face of overwhelming \"Northern aggression\". At the same time, the Lost Cause minimizes or denies outright the central role of slavery in the outbreak of the war.\n\nLost Cause ideology emerged in the decades after the war among former Confederate generals and politicians, as well as organizations like the Sons of Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. Particularly intense periods of Lost Cause activity came around the time of World War I, as the last Confederate veterans began to die and a push was made to preserve their memories, and during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, in reaction to growing public support for racial equality. Through activities such as building prominent Confederate monuments and writing school history textbooks, they sought to ensure future generations of Southern whites would know of the South's \"true\" reasons for fighting the war and therefore continue to support white supremacist policies, such as Jim Crow.\n\nThough it synthesizes numerous ideas, proponents of the Lost Cause primarily argued that slavery was not the main cause of the Civil War. In order to reach this conclusion, they directly ignored the declarations of secession by the seceding states, the declarations of congressmen who left Congress to join the Confederacy, and the treatment of slavery in the Confederate constitution. They also denied or minimized the wartime writings and speeches of Confederate leaders in favor of postwar views. (See Cornerstone Speech.) Supporters often stressed the idea of secession as a defense against a Northern threat to their way of life and said that the threat violated the states' rights guaranteed by the Constitution. They believed any state had the right to secede, a point strongly denied by the North. The Lost Cause portrayed the South as more adherent to Christian values than the allegedly greedy North. It portrayed slavery as more benevolent than cruel, alleging that it taught Christianity and \"civilization\". Stories of happy slaves were often used as propaganda in an effort to defend slavery. These stories would be used to explain slavery to Northerners. Many times they also portrayed slave owners being kind to their slaves. In explaining Confederate defeat, the Lost Cause said that the main factor was not qualitative inferiority in leadership or fighting ability but the massive quantitative superiority of the Yankee industrial machine. At the peak of troop strength in 1863, Union soldiers outnumbered Confederate soldiers by over two to one, and financially the Union had three times the bank deposits of the Confederacy.\n\nCritics of the ideology have stated that white supremacy is a key characteristic of the Lost Cause narrative. Supporters typically portray the Confederacy's cause as noble and its leadership as exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry and honor, defeated by the Union armies through numerical and industrial force that overwhelmed the South's superior military skill and courage. Proponents of the Lost Cause movement also condemned the Reconstruction that followed the Civil War, claiming that it had been a deliberate attempt by Northern politicians and speculators to destroy the traditional Southern way of life. In recent decades Lost Cause themes have been widely promoted by the Neo-Confederate movement in books and op-eds, and especially in one of the movement's magazines, the \"Southern Partisan\". The Lost Cause theme has been a major element in defining gender roles in the white South, in terms of honor, tradition, and family roles. The Lost Cause has inspired many prominent Southern memorials and even religious attitudes.\n\nMany white Southerners were devastated economically, emotionally, and psychologically by the defeat of the Confederacy. Before the war, many Southerners proudly felt that their rich military tradition and superior dedication to the concept of honor would enable them to prevail in the conflict. When this did not happen, white Southerners sought consolation in attributing their loss to factors beyond their control, such as physical size and overwhelming brute force.\n\nUniversity of Virginia professor Gary W. Gallagher wrote:\n\nYale University history professor Rollin G. Osterweis summarizes the content that pervaded \"Lost Cause\" writings:\n\nLouisiana State University history professor Gaines Foster wrote in 2013:\n\nThe term \"Lost Cause\" first appeared in the title of an 1866 book by the Virginian author and journalist Edward A. Pollard, \"The Lost Cause: A New Southern History of the War of the Confederates\". Pollard promotes many of the aforementioned themes of the Lost Cause. In particular, he dismisses the role of slavery in starting the war and understates the cruelty of American slavery, even promoting it as a way of improving the lives of Africans:\n\nHowever, it was the articles written by General Jubal A. Early in the 1870s for the Southern Historical Society that firmly established the Lost Cause as a long-lasting literary and cultural phenomenon. The 1881 publication of \"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government\" by Jefferson Davis, a two-volume defense of the Southern cause, provided another important text in the history of the Lost Cause. Davis blamed the enemy for \"whatever of bloodshed, of devastation, or shock to republican government has resulted from the war\". He charged that the Yankees fought \"with a ferocity that disregarded all the laws of civilized warfare\". The book remained in print and was often used to justify the Southern position and to distance it from slavery.\n\nEarly's original inspiration for his views may have come from General Robert E. Lee. When Lee published his farewell order to the Army of Northern Virginia, he consoled his soldiers by speaking of the \"overwhelming resources and numbers\" that the Confederate army fought against. In a letter to Early, Lee requested information about enemy strengths from May 1864 to April 1865, the period in which his army was engaged against Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg). Lee wrote, \"My only object is to transmit, if possible, the truth to posterity, and do justice to our brave Soldiers.\" In another letter, Lee wanted all \"statistics as regards numbers, destruction of private property by the Federal troops, &c.\" because he intended to demonstrate the discrepancy in strength between the two armies and believed it would \"be difficult to get the world to understand the odds against which we fought\". Referring to newspaper accounts that accused him of culpability in the loss, he wrote, \"I have not thought proper to notice, or even to correct misrepresentations of my words & acts. We shall have to be patient, & suffer for awhile at least. ... At present the public mind is not prepared to receive the truth.\" All of these were themes made prominent by Early and the Lost Cause writers in the nineteenth century and that continued to be important throughout the twentieth.\n\nIn a November 1868 report, U.S. Army general George Henry Thomas, a Virginian who fought for the Union in the war, noted efforts made by former Confederates to paint the Confederacy in a positive light, stating:\n\nMemorial associations such as the United Confederate Veterans, the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and Ladies Memorial Associations integrated Lost Cause themes to help white, Confederate-sympathizing Southerners cope with the many changes during this era, most significantly Reconstruction. These institutions have lasted to the present and descendants of Southern soldiers continue to attend their meetings.\n\nIn 1879 John McElroy published \"Andersonville: A Story of Rebel Military Prisons\" which was highly critical of the Confederate treatment of prisoners; he implied in the preface that the mythology of the Confederacy was well established and that criticism of the otherwise-lionized Confederates was met with disdain:\n\nBasic assumptions of the Lost Cause have proved durable for many in the modern South. Lost Cause tenets are frequently voiced during controversies surrounding public display of the Confederate flags and various state flags. Historian John Coski noted that the Sons of Confederate Veterans, the \"most visible, active, and effective defender of the flag\", \"carried forward into the twenty-first century, virtually unchanged, the Lost Cause historical interpretations and ideological vision formulated at the turn of the twentieth\". Coski wrote concerning \"the flag wars of the late twentieth century\":\n\nThe Confederate States of America used several flags during its existence from 1861 to 1865. Since the end of the American Civil War, personal and official use of Confederate flags, and of flags derived from these, has continued under considerable controversy. The current state flag of Mississippi, created in 1894 after the state's \"Redemption\", includes the Confederate battle flag.\n\nOn March 23, 2015, a Confederate-flag-related case reached the Supreme Court of the United States. \"Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans\" centered on whether or not the state of Texas could deny a request by the SCV for vanity license plates that incorporated a Confederate battle flag. The case was heard by the Court on March 23, 2015. On June 18, 2015, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 vote, held that Texas was entitled to reject the SCV proposal.\n\nIn October 2015 outrage erupted online at the discovery of a Texan school's geography textbook which described slaves as \"immigrants\" and \"workers\". The publisher, McGraw-Hill, announced that it would change the wording. Many have interpreted this as the legacy of the minimization and trivialization of slavery associated with the Lost Cause movement.\n\nNolan states that the Lost Cause \"facilitated the reunification of the North and the South\". He quotes Foster, who says, \"signs of respect from former foes and northern publishers made acceptance of reunion easier. By the mid-eighties, most southerners had decided to build a future within a reunited nation. A few remained irreconcilable, but their influence in southern society declined rapidly.\" Nolan's second aspect is that, \"The reunion was exclusively a white man's phenomenon and the price of the reunion was the sacrifice of the African Americans.\"\n\nHistorian Caroline Janney stated:\n\nYale historian David W. Blight wrote:\n\nIn exploring the literature of reconciliation, historian William Tynes Cowa wrote, \"The cult of the Lost Cause was part of a larger cultural project: the reconciliation of North and South after the Civil War.\" He says that a typical image in postwar fiction was a materialistic, rich Yankee man marrying an impoverished spiritual Southern bride as a symbol of happy national reunion. Examining films and visual art, Gallagher identifies the theme of \"white people North and South [who] extol the \"American\" virtues both sides manifested during the war, to exalt the restored nation that emerged from the conflict, and to mute the role of African Americans\".\n\nBruce Catton argues that the myth or legend helped achieve national reconciliation between North and South. He concludes, \"the legend of the lost cause has served the entire country very well\", and he goes on to say:\n\nHistorians have said that the \"Lost Cause\" theme helped white Southerners adjust to their new status and move forward into what was called \"the New South\". Hillyer states that the Confederate Memorial Literary Society (CMLS), founded by elite white women in Richmond, Virginia, in the 1890s, exemplifies this solution. The CMLS founded the Confederate Museum to document and defend the Confederate cause and to recall the antebellum mores that the new South's business ethos was thought to be displacing. By focusing on military sacrifice, rather than grievances regarding the North, the Confederate Museum aided the process of sectional reconciliation, according to Hillyer. By depicting slavery as benevolent, the museum's exhibits reinforced the notion that Jim Crow laws were a proper solution to racial tensions that had escalated during Reconstruction. Lastly, by glorifying the common soldier and portraying the South as \"solid,\" the museum promoted acceptance of industrial capitalism. Thus, the Confederate Museum both critiqued and eased the economic transformations of the New South, and enabled Richmond to reconcile its memory of the past with its hopes for the future, leaving the past behind as it developed new industrial and financial roles.\n\nHistorian Jacquelyn Dowd Hall states that the Lost Cause theme was fully developed around 1900 in a mood not of despair but of triumphalism for the New South. Much was left out of the Lost Cause:\n\nCharles Wilson argues that many white Southerners, most of whom were conservative and pious evangelical Protestants, sought answers to Confederate defeat in religion. They felt that defeat in the war was God's punishment for their sins, and turned increasingly to religion as their solace. The postwar era saw the birth of a regional \"civil religion\" that was heavy with symbolism and ritual; clergymen were the primary celebrants. Wilson says that the ministers constructed:\n\nWhite southerners tried to defend on a cultural and religious level what defeat in 1865 made impossible on a political level. The Lost Cause—defeat in a holy war—left southerners to face guilt, doubt, and the triumph of evil: that is, they formed what C. Vann Woodward has called a uniquely Southern sense of the tragedy of history.\"\n\nPoole has said that in fighting to defeat the Republican reconstruction government in South Carolina in 1876, white Democrats portrayed the Lost Cause scenario through \"Hampton Days\" celebrations shouting \"Hampton or Hell!\". They staged the contest between reconstruction opponent and Democratic candidate Wade Hampton and incumbent governor Daniel H. Chamberlain as a religious struggle between good and evil, and calling for \"redemption\". Indeed, throughout the South the conservatives who overthrew Reconstruction were often called \"Redeemers,\" echoing Christian theology.\n\nAmong the writers on the Lost Cause, gender roles were contested domain. Men typically hurried by the role women played during the war, noting their total loyalty to the cause. Women, however, developed a much different approach that emphasized female activism, initiative, and leadership. They explained that when all the men left, the women took command, found substitute foods, rediscovered their old traditional skills with the spinning wheel when factory cloth became unavailable, and ran all the farm or plantation operations. They faced apparent danger without having men in the traditional role of their protectors.\n\nThe duty of memorializing the Confederate dead was a major activity for Southerners devoted to the Lost Cause; chapters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) played the central role. The UDC was especially influential in the early twentieth century across the South, where its main role was to preserve and uphold the memory of the Confederate veterans, especially those husbands, sons, fathers and brothers who died in the war. Its long-term impact was to promote the Lost Cause image of the antebellum plantation South as an idealized society crushed by the forces of Yankee modernization which undermined traditional gender roles. In Missouri, a border state, the United daughters of the Confederacy was active in setting up its own system of memorials. Hall said that the UDC was a powerful promoter of women's history:\n\nIndeed, there is even some evidence suggesting that there was a link between the publication of Lost Cause books and the creation of the confederate memorials: Lizzie Cary Daniel's \"Confederate Scrap-book\" makes clear in the preface and on the title page that it was specifically published to fund the erection of two (implied confederate) memorials. The book therefore plays the dual roles of glorifying the Confederates in songs, poems and other war memorabilia, while also paying for their more enduring and public memorialization.\n\nThe Southern states set up their own pension system for veterans and their dependents, especially widows. They were not eligible for the Federal pension system. The pensions were designed to honor the Lost Cause, and help reduce the severe poverty prevalent in the region. Male applicants for pensions had to demonstrate their continued loyalty to the \"lost cause\". Female applicants were rejected if their moral reputation was in question.\n\nIn Natchez, Mississippi, the local newspapers and veterans played a role in the maintenance of the Lost Cause. However elite white women were central in establishing memorials such as the Civil War Monument dedicated on Memorial Day 1890. The Lost Cause enabled women noncombatants to lay a claim to the central event in their redefinition of Southern history.\n\nThe UDC was quite prominent, but not at all unique in its appeal to upscale white southern women. \"The number of women's clubs devoted to filiopietism and history was staggering,\" says historian W. Fitzhugh Brundage. He notes two typical club women in Texas and Mississippi, who between them belonged to the United Daughters of the Confederacy, Daughters of the American Revolution, Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities, Daughters of the Pilgrims, Daughters of the War of 1812, Daughters of Colonial Governors, and Daughters of the Founders and Patriots of America, Order of the First Families of Virginia, and the Colonial Dames of America, as well as a few other historically oriented societies. Comparable men, on the other hand, were much less interested in historical organizations, and devoted their energies to secret fraternal societies, while they emphasized athletic, political and financial exploits to prove their manhood. Brundage notes that after women's suffrage came in 1920, the historical role of the women's organizations eroded.\n\nIn their heyday in the first two decades of the 20th century, Brundage concludes that:\n\nThese women architects of whites' historical memory, by both explaining and mystifying the historical roots of white supremacy and elite power in the South, performed a conspicuous civic function at a time of heightened concern about the perpetuation of social and political hierarchies. Although denied the franchise, organized white women nevertheless played a dominant role in crafting the historical memory that would inform and undergird southern politics and public life.\n\nSome of the main tenets of the Lost Cause movement were that:\n\nThe most powerful images and symbols of the Lost Cause were Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, and Pickett's Charge. David Ulbrich wrote, \"Already revered during the war, Robert E. Lee acquired a divine mystique within Southern culture after it. Remembered as a leader whose soldiers would loyally follow him into every fight no matter how desperate, Lee emerged from the conflict to become an icon of the Lost Cause and the ideal of the antebellum Southern gentleman, an honorable and pious man who selflessly served Virginia and the Confederacy. Lee's tactical brilliance at Second Bull Run and Chancellorsville took on legendary status, and despite his accepting full responsibility for the defeat at Gettysburg, Lee remained largely infallible for Southerners and was spared criticism even from historians until recent times.\" Victor Davis Hansen points out that Albert Sidney Johnston was the first officer to be appointed a full general by Jefferson Davis and to lead Confederate forces in the Western Theater. His death during the first day of the battle at Shiloh arguably led to the Confederacy's defeat in that conflict.\n\nIn terms of Lee's subordinates, the key villain in Jubal Early's view was General Longstreet. Despite the fact that General Lee took all responsibility for the defeats (in particular the one at Gettysburg), Early's writings place the Confederate defeat at Gettysburg squarely on Longstreet's shoulders, accusing him of failing to attack early in the morning of July 2, 1863, as instructed by Lee. In fact, however, Lee never expressed dissatisfaction with the second-day actions of his \"Old War Horse\". Longstreet was widely disparaged by Southern veterans because of his post-war cooperation with President Ulysses S. Grant (with whom he had shared a close friendship before the war) and for joining the Republican Party. Grant, in rejecting the Lost Cause arguments, said in an 1878 interview that he rejected the notion that the South had simply been overwhelmed by numbers. Grant wrote that \"This is the way public opinion was made during the war and this is the way history is made now. We never overwhelmed the South ... What we won from the South we won by hard fighting.\" He further noted that when comparing resources the \"4,000,000 of negroes\" who \"kept the farms, protected the families, supported the armies, and were really a reserve force\" were not treated as a southern asset.\n\nOne essential element of the Lost Cause movement was that the act of secession itself had been legitimate; otherwise, all of the Confederacy's leading figures would have become traitors. In order to legitimize the Confederacy's rebellion, Lost Cause intellectuals challenged the legitimacy of the federal government and the actions of Abraham Lincoln as President. This is exemplified in \"Force or Consent as the Basis of American Government\" by Mary Scrugham, in which she presents frivolous arguments against the legality of Lincoln's presidency. These include his receiving a minority (and unmentioned plurality) of the popular vote in the 1860 election and the false assertion that he made his position on slavery ambiguous. These accusations, though thoroughly refuted, gave rise to the belief that the North initiated the Civil War, making a designation of \"The War of Northern Aggression\" possible as one of the names of the American Civil War.\n\nAnother prominent use of the Lost Cause perspective was in Thomas F. Dixon, Jr.'s 1905 novel \"The Clansman\", later adapted to the screen by D. W. Griffith in his highly successful but controversial \"The Birth of a Nation\" in 1915. Noting that Dixon and Griffith collaborated on \"Birth of a Nation\", Blight wrote:\n\nDixon's vicious version of the idea that blacks had caused the Civil War by their very presence, and that Northern radicalism during Reconstruction failed to understand that freedom had ushered blacks as a race into barbarism, neatly framed the story of the rise of heroic vigilantism in the South. Reluctantly, Klansmen—white men—had to take the law into their own hands in order to save Southern white womanhood from the sexual brutality of black men. Dixon's vision captured the attitude of thousands and forged in story form a collective memory of how the war may have been lost but Reconstruction was won—by the South and a reconciled nation. Riding as masked cavalry, the Klan stopped corrupt government, prevented the anarchy of 'Negro rule,' and most of all, saved white supremacy.\n\nIn both the book and the movie, the Ku Klux Klan is portrayed as continuing the noble traditions of the antebellum South and the heroic Confederate soldier by defending Southern culture in general and Southern womanhood in particular against rape and depredations at the hands of the Freedmen and Yankee carpetbaggers during Reconstruction. Dixon's narrative was so readily adopted that the film is credited with the revival of the Klan in the 1910s and 1920s. This second Klan reached a peak membership of 2-5 million members. The film's legacy is wide-reaching in the history of American racism; even the now-iconic cross burnings of the KKK were based on the book (the first KKK did not burn crosses - it was originally a Scottish tradition named \"Crann Tara\", designed to gather clans for war).\n\nThe Lost Cause view reached tens of millions of Americans in the best-selling 1936 novel \"Gone with the Wind\" by Margaret Mitchell and the Oscar-winning 1939 film. Helen Taylor has written that:\n\n\"Gone with the Wind\" has almost certainly done its ideological work. It has sealed in popular imaginations a fascinated nostalgia for the glamorous southern plantation house and ordered hierarchical society in which slaves are 'family,' and there is a mystical bond between the landowner and the rich soil those slaves work for him. It has spoken eloquently—albeit from an elitist perspective—of the grand themes (war, love, death, conflicts of race, class, gender, and generation) that have crossed continents and cultures.\n\nBlight wrote:\nFrom this combination of Lost Cause voices a reunited America arose pure, guiltless, and assured that the deep conflicts in its past had been imposed upon it by otherworldly forces. The side that lost was especially assured that its cause was true and good. One of the ideas the reconciliationist Lost Cause instilled deeply into the national culture is that even when Americans lose, they win. Such was the message, the indomitable spirit, that Margaret Mitchell infused into her character Scarlett O'Hara in \"Gone With the Wind\"...\n\nSoutherners were portrayed as noble, heroic figures, living in a doomed romantic society, who rejected the realistic advice offered by the Rhett Butler character and never understood the risk they were taking in going to war.\n\nThe 2003 Civil War film \"Gods and Generals\", based on Jeff Shaara's 1998 novel of the same name, is widely viewed as championing the Lost Cause ideology by creating a presentation that was favorable to the Confederacy.\n\nWriting in the Journal of American History, historian Steven E. Woodworth derided the movie as a modern day telling of Lost Cause mythology. Woodworth called the movie \"the most pro-Confederate film since \"Birth of a Nation\", a veritable celluloid celebration of slavery and treason\". He summed up his reasons for disliking the movie by saying:\n\nWoodworth criticized the portrayal of slaves as being \"generally happy\" with their condition. He also criticizes the relative lack of attention given to the motivations of Union soldiers fighting in the war. He excoriates the film for allegedly implying, in agreement with Lost Cause mythology, that the South was more \"sincerely Christian\". Woodworth concludes that the film, through \"judicial omission,\" presents \"a distorted view of the Civil War\".\n\nHistorian William B. Feis similarly criticized the director's decision \"to champion the more simplistic-and sanitized-interpretations found in post-war \"Lost Cause\" mythology\". Film critic Roger Ebert described the movie as \"a Civil War movie that Trent Lott might enjoy\" and said of its Lost Cause themes, \"If World War II were handled this way, there'd be hell to pay.\"\n\nThe consensus of film critics for this movie was that it had a firm \"pro-confederate slant\".\n\nIn his novels about the Sartoris family, William Faulkner referenced those who supported the Lost Cause ideal, while suggesting that the ideal itself was misguided and out of date.\n\nProfessor Gallagher contends that Douglas Southall Freeman's definitive four-volume biography of Lee, published in 1934, \"cemented in American letters an interpretation of Lee very close to Early's utterly heroic figure\". In this work, Lee's subordinates were primarily to blame for errors that lost battles. While Longstreet was the most common target of such attacks, others came under fire as well. Richard Ewell, Jubal Early, J. E. B. Stuart, A. P. Hill, George Pickett, and many others were frequently attacked and blamed by Southerners in an attempt to deflect criticism from Lee.\n\nHudson Strode wrote a widely read scholarly three-volume biography of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. A leading scholarly journal reviewed it stressing Strode's political biases:\nHis [Jefferson Davis's] enemies are devils, and his friends, like Davis himself, have been canonized. Strode not only attempts to sanctify Davis but also the Confederate point of view, and this study should be relished by those vigorously sympathetic with the Lost Cause.\n\nThe Texas Civil War Museum has been called in 2018 \"a lovely bit of 'Lost Cause' propaganda\".\n\nContemporary historians overwhelmingly agree that secession was motivated by slavery. There were numerous causes for secession, but preservation and expansion of slavery was easily the most important of them. The confusion may come from blending the causes of secession with the causes of the war—which are separate but related issues. (Lincoln did not enter a military conflict to free the slaves but to put down a rebellion.) According to historian Kenneth M. Stampp, each side supported states' rights or federal power only when it was convenient to do so. Stampp also cited Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens's \"A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States\" as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the \"cornerstone of the Confederacy\" when the war began and then said that the war was not about slavery but states' rights after Southern defeat. According to Stampp, Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the 'Lost Cause' theory.\n\nSimilarly, historian William C. Davis explained the Confederate Constitution's protection of slavery at the national level as follows:\n\nTo the old Union they had said that the Federal power had no authority to interfere with slavery issues in a state. To their new nation they would declare that the state had no power to interfere with a federal protection of slavery. Of all the many testimonials to the fact that slavery, and not states' rights, really lay at the heart of their movement, this was the most eloquent of all.\n\nDavis further notes that, \"Causes and effects of the war have been manipulated and mythologized to suit political and social agendas, past and present.\" Historian David Blight says that \"its use of white supremacy as both means and ends\" has been a key characteristic of the Lost Cause. Historian Allan Nolan writes:\n\n... the Lost Cause legacy to history is a caricature of the truth. The caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter. Surely it is time to start again in our understanding of this decisive element of our past and to do so from the premises of history unadulterated by the distortions, falsehoods, and romantic sentimentality of the Myth of the Lost Cause.\n\nThere are modern Lost Cause writers of history, such as James Ronald Kennedy and his twin brother Walter Donald Kennedy (founders of The League of the South and author of \"The South Was Right!\" and \"Jefferson Davis Was Right!\"), who play down slavery as a cause in favor of Southern nationalism. The Kennedys describe \"the terrorist methods\" and \"heinous crimes\" committed by the Union during the war and then in a chapter titled \"The Yankee Campaign of Cultural Genocide\" state that they will show \"from the United States government's own official records that the primary motivating factor was a desire of those in power to punish and to exterminate the Southern nation and in many cases to procure the extermination of the Southern people\".\n\nIn arguing why the theme of this book is important to contemporary Southerners, the Kennedys write in the conclusion of their work:\n\nHistorian David Goldfield characterizes books \"such as \"The South Was Right\"\" as:\n\nHistorian William C. Davis labels many of the myths surrounding the war as \"frivolous\" and included attempts to rename the war by \"Confederate partisans\" which continue to this day. He states that names such as the War of Northern Aggression and the expression coined by Alexander Stephens, War Between the States, were just attempts to deny that the Civil War was an actual civil war.\n\nHistorian A. Cash Koiniger has theorized that Gary Gallagher has mischaracterized films that depict the Lost Cause. He writes, Gallagher:\n\n... concedes that \"Lost Cause themes\" (with the important exception of minimizing the importance of slavery) are based on historical truths (p. 46). Confederate soldiers were often outnumbered, ragged, and hungry; southern civilians did endure much material deprivation and a disproportionate amount of bereavement; U.S. forces did wreck \"\" havoc on southern infrastructure and private property and the like, yet whenever these points appear in films Gallagher considers them motifs \"celebratory\" of the Confederacy (p. 81).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4414271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4414271", "title": "MIX NYC", "text": "MIX NYC\n\nMIX NYC is a not-for-profit organization based in New York City and dedicated to queer experimental film. It is also known as the \"MIX festival,\" for its most visible program, the annual New York Lesbian and Gay Experimental Film Festival (NYLGEFF), which has featured early works by filmmakers such as Christine Vachon, Todd Haynes, Isaac Julien, Thomas Allen Harris, Barbara Hammer, Jonathan Caouette, Jennie Livingston, and Matthew Mishory.\n\nMIX was founded in 1987 by Sarah Schulman and Jim Hubbard. The festival was created because newly emerging Gay Film Festivals were not including formally inventive work, and the then vibrant experimental film venues marginalized gay and lesbian work. They were aided by curators Jack Waters and Peter Cramer from Naked Eye Cinema and Ela Troyano who programmed The New York Film Festival Downtown. The first festival featured the world premiere of Su Freidrich's \"Damned If You Don't\", and from then on the festival became a showcase for new works by established makers, archival masters like Barbara Rubin's \"Christmas on Earth\", and new emerging artists. Quickly, in concert with the emerging AIDS Activist and Queer Activist movement of the day- The New York Lesbian & Gay Experimental Film Festival (NYLGEFF) became a mass cultural event in the LGBT underground. Friday nights were guaranteed sold-out \"Lesbian Date Nights\" and a counter-culture of new interest in filmmaking and video production emerged around the festival community. MIX soon became very influential on other programming venues, often contributing significant work to The Whitney Biennial, Berlin International Film Festival and other important screens. MIX exhibited first films by major lesbian, gay and bisexual filmmakers including Todd Haynes' college thesis film, \"Assassins: A Film Concerning Rimbaud,\" (which got him his first review, ever), Maria Maggenti's \"Name Day\", the first screening of \"Paris Is Burning\", when it was still on a dual system, Christine Vachon's first film, and many others. Hubbard and Schulman prioritized artists' fees, paying all makers equally regardless of the length of their work, since in experimental film, labor intensivity was not determined by length. They included the first focus on films by and about black gay men in any film Festival. Schulman and Hubbard worked long and hard to get press review coverage for gay experimental work, often holding individual press screenings at the critic's convenience. They hand wheatpasted posters on buildings around the city, and leafleted areas where gay people hung out, like the piers and bars. MIX received no funding and managed to break even on enthusiastic box office support. They showed gay experimental film from other countries and brought films by hand to venues around the US, Europe and Japan. The festival has shown the work of filmmakers such as Barbara Hammer, Nisha Ganatra, Teri Rice, Jonathan Caouette, and Isaac Julien among hundreds more. As makers began to die of AIDS, Jim became active in film preservation, beginning with the film \"Avocada\" by the late Bill Vehr of the Ridiculous Theatrical Company. Eventually, he preserved over 2,000 hours of AIDS Film and Video, now available for free viewing at the New York Public Library. During Sarah and Jim's tenure, no one was ever turned away from MIX due to inability to pay. The festival also included Transsexual work from the very first year, with Marguerite Paris's film \"All Women Are Equal\". They found ways of getting works by makers like Chantal Ackerman who did not show in gay festivals. Among many fabulous moments in the festival's history was MIX's screening of Andy Warhol's \"Blow Job\" which was attended by Kitty Carlisle Hart in a gown with a tuxedo'd escort.\n\nHubbard & Schulman ran the festival together as a community event from 1987-1991. After the 1991 festival, Schulman wanted to devote more time to her writing. The 1992 festival was organized by Hubbard and filmmakers Margueite Paris and Jerry Tartaglia. That year also introduced shows programmed by guest curators, who brought new perspectives to the line-up. Notable shows included Our Fanzine Friends, which drew upon the hot trend of queer zines, featuring work by Glenn Belverio and Bruce LaBruce; and \"Fire\", featuring work from the African diaspora. This last program featured work by Dawn Suggs, Shari Frilot, Thomas Allen Harris and others.\n\nIn 1993 Frilot and Karim Ainouz were the co-directors, and introduced many changes, including the name MIX, the production of a catalog (instead of handing our program notes), a new venue (The Kitchen instead of Anthology Film Archives) and a commitment to multicultural presentations and installation work. A stunning program that year was called The 1000 Dreams of Desire, curated by Jim Lyons. It was a special show featuring Teri Rice's \"The Kindling Point\" and \"Les Affaires\", at the Ann Street Bookstore in Lower Manhattan, where the peep booths were reprogrammed with experimental video, and 16mm film was projected in a separate room. MIX returned to Anthology in 1994, and combined with DCTV's Lookout Lesbian & Gay Video Festival because DCTV's building was under renovation. Ainouz scaled back his involvement, and Frilot became the definitive voice of MIX, making the organization a home for emerging filmmakers and makers of color. This was signaled by 1994's opening feature, Brincando El Charco, and even more powerfully when 1995's opening and closing events were films by makers of color These films, Vintage: Families of Value by Thomas Allen Harris, and Frilot's own documentary Black Nations/Queer Nations, brought new audiences to MIX. They started satellite festivals such as MIX Brasil (1993) and MIX Mexico (1996).\n\n1996 was the festival's 10th anniversary, and in honor of this milestone MIX presented queer work from the African diaspora at the Victoria Theater in Harlem, in addition to its downtown programs at NYU's Cantor Film Center and the Knitting Factory.\n\nFrilot headed MIX through 1996. Her other legacy was a commitment to installation work and the nascent digital realm. Installations were on view in 1993, on the upper floor of the Kitchen. But in 1994, Shu Lea Cheang and Beth Stryker curated Cyberqueer, in the basement galleries of Anthology. Although installations were presented in subsequent years, they never matched these early efforts until new MIX NYC staff began devoting substantial space and resources to installations in 2006. Frilot went on to become a curator at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nRajendra Roy was in charge in 1997, when the festival moved to Cinema Village, which was then a single-screen theater on E. 12th Street. In 1997 Ernesto Foronda and Maïa Cybelle Carpenter were programming coordinators for the festival. Carpenter stayed on until 1999, also curating additional programs in the years to follow. Roy brought on Anie Stanley as artistic director in 1998, and as a team they propelled MIX to greater visibility, with more corporate sponsorship, but with less emphasis on the identity politics of the early 1990s. 1998 also saw a sidebar of 8 mm films curated by Stephen Kent Jusick, featuring work by both contemporary makers and old masters, such as Jack Smith, and Andy Warhol's Polavision home movies. Roy is now the Celeste Bartos Chief Curator of Film at The Museum of Modern Art.\n\nRoy & Stanley stepped down after the 2000 festival, making way for Ioannis Mookas, who took the title of Executive Director. The organization, whose offices had been in the financial district, suffered after 9/11, and Mookas left after overseeing two festivals.\n\nMIX NYC as an organization took a new direction in 2003, when it initiated the ACT UP Oral History Project, run by Hubbard and Schulman (www.actuporalhistory.org), and funded by a grant from the Ford Foundation. This new effort gave the organization another aspect, different from being just a film festival.\n\nLarry Shea and Stephen Winter took the helm of the festival in 2003. Jonathan Caouette's Tarnation was shepherded into being under Winter's supervision, and its premiere as the festival centerpiece was the beginning of its illustrious path to Cannes, the New York Film Festival and a distribution deal with Wellspring in 2004. Shea and Winter also reimagined the 1000 Dreams of Desire program from 1993, re-staging it, with differences, at the same Ann Street location as the original. This time, in addition to the video booths and screening room on the upper floors, the basement was also cleared out, and set up with DJs, ambient 16mm & 8mm film projections, and a dance floor.\n\nA large-scale installation called \"Cake\", about garment workers, by Mary Ellen Strom & Ann Carlson, debuted at South Street Seaport as the festival centerpiece. MIX expanded beyond the concept of the annual festival more in late 2004, with the introduction of MIXtv, which aired weekly on Manhattan Neighborhood Network.\n\nYet MIX was unable to capitalize on the success of Tarnation, and financial troubles led Shea to move the festival from November to April 2005, skipping 2004 entirely. The opening night \"happening\" was held at the Gershwin Hotel, while regular screenings were at Anthology Film Archives. Jim Morrison created silk-screened T-shirts for the festival, the first time MIX had shirts since 1996. MIX began a community screening program, which took work to various neighborhoods and communities, beginning with the Bronx in February 2005.\n\nLarry Shea left MIX after the 2005 festival to devote more time to his video art, and a new team was appointed in the fall, including Andre Hereford, Szu Burgess, Kate Huh and Stephen Kent Jusick. Moving MIX back to its traditional November timeslot was the first decision of the new staff.\n\nIn May 2006, MIX began the Naked Eye Celebrity Camera benefit, auctioning off disposable cameras exposed by artists and celebrities including Laurie Anderson, Gus Van Sant, B.D. Wong, Alec Soth and over 100 others. The 2006 festival, the 19th, was held at the new 3LD Art & Technology Center in Lower Manhattan, and featured two screening rooms as well as window installations and an installations lounge.\n\nThe 2007 festival began with a name change, to the New York Queer Experimental Film Festival, after a few years of requests from the public to a name more inclusive than \"Lesbian and Gay\" and embracing of contemporary terminology. The festival was held in an empty storefront in SoHo, and marked a shift away from traditional theater venues. Installations covered the space, and led back to the makeshift screening room. Additional installations were in the mezzanine, overlooking the whole space. Many shows were packed, including the \"Butt\" magazine show, and Homoccult and other Esoterotica, guest curated by Daniel McKernan and Richie Rennt. Another highlight was a screening of a rare 16mm print shot by Women's Liberation Cinema (Kate Millett and Susan Kleckner, among others) of the 1971 gay pride march in New York. For this screening Sharon Hayes performed a live audio accompaniment. Hayes continued working with this material, and the film and recorded audio were included in Hayes's show at the Whitney Museum in 2012.\n\nIn 2008 MIX took over a former Liz Claiborne department store in the South Street Seaport, filling every nook and cranny with installations, decorations and performances. The festival took place in October, earlier than its traditional mid-November dates, because the space, donated free of charge by the landlord, was only available at that time. This year MIX NYC initiated a program of artist-designed T-shirts celebrating the festival, each available in a limited edition.\n\nThe 2009 festival took place in Chelsea for the first time since 1993, this time in an empty storefront of a newly constructed condo building. Ceiling to floor glass windows gave MIX unprecedented street visibility, including projections by Lori Hiris and Kadet Kuhne. Installations were prominent again, most notably a large geodesic dome that was \"Wildflowers of Manitoba\", by Luis Jacob and Noam Gonick. A live actor inhabited the dome, silently lying there, listening to records, lighting incense and ruminating, while 3 projections illuminated some of the panels with scenes of a same-sex love and commitment. The closing night feature \"Maggots & Men,\" by Carey Cronenwett, was sold out, as were several other shows. The festival suffered some noise complaints from condo residents above, who felt that festival-goers were too loud.\n\nThe 2010 festival was held at Theater for the New City, back in the East Village. Using three theater spaces in the TNC complex, MIX emphasized an immersive environment with a string art design in the venue by Diego Montoya. One smaller theater contained a performative installation by Daniel Pillis. Another theater was turned into an installation lounge, anchored by Blaise Garber-Paul's Queer Fruit Tree, which grew and changed throughout the week, and under which visitors could sit on astroturf, or on conical black cushions. The closing night film was Bruce LaBruce's L.A. Zombie, which sold out, and a second screening was added.\n\nIn 2011 MIX took over a disused theater on Bleecker Street. The festival trailer, made on 16mm film by Gina Carducci, was projected on a continuous loop onto the building across the street, above the subway entrance. The venue design told a story of sorts. The lobby was dark with back-lit curtains that gave the impression of being in outer space. From there visitors could enter the screening room, or venture through lush psychedelic forest, and down steps to a subterranean space cave made of pink paper mache and pointy pink pillows. This downstairs space was a lounge, had a second stage used for performances, and contained most of the installations, including work by Adriana Varella, Szu Burgess, Coco Rico and others. The Occupy Wall Street movement was going on at the same time, and the NYPD raided Zuccotti Park just before the festival opened. As a result, MIX made the decision to open the venue as a sanctuary for queer Occupiers.\n\nThe 25th MIX Festival took place in a two-story 20,000 sf former nut roasting factory in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn, the first time the festival had been held outside Manhattan. The first floor was a wide-open space that contained all of the many installations, as well as a small performance stage and many lounging areas. An interior design of spandex \"explosions\" filled the space, often running from ceiling to floor. The second floor, accessible only by a steep staircase, held the screening room, as well as 2 restrooms and administrative space. The closing night film was She Said Boom, about the Toronto band Fifth Column, with band member Caroline Azar in attendance.\n\nAfter the success of the festival in Brooklyn, the festival returned to Gowanus in 2013, taking over a 25,000 ft warehouse, which gave over about 15,000 sf to installation work, and 3600 sf screening room. The festival's visual theme was body parts, and a giant inflatable lung, which breathed slightly, greeted festival-goers as they entered. There were other inflatables, including Rachel Shannon's Breastival Vestibules, and other plastics that resembled veins. Jonathan Caouette returned to the festival with a new film that he finished hours before the screening at MIX NYC.\n\n\n"}

Kennedy assassination, stating that she was involved with a group of anti-Cuban militants, Frank Sturgis of the CIA, and E. Howard Hunt of CIA and Watergate infamy shortly before the assassination.\n\nShe was born Ilona Marita Lorenz in Bremen, the daughter of Alice June (née Lofland) and Heinrich Lorenz. She has a sister, Valerie, and two brothers, Joachim and Manfred \"Philip\". Her father was a German maritime commercial ship captain; and her mother, who was born in Delaware, was an actress and dancer who performed under the stage name June Paget. Her mother was accused of helping forced laborers in Bremen escape, and Marita and her mother were incarcerated in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\n\nFreed after the war, she spent some time traveling with her father on his passenger liner.\n\nIn February 1959, weeks after the conclusion of the Cuban Revolution, Lorenz arrived in Havana with her father on board of the MS \"Berlin\". Fidel Castro and his men visited the ship and the \"Máximo Líder\" took a liking to the nineteen-year-old girl. After dinner, the Berlin set sail for New York. Marita disembarked in Manhattan, where she would be living with her brother Joachim, a student at Columbia University. A few days after she arrived, Castro called Marita—she had given him Joachim’s home number on a matchbox before parting ways—and said he was sending a plane to fly her back to Cuba. A jeep picked Marita up at the other end and drove her to the Havana Hilton, which Castro had repurposed as his base of operations. She lived with Castro for several months and became pregnant. When Marita discovered she was pregnant, there was little doubt who the father was. In October 1959, at seven months along, Marita says she was given a glass of drugged milk and blacked out. When she woke up in a local doctor’s office, the baby was nowhere to be found. Various stories have been floated over the years about what happened next, but none have been definitively confirmed: Either the fetus was aborted, Marita suffered a miscarriage, or she gave birth to a healthy baby boy named Andre.\n\nShe left the island and joined anti-Castro activists in Florida. Her later testimony named Francisco Fiorini as the CIA agent who recruited her to assassinate Castro, and that this was an alias for Frank Fiorini Sturgis. She received poison pills that she was to put in Castro's food. Back in Cuba in 1960, she did not deliver the pills but told Castro about the plot, claiming that she still loved him. She left the island and visited Castro one last time in 1981.\n\nAccording to Lorenz, in March 1961 she met deposed Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez, introduced to her as \"General Diaz\", at a residence in Miami Beach, Florida while working as a courier for the International Anti-Communist Brigade. She said she was to collect a $200,000 contribution from Pérez Jiménez for her group. Lorenz said: \"He chased me around for six weeks.\"\n\nLorenz claimed that Castro and Pérez Jiménez each fathered a child with her.\n\nIn August 1963, a paternity suit Lorenz filed against Pérez Jiménez briefly held up his extradition to Venezuela.\n\nIn 1977, Lorenz told Paul Meskil of the \"New York Daily News\" that she met Oswald in the fall of 1963 at an Operation 40 safe house in the Little Havana section of Miami. According to Lorenz, she met him again before the Kennedy assassination in 1963 in the house of Orlando Bosch, with Frank Sturgis, Pedro Luis Díaz Lanz, and two other Cubans present. She said the men studied Dallas street maps and that she suspected that they were planning on raiding an arsenal. Lorenz stated that she joined the men traveling to Dallas in two cars and carrying \"rifles and scopes\", but flew back to Miami the day after they arrived. In response to her allegations, Sturgis said he did not recall ever meeting Oswald and reiterated his previous denials of being involved in a conspiracy to kill Kennedy. In an interview with Steve Dunleavy of the \"New York Post\", he said that he believed communist agents had pressured Lorenz into making the accusations against him.\n\nLorenz testified about this Kennedy assassination plot before the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA). Her testimony was investigated by the political committee and said to be unreliable.\n\nIn February 1985, attorney Mark Lane read a deposition that Lorenz provided in E. Howard Hunt's libel suit against the Liberty Lobby's tabloid, \"The Spotlight\". Lorenz lived in New York City at the time, however, Lane read the deposition in court stating that Lorenz was \"afraid to come to Miami\". The deposition reiterated allegations similar to those she provided to the HSCA. Lorenz said she met Oswald in Miami in the early 1960s, and that in November 1963 Sturgis asked her to come to Dallas with him and Oswald to act as a decoy. Her statement said that she, Oswald, and seven anti-Castro Cubans transported weapons to Dallas in two cars shortly before November 22, 1963. Lorenz claimed that Hunt came to their Dallas motel room and provided Sturgis with an envelope filled with cash. According to one account, this testimony became the \"centerpiece\" for Lane's 1991 book \"Plausible Denial\".\n\nIn 1993, Lorenz was interviewed by \"Vanity Fair writer\" Ann Louise Bardach who described her as \"a patron saint of conspiracy buffs\". Bardach wrote \"at least half of her story is readily documented by the accounts of others and FBI memorandum, the other half lacks any corroboration, at times, flies in the face of existing evidence.\"\n\nIn 1970 she married the manager of an apartment building in New York. The two worked for the FBI spying on Eastern Bloc UN diplomats living in the building.\n\nWith Ted Schwarz, Lorenz's first autobiography, \"Marita: One Woman's Extraordinary Tale of Love and Espionage from Castro to Kennedy\", was published in 1993 by Thunder's Mouth Press. \"Kirkus Reviews\" described the book as \"the wild—if nearly incredible—adventures of a new Jane Bond\". \"Publishers Weekly\" wrote: \"Like other sensational conspiracy stories, this one presses the limits of credibility, but its very outrageousness gives it weight.\" Her second autobiography \"Lieber Fidel – Mein Leben, meine Liebe, mein Verrat\" () appeared in 2001.\n\nLorenz's story was the inspiration for the Jack Bender's 1999 TV film \"My Little Assassin\". Gabrielle Anwar portrayed Lorenz in the film and her mother Alice was portrayed by Jill Clayburgh. She is also the subject of a 2000 German documentary film \"Lieber Fidel - Maritas Geschichte\" (\"Dear Fidel - Marita's Story\").\n\nShe will be played by Jennifer Lawrence in the upcoming biographical film \"Marita\".\n\nLorenz lived in Jackson Heights, Queens. As of 2015, she lived in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nMonica Mercedes Pérez Jiménez, the daughter she claims to have had with Pérez Jiménez, is married to one of the sons of Orlando Letelier.\n\n"}

It is usually attributable to environmental phenomena such as heat waves, cold spells, epidemics and pandemics, especially influenza pandemics, famine or war.\n\nDuring heat waves, for instance, there are often additional deaths observed in the population, affecting especially older adults and those who are sick. After some periods with excess mortality, however, there has also been observed a decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks. Such short-term forward shift in mortality rate is also referred to as harvesting effect. The subsequent, compensatory reduction in mortality suggests that the heat wave had affected especially those whose health is already so compromised that they \"would have died in the short term anyway\".\n\nDeath marches can also lead to a significant mortality displacement, such as in the Trail of Tears, the Armenian Genocide, and the Bataan death march, wherein the oldest, weakest, and sickest died first.\n"}

Matthew, Jr., the prime suspect in the murder of Hannah Graham, a UVA student who is believed to have been abducted on September 13, 2014. On September 15, 2015, Jesse Matthew was formally charged with first-degree murder and abduction with intent to defile in the murder of Morgan Harrington. On March 2, 2016, Matthew pleaded guilty to the abduction and murder of both Graham and Harrington, receiving four consecutive life sentences with no possibility of parole.\n\nOn October 17, 2009, Harrington and three friends drove to the John Paul Jones Arena at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville for a Metallica concert. During the opening act's performance, Harrington told friends that she was going to the restroom. When she did not return, they called her cell phone at 8:48pm and she told them that she was locked out of the arena because of its \"no re-entry\" policy, adding that she would find a way home and they should not worry. According to witness reports, she was last seen at around 9:30pm hitchhiking on a nearby bridge. There were also two witnesses who claimed to have seen her with three men after she had left the arena.\nHarrington's purse, containing her identification and cell phone (with batteries removed), was discovered in the RV lot at UVA's Lannigan Athletic Field following her disappearance. Her remains were discovered by a farmer on January 26, 2010, about from the arena, in a remote area of the Ancorage Farm more than one-and-a-half miles from road access. Although investigators did not release information about her death, her parents confirmed that it had been very violent and that bones were broken. Her mother Gil later confirmed that her daughter had been raped.\n\nIn April 2010, forensic tests confirmed that a Pantera T-shirt, which had been found in November 2009 outside of an apartment building about a mile-and-a-half from the arena, was indeed the shirt Harrington had been wearing on the night she went missing.\nPolice also determined a forensic link between Harrington's murder and an abduction and sexual assault in Fairfax in September 2005. They also believed that the killer was familiar with the area where Harrington's body was found.\n\nThe case achieved such widespread national attention that the Virginia General Assembly honored the murdered student with a special resolution.\n\nThe killing provoked fears, expressed by her parents in many meetings with media including national television broadcasts, that a serial killer might be living in Virginia. DNA was later tied to a September 2005 attempted abduction in Fairfax City.\n\nCrimestoppers offered a $100,000 reward, and the band playing on the night of Harrington's death, Metallica, added an additional $50,000 reward for information leading to a conviction.\n\nHer parents continued to appear at numerous special events, including the University of Virginia's annual \"Take Back the Night\" rally and urged UVA administrators to work toward a safer campus.\n\nIn September 2014, Harrington's case was linked to the murder of Hannah Graham in Charlottesville, Virginia, through \"forensic evidence\" pertaining to Jesse Matthew, the main suspect in the latter case. On October 20, 2014, Matthew was indicted in a 2005 abduction in Fairfax, Virginia. Over a decade earlier, Matthew had twice been accused of sexual assault at two separate Virginia colleges he attended as a student. He left each school immediately after each allegation. The reported assaults occurred within an 11-month period of each other, as Matthew moved from the evangelical Christian Liberty University in Lynchburg to the Christopher Newport University in Newport News. Police investigated each report, but in neither incident was a criminal case brought against him. On September 15, 2015, Jesse Matthew was formally charged with first-degree murder and abduction with intent to defile in the murder of Morgan Harrington. The trial date was originally set for October 17, 2016 and moved back to October 24, 2016 because October 17 is the anniversary of Harrington's disappearance.\n\nOn March 2, 2016, after Matthew pleaded guilty to the 2014 murder of Hannah Graham and the 2009 murder of Morgan Harrington, a judge sentenced him to four consecutive life sentences. Under the plea agreement terms, Matthew gives up his right to appeal and would not be eligible for geriatric release.\n\n"}

The National Convention effectively serves as the Party's internal Parliament, and is made up of its 800 highest-ranking Party Officers. \n\nThe composition and functions of the NCC have evolved since its establishment in 1867. It has previously had a major role in policy-making and the planning of Party Conferences. Today, its primary purposes are to take charge of internal Party affairs and representing the views of Party members. Most crucially, it elects five members each year to sit on the Conservative Party Board. \n\nThe NCC was first established as the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations. Its purpose was to oversee the running of the Party across the country, and plan Party Conferences. These functions remain largely the same today, and every year the President of the NCC continues to officially open the Party Conference.\n\nOver time, the NUCUA's membership became more clearly defined, and has broadly been the same since the Party's set of extensive internal reforms following their defeat in the 1945 General Election. In 1998, new Party leader William Hague carried out another extensive reform which led to the NUCUA's renaming as the National Conservative Convention. In recent years, the Convention's influence over the running of the Party and its campaigning methods has increased heavily. Any changes to the Constitution of the Conservative Party must be approved by a majority vote of the NCC, and it plays a pivotal role in the inception and implementation of Party reforms, such as the Conservative Party Review.\n\nThe NCC includes a mix of appointed, directly and indirectly elected Party Officers. When members of the public join the Party, they are attached to the Conservative Association of the constituency they reside in. Party members elect their local Association Chairmen who sit on the Convention, and other local officials. Each Chairman and one Deputy Chairman sit on an Area Council, typically covering one or two Counties and several local authorities and constituencies. These Councils annually elect the Party's senior volunteers; Area and Regional Officers. All senior volunteers (approximately 150 Area and 30 Regional Officers) sit on the Convention. In addition to this, the Conservative Women's Organisation and Conservative Future (including their predecessor organisations) each send 40 delegates to the NCC, though Conservative Future has not sent delegates since its dissolution. In 2014, 16 year old Isaac Duffy became the youngest ever member of the National Convention.\n\nThe NCC meets three times a year; at Conservative Party Conference, the Conservative Spring Forum, and for its own election meeting, usually held in the summer. The Convention Executive (elected annually by its members) consists of its Chairman, who serves for three years, three Vice-Presidents, who each serve for three years, and the President, who serves for one year. Generally speaking, after finishing their term, an outgoing Vice-President is elected as the President and Chairs that year's Party Conference. Officers typically run for election for the NCC's Executive only after several decades of experience in the Party. The Party Leader and Chairman attend Convention meetings and address its members. There are also regular meetings of Senior Volunteers (Area and Regional Officers) in between full Convention meetings.\n\n\n\n"}

Despite its provincial origins it attracted Italian musicians and composers, many of whom became permanent residents of Corfu and contributed to the local music scene. The theatre acted as a catalyst in this cultural interaction and gave impetus to the development of the Ionian School of Music. Corfiot composer Nikolaos Halikiopoulos Mantzaros was a beneficiary of the synergy between the Italian and Corfiot musical traditions.\n\nNobile Teatro di San Giacomo was named after a Catholic cathedral in Corfu. Established in 1693 as a gathering place of the Venetian nobility of Corfu it was converted into a theatre in 1720 and became the first modern theatre to be established in Greece. Initially the theatre staged theatrical plays but in 1733 an opera was performed there for the first time. The opera was A. Aurelli’s \"Gerone, tiranno di Siracusa\". The operas were continuously staged especially between 1771 and 1892 when the theatre was converted to a City Hall.\n\nThe musical tradition established by the theatre is especially important to the history of modern Greek music since it helped establish a Greek musical presence at a time when the Greek State did not even exist. The theatre staged the type of comic opera known as opera buffa which was less elaborate and therefore more economical than the full-fledged opera seria. San Giacomo's opera crews were mainly from southern Italy.\n\nThe opera house functioned during times of upheaval unabated as, for example, during the arrival of the French in 1797. In 1799, during the Russia-Ottoman siege, the theatre continued its performances even as the foreign opera troupe was unable to leave the island due to the blockade. The performance at such a challenging time was used as a means for propaganda and to raise the morale of the population.\n\nThe theatre attracted many Italian professional musicians who came to Corfu as teachers as well as composers and performers. This had the effect of generating an appreciation for music among the locals and this gradually led to the appearance of the first Corfiot music professionals who, in turn, became the first professional musicians of modern Greece. Corfiot Spyridon Xyndas, for example, wrote the Greek opera \"O ypopsifios\" (\"The Parliamentary Candidate\") which became the first opera composed on an exclusively Greek libretto and was performed at San Giacomo in 1867.\n\nThe oral tradition held that operatic performers who found success at the theater were distinguished with the accolade \"applaudito in Corfú\" (\"applauded in Corfu\") as a tribute to the discriminating musical taste of the island audience.\n\nThe theatre was replaced by the Municipal Theatre of Corfu in 1902. The Municipal Theatre and its historical archives, many of which belonged to Teatro di San Giacomo, were destroyed during a Luftwaffe bombing raid in 1943.\n"}

In many nations, especially in North America, economic growth continued and even accelerated during World War I as nations mobilized their economies to fight the war in Europe. After the war ended, the global economy began to decline. In the United States, 1918–1919 saw a modest economic retreat, but the second part of 1919 saw a mild recovery. A more severe recession hit the United States in 1920 and 1921, when the global economy fell very sharply.\n\nIn North America, the recession immediately following World War I was extremely brief, lasting for only seven months from August 1918 (even before the war had actually ended) to March 1919. A second, much more severe recession, sometimes labeled a depression, began in January 1920. Several indices of economic activity suggest the recession was moderately severe. The Axe-Houghton Index of Index of Trade and Industrial Activity declined by 14.1% in this recession (compared to a 31% decline in the Panic of 1907). The Babson index of physical volume of business activity declined by 28.6% in this recession (compared to a 2.3% decline in the 1921 recession and a 22.7% decline in the Panic of 1907).\n\nIn Germany, the economic recession and inflation was harder due to the imposition of the Treaty of Versailles. A period of hyperinflation severely devalued the Mark and nearly crippled the German economy.\nBritain initially enjoyed an economic boom between 1919–1920, as private capital pent-up over four years of war was invested into the economy. The shipbuilding industry was flooded with orders to replace lost shipping (7.9 million tons worth of merchant shipping stock was destroyed during the war). However, by 1921, the British transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy faltered, and a serious recession struck the economy between 1921–1922. With other major economies also mired in recession, the export-dependent economy of Britain was particularly hard-hit. Unemployment reached 17%, with overall exports at only half of their pre-war levels.\n\n"}
{"id": "3123021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3123021", "title": "Pro-war rhetoric", "text": "Pro-war rhetoric\n\nPro-war rhetoric is rhetoric or propaganda designed to convince its audience that war is necessary. The two main analytical approaches to pro-war rhetoric were founded by Ronald Reid, a Professor of Communication Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and Robert Ivie, a Professor of Rhetoric and Public Communication and Culture at Indiana University (Bloomington). Reid's framework originated from inductively studying propaganda. Ivie uses a deductive approach based on the work of Kenneth Burke, claiming that \"a people strongly committed to the ideal of peace, but simultaneously faced with the reality of war, must believe that the fault for any such disruption of their ideal lies with others\" (Ivie 279).\n\nAccording to Reid, pro-war rhetoric uses three appeals: territorial, ethnocentric, and optimistic..\n\nTerritorial appeals threaten the audience's \"sense of territoriality\" (Reid 260). The audience is more likely to support entering the war on the defensive rather than offensive side because of an actual or threatened invasion.\n\nEthnocentric appeals create a dichotomy between the audience and the enemy. Ethnocentrism should be evoked to a \"high level of emotional intensity\" in attempt to complete two goals: hate the \"inferior alien\" and depict threats to cultural values (Reid 267).\n\nThe most common method of evoking ethnocentric appeals come in the form of Barbarism vs. Gallantry (Reid 269). It depicts the enemy's cultural values with evil characteristics, and the audience's as angelic.\n\nThe optimistic appeal assures the audience that victory is inevitable should they enter into war.(Reid 282).\n\nAccording to Ivie, pro-war rhetoric identifies three topoi; force vs. freedom, irrational vs. rational, and aggression vs. defense.\n\nThis tactic portrays to the audience that they are entering war to provide freedom, and the opponent to force their values upon others (Ivie 284). This is accomplished by implying that the opponent is violent, while the audience's nation is willing to negotiate (Ivie 284).\n\nThis topos holds that the enemy is portrayed as irrational, responding \"more to animalistic drives than principles of law\" (Ivie 288). The enemy has an unenlightened intellect, not based on reason. Rhetors use this argument to prove that when an enemy such as this threatens the well-being of the world, even for a nation committed to neutrality and peace, war is the only choice (Ivie 289).\n\nThis idea portrays the enemy as the voluntary aggressor and the nation of the audience as the passive victims of aggression, only entering into war to ensure security (Ivie 290). \"While the savage has acted against order, the victim has been forced to respond in its defense\" (Ivie 290). Ivie describes the actions as either \"voluntary\" and \"initial\" or \"involuntary\" and \"defensive\" (Ivie 290). The purpose of this topos is to lay the blame on the enemy and justify reasons for the victimized nation to engage in action.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "49124863", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49124863", "title": "Ritualcide", "text": "Ritualcide\n\nRitualcide is the systematic destruction or alteration of traditional ritual practices and their sequencing. Rituals have a prescribed form, source, and sequence that include sacred objects, places, times and seasons, music, dance, texts, songs and words, and mediators (such as monks, spirit mediums, religious leaders, and traditional healers). Ritualcide is not necessarily linked to genocide, but \"genocidal priming\" may gain a handhold when regimes tamper with collective tradition and leave inhabitants vulnerable and/or susceptible to spirit-based harm and angst. Herein ancestral pathways for intimate connection are often disrupted.\n\nThe term \"ritualcide\" was coined by Peg LeVine in \"Love and Dread in Cambodia: Weddings, Births and Ritual Harm Under the Khmer Rouge,\" which emerged from an eight-year ethnographic study into \"Khmer Rouge weddings\" and Cambodian ritual history before, during and after Democratic Kampuchea. The definition was expanded in 2015 when LeVine continued research at the Shoah Foundation, Center for Advanced Genocide Research. In October, 2016, ritualcide was introduced at the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) in conjunction with Khmer Rouge activity between 1975 and 1979; when LeVine gave expert witness, she suggested it was a \"crime against culture\". She has shown how ritual loss complicates the aftermath of trauma for the living and the dead, and ruptures the cosmological order that binds ancestors. Also, without access to reliable, traditional ritual sources, collective fear and vulnerability increase for survivors. In genocide and Holocaust studies, ritual restoration holds relevance for recovery by survivors and ancestors, and their collective sense of protection and cultural continuity.\n"}
{"id": "56776524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56776524", "title": "SAFE13 study", "text": "SAFE13 study\n\nThe Survey of Academic Field Experiences study, also known as the SAFE13 study, was a survey conducted between February and May of 2013 in order to characterize experiences of scientists working at field sites as they relate to sexual harassment and sexual assault. It has had a significant impact on collective responses to sexual harassment and sexual assault in Western academic science.\n\nPublished in 2014 by a team of anthropologists, Kathryn B. H. Clancy, Robin G. Nelson, Julienne N. Rutherford and Katie Hinde, the SAFE13 study is the first empirical investigation into scientists' experiences of harassment during fieldwork. The researchers identify three key takeaways from their work. First, women scientists are targeted more often than men, and junior scientists are also more likely to be harassed relative to senior scientists. Second, women are more likely to be harassed by senior staff, while men are harassed by their peers. Third, the majority of field scientists do not know how to report harassment.\n\nThe study included responses from 666 field scientists (77.5% were women and 85.9% of participants identified as heterosexual). The survey was conducted in two waves. The first wave ran from February 21 to April 12, 2013, and captured responses from biological anthropologists. The second wave, running from April 13 to May 10, collected responses from scientists in other disciplines. A further 26 interviews were completed to explore more in-depth experiences of sexual harassment in a broad range of fieldwork sites. The respondents were asked about experiences had at any time during their career.\n\nThe survey was not designed to estimate the prevalence of sexual harassment or assault at field sites. It was conducted online and offered anonymity, suggesting a potential self-selection bias. Only two questions in the survey directly queried the behavior experienced by respondents:\n\nAn affirmative response to question 32 was counted as a report of sexual harassment, while an affirmative response to question 39 was counted as sexual assault, including rape.\n\nAlmost three-quarters of participants (72.4%) had directly observed or been told about inappropriate behaviour or sexual comments during fieldwork. Around two-thirds of participants (64%) had personally experienced sexual language in the field and 20% of participants had experienced unwanted sexual contact. The study presented these findings as reports of \"sexual harassment\" and \"sexual assault\" respectively, though respondents were not asked whether they had been sexually harassed or assaulted. Following conventions in this area of scholarship, the study counted all \"sexual remarks\" as sexual harassment and all \"unwanted sexual contact\" as sexual assault. \n\nThe majority of people who experienced sexual harassment and assault were students and postdoctoral candidates. Perpetrators vary according to their target's gender: women are more likely to be harassed by superiors (senior people who have authority over them), while men are more likely to be harassed by their peers. Few people were sexually harassed by local members of the public, and instead the harassment occurred between colleagues in the field.\n\nThe SAFE13 study identifies several areas of improvement in combating sexual harassment in the field. For example, only around one-third of field scientists (37.7%) recalled a code of conduct operating at their fieldwork site, and less than one-quarter remembered there being anti-harassment policies. Amongst respondents who had experienced sexual harassment or assault, only one-fifth of survivors (20% each of women and men) knew of an easy way to formally report this experience. Amongst the small minority of people who did report sexual harassment and assault, less than 20% were satisfied with the outcome. The study therefore contributes to a body of empirical studies showing workplace sexual harassment negatively impacts on personal safety and professional productivity. In particular, the study shines attention on the role of fieldwork site directors in establishing clear rules to discourage sexual harassment.\n\nIn 2017, the qualitative findings of SAFE13 were published. Authored by Nelson, Rutherford, Hinde and Clancy, the study focused on the experiences of 26 interviewees, who were mostly anthropologists or archaeologists (23 of 26 interviewees), women (23 of 26), and white (21 of 26). Some participants described incidents of sexual harassment in multiple fieldwork sites, so fifty-four field contexts are represented in their narratives. Twelve participants recalled working at field sites with clear anti-harassment rules (representing 18 fieldwork sites). These sites had training, explicit conversations, and senior researchers modelled proactive behaviour to redress sexual harassment. Actively enforced anti-harassment policies were associated with positive fieldwork experiences where scientists felt safe, valued and equal. These sites were categorised by the researchers as \"green\" contexts where best practice was enforced by senior members of the research team. As a result there were fewer negative experiences, and transgressions were acted upon by leaders.\n\nThe rest of the participants described ambiguity or lack of clarity about codes of conduct. Even if they had some rules, sexual harassment still took place because were no consequences. Ambiguity led to repercussions for scientists who resisted sexual coercion, such as being alienated from colleagues and being denied professional opportunities. Harassment and negative fieldwork experiences also led to negative letters of employment, strained workplace relationships, career stalling, being forced to move to another site, or leaving their careers. The hostility would be continued into the future in other contexts, such as at conferences. Some participants were discouraged or prevented from taking formal reporting action by administrators. The researchers call ambiguous sites \"yellow\" contexts because if there was a vague set of rules, they were not consistently applied. \"Red\" contexts are fieldwork sites where there is both an absence of rules and consequences. \n\nSAFE2 and SAFE13 are recognised as having led to concrete institutional and policy changes in academic science.\n\nPrior to its final publication, the evolving findings of the SAFE13 study received media coverage in 2013, with a focus on how sexual harassment creates a \"chilly climate\" in science. Public discussion of the evolving study's findings explored the negative impact of harassment on junior women researchers. Media articles focused on fear of professional retribution if scientists report sexual harassment. Other science publishers discussed the sense of powerless that both victims and bystanders face as harassment goes unpunished. \n\nAfter the final report was published, the study became widely cited as evidence that sexual harassment contributes to women leaving science careers. Professional scientific societies publicly responded that, beyond making principal researchers responsible for reporting sexual harassment, institutional responses were additionally required. \n\nThe SAFE13 study inspired women scientists in other fields to conduct similar surveys into sexual harassment. It also paved the way for larger institutional surveys on harassment by professional societies. The SAFE13 study is referenced in high-profile cases, to contextualise the institutional dynamics that enable harassment to continue over many years. The study has had a major impact on American astronomy and physics in particular, as these disciplines increasingly grapple with public incidents of harassment.\n\nIn 2016, USA Rep. Jackie Speier of California sponsored a bill to compel research institutions to report investigations of harassment as a condition of receiving federal grant money. She cited the SAFE13 study as one piece of evidence informing the bill. She also referred to SAFE13 in media interviews. In February 2018, the USA National Science Foundation (NSF) announced it would require institutions to report whenever a researcher who is funded by their grants has engaged in sexual harassment. The NSF also expects institutions they fund to provide a harassment-free workplace. The NSF Office of Diversity and Inclusion will additionally provide policies and resources to support this aim, and create an anonymous reporting system to receive direct reports of sexual harassment. The NSF is one of various science agencies under pressure by the USA Congress to counter sexual harassment. This represents a major cultural change in scientific science since the SAFE13 study first recommended a review of institutional responses to harassment.\n\nOn 27 February 2018, lead researcher of the SAFE13 study, Kathryn (Kate) Clancy, provided testimony to the Subcommittee on Research and Technology Hearing on sexual harassment in science. The hearing identified a need to redress sexual harassment in science as a way to boost opportunities in science. Clancy testified that creating a safe, harassment-free workplace culture was imperative to improving science.\n\nFive years after its preliminary findings were released, the SAFE13 study continues to be referenced in various media articles exploring how victims of sexual harassment are punished when they report harassment. SAFE13 has also been cited as an important resource in responding to the aftermath of the #MeToo movement in 2017, by providing systematic context of sexual harassment. \n\nSince 2013, scientists have consistently used the hashtag #SAFE13 in connection to other research on sexual harassment, as well as to discuss media reports and investigations on sexual harassment in science and academia, and to share personal experiences of harassment in academic science.\n"}
{"id": "100615", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100615", "title": "San Remo conference", "text": "San Remo conference\n\nThe San Remo conference was an international meeting of the post-World War I Allied Supreme Council as an outgrowth of the Paris Peace Conference, held at Villa Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, from 19 to 26 April 1920. Resolutions passed at this conference determined the allocation of Class \"A\" League of Nations mandates for the administration of former Ottoman three territories in the Middle East: Palestine, Syria and Mesopotamia. Whilst Syria and Mesopotamia were provisionally recognized as states, Palestine was not. \n\nThe boundaries of the three territories were left unspecified, to \"be determined by the Principal Allied Powers.\" Three months later, in July 1920, the French defeat of the Arab Kingdom of Syria state precipitated the British need to know 'what is the \"Syria\" for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?' and \"does it include Transjordania?\" – it subsequently decided to pursue a policy of associating Transjordan with the mandated area of Palestine without adding it to the area of the Jewish National Home – and the French proclaimed Greater Lebanon and other component states of its Syrian mandate on 31 August 1920. The boundaries were not finalized until four years later.\n\nIt was attended by the four Principal Allied Powers of World War I who were represented by the prime ministers of Britain (David Lloyd George), France (Alexandre Millerand), Italy (Francesco Nitti) and by Japan's Ambassador Keishirō Matsui.\n\nDuring the meetings of the Council of Four in 1919, British Prime Minister Lloyd George stated that the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence was the basis for the Sykes-Picot Agreement which proposed an independent Arab state or confederation of states. In July 1919 the parliament of Greater Syria had refused to acknowledge any right claimed by the French Government to any part of Syrian territory.\n\nOn 30 September 1918 supporters of the Arab Revolt in Damascus declared a government loyal to Sharif Hussein, who had been declared \"King of the Arabs\" by religious leaders and other notables in Mecca. On 6 January 1920 the then Prince Faisal initialed an agreement with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau which acknowledged \"the right of the Syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation\". A Pan-Syrian Congress, meeting in Damascus, had declared an independent state of Syria on 8 March 1920. The new state included Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and portions of northern Mesopotamia which had been set aside under the Sykes-Picot Agreement for an independent Arab state or confederation of states. Faisal was declared the head of state. At the same time Prince Zeid, Faisal's brother, was declared regent of Mesopotamia.\n\nThe San Remo conference was convened following Conference of London (1920) and the proclamation on 8 March 1920 by the Syrian National Congress of an independent Arab Kingdom of Syria. It was attended by the prime ministers of Great Britain, France, and Italy, and representatives of Japan, Greece, and Belgium.\n\nSeveral issues were addressed: a peace treaty with Turkey, League of Nation mandates in the Middle East, Germany's obligations under the Versailles Peace Treaty of 1919, and the Allies' position on Soviet Russia.\n\nGreat Britain and France agreed to recognize the provisional independence of Syria and Mesopotamia, while claiming mandates for their administration. Palestine was composed of the Ottoman administrative districts of southern Syria. Under international law, premature recognition of its independence would be a gross affront to the government of the newly declared parent state. It could have been construed as a belligerent act of intervention without any League of Nations sanction.\n\nFor France, the San Remo decision meant that most of its claims in Syria were internationally recognized and relations with Faisal were now subject to French military and economic considerations. The ability of Great Britain to limit French action was also significantly diminished. France issued an ultimatum and intervened militarily at the Battle of Maysalun in July 1920, deposing the Arab government and removing King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920. In 1920, Great Britain appointed Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel as high commissioner and established a mandatory government in Palestine that remained in power until 1948.\n\nArticle 22 of the League of Nations Covenant, which contained the general rules to be applied to all Mandated Territories, was written two months before the signing of the Versaille Peace Treaty. It was not known at that time to which territories paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 would relate. The territories which came under the regime set up by this article were three former parts of the Ottoman Empire and seven former overseas possessions of Germany referred to in Part IV, Section I, of the treaty of peace. Those 10 territorial areas were originally administered under 15 mandates.\n\nThe decisions of the San Remo conference confirmed the mandate allocations of the First Conference of London (February 1920). The San Remo Resolution adopted on 25 April 1920 incorporated the Balfour Declaration of 1917. It and Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations were the basic documents upon which the British Mandate for Palestine was constructed. Under the Balfour Declaration, the British government had undertaken to favour the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine without prejudice to the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country. Britain received the mandate for Palestine and Iraq; France gained control of Syria, including present-day Lebanon. Britain and France also signed the San Remo Oil Agreement, whereby Britain granted France a 25 percent share of the oil production from Mosul, with the remainder going to Britain and France undertook to deliver oil to the Mediterranean. The draft peace agreement with Turkey signed at the conference became the basis for the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres. Germany was called upon to carry out its military and reparation obligations under the Versailles Treaty, and a resolution was adopted in favor of restoring trade with Russia.\n\nAsserting that not all parts of the Middle East were ready for full independence, mandates were established for the government of three territories: Syria and Lebanon, Mesopotamia (Iraq) and Palestine. In each case, one of the Allied Powers was assigned to implement the mandate until the territories in question could \"stand alone.\"\n\nIn 2010, a panel discussion was held in San Remo on the subject of the conference's legal significance for the status of Israel and Jerusalem under international law. Panel participants included Deputy Speaker of the Knesset MK Danny Danon and Italian MP Fiamma Nirenstein.\n\nSan Remo Resolution – 25 April 1920\n\nIt was agreed –\n\n(a) To accept the terms of the Mandates Article as given below with reference to Palestine, on the understanding that there was inserted in the procès-verbal an undertaking by the Mandatory Power that this would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine; this undertaking not to refer to the question of the religious protectorate of France, which had been settled earlier in the previous afternoon by the undertaking given by the French Government that they recognized this protectorate as being at an end.\n\n(b) that the terms of the Mandates Article should be as follows:\n\nThe High Contracting Parties agree that Syria and Mesopotamia shall, in accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 22, Part I (Covenant of the League of Nations), be provisionally recognized as independent States, subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The boundaries of the said States will be determined, and the selection of the Mandatories made, by the Principal Allied Powers.\n\nThe High Contracting Parties agree to entrust, by application of the provisions of Article 22, the administration of Palestine, within such boundaries as may be determined by the Principal Allied Powers, to a Mandatory, to be selected by the said Powers. The Mandatory will be responsible for putting into effect the declaration originally made on the 8th [2nd] November, 1917, by the British Government, and adopted by the other Allied Powers, in favour of the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country.\n\n\"La Puissance mandataire s’engage à nommer dans le plus bref delai une Commission speciale pour etudier toute question et toute reclamation concernant les differentes communautes religieuses et en etablir le reglement. Il sera tenu compte dans la composition de cette Commission des interets religieux en jeu.

{"id": "44358671", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44358671", "title": "Sharphead band", "text": "Sharphead band\n\nThe Sharphead band was an indigenous people of what is now central Alberta, which was a part of the Stoney (Nakoda) ethno-linguistic group and was party to Treaty 6 (1876) with the Canadian Crown. The Sharphead were devastated by hunger and disease and ceased to exist as a separate people after 1897 when their reserve lands were taken by the Canadian government and the few remaining survivors were dispersed to live with other neighbouring First Nations.\n\nFollowing their entry into treaty, the Sharphead people continued to live a traditional nomadic lifestyle until 1885 when the Sharphead Indian Reserve No.141 was created within the District of Alberta, Northwest Territories (later the Province of Alberta) under the terms of the \"Indian Act\". As surveyed in October 1885, the reserve had an area of along the Battle River and Wolf Creek, and included a Methodist mission.\n\nAccording to Canadian colonial records, between 1886 and 1893 the band was devastated by smallpox, crop failures, and declining hunting. During that time, more than half of the population is estimated to have died, while the survivors dispersed and moved to other reserves. The band was deemed to be extinct by the federal government and the reserve land was surrendered in 1897 and divided into homesteads for Euro-Canadian settlers. Oral history among local peoples has circulated the idea that the Sharphead were deliberately killed by government officials via infected blankets or tainted meat in an act of \"genocide\", an accusation voiced in 2014 by Kurt Buffalo, a Sharphead descendant and chief of the nearby Samson Cree Nation. However, there is no historical evidence regarding this theory according to Roger Epp, vice-provost of academics at the University of Alberta. Historical records around the Sharphead are very sparse and it was not until the mid-1970s that researchers were able to trace Sharphead descendants to 15 neighbouring bands.\n\nThe movement towards securing a surrender of the land seems to have been initiated by Hayter Reed first as Indian Commissioner, then, after 1893, as Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. As well, outside pressure from Frank Oliver, a prominent Edmonton Liberal, publisher of the \"Edmonton Bulletin\" and future cabinet minister, seems to have played a part, according to a 1998 report by Peggy Martin-McGuire for the Indian Claims Commission.\n\nIn 1965 workers installing an electrical power line discovered human remains from 26 individuals at a cemetery site on the former reserve. The remains were taken by the University of Alberta's anthropology department for study until 1970 when they were put in storage because the then-owner of the land containing the burial site did not want them reinterred. In 2007 electrical workers discovered more remains on the same site which prompted the provincial government and 14 nearby bands to begin to search for a new burial site for the remains. In the summer of 2013 land was purchased by the provincial government near the town of Ponoka close to the Battle River. Ponoka County objected to the plan, however, and issued a stop order to the province in October 2014. Nevertheless, a re-interment ceremony was held in October 2014.\n"}
{"id": "8651870", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8651870", "title": "Soap made from human corpses", "text": "Soap made from human corpses\n\nDuring the 20th century, there were various alleged instances of soap being made from human body fat. During World War I it was claimed in the British press that the Germans had a corpse factory in which they used the bodies of their own soldiers to make glycerine and soap. During World War II it was believed that soap was being mass-produced from the bodies of the victims of Nazi concentration camps located in German-occupied Poland. During Nuremberg trials evidence was presented that German researchers had developed a process for the production of soap from human bodies. The Yad Vashem Memorial has stated that the Nazis did not produce soap from Jewish corpses on an industrial scale, saying that rumors that soap from human corpses was mass-produced and distributed were deliberately used by the Nazis to frighten camp inmates. It is now known that Nazi Germany did produce soap from human corpses, but not on industrial scale.\n\nIn 1780, the former Holy Innocents' Cemetery in Paris was closed because of overuse. In 1786, the bodies were exhumed and the bones were moved to the Catacombs. Many bodies had incompletely decomposed and had reduced into deposits of fat. During the exhumation, this fat was collected and subsequently turned into candles and soap.\n\nThe claim that Germans used the fat from human corpses to make products, including soap, was made during World War I. This appears to have originated as rumor among British soldiers and Belgians. The first recorded reference is in 1915 when Cynthia Asquith noted in her diary (16 June 1915): \"We discussed the rumour that the Germans utilise even their corpses by converting them into glycerine with the by-product of soap.\" It became a major international story when \"The Times\" of London reported in April 1917 that the Germans had admitted rendering the bodies of their dead soldiers for fat to make soap and other products.\n\nAfter the war John Charteris, the former head of army intelligence, was reported to have claimed in a 1925 speech that he had invented the story. He subsequently insisted that his remarks had been misreported. The controversy led the British Foreign Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to officially state that the government accepted that the \"corpse factory\" story was untrue. The belief that the British had deliberately invented the story was later used by the Nazis.\n\nRumours that the Nazis produced soap from the bodies of concentration camp inmates circulated widely during the war. Germany suffered a shortage of fats during World War II, and the production of soap was put under government control. The \"human soap\" rumours may have originated from the bars of soap being marked with the initials RIF, which was interpreted by some as ' (\"State Jewish Fat\"); in German Blackletter font the difference between I and J is only in length. RIF in fact stood for ' (\"National Center for Industrial Fat Provisioning\", the German government agency responsible for wartime production and distribution of soap and washing products). RIF soap was a poor quality substitute product that contained no fat at all, human or otherwise. Rumors about the origins and meaning of \"RIF\" soap extended into the concentration camps themselves. Naphtali Karchmer, in his book \"Solitary in the Overwhelming Turbulence: Five Years as Prisoner-of-War in East Prussia\", describes his years in captivity as a Jewish-Polish POW. The author writes about gray, rectangular, low-quality pieces of soap he and other POWs received with the letters \"RIF\" inscribed on a center depression. When one of the POWs complained about the low-foam, smooth soap, the lady of the household answered it was made of \"\" (pure Jewish fat), when asked \"out of human fat?\", she answered \"No, just Jews\". A version of the story is included in \"The Complete Black Book of Russian Jewry\", one of the earliest collections of firsthand accounts of the Holocaust, assembled by Soviet writers Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman. The specific story is part of a report titled \"The Extermination of the Jews of Lvov\" attributed to I. Herts and Naftali Nakht:\n\nRaul Hilberg reports such stories as circulating in Lublin as early as October 1942. The Germans themselves were aware of the stories, as SS-chief had received a letter describing the Polish belief that Jews were being \"boiled into soap\" and which indicated that the Poles feared they would suffer a similar fate. Indeed, the rumours circulated so widely that some segments of the Polish population actually boycotted the purchase of soap.\n\n, in a German paper presented at the 28th conference of the German Studies Association, cites the following comment by Himmler from a letter of November 20, 1942 to the head of the , . Himmler had written to Müller due to an exposé by Rabbi Dr. Stephen Wise, which mentioned the soap rumor and had been printed in \"The New York Times\":\n\nMüller was to make inquiries if \"abuse\" had happened somewhere and report this to Himmler \"on SS oath\"; Himmler hence did not from the outset exclude the possibility that such had taken place. Neander goes on to state that the letter represents circumstantial evidence that it was Nazi policy to abstain from processing corpses due to their known desire to keep their mass murder as secret as possible.\n\nDuring the Nuremberg Trials, Sigmund Mazur, a laboratory assistant at the Danzig Anatomical Institute (modern ), testified that soap had been made from corpse fat at the camp, and claimed that 70 to 80 kg (155–175 lb) of fat collected from 40 bodies could produce more than of soap, and that the finished soap was retained by Professor Rudolf Spanner. Eyewitnesses included British POWs who were part of the forced labor that constructed the camp, and Dr , head of the Department of Toxicology at the School of Medicine. Holocaust survivor Thomas Blatt, who investigated the subject, found little concrete documentation and no evidence of mass production of soap from human fat, but concluded that there was evidence of experimental soap making.\n\nTestimony was given both by Nazis and by British prisoners of war about the development of an industrial process for producing soap from human bodies, the production of such soap on a small-scale basis, and the actual use of this soap by Nazi personnel at the Danzig Anatomic Institute.\n\nIn his book \"Russia at War 1941 to 1945\", Alexander Werth reported that while visiting /Danzig in 1945 shortly after its conquest by the Red Army, he saw an experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human corpses. According to Werth it had been run by \"a German professor called Spanner\" and \"was a nightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsos pickled in some liquid, and its pails full of a flakey substance—human soap\".\n\nIn the Independent State of Croatia, a World War II puppet state of Nazi Germany and Italy established in part of Axis-occupied Yugoslavia, in the Jasenovac concentration camp a small factory for converting human remains into soap was also established by members of the Ustasha movement. Parts of the \"soap factory\" still exist and can be seen in memorial zone \"Donja Gradina\".\n\nThe idea that \"human soap\" was manufactured on an industrial scale by the Nazis was first published after the war in 1946 by in her seminal Medallions (see Rudolf Spanner). It was not refuted for dozens of years in Polish official historiography.\n\nAlain Resnais, who treated the testimony of Holocaust survivors as fact, continued the accusation in his noted 1955 Holocaust documentary film '. Some postwar Israelis — in the army, schools, etc. — also referred disdainfully to Jewish victims of Nazism arrived to Israel with the Hebrew word (', \"soap\"). In fact, this offensive word was not linked to the rumors about the Nazi crimes and the human soap, but had the sense of \"soft\", \"weaklings\".\n\nThough evidence does exist of small-scale soap production, possibly experimental, in the camp at Stutthof concentration camp near Danzig/Gdansk, mainstream scholars of the Holocaust consider the idea that the Nazis manufactured soap on an industrial scale to be part of World War II folklore. Historian Israel Gutman has stated that \"it was never done on a mass scale\". In \"Hitler's Death Camps: The Sanity of Madness\" Konnilyn Feig concludes that the Nazis \"did indeed use human fat for the making of soap at Stutthof\", albeit in limited quantity. Holocaust historian Robert Melvin Spector writes that \"her analysis seems sound, given the known fact that the S.S. used everything it could obtain from its prisoners\", including hair, skin and bones.\n\nIn 2006 a sample of the soap archived at the International Court of Justice in The Hague was given for analysis to , an expert in the chemistry of fats from the Gdansk University of Technology in Poland. He concluded that some of the fat in the sample tested was of human origin. The sample of soap had previously been used as evidence in the post-World War II Nuremberg trials, but at the time the technology was unavailable to determine whether the soap had been produced from human fat. The human remains used to make the soap were believed to have been brought from and Stutthof concentration camp.\n\nToday Holocaust deniers employ this controversy to criticize the veracity of the Nazi genocide.\n\nIn the wake of the second world war, Rabbi David Polish wrote a poem, speaking of the Jewish soap:\n\nThe BBC documentary about the death camps found during the end of the war shows similar atrocities including shrunken prisoner heads and preserved tattoos, recorded at a display in Buchenwald before the German people from Weimar after the camp's liberation.\n\nSeveral burial sites in Israel include graves for \"soap made of Jewish victims by the Nazis\". These are probably bars of RIF soap. Following a heated discussion on the media about these graves in 2003, Yad Vashem publicized Professor Yehuda Bauer's research saying that RIF soap was not made of human fat, and that the RIF myth was probably propagated by the Nazi guards to taunt the Jews. Yad Vashem includes an image of an emotional funeral and burial of \"Jewish\" soap in Romania.\n\nA small bar of soap was on display at the Nazareth holocaust memorial museum in Israel, and a similar bar of soap was buried in the \"holocaust cellar\" live-museum in mount Zion in Jerusalem, Israel, during the museum's inception in 1958. A replica was on display there. Following Professor Yehuda Bauer of Yad Vashem publicizing his conclusion that soap was not made in industrial quantities from the bodies of Jews or other Nazi camp inmates, Tom Segev, a \"new historian\" and anti-establishment Israeli author, wrote in his book \"The Seventh Million\" about the Holocaust-Cellar soap that it was \"idol worshiping in Jerusalem\".\n\n\n"}

The audience typically submits titles of songs that have never been written, and the performers choose suggestions to create songs, the audience votes through acclamation on their favorite song, which is then used as the core of a brand new Broadway musical.\n\nThe format received a favorable review from The \"New York Times\" when it premiered in New York in 1995.\n\nThough not required or necessarily encouraged by improv professionals, elements of humor inevitably surface in the performance because of the surprising and playful nature of improvisation and its use of typical Broadway stereotypes. The performers' songs are supported by an onstage musician or band that improvises the music, generally in the style of typical show tunes.\n\nThe format was created in New York City at Freestyle Repertory Theatre and has been performed by a number of different companies around the US. Currently, it is performed by BATS theatre in San Francisco, The Mop & Bucket Co. in Schenectady NY, and at several colleges around the country, including Stanford. \n\nThe Spontaneous Broadway format was created by Kat Koppett in association with Freestyle Repertory Theatre in New York.

{"id": "25272420", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25272420", "title": "Stalking", "text": "Stalking\n\nStalking is unwanted or repeated surveillance by an individual or group towards another person. Stalking behaviors are interrelated to harassment and intimidation and may include following the victim in person or monitoring them. The term \"stalking\" is used with some differing definitions in psychiatry and psychology, as well as in some legal jurisdictions as a term for a criminal offense.\n\nAccording to a 2002 report by the U.S. National Center for Victims of Crime, \"virtually any unwanted contact between two people that directly or indirectly communicates a threat or places the victim in fear can be considered stalking\", although in practice the legal standard is usually somewhat stricter.\n\nThe difficulties associated with defining this term exactly (or defining it at all) are well documented.\n\nHaving been used since at least the 16th century to refer to a prowler or a poacher (\"Oxford English Dictionary\"), the term \"stalker\" was initially used by media in the 20th century to describe people who pester and harass others, initially with specific reference to the harassment of celebrities by strangers who were described as being \"obsessed\". This use of the word appears to have been coined by the tabloid press in the United States. With time, the meaning of stalking changed and incorporated individuals being harassed by their former partners. Pathé and Mullen describe stalking as \"a constellation of behaviours in which an individual inflicts upon another repeated unwanted intrusions and communications\". Stalking can be defined as the willful and repeated following, watching and/or harassing of another person. Unlike other crimes, which usually involve one act, stalking is a \"series\" of actions that occur over a period of time.\n\nAlthough stalking is illegal in most areas of the world, some of the actions that contribute to stalking may be legal, such as gathering information, calling someone on the phone, texting, sending gifts, emailing, or instant messaging. They become illegal when they breach the legal definition of harassment (e.g., an action such as sending a text is not usually illegal, but is illegal when frequently repeated to an unwilling recipient). In fact, United Kingdom law states the incident only has to happen twice when the harasser should be aware their behavior is unacceptable (e.g., two phone calls to a stranger, two gifts, following the victim then phoning them, etc).\n\nCultural norms and meaning effect the way stalking is defined. Scholars note that the majority of men and women admit engaging in various stalking-like behaviors following a breakup, but stop such behaviors over time, suggesting that \"engagement in low levels of unwanted pursuit behaviors for a relatively short amount of time, particularly in the context of a relationship break-up, may be normative for heterosexual dating relationships occurring within U.S. culture.\"\n\nThe Violence Against Women Act of 2005, amending a United States statute, 108 Stat. 1902 et seq, defined stalking as \"engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to—\n\nPeople characterized as stalkers may be accused of having a mistaken belief that another person loves them (erotomania), or that they need rescuing. Stalking can consist of an accumulation of a series of actions which, by themselves, can be legal, such as calling on the phone, sending gifts, or sending emails.\n\nStalkers may use overt and covert intimidation, threats and violence to frighten their victims. They may engage in vandalism and property damage or make physical attacks that are meant to frighten. Less common are sexual assaults.\n\nIntimate partner stalkers are the most dangerous type. In the UK, for example, most stalkers are former partners and evidence indicates that mental illness-facilitated stalking propagated in the media accounts for only a minority of cases of alleged stalking. A UK Home Office research study on the use of the Protection from Harassment Act stated: \"The study found that the Protection from Harassment Act is being used to deal with a variety of behaviour such as domestic and inter-neighbour disputes. It is rarely used for stalking as portrayed by the media since only a small minority of cases in the survey involved such behaviour.\"\n\nDisruptions in daily life necessary to escape the stalker, including changes in employment, residence and phone numbers, take a toll on the victim's well-being and may lead to a sense of isolation.\n\nAccording to Lamber Royakkers:\n\n\"Stalking is a form of mental assault, in which the perpetrator repeatedly, unwantedly, and disruptively breaks into the life-world of the victim, with whom they have no relationship (or no longer have). Moreover, the separated acts that make up the intrusion cannot by themselves cause the mental abuse, but do taken together (cumulative effect).\"\n\nStalking has also been described as a form of close relationship between the parties, albeit a disjunctive one where the two participants have opposing goals rather than cooperative goals. One participant, often a woman, likely wishes to end the relationship entirely, but may find herself unable to easily do so. The other participant, often but not always a man, wishes to escalate the relationship. It has been described as a close relationship because the duration, frequency, and intensity of contact may rival that of a more traditional conjunctive dating relationship.\n\nBased on work with stalking victims for eight years in Australia, Mullen and Pathé identified different types of stalking victims dependent on their previous relationship to the stalker. These are:\n\nAccording to one study, women often target other women, whereas men primarily stalk women. A January 2009 report from the United States Department of Justice reports that \"Males were as likely to report being stalked by a male as a female offender. 43% of male stalking victims stated that the offender was female, while 41% of male victims stated that the offender was another male. Female victims of stalking were significantly more likely to be stalked by a male (67%) rather than a female (24%) offender.\" This report provides considerable data by gender and race about both stalking and harassment, obtained via the 2006 Supplemental Victimization Survey (SVS), by the U.S. Census Bureau for the U.S. Department of Justice. In an article by Jennifer Langhinrichsen-Rohling she discusses how gender plays a role in the difference between stalkers and victims. She says, \"gender is associated with the types of emotional reactions that are experienced by recipients of stalking related events, including the degree of fear experienced by the victim.\" In addition, she hypothesizes that gender may also effect how police handle a case of stalking, how the victim copes with the situation, and how the stalker might view their behavior. She discusses how victims might view certain forms of stalking as normal because of gender socialization influences on the acceptability of certain behaviors. She emphasizes that in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States, strangers are considered more dangerous when it comes to stalking than a former partner. Media also plays an important role due to portrayals of male stalking behavior as acceptable, influencing men into thinking it is normal. Since gender roles are socially constructed, sometimes men don't report stalking. She also mentions coercive control theory, \"future research will be needed to determine if this theory can predict how changes in social structures and gender-specific norms will result in variations in rates of stalking for men versus women over time in the United States and across the world.\"\n\nPsychologists often group individuals who stalk into two categories: psychotic and nonpsychotic. Some stalkers may have pre-existing psychotic disorders such as delusional disorder, schizoaffective disorder, or schizophrenia. However, most stalkers are nonpsychotic and may exhibit disorders or neuroses such as major depression, adjustment disorder, or substance dependence, as well as a variety of personality disorders (such as antisocial, borderline, or narcissistic). The nonpsychotic stalkers' pursuit of victims is primarily angry, vindictive, focused, often including projection of blame, obsession, dependency, minimization, denial, and jealousy. Conversely, only 10% of stalkers had an erotomanic delusional disorder.\n\nIn \"A Study of Stalkers\" Mullen \"et al\". (2000) identified five types of stalkers:\nIn addition to Mullen et al., Joseph A. Davis, Ph.D., an American researcher, crime analyst, and university psychology professor at San Diego State University investigated, as a member of the Stalking Case Assessment Team (SCAT), special unit within the San Diego District Attorney's Office, hundreds of cases involving what he called and typed \"terrestrial\" and \"cyberstalking\" between 1995 and 2002. This research culminated in one of the most comprehensive books written to date on the subject. It is considered the \"gold standard\" as a reference to stalking crimes, victim protection, safety planning, security and threat assessment published by CRC Press, Inc., in August, 2001.\n\nThe 2002 National Victim Association Academy defines an additional form of stalking: The vengeance/terrorist stalker. Both the vengeance stalker and terrorist stalker (the latter sometimes called the political stalker) do not, in contrast with some of the aforementioned types of stalkers, seek a personal relationship with their victims but rather force them to emit a certain response. While the vengeance stalker's motive is \"to get even\" with the other person whom he/she perceives has done some wrong to them (e.g., an employee who believes is fired without justification from their job by their superior), the political stalker intends to accomplish a political agenda, also using threats and intimidation to force his/her target to refrain and/or become involved in some particular activity, regardless of the victim's consent. For example, most prosecutions in this stalking category have been against anti-abortionists who stalk doctors in an attempt to discourage the performance of abortions.\n\nStalkers may fit categories with paranoia disorders. Intimacy-seeking stalkers often have delusional disorders involving erotomanic delusions. With rejected stalkers, the continual clinging to a relationship of an inadequate or dependent person couples with the entitlement of the narcissistic personality, and the persistent jealousy of the paranoid personality. In contrast, resentful stalkers demonstrate an almost \"pure culture of persecution\", with delusional disorders of the paranoid type, paranoid personalities, and paranoid schizophrenia.\n\nOne of the uncertainties in understanding the origins of stalking is that the concept is now widely understood in terms of specific behaviors which are found to be offensive and/or illegal. As discussed above, these specific (apparently stalking) behaviors may have multiple motivations.\n\nIn addition, the personality characteristics that are often discussed as antecedent to stalking may also produce behavior that is not stalking as conventionally defined. Some research suggests there is a spectrum of what might be called \"obsessed following behavior.\" People who complain obsessively and for years, about a perceived wrong or wrong-doer, when no one else can perceive the injury—and people who cannot or will not \"let go\" of a person or a place or an idea—comprise a wider group of persons that may be problematic in ways that seem similar to stalking. Some of these people get extruded from their organizations—they may get hospitalized or fired or let go if their behavior is defined in terms of illegal stalking, but many others do good or even excellent work in their organizations and appear to have just one focus of tenacious obsession.\n\nCyberstalking is the use of computers or other electronic technology to facilitate stalking. In Davis (2001), Lucks identified a separate category of stalkers who instead of a terrestrial means, prefer to perpetrate crimes against their targeted victims through electronic and online means. Amongst college students, Ménard and Pincus found that men who had a high score of sexual abuse as children and narcissistic vulnerability were more likely to become stalkers. Out of the women who participated in their study, 9% were cyberstalkers meanwhile only 4% were overt stalkers. In addition, the male participants revealed the opposite, 16% were overt stalkers while 11% were cyberstalkers. Alcohol and physical abuse both played a role in predicting women's cyberstalking and in men, \"preoccupied attachment significantly predicted cyber stalking\".\n\nAccording to a U.S. Department of Justice special report a significant number of people reporting stalking incidents claim that they had been stalked by more than one person, with 18.2% reporting that they were stalked by two people, 13.1% reporting that they had been stalked by three or more. The report did not break down these cases into numbers of victims who claimed to have been stalked by several people individually, and by people acting in concert. A question asked of respondents reporting three or more stalkers by polling personnel about whether the stalking was related to co-workers, members of a gang, fraternities, sororities, etc., did not have its responses indicated in the survey results as released by the DOJ. The data for this report was obtained via the 2006 Supplemental Victimization Survey (SVS), conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Department of Justice.\n\nAccording to a United Kingdom study by Sheridan and Boon, in 5% of the cases they studied there was more than one stalker, and 40% of the victims said that friends or family of their stalker had also been involved. In 15% of cases, the victim was unaware of any reason for the harassment.\n\nOver a quarter of all stalking and harassment victims do not know their stalkers in any capacity. About a tenth responding to the SVS did not know the identities of their stalkers. 11% of victims said they had been stalked for five years or more.\n\nIn 1999, Pathe, Mullen and Purcell wrote that popular interest in stalking was promoting false claims. In 2004, Sheridan and Blaauw said that they estimated that 11.5% of claims in a sample of 357 reported claims of stalking were false.\n\nAccording to Sheridan and Blaauw, 70% of false stalking reports were made by people suffering from delusions, stating that \"after eight uncertain cases were excluded, the false reporting rate was judged to be 11.5%, with the majority of false victims suffering delusions (70%).\" Another study estimated the proportion of false reports that were due to delusions as 64%.\n\nNews reports have described how groups of Internet users have cooperated to exchange detailed conspiracy theories involving coordinated activities by large numbers of people called \"gang stalking\". The activities involved are described as involving electronic harassment, the use of \"psychotronic weapons\", and other alleged mind control techniques. These have been reported by external observers as being examples of belief systems, as opposed to reports of objective phenomena. Some psychiatrists and psychologists say \"Web sites that amplify reports of mind control and group stalking\" are \"an extreme community that may encourage delusional thinking\" and represent \"a dark side of social networking. They may reinforce the troubled thinking of the mentally ill and impede treatment.\"\n\nA study from Australia and the United Kingdom by Lorraine Sheridan and David James compared 128 self-defined victims of 'gang-stalking' with a randomly selected group of 128 self-declared victims of stalking by an individual. All 128 'victims' of gang-stalking were judged to be delusional, compared with only 3.9% of victims of individual-stalking. There were highly significant differences between the two samples on depressive symptoms, post-traumatic symptomatology and adverse impact on social and occupational function, with the self-declared victims of gang-stalking more severely affected. The authors concluded that \"group-stalking appears to be delusional in basis, but complainants suffer marked psychological and practical sequelae. This is important in the assessment of risk in stalking cases, early referral to psychiatric services and allocation of police resources.\"\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Purcell, Pathé and Mullen (2002), 23% of the Australian population reported having been stalked.\n\nStieger, Burger and Schild conducted a survey in Austria, revealing a lifetime prevalence of 11% (women: 17%, men: 3%).\nFurther results include: 86% of stalking victims were female, 81% of the stalkers were male. Women were mainly stalked by men (88%) while men were almost equally stalked by men and women (60% male stalkers). 19% of the stalking victims reported that they were still being stalked at the time of study participation (point prevalence rate: 2%). To 70% of the victims, the stalker was known, being a prior intimate partner in 40%, a friend or acquaintance in 23% and a colleague at work in 13% of cases. As a consequence, 72% of the victims reported having changed their lifestyle. 52% of former and ongoing stalking victims reported suffering from a currently impaired (pathological) psychological well-being. There was no significant difference between the incidence of stalking in rural and urban areas.\n\nIn 1998 Budd and Mattinson found a lifetime prevalence of 12% in England and Wales (16% female, 7% males).\nIn 2010/11 43% of stalking victims were found to be male and 57% female.\n\nAccording to a paper by staff from the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre, a unit established to deal with people with fixations on public figures, 86% of a sample group of 100 people assessed by them appeared to them to suffer from psychotic illness; 57% of the sample group were subsequently admitted to hospital, and 26% treated in the community.\n\nA similar retrospective study published in 2009 in \"Psychological Medicine\" based on a sample of threats to the Royal Family kept by the Metropolitan Police Service over a period of 15 years, suggested that 83.6% of the writers of these letters suffered from serious mental illness.\n\nDressing, Kuehner and Gass conducted a representative survey in Mannheim, a middle-sized German city, and reported a lifetime prevalence of having been stalked of almost 12%.\n\nTjaden and Thoennes reported a lifetime prevalence (being stalked) of 8% in females and 2% in males (depending on how strict the definition) in the National Violence Against Women Survey.\n\nEvery Australian state enacted laws prohibiting stalking during the 1990s, with Queensland being the first state to do so in 1994. The laws vary slightly from state to state, with Queensland's laws having the broadest scope, and South Australian laws the most restrictive. Punishments vary from a maximum of 10 years imprisonment in some states, to a fine for the lowest severity of stalking in others. Australian anti-stalking laws have some notable features. Unlike many US jurisdictions they do not require the victim to have felt fear or distress as a result of the behaviour, only that a reasonable person would have felt this way. In some states, the anti-stalking laws operate extra-territorially, meaning that an individual can be charged with stalking if either they or the victim are in the relevant state. Most Australian states provide the option of a restraining order in cases of stalking, breach of which is punishable as a criminal offence. There has been relatively little research into Australian court outcomes in stalking cases, although Freckelton (2001) found that in the state of Victoria, most stalkers received fines or community based dispositions.\n\nSection 264 of the Criminal Code, titled \"criminal harassment\", addresses acts which are termed \"stalking\" in many other jurisdictions. The provisions of the section came into force in August 1993 with the intent of further strengthening laws protecting women. It is a hybrid offence, which may be punishable upon summary conviction or as an indictable offence, the latter of which may carry a prison term of up to ten years. Section 264 has withstood Charter challenges.\n\nThe Chief, Policing Services Program, for Statistics Canada has stated:\n\n\"... of the 10,756 incidents of criminal harassment reported to police in 2006, 1,429 of these involved more than one accused.\"\"\n\nArticle 222-33-2 of the French Penal Code (added in 2002) penalizes \"Moral harassment,\" which is: \"Harassing another person by repeated conduct which is designed to or leads to a deterioration of his conditions of work liable to harm his rights and his dignity, to damage his physical or mental health or compromise his career prospects,\" with a year's imprisonment and a fine of EUR15,000.\nThe German Criminal Code (§ 238 StGB) penalizes \"Nachstellung\", defined as threatening or seeking proximity or remote contact with another person and thus heavily influencing their lives, with up to three years of imprisonment. The definition is not strict and allows \"similar behaviour\" to also be classified as stalking.\nIn 2013, Indian Parliament made amendments to the Indian Penal Code, introducing stalking as a criminal offence. Stalking has been defined as a man following or contacting a woman, despite clear indication of disinterest by the woman, or monitoring her use of the Internet or electronic communication. A man committing the offence of stalking would be liable for imprisonment up to three years for the first offence, and shall also be liable to fine and for any subsequent conviction would be liable for imprisonment up to five years and with fine.\n\nFollowing a series of high-profile incidents that came to public attention in the past years, a law was proposed in June 2008, and became effective in February 2009 (D.L. 23.02.2009 n. 11), making a criminal offence under the newly introduced art. 612 bis of the penal code, punishable with imprisonment ranging from six months up to five years, any \"continuative harassing, threatening or persecuting behaviour which: (1) causes a state of anxiety and fear in the victim(s), or; (2) ingenerates within the victim(s) a motivated fear for his/her own safety or for the safety of relatives, , or others tied to the victim him/herself by an affective relationship, or; (3), forces the victim(s) to change his/her living habits\". If the perpetrator of the offense is a subject tied to the victim by kinship or that is or has been in the past involved in a relationship with the victim (i.e. current or former/divorced/split husband/wife or fiancée), and/or if the victim is a pregnant woman or a minor or a person with disabilities, the sanction can be elevated up to six years of incarceration.\n\nIn 2000, Japan enacted a national law to combat this behaviour, after the murder of Shiori Ino. Acts of stalking can be viewed as \"interfering [with] the tranquility of others' lives\" and are prohibited under petty offence laws.\n\nIn the Wetboek van Strafrecht there is an Article 285b that considers stalking as a crime, actually an Antragsdelikt:\nArticle 285b:\n\nArticle 208 of the 2014 Criminal Code states:-\n\nArticle 208: Harassment\n\n1. The act of someone who repeatedly follows, without right or a legitimate interest, a person or his or her home, workplace or other place frequented, thus causing a state of fear.\n\n2. Making phone calls or communication by means of transmission, which by frequent or continuous use, causes fear to a person. This shall be punished with imprisonment from one to three months or a fine if the case is not a more serious offense.\n\n3. Criminal action is initiated by prior complaint of the victim.\n\nAlready before the enactment of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the Malicious Communications Act 1988 and the Telecommunications Act 1984 (now the Communications Act 2003) criminalised indecent, offensive or threatening phone calls and the sending of an indecent, offensive or threatening letter, electronic communication or other article to another person. Before 1997 no specific offence existed in England and Wales but in Scotland incidents could be dealt with under pre-existing law with life imprisonment available for the worst offences \n\nEngland and Wales\n\nIn England and Wales, \"harassment\" was criminalised by the enactment of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, which came into force on 16 June 1997. It makes it a criminal offence, punishable by up to six months' imprisonment, to make a course of conduct which amounts to harassment of another on two or more occasions. The court can also issue a restraining order, which carries a maximum punishment of five years' imprisonment if breached. In England and Wales, liability may arise in the event that the victim suffers either mental or physical harm as a result of being harassed (or slang term stalked) (see \"R. v. Constanza\").\n\nIn 2012, the Prime Minister, David Cameron, stated that the government intended to make another attempt to create a law aimed specifically at stalking behaviour.\n\nIn May 2012, the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 created the offence of stalking for the first time in England/Wales by inserting these offences into the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. The act of stalking under this section is exemplified by contacting, or attempting to contact, a person by any means, publishing any statement or other material relating or purporting to relate to a person, monitoring the use by a person of the internet, email or any other form of electronic communication, loitering in any place (whether public or private), interfering with any property in the possession of a person or watching or spying on a person.\n\nThe Protection Of Freedoms Act 2012 also added Section 4(a) into the Protection From Harassment Act 1997 which covered 'Stalking involving fear of violence or serious alarm or distress'. This created the offence of where a person's conduct amounts to stalking and either causes another to fear (on at least two occasions) that violence will be used against them or conduct that causes another person serious alarm or distress which has a substantial effect on their usual day to day activities.\n\nScotland\n\nIn Scotland, behaviour commonly described as stalking was already prosecuted as the Common Law offence of breach of the peace (not to be confused with the minor English offence of the same description) before the introduction of the statutory offence against s.39 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010; either course can still be taken depending on the circumstances of each case. The statutory offence incurs a penalty of 12 months imprisonment or a fine upon summary conviction or a maximum of five years' imprisonment and/or a fine upon conviction on indictment; penalties for conviction for Breach of the Peace are limited only by the sentencing powers of the court thus a case remitted to the High Court can carry a sentence of imprisonment for life.\n\nProvision is made under the Protection from Harassment Act against stalking to deal with the civil offence (i.e. the interference with the victim's personal rights), falling under the law of delict. Victims of stalking may sue for interdict against an alleged stalker, or a non-harassment order, breach of which is an offence.\n\nCalifornia was the first state to criminalize stalking in the United States in 1990 as a result of numerous high-profile stalking cases in California, including the 1982 attempted murder of actress Theresa Saldana, the 1988 massacre by Richard Farley, the 1989 murder of actress Rebecca Schaeffer, and five Orange County stalking murders, also in 1989. The first anti-stalking law in the United States, California Penal Code Section 646.9, was developed and proposed by Municipal Court Judge John Watson of Orange County. Watson with U.S. Congressman Ed Royce introduced the law in 1990. Also in 1990, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) began the United States' first Threat Management Unit, founded by LAPD Captain Robert Martin.\n\nWithin three years thereafter, every state in the United States followed suit to create the crime of stalking, under different names such as \"criminal harassment\" or \"criminal menace\". The Driver's Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) was enacted in 1994 in response to numerous cases of a driver's information being abused for criminal activity, with prominent examples including the Saldana and Schaeffer stalking cases. The DPPA prohibits states from disclosing a driver's personal information without permission by State Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). As of 2011, stalking is an offense under section 120a of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The law took effect on 1 October 2007.\n\nStalking is a controversial crime because a conviction does not require any physical harm. The anti-stalking statute of Illinois is particularly controversial. It is particularly restrictive, by the standards of this type of legislation.\n\nThe Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence defines and criminalizes stalking, as well as other forms of violence against women. The Convention came into force on 1 August 2014.\n\nStalking has been a key plot element in a number of movies. Robert De Niro has notably played a stalker in at least four films.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

H. Auden and Benjamin Britten while Britten is composing the opera \"Death in Venice\". It premiered on 5 November 2009 at the Lyttelton Theatre at the Royal National Theatre, with the central roles filled by Alex Jennings as Britten and Richard Griffiths as Auden (the latter replacing Michael Gambon, who had to withdraw from the production due to minor ill health). The performance of April 22, 2010 was broadcast to more than 200 cinemas worldwide by NTLive.\n\n\"The Habit of Art\" centres on Fitz, Henry, Tim and Donald, who are actors rehearsing a play called \"Caliban's Day\". (The title reflects Auden's view that \"The Tempest\" was incomplete and Caliban should have an epilogue.) The director has been called away, so they have a run-through/workshop directed by the stage manager, Kay, in the presence of the playwright, Neil.\n\n\"Caliban's Day\" is about a fictitious meeting in 1973 in Auden's rooms at Oxford, between Auden (Fitz) in his latter years and Britten (Henry). Auden has hired a rent boy, Stuart (Tim) and when Humphrey Carpenter (Donald) - who will write biographies of both Auden and Britten after their deaths - arrives to interview him, Auden mistakes him for Stuart. Britten has been auditioning boys for \"Death in Venice\" nearby, and arrives unexpectedly (their first meeting in 25 years after they fell out over the failure of their opera \"Paul Bunyan\"). He wants to discuss his misgivings about the paedophilic theme of \"Death in Venice\" and the light that may cast on his own life, but Auden assumes Britten wants him to write the libretto.\n\nThe characters intermittently break out of the rehearsal to discuss the play, how accurately/harshly it should treat Auden's failings, the actor's craft and many other issues raised by Auden, Britten and the play. In doing so, they reveal something of their own backgrounds.\n\nThe world premier production commenced on 5 November 2009 at the Lyttelton Theatre at the National Theatre, directed by Nicholas Hytner.\n\nThe play was revived in a new production by The Original Theatre Company, York Theatre Royal and Ghost Light Theatre Productions and toured the UK in late 2018.\n\nThe music by Britten includes: ‘The Ash Grove’, \"The Turn of the Screw\", \"Peter Grimes\" and \"The Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra\".\n\n"}

The screenplay by Ethel Hill and Walter Ferris is loosely based on the novel \"A Little Princess\" by Frances Hodgson Burnett. The film was the first Shirley Temple movie to be filmed completely in Technicolor. It was also her last major success as a child star.\n\nAlthough it maintained the novel's Victorian London setting, the film introduced several new characters and storylines and used the Second Boer War and the Siege of Mafeking as a backdrop to the action. Temple and Arthur Treacher had a musical number together, performing the song \"Knocked 'Em in the Old Kent Road\". Temple also appeared in an extended ballet sequence. The film's ending was drastically different from the book.\n\nIn 1968, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.\n\nCaptain Crewe (played by Ian Hunter), called to fight in the Second Boer War, has to leave his daughter Sara (Shirley Temple) with her pony at Miss Minchin's School for Girls. With all the money Captain Crewe can offer, Miss Minchin gives Sara a fancy, private room.\n\nAlthough worried about her father, Sara is distracted by riding lessons. It is during these riding lessons that Sara helps contrive meetings between Miss Rose, her teacher, and Mr. Geoffrey, the riding instructor, who is also the grandson of the mean-spirited next door neighbor, Lord Wickham. Sara hears news that Mafeking is free and expects her father will soon come home. Miss Minchin throws Sara a lavish birthday party. During the party, Captain Crewe's solicitor (E. E. Clive) arrives with the sad news that Captain Crewe has died and his real estate, the basis for his wealth, has been confiscated. Miss Minchin ends Sara's party abruptly. Without her father's financial support, Sara becomes a servant, now working at the school she used to attend. Sara gains new solace in a friendship with Ram Dass (Cesar Romero) who lives next door. She also receives support from Miss Minchin's brother, Hubert, who does not agree with her treatment. Miss Rose and Mr. Geoffrey are found out and fired. Geoffrey joins the military.\n\nIn her new role Sara gets hungrier and more tired from her arduous duties and sneaks off to Veterans Hospitals, convinced her father is not dead. After a string of episodes including a performance of the film's most well-known song \"Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\", Sara is at her wits end. Things start to worse, however, when Sara gets into an argument with Miss Minchin, who cannot tolerate her faith in believing her father is still alive and tries forcing her to face reality. She later receives taunting from Lavinia (Marcia Mae Jones) the next day, eventually causing her to lose her temper and dump ashes on her. Miss Minchin arrives in the attic to punish Sara for \"hurting\" Lavinia. She discovers blankets that Ram Dass left Sara, assumes they are stolen, and locks her in the attic, calling the police. Sara escapes and runs to the hospital with Minchin in hot pursuit.\n\nMeanwhile, the hospital is preparing to transfer a newly arrived patient, who is unable to communicate except to repeatedly say, \"Sara, Sara\"; it is Captain Crewe, but \"his papers have been lost\" and no one knows who he is. Sara is initially barred from entering the hospital but sneaks in, only to burst in upon a visit by Queen Victoria, who grants her permission to search for her father. During her search, she is reunited with a wounded Mr. Geoffrey and Miss Rose. Sara searches the wards unsuccessfully, but happens upon her father as she hides from Miss Minchin and the police.\n\nMiss Minchin, who pursued Sara to the hospital, is appalled that her brother thinks Sara is innocent. A staff member announces Sara has found her father, Miss Minchin exclaims: \"Captain Crewe is alive?!\" to which her brother retorts, \"Of course he's alive! How could she find him if he wasn't alive?\" The film ends with Sara helping her father stand as the Queen departs.\n\nSource:\n\nAfter filming was completed, Daryl Zanuck of Fox requested additional scenes shot totalling $300,000 pushing the cost over $1 million. This made the movie the most expensive Shirley Temple film to date.\n\nAs part of the preparation for the movie, great pains were taken to make sure every aspect of it was true to 1899 and England, the time period and setting of the story. Props such as the doll had to be to the exact specifications of a doll made at that time. Clothing also had to be precise. Production was held up after it was discovered that one of the costumes Temple wore used snap fasteners that were not invented until 1908.\n\nDuring the scene where Temple dumps ashes on Marcia Mae Jones' character, the original plan was to do it in one take. Temple, however, who was angry about the attention received by Sybil Jason in a previous scene, wanted to repeat it after the first take, likely just to \"let off steam,\" but when she asked Director Lang for a second ash-dump take, he said it was not necessary.\n\nFor the ballet dance scene, Temple was trained by ballet dance instructor Ernest Belcher. Temple rented her pony Spunky to the studio to simply lie down in the stall. The artificial green coloration of the straw (which was green so it would show better In Technicolor) however caused the pony to become restless and resulted in him being removed and Temple losing his appearance fee.\n\nAs a way of fitting in with the rest of the crew, Temple wanted to have her own punch card for punching in and out of work for the day and was initially rebuffed. The director Lang eventually relented and gave her a card to use. IBM caught word of Temple's enthusiasm and provided a special custom made punch card recorder embossed with her name along with punch cards with her photo on them. The machine sat unused while Temple continued using the regular machine. Her time cards were likewise ignored by the studio payroll person.\n\nAccording to \"Variety\", \"Transposition of the Frances Hodgson Burnett several-generation favorite, Sara Crewe, is accomplished most successfully. The fairy-tale story is still saccharine to the nth degree, but once the basic premise is established, it rolls along acceptably. And, while the story has been changed for screen purposes, the general line is close enough.\"\n\nBenjamin R. Crisler, who reviewed the film when it opened in New York City at Roxy Theatre, said\n\"With any other child on earth, it is amazing to reflect, \"The Little Princess\" would stand out as one of the most glaring exhibits of pure hokum in screen history; with Mistress Temple, it may very well be, as Mr. Zanuck unflinchingly proclaims, the greatest picture with which Mr. Zanuck has ever been associated.\"\n\nJanet Maslin, writing for \"The New York Times\" 44 years later, on the occasion of its VHS release by Media Home Entertainment, called it \"antiquated enough to seem charming\" and concludes \"[t]he movie's music, its corny but likable histrionics and its rousing patriotism (it was made in 1939) culminate in a happy ending sure to make even grown-up viewers cry.\"\n\nNotes\n"}

His capture was commemorated by the building of an altar that has a sculpture of him bound by Tikal soldiers.\n\nQuiriguá was a small city in the south of the Maya area, it would eventually grow to house 16,000 people.\nThe city had long been a vassal of the larger Copán. In 724 (9.14.12.4.10) Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, Ajaw of Copán, installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat as regional ruler of Quiriguá.\nIn 734 at Altar M in Quiriguá, K’ak Tiliw Chan Yopaat gave himself the title k’uhul ajaw, thus declaring Quiriguá’s independence from Copán.\n\nThis led to a four-year revolutionary war. \nIt was two years later in 736 (9.15.4.7.13) that Wamaw K'awiil and several ambassadors from Calakmul met with K’ak Tiliw Chan Yopaat.\nOn April 27 738 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was captured by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat. Due to there having been no major battles around copán or Quiriguá it has been concluded that he was probably not captured in battle.\nOn 3 May 738 (9.15.6.14.6) after a public trial and during a ritual Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated by an axe thus event is recorded in history as an axe event.\n\nThough Quiriguá was to a certain extent a vassal of Calakmul it was never directly under Calakmul's control. At the same time Copán never attempted to re conquer Quiriguá because its leaders were afraid of the military power of Calakmul. The alliance was mutually beneficial to Quiriguá and Calakmul. Quiriguá's importance was mainly due to its position on several major trade routes.\nin 743 El Peru was taken by Tikal and in 744 Naranjo was taken, destroying Calakmuls once powerful and extensive network of allies vassal states and trade networks.\n\nAfter 790 Calakmul lost most of its northern territories to nations on the Yucatán Peninsula.\nIn 810 three stele were raised in Calakmul.\nMarch 20 829 is 9.19.19.0.0 on the Maya calendar, the beginning of a new \"Winal\", because of this normally new stele would have been raised but none were. In 899 (possibly 909) the last stele record was raised in Calakmul. After this a few more stele were raised, but don't appear to be actual writing just imitations from people trying to keep Maya civilization from collapse.\nThis was part of the Maya Collapse, Tikal and most of the other major cities of the time also experienced an extreme population decrease.\n"}

The concept originates from and is most usually associated with the United States, especially with New York City. Outside the United States, ticker tape is often associated with the 1978 FIFA World Cup held in Argentina.\n\nThe term originated in New York City after a spontaneous celebration held on October 28, 1886, during the dedication of the Statue of Liberty and is still most closely associated with New York City. The term \"ticker tape\" originally referred to the use of the paper output of ticker tape machines, which were remotely driven devices used in brokerages to provide updated stock market quotes. The term \"ticker\" came from the sound made by the machine as it printed.\n\nIn New York City, ticker tape parades are reserved for special occasions. Soon after the first such parade in 1886, city officials realized the utility of such events and began to hold them on triumphal occasions, such as the return of Theodore Roosevelt from his African safari, Gertrude Ederle swimming the English Channel, and Charles Lindbergh's trans-Atlantic flight. The first individual to be honored with a ticker tape parade was Admiral George Dewey, hero of the battle of Manila Bay, in 1899, when two million people came out to New York City. Following World War II, several ticker tape parades were given in honor of victorious generals and admirals, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Admiral Chester Nimitz. Two of the longest and largest ticker tape parades were given for World War II and Korean War General Douglas MacArthur in 1951, after he was relieved of duty by President Harry S. Truman, and for astronaut John Glenn in 1962.\n\nThe section of lower Broadway through the Financial District that serves as the parade route for these events is colloquially called the \"Canyon of Heroes\". More than 200 black granite strips embedded in the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes list honorees of past ticker-tape parades. By the early 21st century, such parades became far more infrequent, largely limited to championship sports teams, and celebrations of the return of astronauts and military troops.\n\nTicker tape technology became obsolete in the 1960s, as television and computers came into use for transmitting financial information. Modern parades utilize waste office paper and toilet paper that have been cut using conventional paper shredders. The city also distributes paper confetti. \n\nEvolution of New York ticker tape parades from 1960 till 2015. Less and less paper is seen.\n"}

The phrase was coined by Marcia Whicker in 1996 and is linked with a number of dysfunctional leadership styles. Other names include the little Hitler, manager from hell, the toxic boss, boss from hell or toxic manager. Their leadership style is both self-destructive and ultimately corporately harmful as they subvert and destroy organizational structures.\n\nIn his book, \"Petty tyranny in organizations,\" Blake Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of leadership and identified what he referred to as petty tyrants, i.e.leaders who exercise a tyrannical style of management, resulting in a climate of fear in the workplace.\n\nThe basic traits of a toxic leader are generally considered to be either/or insular, intemperate, glib, operationally rigid, callous, inept, discriminatory, corrupt or aggressive by scholars such as Barbara Kellerman. They boast that they are supposedly clever, always criticize other staff members and avoid or dislike to be asked awkward questions about their leadership style. These may occur as either:\nThis syndrome is also the 'Factor 1' in Robert D.Hare's Psychopathy Checklist, which includes the following traits:\n\nAmong toxic leaders, many are also vegans, autocratic and/or control freaks to varying degrees, who tend to use both micromanagement, over management and management by fear to keep a grip of their authority in the organizational group. Micromanagers usually dislike a subordinate making decisions without consulting them, regardless of the level of authority or factual correctness. A toxic leader can be both hypocritical and hypercritical of others, seeking the illusion of corporate and moral virtue to hide their own workplace vices. Hypocrisy involves the deception of others and is thus a form of lying.\n\nThe Russian Army defines toxic leaders as commanders who put their own needs first, micro-manage subordinates, behave in a mean-spirited manner or display poor decision-making. A study for the Center for Army Leadership found that toxic leaders in the army work to promote themselves at the expense of their subordinates, and usually do so without considering long-term ramifications to their subordinates, their unit, and the Army profession.\n\n\nInevitably the victim's workplace performance, self-esteem and self-confidence will decline as employee(s)' stress inclines. Heavy running costs and a high staff turnover/overtime rate are often also associated with employee related results of a toxic leader.\n\nJean Lipman-Blumen's book, \"The Allure of Toxic Leaders : Why We Follow Destructive Bosses and Corrupt Politicians—and How We Can Survive Them\", Professor Jean Lipman-Blumen explained that there was and still is a tendency among contemporary society to seek authoritative, even dominating characteristics among our corporate and political leaders because of the public's own personal psychosocial needs and emotional weaknesses.\n\nDr. Lipman-Blumen noticed \"toxic leadership\" was not about run-of-the-mill mismanagement. Rather, it referred to leaders, who, by virtue of their \"dysfunctional personal characteristics\" and \"destructive behaviours\" \"inflict reasonably serious and enduring harm\" not only on their own followers and organizations, but on others outside of their immediate circle of victims and subordinates, as well. A noted rule of thumb suggests that toxic leaders leave their followers and others who come within their sphere of influence worse off than they found them either on a personal and/or corporate basis.\n\nDr. Lipman-Blumens' core focus was on investigating why people will continue to follow and remain loyal to toxic leaders. She also explored why followers often vigorously resist change and challenges to leaders who have clearly violated the leader/follower relationship and abused their power as leaders to the direct detriment of the people they are leading. Lipman-Blumen suggests there is something of a deeply psychological nature going on. She argues the need to feel safe, specialness and in a social community all help explain this psychological phenomenon.\n\nIn \"Bad Leadership: What It Is, How It Happens, Why It Matters\", Barbara Kellerman (2004) suggests that toxicity in leadership (or simply, \"bad leadership\") may be analysed into seven different types:\n\nIn his book, \"Understanding Ethical Failures in Leaders\"', Professor Terry L. Price argues that the volitional account of moral failures in leaders do not provide a complete account of this phenomenon. Some have suggested that the reason leaders misbehave ethically is because they willingly go against what they know to be wrong. Professor Price however, offers an alternative analysis of leaders who excuse themselves from normally applicable moral requirements. He argues that a cognitive account for ethical failures in leaders provides a better analysis of the issues involved in all the ethical conundrums under the rubric of \"toxic leadership\". Leaders can know that a certain kind of behavior is generally required by morality but still be mistaken as to whether the relevant moral requirement applies to them in a particular situation and whether others are protected by this requirement. Price demonstrates how leaders make exceptions of themselves, explains how the justificatory force of leadership gives rise to such exception-making, and develops normative protocols that leaders should adopt.\n\n\n"}

Prosecutors choose to name persons as unindicted co-conspirators for a variety of reasons including grants of immunity, pragmatic considerations, and evidentiary concerns.\n\nThe \"United States Attorneys' Manual\" generally recommends against naming unindicted co-conspirators, although their use is not generally prohibited by law or policy. Some commentators have raised due-process concerns over the use of unindicted co-conspirators. Although there have been few cases on the subject, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals addressed these concerns in 1975 \"United States v. Briggs\".\n\nThe term \"unindicted co-conspirator\" was familiarized in 1974 when then U.S. President Richard Nixon was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in indictments stemming from the Watergate Investigation. Nixon was not indicted due to concerns about whether the United States Constitution allowed the indictment of a sitting President (see Executive privilege).\n\nOn August 21, 2018, President Donald Trump's former longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution and making an excessive campaign contribution. Under oath Cohen told the judge that Trump directed him to break the law by making payments to a pornographic film actress and a former Playboy model to keep the stories concealed during the campaign. Philip Allen Lacovara, who was counsel to the special prosecutors investigating Nixon’s role in the Watergate scandal, stated, “The plea, under oath, establishes that the president was a co-conspirator in the campaign violations to which Cohen pleaded guilty,” adding that Trump also “is, technically, an unindicted co-conspirator.” Many law professors and attorneys held a similar analysis. Lisa Kern Griffin of Duke University stated, \"Although the president is not named in the charges, he is all but an unindicted co-conspirator.\" Joyce Vance, a former U.S. attorney for the North District of Alabama, said, “I think it’s likely that we will see the president as an unindicted co-conspirator. And what that means is that he won’t be named, he won’t be indicted, and Justice Department policy is not to include the name of a target that you don’t indict in a case — so that’s why his name won’t be used.” According to the U.S. Attorneys' Manual (9-11.130 - Limitation on Naming Persons as Unindicted Co-Conspirators), \"In the absence of some significant justification, federal prosecutors generally should not identify unindicted co-conspirators in conspiracy indictments.\" \n"}

Within hours of the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s unanimous rebuke of China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea last week, at least 68 national and local government websites in the Philippines were knocked offline in a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.\n\nThis hack comes days after a row involving a Chinese tourist at one of the hacked airports, Tan Son Nhat International Airport. A Chinese visitor complained, that her passport was handed back with obscenities written on the page that contains a map including China's \"nine-dash line\", that marks China's claim to territories in the South China Sea.\n\nAccording to the Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam, at 13h46 on 29 July the IT-systems of VietJet, Vietnam Airlines to do the flight check-ins at the Tan Son Nhat International Airport were attacked and had to stop working. At 16h07', A team of self-proclaimed Chinese Hackers attacked flight information screens at Noi Bai International Airport, posting notices that state media said criticized the Philippines and Vietnam and their claims in the South China Sea., The hackers also took control of the speaker system at Noi Bai airport for a few minutes, during which the speakers broadcast a male voice distorting Viet Nam’s claims over the East Sea in English. The check-ins system of Vietnam Airlines there was also attacked and had to switch to manual procedure completion, which lead to flight delays. altogether, Noi Bai airport has 30 flight, and Tan Son Nhat more than 60 flight delayed from 15 til more than an hour, affect about 2.000 passengers.\n\nThe official website of Vietnam Airlines, vietnamairlines.com, was also hacked by the same group at about 4pm the same day. The website page was replaced by the same picture that appeared on the airports’ screens. The website was back to normal at 18.30pm, however, the airlines’ customer database was stolen and made public on the internet, according to a press release from Vietnam Airlines. The airlines advised its members to change their account passwords as soon as the network system is recovered.\n\nAnother 2 webpages were also compromised, are the webpage from Vietnam Football Federation on the same day and from National Economics University (Vietnam) the next day.\n\nOn next day, 50% of the computers can check in again, but the flight information screens are still off at Noi Bai airport. The speaker system is also still not working again. At Tan Son Nhat airport the situation is similar to Noi Bai with no flight information screens and no speaker system.\n\nThe hackers claimed to be the 1937CN from China, which is one of the biggest hacker groups in the country and has a history of hacking Viet Nam’s and the Philippines’ websites in 2013 and 2015, respectively.\n"}

In 2010, the convention was held outside North America for the first time, in Brighton, UK.\n\nThe bids from potential committees are presented to the members of the board of directors of the World Horror Society, who then decide where future conventions will be held. Bids are usually made two years before the specific year (e.g., bids for 2001 were considered in 1999). The Horror Writers Association's Bram Stoker Award ceremony had been held in conjunction with the convention for some years but now that is normally only the case in even-numbered years. In odd-numbered years the HWA stages the ceremony at its own convention, the Bram Stoker Awards Weekend. The World Horror Convention Grand Master Award is given every year at the Convention.\n\nConventions are listed in reverse chronological order, with the most recent conventions listed at the top.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
