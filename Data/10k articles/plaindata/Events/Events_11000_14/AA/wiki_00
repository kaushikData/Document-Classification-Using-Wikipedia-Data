The construction of New York City, under both the Dutch and the English, was accomplished largely with slave labor. Due to their low social standing, the bodies of slaves could only be buried outside the city limits. Most often they were buried in a few plots north of Chambers Street, across the street from the Pauper's Cemetery, often with several bodies to a grave, in a site now marked by the African Burial Ground National Monument, then known as the \"Negroes Burying Ground\".\n\nBoth cemeteries were close to Columbia College, which housed the city's only school of medicine. Due to taboos associated with the violation of corpses, procuring cadavers for study was difficult, and many students and doctors would exhume bodies from the nearby graveyards, due to the socially marginalized status of their occupants. “Resurrection”, as body-snatching or grave-robbing was called, was the cheapest, surest way to obtain the remains of the newly deceased, especially in the winter when bodies decayed slower.\n\nBecause there was, at the time, no known method of preserving an entire corpse, thefts were performed hastily, often in winter to slow the rate of decomposition. In the winter of 1788, the number of corpses being exhumed by students increased substantially. The activities of medical students and physicians, who were known colloquially as \"Resurrectionists\" in the Black cemetery, were noticed by a group of freedmen who, on February the 3rd, petitioned the Common Council to take action against it. The petition was largely ignored, and no effort was made to stop the unlicensed exhumations.\n\nIn April 1788, a group of children were playing outside the New York Hospital, next to a room where a student of the physician Richard Bayley, who was known to exhume corpses from the two cemeteries, was dissecting an arm. Bayley, born and bred in Connecticut, had received his medical education in England, where body-snatching was more common. There were whispers about him “cutting up his patients and performing cruel experiments upon the sick”. \n\nThe student, named John Hicks, waved the arm out at the children, telling a boy whose mother had recently died that it belonged to her. The boy ran home and told his father of this, who, after exhuming his wife's coffin and finding it empty, amassed a group of concerned citizens who marched to the hospital and began to mass around the building. \n\nThe mob eventually broke into the hospital and, after becoming incensed upon finding several bodies in various stages of mutilation, pulled Richard Bayley's assistant Wright Post and a number of his students into the street, where the mayor of New York City, James Duane intervened and ordered them escorted to the jailhouse for protection.\n\nA crowd of 2,000 people had gathered, and news spread of the horrors seen in the hospital, leading to widespread rioting, with the few physicians remaining in New York City being forced into hiding. A large group of rioters descended upon Broadway, searching for John Hicks, who was felt by the crowd to be the main source of blame. As they assembled in front of the courthouse, throwing rocks, militia and cavalry were called in to repel them. The riot lasted a few days, ceasing when Governor Clinton sent the militia to patrol the streets until a calm environment was ensured.\n\nAt least three rioters and three militiamen died in the confrontation; some estimate up to 20 dead. The protesters also destroyed all the available human specimens.\n\nPublic opinion of the physicians in New York stood very low for many years, and while some students were brought to trial, Hicks was not among them. Post-mortem dissection was considered an indignity to the dead and the city fathers even forbade using bodies abandoned in the rougher parts of the city. A year later, in January 1789, a statute was finally put into law in order to codify the proper treatment of corpses, with harsh punishments imposed for those who violated it. Anyone who broke the law would stand on the pillory or be publicly whipped, fined, or imprisoned. \n\nThe statute also permitted the bodies of executed criminals to be used in dissection, “in order that science [might not] be injured by preventing the dissection of proper subjects”. “Resurrection men”, professionals who used stealth and discretion, were recruited to replace the students and went on to control the supply of cadavers for generations. Throughout the 1700s, British law considered dissection as a worse punishment than death. \n\nTo discourage dueling, the Massachusetts General Court also imposed dissection as a threat by ruling that anyone who died as a result of a duel would be sentenced to post-mortem dissection and dismemberment. Dissection was seen as perhaps one of the worst things that could happen to a person after death.\n\n\n\n"}

The MTP carried out the assault under the false pretense of preventing a military coup, allegedly planned for the end of January 1989 by the \"Carapintadas\", a group of far-right military officers opposed to the investigations concerning the \"Dirty War\". The Argentine president of the time, Raúl Alfonsín declared that the attack, with the ultimate goal of sparking a massive popular uprising, could have led to civil war. Given a life sentence and imprisoned, as his comrades, in high security quarters, Gorriarán Merlo was eventually freed in 2003. He died on 22 September 2006 while awaiting surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n\nOn 23 January 1989, a group of approximatively 40 members of the \"Movimiento Todos por la Patria\" (\"All for the Motherland\" Movement, \"MTP\", founded in 1986 by former ERP leader Enrique Gorriarán Merlo) attacked the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Regiment barracks in La Tablada (\"Regimiento de Infantería Mecanizada Nº 3\", RIM3). They broke into the barracks by ramming a stolen truck into the main gate, followed by several other vehicles.\n\nAccording to \"Clarín\" newspaper, three different versions about the attack exist. Ten days before the assault, lawyer and MTP member Jorge Baños had declared in a conference that the \"Carapintadas\" were planning a coup for the end of January. The \"Carapintadas\" were members of the Armed Forces that had rebelled against the national government three times in 1987 and 1988, protesting the investigations on human rights abuses during the \"National Reorganization Process\" (1976–1983). This has remained to this day the MTP's version, held in particular by the late Gorriarán Merlo who claimed that the MTP was fulfilling the constitutional obligation of \"\"bear[ing] arms in defense of the fatherland and of [the] Constitution\".\nThe official report on the attack by head of the Army Francisco Gassino claimed in contrary that it was the MTP, formed of several former ERP members, that had planned a coup. A last version claims that the MTP was victim of a manipulation by intelligence services. A sociologist and professor who published an investigation into the attack believes the MTP had wider aims: \"They weren’t planning to put down a coup. They were creating the false image of a coup, to set the scene, but were planning to take the barracks and from there start a revolution.\"\n\nThe Argentine Army, assisted by the Buenos Aires Police (a total of 3,600 personnel) was called on to counterattack, and indiscriminately used white phosphorus (WP) in the zone, in violation of the Geneva Conventions, which in civil wars are only binding with the consent of both parties, and not at all in police actions. The use of WP in combat is forbidden by international law. In this case, it had the effect of completely burning the barracks and of carbonizing corpses. 39 people were killed and 60 injured during the attack (the majority by conventional weapons). Nine were military personnel, two were police officers and the 28 remaining were members of the MTP. Lawyer Jorge Baños was among the dead. In addition, 53 soldiers and police were wounded in the fighting.\n\nThe following day, President Raúl Alfonsín (UCR, 1983–89) visited the site, protected by Argentine Army commandos, along with federal the judge of Morón, Gerardo Larrambebere, who is today member of the court presiding over the 1994 AMIA bombing case.\n\nRetired sergeant José Almada, who had participated in the capture of the MTP members, declared in 2004 that Iván Ruiz and José Díaz had been tortured. According to sergeant Almada, they referred to two persons who were not members of their brigade, and most probably SIDE agents. He identified one of them as Jorge Varando, chief of security of HSBC corporation in Buenos Aires during the December 2001 events. Furthermore, sergeant Almada declared that he had clearly heard a radio conversation ordering to kill two of the captured prisoners. He also said that adjutant sergeant Esquivel, killed during the attack, had been in fact shot by the Army itself, after trying to get to his brother who had been taken prisoner. Sergeant Almada explicitly denounced the OAS report written by Jorge Varando and General Arrillaga, the highest-ranking official in charge of the repression, which aimed at disguising adjutant sergeant Esquivel's suspicious death.\n\nJosé Almada said that he had tried to inform his hierarchy about these human rights violations, in accordance with article 194 of the Military Justice Code, but that they ignored him. He notably tried to inform General Martín Balza. He also informed head of Argentine Army, General Bonifacio Cáceres, also telling him about his concerns that his neighbours were insulting him, saying that they were responsible of new cases of \"desaparecidos\". Moreover, in his complaint before justice, he also said he had informed former head of the Army Ricardo Brinzoni. After Cáceres's retirement in 1989, colonel Gasquet threatened José Almada of 40 days of arrest — he was finally given two days of arrest on charges of wearing a beard, and then sent him to Paraná, Entre Ríos. Later, he was again sentenced to 30 days of arrest, confined to Crespo near Paraná and finally forced to retire. He still claims to this day he is still being \"persecuted.\"\n\nThe MTP guerrillas were also accused of human right violations. As a conscript serving in the 3rd Infantry Regiment, Eduardo Navascues was taken prisoner early in the assault and suffered shrapnel wounds in the fighting that followed. Despite having been shot several years later in an attempt to silence him, he has given testimony in a recent court case alleging human rights abuses including physical and mental torture at the hand of the guerrillas. Another conscript, Private Víctor Eduardo Scarafiocco claimed that he and others were used as human shields by the guerrillas and that Private Héctor Cardozo was killed as a result.\n\nTwenty surviving members of the MTP were later convicted and given sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment. They were judged under the \"Ley de Defensa de la Democracia (Argentina)\" (Defense of the Democracy Act) which deprive them of a right to appeal and to a new trial.\n\nEnrique Gorriarán Merlo was given a life sentence, and his ex-wife, Ana María Sívori, was sentenced to 18 years of imprisonment.\nDuring the oral and public trial, Gorriarán put into question the legitimacy of the process and objected to the circumstances of his capture in the suburbs of Mexico in October 1995, which he called a \"kidnapping\". He was charged with being co-author of qualified illicit association, rebellion, usurpation, homicide with aggravated circumstances, aggravated illegal privation of freedom and reiterated injuries. His ex-wife Sívori was charged with being co-author of qualified illicit association, and secondary participant to offenses of rebellion, doubly aggravated homicide, tentative of homicide, aggravated theft, reiterated injuries and co-author of the use of false identity documents.\n\nMost of those convicted in the attacks were placed in a maximum security cell block on the eighteenth floor of the Caseros prison in Buenos Aires.\n\nFinally, President Fernando de la Rúa (Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, 1999–2001) commuted the prison sentences. And two days before Néstor Kirchner's access to his functions, Interim President Eduardo Duhalde (member of the Justicialist Party) freed Gorriarán Merlo, on 23 May 2003, after 14 years of prison in high security quarters, who declared that it was \"an act of justice\". Gorriarán Merlo died of a cardiac arrest at the Hospital Argerich in Buenos Aires, while he was about to be operated of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, on 22 September 2006, at the age of 64.\n\n"}

Early in the flight, the aircraft, which was climbing to its assigned altitude on autopilot, quickly lost cabin pressure and all six on board were incapacitated due to hypoxia – a lack of oxygen. The aircraft continued climbing past its assigned altitude, then failed to make the westward turn toward Dallas over north Florida and continued on its northwestern course, flying over the southern and midwestern United States for almost four hours and . The plane ran out of fuel over South Dakota and crashed into a field near Aberdeen after an uncontrolled descent. The two pilots were Michael Kling and Stephanie Bellegarrigue. The four passengers on board were PGA golfer Payne Stewart; his agents, Van Ardan and Robert Fraley; and Bruce Borland, a golf architect with the Jack Nicklaus golf course design company.\n\nOn October 25, 1999, Learjet 35, registration operated by Sunjet Aviation of Sanford, Florida, departed Orlando International Airport at 1319Z (0919 EDT) on a two-day, five-flight trip. Before departure, the aircraft had been fueled with of Jet A, enough for 4 hours and 45 minutes of flight. On board were two pilots and four passengers.\n\nAt 1327:13Z, the controller from the Jacksonville ARTCC instructed the pilot to climb and maintain flight level (FL) 390 ( above sea level). At 1327:18Z (0927:18 EDT), the pilot acknowledged the clearance by stating, \"three nine zero bravo alpha.\" This was the last known radio transmission from the airplane, and occurred while the aircraft was passing through . The next attempt to contact the aircraft occurred six minutes, 20 seconds later (14 minutes after departure), with the aircraft at , and the controller's message went unacknowledged. The controller attempted to contact N47BA five more times in the next minutes, again with no answer.\n\nAbout 1454Z (now 0954 CDT due to the flight's crossing into the Central Time zone), a U.S. Air Force F-16 test pilot from the 40th Flight Test Squadron at Eglin AFB in western Florida, who happened to be in the air nearby, was directed by controllers to intercept N47BA. When the fighter was about from the Learjet, at an altitude of about , the test pilot made two radio calls to N47BA but did not receive a response. The F-16 pilot made a visual inspection of the Lear, finding no visible damage to the airplane. Both engines were running, and the plane's red rotating anti-collision beacon was on (standard operation for aircraft in flight). The fighter pilot could not see inside the passenger section of the airplane because the windows seemed to be dark. Further, he stated that the entire right cockpit windshield was opaque, as if condensation or ice covered the inside. He also indicated that the left cockpit windshield was opaque, although several sections of the center of the windshield seemed to be only thinly covered by condensation or ice; a small rectangular section of the windshield was clear, with only a small section of the glare shield visible through this area. He did not see any flight control movement. At about 1512Z, the F-16 pilot concluded his inspection of N47BA and broke formation, proceeding to Scott AFB in southwestern Illinois.\n\nAt 1613Z, almost three hours into the flight of the unresponsive Learjet, two F-16s from the 138th Fighter Wing of the Oklahoma Air National Guard (ANG), flying under the call-sign \"TULSA 13 flight\", were directed by the Minneapolis ARTCC to intercept. The TULSA 13 lead pilot reported that he could not see any movement in the cockpit, that the windshield was dark and that he could not tell if the windshield was iced. A few minutes later, a TULSA 13 pilot reported, \"We're not seeing anything inside, could be just a dark cockpit though...he is not reacting, moving or anything like that he should be able to have seen us by now.\" At 1639Z, TULSA 13 left to rendezvous with a tanker for refueling.\n\nThe aircraft reached a maximum altitude of .\n\nAbout 1650Z, two F-16s from the 119th Wing of the North Dakota ANG with the identification \"NODAK 32 flight\" were directed to intercept N47BA. TULSA 13 flight also returned from refueling, and all four fighters maneuvered close to the Lear. The TULSA 13 lead pilot reported, \"We've got two visuals on it. It's looking like the cockpit window is iced over and there's no displacement in any of the control surfaces as far as the ailerons or trims.\" About 1701Z, TULSA 13 flight returned to the tanker again, while NODAK 32 remained with N47BA.\n\nThere was some speculation in the media that military jets were prepared to shoot down the Lear if it threatened to crash in a heavily populated area. Officials at the Pentagon strongly denied that possibility. Shooting down the plane \"was never an option,\" Air Force spokesman Captain Joe Della Vedova said, \"I don't know where that came from.\"\n\nThe Learjet's cockpit voice recorder (CVR), which was recovered from the wreckage, contained an audio recording of the last 30 minutes of the flight (it was an older model which only recorded 30 minutes of audio; the aircraft was not equipped with a flight data recorder). At 1710:41Z, the Learjet's engines can be heard winding down, indicating that the plane's fuel had been exhausted. In addition, sounds of the stick shaker and autopilot disconnect can be heard. With the engines powered down, the autopilot would have attempted to maintain altitude, causing the plane's airspeed to drop until it approached stall speed, at which point the stick shaker would have automatically engaged to warn the pilot and the autopilot would have switched itself off.\n\nAt 1711:01Z, the Lear began a right turn and descent. NODAK 32 remained to the west, while TULSA 13 broke away from the tanker and followed N47BA down. At 1711:26 CDT, the NODAK 32 lead pilot reported, \"The target is descending and he is doing multiple aileron rolls, looks like he's out of control...in a severe descent, request an emergency descent to follow target.\" The TULSA 13 pilot reported, \"It's soon to impact the ground; he is in a descending spiral.\" The fighter planes were forced to break off their pursuit at this point and had to land at local airports, having reached the limit of their endurance.\n\nImpact occurred approximately 1713Z, or 1213 local, after a total flight time of 3 hours, 54 minutes, with the aircraft hitting the ground at a nearly supersonic speed and an extreme angle. The Learjet crashed in South Dakota, just outside Mina in Edmunds County, on relatively flat ground and left a crater long, wide, and deep. None of its components remained intact.\n\nIn addition to Payne Stewart and three others, there were two pilots on board:\n\nThe 42-year-old captain, Michael Kling, held an airline transport pilot certificate and type ratings for the Boeing 707, Boeing 737, and Learjet 35. He also had Air Force experience flying the KC-135 and Boeing E-3 Sentry. Kling was also an instructor pilot on the KC-135E in the Maine Air National Guard. According to Sunjet Aviation records, the captain had accumulated a total of 4,280 hours of flight time (military and commercial) and had flown a total of 60 hours with Sunjet, 38 as a Learjet pilot-in-command and 22 as a Learjet second-in-command.\n\nThe first officer, 27-year-old Stephanie Bellegarrigue, held a commercial pilot certificate and type ratings for Learjet and Cessna Citation 500. She was also a certified flight instructor. She had accumulated a total of 1,751 hours of flight time, of which 251 hours were with Sunjet Aviation as a second-in-command and 99 as a Learjet second-in-command.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has several levels of investigation, of which the highest is a \"major\" investigation. Because of the extraordinary circumstances in this crash, a major investigation was performed.\n\nThe NTSB determined that:\nThe Board added a commentary regarding the possible reasons why the crew did not obtain supplemental oxygen:\n\nThe NTSB report showed that the plane had several instances of maintenance work related to cabin pressure in the months leading up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports that prompted them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve, as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.\n\nStewart was ultimately headed to Houston for the 1999 Tour Championship, but planned a stop in Dallas for discussions with the athletic department of his alma mater, Southern Methodist University, about building a new home course for the school's golf program. Stewart was memorialized at the Tour Championship with a lone bagpipe player playing at the first hole at Champions Golf Club prior to the beginning of the first day of play. The owner of the crash site, after consulting the wives of Stewart and several other victims, created a memorial on about of the site. At its center is a rock pulled from the site inscribed with the names of the victims and a Bible passage.\n\nThe 2000 U.S. Open, held at Pebble Beach Golf Links, began with a golf version of a 21-gun salute when 21 of Stewart's fellow players simultaneously hit balls into the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn 2001, Stewart was posthumously inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame.\n\nOn June 8, 2005, a Florida state court jury in Orlando found that Learjet was not liable for the deaths of Stewart and his agents Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, who had also been aboard the plane.\n\nThe documentary series \"Mayday,\" also known by the titles \"Air Crash Investigation\" and \"Air Disasters,\" features this incident in the first episode of its 16th season. The episode, titled \"Deadly Silence,\" was first transmitted on 7 June 2016.\n\n\n"}

The brutality of the crime, the fact that she was pregnant when she was killed and the length of time that she has remained unidentified created national attention. Beth Doe is believed to have been an immigrant from a Central European country.\n\nWhen discovered, Beth Doe, who was carrying a nine-month female fetus, had been sexually assaulted, strangled and shot in the neck by an unknown person. Her body was then dismembered with a serrated blade. Her nose, breasts, and ears had been severed and have never been found. The dismemberment was described to be unlike that of a surgeon, but not \"haphazard.\"\n\nThe parts of her body and that of her unborn daughter had been placed into three suitcases; two were striped with red, blue, and white, and the other one was tan with a plaid design. They were of vinyl material and were of the same size. It was evident that the suitcases had been spray-painted black at some point and that their handles had been severed.\n\nTo dispose of the body, the suitcases had been thrown off a bridge over the Lehigh River in White Haven, Pennsylvania along Interstate 80. They had fallen about 300 feet before hitting the ground. It is believed that the suitcases had been thrown out of a vehicle traveling west. The killer had most likely intended to have the suitcases land in the water below, to lessen the chance of their being found. Two of the suitcases had landed in the woods, 20 feet from the river; the third, containing the head and fetus, was found on the river bank.\n\nHaving fallen a long distance, two of the suitcases had opened and parts of the body had emerged. The head, fetus, and the two halves of the torso were exposed.\n\nOther evidence included straw, packaging foam, a bedspread, and waterlogged fragments of a newspaper later determined to have been \"The New York Sunday\" from September 26, 1976. The bedding and newspaper fragments had been wrapped over some of the body parts. The newspaper was linked to the northern part of New Jersey, where the perpetrator may have had ties. The bedspread in the suitcases had a reddish-orange color, was made of chenille fabric, and was wrapped around some of the body. It had yellow and pink embroidered flowers.\n\nAfter the body was found, the victim was fingerprinted. Her teeth were examined and recorded on a dental chart. Missing persons reports throughout the United States and Canada were compared at the time to the victim but were excluded.\n\nThe medical examiner noted that a set of numbers had been written on the victim's body. The ink, believed to have been from a pen, was on the left hand of the victim, indicating that she was right-handed if she had indeed written it herself. The writing consisted of the letters WSR and the number 4 or 5, followed by 4 or 7.\n\nHer fingerprints were submitted to the FBI, but they did not match anyone in national databases. When she remained unidentified, a sketch was made and the public was asked for assistance. This resulted in few solid leads. Information about the case was subsequently published across the country to generate leads.\n\nThe body was buried in 1983 after the victim remained unidentified for a number of years. In 2007, her remains were exhumed to obtain additional forensic evidence and to create a new facial reconstruction. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released two reconstructions, the latest in May 2015.\n\nEleven missing women have been excluded as a possible identity of Beth Doe:\n\n\nThe body was removed by authorities and transported in plastic bags to the nearby Gnadden Huetten Hospital for examination.\n\nAfter a three-hour autopsy on December 23, 1976, it was determined that she was a white woman in her late teens or early twenties. However, her identity could not be established. The cause of death was determined to be that of strangulation, although she had been shot in the neck as well.\n\nBeth Doe was between 4 feet 11 inches and 5 feet 4 inches tall. She weighed 140 to 150 pounds (due to her pregnancy). Her hair, which was shoulder-length, was an undyed dark brown. The medical examiner classified her blood as type O.\n\nShe had some distinctive markings on her body. A 2- to 6-inch scar was visible above one of her heels. Two moles on her face - one above her left eye and one on her left cheek - may have developed during her pregnancy.\n\nBefore becoming a teen, some of her molars had been extracted, and she had received fillings in her teeth. No false teeth were in place. Despite the evidence of previous care, she had likely not seen a dentist in some time, as she was suffering from severe tooth decay. One of her front incisors had a visible fracture, which was noted to likely cause severe pain.\n\nIt is believed that she was probably born in Europe and moved to the United States before reaching her teenage years, as examination of her tooth enamel indicated. An initial anthropological examination indicated she may have originated from Serbia or Croatia. Isotope testing was conducted on her hair, teeth, and bones.

{"id": "2227304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2227304", "title": "Beverage function", "text": "Beverage function\n\nIn catering, beverage functions are functions where beverages are served.\n\nOne important issue of beverage functions is who pays for the drinks. There are three main scenarios:\n\nChoosing among the several options is influenced by several factors. One such factor is etiquette. Providing a cash bar at a function such as a wedding reception is generally considered poor etiquette in the United States.\n\nAnother such factor is cost. A cash bar is the least expensive option for a host. However, there are alternatives between a cash bar and a fully open bar that can limit costs. The host can set a hard limit on cost, beyond which all beverages have to be paid for by attendees. The host can specify that specific beverages, such as a few selected types of wines and beers, are paid for by the host, and that attendees pay for all other types of drinks. The host can set a time limit for an open bar, beyond which it reverts to being a cash bar. Or more complex combinations of these can be employed.\n\nSome venues, such as hotels, subject to the terms of their liquor licenses, may allow attendees to bring their own alcoholic drinks to beverage functions. However, they may also charge attendees a fee, usually charged per bottle (either at a flat rate or as a percentage of the bottle's price), for doing so, known as corkage.\n\nCash bars have their problems for caterers and venue managers. One major problem is the possibility of theft. To prevent this, managers can set up cashiers, who take money and issue drinks tickets, separate from the serving staff who actually serve drinks. Brown and Godsmark recommend to managers that they place only their most trustworthy staff in charge of the cash bars at banquets.\n\nConversely, open bars have problems for hosts, in that they can result in an increased number of intoxicated, and potentially obnoxious and aggressive, attendees, as compared to other options. With open bars, the level of waste also increases (which is reflected in increased costs to the host). Since attendees do not pay for their drinks, they often do not consider them to be as valuable as they would if they had paid for them themselves. This results in drinks being abandoned or forgotten, or simply discarded by guests who leave their drinks (as they go and do something else) after only partly consuming them and then replace them with fresh ones rather than finishing the drinks that they already had.\n\nThe types of drinks served at functions can vary, according to the type of the event, and the types and ages of the attendees. In particular, at wedding receptions whether the bride and groom are themselves alcohol drinkers can affect whether attendees pay for their own alcoholic drinks, or indeed whether alcohol is offered at all. Similarly, alcohol is not served at beverage events for children.\n\nAnother factor that affects whether alcohol is served is liability, for subsequent intoxication and anything that results from it. Many U.S. jurisdictions allow the victims of accidents to sue not only the person who was intoxicated, but also the person who served the alcohol, the person or company employing the bartender, and the board of directors of the company.\n\n"}

As well as film screenings, the festival hosts parties and the CFC's annual picnic.\n\nThe WSFF holds accreditation, and is recognized as a qualifying event for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) short film awards. This means that certain award-winners at the WSFF are eligible to be nominated for the Oscars, Genies, and BAFTAs awards.\n\nIn 2012, the festival received 4,768 submissions from 113 countries, and it is currently the largest short film festival in North America. The festival has been described in the \"Canadian Encyclopedia\" as \"a popular and productive meeting place for audiences, filmmakers, buyers and sellers interested in the art and commerce of making movies in short form\", and this is reflected in the Short Films Big Ideas Symposium, which features master classes and panel discussions focused on professional development for those involved in the industry.\n\nEach year the festival offers a celebrity program which has, in the past, featured films with such notables as Scott Thompson, Judi Dench, David Duchovny, Michael Fassbender, Max von Sydow, Natalie Portman, Dick Van Dyke, Don Cheadle, Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Crispin Glover, Gérard Depardieu, Stephen Fry, and Anthony Hopkins, among others. The festival has also had films screen by many notable directors and celebrities, including Errol Morris, Spike Jonze, Rachel Weisz, Talmage Cooley, Courteney Cox, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In addition to the annual screenings in June, the festival also runs a monthly screening series called A World of Shorts.\nThe Worldwide Short Film Festival was founded in 1994, and operated independently under the direction of Brenda Sherwood until 2000, when the Festival was acquired by the Canadian Film Centre (CFC). The Centre brought some professional expertise to the venture: Wayne Clarkson, the CFC's executive director, who was the former head of the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), from 1978 to 1985.\n\nBrenda Sherwood was replaced as festival director by Shane Smith (2000-2006). Sherwood continued to serve on the festival advisory committee for 2001 festival season. Since 2001, under the direction of Shane Smith, the CFC-WSFF attendance doubled to over 15,000, and submissions increased to over 4,200. The CFC-WSFF also hosts the largest digital marketplace for short films in North America.\n\nSeveral CFC-WSFF juried short films went on to be nominated for Academy Awards. A few, like Chris Landreth's animated documentary \"Ryan\", won the 2004 Oscar for Best Animated Short Film, and the 25th Genie Award for Best Animated Short. Other Oscar winners include \"Harvie Krumpet\" by Adam Elliot (2003), \"Wasp\" by Andrea Arnold (2004) and \"The Danish Poet\" by Torill Kove (2006).\n\nFrom 2004-to-2006, Festival Director Shane Smith, and festival researcher Peter Hasek pursued the idea of curating a 45-minute presentation of large format IMAX 15/70mm short films. This presentation was to have been screened at one of the IMAX theaters in downtown Toronto, as part of the CFC-WSFF program. The effort had support from Kodak Canada and the English Animation Department of the National Film Board of Canada. The event was to be promoted with tongue-in-cheek, but in actual fact, as \"the only presentation at the Worldwide Short Film Festival that actually uses film.\"\n\nWith only a dozen-or-so 15/70mm short films in existence, the long-term plan was to create a boutique distribution service and \"circuit\" for large format short films; with each festival offering its own pro-rated \"audience choice\" cash award system. The goal was to create a reliable source of income for large format short film makers.\n\nThe \"debut screening\" of the 15/70mm large format short film platter was to have been held during the Worldwide Short Film Festival, at one of the IMAX theaters in downtown Toronto in June, 2006 followed by a screening for the Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival, at the Science North IMAX Theater in Sudbury, Ontario in September, 2006. \nFollowing these two festival screenings, the 15/70mm platter was destined for on-going, for-profit screenings at the Western Fair IMAX Theater in London, Ontario in exchange for their help with the project. The Western Fair IMAX projection room and other facilities were to be used for \"print traffic\" co-ordination and \"revision work\" needed to assemble a 45-minute presentation of 15/70mm short films.\n\nThere were tentative plans for screening this \"ad hoc\" platter of 15/70mm short films at other IMAX theaters in Canada, and the United States, wherever the local IMAX theater had a strong partnership with their local, mainstream film festival that was similar to the working arrangement and relationship between the Cinéfest group and Science North, in Sudbury, Ontario.\n\nThis plan fell-through over time when: (1) the Western Fair IMAX Theater in London, Ontario ceased operations in September 2005, (2) the IMAX theaters in downtown Toronto wanted up-to $2000/hour in theater rental fees to prepare and host a 15/70mm short film festival event, making the event unrealistic and unaffordable for CFC-WSFF organizers and patrons, respectively. And neither the Famous Players IMAX in downtown Toronto or the Cinesphere IMAX at Ontario Place was willing or able to provide print maintenance and on-site storage (Most entries to the Worldwide Short Film Festival (WSFF), or any film festival, are submitted on CD-ROM or DVD. A reel or platter of large format (IMAX) 70mm 15-perf short films featured at the WSFF can weigh 100 kilograms or more, and require the use of a forklift truck to move the 70mm film platter from the shipping dock, to the storage room, to the projection room.) for the duration of the project (April–June 2006), (3) IMAX corporate office in Santa Monica, California let it be known, throughout the \"IMAX theater network\", that the corporation did not support the idea of a large format, 15/70mm short film circuit for its theaters, and that the corporations current \"priority (circa 2004-05) was the 're-purposing' of mainstream Hollywood feature films for use in IMAX theaters (\"and that\") promoting short films in IMAX theaters would be a distraction\" from that goal, and that IMAX had its own vision of what constituted an \"IMAX film festival\" that involved its theaters, (An IMAX-sanctioned \"film festival\" consists of several existing IMAX feature films being packaged and sold to patrons at a deep discount. The Worldwide Short Film Festival conventional film festival model \"might\" compete-with or distract-from IMAX Corporations marketing-oriented film festival model.) (4) the loss of WSFF Director Shane Smith, who was the principal supporter of the idea of screening large format, 15/70mm short films at mainstream film festivals and, (5) festival researcher Peter Hasek was diagnosed with cancer.\n\nIn the end, it was determined that the scope and human resource requirements of The LF Project was so wide and deep, it would require the formation of a separate, double bottom line non-profit organization in order to fully develop, implement and maintain \"the goal\", set forth by Shane Smith and Peter Hasek, of curating a traveling presentation of IMAX short films that is both manageable and financially sustainable.\n\nShane Smith retired as festival director of the CFC-WSFF after the 2006 festival season, and was replaced by former print traffic coordinator, Eileen Arandiga, who is currently the Director of Partnerships and Events at the Canadian Film Centre. Shane Smith is currently the Toronto Film Festival's Director of Special Projects.\n\nIn early 2013, the Canadian Film Centre began a re-evaluation of its public activities. As part of this re-evaluation process, the CFC Worldwide Short Film Festival was put on hiatus.\n\nUp until the 2012 film festival season, and the 2013 hiatus, the Canadian Film Centre's Worldwide Short Film Festival offered two Academy-accredited awards. Winners of the Best Animated Short award and the Deluxe Award for Best Live-Action Short qualify to be nominated for an Oscar. From 2001-to-2012, the following short films were screened at the Worldwide Short Film Festival, and were later nominated for an Oscar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

On 22 November, her body was found in the woods between the towns of Mierlo and Lierop.\n\nIn 2011, Van den Hurk's stepbrother confessed to the killing, but was released a month later due to lack of evidence; he later said he had falsely confessed to get her body exhumed for DNA tests. DNA collected from the girl's exhumed remains and from the crime scene led to the arrest of a man (who was referred to only as Jos de G. () in news reports) in January 2014. Charged with rape and manslaughter, De G. was acquitted of manslaughter but found guilty of rape in November 2016, and was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. After the public prosecution appealed against the acquittal, De G. was convicted of manslaughter and his sentence was increased to twelve years.\n\nNicole van den Hurk was born on 4 July 1980 in Erkelenz, Germany, to a single mother. A few years later, they moved to the Netherlands together with the mother's Dutch boyfriend, who then married her. In 1989, Van den Hurk's mother and stepfather divorced with the stepfather winning custody of her. In April 1995, the mother committed suicide in Tilburg. At the time of her disappearance, Van den Hurk was staying at her grandmother's house in Tongelre.\n\nVan den Hurk left her grandmother's house in the early hours of Friday, 6 October 1995, and cycled towards , where she was working a holiday job; she never arrived. At 18:00 that day, police found her bicycle in the river Dommel. Between then and 17 October, the police searched the river and a nearby forest, and on 19 October, her rucksack was found near Eindhoven's canal; the canal and its south bank were searched the following day. Between 28 and 29 October, these areas were searched again. Her stepfather denied the hypothesis that she had run away to Germany, where her extended family lived. By 20 November, police had received around 300 leads.\n\nOn Wednesday, 22 November, a passerby found Van den Hurk's body in the woods between Mierlo and Lierop. Her funeral on 28 November was attended by some one thousand mourners. Her post-mortem showed she had suffered two fractures to the jaw, other injuries to the head and fingers, and a rib injury caused by stabbing.\n\nOn 24 October 1995, an anonymous caller told police he could identify the killer, but the call ended prematurely. The recording of the call was broadcast on national television in January 1996 in an attempt to trace the caller. Later, the team of detectives was reduced to four. In February, a friend of Van den Hurk's family arrested for drug trafficking told police that she had been forced to smuggle heroin by men involved in the killing. The police said her story was flawed and was of no help. Meanwhile, \"Passie\" magazine offered a reward for details about the killer. Between May and June, Van den Hurk's stepbrother and stepfather were arrested in connection with the killing, and then cleared.\n\nIn 2004, a cold case team investigated the killing to no avail. By 2011, Van den Hurk's stepbrother Andy had moved to England. On 8 March, he confessed to the killing in a Facebook post, and was arrested by British police. He was extradited to the Netherlands on 30 March, but was released five days later as the Facebook post was the only evidence against him. Later, Andy retracted his confession, saying that he believed his father was the culprit; in 2016, he said in an interview that he had falsely confessed to the killing in order to revive attention to her death and get her body exhumed for DNA testing.\n\nVan den Hurk's remains were exhumed in September 2011 to allow DNA samples to be obtained. On the same day, the reward for the killer's details was increased from 25,000 guilders to €15,000. Within a week, the police announced that foreign DNA had been found on the remains and had received more than twenty new leads. In January 2014, the police arrested a 46-year-old man identified as Jos de G. after his DNA matched samples found on the remains and at the crime scene. De G. had previously been convicted of three rapes, being sentenced to three years preventive detention and compulsory treatment for one of them. He was known to have left his ex-girlfriend's home after a fight a few hours before Van den Hurk's disappearance.\n\nWhen the case first came to court in April 2014, De G.'s lawyer disputed the DNA evidence, as DNA from other people, including Van den Hurk's ex-boyfriend, was also found on her remains; he argued she may have had consensual sex with De G., had had multiple sexual partners, and may have been pregnant when she died. In July, the murder charge against De G. was dropped in favor of manslaughter and rape charges. At another hearing in October 2015, De G. denied contact with Van den Hurk at the time of her disappearance, but said he may have had consensual sex with her a few days earlier.\n\nDe G.'s trial began on 2 November 2015. Prosecution experts testified to the DNA evidence. Later in the month, the trial was suspended for two weeks during investigation into a witness's statement that De G. had confessed to killing a girl. In a later interview, the witness and another person said De G. had made this confession while the three were in a mental institution together a decade earlier. De G.'s attorney argued this testimony was motivated by the €15,000 reward.\n\nA trace of semen containing DNA from at least three people—believed by prosecution experts to be De G., Van den Hurk's then-boyfriend and her stepbrother—had been found on Van den Hurk's remains. With experts disagreeing on the reliability of the sample, it was announced in March 2016 that scientists would re-analyse the DNA results using new methods. On 19 April, the court heard that it was 2.28 million times more likely than not that De G. was one of the people whose DNA was found on the remains.\n\nOn 12 October 2016, the prosecution demanded that De G. receive fourteen years' imprisonment, asserting that he could not have had consensual sex with Van den Hurk, arguing that she had no time for a relationship. On 21 November, De G. was found guilty of rape and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. In determining the penalty, the court took into account the finding that he was legally insane at the time of the crime. He was acquitted of manslaughter on the basis of the possibility that the person whose DNA was found on the remains who was not affirmatively identified was involved in van den Hurk's death.\n\nThe public prosecution appealed against De G.'s acquittal shortly after the trial ended. The appeal case began on 28 August 2018. On 29 August, the prosecution demanded a sentence of fourteen years' imprisonment, as they had done in the initial trial. On 9 October, the acquittal was overturned and De G. was sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment for the rape and manslaughter of Van den Hurk.\n\n"}
{"id": "27569843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27569843", "title": "Denial of Peter", "text": "Denial of Peter\n\nThe Denial of Peter (or Peter's Denial) refers to three acts of denial of Jesus by the Apostle Peter as described in all four Gospels of the New Testament.\n\nAll four Canonical Gospels state that during Jesus' Last Supper with his disciples, he predicted that Peter would deny knowledge of him, stating that Peter would disown him before the rooster crowed the next morning. Following the arrest of Jesus, Peter denied knowing him three times, but after the third denial, heard the rooster crow and recalled the prediction as Jesus turned to look at him. Peter then began to cry bitterly. This final incident is known as the Repentance of Peter.\n\nThe turbulent emotions behind Peter's denial and later repentance have been the subject of major works of art for centuries. Examples include Caravaggio's \"Denial of Saint Peter\", which is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The incidents have also inspired segments in various films related to the life and death of Jesus Christ (for instance, when Francesco De Vito performed as Peter in \"The Passion of the Christ\") as well as references in musical works, both religious and secular.\n\nThe prediction, made by Jesus during the Last Supper that Peter would deny and disown him, appears in the Gospel of Matthew , the Gospel of Mark , the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John . The denial accounts in the Gospels differ from each other.\n\nAccording to the Gospel of Matthew:\n\nPeter replied, \"Even if all fall away on account of you, I never will.\" \"I tell you the truth,\" Jesus answered, \"This very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" But Peter declared, \"Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.\" And all the other disciples said the same.\nLater that night, Jesus was arrested. The first denial to a servant girl in is as follows:\n\nThen they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest's house. Peter followed at a distance and when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together, Peter sat down with them. A servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight. She looked closely at him and said, \"This man was with him.\" But he denied it. \"Woman, I don't know him,\" he said.\nThe second denial to the same girl in is:\n\nWhen the servant girl saw him there, she said again to those standing around, \"This fellow is one of them.\" Again he denied it.\nThe third denial to a number of people, is emphatic as he curses according to :\n\nAfter a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, \"Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away.\" Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, \"I don't know the man!\" Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: \"Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly.\nThe Gospel of Luke describes the moment of the last denial as follows:\n\nAbout an hour later another asserted, \"Certainly this fellow was with him, for he is a Galilean.\" Peter replied, \"Man, I don't know what you're talking about!\" Just as he was speaking, the rooster crowed. The Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. Then Peter remembered the word the Lord had spoken to him: \"Before the rooster crows today, you will disown me three times.\" And he went outside and wept bitterly.\nThe Gospel of John describes the account of the three denials as follows:\n\nSimon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Because this disciple was known to the high priest, he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard, but Peter had to wait outside at the door. The other disciple, who was known to the high priest, came back, spoke to the girl on duty there and brought Peter in. \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" the girl at the door asked Peter. He replied, \"I am not.\" ... As Simon Peter stood warming himself, he was asked, \"You are not one of his disciples, are you?\" He denied it, saying, \"I am not.\" One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, challenged him, \"Didn't I see you with him in the olive grove?\" Again Peter denied it, and at that moment a rooster began to crow. \nFollowing the resurrection of Jesus, the Gospel of John narrates how Jesus asked Peter three times if Peter loved him, pointing to the rehabilitation of Peter following his repentance.\n\nFor much of the period of three years that Jesus spent in ministry, gathering and teaching disciples, he had been observed, criticised and harassed by scholars and priests. His teachings were sometimes seen as heretical and his actions in gathering a group of disciples as possibly having political motivation. Jesus' capture and trials were the culmination of this antipathy.\n\nPeter was one of the twelve disciples most closely associated with Jesus. His denials are made in the face of accusation that he was \"with Jesus\", the term indicating the bond of discipleship. The Gospel of Matthew states that Peter denied Jesus \"in front of everyone\", thus making a public witness, affirming this with an oath (). Throughout his Gospel, Matthew stresses the importance of public witness as an essential element of discipleship, stating in : \"Whoever acknowledges me before men, I will also acknowledge him before my Father in heaven. But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven.\" Peter's denial is in direct conflict with the nature of discipleship, as described by Matthew. Matthew has also previously reported Jesus' teaching forbidding the use of an oath:\n\nThe New Testament descriptions of Peter's denial depict the drama of the incident. Peter's antagonists in the discussion of his discipleship progress from a maid, to a maid plus a bystander, to a whole crowd. His denial progresses from a plea of ignorance, to a denial plus an oath and then to cursing and swearing with a total denial that he ever knew Jesus. The sound of the rooster then brings a shock to Peter that Jesus had predicted the three denials.\n\nThis episode has been seen as an incident that sheds light on the unique role of Peter and sets him apart from the other disciples, just as in the Gospel of Mark in which the angel tells the women to \"go and tell his disciples and Peter\" about the resurrection of Jesus. In this episode, as often elsewhere in the Gospel of Mark, Peter acts as the focus of the apostles, and an essential Christological image is presented: the denials of Peter contrast with the frank confessions of Jesus in his trial by the Sanhedrin, portraying his faithfulness as prophet, Son and Messiah.\n\nThe triple denial of Peter is the impetus for the three repetitive questions made by Jesus to Peter at the Sea of Galilee after His resurrection, \"Simon, son of John, Do you love me?\" Although originally interpreted by Peter as a rebuke for his three denials (also due to the use by Jesus of his old name \"Simon\"), this event became later viewed as a redemptive act by Jesus, allowing Peter to publicly declare in front of his fellow disciples that he truly did love his Lord and thus become fully restored to his faith community. ().\n\nThe triple denial is also echoed in Peter's triple refusal to eat the animals when he has a vision of a sheet with animals in Acts 10.\n\nThe three 'denials' are also present in a gnostic source, the Apocalypse of Peter from Nag Hammadi, but the roles are reversed in the context of meditation and seeing inner vision of the Master. In the gnostic Apocalypse of Peter, Jesus denies Peter \"three times in this night\" as not ready for inner sight, 72,5. Both details of \"three times\" denied and \"in this night\" being present suggests a relationship to the canonical portrayal of The Denial of Peter.\n\nBishop Lancelot Andrewes composed the following prayer:\n\nO Lord Jesus Christ, look upon us with those eyes of thine where-with thou dist look upon Peter in the hall; that with Peter we may repent and, by the same love be forgiven; for thine\nmercy's sake. Amen.\nReferring to the tears shed by Peter during his repentance in the context of the Sacrament of Penance, Saint Ambrose said \"in the Church, there are water and tears: the water of Baptism and the tears of repentance\". Traditionally, \"tears of repentance\", as exemplified by Peter, have become a symbol both of mourning and comfort: a sign at once of sins repented and forgiveness sought.\n\nIn the Scriptural Way of the Cross introduced in 1991 by Pope John Paul II as a version of the Stations of the Cross, and performed each Good Friday at the Colosseum in Rome, the fourth station is the \"Denial of Peter\".\n\nDuring Holy week in Jerusalem, vigils at times stop at a location traditionally considered the location for the \"Repentance of Peter\", not far from the house of the high priest Caiaphas, involved in the Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus.\n\nThe episode has been the subject of works of art for centuries. It has also been dramatized in musical settings of the Passion story. It has been depicted in a varieties of mediums and methods, ranging from 6th century mosaic at the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo to Russian icons and oil paintings by many old masters. The subject was sometimes included in cycles of the \"Life of Christ\" or the \"Passion\", often as the only scene not to include the figure of Christ.\n\nIn Rembrandt's depiction, now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, he presents the servant girl who recognizes Peter with a candle, illuminating Peter's face. Two soldiers look with suspicion as Peter speaks, while Jesus is shown in the distance, his hands bound behind him, turning to look at Peter. Peter's faces away from Jesus, and he gestures with his left hand, although his expression is free of defiance.\n\nCaravaggio's \"Denial of Saint Peter\" is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Author George Weatherhead admires Caravaggio's depiction, the way Peter exhibits a wavering trepidation in his unsteady features, conscious of the unworthy falsehood he was telling. His lips quiver and his eyes seek, yet can not find the firmness of truth. In this painting, Caravaggio portrayed the servant girl using the same head of the woman that he used in his depiction of \"The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist\".\n\nA related subject, the Repentance of Peter, showing the end of the episode, was not often seen before Catholic Counter-Reformation art, where it became popular as an assertion of the sacrament of Confession against Protestant attacks. This followed an influential book by the Jesuit Cardinal Robert Bellarmine (1542–1621). The image typically shows Peter in tears, as a half-length portrait with no other figures, often with hands clasped as at right, and sometimes the cock in the background; it was often coupled with a repentant Mary Magdalen, another exemplar from Bellarmine's book.\n\nThe Passion story has been set in music by numerous composers. The episode of Peter's denial is conveyed with great poignancy by J.S.Bach in both the \"St Matthew Passion\" and the \"St John Passion\". John Eliot Gardiner (2013, p. 365) says \"Inevitably we suffer with Peter; but the uncomfortable question Bach asks us to consider is, would any of us have emerged from his ordeal with greater credit?. In the same way, the band Thrice wrote a cinematic piece called Like Moth to Flames, with the lyrics written from the point of view of Peter.\n\nJames Ralph Boyd of Los Angeles, California, in 2016 composed \"A Song of Remorse - St. Peter's Denial of Jesus Three Times,\" which is depicted in HD video. Mr. Boyd's vocal rendition is syncopated with piano arpeggios that gradually ascend various octaves, juxtaposed with cellos and a solo violin. The lyrics are based on the Gospel of St. Luke 22:31-34, \"Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded to sift you like wheat. . .\"\n\n\n"}

It is one of the programs established by FIRST.\n\nFIRST LEGO League Jr. follows the same theme given to FIRST LEGO League. While FIRST LEGO League Jr. teams conduct research projects and design autonomous robots specifically to carry out missions relating to the topic, FIRST LEGO League Jr. teams conduct much smaller projects and makes models out of LEGO elements to illustrate one part of the theme. They may also use LEGO WeDo, a programmable robotics kit, as part of their models.\n\nCurrently, the program is available in 33 countries.\n\nFIRST LEGO League Jr. League started out as a pilot program in 2004 to encourage young children to have interest in science and engineering. In the first pilot year, the teams were provided with some specific LEGO parts by FIRST, but that idea was dropped in later years. Teams now use any LEGO elements that they have to build the models. The pilot years were done in three phases from 2004 to 2006. The program was officially launched in 2007 during the Power Puzzle season.\n\nDuring the first five years, the program was not referred as a robotic program. The only requirements to build models out of LEGO elements were to have some moving parts and include at least one simple machine based on a given topic of that year. FIRST has provided an option to purchase a FIRST LEGO League Jr. Base Kit that contains many LEGO elements including gears, motor, and other TECHNIC elements. In 2009, with the new robotics kit by LEGO Group, the program included LEGO WeDo as an optional kit which allows children to connect a motor and/or a sensor to other LEGO bricks, gears and other TECHNIC elements. It also has drag-and-drop programming interface for children to write robotics programs.\n\nThe number of participants has been increasing each year. However, the program was limited to the United States and Canada until 2009.\n\nFIRST LEGO League Jr. is designed to be a non-competitive and community-based program. The teams are formed within local community and participate in local events. FIRST provides guidelines to help coaches to run their teams and local organizers to run FIRST LEGO League Jr. events. However, FIRST does not organize any FIRST LEGO League Jr. event, unlike other FIRST programs.\n\nThe program is designed to be flexible; there are no specific dates for the program. Each team may decide when to start the activities and for how long as long as the registration is done within the season calendar which is from August to June each year. A team consists of 2-6 team members. There is an age limit that team members must not be older than 9 as of January 1 of the year the Challenge is released. Although there is no lower bound on age, FIRST suggests that the program is intended for children 6 or older.\n\nAfter registering a team, the coach guides students to do research by following the Challenge guideline. The team may have a field trip or visit experts to help children to learn more about the topic. Children will then work on their \"Show Me\" poster and LEGO models to demonstrate their findings according to the instructions in the Challenge. The team may choose to use any LEGO parts that they have at home to construct their models. Optionally, the team may purchase FIRST LEGO League Jr. Base Kit or LEGO WeDo Kit to use.\n\nThe FIRST LEGO League Jr. challenges align with the research project portion of FIRST LEGO League .\n\nThe program encourages teams to go out and tell their story to others after they have completed the poster and the models. They may participate in one of the well-established FIRST LEGO League Jr. events, which are typically part of FIRST LEGO League tournaments run by independent FIRST LEGO League partners. Most of these events are called 'FIRST LEGO League Jr. Expos'. Alternately, they may host their own event in the neighborhood or at school to showcase their accomplishment.\n\nAt the FIRST LEGO League Jr. event, there will be \"Reviewers\" (the judges) to ask children some questions about what they have learned. They may be asked details about the project and the models that they built. The FIRST LEGO League Jr.concept is that everyone is a winner, therefore, the event organizers are recommended to give an award to each team that participates in the event.\n\nThe organizers can create any list of awards. Below is the list of awards suggested by FIRST:\n\nSince the inception of the program, FIRST LEGO League Jr. events have been held by local organizers or official FIRST LEGO League partners in the participating countries, but not by FIRST organization. Recently, FIRST has held an annual event called 'FIRST LEGO League Jr. World Festival Expo' each year in St. Louis, Missouri as part of the FIRST Championship, but the program is still relies on almost one hundred events of local organizers throughout the year.\n\n"}

The story is based on the death of Floyd Collins near Cave City, Kentucky in the winter of 1925. The musical opened Off-Broadway on February 9, 1996, where it ran for 25 performances. There have been subsequent London productions as well as regional U.S. productions.\n\n\"Floyd Collins\" premiered at the American Music Theater Festival, in Philadelphia, in 1994.\n\nThe show opened Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons, New York City, on February 9, 1996 and closed on March 24, 1996 after 25 performances. Directed by Landau, the cast included Christopher Innvar as Floyd Collins, Martin Moran as Skeets Miller, Jason Danieley as Homer Collins, and Theresa McCarthy as Nellie Collins, as well as Cass Morgan, Brian d'Arcy James, Matthew (Matt) Bennett and Michael Mulheren. The musical won the Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Musical, and the 1995-1996 Obie Award for its score. In 2003, a reunion concert was held at Playwrights Horizons with Romain Frugé as Floyd Collins and most of the original cast. \n\nAfter a three-stop mini US tour in 1999, including San Diego's Old Globe Theatre, Chicago's Goodman Theatre, and Philadelphia's American Music Theatre Festival, where it had first premiered; the show had its first independent regional production at New Line Theatre in St. Louis, MO in November 1999.\n\nThe show made its London debut at the Bridewell Theatre in July 1999, with Nigel Richards as Floyd, Anna Francolini as Nellie and Craig Parnell as Homer. The production was directed by Clive Paget. A London revival was produced at The Vault, Southwark Playhouse in February and March 2012. The production was directed by Derek Bond, with Glenn Carter as Floyd, Robyn North as Nellie, Gareth Chart as Homer and Ryan Sampson as Skeets. The production was produced by Peter Huntley and was long-listed for the Ned Sherrin Award for Best Musical at the Evening Standard Awards and won Best Musical Production at the 'Offies'the Off-West-End Awards. A Chicago revival was produced at BoHo Theatre in June and July 2012. The production was directed by Peter Marston Sullivan, with Jim DeSelm as Floyd, Jon Harrison as Homer, and Sarah Bockel as Nellie. \"Floyd Collins\" had its North Carolina regional premiere in August 2011 at the Carolina Actors Studio Theatre in Charlotte.\n\nThe finale song is the title track of Audra McDonald's 2000 album \"How Glory Goes\", and was also included on Brian Stokes Mitchell's 2006 self-titled album.\n\nIn June 2015, the production premiered at the Ophelia Theater in Astoria, NY. The production was directed by the Artistic Director of Ophelia Theatre Group and features an intimate and immersive staging within a newly renovated black box space. \n\nAs originally written, the character list included Floyd Collins, Homer Collins, Nellie Collins, and Johnnie Gerald; as rewritten the role of Johnnie Gerald was merged with that of Homer Collins. As currently performed, the roles include Bee Doyle, Dr Hazlett, three reporters, a Con Man, Lee Collins, Homer Collins, Floyd Collins, Clif Rony, Jewlle Estes, Nellie Collins, Skeets Miller, Miss Jane, H. T. Carmichael and Ed Bishop.\n\nFloyd Collins, exploring Sand Cave, uses the echoes of his voice to sound out the region, and falls through a tight passageway when his foot became trapped, wedged in position by a small rock. His family and his fellow cavers try to free him; when it becomes clear that his rescue will not be easy, his brother Homer spends the night in the cave with him. William Burke \"Skeets\" Miller, a small man, is able to squeeze through and visit with Floyd, relaying stories which were printed in the news.\nDespite efforts by miners, the National Guard and the Red Cross, attempts at rescue fail, and the crowd grows outside the cave as a media circus ensues.\n\nSeventeen days after Floyd had entered the cave, a shaft finally reaches him. He had died three days earlier.\n\nThe play's musical style is drawn from bluegrass, Americana, and \"more complex musical forms that have their antecedents in the likes of Bartok, Janacek and Stravinsky\".\n\n\nDespite having a run of only 25 performances, the show left a strong impression on contemporary theatre. John Simon, writing for \"New York Magazine\", proclaimed that Floyd Collins was \"\"the\" original and daring musical of our day.\" He also wrote that \"Floyd Collins reestablishes America's sovereignty in a genre it created, but has since lost hold of: it is the modern musical's true and exhilarating ace in the hole.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" wrote that \"Mr. Guettel establishes himself as a young composer of strength and sophistication.\"\n\nThe original cast recording was released on Nonesuch on March 18, 1997.\n\nThe following songs are not included on the recording: \n\n"}
{"id": "137840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=137840", "title": "Great Purge", "text": "Great Purge\n\nThe Great Purge or the Great Terror was a campaign of political repression in the Soviet Union which occurred from 1936 to 1938. It involved a large-scale purge of the Communist Party and government officials, repression of wealthy landlords and the Red Army leadership, widespread police surveillance, suspicion of saboteurs, counter-revolutionaries, imprisonment, and arbitrary executions. In Russian historiography, the period of the most intense purge, 1937–1938, is called Yezhovshchina (literally, \"Yezhov phenomenon\", commonly translated as \"times of Yezhov\" or \"doings of Yezhov\"), after Nikolai Yezhov, the head of the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, who was executed a year after the purge. Mobile gas vans were used to execute people without trial. Modern historical studies estimate the total number of deaths due to Stalinist repression in 1937–38 to be between 950,000 and 1,200,000.\n\nIn the Western world, Robert Conquest's 1968 book \"The Great Terror\" popularized that phrase. Conquest's title was in turn an allusion to the period called the Reign of Terror during the French Revolution (French: \"la Terreur\", and, from June to July 1794, \"la Grande Terreur\", the Great Terror).\n\nThe term \"repression\" was officially used to describe the prosecution of people considered counter-revolutionaries and enemies of the people by the leadership of the Soviet Union at the time, Joseph Stalin. The purge was motivated by the desire to remove dissenters from the Communist Party and to consolidate the authority of Stalin. Most public attention was focused on the purge of certain parts of the leadership of the Communist Party, as well as of government bureaucrats and leaders of the armed forces, most of whom were Party members. The campaigns also affected many other categories of the society: intelligentsia, peasants and especially those branded as \"too rich for a peasant\" (kulaks), and professionals. A series of NKVD operations affected a number of national minorities, accused of being \"fifth column\" communities. A number of purges were officially explained as an elimination of the possibilities of sabotage and espionage, by the Polish Military Organisation and, consequently, many victims of the purge were ordinary Soviet citizens of Polish origin.\n\nAccording to Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 speech, \"On the Cult of Personality and its Consequences,\" and Robert Conquest, a great number of accusations, notably those presented at the Moscow show trials, were based on forced confessions, often obtained through torture, and on loose interpretations of Article 58 of the RSFSR Penal Code, which dealt with counter-revolutionary crimes. Due legal process, as defined by Soviet law in force at the time, was often largely replaced with summary proceedings by NKVD troikas.\n\nHundreds of thousands of victims were accused of various political crimes (espionage, wrecking, sabotage, anti-Soviet agitation, conspiracies to prepare uprisings and coups); they were quickly executed by shooting, or sent to the Gulag labor camps. Many died at the penal labor camps of starvation, disease, exposure, and overwork. Other methods of dispatching victims were used on an experimental basis. Some secret policemen, for example, gassed people to death in batches in the back of a specially adapted airtight van.\n\nThe Great Purge began under NKVD chief Genrikh Yagoda, but reached its peak between September 1936 and August 1938 under the leadership of Nikolai Yezhov, hence the name \"Yezhovshchina\". The campaigns were carried out according to the general line, often by direct orders of the Party Politburo headed by Stalin.\n\nFrom 1930 onwards, the Party and police officials feared the \"social disorder\" caused by the upheavals of forced collectivization of peasants and the resulting famine of 1932–1933, as well as the massive and uncontrolled migration of millions of peasants into cities. The threat of war heightened Stalin's perception of marginal and politically suspect populations as the potential source of an uprising in case of invasion. He began to plan for the preventive elimination of such potential recruits for a mythical \"fifth column of wreckers, terrorists and spies.\" (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003).\nThe term \"purge\" in Soviet political slang was an abbreviation of the expression \"purge of the Party ranks\". In 1933, for example, the Party expelled some 400,000 people. But from 1936 until 1953, the term changed its meaning, because being expelled from the Party came to mean almost certain arrest, imprisonment, and often execution.\n\nThe political purge was primarily an effort by Stalin to eliminate challenge from past and potential opposition groups, including the left and right wings led by Leon Trotsky and Nikolai Bukharin, respectively. Following the Civil War and reconstruction of the Soviet economy in the late 1920s, veteran Bolsheviks no longer thought necessary the \"temporary\" wartime dictatorship, which had passed from Lenin to Stalin. Stalin's opponents on both sides of the political spectrum chided him as undemocratic and lax on bureaucratic corruption. This opposition to current leadership may have accumulated substantial support among the working class by attacking the privileges and luxuries the state offered to its high-paid elite. The Ryutin Affair seemed to vindicate Stalin's suspicions. He enforced a ban on party factions and banned those party members who had opposed him, effectively ending democratic centralism.\n\nIn the new form of Party organization, the Politburo, and Stalin in particular, were the sole dispensers of ideology. This required the elimination of all Marxists with different views, especially those among the prestigious \"old guard\" of revolutionaries. As the purges began, the government (through the NKVD) shot Bolshevik heroes, including Mikhail Tukhachevsky and Béla Kun, as well as the majority of Lenin's Politburo, for disagreements in policy. The NKVD attacked the supporters, friends, and family of these \"heretical\" Marxists, whether they lived in Russia or not. The NKVD nearly annihilated Trotsky's family before killing him in Mexico; the NKVD agent Ramón Mercader was part of an assassination task force put together by Special Agent Pavel Sudoplatov, under the personal orders of Stalin.\nIn 1934, Stalin used the murder of Sergey Kirov as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished (see ). Some later historians came to believe that Stalin arranged the murder, or at least that there was sufficient evidence to reach such a conclusion. Kirov was a staunch Stalin loyalist, but Stalin may have viewed him as a potential rival because of his emerging popularity among the moderates. The 1934 Party Congress elected Kirov to the central committee with only three votes against, the fewest of any candidate, while Stalin received 292 votes against. After Kirov's assassination, the NKVD charged the former oppositionists, an ever-growing group according to their determination, with Kirov's murder as well as a growing list of other offences, including treason, terrorism, sabotage, and espionage.\n\nAnother justification for the purge was to remove any possible \"fifth column\" in case of a war. Vyacheslav Molotov and Lazar Kaganovich, participants in the repression as members of the Politburo, maintained this justification throughout the purge; they each signed many death lists. Stalin believed war was imminent, threatened both by an explicitly hostile Germany and an expansionist Japan. The Soviet press portrayed the country as threatened from within by fascist spies.\nFrom the October Revolution onward, Lenin had used repression against perceived enemies of the Bolsheviks as a systematic method of instilling fear and facilitating social control, especially during the campaign commonly referred to as the Red Terror. This policy continued and intensified under Stalin, periods of heightened repression including the deportation of kulaks who opposed collectivization, and a severe famine in Ukraine. A distinctive feature of the Great Purge was that, for the first time, members of the ruling party were included on a massive scale as victims of the repression. Due to the scale of the terror, the substantial victims of the purges were Communist Party members and office-holders. The purge of the Party was accompanied by the purge of the whole society. The following events are used for the demarcation of the period.\n\n\nBetween 1936 and 1938, three very large Moscow Trials of former senior Communist Party leaders were held, in which they were accused of conspiring with fascist and capitalist powers to assassinate Stalin and other Soviet leaders, dismember the Soviet Union and restore capitalism. These trials were highly publicized and extensively covered by the outside world, which was mesmerized by the spectacle of Lenin's closest associates confessing to most outrageous crimes and begging for death sentences.\n\nSome Western observers who attended the trials said that they were fair and that the guilt of the accused had been established. They based this assessment on the confessions of the accused, which were freely given in open court, without any apparent evidence that they had been extracted by torture or drugging. The British lawyer and Member of Parliament D.N. Pritt, for example, wrote: \"Once again the more faint-hearted socialists are beset with doubts and anxieties\", but \"once again we can feel confident that when the smoke has rolled away from the battlefield of controversy it will be realized that the charge was true, the confessions correct and the prosecution fairly conducted\".\n\nIt is now known that the confessions were given only after great psychological pressure and torture had been applied to the defendants. From the accounts of former OGPU officer Alexander Orlov and others, the methods used to extract the confessions are known: such tortures as repeated beatings, simulated drownings, making prisoners stand or go without sleep for days on end, and threats to arrest and execute the prisoners' families. For example, Kamenev's teenage son was arrested and charged with terrorism. After months of such interrogation, the defendants were driven to despair and exhaustion.\n\nZinoviev and Kamenev demanded, as a condition for \"confessing\", a direct guarantee from the Politburo that their lives and that of their families and followers would be spared. This offer was accepted, but when they were taken to the alleged Politburo meeting, only Stalin, Kliment Voroshilov, and Yezhov were present. Stalin claimed that they were the \"commission\" authorized by the Politburo and gave assurances that death sentences would not be carried out. After the trial, Stalin not only broke his promise to spare the defendants, he had most of their relatives arrested and shot.\n\nIn May 1937, the Commission of Inquiry into the Charges Made against Leon Trotsky in the Moscow Trials, commonly known as the Dewey Commission, was set up in the United States by supporters of Trotsky, to establish the truth about the trials. The commission was headed by the noted American philosopher and educator John Dewey. Although the hearings were obviously conducted with a view to proving Trotsky's innocence, they brought to light evidence which established that some of the specific charges made at the trials could not be true.\n\nFor example, Georgy Pyatakov testified that he had flown to Oslo in December 1935 to \"receive terrorist instructions\" from Trotsky. The Dewey Commission established that no such flight had taken place. Another defendant, Ivan Smirnov, confessed to taking part in the assassination of Sergei Kirov in December 1934, at a time when he had already been in prison for a year.\n\nThe Dewey Commission later published its findings in a 422-page book titled \"Not Guilty\". Its conclusions asserted the innocence of all those condemned in the Moscow Trials. In its summary, the commission wrote: \"Independent of extrinsic evidence, the Commission finds:\n\nThe commission concluded: \"We therefore find the Moscow Trials to be frame-ups.\"\n\nIn the second trial, Karl Radek provided (or more accurately was forced to provide) the pretext for greater purge to come on a massive scale with his testimony that there was a \"third organization separate from the cadres which had passed through [Trotsky's] school\" as well as \"semi-Trotskyites, quarter-Trotskyites, one-eighth-Trotskyites, people who helped us, not knowing of the terrorist organization but sympathizing with us, people who from liberalism, from a Fronde against the Party, gave us this help.\"\n\nBy the \"third organization\", he meant the last remaining former opposition group called the Rightists, led by Bukharin, whom he implicated by saying:\n\nThe third and final trial, in March 1938, known as The Trial of the Twenty-One, is the most famous of the Soviet show trials, because of persons involved and the scope of charges which tied together all loose threads from earlier trials. Meant to be the culmination of previous trials, it included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called \"Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites\", led by Nikolai Bukharin, the former chairman of the Communist International, former premier Alexei Rykov, Christian Rakovsky, Nikolai Krestinsky and Genrikh Yagoda, recently disgraced head of the NKVD.\n\nThe fact that Yagoda was one of the accused showed the speed at which the purges were consuming their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder Maxim Gorky by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and hand her territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges.\n\nEven previously sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it harder to swallow these new allegations as they became ever more absurd, and the purge expanded to include almost every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. No other crime of the Stalin years so captivated Western intellectuals as the trial and execution of Bukharin, who was a Marxist theorist of international standing. For some prominent communists such as Bertram Wolfe, Jay Lovestone, Arthur Koestler, and Heinrich Brandler, the Bukharin trial marked their final break with communism, and even turned the first three into fervent anti-Communists eventually. To them, Bukharin's confession symbolized the\ndepredations of communism, which not only destroyed its sons but also conscripted them in self-destruction and individual abnegation.\n\nThe preparation for this trial, which took over a year, was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades. It was at this time that Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with Yezhov.\n\nOn the first day of trial, Krestinsky caused a sensation when he repudiated his written confession and pleaded not guilty to all the charges. However, he changed his plea the next day after \"special measures\", which dislocated his left shoulder among other things.\n\nAnastas Mikoyan and Vyacheslav Molotov later claimed that Bukharin was never tortured, but it is now known that his interrogators were given the order, \"beating permitted,\" and were under great pressure to extract confession out of the \"star\" defendant. Bukharin initially held out for three months, but threats to his young wife and infant son, combined with \"methods of physical influence\" wore him down. But when he read his confession amended and corrected personally by Stalin, he withdrew his whole confession. The examination started all over again, with a double team of interrogators.\n\nBukharin's confession in particular became subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel \"Darkness at Noon\" and philosophical essay by Maurice Merleau-Ponty in \"Humanism and Terror\". His confessions were somewhat different from others in that while he pleaded guilty to \"sum total of crimes\", he denied knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Some astute observers noted that he would allow only what was in written confession and refuse to go any further.\n\nThe result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions (of being a \"degenerate fascist\" working for \"restoration of capitalism\") and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him, one observer noted that Bukharin \"proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case.\" He continued by saying that \"the confession of the accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence\" in a trial that was solely based on confessions, he finished his last plea with the words: \"the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all.\"\n\nRomain Rolland and others wrote to Stalin seeking clemency for Bukharin, but all the leading defendants were executed except Rakovsky and two others (who were killed in NKVD prisoner massacres in 1941). Despite the promise to spare his family, Bukharin's wife, Anna Larina, was sent to a labor camp, but she survived to see her husband rehabilitated by the Soviet state under Mikhail Gorbachev in 1988.\n\nThe purge of the Red Army and Military Maritime Fleet removed three of five marshals (then equivalent to five-star generals), 13 of 15 army commanders (then equivalent to three- and four-star generals), eight of nine admirals (the purge fell heavily on the Navy, who were suspected of exploiting their opportunities for foreign contacts), 50 of 57 army corps commanders, 154 out of 186 division commanders, 16 of 16 army commissars, and 25 of 28 army corps commissars.\n\nAt first it was thought 25–50% of Red Army officers had been purged; the true figure is now known to be in the area of 3.7–7.7%. This discrepancy was the result of a systematic underestimation of the true size of the Red Army officer corps, and it was overlooked that most of those purged were merely expelled from the Party. Thirty percent of officers purged in 1937–39 were allowed to return to service.\n\nThe purge of the army was claimed to be supported by German-forged documents (said to have been correspondence between Marshal Tukhachevsky and members of the German high command). The claim is unsupported by facts, as by the time the documents were supposedly created, two people from the eight in the Tukhachevsky group were already imprisoned, and by the time the document was said to reach Stalin the purging process was already underway. However the actual evidence introduced at trial was obtained from forced confessions.\n\nEventually almost all of the Bolsheviks who had played prominent roles during the Russian Revolution of 1917, or in Lenin's Soviet government, were executed. Out of six members of the original Politburo during the 1917 October Revolution who lived until the Great Purge, Stalin himself was the only one who remained in the Soviet Union, alive. Four of the other five were executed. The fifth, Leon Trotsky, had been forced into exile outside the Soviet Union in 1929, but was assassinated in Mexico by Soviet agent Ramón Mercader in 1940. Of the seven members elected to the Politburo between the October Revolution and Lenin's death in 1924, four were executed, one (Tomsky) committed suicide and two (Molotov and Kalinin) lived.\n\nHowever, the trials and executions of the former Bolshevik leaders, while being the most visible part, were only a minor part of the purges. A series of documents discovered in the Central Committee archives in 1992 by Vladimir Bukovsky demonstrate that there were quotas for arrests and executions as for all other activities in the planned economy.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, 2,000 writers, intellectuals, and artists were imprisoned and 1,500 died in prisons and concentration camps. After sunspot development research was judged un-Marxist, twenty-seven astronomers disappeared between 1936 and 1938. The Meteorological Office was violently purged as early as 1933 for failing to predict weather harmful to the crops. But the toll was especially high among writers. Those who perished during the Great Purge include:\n\nThe investigators began to use force on me, a sick 65-year-old man. I was made to lie face down and beaten on the soles of my feet and my spine with a rubber strap ... For the next few days, when those parts of my legs were covered with extensive internal hemorrhaging, they again beat the red-blue-and-yellow bruises with the strap and the pain was so intense that it felt as if boiling water was being poured on these sensitive areas. I howled and wept from the pain. I incriminated myself in the hope that by telling them lies I could end the ordeal. When I lay down on the cot and fell asleep, after 18 hours of interrogation, in order to go back in an hour's time for more, I was woken up by my own groaning and because I was jerking about like a patient in the last stages of typhoid fever. \n\n\nOn 2 July 1937, Stalin sent a top-secret letter to all regional Party chiefs (with a copy to NKVD regional chiefs) ordering them to present, within five days, estimates of the number of kulaks and \"criminals\" that should be arrested, executed, or sent to camps. Produced in a matter of days, these figures roughly matched those of \"suspect\" individuals already under police surveillance, although the criteria used to distribute the \"kulak and criminal elements\" among the two categories are not clear.\n\nOn 30 July 1937 the NKVD Order no. 00447 was issued, directed against \"ex-kulaks\" and other \"anti-Soviet elements\" (such as former officials of the Tsarist regime, former members of political parties other than the communist party, etc.). They were to be executed or sent to Gulag prison camps extrajudicially, under the decisions of NKVD troikas.\n\nThe following categories were systematically tracked down: \"ex-kulaks\" previously deported to \"special settlements\" in inhospitable parts of the country (Siberia, Urals, Kazakhstan, Far North), former tsarist civil servants, former officers of the White Army, participants in peasant rebellions, members of the clergy, persons deprived of voting rights, former members of non-Bolshevik parties, ordinary criminals, like thieves, known to the police and various other \"socially harmful elements\". However, many were also arrested at random in police sweeps, or as a result of denunciations or simply because they happened to be relatives, friends or just acquaintances of people already arrested. Many railwaymen, workers, kolkhoz peasants, and engineers were arrested in the course of the Kulak Operation just because they had the misfortune of working in, or near, important strategic factories, railway or building sites, where, as a result of frantic rhythms and plans, many work accidents had occurred in previous years. In 1937–1938, the NKVD reopened these cases and systematically ascribed them to \"sabotage\" or \"wrecking\" (Werth, 2009).\n\nThe orthodox clergy, including active parishioners, was nearly annihilated: 85% of the 35,000 members of the clergy were arrested. Particularly vulnerable to repression were also the so-called \"special settlers\" (spetzpereselentsy) who were under permanent police surveillance and constituted a huge pool of potential \"enemies\" to draw on. At least 100,000 of them were arrested in the course of the Great Terror.\n\nOne \"sub-operation\" targeted \"the most vicious and stubborn anti-Soviet elements\" in Gulag prison camps; they were all \"to be put into the first category\" – that is shot. Order no. 00447 decreed 10,000 executions for this contingent, but at least three times more were shot in the course of the secret mass operation, the majority in March–April 1938 (Junge and Binner, 2003).\n\nAs soon as the Kulak Operation was launched (5 August 1937), regional party and NKVD bosses, eager to show their zeal, demanded an increase in the quotas. Accordingly, the quotas were increased. But this was not only the result of demands from below. The largest new allowances were distributed by Stalin and Yezhov on their own initiative: on 15 October 1937, for example, the Politburo passed a secret resolution increasing the number of people \"to be repressed\" by 120,000 (63,000 \"in the first category\" and 57,000 \"in the second category\"); on 31 January 1938, Stalin ordered a further increase of 57,200, 48,000 of whom were to be executed.\nThe police organized sweeps and round-ups of markets or railway stations where marginals and other social outcasts were likely to be found. To carry out a growing number of arrests, the State Security personnel of NKVD – approximately 25,000 officers – were supplemented by ordinary policemen, sometimes by civilian Party or Komsomol (Young Communist League) members.\n\nEvery NKVD local unit had a \"casework minimum\" of arrests to perform, and also of confessions to extract to \"unmask conspiracies.\" The NKVD used uninterrupted interrogation for days on end and merciless beatings to force prisoners to confess their alleged \"counter-revolutionary\" crimes. To speed up the procedure, prisoners were often even forced to sign blank pages of the pre-printed interrogation folios on which the interrogator later typed up the confession.\n\nAfter the interrogations the files were submitted to NKVD troikas, which pronounced the verdicts in the absence of the accused. During a half-day-long session a troika went through several hundred cases, delivering either a death sentence or a sentence to the Gulag labor camps. Death sentences were immediately enforceable. The executions were carried out at night, either in prisons or in a secluded area run by the NKVD and located as a rule on the outskirts of major cities.\n\nThe Kulak Operation was largest single campaign of repression in 1937–38, with 669,929 people arrested and 376,202 executed, more than half the total of known executions.\n\nA series of mass operations of the NKVD was carried out from 1937 through 1938 until the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 targeting specific nationalities within the Soviet Union, based on NKVD directives against the so-called diversionist element, according to the notion of the \"hostile capitalist surrounding\" as defined by Nikolai Yezhov. The Polish operation of the NKVD was the largest of this kind. Over 111,000 of arrested Poles were executed. Their wives and children were dealt with by the NKVD Order № 00486. The women were sentenced to forced labour for 5 or 10 years. Their minor children were put in orphanages. All possessions were confiscated. Extended families were purposely left with nothing to live on, which usually sealed their fate as well, affecting up to 200,000–250,000 people of Polish background depending on size of their families.\nThe NKVD national operations were conducted on a quota system using album procedure. The officials were mandated to arrest and execute a specific number of so-called \"counter-revolutionaries,\" compiled by administration using various statistics but also telephone books with names sounding non-Russian. The Polish operation claimed the largest number of the NKVD victims: 143,810 arrests and 111,091 executions according to records. Snyder estimates that at least eighty-five thousand of them were ethnic Poles. The remainder were 'suspected' of being Polish, without further inquiry.\n\nVictims of the terror included American immigrants to the Soviet Union who had emigrated at the height of the Great Depression to find work. At the height of the Terror, American immigrants besieged the US embassy, begging for passports so they could leave the Soviet Union. They were turned away by embassy officials, only to be arrested on the pavement outside by lurking NKVD agents. Many were subsequently shot dead at Butovo Field near Scherbinka, south of Moscow. In addition, 141 American Communists of Finnish origin were executed and buried at Sandarmokh.\n127 Finnish Canadians were also shot and buried there.\n\nDuring the late 1930s, Stalin dispatched NKVD operatives to the Mongolian People's Republic, established a Mongolian version of the NKVD troika, and proceeded to execute tens of thousands of people accused of having ties to \"pro-Japanese spy rings.\" Buddhist lamas made up the majority of victims, with 18,000 being killed in the terror. Other victims were nobility and political and academic figures, along with some ordinary workers and herders. Mass graves containing hundreds of executed Buddhist monks and civilians have been discovered as recently as 2003.\n\nThe pro-Soviet leader Sheng Shicai of Xinjiang province in China launched his own purge in 1937 to coincide with Stalin's Great Purge. The Xinjiang War (1937) broke out amid the purge. Sheng received assistance from the NKVD. Sheng and the Soviets alleged a massive Trotskyist conspiracy and a \"Fascist Trotskyite plot\" to destroy the Soviet Union. The Soviet Consul General Garegin Apresoff, General Ma Hushan, Ma Shaowu, Mahmud Sijan, the official leader of the Xinjiang province Huang Han-chang and Hoja-Niyaz were among the 435 alleged conspirators in the plot. Xinjiang came under virtual Soviet control. Stalin opposed the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe Great Purge of 1936–1938 can be roughly divided into four periods:\n\nIn the summer of 1938 Yezhov was relieved from his post as head of the NKVD and was eventually tried and executed. Lavrentiy Beria, a fellow Georgian and Stalin confidant, succeeded him as head of NKVD. On 17 November 1938 a joint decree of Sovnarkom USSR and Central Committee of VKP(b) (Decree about Arrests, Prosecutor Supervision and Course of Investigation) and the subsequent order of NKVD undersigned by Beria, cancelled most of the NKVD orders of systematic repression and suspended implementation of death sentences. The decree signaled the end of massive Soviet purges.\n\nNevertheless, the practice of mass arrest and exile continued until Stalin's death in 1953. Political executions also continued, but, with the exception of Katyn and other NKVD massacres during World War II, on a vastly smaller scale. One notorious example is the \"Night of the Murdered Poets\", in which at least thirteen prominent Yiddish writers were executed on 12 August 1952. Historians such as Michael Parrish have argued that while the Great Terror ended in 1938, a lesser terror continued in the 1940s. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (a Soviet Army officer who became a prisoner for a decade in the Gulag system) presents in \"The Gulag Archipelago\" the most holistic view of the timeline of \"all\" the Leninist and Stalinist purges (1918–1956), in which the 1936–38 purge may have been simply the one that got the most attention from people in a position to record its magnitude for posterity—the intelligentsia—by directly targeting them, whereas several other waves of the ongoing flow of purges, such as the 1928–33 collectivization and dekulakization, were just as huge and just as devoid of justice but were more successfully swallowed into oblivion in the popular memory of the (surviving) Soviet public. For example, in one such passage Solzhenitsyn mentions 1938 and says that 1948 was in some ways hardly better.\n\nIn some cases, high military command arrested under Yezhov were later executed under Beria. Some examples include Marshal of the Soviet Union Alexander Yegorov, arrested in April 1938 and shot (or died from torture) in February 1939 (his wife, G. A. Yegorova, was shot in August 1938); Army Commander Ivan Fedko, arrested July 1938 and shot February 1939; Flagman , arrested May 1938 and shot February 1940; Komkor G. I. Bondar, arrested August 1938 and shot March 1939. All the aforementioned have been posthumously rehabilitated.\n\nWhen the relatives of those who had been executed in 1937–38 inquired about their fate, they were told by NKVD that their arrested relatives had been sentenced to \"ten years without the right of correspondence\" (десять лет без права переписки). When these ten-year periods elapsed in 1947–48 but the arrested did not appear, the relatives asked MGB about their fate again and this time were told that the arrested died in imprisonment.\n\nAlthough the trials of former Soviet leaders were widely publicized, the hundreds of thousands of other arrests and executions were not. These became known in the West only as a few former gulag inmates reached the West with their stories. Not only did foreign correspondents from the West fail to report on the purges, but in many Western nations (especially France), attempts were made to silence or discredit these witnesses; according to Robert Conquest, Jean-Paul Sartre took the position that evidence of the camps should be ignored so the French proletariat would not be discouraged. A series of legal actions ensued at which definitive evidence was presented that established the validity of the former labor camp inmates' testimony.\n\nAccording to Robert Conquest in his 1968 book \"The Great Terror: Stalin's Purge of the Thirties\", with respect to the trials of former leaders, some Western observers were unable to see through the fraudulent nature of the charges and evidence, notably Walter Duranty of \"The New York Times\", a Russian speaker; the American Ambassador, Joseph E. Davies, who reported, \"proof...beyond reasonable doubt to justify the verdict of treason\" and Beatrice and Sidney Webb, authors of \"Soviet Communism: A New Civilization\". While \"Communist Parties everywhere simply transmitted the Soviet line\", some of the most critical reporting also came from the left, notably \"The Manchester Guardian\". The American journalist H. R. Knickerbocker also reported on the executions. He called them in 1941 \"the great purges\", and described how over four years they affected \"the top fourth or fifth, to estimate it conservatively, of the Party itself, of the Army, Navy, and Air Force leaders and then of the new Bolshevik intelligentsia, the foremost technicians, managers, supervisors, scientists\". Knickerbocker also wrote about dekulakization: \"It is a conservative estimate to say that some 5,000,000 [kulaks] ... died at once, or within a few years.\"\n\nEvidence and the results of research began to appear after Stalin's death. This revealed the full enormity of the Purges. The first of these sources were the revelations of Nikita Khrushchev, which particularly affected the American editors of the Communist Party USA newspaper, the \"Daily Worker\", who, following the lead of \"The New York Times\", published the Secret Speech in full.\n\nThe Great Purge was denounced by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev following Stalin's death. In his secret speech to the 20th CPSU congress in February 1956 (which was made public a month later), Khrushchev referred to the purges as an \"abuse of power\" by Stalin which resulted in enormous harm to the country. In the same speech, he recognized that many of the victims were innocent and were convicted on the basis of false confessions extracted by torture. To take that position was politically useful to Khrushchev, as he was at that time engaged in a power struggle with rivals who had been associated with the Purge, the so-called Anti-Party Group. The new line on the Great Purges undermined their power, and helped propel him to the Chairmanship of the Council of Ministers. Starting from 1954, some of the convictions were overturned. Mikhail Tukhachevsky and other generals convicted in the Trial of Red Army Generals were declared innocent (\"rehabilitated\") in 1957. The former Politburo members Yan Rudzutak and Stanislav Kosior and many lower-level victims were also declared innocent in the 1950s. Nikolai Bukharin and others convicted in the Moscow Trials were not rehabilitated until as late as 1988. Leon Trotsky, considered a major player in the Russian Revolution and a major contributor to Marxist Theory was never rehabilitated by the USSR. The book \"Rehabilitation: The Political Processes of the 1930s–50s\" (Реабилитация. Политические процессы 30-50-х годов) (1991) contains a large amount of newly presented original archive material: transcripts of interrogations, letters of convicts, and photos. The material demonstrates in detail how numerous show trials were fabricated.\n\nOfficial figures put the total number of documentable executions during the years 1937 and 1938 at 681,692, whereas the total estimate of deaths brought about by Soviet repression during the Great Purge ranges from 950,000 to 1.2 million, which includes executions, deaths in detention and those who died shortly after being released from the Gulag, as a result of their treatment therein. This estimate summarises results of comparative analysis of various archival documents and, therefore, takes into account earlier arguments that official Soviet archival data may understate the actual number of deaths, be incomplete or unreliable. A common practice of falsification for lowering the execution numbers was disguising executions with the sentence ten years without the right of correspondence. All of the bodies identified from the mass graves at Vinnitsa and Kuropaty were of individuals who had received this sentence. \nThe lower figure did roughly confirm Conquest's original 1968 estimate of 700,000 \"legal\" executions and in the preface to the 40th anniversary edition of \"The Great Terror\", Conquest claimed that he had been \"correct on the vital matter—the numbers put to death: about one million.\"\n\nHistorians with archival access have confirmed that Stalin was intimately involved in the terror. Russian historian Oleg V. Khlevniuk states \"…theories about the elemental, spontaneous nature of the terror, about a loss of central control over the course of mass repression, and about the role of regional leaders in initiating the terror are simply not supported by the historical record.\" Stalin personally directed Yezhov to torture those who were not making proper confessions. In one instance, he told Yezhov \"Isn't it time to squeeze this gentleman and force him to report on his dirty little business? Where is he: in a prison or a hotel?\" In another, while reviewing one of Yezhov's lists, he added to M. I. Baranov's name, \"beat, beat!\" According to Stalin biographer Simon Sebag Montefiore, he never attended torture sessions or executions.\n\nIn addition to authorizing enhanced interrogation techniques, Stalin also signed 357 lists in 1937 and 1938 authorizing executions of some 40,000 people, and about 90% of these are confirmed to have been shot. While reviewing one such list, Stalin reportedly muttered to no one in particular: \"Who's going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years time? No one. Who remembers the names now of the boyars Ivan the Terrible got rid of? No one.\" Stalin's alleged remark may be compared with Hitler's famous admonition to his generals in 1939: \"Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?\"\n\nStephen G. Wheatcroft posits that while the 'purposive deaths' caused by Hitler constitute 'murder', those caused by Stalin fall into the category of 'execution'. He elaborates:\n\nStalin undoubtedly caused many innocent people to be executed, but it seems likely that he thought many of them guilty of crimes against the state and felt that the execution of others would act as a deterent to the guilty. He signed the papers and insisted on documentation. Hitler, by contrast, wanted to be rid of the Jews and communists simply because they were Jews and communists. He was not concerned about making any pretence at legality. He was careful not to sign anything on this matter and was equally insistent on no documentation.\n\nAt least two Soviet commissions investigated the show-trials after Stalin's death. The first was headed by Molotov and included Voroshilov, Kaganovich, Suslov, Furtseva, Shvernik, Aristov, Pospelov, and Rudenko. They were given the task to investigate the materials concerning Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and others. The commission worked in 1956–1957. While stating that the accusations against Tukhachevsky \"et al.\" should be abandoned, it failed to fully rehabilitate the victims of the three Moscow trials, although the final report does contain an admission that the accusations have not been proven during the trials and \"evidence\" had been produced by lies, blackmail, and \"use of physical influence\". Bukharin, Rykov, Zinoviev, and others were still seen as political opponents, and though the charges against them were obviously false, they could not have been rehabilitated because \"for many years they headed the anti-Soviet struggle against the building of socialism in USSR\".\n\nThe second commission largely worked from 1961 to 1963 and was headed by Shvernik (\"Shvernik Commission\"). It included Shelepin, Serdyuk, Mironov, Rudenko, and Semichastny. The hard work resulted in two massive reports, which detailed the mechanism of falsification of the show-trials against Bukharin, Zinoviev, Tukhachevsky, and many others. The commission based its findings in large part on eyewitness testimonies of former NKVD workers and victims of repressions, and on many documents. The commission recommended rehabilitating every accused with the exceptions of Radek and Yagoda, because Radek's materials required some further checking, and Yagoda was a criminal and one of the falsifiers of the trials (though most of the charges against him had to be dropped too, he was not a \"spy\", etc.). The commission stated:\n\nStalin committed a very grave crime against the Communist party, the socialist state, Soviet people and worldwide revolutionary movement... Together with Stalin, the responsibility for the abuse of law, mass unwarranted repressions and death of many thousands of wholly innocent people also lies on Molotov, Kaganovich, Malenkov...\n\nIn the late 1980s, with the formation of the Memorial Society and similar organisations across the Soviet Union it became possible not only to speak about the Great Terror, but also to begin locating the killing grounds of 1937-1938 and identifying those who lay buried there.\n\nIn 1988, for instance, the mass graves at Kurapaty in Belarus were the site of a clash between demonstrators and the police. In 1990, a boulder stone was brought from the former Solovki prison camp in the White Sea, and erected next to KGB headquarters in Moscow as a memorial to all \"the victims of political repression\" since 1917.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, many more mass graves filled with executed victims of the terror were discovered and turned into memorial sites. Some, such as the killing fields Bykivnia near Kiev, are said to contain up to 200,000 corpses.\n\nIn 2007, one such site, the Butovo firing range near Moscow, was turned into a shrine to the victims of Stalinism. Between August 1937 and October 1938, more than 20,000 people were shot and buried there.\n\nOn 30 October 2017, President Vladimir Putin opened the Wall of Sorrow, an official but controversial recognition of the crimes of the Soviet regime.\n\nThe Great Purge has provoked numerous debates about its purpose, scale and mechanisms. According to one interpretation, Stalin's regime had to maintain its citizens in a state of fear and uncertainty to stay in power (Brzezinski, 1958). Robert Conquest emphasized Stalin's paranoia, focused on the Moscow show trial of \"Old Bolsheviks\", and analyzed the carefully planned and systematic destruction of the Communist Party. Some others view the Great Purge as a crucial moment – or rather the culmination – of a vast social engineering campaign started at the beginning of the 1930s (Hagenloh, 2000; Shearer, 2003; Werth, 2003).\n\nAccording to historian James Harris, contemporary archival research pokes \"rather large holes in the traditional story\" weaved by Conquest and others. His findings, while not exonerating Stalin or the Soviet state, dispel the notion that the bloodletting was merely the result of Stalin attempting to establish his own personal dictatorship; evidence suggests he was committed to building the socialist state envisioned by Lenin. The real motivation for the terror, according to Harris, was an over-exaggerated fear of counterrevolution:\n\nSo what was the motivation behind the Terror? The answers required a lot more digging, but it gradually became clearer that the violence of the late 1930s was driven by fear. Most Bolsheviks, Stalin among them, believed that the revolutions of 1789, 1848 and 1871 had failed because their leaders hadn't adequately anticipated the ferocity of the counter-revolutionary reaction from the establishment. They were determined not to make the same mistake.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is sometimes implied that they may be aliens themselves. The term is also frequently used to describe mysterious men working for unknown organizations, as well as various branches of government allegedly designed to protect secrets or perform other strange activities. The term is generic, used for any unusual, threatening or strangely behaved individual whose appearance on the scene can be linked in some fashion with a UFO sighting. Several alleged encounters with the men in black have been reported by UFO researchers and enthusiasts.\n\nStories about allegedly real-life men in black inspired the semi-comic science fiction \"Men in Black\" franchise of comic books, films, and other media.\n\nFolklorist James R. Lewis compares accounts of men in black with tales of people encountering Lucifer and speculates that they can be considered a kind of \"psychological drama\".\n\nMen in black figure prominently in ufology and UFO folklore. In the 1950s and 1960s, UFOlogists adopted a conspiratorial mindset and began to fear they would be subject to organized intimidation in retaliation for discovering \"the truth of the UFOs\".\n\nIn 1947, Harold Dahl claimed to have been warned not to talk about his alleged UFO sighting on Maury Island by a man in a dark suit. In the mid-1950s, the ufologist Albert K. Bender claimed he was visited by men in dark suits who threatened and warned him not to continue investigating UFOs. Bender maintained that the men in black were secret government agents who had been given the task of suppressing evidence of UFOs. The ufologist John Keel claimed to have had encounters with men in black and referred to them as \"demonic supernaturals\" with \"dark skin and/or ‘exotic’ facial features\". According to the ufologist Jerome Clark, reports of men in black represent \"experiences\" that \"don't seem to have occurred in the world of consensus reality\".\n\nHistorian Aaron Gulyas wrote, \"during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, UFO conspiracy theorists would incorporate the Men in Black into their increasingly complex and paranoid visions\".\n\nIn his article, \"Gray Barker: My Friend, the Myth-Maker,\" John C. Sherwood claims that, in the late 1960s, at the age of 18, he cooperated when Gray Barker urged him to develop a hoax—which Barker subsequently published—about what Barker called \"blackmen\", three mysterious UFO inhabitants who silenced Sherwood's pseudonymous identity, \"Dr. Richard H.

It accepts for competition only films by African filmmakers and chiefly produced in Africa. FESPACO is scheduled in March of each year, two weeks after the last Saturday of February. Its opening night is held in the Stade du 4-Août, the national stadium.\n\nThe festival offers African film professionals the chance to establish working relationships, exchange ideas, and to promote their work. FESPACO's stated aim is to \"contribute to the expansion and development of African cinema as means of expression, education and awareness-raising\". It has also worked to establish a market for African films and industry professionals. Since FESPACO's founding, the festival has attracted attendees from across the continent and beyond.\n\nCreated in 1969, it was first called the Pan-African film and television festival of Ouagadougou. It has evolved into an internationally recognized and respected event. Alimata Salambere, the cultural minister of Burkina Faso from 1987 to 1991, was one of the founders of the festival. At its third edition in 1972, the festival was named FESPACO for short, keeping its full title as \"Festival pan-Africain du cinema et de la television de Ouagadougou.\" FESPACO was recognized formally as an institution by governmental decree on January 7, 1972. Its award ceremony and base of operations is Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, where the annual awards ceremony is also held.\n\nIn 1972 the first winner of the best film award was \"Le Wazzou Polygame\" by Oumarou Ganda of Niger. Since then, the best film award has been won by directors from Cameroon, Morocco, Mali, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Burkina Faso, Ghana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nAt the festival's founding in 1969, five African nations: Upper Volta (Burkina Faso), Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Niger and Senegal, were represented, as well as France and the Netherlands. A total of 23 films were shown. At its second edition, the participant African countries rose to nine, including for the first time Algeria, Tunisia, Guinea, Mali, and Ghana, and a total of 40 films were shown. In 1983, the festival included MICA (\"le Marche International du Cinema et de la television Africaine\"), a market for African film stock and video footage.\n\nFrom 1985 onward, the festival adopted different themes for the annual event, starting with \"the cinema, people, and liberation\". The theme for the 2007 festival was \"the actor in the creation and promotion of African films\".\n\nAs the festival became more prominent, its budget and sponsors increased; the donor countries include Burkina Faso, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Republic of China. Donor organizations include AIF (ACCT), PNUD, UNESCO, UNICEF, European Union and Africalia. Due to its international recognition, FESPACO has enabled African filmmakers to show their talents and sell their products in the international market, as well as to promote development of African products and technicians in the industry.\n\nThe general secretaries of FESPACO since 1972 have been Louis Tombiano, from 1972 to 1982; Alimata Salembere, from 1982 to 1984; Filippe Savadogo, from 1984 to 1996, Baba Hama, from 1996 to 2008, Michel Ouedraogo, from 2008 to 2014, and Ardiouma Soma, from 2014 to present.\n\n\nThe most prestigious award of the festival is the \"Étalon de Yennenga\" (Stallion of Yennenga), named after the legendary founder of the Mossi empire. The \"Étalon de Yennenga\" is awarded to the African film that best shows \"Africa's realities\".\n\nOther special awards include the Oumarou Ganda Prize, given for the best first film, and the Paul Robeson Prize for the best film by a director of the African diaspora. (The latter is named for a major 20th-century American actor, singer and civil rights activist in the United States.)\n\n\n"}
{"id": "428364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428364", "title": "Phishing", "text": "Phishing\n\nPhishing is the fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by disguising as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Typically carried out by email spoofing or instant messaging, it often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website, the look and feel of which are identical to the legitimate site. \n\nPhishing is an example of social engineering techniques being used to deceive users. Users are often lured by communications purporting to be from trusted parties such as social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT administrators.\n\nThe annual worldwide impact of phishing could be as high as US$5 billion. Attempts to deal with phishing incidents include legislation, user training, public awareness, and technical security measures - because phishing attacks also often exploit weaknesses in current web security.\n\nThe word itself is a neologism created as a homophone of \"fishing\", due to the similarity of using a bait in an attempt to catch a victim.\n\nPhishing attempts directed at specific individuals or companies have been termed spear phishing. In contrast to bulk phishing, spear phishing attackers often gather and use personal information about their target to increase their probability of success.\n\nThreat Group-4127 (Fancy Bear) used spear phishing tactics to target email accounts linked to Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. They attacked more than 1,800 Google accounts and implemented the accounts-google.com domain to threaten targeted users.\n\nClone phishing is a type of phishing attack whereby a legitimate, and previously delivered, email containing an attachment or link has had its content and recipient address(es) taken and used to create an almost identical or cloned email. The attachment or link within the email is replaced with a malicious version and then sent from an email address spoofed to appear to come from the original sender. It may claim to be a resend of the original or an updated version to the original. This technique could be used to pivot (indirectly) from a previously infected machine and gain a foothold on another machine, by exploiting the social trust associated with the inferred connection due to both parties receiving the original email.\n\nThe term whaling has been coined for spear phishing attacks directed specifically at senior executives and other high-profile targets. In these cases, the content will be crafted to target an upper manager and the person's role in the company. The content of a whaling attack email may be an executive issue such as a subpoena or customer complaint.\n\nMost methods of phishing use some form of technical deception designed to make a link in an email (and the spoofed website it leads to) appear to belong to the spoofed organization. Misspelled URLs or the use of subdomains are common tricks used by phishers. In the following example URL, <nowiki>http://www.yourbank.example.com/</nowiki>, it appears as though the URL will take you to the \"example\" section of the \"yourbank\" website; actually this URL points to the \"yourbank\" (i.e. phishing) section of the \"example\" website. Another common trick is to make the displayed text for a link (the text between the tags) suggest a reliable destination, when the link actually goes to the phishers' site. Many desktop email clients and web browsers will show a link's target URL in the status bar while hovering the mouse over it. This behavior, however, may in some circumstances be overridden by the phisher. Equivalent mobile apps generally do not have this preview feature.\n\nInternationalized domain names (IDN) can be exploited via IDN spoofing or homograph attacks, to create web addresses visually identical to a legitimate site, that lead instead to malicious version. Phishers have taken advantage of a similar risk, using open URL redirectors on the websites of trusted organizations to disguise malicious URLs with a trusted domain.\nEven digital certificates do not solve this problem because it is quite possible for a phisher to purchase a valid certificate and subsequently change content to spoof a genuine website, or, to host the phish site without SSL at all.\n\nPhishers have sometimes used images instead of text to make it harder for anti-phishing filters to detect the text commonly used in phishing emails. In response, more sophisticated anti-phishing filters are able to recover hidden text in images using OCR (optical character recognition).\n\nSome phishing scams use JavaScript commands in order to alter the address bar of the website they lead to. This is done either by placing a picture of a legitimate URL over the address bar, or by closing the original bar and opening up a new one with the legitimate URL.\n\nAn attacker can also potentially use flaws in a trusted website's own scripts against the victim. These types of attacks (known as cross-site scripting) are particularly problematic, because they direct the user to sign in at their bank or service's own web page, where everything from the web address to the security certificates appears correct. In reality, the link to the website is crafted to carry out the attack, making it very difficult to spot without specialist knowledge. Such a flaw was used in 2006 against PayPal.\n\nTo avoid anti-phishing techniques that scan websites for phishing-related text, phishers sometimes use Flash-based websites (a technique known as phlashing). These look much like the real website, but hide the text in a multimedia object.\n\nCovert redirect is a subtle method to perform phishing attacks that makes links appear legitimate, but actually redirect a victim to an attacker's website. The flaw is usually masqueraded under a log-in popup based on an affected site's domain. It can affect OAuth 2.0 and OpenID based on well-known exploit parameters as well. This often makes use of open redirect and XSS vulnerabilities in the third-party application websites. Browshing is another way of redirecting users to phishing websites covertly through malicious browser extensions.\n\nNormal phishing attempts can be easy to spot because the malicious page's URL will usually be different from the real site link. For covert redirect, an attacker could use a real website instead by corrupting the site with a malicious login popup dialogue box. This makes covert redirect different from others.\n\nFor example, suppose a victim clicks a malicious phishing link beginning with Facebook. A popup window from Facebook will ask whether the victim would like to authorize the app. If the victim chooses to authorize the app, a \"token\" will be sent to the attacker and the victim's personal sensitive information could be exposed. These information may include the email address, birth date, contacts, and work history. In case the \"token” has greater privilege, the attacker could obtain more sensitive information including the mailbox, online presence, and friends list. Worse still, the attacker may possibly control and operate the user’s account. Even if the victim does not choose to authorize the app, he or she will still get redirected to a website controlled by the attacker. This could potentially further compromise the victim.\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by Wang Jing, a Mathematics Ph.D. student at School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences in Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Covert redirect is a notable security flaw, though it is not a threat to the Internet worth significant attention.\n\nUsers can be encouraged to click on various kinds of unexpected content for a variety of technical and social reasons. For example, a malicious attachment might masquerade as a benign linked Google doc.\n\nAlternatively users might be outraged by a fake news story, click a link and become infected.\n\nNot all phishing attacks require a fake website. Messages that claimed to be from a bank told users to dial a phone number regarding problems with their bank accounts. Once the phone number (owned by the phisher, and provided by a voice over IP service) was dialled, prompts told users to enter their account numbers and PIN. Vishing (voice phishing) sometimes uses fake caller-ID data to give the appearance that calls come from a trusted organization.\n\n\nA phishing technique was described in detail in a paper and presentation delivered to the 1987 International HP Users Group, Interex.\n\nThe term 'phishing' is said to have been coined by the well known spammer and hacker in the mid-90s, Khan C Smith. The first recorded mention of the term is found in the hacking tool AOHell (according to its creator), which included a function for attempting to steal the passwords or financial details of America Online users.\n\nPhishing on AOL was closely associated with the warez community that exchanged unlicensed software and the black hat hacking scene that perpetrated credit card fraud and other online crimes. AOL enforcement would detect words used in AOL chat rooms to suspend the accounts individuals involved in counterfeiting software and trading stolen accounts. The term was used because '<><' is the single most common tag of HTML that was found in all chat transcripts naturally, and as such could not be detected or filtered by AOL staff. The symbol <>< was replaced for any wording that referred to stolen credit cards, accounts, or illegal activity. Since the symbol looked like a fish, and due to the popularity of phreaking it was adapted as 'Phishing'. AOHell, released in early 1995, was a program designed to hack AOL users by allowing the attacker to pose as an AOL staff member, and send an instant message to a potential victim, asking him to reveal his password. In order to lure the victim into giving up sensitive information, the message might include imperatives such as \"verify your account\" or \"confirm billing information\".\n\nOnce the victim had revealed the password, the attacker could access and use the victim's account for fraudulent purposes. Both phishing and warezing on AOL generally required custom-written programs, such as AOHell. Phishing became so prevalent on AOL that they added a line on all instant messages stating: \"no one working at AOL will ask for your password or billing information\". A user using both an AIM account and an AOL account from an ISP simultaneously could phish AOL members with relative impunity as internet AIM accounts could be used by non-AOL internet members and could not be actioned (i.e., reported to AOL TOS department for disciplinary action).. In late 1995, AOL crackers resorted to phishing for legitimate accounts after AOL brought in measures in late 1995 to prevent using fake, algorithmically generated credit card numbers to open accounts. Eventually, AOL's policy enforcement forced copyright infringement off AOL servers, and AOL promptly deactivate accounts involved in phishing, often before the victims could respond. The shutting down of the warez scene on AOL caused most phishers to leave the service.\n\n\n\n\nThere are anti-phishing websites which publish exact messages that have been recently circulating the internet, such as FraudWatch International and Millersmiles. Such sites often provide specific details about the particular messages.\n\nAs recently as 2007, the adoption of anti-phishing strategies by businesses needing to protect personal and financial information was low. Now there are several different techniques to combat phishing, including legislation and technology created specifically to protect against phishing. These techniques include steps that can be taken by individuals, as well as by organizations. Phone, web site, and email phishing can now be reported to authorities, as described below.\n\nPeople can be trained to recognize phishing attempts, and to deal with them through a variety of approaches. Such education can be effective, especially where training emphasises conceptual knowledge and provides direct feedback. \n\nMany organisations run regular simulated phishing campaigns targeting their staff to measure the effectiveness of their training.\n\nPeople can take steps to avoid phishing attempts by slightly modifying their browsing habits. When contacted about an account needing to be \"verified\" (or any other topic used by phishers), it is a sensible precaution to contact the company from which the email apparently originates to check that the email is legitimate. Alternatively, the address that the individual knows is the company's genuine website can be typed into the address bar of the browser, rather than trusting any hyperlinks in the suspected phishing message.\n\nNearly all legitimate e-mail messages from companies to their customers contain an item of information that is not readily available to phishers. Some companies, for example PayPal, always address their customers by their username in emails, so if an email addresses the recipient in a generic fashion (\"Dear PayPal customer\") it is likely to be an attempt at phishing. Furthermore, PayPal offers various methods to determine spoof emails and advises users to forward suspicious emails to their spoof@PayPal.com domain to investigate and warn other customers. However it is it unsafe to assume that the presence of personal information alone guarantees that a message is legitimate, and some studies have shown that the presence of personal information does not significantly affect the success rate of phishing attacks; which suggests that most people do not pay attention to such details.\n\nEmails from banks and credit card companies often include partial account numbers. However, recent research has shown that the public do not typically distinguish between the first few digits and the last few digits of an account number—a significant problem since the first few digits are often the same for all clients of a financial institution.\n\nThe Anti-Phishing Working Group produces regular report on trends in phishing attacks.\n\nA wide range of technical approaches are available to prevent phishing attacks reaching users or to prevent them from successfully capturing sensitive information.\n\nAnother popular approach to fighting phishing is to maintain a list of known phishing sites and to check websites against the list. One such service is the Safe Browsing service. Web browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer 7, Mozilla Firefox 2.0, Safari 3.2, and Opera all contain this type of anti-phishing measure. Firefox 2 used Google anti-phishing software. Opera 9.1 uses live blacklists from Phishtank, cyscon and GeoTrust, as well as live whitelists from GeoTrust. Some implementations of this approach send the visited URLs to a central service to be checked, which has raised concerns about privacy. According to a report by Mozilla in late 2006, Firefox 2 was found to be more effective than Internet Explorer 7 at detecting fraudulent sites in a study by an independent software testing company.\n\nAn approach introduced in mid-2006 involves switching to a special DNS service that filters out known phishing domains: this will work with any browser, and is similar in principle to using a hosts file to block web adverts.\n\nTo mitigate the problem of phishing sites impersonating a victim site by embedding its images (such as logos), several site owners have altered the images to send a message to the visitor that a site may be fraudulent. The image may be moved to a new filename and the original permanently replaced, or a server can detect that the image was not requested as part of normal browsing, and instead send a warning image.\n\nThe Bank of America website is one of several that asks users to select a personal image (marketed as SiteKey) and displays this user-selected image with any forms that request a password. Users of the bank's online services are instructed to enter a password only when they see the image they selected. However, several studies suggest that few users refrain from entering their passwords when images are absent. In addition, this feature (like other forms of two-factor authentication) is susceptible to other attacks, such as those suffered by Scandinavian bank Nordea in late 2005, and Citibank in 2006.\n\nA similar system, in which an automatically generated \"Identity Cue\" consisting of a colored word within a colored box is displayed to each website user, is in use at other financial institutions.\n\nSecurity skins are a related technique that involves overlaying a user-selected image onto the login form as a visual cue that the form is legitimate. Unlike the website-based image schemes, however, the image itself is shared only between the user and the browser, and not between the user and the website. The scheme also relies on a mutual authentication protocol, which makes it less vulnerable to attacks that affect user-only authentication schemes.\n\nStill another technique relies on a dynamic grid of images that is different for each login attempt. The user must identify the pictures that fit their pre-chosen categories (such as dogs, cars and flowers). Only after they have correctly identified the pictures that fit their categories are they allowed to enter their alphanumeric password to complete the login. Unlike the static images used on the Bank of America website, a dynamic image-based authentication method creates a one-time passcode for the login, requires active participation from the user, and is very difficult for a phishing website to correctly replicate because it would need to display a different grid of randomly generated images that includes the user's secret categories.\n\nSpecialized spam filters can reduce the number of phishing emails that reach their addressees' inboxes, or provide post-delivery remediation, analyzing and removing spear phishing attacks upon delivery through email provider-level integration. These approaches rely on machine learning and natural language processing approaches to classify phishing emails. Email address authentication is another new approach.\n\nSeveral companies offer banks and other organizations likely to suffer from phishing scams round-the-clock services to monitor, analyze and assist in shutting down phishing websites. Individuals can contribute by reporting phishing to both volunteer and industry groups, such as cyscon or PhishTank. Individuals can also contribute by reporting phone phishing attempts to Phone Phishing, Federal Trade Commission. Phishing web pages and emails can be reported to Google. The Internet Crime Complaint Center noticeboard carries phishing and ransomware alerts.\n\nSolutions have also emerged using the mobile phone (smartphone) as a second channel for verification and authorization of banking transactions.\n\nAn article in \"Forbes\" in August 2014 argues that the reason phishing problems persist even after a decade of anti-phishing technologies being sold is that phishing is \"a technological medium to exploit human weaknesses\" and that technology cannot fully compensate for human weaknesses.\n\nOn January 26, 2004, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed the first lawsuit against a suspected phisher. The defendant, a Californian teenager, allegedly created a webpage designed to look like the America Online website, and used it to steal credit card information. Other countries have followed this lead by tracing and arresting phishers. A phishing kingpin, Valdir Paulo de Almeida, was arrested in Brazil for leading one of the largest phishing crime rings, which in two years stole between and . UK authorities jailed two men in June 2005 for their role in a phishing scam, in a case connected to the U.S. Secret Service Operation Firewall, which targeted notorious \"carder\" websites. In 2006 eight people were arrested by Japanese police on suspicion of phishing fraud by creating bogus Yahoo Japan Web sites, netting themselves (). The arrests continued in 2006 with the FBI Operation Cardkeeper detaining a gang of sixteen in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nIn the United States, Senator Patrick Leahy introduced the \"Anti-Phishing Act of 2005\" in Congress on March 1, 2005. This bill, if it had been enacted into law, would have subjected criminals who created fake web sites and sent bogus emails in order to defraud consumers to fines of up to and prison terms of up to five years.\nThe UK strengthened its legal arsenal against phishing with the Fraud Act 2006, which introduces a general offence of fraud that can carry up to a ten-year prison sentence, and prohibits the development or possession of phishing kits with intent to commit fraud.\n\nCompanies have also joined the effort to crack down on phishing. On March 31, 2005, Microsoft filed 117 federal lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. The lawsuits accuse \"John Doe\" defendants of obtaining passwords and confidential information. March 2005 also saw a partnership between Microsoft and the Australian government teaching law enforcement officials how to combat various cyber crimes, including phishing. Microsoft announced a planned further 100 lawsuits outside the U.S. in March 2006, followed by the commencement, as of November 2006, of 129 lawsuits mixing criminal and civil actions. AOL reinforced its efforts against phishing in early 2006 with three lawsuits seeking a total of under the 2005 amendments to the Virginia Computer Crimes Act, and Earthlink has joined in by helping to identify six men subsequently charged with phishing fraud in Connecticut.\n\nIn January 2007, Jeffrey Brett Goodin of California became the first defendant convicted by a jury under the provisions of the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003. He was found guilty of sending thousands of emails to America Online users, while posing as AOL's billing department, which prompted customers to submit personal and credit card information. Facing a possible 101 years in prison for the CAN-SPAM violation and ten other counts including wire fraud, the unauthorized use of credit cards, and the misuse of AOL's trademark, he was sentenced to serve 70 months. Goodin had been in custody since failing to appear for an earlier court hearing and began serving his prison term immediately.\n\n"}
{"id": "2040311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2040311", "title": "Plumpy'nut", "text": "Plumpy'nut\n\nPlumpy'Nut is a peanut-based paste in a plastic wrapper for treatment of severe acute malnutrition manufactured by Nutriset, a French company. Removing the need for hospitalization, the 92-gram (3¼ oz) packets of this paste can be administered at home and allow larger numbers to be treated.\n\nPlumpy'Nut may be referred to in scientific literature as a Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) alongside other RUTFs such as BP100.\n\nNutriset has been criticized by Médecins Sans Frontières for enforcing its Plumpy'nut patents.\n\nPlumpy’Nut is used as a treatment for emergency malnutrition cases. It supports rapid weight gain derived from broad nutrient intake which can alleviate a starving child from impending illness or death. The product is easy for children to eat because it dispenses readily from a durable, tear-open package. The fortified peanut butter-like paste contains fats, dietary fiber, carbohydrates, proteins (as essential macronutrients), vitamins and minerals (as essential micronutrients). Peanut butter itself is a rich source of vitamin E (45% of the Daily Value, DV, in a 100 gram amount) and B vitamins (particularly niacin at 67% DV).\n\nPlumpy'Nut has a two-year shelf-life and requires no water, preparation, or refrigeration. Its ease of use has made mass treatment of malnutrition in famine situations more efficient than in the past. Severe acute malnutrition has traditionally been treated with therapeutic milk and required hospitalization. Unlike milk, Plumpy'Nut can be administered at home and without medical supervision. It also provides calories and essential nutrients that restore and maintain body weight and health in severely malnourished children more effectively than F100.\n\nThe United Nations has recognized this utility, stating in 2007 that \"new evidence suggests... that large numbers of children with severe acute malnutrition can be treated in their communities without being admitted to a health facility or a therapeutic feeding centre,\" as was implemented in 2007 by UNICEF and the European Commission’s Humanitarian Aid Department in Niger to address a malnutrition emergency. Plumpy'nut conforms to the UN definition of a Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF).\n\nPlumpy'nut is not intended for routine nutrition, or for malnutrition in non-famine situations. Peanut allergies have not been found to be a problem in usage due to a lack of allergic reactions in the target populations.\n\nThe ingredients in Plumpy'Nut include \"peanut-based paste, with sugar, vegetable oil and skimmed milk powder, enriched with vitamins and minerals\". Plumpy'Nut is said to be \"surprisingly tasty\".\n\nWhile the majority of Plumpy'Nut was made in France as of 2010, this therapeutic food is easily produced and can be made locally in peanut-growing areas by mixing peanut paste with a slurry of other ingredients provisioned by Nutriset.\n\nA number of partner companies and one non-profit organization in the U.S state of Rhode Island make Plumpy'Nut; six of the factories are in African countries (Niger, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Sudan, Madagascar, Kenya), one is in Haiti and another one in India.\n\nPlumpy'Nut is distributed from the manufacturer to geographic areas of need through a complex supply chain. Forward information flows, such as projections of need, order processes, and payment information, and\nbackward information flows, including stock monitoring, quality assurance, and performance data\noccur through information exchange vulnerable to errors or tardiness associated with supply chain fragmentation.\nFactors affecting potential for loss of efficiencies in the supply chain are information flow on orders, basis of need, forecasts, flow upstream from field officers and country offices to parties controlling regional distribution and manufacturing by Nutriset, downstream flow of information on delivery times and order status.\n\nA complete two-month regimen for a child costs US$60 c. 2010.\n\nInspired by the popular Nutella spread, Plumpy'Nut was invented in 1996 by André Briend, a French paediatric nutritionist, and Michel Lescanne, a food-processing engineer. Nutella is a spread composed of sugar, modified palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skimmed milk powder, whey powder, lecithin, and vanillin. In contrast, Plumpy'Nut is a combination of peanut paste, vegetable oil and milk powder, without including chocolate, but containing sugar, vitamins and dietary minerals.\n\nSkippy may have developed a similar product in the early 1960s, according to a former employee, although it was never released.\n\nNutriset holds patents in many countries (including , published in 2002) for the production of nut-based, nutritional foods as pastes, which they have defended to prevent non-licensees in the United States from producing similar products. In places where Nutriset does not hold a patent, manufacturers of similar pastes have been stopped from exporting their products to places where Plumpy'Nut is patented. In at least 27 African nations, any non-profit (including NGOs) can make the paste and not pay a license fee.\n\nIn 2010, two US non-profit organizations unsuccessfully sued the French company in an attempt to legally produce Plumpy'Nut in the US without paying the royalty fee. Mike Mellace, president of one of the organizations claimed that “some children are dying because Nutriset prevents other companies from producing a food which could save their lives.” Invalidation of the Nutriset patent may have a positive impact on populations affected by famine, and studies by humanitarian organizations support the idea that having a single, dominant supplier in Nutriset is undesirable. Critics of Nutriset argue the US patent is “obvious in light of prior recipes” and “that the patent has essentially conferred monopoly power on Nutriset and thus violated the Sherman Act\". By definition, a patent grants a temporary monopoly, and Nutriset won the case. Some have suggested a similarity between pharmaceutical company compulsory licensing agreements, in place under the WTO TRIPS Agreement, and Plumpy'Nut.\n\nFollowing a threat of legal action against a Norwegian company that was exporting a similar product to Kenya, Nutriset was criticized by Médecins Sans Frontières, which stated in an open letter that \"Nutriset has been asked repeatedly by us and others for simple, reasonable licensing terms... Instead it appears that [Nutriset has] decided to adopt a policy of aggressive protection of [its] patents that could be considered an abuse in relation to humanitarian products.\" A UNICEF study, commissioned at Duke University and the University of North Carolina, recommended a diversified supplier base of RUTF products to better serve global needs. In response to the criticism, Nutriset has allowed companies and NGOs in some African countries to make the paste and not pay license fees.\n\n\n"}

Small to medium-sized businesses were extorted between the amounts of 35,000 to 400,000 euros each, which comprised most of ETA's 10 million euro budget in 2001.\n\nIn the Philippines most local and foreign companies pay revolutionary taxes to the Maoist \"New People's Army\". According to the army, the tax is a major obstacle for the country's development while the New People's Army justified it as a tax to be paid upon entering territories controlled by the rebels being a belligerent force.\n\nThe revolutionary taxes of Colombian guerrilla movements have become more common in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe maoist guerillas of Nepal have also widely extorted revolutionary taxes.\n\nThe Argentinian neo-Nazi organisation Movimiento Nacionalista Tacuara (MNT) demanded a \"revolutionary tax\" from Jewish shops in Buenos Aires.\n"}

The concerts were designed to allow musicians to show their support for the pro-choice movement in the United States and Canada.\n\nThe first Rock for Choice concert was organized by L7 and music editor Sue Cummings of the \"LA Weekly\", who brought their idea for a pro-choice benefit concert modeled on Bob Geldof's Live Aid.\n\nRock for Choice's first concert was held at the Hollywood Palace in Los Angeles, California on October 25, 1991, and featured Nirvana, Hole, L7, and Sister Double Happiness. Concert attendees were encouraged to speak out about women's issues from a politically progressive angle, especially abortion rights, and voter registration. Rock for Choice L7/Joan Jett concert footage and politics are featured on the rockumentary \"Not Bad for a Girl\". An after-party that followed the initial concert led Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl and members of L7 to encourage artist Jim Evans to do a poster for a future Rock For Choice show, leading to the creation of the poster group TAZ. The TAZ collective went on to do posters for some of the biggest Rock For Choice shows.\n\nThe genesis for Rock for Choice came from an interview that Sue Cummings did with L7 for the \"LA Weekly\", in which the band said they were planning to advertise one of their upcoming local shows as \"Rock for Coat Hangers\" and donate the proceeds to a pro-choice group. Sue encouraged the band to consider expanding their gig to a larger scale, contending that since there had been many benefit concerts performed in the past in the United States to help resolve famine abroad, it would be appropriate to have similar concerts raising funds for abortion access (which she saw as a more pressing and relevant issue to Americans). Cummings asked the band if they would be willing to invite other artists to play the show, contacted several feminist organizations to find a sponsor, and arranged a meeting with the Feminist Majority when they agreed to participate.\n\nThe Rock for Choice concert series originated at about the same time as the Riot Grrrl movement, made up of a new generation of feminists and rock bands originating in Olympia, Washington. Both Rock for Choice and Riot Grrrl were reacting to the early 1990s bombing of abortion clinics by certain fringe elements of the pro-life movement, and were often associated in the public's mind as a single movement, although few Riot Grrrl bands, with the exception of Bikini Kill, ever played Rock for Choice shows. But Rock for Choice formed an important cultural bridge between the baby boomer feminists of the 1970s, who had organized the Feminist Majority, and the generation X feminists of the 1990s music scene.\n\nThe concert series evolved into an organization managed by the Feminist Majority, which released a number of compilation albums featuring artists that supported Rock for Choice. The album \"\" was named based on the \"Roe v. Wade\" Supreme Court decision in 1973.\n\nThe final Rock for Choice concert was held in 2001 and was emceed by actress Gillian Anderson.\n\nArtists featured in the Rock for Choice concerts included:\n\n"}

Local star parties may be one-night affairs, but larger events can last up to a week or longer and attract hundreds or even thousands of participants. Many clubs have monthly star parties during the warmer months. Large regional star parties are held annually and are an important part of the hobby of amateur astronomy. A naturally dark site away from light pollution is typical. \n\nParticipants bring telescopes and binoculars of all types and sizes and spend the nights observing astronomical objects such as planets, comets, stars, and deep-sky objects together. Astrophotography and CCD imaging are also very popular. At larger star parties, lectures, swap meets, exhibitions of home-built telescopes, contests, tours, raffles, and other similar activities are common. Commercial vendors selling a variety of astronomical equipment may also be present. As with other hobbyist gatherings, much camaraderie and discussion of various aspects of the hobby occurs at any star party.\n\nThe idea of a star party is not new and allegedly goes back at least as far as George III of the United Kingdom, who was passionately interested in astronomy and mathematics. On nights when poor weather blocked the view of the real stars and planets, attendants are said to have hung paper lanterns marked with drawings in the trees around the royal palace to provide something else for the King and his guests to spot through their telescopes.\n\nStar parties whose focus is on bringing the stars to the people are often staged in urban areas where people congregate in large numbers. This is in contrast to star parties typically held in remote dark-sky areas more conducive to stargazing.\n\nIn the US, notable star parties include the annual Winter Star Party, held in the Florida Keys; the Mid Atlantic Star Party, held on the east coast of the United States; the Oregon Star Party; the Stellafane Convention, held in Vermont; the Texas Star Party, held in west Texas; and the Okie-Tex Star Party, held near Kenton, Oklahoma. In the United Kingdom, notable annual star parties include the Spring and Autumn Equinox star parties held at Kelling Heath Holiday Park and Kielder in Northumbria.

{"id": "33019147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33019147", "title": "The Blood Line", "text": "The Blood Line\n\n\"The Blood Line\" is the tenth and final episode of \"\", the fourth series of the British science fiction television series \"Torchwood\". It was first broadcast in the United States on Starz on 9 September 2011.\n\n\"Torchwood: Miracle Day\" follows the aftermath of a day where humanity has stopped being able to die. In the episode, a team called Torchwood seek to stop the \"Miracle\" affecting humanity's ability to die, which is engineered by a group of human families seeking to control the world.\n\nIn 2012, creator Russell T Davies announced that the show will be on indefinite hiatus, citing personal reasons, making \"The Blood Line\" the default series finale.\n\nNow aware that Jack's blood is drawn towards the Blessing, the Torchwood team uses small amounts of the blood to determine headings towards the two sites. Rex and Esther contact the CIA for assistance in infiltrating the Buenos Aires site of the Blessing, at the same time keeping Jack, Gwen, and Oswald's presence in Shanghai a secret. Director Shapiro agrees to the request and puts his team on the task, including Charlotte, who surreptitiously reports the mission to the Three Families. A detachment of the Argentinian Army under the command of Captain Federico Santos soon arrives to assist Rex and Esther, but while the group is loading up, a Three Families double agent detonates a suicide bomb, making the other soldiers Category 1 and destroying Rex and Esther's supply of Jack's blood. Rex, Esther, and Captain Santos survive unharmed, and Rex tells Santos to report that he and Esther were killed in the blast in order to better allow them to infiltrate the Blessing site.\n\nAt the CIA, Director Shapiro realizes the Three Families mole must be inside his team, and has Noah run a newly developed trace program to track any recent phone calls made using the Three Families' method of avoiding traces. Realizing she is moments from being discovered, Charlotte calmly retrieves a hidden explosive device from a side office, leaves it inside her purse in the main meeting room, and leaves. The resulting explosion 'category 1s' Shapiro and the rest of his team and lightly injures Charlotte, shielding her from any suspicion.\n\nJack, Gwen, and Oswald successfully infiltrate the Shanghai Blessing site and make their way to its exposed face, where they meet the Mother, Jilly Kitzinger, and several armed guards. The guards quickly stand down when Oswald reveals he is wearing an explosive vest (at Jack's suggestion). This advantage seems short-lived when a radio transmission from the Cousin at the Buenos Aires site reveals that Three Families operatives there have captured Esther and Rex, but when Oswald expresses that he didn't expect to leave Shanghai alive, the operatives temporarily stand down. After spending some time examining the face of the Blessing, deducing that it generates a morphic field linking the human race, Jack and Gwen question the Mother about the Miracle; she reveals that the Miracle was produced by introducing Jack's immortal blood to the Blessing- causing it to disperse immortality to the whole human race as a 'defence' to a perceived 'attack'-, and furthermore is simply the first part in a larger plan to assert control of the world. By stopping death and destabilizing the economy, the Families are now poised to take control of the banks, thereby influencing the world governments, eventually leading to a fascist oligarchy which can \"decide who lives, how long, where, and why.\"\n\nWhen Jack moves to open his veins and release his blood into the Blessing (reasoning that his now-mortal blood would 'prompt' the Blessing to restore humanity's ability to die), the Mother stops him, explaining that this will not undo the Miracle, because the original effect required Jack's blood to be introduced at both Blessing sites simultaneously. Since Rex and Esther's supply of Jack's blood was destroyed, there is no way to do this, and the Mother orders all of Torchwood killed. Before this can happen, Rex manages to interrupt and claims that he still has some of Jack's blood with him—or rather in him. Upon arrival in Buenos Aires, Esther helped Rex transfuse almost all of Jack's blood into his body, which he notes only did not kill him because of the Miracle. The Mother counters that reversing the Miracle would require almost all of the blood in both Rex and Jack's bodies, which would likely kill at least one of them once the Miracle reverted, but Rex and Jack do not back down. The Cousin then shoots Esther, telling Rex that by undoing the Miracle he will now be killing Esther forever. Rex falters, torn by his feelings for Esther, but after reassurances from Jack and Gwen he rises and opens the wound over his heart, releasing Jack's blood into the Blessing. Simultaneously Gwen shoots Jack through the heart, releasing his blood as well.\n\nThe Miracle reverts almost immediately, accompanied by an effect which Gwen calls \"a breath\": all of the world's Category 1 patients regain consciousness for a few seconds, then pass away in the next breath. This includes Gwen's father, who awakes in time to hear his wife wishing him goodbye over the phone. At the same time both of the Blessing sites begin to shake, making the structure around them unstable. Oswald grabs the Mother and urges Gwen to leave; she does, but as the exit elevator rises, Jack comes back to life. A brief struggle ensues between Jilly and Gwen before Gwen incapacitates Jilly, returns in the elevator and rescues Jack. The Mother begs Oswald to let her go, but Oswald proclaims he is happy to die and go to hell; as that is where \"all the bad little girls\" go. Jack and Gwen escape of the facility just seconds before Oswald detonates his explosives, destroying the Shanghai facility. Jilly follows close behind but falls to the ground, Jack and Gwen are unable to go back for her and she is engulfed in the explosion. The Buenos Aires team moves to leave as well, but before the Cousin can make it out, Rex regains consciousness long enough to grab him and throw him over the edge of the chasm around the Blessing. Rex falls to the ground next to Esther, the two watching each other die, but are rescued by Captain Santos and members of the Argentinian Army. Paramedics immediately start working to revive both Rex and Esther.\n\nSeveral months later, Jilly Kitzinger, having survived the destruction of the Shanghai facility, meets the Blue-Eyed Man at a familiar park bench. When she pleads that she has no place to go and no life to live, he offers her a chance to participate in the Three Families' \"Plan B\", then departs; after some delay, Jilly follows. Elsewhere, Gwen, Rhys, Jack, Charlotte and Rex attend a funeral for Esther. Afterward, as Charlotte is leaving, Rex receives recovered data from Noah's computer, and discovers the phone trace indicating that Charlotte is the mole. When Rex tries to stop her from leaving, Charlotte shoots him and is almost immediately gunned down by other agents. Jack and Gwen rush to Rex's side only to find him without a pulse, dead, but seconds later Rex gasps and regains consciousness. As he opens his shirt a stunned Jack, Gwen, and Rhys watch in shock as Rex's wounds heal completely.\n\nWhen \"The Blood Line\" premiered in the U.S on 9 September 2011, it received an audience of 0.95 million. In the UK, it fared relatively well against the viewing figure drop after Torchwood: Children of Earth with a consolidated figure of 5.13 million. \n\nVery much like the rest of the 10-part series, \"The Blood Line\" garnered a mixed response from television critics and the Torchwood fan base. The \"Guardian's\" Dan Martin noted that Torchwood finally showed its best in the series finale \"with explosions, bloodshed and forced philosophical standoffs at every turn.\" Martin also comments that the story of Gwen's dad was closed with \"class.\" \n\nHowever, Den of Geek's Simon Brew was more hesitant, claiming it was 'an otherwise busy, but rarely brilliant finale. To be clear, I didn't hate it, nor do I have an urge to pour buckets of scorn on it. But I think it was one of the least interesting episodes in the series, for the most part. And as someone's who's enjoyed Miracle Day, that was a disappointment.' On a positive note, he did also say in regards to the open-ended cliffhanger, ' Torchwood has been very good at burning bridges at the end of its series, with finales that force the show to move to a new place for the following run.' \n\nIn a negative review for Uproxx, Alan Sepinwall said 'the season was too far gone for the finale to do much in the way of redeeming it, but we at least could have gone out on an interesting note. Instead, there were lots of explosions, lots of yelling, and very little that held my attention or made me feel anything in the way that, say, some of the sacrifices in \"Children of Earth\" did.' He also criticised the effect of the cliffhanger, saying 'so it turns out that this huge world-changing event was just a \"trial run\" for an even bigger plan on the part of the bad guys? Does anyone (other than Davies) think that what the series needs is to get even bigger?'\n"}

Vinoth and produced by S. R. Prakashbabu and S. R. Prabhu of Dream Warrior Pictures. The story is based on true events from the Operation Bawaria case, which involved the nefarious activity of dacoits and its eventual containment by Tamil Nadu police. Karthi and Rakul Preet Singh play the lead roles in this movie, while Abhimanyu Singh played the prime antagonist. Along with the Telugu dubbed version titled \"Khakee - The Power of Police\", the film was released on 17 November 2017. A Hindi dubbed version titled \"Theeran\" was released on YouTube by Goldmines Telefilms on 24 June 2018.\n\nThe film begins with a scene from a police station where Sasi, the police officer in charge, orders that the documented criminal cases in the form of manuscripts be converted into digital format. During this process he comes across a really spine chilling dacoity murder case from several years ago. After reading the case history, he calls up the police officer who had taken charge of the case, Theeran Thirumaran (Karthi).\n\nThe story shifts to the year 1995, where Theeran is in his police training college undergoing training to be posted as DSP from TNPSC (Tamil Nadu Public Service Commission) exams. He tops the training period. Simultaneously, in a house along the highway of Tamil Nadu, a group of dacoits wreck the house by barging in killing all the people inside gruesomely and taking the belongings.\n\nMeanwhile, Theeran returns to his hometown of Tanjavur, falls in love with his new neighbor Priya (Rakul Preet Singh), and marries her. Later, Theeran becomes known in the police department for his ways of handling various cases and he is later moved to Ponneri after a dacoital attack. Police Inspector Satya (Bose Venkat) and Theeran both handle the case, but lead nowhere with the case. Therefore, in 2003, Theeran, Sathya, and a group of other police officers go around India to see if they are able to identify the fingerprints of the dacoits. During this process Theeran learns that these dacoits are actually tribe members of the left over cultural groups after the Indian Independence. They are eventually stopped by the carelessness of their superior officers and the case is put on hold.\n\nLater in 2003 the dacoits raid the house of the ruling party's MLA and kill him. The government is under heavy pressure from the public, and the Home Minister gives Theeran all powers and a full team to nab the dacoits. A year later, they find one fingerprint match in Uttar Pradesh prison and go to a lorry station to capture the dacoit. Learning that the lorry has left and it is heading to Ponneri, Theeran and the other officers rush to stop them. The dacoits raid Sathya's house and kill his wife (Sonia), and also injure Priya and put her in a coma.\n\nAngered by this incident, Theeran, with the help of higher officials, puts together a team to capture the gang of dacoits lead by Oma (Abhimanyu Singh). They camp in Rajasthan with the help of a local police officer. They come to know that the gang members except Oma are in their village so they visit the village only to be sent out by the villagers. While the case is going on, Theeran learns that Priya died. This fuels his anger, which makes him even more motivated to find Oma. The team learns that there is a way to bring Oma out from his village. So he captures the organizer of the gang and one of the gang members and puts them in police custody. Infuriated Oma vows to kill Theeran and his team. Theeran gets information that Oma will be on a train which is infiltrated by the team, but Oma escapes to a nearby village. Theeran and his team walk to the village and reside there for the night. Oma's gang infiltrates the village, destroying it and killing Theeran's teammates. Finally, Theeran captures Oma, brings him to Tamil Nadu, and gets him a death sentence.\n\nNow in 2017, it is revealed that Theeran has a boring useless post in the Traffic Vigilance Department because he is straightforward and lives alone. Theeran is visited by Sathya, Sathya's daughter, and Sasi. Sasi salutes him. The movie ends with a note conveying \"The film is dedicated to all the people in the police department who fought and arrested those dacoits, and we thank them for their bravery and courage. The officers involved in this case were not recognized by the government by providing any honorary awards, neither were they promoted to higher posts\".\n\nFollowing the success of his first film \"Sathuranga Vettai\" (2014), director H. Vinoth was keen to make a sequel to the film starring either Suriya or Ajith Kumar, but their reluctance meant that he moved on to work on a different project based on the Operation Bawaria case. He stated that he had the idea of making a film on the case before he made \"Sathuranga Vettai\" but had forgot about it until he opened a food parcel, which was coincidentally covered with a newspaper article narrating the events of the operation and the incident subsequently inspired him to work on the script. In February 2016, he approached Karthi to play the lead role in the police drama film and was insistent that the final version carried the same \"social responsibility angle\" that the initial script had carried. Karthi expressed his immediate interest in working on the film, and recalled that he had first heard about the case while he was working on the making of \"Siruthai\" (2011). Vinoth continued to script the film throughout 2016, while Karthi finished his pending work for \"Kaashmora\" (2016) and Mani Ratnam's \"Kaatru Veliyidai\" (2017). Titled \"Theeran Adhigaram Ondru\", Rakul Preet Singh was signed to play the leading female role in the film. Bose Venkat was also selected to portray a police officer in the film, with the actor stating that the role gave him \"a new dimension and a new identity\". Abhimanyu Singh was selected to portray the main antagonist, while Telugu actor Narra Srinivas made his debut in Tamil cinema by playing a police officer. Sathyan Sooryan was selected to handle the cinematography for the film, while Dhilip Subbarayan and Kathir were signed to handle the stunt and art departments respectively. For Karthi's costumes in the film, the team actively chose to use organic cotton shirts after being recommended to by Karthi's mother, Lakshmi Sivakumar. S. R. Prabhu's Dream Warrior Pictures agreed to produce the film, with the shoot announced to begin in January 2017.\n\nTo prepare for his role, Karthi underwent police training at the YMCA Campus in Chennai before production began. The film was shot in several cities across North India including Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bhuj, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. Actress Scarlett Mellish Wilson shot for an item number in April 2017 at Jaisalmer Fort in Rajasthan, with the song being choreographed by Brindha. As a result of the warm climate, several of the film's cast and crew fell sick during the making of the project. To make the film as authentic as possible, Vinoth actively hired artistes from the regions and insisted on shooting in such locations, rather than replicating the terrains in Chennai or in studios.\n\nThe film depicts Operation Bawaria, the investigation of a series of dacoity cases by the Tamil Nadu Police Department. The operation led to the gunning down of two members of a criminal gang belonging to the Bawariya tribe from Uttar Pradesh as well as further arrests in the 2000s. Armed dacoits had struck affluent houses along National Highways in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The operation against the criminals was officially launched in January 2005 soon after the murder of AIADMK MLA Sudarsanam from Gummidipoondi. A special team led by the then Director General of Police S.R.Jangid, worked in coordination with the Uttar Pradesh Police and intelligence agencies to track down the wanted criminals — Oma Bawaria, Bsura Bawaria, and Vijay Bawaria among others. The teams worked for several weeks to put together information and camped in remote locations in Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab before gunning down Bsura Bawaria and Vijay Bawaria. The other prime suspects, Oma Bawaria, and K. Lakshman alias Ashok Bawaria, were then arrested and brought to Tamil Nadu where they were convicted and awarded the death penalty by a special court.\n\nThe movie was made in close consultation with Jangid and the other officers involved in the operation. Post-release of the film, Jangid appreciated the team for their realistic portrayal of events and praised the director's research for the film.\n\nThe film's score and soundtrack were composed by Ghibran, with the album being released by Aditya Music on 2 November 2017. The songs were featured in full in the album, while only partially featured in the film.\n\nThe movie was released on 17 November 2017. The satellite rights were sold to Star Vijay. Amazon has acquired the digital rights.\n\nThe movie received positive reviews from critics. \"The Times of India\" gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote: \"Right from the beginning, when we see cop Theeran Thirumaran (a splendid Karthi) looking back on a case that was the biggest challenge of his career (this indifferent framing device is one of the film's rare missteps), \"Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru\" grips us by the scruff of our necks and never lets go.\" \"Behindwoods.com\" gave 3 out of 5 and wrote: \"Karthi and Vinoth will make you wait for the sequel\" \n\n"}

It was restored again in 2003 and continues to be used for opera and other performances.\n\n"}
{"id": "30367887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30367887", "title": "Time travel claims and urban legends", "text": "Time travel claims and urban legends\n\nThere have been various accounts of persons who allegedly travelled through time reported by the press or circulated on the Internet. These reports have generally turned out either to be hoaxes or to be based on incorrect assumptions, incomplete information, or interpretation of fiction as fact, many being now recognized as urban legends.\n\nThe Moberly–Jourdain incident, or the Ghosts of Petit Trianon or Versailles ( / \"les fantômes de Versailles\") refers to claims of time travel and hauntings made by Charlotte Anne Moberly (1846–1937) and Eleanor Jourdain (1863–1924). In 1911, Moberly and Jourdain published a book entitled \"An Adventure\", under the names of \"Elizabeth Morison\" and \"Frances Lamont\". Their book describes a visit they made to the \"Petit Trianon\", a small \"château\" in the grounds of the Palace of Versailles where they claimed they saw ghosts including Marie Antoinette and others. Their story caused a sensation, and was subject to much ridicule.\n\nIn October 2010, Northern Irish filmmaker George Clarke uploaded a video clip entitled \"Chaplin's Time Traveller\" to YouTube. The clip analyzes bonus material in a DVD of the Charlie Chaplin film \"The Circus\". Included in the DVD is footage from the film's Los Angeles premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in 1928. At one point, a woman is seen walking by, holding up an object to her ear. Clarke said that, on closer examination, she was talking into a thin, black device that had appeared to be a \"phone\". Clarke concluded that the woman was possibly a time traveller. The clip received millions of hits and was the subject of televised news stories.\n\nNicholas Jackson, associate editor for \"The Atlantic\", says the most likely answer is that she was using a portable hearing aid, a technology that was just being developed at the time. Philip Skroska, an archivist at the Bernard Becker Medical Library of Washington University in St. Louis, thought that the woman might have been holding a rectangular ear trumpet. \"New York Daily News\" writer Michael Sheridan said the device was probably an early hearing aid, perhaps manufactured by Acousticon.\n\nA photograph from 1941 of genuine authenticity of the re-opening of the South Fork Bridge in Gold Bridge, British Columbia, was alleged to show a time traveler. It was claimed that his clothing and sunglasses were of the present day and not of the styles worn in the 40s.\n\nFurther research suggested that the present day appearance of the man may not have been so new. The style of sunglasses first appeared in the 1920s. On first glance the man is taken by many to be wearing a printed T-shirt, but on closer inspection it seems to be a sweater with a sewn-on emblem, the kind of clothing often worn by sports teams of the period. The shirt is very similar to the one that was used by the Montreal Maroons, an ice hockey team from that era. The remainder of his clothing would appear to have been available at the time, though his clothes are far more casual than those worn by the other individuals in the photograph.\n\nDebate centres on whether the image genuinely shows a time traveller, has been Photoshopped or is simply being mistaken as anachronistic. The \"Time Traveling Hipster\" became a case study in viral Internet phenomena in museums which was presented at the Museums and the Web 2011 conference in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe story of Rudolph Fentz is an urban legend from the early 1950s and has been repeated since as a reproduction of facts and presented as evidence for the existence of time travel. The essence of the legend is that in New York City in 1951 a man wearing 19th-century clothes was hit by a car. The subsequent investigation revealed that the man had disappeared without trace in 1876. The items in his possession suggested that the man had traveled through time from 1876 to 1950 directly.\n\nThe folklorist Chris Aubeck investigated the story and found it originated in a science fiction book of the 1950s, \"A Voice from the Gallery\" by Ralph M. Holland, which had copied the tale from \"I'm Scared\", a short story by Jack Finney (1911–1995), from which the Fentz tale originated.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2001, an online bulletin board user self-identified as John Titor became popular as he claimed to be a time traveler from 2036 on a military mission. Holding the many-worlds interpretation as correct and consequently every time travel paradox as impossible, he stated that many events which occurred up to his time would indeed occur in this timeline. These included a devastating civil war in the US in 2008 followed by a short nuclear World War III in 2015.\n\nIn the years following his last posts and disappearance in 2001, the non-fulfilment of his specific predictions made his popularity decrease. Criticism has pointed out flaws in Titor's stories and investigations suggested his character may be a hoax and a creation of two siblings from Florida.\n\nTo date, the story has been retold on numerous web sites, in a book, in the Japanese visual novel/anime \"Steins;Gate\", and in a play. He may also have been discussed occasionally on the radio show \"Coast to Coast AM\". In this respect, the Titor story may be unique in terms of broad appeal from an originally limited medium, an Internet discussion board.\n\nSimilar to John Titor, Bob White or Tim Jones sent an unknown number of spam emails onto the internet between 2001 and 2003. The subject of the emails was always the same, that the individual was seeking to find someone who could supply a \"Dimensional Warp Generator.\" In some instances, he claimed to be a time traveler stuck in 2003, and in others he claimed to be seeking the parts only from other time travelers. Several recipients began to respond in kind, claiming to have equipment such as the requested dimensional warp generator. One recipient, Dave Hill, set up an online shop from which the time traveler purchased the warp generator (formerly a Hard Drive Motor), while another Dave charged thousands of dollars for time-travel \"courses\" before he would sell the requested hardware. \n\nThe name \"Bob White\" was taken from an alias that the second Dave used when responding (a reference to the \"Bobwhites\" of Trixie Belden-fame).\nSoon afterward, the time traveler was identified as professional spammer Robert J. Todino (known as \"Robby\"). Todino's attempts to travel in time were a serious belief, and while he believed he was \"perfectly mentally stable,\" his father was concerned that those replying to his mails had been preying on Todino's psychological problems. \n\nIn his book \"Spam Kings\", journalist Brian S. McWilliams, who had originally uncovered Todino's identity for \"Wired\" magazine, revealed that Todino had been previously diagnosed with dissociative disorder and schizophrenia, explaining the psychological problems his father had spoken of. Todino's time traveller was referenced in the song \"Rewind\" by jazz trio Groovelily on their 2003 album \"Are we there yet?\" The song used phrases taken from Todino's emails within its lyrics.\n\nAndrew Carlssin was reportedly arrested in March 2003 for SEC violations for making 126 high-risk stock trades and being successful on every one. As reported, Carlssin started with an initial investment of $800 and ended with over $350,000,000 which drew the attention of the SEC. Later reports suggest that after his arrest, he submitted a four-hour confession wherein he claimed to be a time traveller from 200 years in the future. He offered to tell investigators such things as the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden and the cure for AIDS in return for a lesser punishment and to be allowed to return to his time craft, although he refused to tell investigators the location or workings of his craft.\n\nThe Carlssin story allegedly originated as a fictional piece in \"Weekly World News\", a satirical newspaper, and was later repeated by Yahoo! News, where its fictitious nature became less apparent. It was soon reported by other newspapers and magazines as fact. This in turn drove word-of-mouth spread through email inboxes and internet forums, leading to far more detailed descriptions of events.\n\nA video uploaded in 2006 shows a Swedish man named Håkan Nordkvist claiming that he had been accidentally transported to 2046 when attempting to fix the sink in his kitchen. There in the future, he immediately met someone who revealed and proved to be himself about 70 years old, and with whom he \"had a great time\". He filmed a short footage of the two smiling and hugging each other and showing the tattoo they had in their right arm. The story was reportedly a marketing campaign promoting the pension plans of the insurance company AMF.\n\nIn 1921, Paul Amadeus Dienach, a Swiss-Austrian teacher fell into coma for a year. When he woke up, he began writing a diary that he kept secret until he contacted one of his students, Georgios Papachatzis, to translate it and keep it secret. In his writings, he claims to have awakened in the body of a man, Andrew Northman, in the year 3906 AD. According to the author, when awakened in the future, people realized that it was not Northman, and told him the events during the future period.\n\nChronovisor was the name given to a machine that was said to be capable of viewing past and future events. Its existence was alleged by Father François Brune, author of several books on paranormal phenomena and religion. In his 2002 book \"The Vatican’s New Mystery\" he claimed that the device had been built by the Italian priest and scientist Father Pellegrino Maria Ernetti. While Father Ernetti was a real person, the existence (much less the functionality) of the chronovisor has never been confirmed.\n\nIn April 2013, the Iranian news agency Fars carried a story claiming a 27-year-old Iranian scientist had invented a time machine that allowed people to see into the future. A few days later, the story was removed, and replaced with a story quoting an Iranian government official that no such device had been registered.\n\nThe Philadelphia Experiment is the name given to a naval military experiment which was supposedly carried out at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, sometime around October 28, 1943. It is alleged that the U.S. Navy destroyer escort USS \"Eldridge\" was to be rendered invisible (or \"cloaked\") to enemy devices. The experiment is also referred to as Project Rainbow. Some reports allege that the warship travelled back in time for about 10 seconds; however, popular culture has represented far bigger time jumps.\n\nThe story is widely regarded as a hoax. The U.S. Navy maintains that no such experiment occurred, and details of the story contradict well-established facts about the \"Eldridge\" as well as the known laws of physics.\n\nThe Montauk Project was alleged to be a series of secret United States government projects conducted at Camp Hero or Montauk Air Force Station on Montauk, Long Island, for the purpose of exotic research, including time travel. Jacques Vallée describes allegations of the Montauk Project as an outgrowth of stories about the Philadelphia Experiment.\n"}

The show took place on June 5, 2003 in Naucalpan, Mexico. The Main event featured an Eight-man \"Atómicos\" tag team match where the team of Lizmark, La Parka, Octagón and Super Caló faced the team of Abismo Negro, Cibernético and The Headhunters.\n\nIn early 1992 Antonio Peña was working as a booker and storyline writer for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to \"lucha libre\". He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them the recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create Asistencia Asesoría y Administración later simply known as \"AAA\" or Triple A. After making a deal with the \"Televisa\" television network AAA held their first show in April 1992. The following year Peña and AAA held their first Triplemanía event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's Super Bowl event, similar to the WWE's WrestleMania being the biggest show of the year. The 2003 Triplemanía was the 11th year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the 16th overall show under the Triplemanía banner.\n\nThe Triplemanía XI show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\n"}

James Echols was the show chairman and president of event sponsor Uncommon Solutions. This combination of media, comics, and literary guests with gaming, art, anime, and film was an ambitious attempt to create a large convention with regional and national appeal. UnCommonCon suffered financial collapse just before the 2001 event.\n\nThe first UnCommonCon, UnCommonCon 2000, was held November 24–26, 2000, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel-DFW Airport located by Terminal C at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Guests included author Aaron Allston, author Tracy Hickman, author P.N. Elrod, actor Ted Raimi, Melissa Benson, \"Babylon 5\" actor Jason Carter, \"Hulk\" actor Lou Ferrigno, actor Victor Lundin, artist Bryan Talbot, and many more. Screenings included \"Babylon Park\" and \"Laughing Boy\". Organizers were reported to have expected attendance of around 4000 but only 1200 people actually attended.\n\nThe second UnCommonCon, UnCommonCon 2001, was scheduled to be held November 23–25, 2001, at the Wyndham Anatole Hotel in Dallas, Texas. Scheduled guests included author Aaron Allston, artist Sergio Aragones, author Lee Martindale, and author Michael Stackpole. The first major auction by Heritage Auctions was scheduled to be held in conjunction with the convention. There were several factors, including a sharp drop in domestic travel after 9/11, that led to cancellation of the event roughly two weeks before the second convention was to occur but organizers publicly blamed slow dealer tables sales and their failure to meet room block commitments resulting in a $60,000 invoice from the hotel.\n\nWhen UnCommonCon failed unexpectedly due to financial difficulties, A-Kon sponsors Phoenix Entertainment stepped in with Itzacon. This event was hurriedly put together and \"inherited\" a number of guests from the UnCommonCon roster who had already completed travel plans for this Thanksgiving weekend. Con organizer Meri Hazlewood later claimed a paid attendance of \"about 540 people (not counting dealers and staff).\"\n\nHeritage Comic Auctions held its \"million dollar\" comics and movie poster auction, as scheduled, at the Wyndham Anatole.

{"id": "1575849", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1575849", "title": "Vaudeville Theatre", "text": "Vaudeville Theatre\n\nThe Vaudeville Theatre is a West End theatre on the Strand in the City of Westminster. As the name suggests, the theatre held mostly vaudeville shows and musical revues in its early days. It opened in 1870 and was rebuilt twice, although each new building retained elements of the previous structure. The current building opened in 1926, and the capacity is now 690 seats. Rare \"thunder drum\" and \"lightning sheets\", together with other early stage mechanisms, survive in the theatre.\n\nThe theatre was designed by prolific architect C. J. Phipps, and decorated in a Romanesque style by George Gordon. It opened on 16 April 1870 with Andrew Halliday's comedy, \"For Love Or Money\" and a burlesque, \"Don Carlos or the Infante in Arms\". A notable innovation was the concealed footlights, which would shut off if the glass in front of them was broken. The owner, William Wybrow Robertson, had run a failing billiard hall on the site but saw more opportunity in theatre. He leased the new theatre to three actors, Thomas Thorne, David James, and H.J. Montague. The original theatre stood behind two houses on the Strand, and the entrance was through a labyrinth of small corridors. It had a seating capacity of 1,046, rising in a horseshoe over a pit and three galleries. The cramped site meant that facilities front and backstage were limited.\n\nThe great Shakespearean actor, Henry Irving, had his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in James Albery's \"Two Roses\" at the Vaudeville in 1870. It held the theatre for what was at the time an extraordinarily successful run of 300 nights. The first theatre piece in the world to achieve 500 consecutive performances was the comedy \"Our Boys\" by H. J. Byron, which started its run at the Vaudeville in 1875. The production went on to surpass the 1,000 performance mark. This was such a rare event that London bus conductors approaching the Vaudeville Theatre stop shouted \"Our Boys!\" instead of the name of the theatre.\nIn 1882, Thomas Thorne became the sole lessee, and in 1889 he demolished the houses to create a foyer block in the Adamesque style, behind a Portland stone facade on the Strand. He again used architect C.J. Phipps. The theatre was refurbished to have more spacious seating and an ornate ceiling. It reopened on 13 January 1891 with a performance of Jerome K. Jerome's comedy, \"Woodbarrow Farm\", preceded by Herbert Keith's one-act play \"The Note of Hand\". This foyer is preserved today, as is the four-storey frontage. Dramatist W. S. Gilbert presented one of his later plays here, \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern\" (1891), a burlesque \"in Three Short 'Tableaux'\". (He had published it in 1874 in \"Fun magazine\"). Also in 1891, Elizabeth Robins and Marion Lea directed and starred in Ibsen's \"Hedda Gabler\" at the theatre, and his \"Rosmersholm\" had its London premiere here.\n\nIn 1892, Thorne passed the lease to restaurateurs Agostino and Stefano Gatti, who since 1878 had held the lease of the nearby Adelphi Theatre. The first production at the new theatre was a revival of \"Our Boys\". The lease briefly passed into the hands of Weedon Grossmith in 1894, but was back with the Gattis in 1896. The theatre became known for a series of successful musical comedies. \"The French Maid\", by Basil Hood, with music by Walter Slaughter, first played in London at Terry's Theatre under the management of W.H. Griffiths beginning in 1897 but transferred to the Vaudeville in early 1898, running for a very successful total of 480 London performances. The piece starred Louie Pounds. Seymour Hicks and his wife Ellaline Terriss starred in a series of Christmas entertainments here, including their popular \"Bluebell in Fairyland\" (1901). The foyer of the theatre had become infamous as the site of an argument in 1897 between Richard Archer Prince and Terriss's father, actor William Terriss. Soon after that argument, the deranged Prince stabbed William Terriss to death at the stage door of the Adelphi Theatre. Prince was a struggling young actor whom Terriss had tried to help.\nHicks and Terriss also starred here in \"Quality Street\", a comedy by J. M. Barrie, which opened at the Vaudeville in 1902 and ran for 459 performances. It had first played in New York in 1901 but ran there for only 64 performances. This was one of the first American productions to score a bigger triumph in London. This was followed by the 1903 musical \"The Cherry Girl\" by Hicks, with music by Ivan Caryll, starring Hicks, Terriss and Courtice Pounds. In 1904, Hicks scored an even bigger hit with the musical, \"The Catch of the Season\", written by Hicks and Cosmo Hamilton, based on the fairy tale \"Cinderella\". It had a very long run of 621 performances, starring Hicks, Zena Dare (who created the role of Angela when Ellaline Terriss's pregnancy forced her to withdraw. Dare was later replaced by Terriss and then by Dare's sister, Phyllis Dare) and Louie Pounds.\n\nJohn Maria and Rocco Gatti took over management of the Vaudeville in 1905. In 1906, the theatre hosted the very successful \"The Belle of Mayfair\", a musical composed by Leslie Stuart with a book by Basil Hood, Charles Brookfield and Cosmo Hamilton, produced by Hicks' partner, Charles Frohman. It ran for 431 performances and starred Edna May, Louie and her brother Courtice Pounds, and Camille Clifford. In 1910, an English adaptation of \"The Girl in the Train\" (\"Die geschiedene Frau\" – literally, \"The Divorcee\"), a 1908 Viennese operetta by Leo Fall, opened at the Vaudeville. It was produced by George Edwardes, with lyrics by Adrian Ross and starred Robert Evett, Phyllis Dare and Rutland Barrington. In 1911, William Greet produced \"Baby Mine\" at the theatre. Betty Bolton made her debut in 1916, at the age of 10, in a revue called \"Some\", at the theatre. During and after World War I, audiences sought light entertainment, and musical revues held the Vaudeville stage, including \"Cheep\" (1917), the long-running \"Just Fancy\" (1920) and \"Rats\" (1923), another popular revue. Albert Ketèlbey was one of the theatre's music directors.\nThe theatre closed on 7 November 1925, when the interior was completely reconstructed to designs by Robert Atkinson. The auditorium was changed from a horseshoe shape to the current rectangle shape, and the seating capacity reduced to just over 700. A new dressing room block with an ornate boardroom extended the site to Maiden Lane. The theatre reopened on 23 February 1926, with a popular revue by Archie de Bear called \"R.S.V.P.\", notable because its final rehearsal was broadcast by the BBC. The theatre then hosted William Somerset Maugham's comedy, \"The Bread-Winner\" in 1930. After World War II, the theatre presented William Douglas Home's play, \"The Chiltern Hundreds\", which ran for 651 performances. The record-setting musical \"Salad Days\", composed by Julian Slade with lyrics by Dorothy Reynolds and Slade, premiered at the Bristol Old Vic in 1954 but soon transferred to the Vaudeville, enjoying the longest run of any theatrical work up to that point in history. Another notable production at the theatre was Arnold Wesker's 1959 play, \"Chips with Everything\".\n\nA proposed redevelopment of Covent Garden by the GLC in 1968 saw the theatre under threat, together with the nearby Adelphi, Garrick, Lyceum and Duchess theatres. An active campaign by Equity, the Musicians' Union and theatre owners under the auspices of the \"Save London Theatres Campaign\" led to the abandonment of the scheme.\n\nCicely Courtneidge played at the theatre in \"The Bride Comes Back\" (1960) and Ray Cooney's \"Move Over Mrs. Markham\" (1971). Bill Treacher made his West End debut in 1963 in the comedy \"Shout for Life\" at the Vaudeville. In 1966, the theatre hosted \"Arsenic and Old Lace\", starring Sybil Thorndike and her husband Lewis Casson. Brigid Brophy's \"The Burglar\" premiered at the theatre in 1967, and Joyce Rayburn's comedy, \"The Man Most Likely To...\", starring Leslie Phillips, opened initially at the Vaudeville in 1968 and went on to run for over 1,000 performances in London.\n\nIn 1969, the Gatti family sold their interest in the theatre to Sir Peter Saunders, and in 1970 he commissioned Peter Rice to redesign the interior. Among other changes were a deep red wallpaper in the auditorium and more comfortable seats. Also, the loggia above the street was glazed to make the balcony an extension of the bar. The backstage lighting was rerigged, and a forestage lift and counterweight flying system were installed. The theatre achieved some protection in 1972 when it was Grade II listed. In 1983, ownership passed to Michael Codron and David Sutton. Stephen Waley-Cohen took ownership in 1996, passing it to Max Weitzenhofer in 2002.\n\nMeanwhile, drama was added to the standard bill of fare at the theatre. Hugh Paddick starred in the Joyce Rayburn farce \"Out on a Limb\" at the theatre in 1976, Noël Coward's \"Present Laughter\" with Donald Sinden in the lead was revived in 1981 and Patrick Cargill and Moira Lister co-starred in the farce \"Key for Two\" in 1982. Noël Coward's \"Blithe Spirit\" was revived at the theatre in 1986, and Willy Russell's play \"Shirley Valentine\" played in 1988, starring Pauline Collins. In 1990, Simon Gray's play \"Hidden Laughter\" was produced at the theatre, followed by Kander and Ebb's 1991 musical, \"70, Girls, 70\", starring Dora Bryan.\n\nA 1996 revival of \"Salad Days\", starring the duo Kit and The Widow, was not successful, but Jean Fergusson's show \"She Knows You Know!\", in which she portrayed the Lancashire comedian Hylda Baker, played at the theatre in 1997 and was nominated for a 1998 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment. \"Showtune\", a musical revue celebrating the words and music of composer Jerry Herman and conceived by Paul Gilger was given a London production at the Vaudeville in 1998 under its previous title \"The Best of Times\". That same year the theatre housed \"Kat and the Kings\", which won the Olivier for Best New Musical and, in an unusual move, Best Actor in a Musical for its entire cast. \"Madame Melville\", a play by Richard Nelson was presented in 2000. It marked the return of Macaulay Culkin to acting after a six-year hiatus and also starred Irène Jacob and Madeleine Potter. In 2001 Ray Cooney's farce \"Caught in the Net\", starring Russ Abbot and Eric Sykes, had a ten-month run.\n\nThe dance/performance art troupe \"Stomp\" was in residence at the theatre from 2002 to 2007. Since 2003, the theatre has been owned by Max Weitzenhoffer, and in 2005, the venue was brought under the management of Nimax Theatres Limited.\n\nAs minstrel shows shifted towards the development of vaudeville theatre, the comedic and misogynistic “wench” also experienced a shift into more of a serious and creative character, the “prima donna.” By the end of the Prohibition Era, vaudeville shows featured female impersonators as a regular part of their performance, in which further became a new popular trend of public entertainment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is situated on Great Clowes Street, on the corner of the Elton Street. The theatre officially opened 10 December 1900 and was last in use as a bingo hall in 2008. The original capacity was 2,000 seated, this was increased to 3,000 in 1910. Palatial Leisure Limited sold the building in September 2018.\n\nThe Victoria Theatre, designed by Bertie Crewe, was built by The Broughton Theatres Syndicate Ltd, the same syndicate which controlled the Regent Theatre, Cross Lane, Salford (destroyed by fire in 1952). The building's foundation stone was laid on 4 October 1899 by the actor Sir Henry Irving. Accompanying Irving was Bram Stoker, also in attendance were Bertie Crewe, the Civic Mayor of Salford Samuel Rudman, Frederick Platt-Higgins (Conservative MP for Salford North), C. V. Haworth (chairman of the syndicate), a large number of the members from the Salford Corporation, and former Civic Mayors of Salford Sir W. H. Bailey and Sir Richard Mottram. Crewe presented Irving with a mallet and a silver trowel. In a short speech Irving remarked, \"I have always contended that a well-conducted playhouse is a centre of rational recreation, and without rational recreation no community can pretend to have its facultics in proper order.\"\n\nWhen the application for the theatre's licence was heard by the town council, Mr. J. Broxap put forward an amendment, \"That the resolution of the Watch Committee be approved subject to no application being made to the Excise for the licence to sell intoxicating drink.\" The amendment was seconded by Mr. Haworth who added, \"Persons who went in and out to get drink interrupted the performance, to the annoyance of those who desired to see the piece.\" The council voted 25 for the amendment to alter the theatre's licence so that alcohol could not be sold, 32 against and 1 abstention. The Mayor declared the amendment lost.\n\nThe 2,000 seater theatre opened on 10 December 1900 with the play \"\"Sign of the Cross\",\" performed by William Greet's company, with Edward Vincent as the Prefect and Virginia Buckle as the Christian girl Mercia. The front of the theatre was described as \"red terra-cotta, divided by Ionic pilasters into five bays\" and the foyer was described as \"a hall 34 feet long and 18 feet wide, with marble mosaic floor, walls panelled in fibrous plaster, and hand-painted ceiling\". The dimensions of the stage were also recorded as \"Its width is 74 feet, the distance from the curtain line to the back wall is 40 feet, the distance from stage to grid is 50 feet, and the proscenium opening is 30 feet in width.\n\nIn November 1901, less than a year after opening, the theatre began showing films and in 1913 it was granted a cinema licence. The owner/managers, Messrs J. P. Moore & Montague Beadyn, also increased the capacity in 1910 from 2,000 to 3,000. However, from 1917 to 1919 the venue became a theatre once more.\n\nIn 1919 the theatre consultant Mr. Watson redesigned the auditorium with interior paintings and a Tudor Café and the theatre became predominantly a cinema again under H. D. Moorhouse, and remained a cinema until its closure in July 1958. The owner/managers from 1945 were Broughton Cinemas Ltd.\n\nFollowing the cinema's closure in July 1958 the theatre was used as a clothing / furniture store with some performances by repertory groups, including Venture Productions, and pantomimes being staged during the 1960s.\n\nFrom the mid 1960s until the summer of 1971, the theatre was owned by a Salford businessman, Councillor Sam Goldberg. Goldberg allowed repertory groups such as Venture Productions to put on productions rent free. He also used the theatre as winter headquarters for his own Southport Repertory Company. Goldberg tried unsuccessfully to sell the freehold to Salford City Council, in the hope that they might operate the building as a civic theatre and arts centre. Talks stalled after it was estimated that the cost of modernising the building could be about £80,000, the theatre was running at a loss at the time of Goldberg's death. Councillor Cecil Franks, the chairman, said it was hopeless to try to maintain a \"Victorian relic\" of this size in its present form. Goldberg died prior to the North Manchester Amateur Operatic Society's production of \"The Quaker Girl\", May–June 1971, (music by Lionel Monckton, lyrics by Adrian Ross and Percy Greenbank), the theatre then lay dark.\n\nAfter a brief unsuccessful attempt to run the venue as a bingo hall in 1973 the theatre closed again. It then remained dark until the 1980s when a second attempt was successful and the bingo hall remained open until 2008. The theatre became a Grade II Listed Building on 18 January 1980. During its time as a bingo hall in the 1980s the building was severely damaged when its third floor was removed and replaced with a less ornate brick wall.\n\nPalatial Leisure Limited closed down Victoria Bingo Hall in 2008 and have since carried out work on the roof; however, urgent repairs are currently needed to deal with the plant growth on the venue's facade. The front canopy was also destroyed after a truck collided with it.\n\nIn 2012 Palatial Leisure Limited decided to put the theatre on the market for £275,000. In the same year the Theatres Trust placed the Victoria Theatre (Salford) on their Theatre Buildings at Risk (TBAR) register, although it was in the lowest of their four categories. The Theatres Trust noted that several of the theatre's original features are still intact, \"There are substantial remains of wooden sub-stage machinery with paddle levers and the construction for corner traps and four bridges. The grave trap is complete with its platform.\"; they also noted the need for regeneration in the area surrounding the theatre.\n\nA 'Save Victoria Theatre Campaign Meeting' was held on 1 August 2012 at the Robert Powell Theatre, University of Salford. The meeting resulted in the formation of a community group, Save the Victoria Theatre Salford (SVTS). In the group were David Dewsnip, a production technician at the University of Salford, who called the meeting, and Allen Christey, an electrical engineer, who was involved in a failed attempt to save the theatre from being turned into a bingo hall in 1971. Following the meeting a steering group was set up with Dewsnip and Christey as joint leaders, the rest of the steering group was named as: Roland Metcalf, Bob Howorth, Mary Ferrer, Estelle Neuman and Cath Connett. However concerns have been raised about how the members of the steering group were selected, such as the non-inclusion of Micky Dacks, and whether or not \"the community is being used for the benefit of Salford University\".\n\nIn February 2013 Save the Victoria Theatre Salford formed Save the Victoria Theatre Trust (SVTT) to take forward the potential purchase, refurbishment and reopening of the building. The trust was initially composed of Dewsnip, Christey, Howorth, Ferrer, and John Lucas. Palatial Leisure is willing to sell the building to SVTT but they are unable to afford it. In May 2015 Salford City Council visited the site with a view to serving an Urgent Works Notice. However, the visit showed no evidence of water penetration so the council is considering other options and actions. These have yet to be determined and in the meantime the building is subject to continued deterioration. Ferrer resigned from the trust in January 2014 and Lucas resigned in January 2015. Two new directors, Samantha Kelly and Ray Walker, were appointed in November 2015.\nIn December 2017 \"Quays News\" reported that SVTT was being relaunched with the support of Salford City Council's mayor Paul Dennett and the local MP Graham Stringer. However in September 2018 the theatre was put up for auction with a guide price of £350,000 which prompted the SVTT to campaign to have the building recognized as an 'asset of community value'. The council's \"Draft Local Plan\" (2016) document promised protection for the building, \"securing its positive reuse, preferably for a community use in keeping with its original function and design\", but its sale has caused concern within SVTT that the revised plan, due to be published in November 2018, will include a plan to demolish the theatre.\n\nThe current stage dimensions are as follows (year):\n\n"}
